[Nothing But You]

00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,490
[Episode 06]

4
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,140
What happened?

5
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:34,740
Why is Bi Xiaoran

6
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,900
dressed in my clothes?

7
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,460
What do you think?

8
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,060
They can't find you.

9
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,900
They can only make

10
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,380
Bi Xiaoran play as your stunt.

11
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,500
Qingyan, stop horsing around.

12
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,860
Go back as soon as possible.

13
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,180
If the tiger is not angry,

14
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,100
they will think I'm a pushover.

15
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,940
Isn't it?

16
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,700
Horse around.

17
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,180
I will horse around them to the end.

18
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:50,979
But if you horse around...

19
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,060
Such a high-maintenance.

20
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,300
Stop!

21
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,460
He stole my bag!

22
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,300
Catch the thief!

23
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,100
Stop there!

24
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:10,220
That's enough of you.

25
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,490
Of course, we are performing!

26
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,530
Give the bag to me!

27
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,380
Here you go.

28
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,460
Stop there!

29
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,180
Are you alright?

30
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:20,860
Thanks.

31
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,700
Your bag.

32
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,020
Be careful!

33
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,220
Let me get a hold of you.

34
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,060
Thank you.

35
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,500
Slow down.

36
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,340
Oops. Be careful.

37
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,700
Here is a stair.

38
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,460
Be careful.

39
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,060
Come on,

40
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,180
sit down slowly.

41
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,540
Bad luck!

42
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,300
How could I have come across a thief?

43
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,130
It would be slightly more dangerous

44
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,620
for a young lady to walk alone at night.

45
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:44,860
Come on,

46
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,860
I'll see if your foot

47
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,780
injury is serious.

48
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,220
I'm fine.

49
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,540
I can do it myself.

50
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,140
It is fine.

51
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,900
It is an honor of mine

52
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,460
to help a lovely lady.

53
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,260
Okay, I will check it.

54
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,890
It's a little swollen.

55
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,260
I got a bottle of ice beer here.

56
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,060
Let me ice it for you.

57
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,180
Come.

58
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,100
I can do it myself.

59
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,460
Listen,

60
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,740
You should have an agreement with the crew

61
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,780
that I will not go to work tomorrow.

62
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,220
Why do you sigh?

63
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,300
Sighing will be bad for your luck.

64
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:33,820
Come on,

65
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,100
have a drink.

66
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,860
Everything will be fine after having a drink.

67
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,620
I should not drink.

68
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,340
Trust me,

69
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,620
I am not the bad guy.

70
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,860
Look, that's okay.

71
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,500
Have a drink.

72
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,620
Come on.

73
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,220
I was happy to have you

74
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,300
help me today.

75
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,020
But when I think about

76
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,420
going to work tomorrow and

77
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,860
facing with a lot of troubles,

78
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,740
I feel annoyed.

79
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:19,070
You can talk to me if you have any problem.

80
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,060
Do you know that

81
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,540
it will be much better

82
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,660
if you talk about your troubles

83
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,770
with a stranger sometimes?

84
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,500
That's all about the actress that I am working for.

85
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,900
Ren Qingyan, she is such an annoying person.

86
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,020
She just wanted to add a little bit of scene of her.

87
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,860
She even tried her best

88
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,980
to stop the shooting.

89
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,090
The crew

90
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,480
won't give in.

91
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,380
They have me between them

92
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,620
and there is no good position for me.

93
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,060
Don't you think there must be something wrong with her?

94
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,980
There must be something wrong with her mind.

95
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,980
Always.

96
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,980
always!

97
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,580
I'm screwed.

98
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,340
How could she be like that?

99
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,060
It must be the beauty that could affect people.

100
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,540
That's impressive.

101
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,500
You didn't go for the shooting yesterday.

102
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,940
The director was very angry.

103
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,660
What was he angry for

104
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,980
when I am not angry.

105
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,660
In spite of deleting my scene,

106
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,620
he even found someone else randomly

107
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,900
to play my role.

108
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,980
Recently the fans seem to be calm,

109
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,940
right?

110
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,580
Tell them to go to the set tomorrow.

111
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,020
I don't believe that.

112
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,340
There is no need for you to be...

113
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,460
You were absent from work yesterday for no reason.

114
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,860
According to the contract of the crew,

115
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,060
you have to pay the default.

116
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,260
Do you know that?

117
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,460
That's not because I didn't want to go.

118
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,900
I am ill.

119
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,580
That's enough. Don't pretend.

120
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,420
In any case,

121
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,300
adding scenes is impossible.

122
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,620
You do not respect the actors.

123
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,660
Even I could accept

124
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,820
such few scenes,

125
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,690
my fans will not accept that.

126
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,060
Don't worry about your fans,

127
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,660
I have solved the problem for you.

128
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,780
That's all about the actress that I am working for.

129
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,380
Ren Qingyan, is such an annoying person.

130
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,540
She just wanted to add a little bit of scene of her.

131
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,660
She even tried her best to stop the shooting.

132
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,220
The crew

133
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,700
won't give in.

134
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,580
They have me between them

135
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,620
and there is no good position for me.

136
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,260
If your fans heard this,

137
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,700
they would not be angry anymore.

138
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,500
Do you think so?

139
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,380
Bi Xiaoran,

140
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,980
We're all in this together.

141
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,460
Once the recording is exposed,

142
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,940
if my reputation is affected,

143
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,570
there will be the loss of the whole drama.

144
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,980
In comparison with your absence without reason

145
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,020
and forced scene adding,

146
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,420
the loss is nothing

147
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,580
to the crew at all.

148
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,380
It all depends on you to decide

149
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,700
whether to perform in the drama anymore.

150
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,659
Bi Xiaoran!

151
00:06:59,140 --> 00:06:59,980
Sister Qingyan, listen to me.

152
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,780
I really don't know

153
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,860
what happened last night.

154
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,220
I don't know anything

155
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,180
about the recording either.

156
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,780
Oh, how's it going on?

157
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,740
I see from your expression that the problem has been solved.

158
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,620
Of course.

159
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,010
Just now, my manner,

160
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,860
my lines and expression in my eyes

161
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,300
are identical to which of my sister.

162
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,300
Perfect.

163
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,420
Okay, let me tell you,

164
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,420
it was when I went into action

165
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,500
that I could do the job of two.

166
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,860
I don't know why

167
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,460
that Pan Ting just drank a little bit

168
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,900
and she said everything she knew.

169
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,420
It took no effort to get here.

170
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,460
Yes, yes, yes.

171
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,940
Thanks to you for

172
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,260
sacrificing your beauty this time.

173
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,780
Please accept my worship.

174
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,780
Enough, don't be glib.

175
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,420
Let's go.

176
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,500
Ren Qingyan came back

177
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,900
and moved with the crew.

178
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,900
Fantastic!

179
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,740
I've said that

180
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,140
she won't be so cocky

181
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,380
without those fans who support her.

182
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,180
Thank you for your effort this time.

183
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,210
Our company is going to release a new series

184
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,020
and we will review it later.

185
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,180
You should be prepared.

186
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,740
OK.

187
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,780
Yes!

188
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,850
Intern assistance Lai Zhengling,

189
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:26,780
you play games during working hours.

190
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,460
Your salary today is deducted.

191
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,940
I am toppling towers.

192
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,340

00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:37,740
Mr. Zhou.

385
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,060
Mr. Zhou. Mr. Zhou.

386
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,100
Isn't she our best

387
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,100
famous producer

388
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,140
Bi Xiaoran?

389
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,250
Now she is my best assistant.

390
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,090
Bi Xiaoran.

391
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,660
Nice to meet you.

392
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,100
Hello.

393
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,620
Take a seat.

394
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,220
You are pretty good that

395
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,820
you can have her as assistant.

396
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,580
So-so.

397
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:01,650
Right.

398
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,140
Okay. Forget about it.

399
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,010
We want to have your company

400
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,100
as the title sponsor of

401
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,580
the project of our company.

402
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,020
How about this?

403
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,020
You are my brother.

404
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,690
I will definitely

405
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,180
help you.

406
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,100
Zhou,

407
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,050
you are the best at

408
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,060
being a loyal friend.

409
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,300
Come.

410
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,340
Come. Come. Come.

411
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,020
Drink. Drink.

412
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,100
Hello. Mom.

413
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,340
Okay, okay.

414
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:32,900
I'll go back right away.

415
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,660
You wait a minute.

416
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,340
What happened?

417
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,500
Lai.

418
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,260
My mom was in a bit of a hurry to find me

419
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,050
and I have to leave first.

420
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:39,940
Well, you hurry up and go.

421
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,580
You guys just help yourself.

422
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,820
Say hello to your mom.

423
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,260
Okay.

424
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,620
It's no problem to

425
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,060
sign up tomorrow, right?

426
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,860
No problem. No problem.

427
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,820
You can contact me at any time.

428
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,460
Okay.

429
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:46,940
I will be waiting for you.

430
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:47,820
Take it easy.

431
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,060
You are good.

432
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:52,930
How about that?

433
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,860
I did not drop the ball this time.

434
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,860
I am not expecting

435
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,940
you have something on the ball.

436
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,980
Definitely.

437
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,060
That's enough.

438
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,420
You look so woebegone.

439
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,140
It is just paying for the bill.

440
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,170
You are so mean.

441
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,620
I will give the money back to you

442
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,900
when the project is done,

443
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,500
okay?

444
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,420
No.

445
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,980
You have done great harm to

446
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,300
my young mind.

447
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,980
How much money can your bro invest?

448
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,460
Let us calculate it in this way.

449
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,940
It is hard for him to invest

450
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,980
all the fifty million.

451
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,820
But it won't be a big problem for him

452
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,540
to invest twenty or thirty million.

453
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,220
What about the rest investment?

454
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,380
I have my solution.

455
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,340
There is a brother

456
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,100
in our car racing group.

457
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,780
Brother Feng.

458
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,900
He is poor enough that

459
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,460
the only thing he has is money.

460
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,620
Let's meet him.

461
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,220
Go.

462
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,780
Oh, how sweet,

463
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,380
the way you smile at me.

464
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,210
He doesn't seem to be rich.

465
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,380
He is reliable?

466
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,820
What do you know?

467
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,820
You cannot judge a man by his appearance.

468
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,610
You don't know the world

469
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,020
of the rich people.

470
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,020
Do you know?

471
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,940
You sing well!

472
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:08,260
Brother Feng.

473
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,450
When you sing...

474
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,540
Take a seat.

475
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,460
-Come and take a sit.
-Long time no see.

476
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,810
Long time no see.

477
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,020
You sing so well.

478
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,819
You should turn off the recording when you sing.

479
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,940
Let me introduce her.

480
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,099
She is from our company.

481
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,210
Bi Xiaoran,

482
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,579
the best producer.

483
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:23,420
It is very good.

484
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,660
-Hello.
-Hello.

485
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:27,220
Then let's have a drink.

486
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:27,730
Okay.

487
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:28,300
Okay.

488
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,380
Here.

489
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:30,700
Brother Feng.

490
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:34,900
Bro,

491
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,220
why did you come to me today?

492
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:41,380
You see?

493
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,820
Brother is brother.

494
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,100
He knows that I never do anything without a reason.

495
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,820
No, brother.

496
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,620
There is a project

497
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,300
of our company.

498
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,420
It is very good.

499
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,820
Are you interested

500
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,820
in investing in the project?

501
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,940
It is a no-lose deal.

502
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,980
I sold a block of land recently

503
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,140
and earned hundreds of millions of yuan.

504
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,140
The money you need

505
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:02,940
is only a small number.

506
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,180
Really?

507
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,060
Really.

508
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,020
Brother. Brother. Brother.

509
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:11,660
Brother,

510
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,420
when shall we sign the contract?

511
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,140
What are you in such a hurry for?

512
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,420
Come to the Chenghua Hotel to sign the contract tomorrow.

513
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,580
Fantastic.

514
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,500
Bi Xiaoran, is it your name?

515
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,060
You are so beautiful.

516
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,620
Be self-respecting, Brother Feng.

517
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,180
What? Are you shy?

518
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,540
Well...

519
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:38,620
Brother Feng,

520
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,020
Let's...

521
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,300
Let's sing a song together.

522
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,060
Okay.

523
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,540
Okay?

524
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,700
Sing a song. Sing a song.

525
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,780
I will choose the song for you.

526
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,540
♫ Poor cabbage♫

527
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,180
♫ is not loved ♫

528
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,460
♫ My life♫

529
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,180
You come back so late.

530
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,740
Where did you go for fun?

531
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,660
What are you doing?

532
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,860
For fun?

533
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,140
We lose the general title sponsor of The Journey of the Youth.

534
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,180
Is it easy for me to find a new investor?

535
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,180
I was dead,

536
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,020
something burning paper.

537
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,460
It's all about the money.

538
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,410
How can you be tired?

539
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,220
How can I be tired?

540
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,770
Do you know what happened

541
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,180
to me today?

542
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,500
I paid for dinner

543
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,500
and almost got harassed.

544
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,660
Is this human work?

545
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,740
Your professional ability is

546
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,490
not as good as your sister's.

547
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,900
Tell me, how much do you need?

548
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,620
Maybe I can invest in the project.

549
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,780
You said that.

550
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,420
Five million?

551
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,730
Fine.

552
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:36,820
I can invest.

553
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,740
You can have the royalties.

554
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,380
It's fifty million.

555
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,260
Good night!

556
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,060
The Journey of the Youth is your child.

557
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:45,900
How can you bear to be so

558
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,820
ruthless,

559
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,860
indifferent,

560
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:48,980
and irresponsible?

561
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,380
I don't want this child anymore.

562
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,060
Throw it away.

563
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,380
Qing Yanfei.

564
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:53,580
Good.

565
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,140
You are such a poor person.

566
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,660
Sure enough,

567
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,900
the writer has no future.

568
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,420
It would be better to sell a block of land.

569
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,700
You don't know what happened today.

570
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,860
That Brother Feng,

571
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,300
who met me for the first time,

572
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,500
said he will give me a Ferrari.

573
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,210
I didn't think that would happen to me.

574
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,820
That's true.

575
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,690
In your lifetime,

576
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:12,730
did anyone give you

577
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:13,700
a rose?

578
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,380
Giving you a Ferrari?

579
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,140
Just dream about it.

580
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,660
Who has not received the flower?

581
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:19,060
Indeed.

582
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,300
You have received the flower.

583
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:21,980
In those days,

584
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,940
the handsome boy from the class next

585
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,580
gave you a bouquet of roses.

586
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,820
At that time, you said:

587
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,610
Really?

588
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,340
I do.

589
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,290
And then

590
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,740
the handsome boy said:

591
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,260
I love you,

592
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,580
Bi Xiaoran.

593
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,540
I keep the photo, do you want to see it

594
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,100
and reminisce?

595
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,700
You still have this kind of photo?

596
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,820
Delete it.

597
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,460
No.

598
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,340
I'm going to take it out and laugh at you

599
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,540
# -when I am old. 
-Will you delete it?

600
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,260
Delete it.

601
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:40,860
No.

602
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,330
Will you delete it?

603
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,020
No.

604
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,220
Mr. Lai.

605
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,740
Good night. Mr. Lai.

606
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:52,780
Mr. Lai.

607
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,540
Good timing.

608
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,570
I have something interesting to show you.

609
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,380
Treasure.

610
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,220
If you dare to say it, you will die.

611
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,020
You are right.

612
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,260
He shouldn't see it.

613
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,860
This is a little secret

614
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,740
between us.

615
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,620
Then I go to sleep.

616
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:09,780
Good night.

617
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,260
What?

618
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,620
It's weird.

619
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,940
What time is it?

620
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,060
Why did he go to bed so early?

621
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,420
Is he angry?

622
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:20,980
Why are you worried about him?

623
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,460
Let him play by himself.

624
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,570
No, I need to check it.

625
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,540
Jiangjiang, it is weird of you.

626
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,900
It is clear that you are afraid that he will make advances to you,

627
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,340
so, you specifically asked me to

628
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,100
come and protect you.

629
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,220
Now how it feels as if

630
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,300
you're making advances to him.

631
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,220
Nonsense.

632
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,780
We are only friends.

633
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,100
# Listen, his expression

634
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,850
is deliberately performed for you.

635
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,380
After many days of observation,

636
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,500
Lai Zhengyi

637
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,580
is a green tea man.

638
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,860
I didn't touch

639
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,900
the bowl of soup that day,

640
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,860
it was spilled.

641
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,620
These are all hoaxes that

642
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,460
he has directed and acted out.

643
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,940
Everything he did is for your sympathy.

644
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,020
What's your expression?

645
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,700
Qing Yanfei.

646
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,060
I didn't expect you to be

647
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,820
the man talking behind others' backs.

648
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,060
In the face of the villain,

649
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,380
I will look at you with small eyes in the future.

650
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,100
Mr. Lai.

651
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,850
I want to report to you that

652
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,860
today Lai Zhengling and I went for the investment

653
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,940
and it was relatively good.

654
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,380
I didn't expect Lai Zhengling

655
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,780
to be reliable.

656
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,340
You must have a hard time.

657
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,740
You...

658
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,780
Are you having anything

659
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,740
to worry about?

660
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,820
Why are you unhappy?

661
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,460
Don't refuse to talk.

662
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,500
What happened?

663
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,900
I just feel that

664
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,420
the friendship of three

665
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,180
is so crowded.

666
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,020
It is so crowded that

667
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,170
such a big villa

668
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,660
cannot accommodate me.

669
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,140
Uh?

670
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,180
Why would you say that?

671
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:20,780
Hurry up. Hurry up.

672
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,060
My hair clipped in the zipper.

673
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,500
Help me to make it out.

674
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,060
Come here.

675
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:24,700
Mr. Lai, drink some water.

676
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,220
Hurry up.

677
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,460
That's hurt!

678
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,380
That's hurt!

679
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,220
Don't move!

680
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,340
Here, Lili.

681
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,780
Sorry.

682
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,940
I didn't realize that.

683
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,580
It is because

684
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,660
I grew up with Qin Yanfei.

685
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,460
We don't distinguish between each other

686
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,940
in most of the time.

687
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,820
Though he seems to be such a person

688
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,100
who is usually hanging,

689
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:47,970
he is actually a good person.

690
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,340
Indeed.

691
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,330
After all, you are childhood sweethearts

692
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,780
who grew up together.

693
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,540
Who can I be?

694
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,180
Why would you say that?

695
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:03,980
Do you regard me as a friend?

696
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,460
Of course.

697
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,900
But there are so many secrets

698
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,980
between you and Qin Yanfei.

699
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,060
There is no room for me.

700
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,820
Those are not secrets.

701
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,380
That's my short hair.

702
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,130
Never mind.

703
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,060
Whatever.

704
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:26,980
I confess.

705
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,460
It was,

706
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,860
it was when I was in high school.

707
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,620
One day, the most handsome boy from the class next

708
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,060
gave me a big bouquet of flowers.

709
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,500
He put it on my desk.

710
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,940
As it was on my desk, I thought

711
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,370
it was given to me.

712
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,050
But he actually said it in front of

713
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,980
everyone in the class:

714
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,340
Bi Xiaoran,

715
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,420
will you be my girlfriend?

716
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,300
Everybody laughed hard.

717
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,900
I was about to dive into the ground.

718
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,090
It's nothing.

719
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,300
Privileged people with others' attention

720
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,300
like you

721
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,820
certainly won't understand how I felt.

722
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,900
This is the first time

723
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,850
and the only time in my lifetime that I received the flowers.

724
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,580
It turned out to be a big mistake.

725
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,740
Because of this,

726
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,180
I was ridiculed by my classmates for three years.

727
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,340
That damn Qin Yanfei,

728
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,620
He laughed the loudest

729
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,260
and always takes the lead in mentioning this affair.

730
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,660
Because he took the video

731
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,340
as the evidence to threaten me.

732
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,260
Therefore, I said it was my short hair.

733
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,020
Do you think

734
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,580
I'm so sentimental

735
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,340
and it is a shame?

736
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,330
No.

737
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,610
You are lying.

738
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,790
You laughed just now.

739
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:34,900
I saw it.

740
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,940
In my whole life,

741
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,060
I have been living under the light of my sister.

742
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,380
She is glittering.

743
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,940
But others

744
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,940
cannot even notice my shadow.

745
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,300
Sunshine is light.

746
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,380
Candle fire is also light.

747
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,580
Just because no one courting you

748
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,820
doesn't mean you have no value.

749
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,020
From my point of view,

750
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,980
you have your own personality

751
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,100
and your own features.

752
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,610
You are the unique Jiang Lili.

753
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,580
Lai Zhengyi,

754
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,580
you are such a good person.

755
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,220
It's been four hours.

756
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,660
He should have arrived even he rides a bike.

757
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,860
Wait for me to call him again.

758
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,980
Zhou shouldn't have stood me up.

759
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,420
Otherwise, we could go to his home.

760
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,580
He answered.

761
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,900
-Hello.
-Hello.

762
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,820
Zhou, Zhou.

763
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,100
Didn't we make an appointment to sign today?

764
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,140
Where have you been?

765
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:42,900
Are you Lai?

766
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,140
Uh,

767
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,170
hello, aunt.

768
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,380
I'm looking for Zhou Shen for something.

769
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:47,940
We...

770
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,660
Lai,

771
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,900
I send Shen abroad for further study,

772
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,180
and we are now abroad.

773
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,820
Lai will become a successful person in the future.

774
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,460
Don't influence him anymore.

775
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:55,940
Aunt, I...

776
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,940
Don't always call him.

777
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:02,820
Well...

778
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,340
Zhou Shen and I

779
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,540
are good friends.

780
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:11,020
It's just that his mother misunderstood me a bit.

781
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,900
Give the 1300 yuan I paid for the dinner back.

782
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,220
You scared me.

783
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,100
We still have Brother Feng.

784
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,100
See.

785
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,380
It will be reliable this time.

786
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,180
I have told you that

787
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,900
you can count on me.

788
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:34,700
Brother Feng.

789
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:35,820
Here you are.

790
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,780
Lai, come and sit here.

791
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,860
Take a seat.

792
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,820
Take a seat.

793
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,540
The money you want is

794
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,060
a dime a dozen for me,

795
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,020
that's easy.

796
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,420
That's the way you are.

797
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,340
I said you must be reliable.

798
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,580
Contract, contract, contract.

799
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,060
Brother Feng,

800
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,460
this is

801
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,980
the contract of our project.

802
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:56,580
How about

803
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,500
sigh it today?

804
00:27:58,730 --> 00:27:59,370
Take it easy.

805
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,620
Before that

806
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,860
I need you to

807
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,420
do me a favor.

808
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,380
Can I help you?

809
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,180
Brother Feng,

810
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,020
that's it,

811
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,620
I can undergo the most severe trials

812
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,780
as long as

813
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,420
you say it.

814
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:11,940
Mmm...

815
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,140
Recently

816
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,180
I bought a block of land recently.

817
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,100
There is something wrong with the capital chain.

818
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,780
How about lending me two million first?

819
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,740
When the project successes,

820
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,460
It would be possible for me to

821
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,140
spend money in Hollywood for you

822
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,060
to make a movie.

823
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,060
Right?

824
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,780
Brother, is he inside there?

825
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:28,740
-I have meeting to attend.
-Don't leave.

826
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,620
I have to leave.

827
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,180
Wait, Brother Feng, Brother Feng.

828
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,540
Stop, don't run away!

829
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,340
Hurry up.

830
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,660
You're so unreliable.

831
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:35,500
No.

832
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,900
You can't blame me for that.

833
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,020
How could I know if it was real

834
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,300
when he was bragging?

835
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,220
Instead of looking for your cronies,

836
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,740
you should go back to your dad and ask for money.

837
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,300
My dad?

838
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,780
I... I... I will not.

839
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,180
No wonder you live in a conference room every day.

840
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,740
It turned out that you had been swept out of the house.

841
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,970
What do you mean "sweep out of the house"?

842
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:54,260
Watch what you say.

843
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,580
I was running away on my own.

844
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,940
They sneakily

845
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,380
locked my credit card.

846
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,460
I will demonstrate.

847
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,210
I will rebel.

848
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:03,100
I will protest.

849
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:03,820
Protest.

850
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,020
You just don't admit it.

851
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,660
Moreover,

852
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,020
What are you proud of?

853
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,620
You should also be responsible for

854
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,700
failing to find a general title sponsor.

855
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,180
How dare you say that?

856
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,500
Who should be responsible for that?

857
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,420
Okay. Okay. Okay.

858
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,300
Don't shirk our responsibilities to each other.

859
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:18,980
Okay?

860
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,140
I just analyzed the

861
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,380
reasons for our failure.

862
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,420
What do you think?

863
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,820
The reason is that you are too unreliable.

864
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,490
No.

865
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,810
The reason is that men are too unreliable.

866
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:28,020
If men were reliable,

867
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,100
the pig could climb the tree.

868
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,620
I don't know if Lai Zhengling

869
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,180
can do it this time.

870
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,300
If not...

871
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,340
How could power outage happens

872
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,620
in such a big villa.

873
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:50,900
Mr. Lai.

874
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,420
Mr. Lai.

875
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,580
I am back.

876
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,580
Mr. Lai.

877
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:00,940
What's that?

878
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,420
Do you like it?

879
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,900
Mr. Lai.

880
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,180
Did you say that

881
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,940
no one had given you flowers?

882
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,140
Then I will be the first one.

883
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,420
So many flowers.

884
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,260
Are all those flowers

885
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,500
for me?

886
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,130
Yes.

887
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,420
Around the world...

888
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,300
No, no, no.

889
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,620
Around the universe, you are the best...

890
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,940
What the best?

891
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,260
Boss.

892
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,100
Roommate.

893
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,100
Landlord.

894
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,940
I will take some photos,

895
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,300
and post them in a moment.

896
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:30,980
Here.

897
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,610
We also take some pictures.

898
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,820
I am so happy

899
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,420
to receive so many flowers.

900
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,700
I am going to take a few more photos.

901
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,100
One, two, three.

902
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,140
This is the man who gave me flowers.

903
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,860
He is my best landlord,

904
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:58,740
boss

905
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,060
and roommate.
