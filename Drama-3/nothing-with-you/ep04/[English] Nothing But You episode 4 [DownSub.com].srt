00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,540
Yuck.

195
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,580
Obviously, someone is helping her.

196
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,460
Bear down menacingly,

197
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,780
it is hard to deal with.

198
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,380
Are you afraid that Jiang Lili

199
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,130
will not do well?

200
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,060
Actually,

201
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,220
she is not Bi Xiaoran.

202
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:13,540
Right,

203
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,140
she is indeed not as smart as Bi Xiaoran,

204
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:16,900
also the skills.

205
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,020
But

206
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,740
she's no worse than anyone.

207
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,820
Adversity makes one stronger.

208
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,460
Since she wants to work hard

209
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,340
and want to fall,

210
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,380
I will support her.

211
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,300
If she falls,

212
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,570
I can help her.

213
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,380
That’s nice of you.

214
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,740
Mr. Lai, Mr. Lai.

215
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,810
Look at this one.

216
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:41,700
It is very awesome.

217
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,260
What is it?

218
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,180
Have a look.

219
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,290
These are evidence that

220
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,540
Su Shan's leg is all right.

221
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,140
She pretends all.

222
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,620
I came up with a clever plan today,

223
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,340
and finally revealed the secret.

224
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,530
Look!

225
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,100
You sure that

226
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,900
she is standing?

227
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,620
Uh...

228
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,220
Her feet are here.

229
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:01,390
Uh...

230
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,820
How is this almost completely blocked out?

231
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,300
What about this one?

232
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,100
I obviously got it.

233
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,580
Isn't it a waste of time?

234
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,260
I can't believe it.

235
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:11,980
It is ok.

236
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,810
As long as we are sure that Su Shan's leg injury is fake

237
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:14,820
and the acting is real,

238
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,580
we can easily

239
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,540
expose her.

240
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,980
It's not easy.

241
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,130
Such a perfect scheme I have.

242
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,300
There's something.

243
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,220
What?

244
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:29,740
An insect.

245
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,540
An insect.

246
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:33,570
You...

247
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,380
You are also afraid.

248
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,380
I... I...

249
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,220
I am also afraid.

250
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,020
It...

251
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,770
It can't

252
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,920
get out, right?

253
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,200
Maybe yes.

254
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,020
I am sorry.

255
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,340
I am brave enough.

256
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,500
I'm afraid that this insect

257
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,260
has four feet and

258
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,380
four legs.

259
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,660
Unlike some girls who are afraid of everything.

260
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,740
And they are also afraid of...

261
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,420
Mr. Lai.

262
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,100
Tomorrow Su Shan

263
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,380
will host a fan meeting.

264
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,020
Yes.

265
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,100
What's wrong?

266
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:32,810
[Su Shan's fan meeting]

267
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,860
I spent 999 yuan for this ticket

268
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,780
in order to see Sister Su Shan.

269
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,860
It won't rain today, right?

270
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,180
Why hasn't she come yet?

271
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,420
Sister Su Shan.

272
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,220
Sister Su Shan, I love you.

273
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,660
Thank you.

274
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,540
Hello hello.

275
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,330
Thank you.

276
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,740
Thank you all for coming.

277
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,460
Thank you all for caring about me.

278
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,370
My leg has gotten a lot better

279
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,860
through this period of treatment.

280
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,100
That's great.

281
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,040
Thank you.

282
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,660
But my doctor told me that

283
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,700
I still need a period of rest.

284
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,100
Therefore, you may not be able

285
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,770
to see me during this period,

286
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,090
but I also hope that

287
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,060
you will support me a lot.

288
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,250
My heart will always be with you.

289
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,200
I will support you all the time.
-Definitely yes, I will.

290
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,140
Take care of yourself at home.

291
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,260
I'm sorry, guys.

292
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,600
Su Shan still needs a good rest.

293
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:21,880
Today's fan meeting

294
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,920
is over.

295
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,210
Take your time. Take your time.

296
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,170
-Sister Su Shan, this is my gift for you.
-Thanks.

297
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,200
-Please sign for me!
-Thanks.

298
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,220
Excuse me.

299
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,500
Sister Su Shan, I love you.

300
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,020
I am your big fan.

301
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,340
This is my flower for you.

302
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,860
Sister Su Shan, your leg...

303
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,420
How does she stand up?

304
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:55,550
Are you ok?

305
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,300
It is.

306
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,660
Hurry up, Hurry up!

307
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,610
How is your leg?

308
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,460
Is the injury fake?

309
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,180
Sister Su Shan.

310
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,940
Mr. Lai's method is very great.

311
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,820
Bye bye.

312
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:19,980
Mr. Lai.

313
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,980
The mission is accomplished.

314
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,780
I told you that

315
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,700
Su Shan made an exhibition of herself

316
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,420
and she fainted.

317
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,740
I'd like to call her

318
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,580
moral black hole,

319
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,780
acting terminator and

320
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,420
the king of brainless money making.

321
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,060
Alright. Got it.

322
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:32,900
Thanks for your hard work.

323
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,340
Go back to have a rest,

324
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,740
the remaining things to me.

325
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,410
Ok.

326
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,580
What a wonderful method.

327
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,170
Uh, right.

328
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,690
Today, she goes against her public image.

329
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,530
let me see that

330
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,100
there must be a lot of scolding on the Internet.

331
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,370
[Su Shan goes against her public image.]

332
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,420
Let me see.

333
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,380
Her leg is ok.

334
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,900
It's pretending.

335
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,660
What?

336
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,500
She healed her leg because of bees by accident.

337
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,020
God's darling, Su Shan.

338
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,130
Medical miracle?

339
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,820
What kind of fangirls are these?

340
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,020
They can write anything

341
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,360
Uh...

342
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,660
which makes me very angry.

343
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,780
I'm going to show you

344
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,820
what a true medical miracle is.

345
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,300
Wake up you guys with cerebral palsy.

346
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,660
I'm responsible for telling you

347
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,300
Su Shan's leg injury is a hoax.

348
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,180
The doctor said that

349
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,660
if she come later,

350
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,930
she could get off the ground

351
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,300
and run after Bolt.

352
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:50,940
The reason why

353
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,180
she hyped up her injury

354
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,580
is to fight against the joint statement

355
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,060
issued by the major platforms.

356
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:55,860
She use despicable means to

357
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,220
keep the sky-high remuneration of

358
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,620
herself

359
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,780
and some graceless celebrities.

360
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,020
She held a fan meeting

361
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:01,980
at the hospital

362
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,300
today just to make money.

363
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,620
An admission ticket is nearly 5,000 yuan.

364
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,420
I have never seen

365
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,940
such a brazen person.

366
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,580
You people who earn 3,000 a month

367
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,180
still go to show love to

368
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,980
hose who earn thirty million a month,

369
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,090
what do you mean?

370
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,140
The maid feels

371
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,700
that the master's life is difficult,

372
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,260
and finally spent money to see the liar,

373
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,700
You guys control the comments and explain desperately for her.

374
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,250
Do you have problems with your three views or

375
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,500
have obstacles in your thinking?

376
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,140
I suggest you study

377
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,420
Marx's Das Kapital.

378
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,580
As a leek,

379
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,420
you should also improve your professional quality.

380
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,310
[Sister Xiaoran teaches you to be a person.]

381
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,820
Thank you for watching.

382
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,170
That's what I'm going to tell you today.

383
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:32,980
Hurry up, Xiao He.

384

00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,550
Transaction failed.

576
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,630
[Failed transaction. This card will not allow to trade]

577
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,500
I am sorry.

578
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,420
This card doesn't work.

579
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,780
Give it to me.

580
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,310
[Amount ￥5000 Please enter your online password]

581
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,500
The machine shows a failed transaction.

582
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,490
You can either pay in cash

583
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:57,550
or software.

584
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,500
Wait a moment.

585
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,220
Take it easy.

586
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:09,740
Hello.

587
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:11,780
Dad.

588
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:12,740
Uh...

589
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,970
Are you serious about this?

590
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,100
You asshole.

591
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:17,780
You smashed your brother's office.

592
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,620
hat you still have the face to call me.

593
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,220
Can you catch a break?

594
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,740
Has Lai Zhengyi complained to you?

595
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,300
That's all he is capable of.

596
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,380
I don't need him to tell me.

597
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,700
Your behavior is

598
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,660
under my control.

599
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,390
Uh... Dad.

600
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,260
Well, just do this.

601
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,980
You unfreeze my card first.

602
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,740
Ok?

603
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,340
How can you unite with outsiders

604
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,980
to deal with your own son?

605
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,180
Lai Zhengling.

606
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,380
He is your elder brother.

607
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,300
You need to respect him.

608
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,020
I have already discussed with Zhengyi.

609
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,020
For the next two months,

610
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:42,970
you need to work hard

611
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:43,980
in his company.

612
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,660
You won't get any money from the family.

613
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,170
It's up to you.

614
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,500
Who is my brother?

615
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,220
No way.

616
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,180
If not,

617
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,700
go to the street and beg.

618
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,580
I I I...

619
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,860
Even if I beg on the street, I won't do it.

620
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,020
This settles it then!

621
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,540
Dad,

622
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,370
I won't do it

623
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,220
more than two months.

624
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:01,860
Ok?

625
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,610
I am sorry.

626
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:10,340
We don't accept credit here.

627
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:16,890
[Non-staff are not allowed to enter without permission.]

628
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,380
Anyway, things are betting here.

629
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,620
Take care of my car.

630
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,540
Go back to club quickly.

631
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,170
Otherwise, you can't take your car away.

632
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:27,490
Please.

633
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,140
Mr. Lai Jr.

634
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,250
Here is your workplace.

635
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,770
You can get familiar with the environment first.

636
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,180
I'll explain the work in a while.

637
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,460
Ok.

638
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,180
Be off.

639
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,980
Ok, I will.

640
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,060
Such a narrow place.

641
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,610
I can't stretch my legs.

642
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,140
What is your name?

643
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,060
Hello, my name is Ding Dong.

644
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,580
Just call me Assistant Ding.

645
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,580
What is it?

646
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,420
Bitch.

647
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,260
Go and make me a coffee.

648
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,010
Make me a coffee!

649
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,900
Hey!

650
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,980
Are you

651
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,220
deaf?

652
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,750
I really don't try so hard.

653
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,940
You are exaggerating!

654
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,930
I have no obligation to serve you tea and water.

655
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:38,570
In terms of seniority,

656
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,820
you should call me senior.

657
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,460
I call you senior?

658
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,820
You are only a assistant.

659
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,580
The company is mine.

660
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,270
Go go go.

661
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,080
So crazy you are.

662
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,200
Mr. Lai Jr.

663
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,940
Your coffee.

664
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,740
Look at this guy,

665
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,980
he is cleverer than you.

666
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,580
He came to the company today.

667
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,110
The bastard caused trouble

668
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,310
after he came back.

669
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:01,830
Zhengyi.

670
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,350
Don't mind him.

671
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,830
You are his brother.

672
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,200
Discipline him more in the company

673
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,840
in the future instead of me.

674
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,510
I will.

675
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,020
It's getting late.

676
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,130
Have a good rest.

677
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,340
Why sigh?

678
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,460
s it because of Lai Zhengling?

679
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,100
n fact, sometimes

680
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,380
I envy you,

681
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,260
your sisters have such a good relationship.

682
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:39,410
From childhood to adulthood,

683
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,090
my sister and I often have conflicts.

684
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,530
She's bad-tempered and

685
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,570
harsh.

686
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,760
She reprimands me every day.

687
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,410
But in times of crisis,

688
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:48,250
she is always the first

689
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,600
to rush out to protect me.

690
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:51,770
You are really sisters.

691
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:52,890
Blood is thicker than water.

692
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,600
Unlike me.

693
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,570
Mr. Lai

694
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:57,690
You don't have to pity me.

695
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,950
My adoptive parents worked hard

696
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,250
in the early years

697
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,570
and didn't want children

698
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,560
Later, when they got older,

699
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,000
they adopted me

700
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,250
because they couldn't bear children.

701
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,170
Unexpectedly,

702
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,410
Lai Zhengling was born a year later.

703
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:14,890
But even so,

704
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,170
they still treat me as their own,

705
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,920
but Lai Zhengling always hates me,

706
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,270
parents are sandwiched between us.

707
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:25,960
A bowl of water is difficult

708
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:27,930
to balance after all.

709
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,760
I thought that

710
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,330
a perfect person like him

711
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,970
would not have troubles.

712
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,800
Now,

713
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,880
it seems that he also have unpleasant things.

714
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,330
Mr. Lai.

715
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:42,760
Are you sleepy?

716
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:44,880
what is the matter?

717
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:46,960
Do you want to play

718
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,600
something exciting?

719
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,770
Something exciting?

720
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,600
Is that what I think?

721
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,410
Horror movie!

722
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:06,170
What do you think of it?

723
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:07,360
Is it exciting enough?

724
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,770
That's it.

725
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,130
It seems that

726
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,280
I am too narrow-minded.

727
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,490
Oh,

728
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,370
I like to eat while

729
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,000
watching a movie.

730
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:22,880
Horror movie is more relaxing.

731
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:25,890
The film starts! It starts.

732
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:26,810
The first five minutes of a movie

733
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:27,810
are the most valuable.

734
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:36,850
What is this?

735
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:49,290
oh,

736
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:52,960
you are so timid.

737
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,000
Why you watch it?

738
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:55,410
No.

739
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,520
My friend introduced me and

740
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,600
said that this is mainly funny,

741
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,370
supplemented by horror.

742
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,530
I don't know why it's so scary.

743
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:01,760
Do be afraid.

744
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:02,730
I am here.

745
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,210
Aren't you afraid?

746
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,650
How can I protect you

747
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:09,010
if I'm afraid?

748
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,180
It is ok.

749
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:24,950
[Help me.]

750
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,880
[Help me.]

751
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:27,970
[Help me.]

752
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,090
Help!

753
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,440
I don't want to watch it anymore.

754
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:54,370
Mr. Lai.

755
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,210
can I sleep

756
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,450
with you

757
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,690
tonight?

758
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:03,250
Uh...

759
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,030
It's not good to

760
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,610
be alone.

761
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:07,730
Oh,

762
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,250
no.

763
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,690
My room

764
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:13,440
is not clean.

765
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,170
Then

766
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,610
you sleep in my room and

767
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,400
I sleep in the guest room.

768
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,890
Mr. Lai. Wait, please.

769
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,080
You sleep on the bed,

770
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,560
I can sleep on the ground.

771
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,730
Have a good night.

772
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:32,530
Get up quickly.

773
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,490
It is easy to catch cold.

774
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:34,930
It is ok.

775
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:36,160
I can fit.

776
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,730
Take a rest quickly.

777
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,040
In fact,

778
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,450
there's one thing I haven't told you.

779
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,850
What?

780
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:51,720
This house used to

781
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,730
be a haunted house.

782
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:55,770
Oh.

783
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,730
After the previous owner was killed by her husband,

784
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:00,850
the body was under the bed

785
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:01,960
for a month.

786
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,570
Oh.

787
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,340
Later, I heard that

788
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:06,770
something strange

789
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,160
would crawl out from under the bed

790
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,250
in the middle of the night.

791
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,640
Strange strange...

792
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,010
Strange things?

793
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:17,320
Mr. Lai.

794
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:18,970
Why don't we

795
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,810
sleep together tonight?

796
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,130
We can care for each other tonight.

797
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,310
It is not good.

798
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,420
Do not worry.

799
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,810
I am not a slut.

800
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:30,890
I am upright.

801
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:33,290
If you don't sleep,

802
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,990
I will go to the launching ceremony

803
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,700
with dark circles under my eyes.

804
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:36,370
Mr. Lai.

805
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:36,970
Good night.

806
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,050
I have no idea about what to do with you.

807
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:51,400
Mr. Lai.

808
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,610
I have a presumptuous request.

809
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,530
You say.

810
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,610
Can you sleep with the light on?

811
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,720
Of course.

812
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:02,450
You

813
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:04,570
can tell me

814
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:05,570
if you have other requirements?

815
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,130
Can you stay closer

816
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:08,970
with me?

817
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,280
I think

818
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,490
I am in horror.

819
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:15,360
Of course.

820
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:22,850
Mr. Lai.

821
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:23,920
Have you slept?

822
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:24,730
Yes.

823
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,010
Can you turn around?

824
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,180
I can't sleep

825
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,390
without looking at you.

826
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,010
Alright.

827
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,450
Mr. Lai.

828
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,010
Do you hear something?

829
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,120
No.

830
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,130
Isn't there something

831
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,810
strange crawling out from

832
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:44,690
under your bed?

833
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,290
So let's cover the quilt

834
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:49,200
Ok.
