=Episode 12=

3
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,150
My father...

4
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,239
He just sent me away.

5
00:01:53,775 --> 00:01:55,375
You're not alone.

6
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,850
What you've lost

7
00:01:59,025 --> 00:02:00,825
will come back to you.

8
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,399
When I first got back home,

9
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,525
I complained a lot.

10
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,150
But gradually,

11
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:20,050
I calmed down.

12
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,179
I often think of

13
00:02:24,725 --> 00:02:26,565
what you instructed me
on the first day of class.

14
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,570
You asked me to think about

15
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,000
how to make contributions

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,440
as a grown man.

17
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:41,050
I'm no longer a child,

18
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,409
but a grown man.

19
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,275
I shouldn't be stuck in old injustices.

20
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,650
Instead, I should focus on the future

21
00:02:52,275 --> 00:02:54,025
and take on responsibilities

22
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,600
to protect my family.

23
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,499
Jiashang,

24
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,675
you want to protect your family.

25
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,525
But I have to destroy it.

26
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
One day,

27
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,639
we'll be irreconcilable opposites

28
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,040
and even have to fight desperately.

29
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,116
Thank you, Jiashang.

30
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,279
You saved my life.

31
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,020
I didn't do anything.

32
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,375
He just let go of you.

33
00:03:31,075 --> 00:03:32,775
You made him let go of me.

34
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,320
You scared him

35
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,775
so that he didn't dare to hurt me.

36
00:03:45,675 --> 00:03:46,875
Miss Feng.

37
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:52,325
Luckily, I still have you.

38
00:04:08,425 --> 00:04:09,240
Mr. Jiashang,

39
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:10,434
something is wrong.

40
00:04:12,075 --> 00:04:13,114
Go check it out.

41
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:15,850
Miss Feng,

42
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,959
go with me.

43
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,380
I...

44
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,525
What happened?

45
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:30,849
This man was bringing the meal
to Guo Dazhuang.

46
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:32,060
There was a marinated egg in it.

47
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,720
He was gluttonous

48
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,125
and ate the egg.

49
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,320
Then he was poisoned to death.

50
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:37,880
Where did he get the meal?

51
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,700
From the small kitchen.

52
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:40,525
I've had the kitchen besieged.

53
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:42,399
Everyone in the kitchen swore

54
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,399
that they only prepared a bowl of rice

55
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,200
and a plate of greens

56
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,799
and no one prepared the egg.

57
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,600
Now this man is dead.

58
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,160
We don't know where he got the egg.

59
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,200
Take him away

60
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,480
and bury him.

61
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,320
Yes.

62
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,155
Your old boss

63
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,799
is quite considerate.

64
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,880
To make sure you would die,

65
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,359
he prepared severe toxins for you.

66
00:05:19,725 --> 00:05:20,800
Mr. Jia... Mr. Jiashang...

67
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,640
Mr. Jiashang.

68
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,480
I... I... I...

69
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,625
I'm desperately regretting it.

70
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,760
Mr. Jiashang, I beg you.

71
00:05:28,925 --> 00:05:30,950
I beg you. Please save my life.

72
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,119
I'll be your loyal servant,
Mr. Jiashang.

73
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,679
I'll tell you anything...

74
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:38,000
Anything I know.

75
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,679
Looks like a dead man threatens
better than a bullet.

76
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,600
Tell me about it.

77
00:05:50,425 --> 00:05:52,679
Think carefully before you start.

78
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:54,150
Don't miss anything again.

79
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,720
I'm indeed paid

80
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,200
to transmit intel to outsiders.

81
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,920
But we do specific jobs.

82
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,559
We've never seen each other.

83
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,920
I only transmit the intel.

84
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,480
As for what happens out of here,

85
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:06,320
I...

86
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,679
I know nothing about it.

87
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,320
Mr. Jiashang,

88
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,200
I do this
because I'm in gambling debt.

89
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,119
And my mother is sick.

90
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:14,279
Get to the point!

91
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,750
How do you usually get the intel?

92
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,710
My superior says

93
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,380
there's an old locust tree
beside the pavilion

94
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,375
and there's a hole in it.

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,825
I'm asked

96
00:06:28,075 --> 00:06:29,279
to check the hole every two days.

97
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,240
Once there's a note in it,

98
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,640
I deliver it.

99
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,200
Where to deliver it?

100
00:06:36,075 --> 00:06:38,635
The Foundling Home
at the east street corner.

101
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,175
I'm asked

102
00:06:40,175 --> 00:06:41,935
to put the note in an old newspaper

103
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:43,175
and then

104
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,009
throw it...

105
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,559
Throw it...

106
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:48,279
In the drum

107
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,480
outside the hall.

108
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,320
They usually pay me

109
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,920
in the middle of the night

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,559
when I can't see anyone clearly.

111
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,810
When was the last time
you delivered a note?

112
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,586
It was...

113
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,040
Right. Right.

114
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,920
It was

115
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,119
the day after the Mid-Autumn Festival.

116
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,279
Early that morning,

117
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,079
I saw a note in the hole

118
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,500
and then I delivered it.

119
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,250
What's on the note?

120
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,279
I stole a glance at it.

121
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:16,959
It was a piece of blank paper.

122
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:19,200
Not even a single word was on it.

123
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,150
Blank paper?

124
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,519
Don't you know who wrote the note?

125
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,480
I... I...

126
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,480
I'm not very clever.

127
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:27,450
But I'm aware

128
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,839
that the more I know,

129
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:31,425
the bigger trouble I'll be in.

130
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,399
Have you contacted Miss Sun

131
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,480
of West Hall?

132
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,975
Miss Sun?

133
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,079
She...

134
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:39,880
She...

135
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,239
When she read books in the garden,

136
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,279
I looked at her from behind.

137
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:45,559
I didn't even see her face.

138
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:46,700
Are you sure?

139
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,475
Yes. Yes.

140
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:49,922
Mr. Jia... Mr. Jiashang.

141
00:07:50,075 --> 00:07:51,880
I swear to God

142
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,300
that what I'm saying is true.

143
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,200
The old locust tree
beside the octagonal pavilion?

144
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,959
Yes, yes.

145
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:56,839
That's it.

146
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:57,625
At...

147
00:07:58,271 --> 00:07:59,750
At eye level,

148
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,269
there's a hole as big as a fist.

149
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,540
How long have you been
transmitting the intel?

150
00:08:08,175 --> 00:08:10,094
It was last April

151
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,519
that they bought me over.

152
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:14,320
Nothing happened

153
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,120
until this Mid-Autumn Festival.

154
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,675
Mr. Jia... Mr. Jiashang.

155
00:08:18,425 --> 00:08:19,544
I swear to God.

156
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,279
I only did it this once.

157
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:25,990
Miss Feng,

158
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,450
how do you think I should punish him?

159
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,850
He betrayed his master.

160
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,200
He should be severely punished.

161
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,300
Mr. Jia...

162
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,766
If you say so,

163
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,625
take him away.

164
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,625
Mr. Jia... Mr. Jiashang.

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,799
Mr. Jiashang.

166
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,400
I kidnapped Miss Feng

167
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,000
in a fit of anxiety.

168
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,025
I'm sorry, Mr. Jiashang.

169
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,280
Miss Feng,

170
00:08:59,525 --> 00:09:00,919
you're the bigger person.

171
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,689
Please... Please spare my life.

172
00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:03,850
Please spare me.

173
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,361
Actually,

174
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,479
we can make use of him.

175
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:12,850
Excuse me?

176
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,625
Someone bought him over

177
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,305
to get the intel of your family.

178
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:18,239
You can also let him

179
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,060
get their intel for you.

180
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,280
Have a long-term plan

181
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,520
to get something bigger.

182
00:09:24,825 --> 00:09:26,185
Isn't it a better solution?

183
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,875
Right, right.

184
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:30,919
I can do that.

185
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:31,799
Mr. Jiashang.

186
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:32,919
Mr. Jiashang. Mr. Jiashang.

187
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
I remember that man's voice.

188
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,525
What have you got?

189
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,500
Two servants have the problem
of corruption and theft.

190
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,139
The other servants are clean.

191
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,050
What have you got, then?

192
00:09:58,239 --> 00:09:59,159
He confessed.

193
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,440
He has been hiding in our family

194
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,750
for nearly two years

195
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:03,840
and he has only transmitted
one note recently.

196
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:06,400
What's on the note?

197
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,919
He has no idea

198
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:10,400
because he's only a messenger.

199
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,031
Looks like the spy
is indeed in this residence.

200
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,175
Very well.

201
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:19,200
We can take the chance

202
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,400
to clean out the servants.

203
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,359
I'll seriously interrogate

204
00:10:22,359 --> 00:10:23,919
all suspected servants.

205
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:26,159
The delivery address of that batch
was written in cipher.

206
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,359
Who wrote the ciphertext?

207
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,520
Mr. Zhao takes charge of ciphers.

208
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,320
There are different codebooks
for different batches.

209
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,175
The storage location
of this batch changed.

210
00:10:36,175 --> 00:10:37,919
So, the ciphertext changed, too.

211
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:39,440
I received the telegram.

212
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,825
After that,

213
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,640
I wrote the ciphertext on the paper.

214
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,690
After I decoded it,

215
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,906
I burned the paper.

216
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,525
Paper?

217
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,700
(Mark)

218
00:11:05,575 --> 00:11:06,975
(Mark)

219
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,225
It's a little trick.

220
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,679
We should figure out

221
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,200
who managed to sneak
into my father's private study

222
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,479
without leaving a trace.

223
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,500
It was negligent of me.

224
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,119
A spy from within
is hard to guard against.

225
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:32,000
Jiashang, be more careful, too.

226
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,790
As for Miss Feng,

227
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,729
let me say something unpleasant.

228
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,275
It's not that long ago
that you met her.

229
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,290
She's an outsider, after all.

230
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,050
Even if she doesn't mean to hurt you,

231
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,200
someone may use her

232
00:11:53,725 --> 00:11:54,646
to trap you.

233
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,579
She's just a woman.

234
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,200
But you adore her.

235
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,125
Then she's a weapon that can hurt you.

236
00:12:14,575 --> 00:12:16,850
No wonder girls like you, Xiucheng.

237
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,239
There's a reason for it.

238
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,044
How will you deal with Guo Dazhuang?

239
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,189
I'll make the best use of him

240
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,760
and see if I can track down

241
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,840
the man behind him.

242
00:12:29,175 --> 00:12:29,850
Mm.

243
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:31,700
Fine.

244
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,461
I'll take my leave, then.

245
00:12:32,725 --> 00:12:33,799
As for this report...

246
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,239
Give it to your father later.

247
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:36,960
All right.

248
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,450
See you.

249
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,175
(Foundling Home)

250
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,825
(Foundling Home)

251
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,725
(Foundling Home)

252
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:42,080
Boss,

253
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,159
something's wrong.

254
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,050
What's wrong?

255
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,570
The Foundling Home called,

256
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:46,960
saying that some strangers

257
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,440
followed Guo Dazhuang into the hall.

258
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:50,119
They seem to be sent by the Rong Family.

259
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,575
I'm afraid

260
00:13:56,575 --> 00:13:57,896
Guo Dazhuang's cover was blown.

261
00:13:58,679 --> 00:13:59,950
Will Miss Feng be in trouble?

262
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,200
Rong Jiashang

263
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,239
only tracked down to the Foundling Home.

264
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:05,280
It means

265
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,880
they only made Guo Dazhuang confess.

266
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:11,119
Guo Dazhuang and Feng Shizhen

267
00:14:11,119 --> 00:14:13,280
don't know each other's identities.

268
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,559
By now,

269
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,799
Shizhen is safe.

270
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:16,550
Then...

271
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:18,200
Do I need to sneak in
and check on her?

272
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,750
No.

273
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:22,945
Rong's Residence

274
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,080
must be heavily guarded.

275
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,600
If you sneak in,

276
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,999
you'll be caught.

277
00:14:28,425 --> 00:14:29,475
Instead of helping Shizhen,

278
00:14:29,475 --> 00:14:31,594
you'll only cause her trouble.

279
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,359
But I believe in one thing.

280
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,800
Shizhen...

281
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:36,280
I trained her myself.

282
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,000
I have confidence in her abilities.

283
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,599
You're right, Boss.

284
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,919
How do we deal with Guo Dazhuang?

285
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,080
It's dangerous

286
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,250
when Guo Dazhuang is
in the hand of Rong Jiashang.

287
00:14:49,175 --> 00:14:50,334
Try to get him out.

288
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,880
What about the Foundling Home?

289
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,960
Cut it off completely.

290
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,919
It can no longer be used.

291
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:57,559
Besides,

292
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,880
tell your men

293
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,679
to keep a close eye.

294
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:01,000
If anything happens,

295
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,919
let me know.

296
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,760
Yes.

297
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,525
Off you go.

298
00:15:18,904 --> 00:15:21,200
(Foundling Home)

299
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:27,450
Go check over there.

300
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,075
No one is in.

301
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:00,799
Miss Feng.

302
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,840
Did you have a good sleep last night?

303
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:07,520
Yes.

304
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,080
How's it going with Guo Dazhuang?

305
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,350
He was rescued.

306
00:16:38,425 --> 00:16:40,505
The man behind him is quite powerful.

307
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,475
How come?

308
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,425
Your men were following him,
weren't they?

309
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:47,625
Miss Feng,

310
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:49,496
think about it.

311
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,119
In such a big residence,

312
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,775
there are so many people.

313
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,650
But how many of them are honest?

314
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:00,575
Miss Feng,

315
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,119
do you trust me?

316
00:17:04,075 --> 00:17:04,996
I do, of course.

317
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,125
Then,

318
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,319
can I trust you?

319
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,520
What?

320
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,839
You don't trust me?

321
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,400
I do.

322
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,696
(Interrogation record)

323
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,719
We found out two servants
who stole things

324
00:17:40,719 --> 00:17:41,640
and they have been fired.

325
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:43,961
Most of the servants

326
00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:45,040
are clean,

327
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,280
except a gardener.

328
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,650
He confessed

329
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,560
that someone transmitted a message

330
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,160
through him.

331
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,550
Have you figured out the person?

332
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:53,910
Not yet.

333
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:57,119
They transmitted the message
through the locust tree in the garden

334
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:58,680
and they didn't see each other.

335
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,079
However,

336
00:18:02,775 --> 00:18:05,454
Miss Sun used to like reading
under the locust tree.

337
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
What about those people out there?

338
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,975
I sent Guo Dazhuang to contact them.

339
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,975
But he was rescued
from the Foundling Home.

340
00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:19,000
I checked the Foundling Home
with my men.

341
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,280
A foreigner runs it.

342
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,319
It's clean.

343
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:23,880
But its staff composition
is quite complicated.

344
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,280
So now,

345
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:27,079
we're not sure who is behind this.

346
00:18:28,215 --> 00:18:29,575
Someone from the Huang Family

347
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,479
works in the Foundling Home.

348
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,560
Have the servants replaced if necessary.

349
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,880
Keep a close eye on the Huang Family.

350
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:36,199
Once you find out anyone suspicious,

351
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:37,816
get him back.

352
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,400
Yes.

353
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,250
Things aren't going well
with Zhao, either.

354
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,920
He has been tracking down the goods.

355
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,975
Looks like

356
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,199
he can hardly get them back.

357
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,160
Can you think of any solutions?

358
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,129
I read the freight agreement

359
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:05,680
and did some checking.

360
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,720
I realize

361
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,920
that Commander Cao

362
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,640
pays special attention
to this batch of goods.

363
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:11,959
Besides,

364
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,319
the goods aren't delivered

365
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:16,040
to the European wharf
that we usually use.

366
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:19,225
Commander Cao and the European buyer
aren't trading silver coins,

367
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:21,260
but munitions.

368
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:22,950
So,

369
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,629
they pick a special wharf
for the delivery.

370
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:27,680
I see.

371
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,319
Any ideas?

372
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,600
I think

373
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,319
we can prepare equivalent munitions

374
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:36,479
as compensation.

375
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:38,725
Be specific.

376
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:39,800
I read about an item

377
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,701
in the agreement with Commander Cao.

378
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,040
If the deal fails

379
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,040
due to our fault,

380
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,520
we need to pay ten times for the loss.

381
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:51,560
Ten times the silver coins

382
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:53,160
or equivalent munitions.

383
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,175
Which do you think is better?

384
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:03,599
But at such a critical moment,

385
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,000
all forces are striving for munitions.

386
00:20:06,175 --> 00:20:08,750
Who can help with our emergency?

387
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,040
Where there's a will, there is a way.

388
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,959
The canteen I visited has great steak.

389
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:16,959
It does?

390
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:18,599
Shall I take you there
when there's a chance?

391
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:19,319
Good idea.

392
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,135
Long time no see.

393
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:30,890
All right.

394
00:20:39,475 --> 00:20:40,225
Yunchi.

395
00:20:40,225 --> 00:20:40,925
Mm?

396
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:42,959
I have something to tell you.

397
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:43,719
Come over.

398
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,600
All right.

399
00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:47,100
Excuse me.

400
00:20:47,475 --> 00:20:48,179
Mm.

401
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:55,479
Yunchi,

402
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,850
I know you're well-connected

403
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,275
and well-informed in Shanghai.

404
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,199
I'll count on you to take care of this.

405
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,079
Will you really listen to your father

406
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,425
and take care of the problem for him?

407
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,100
You always hate
such business, don't you?

408
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:10,000
He's my father, after all.

409
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,811
He supports the whole family.

410
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,520
I can be unruly.

411
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:16,195
I can be cynical, too.

412
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,425
But this is a different case.

413
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,775
I get it.

414
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:20,925
You can count on me.

415
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:30,520
Aunt.

416
00:21:34,225 --> 00:21:35,744
Aunt, have some tea.

417
00:21:36,475 --> 00:21:38,075
You still remember I'm your aunt?

418
00:21:39,025 --> 00:21:40,280
I took a trip to Hangzhou

419
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,300
and look what you've done at home.

420
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,750
You ransacked the whole residence.

421
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:46,025
No, no.

422
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:47,920
That was just a routine inspection

423
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,300
and the sticky-fingered servants
were replaced.

424
00:21:51,719 --> 00:21:52,520
Then why did you only replace

425
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,839
the servants from my maternal family?

426
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:55,625
Are you saying

427
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,545
that my servants are sticky-fingered?

428
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:58,525
Are you?

429
00:21:59,225 --> 00:21:59,975
Ah?

430
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,119
Here.

431
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,400
They confessed

432
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,079
and signed it.

433
00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:13,400
Look.

434
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:15,875
The assistant accountant

435
00:22:16,325 --> 00:22:18,725
embezzled over a hundred silver dollars.

436
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,880
This is the manager of the kitchen.

437
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,040
He embezzled the most money.

438
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,680
And this...

439
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,439
Look.

440
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,975
Your maid Ms. Liu.

441
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,680
She sold your pearl necklaces.

442
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,311
How ungrateful they are!

443
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,950
Most importantly,

444
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,631
Uncle is very upset.

445
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,239
He's upset?

446
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,719
Ask him to think about it.

447
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:53,000
Without my Huang family,

448
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,640
he wouldn't have been so rich!

449
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,680
He must be grateful.

450
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,479
It makes sense

451
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:00,640
even if he supports my family
all his life.

452
00:23:02,425 --> 00:23:03,905
That's not right, Ma'am.

453
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,199
Now that you're my father's wife,

454
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,079
you're one of the Rong Family.

455
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,641
You should give priority
to our benefits.

456
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:14,880
You can help your Huang family.

457
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,050
But you can't go too far.

458
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:18,439
Your family helped my father
build up the family fortune.

459
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,719
But we have never mistreated them.

460
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:23,280
The money we give them every year
can even afford an army.

461
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:26,079
Your brother was just so greedy.

462
00:23:26,199 --> 00:23:27,160
He has a no-show job,

463
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,925
but he still gets bribery.

464
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,375
Now, he's even involved in the spy case.

465
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,079
This spy

466
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,880
was recommended by your family.

467
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,425
Ma'am,

468
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:39,280
we support those who helped us,

469
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,000
but we never raise those
who betrayed us.

470
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,400
Wasn't that man recommended
by the Sun Family?

471
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,479
Why is it my family?

472
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:51,300
Ma'am, think twice before you talk.

473
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,880
Are you one of the Rong Family

474
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,400
or the Huang Family?

475
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,359
Who do you think you are?

476
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,000
You know what?

477
00:24:06,525 --> 00:24:08,359
You're just a jinx.

478
00:24:08,719 --> 00:24:10,100
A total jinx.

479
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,680
Because of you, your mother died.

480
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,119
Then, your little brother died.

481
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,041
Now you even want to hurt me?

482
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,959
I think

483
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,400
you'll also be betrayed

484
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,439
and end up all alone.

485
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,640
You'll die a terrible death.

486
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,959
Aunt, you're going too far.

487
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:27,199
Did I say anything wrong?

488
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,560
If it weren't for him,

489
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,520
my son...

490
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:30,680
He wouldn't have been kidnapped!

491
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,675
He wouldn't have been dead!

492
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,480
He left my son in danger!

493
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,479
To protect yourself,

494
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,439
you watched those men

495
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:43,119
kill your little brother.

496
00:24:45,439 --> 00:24:47,275
Look at you.

497
00:24:48,199 --> 00:24:49,599
You're just as heartless

498
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:51,000
as your father!

499
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,319
Aunt. Aunt. Aunt.

500
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:54,599
You never care for your family!

501
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:56,280
You care for no one, but yourself!

502
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:05,079
Ma'am, you're being too emotional.

503
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,680
I won't talk to you until you calm down.

504
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,199
Rong Jiashang!

505
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,591
Aunt... Aunt...

506
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,479
- Now, your father is still alive.
- Aunt. Aunt.

507
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:15,719
But you are already

508
00:25:15,719 --> 00:25:17,400
disrespecting your stepmother?

509
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,400
You're overthinking, Aunt.

510
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,599
When your father passes away,

511
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:21,479
will you kick me out immediately?

512
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:22,959
Aunt, he's leaving.

513
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:24,319
- You own me my son's life!
- Aunt.

514
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,239
Give my son back to me!

515
00:25:26,239 --> 00:25:28,520
Why do you think you can
swagger before me?

516
00:25:35,675 --> 00:25:38,040
How miserable I am!

517
00:25:39,925 --> 00:25:41,486
I have a husband.

518
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,950
But he's so ungrateful.

519
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:44,625
I had a son.

520
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,280
But...

521
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,825
But he died when he was so little.

522
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:37,625
What's wrong with Mr. Jiashang?

523
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:38,525
I don't know.

524
00:26:38,725 --> 00:26:39,660
I don't know.

525
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:51,050
- What do we do?
- Why is he so angry?

526
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,625
I hear Mr. Yang has come again.

527
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,000
He seems to have some questions for you.

528
00:26:58,725 --> 00:26:59,965
Do you

529
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,729
have something to tell Mr. Jiashang?

530
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,325
- No.
- No.

531
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,575
Get to your business, then.

532
00:27:04,575 --> 00:27:05,695
Miss Feng, excuse us.

533
00:27:05,695 --> 00:27:06,894
- Excuse us.
- Excuse us.

534
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,000
Jiashang,

535
00:27:22,199 --> 00:27:23,350
I don't want to disturb you.

536
00:27:24,479 --> 00:27:25,680
But if...

537
00:27:26,175 --> 00:27:27,616
If you want to talk to someone,

538
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,680
I'm right here.

539
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,079
Jiashang.

540
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,079
At least you didn't smash

541
00:28:07,439 --> 00:28:09,150
your model planes.

542
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:12,200
For her?

543
00:28:15,479 --> 00:28:16,625
It's not worth it.

544
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:19,250
Don't be angry.

545
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,680
I've brought you some biscuits.

546
00:28:21,925 --> 00:28:22,685
Have a taste.

547
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,275
I once read a medical journal.

548
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:35,479
It says

549
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:38,319
if a man has some sweet food
when he's angry,

550
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:40,275
he'll soon calm down.

551
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,239
I've never heard about it before.

552
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:47,920
Try one.

553
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,101
I didn't mean to quarrel with her.

554
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,839
She hates me.

555
00:29:13,199 --> 00:29:14,325
I complain about her.

556
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:17,350
All because of my brother's death.

557
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,000
But a dead man
can't come back to life.

558
00:29:23,439 --> 00:29:24,959
So, we can never be on good terms.

559
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,600
I know.

560
00:29:30,325 --> 00:29:32,839
Sometimes when you're angry,

561
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,199
you won't feel good
unless you give vent to your anger.

562
00:29:40,925 --> 00:29:42,600
You also quarrel with people?

563
00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:44,950
Of course.

564
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,920
After my family went broke,

565
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,439
we were often bullied.

566
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,359
I'm a woman

567
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,450
with old and sick parents.

568
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,479
If I were weak,

569
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:55,575
I would have been greatly bullied

570
00:29:55,575 --> 00:29:57,425
in such a cruel world.

571
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:03,500
I only witnessed
how you reasoned things out.

572
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,770
I can't imagine
what you look like in a quarrel.

573
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:11,119
Actually,

574
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:13,225
no one wants to quarrel.

575
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:17,445
Ma'am lives a hard life, too.

576
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:20,225
Her son died.

577
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,520
Her husband is cold to her.

578
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:26,479
She must be very lonely.

579
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:29,199
But she can't leave like Sun Shaoqing.

580
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:31,599
Others can break out of this place,

581
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:33,875
but she can't.

582
00:30:38,375 --> 00:30:39,750
She's kind of poor.

583
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,959
I understand.

584
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:51,319
I'll avoid arguing with her.

585
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,975
She...

586
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,250
She just doesn't understand you.

587
00:30:58,599 --> 00:30:59,900
In my eyes,

588
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,599
you're a loyal and righteous man.

589
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:03,520
You protect your family

590
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,680
and shelter them from trouble.

591
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,199
In the future,

592
00:31:08,439 --> 00:31:10,079
no matter who marries you,

593
00:31:10,825 --> 00:31:12,175
she'll live a happy life.

594
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:31,010
Ma'am,

595
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,280
what about Mr. Jiashang's
birthday party?

596
00:31:35,325 --> 00:31:36,825
Go tell Master

597
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,119
that I don't feel well.

598
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,439
I'm aching all over
and I can't think straight.

599
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,359
Don't bother me

600
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,599
unless you really have to.

601
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,899
But Master said

602
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,680
this is Mr. Jiashang's first time to

603
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,599
make an appearance in Shanghai
since he became an adult.

604
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,375
It has to be a grand party.

605
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:53,075
Ouch.

606
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,640
My head hurts.

607
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,119
I can't speak. I need to rest.

608
00:31:56,725 --> 00:31:57,575
Ouch.

609
00:31:58,525 --> 00:31:59,350
Ouch.

610
00:32:04,479 --> 00:32:05,160
Ma'am.

611
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:15,359
For Jiashang's birthday party,

612
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:17,400
Father will invite many guests.

613
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,839
How annoying!

614
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:20,959
I don't even have a nice new dress.

615
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:21,920
Fanglin,

616
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,319
you have a lot of dresses.

617
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:25,000
Why do you still complain?

618
00:32:26,001 --> 00:32:27,121
Look at my hairstyle.

619
00:32:27,121 --> 00:32:28,800
It's the most popular French wave.

620
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,725
It's modern, isn't it?

621
00:32:29,725 --> 00:32:30,250
Mm.

622
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,199
The dress bought last year

623
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,439
isn't good enough
for my new hairstyle.

624
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,800
As the saying goes,

625
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,239
a girl always

626
00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:38,675
needs a new dress. Right?

627
00:32:38,675 --> 00:32:39,675
- Miss Feng.
- Miss Feng.

628
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,600
Mother usually prepared

629
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,200
for such big parties in former years.

630
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,560
But now she's having a problem
with Jiashang.

631
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,239
These days, she's in bed,

632
00:32:48,239 --> 00:32:49,719
saying she's sick.

633
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,160
Do you think

634
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,079
the birthday party

635
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:53,400
will be canceled?

636
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,479
No way.

637
00:32:54,479 --> 00:32:56,479
It's Jiashang's 20th birthday party.

638
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,479
Fanglin,

639
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,439
Master may ask you

640
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:02,160
to hold the party, I guess.

641
00:33:02,175 --> 00:33:02,900
Ah?

642
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,819
Seriously?

643
00:33:04,175 --> 00:33:05,040
Miss Feng,

644
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,119
sorry to interrupt you.

645
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,280
Miss Fanglin,

646
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,760
Master just asked you

647
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,880
to take care of
Mr. Jiashang's birthday party

648
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,025
next month.

649
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,079
Me?

650
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,075
Miss Feng,

651
00:33:17,075 --> 00:33:18,874
you're quite prophetic.

652
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,839
It's a great chance
to exercise yourself.

653
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:21,800
Before,

654
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,359
you held some tea parties, didn't you?

655
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,079
At those tea parties,

656
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:27,479
we only invited a dozen classmates

657
00:33:27,479 --> 00:33:28,959
to have fun at home.

658
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:30,160
Yeah.

659
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,040
But this time,

660
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,359
Father will invite
all the important men in Shanghai.

661
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,239
There will be at least

662
00:33:36,719 --> 00:33:38,760
one or two hundred
Chinese and foreign guests.

663
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,000
Don't worry.

664
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,760
Ma'am will help you.

665
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,800
First, the residence should be cleaned.

666
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:49,359
Some of the furniture is broken

667
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:50,439
or has paint falling off.

668
00:33:50,479 --> 00:33:52,119
Replace some

669
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:53,599
and repaint some accordingly.

670
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:54,439
Got it?

671
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,680
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Yes, Ma'am.

672
00:33:57,719 --> 00:34:00,280
The garden in front of the residence
should be tended.

673
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,550
I won't let anyone

674
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:02,991
laugh at our family.

675
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:04,239
Get to your business. Go.

676
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,040
- Yes.
- Yes.

677
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,439
Ms. Kang, keep a close eye on them.

678
00:34:06,439 --> 00:34:07,560
Yes, Ma'am.

679
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,000
Be quick. Get going.

680
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,879
Thank you, Mother.

681
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:11,600
It's so nice to have you around.

682
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:13,080
Sure.

683
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,120
I'll certainly make you

684
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,919
the most graceful lady in Shanghai.

685
00:34:18,439 --> 00:34:19,360
By the way, Mother,

686
00:34:19,479 --> 00:34:21,919
I want Miss Feng to help me, too.

687
00:34:24,075 --> 00:34:24,700
Mm.

688
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,959
Miss Feng, you're very attentive.

689
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:29,634
Please help Fanglin

690
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:30,750
with the party.

691
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,360
I'll reward you.

692
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,159
Don't worry, Ma'am.

693
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,800
If Miss Fanglin needs any help,

694
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,239
I'll try my best.

695
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,250
- It counts on you.
- Mm.

696
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,560
You must do your best

697
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,439
and show your father
how capable you can be.

698
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,575
I know, Mother.

699
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,975
- I trust you.
- Mm.

700
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:54,425
Miss.

701
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,890
Miss, have some soup.

702
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
It's the snow clam and jujube soup

703
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,850
just delivered from Rong's Residence.

704
00:35:04,175 --> 00:35:06,400
Master still cares for you.

705
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:14,775
When Master favored me,

706
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:18,304
I had far better food than this.

707
00:35:20,275 --> 00:35:23,354
I risked my life
and gave birth to his son.

708
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,850
But I'm left alone in the hospital,

709
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,175
like a useless rag.

710
00:35:29,325 --> 00:35:30,750
How many times
has he come to the hospital?

711
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,100
Has he ever visited me?

712
00:35:35,919 --> 00:35:38,080
Master is just angry.

713
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,199
When you get better

714
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:42,000
and go back home with your son,

715
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:44,399
you'll have the final say.

716
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,750
After Shaoqing ran away from home,

717
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,639
things got tough

718
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:52,325
for our Sun family.

719
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,760
Do you really think
the big fool at the door

720
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,760
was sent by Master to protect us?

721
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,825
And Huang Shujun, the old hag.

722
00:36:03,399 --> 00:36:06,200
She won't let me override her again.

723
00:36:06,575 --> 00:36:08,256
I should be grateful that

724
00:36:08,256 --> 00:36:09,976
she didn't take the opportunity
to crash my family.

725
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:14,000
Come on in.

726
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,719
Dr. Feng.

727
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:28,879
Go tell your master

728
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,000
that in our hospital,

729
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,560
the adult and the baby are both lives

730
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:32,525
and they will both be protected.

731
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:35,900
Miss Sun,

732
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,100
how do you feel today?

733
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:38,810
Ah.

734
00:36:38,879 --> 00:36:39,840
Not bad.

735
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,320
Not bad.

736
00:36:44,475 --> 00:36:46,225
But you look pale.

737
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:48,625
Have a blood test later.

738
00:36:49,325 --> 00:36:50,560
If you feel anything wrong,

739
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,800
tell the nurse in time.

740
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:54,524
Thank you, Dr. Feng.

741
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,959
You're weak

742
00:36:59,959 --> 00:37:01,159
and you need extra nutrition.

743
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:02,320
The snow clam and jujube soup

744
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,239
is good for you.

745
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,320
Have it when it's hot.

746
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:05,900
Chuntao, give it to me.

747
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,625
Oh.

748
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,000
All right, then.

749
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,040
Take a good rest.

750
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,825
I'll leave you alone.

751
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,625
See you, Dr. Feng.

752
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:16,150
Mm.

753
00:37:20,575 --> 00:37:21,575
Miss,

754
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,050
why are you flushing?

755
00:37:25,225 --> 00:37:26,984
Are you feeling unwell?

756
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:28,199
Are you having a fever?

757
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:29,100
- No.
- Let me check.

758
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:30,610
No.

759
00:37:39,775 --> 00:37:41,015
Exotic beasts.

760
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,311
Antiques and paintings.

761
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,125
Rare medicinal materials.

762
00:37:45,275 --> 00:37:47,316
And munitions, of course.

763
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,850
They're all precious.

764
00:37:53,775 --> 00:37:55,250
Come on. Be careful.

765
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,330
It'll explode if it falls.

766
00:37:57,439 --> 00:37:58,679
Be very careful.

767
00:37:58,750 --> 00:37:59,631
Be careful.

768
00:38:02,439 --> 00:38:03,400
You made it?

769
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,280
Yes. I made it.

770
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,100
Look. Here are more things.

771
00:38:07,879 --> 00:38:09,350
The price is negotiable.

772
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,120
The quality isn't good.

773
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:12,900
Take it easy.

774
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:13,919
Let's keep looking.

775
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,075
Have another look.
Here are more things.

776
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:17,800
- Thank you.
- The price is negotiable.

777
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,679
Here are more things.

778
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:20,350
Come back later.

779
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,480
Come and have a look. Made in Germany.

780
00:38:39,825 --> 00:38:40,520
Boss,

781
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,679
they've been walking around for a while,

782
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:44,650
asking about munitions.

783
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,825
They're apparently rich young men
who haven't ever suffered.

784
00:38:49,025 --> 00:38:51,705
The industry of munitions
is so complicated.

785
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,800
They're too inexperienced.

786
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:56,600
This is a business coming to us.

787
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:58,390
Will we do it?

788
00:38:58,479 --> 00:38:59,850
Go talk to them.

789
00:39:16,399 --> 00:39:17,280
Hello, gentlemen.

790
00:39:17,475 --> 00:39:19,180
I hear you want some munitions.

791
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,760
Do you have the supply?

792
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,600
I certainly do.

793
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:25,000
But I wonder

794
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,879
if you can pay the price.

795
00:39:26,879 --> 00:39:27,775
Don't worry.

796
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,439
As long as you can provide
high-quality munitions,

797
00:39:29,439 --> 00:39:30,439
money isn't a problem.

798
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:35,900
Check this out.

799
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:41,700
Made in Germany?

800
00:39:41,919 --> 00:39:42,575
Right.

801
00:39:42,879 --> 00:39:43,919
We provide

802
00:39:43,919 --> 00:39:45,399
the best goods in Shanghai.

803
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:46,800
How many pieces do you have?

804
00:39:47,399 --> 00:39:48,800
You sound like

805
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,399
you want a big batch.

806
00:39:50,439 --> 00:39:51,439
Exactly.

807
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,879
But where did you

808
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:54,300
get the goods?

809
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,439
You don't need to know that.

810
00:39:56,439 --> 00:39:58,320
It's the rule of the black market.

811
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,350
You pay and we give you the goods.

812
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,719
When the deal is over,

813
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:03,000
we're done.

814
00:40:03,959 --> 00:40:06,360
If you have any concerns about it,

815
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,439
I can just

816
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:08,360
call the deal off.

817
00:40:08,919 --> 00:40:10,439
We're in an emergency, aren't we?

818
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:12,000
Where can we buy so many munitions?

819
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Don't be too cautious.

820
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,360
Or we'll miss the chance.

821
00:40:16,399 --> 00:40:17,439
What else do you have?

822
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:19,439
Small submachine gun and small grenades.

823
00:40:19,439 --> 00:40:20,239
We have all of them.

824
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,879
I want to check the goods first.

825
00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:25,280
How about this?

826
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:27,560
If you really want to buy some,

827
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,679
let's set a date.

828
00:40:28,879 --> 00:40:29,879
The night after tomorrow,

829
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,800
let's meet at the abandoned
No.11 Cargo Terminal.

830
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:33,080
What do you say?

831
00:40:36,439 --> 00:40:37,199
Deal.

832
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,600
Fine.

833
00:40:38,919 --> 00:40:40,000
See you there.

834
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,100
- Fanglin.
- Ah?

835
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,000
Come and have a look.

836
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:56,120
This is the guest list I've drafted.

837
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,200
Check it.

838
00:40:57,475 --> 00:40:58,150
Mm.

839
00:40:59,025 --> 00:41:01,760
I'll add some
of Father's business friends.

840
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,325
Mm.

841
00:41:02,325 --> 00:41:03,525
- Check it carefully.
- Mm.

842
00:41:04,675 --> 00:41:05,756
Look at this.

843
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:08,760
I'll check it out with Xiucheng.

844
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,950
If guests avoid some certain food,

845
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,100
write it down.

846
00:41:13,439 --> 00:41:15,399
Don't just stare at Xiucheng

847
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,919
and ignore what he says.

848
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,825
How annoying!

849
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,320
Don't say that. Don't.

850
00:41:22,725 --> 00:41:23,806
Miss Fanglin, Miss Fanghua,

851
00:41:23,925 --> 00:41:26,080
the hotel delivered many food samples.

852
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,350
Right out there.

853
00:41:28,225 --> 00:41:29,159
Let's go.

854
00:41:29,475 --> 00:41:30,825
- Miss Feng.
- Miss Feng, join us.

855
00:41:30,825 --> 00:41:31,560
All right.

856
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:32,475
Go.

857
00:41:45,625 --> 00:41:46,325
Mm.

858
00:41:46,325 --> 00:41:47,399
This tastes good.

859
00:41:47,399 --> 00:41:48,475
Add it to the food list.

860
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,150
Taste the red wine, please.

861
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:53,439
The red wine is perfect

862
00:41:53,439 --> 00:41:54,750
for grilled lamb chops.

863
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,625
Mm, I'll taste it later.

864
00:41:58,625 --> 00:41:59,525
Let me compare them.

865
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,215
Mm.

866
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,210
Miss Feng.

867
00:42:02,875 --> 00:42:04,250
Come and taste it.

868
00:42:04,675 --> 00:42:05,320
All right.

869
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,150
So many kinds of dessert.

870
00:42:11,525 --> 00:42:13,700
I haven't tasted this kind yet.
Try some for me.

871
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,181
How does it taste?

872
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:19,630
It tastes great.

873
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,600
This... This one tastes good, too.

874
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,250
Mm.

875
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:31,239
I'm sure

876
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:32,199
Fanghua will love it.

877
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:32,875
Mm.

878
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:35,080
Jiashang.

879
00:42:36,325 --> 00:42:37,075
Jiashang.

880
00:42:40,479 --> 00:42:41,750
Are you just back?

881
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:43,080
Yes.

882
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:44,560
What are you eating?

883
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,040
We're picking the dessert.

884
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:47,125
This one tastes great.

885
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:48,360
Try some.

886
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,900
