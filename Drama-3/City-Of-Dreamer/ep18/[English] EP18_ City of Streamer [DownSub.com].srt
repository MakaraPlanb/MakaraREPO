00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:34,500
=City of Streamer=

2
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,100
=Episode 18=

3
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,680
You kicked Qingzhi out of the house.

4
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,199
Wasn't it for the sake of Jiaxin,

5
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,120
I'd fallen out with you.

6
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:46,559
And what about now?

7
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,559
Are you destroying the Rongs' name?

8
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,839
I... I... I'm not.

9
00:01:50,839 --> 00:01:51,680
I... I...

10
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,919
Don't say one more word!

11
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:55,959
From now on,

12
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,625
we two families don't know each other!

13
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,520
Hi, Zhihui.

14
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,819
Mrs. Rong yelled at Mother

15
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,279
on the phone just now

16
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,750
and threatened to cut all ties with you.

17
00:02:28,119 --> 00:02:29,450
What were you thinking

18
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,200
seducing her husband?

19
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,839
Your aunt

20
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:36,119
is the only rich person we know.

21
00:02:36,279 --> 00:02:37,025
I meant to get a job

22
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:39,106
at her husband's company through her.

23
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,800
That's never going to happen now.

24
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,039
Look what you've done.

25
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,479
Who in their right mind

26
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,839
would marry a slut like you?

27
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,960
Don't listen to him, Zhihui.

28
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,279
I've checked with that loan shark.

29
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,440
That hillbilly

30
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,000
doesn't mind.

31
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:55,360
You can still be his wife.

32
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,399
I'm not going to marry him.

33
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,325
You...

34
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:14,919
Here's five thousand

35
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:16,559
to pay off your debts.

36
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,399
From now on,

37
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,980
we're even.

38
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,399
Zhihui,

39
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:28,425
Mr. Rong gave you

40
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,080
more than that, didn't he?

41
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,199
You're young and naive.

42
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,559
Men out there

43
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:36,960
are coveting your money.

44
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,199
Once they get it,

45
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:40,039
they'll go back to marry virgins.

46
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,591
It's not safe to keep such a fortune.

47
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,039
Let me handle it for you.

48
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,440
Yes. Give it to me.

49
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,440
I'll keep it for you

50
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,900
in case you get scammed.

51
00:03:54,325 --> 00:03:56,284
It's all I've got.

52
00:03:57,775 --> 00:03:59,334
Should I give it to you

53
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:01,919
or your wife?

54
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,240
Give it to me. I'm your elder brother.

55
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,240
Over my dead body!

56
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,360
You're a loser!

57
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,199
How much have we lost because of you?

58
00:04:09,275 --> 00:04:11,039
How dare you call me a loser!

59
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:11,919
I'm warning you!

60
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,000
I can kick you out!

61
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,759
Kick me out?

62
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:16,425
Sure, if you don't want your baby.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,040
Without me,

64
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,279
who'd cook for you

65
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,839
and look after your children?

66
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,359
I'm sick of you

67
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:24,079
gussying yourself up every day.

68
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,440
Who is it for?

69
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,839
What?

70
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,399
All I've had is the cheapest clothes
since we got married.

71
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,725
What could I do with them?

72
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,519
Say it!

73
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,000
Now, you're silent.

74
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,720
I should keep the money.

75
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:39,559
Give it to me!

76
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,720
It's too much

77
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,575
for a girl her age.

78
00:04:44,829 --> 00:04:48,700
(To Mother)

79
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,079
That girl is really something.

80
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:05,000
She's bold

81
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,079
and hard-hearted.

82
00:06:06,225 --> 00:06:07,705
After such a huge scandal,

83
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,399
even if it weren't her fault,

84
00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:11,200
it'd be impossible

85
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,215
to marry a decent man in the city.

86
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,440
The best option would be

87
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,959
to take shelter in another city

88
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:19,755
and marry a stranger quickly.

89
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:22,523
In terms of women,

90
00:06:22,523 --> 00:06:24,839
nothing is more important than

91
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,160
marrying a good man and having a son

92
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,350
when we're still young and pretty.

93
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,399
Things like ambition

94
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,200
and love

95
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:32,440
are young girls' privilege.

96
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,920
The older

97
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,079
and wrinklier we get,

98
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,359
the less

99
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:38,839
men care about us.

100
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:42,119
At the end of the day,
sons are our only hope,

101
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,440
don't you agree, Miss Feng?

102
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,375
You're young,

103
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,559
attractive

104
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:50,800
and well-respected

105
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,239
as a governess.

106
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,786
You have nothing to worry about,

107
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,440
especially

108
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,079
when your brother is unmarried himself.

109
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,950
Is Dr. Feng seeing anyone at the moment?

110
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,480
Not that I know of.

111
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:07,279
Nurses, patients and their family

112
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,559
at the hospital

113
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:10,040
all seem to like him, though.

114
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:12,239
He's always popular among girls.

115
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,559
So no worries there.

116
00:07:18,225 --> 00:07:19,925
Still, he needs to be careful

117
00:07:19,925 --> 00:07:21,440
so that he won't be fooled.

118
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,279
Miss Feng, you're unsophisticated.

119
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,475
Some women

120
00:07:25,475 --> 00:07:27,679
would do anything to get married.

121
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:28,320
They'd act all kind

122
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,440
and understanding before marriage.

123
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,559
After getting married,

124
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:33,679
they'd call their husbands useless

125
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,119
and unmarried sisters-in-law a burden

126
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:38,825
or not want to pay for their dowries.

127
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:42,359
Is that you, Concubine Sun?

128
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,959
I just heard Jiakang crying.

129
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,079
Go take care of your son.

130
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,679
Yes.

131
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:50,519
Ma'am.

132
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:51,525
Mm.

133
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:52,559
Miss Feng,

134
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,475
see you.

135
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:56,600
Sit back.

136
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:57,920
Thank you, Ma'am.

137
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,359
Clearly, she's Rong Dingkun's type.

138
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,365
Why would he rather take Yu Zhihui

139
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,600
than take a glance at Feng Shizhen?

140
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,250
Did he not make any move

141
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,079
because he already saw her

142
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,119
as his son's woman?

143
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:18,799
Ma'am.

144
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,275
I'd like to ask you something

145
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:25,959
You know what happened

146
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,320
at the party, don't you?

147
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:29,519
I can't say I don't.

148
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,799
Everyone is talking about it.

149
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:32,640
It's impossible

150
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,919
to shut them all up.

151
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:35,325
Is it true

152
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,039
that you were with Zhihui

153
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,640
the whole time

154
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,719
before that thing happened?

155
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,479
I was.

156
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,039
Miss Yu was drunk.

157
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,175
When I was about to go get Mr. Yang,

158
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,440
my brother said

159
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,760
he'd like to go home,

160
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,400
so I walked him out first.

161
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,375
Ma'am,

162
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,479
I'm to blame

163
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,520
for all that mess.

164
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,440
Had I...

165
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,599
It's not your fault.

166
00:09:00,175 --> 00:09:01,655
She chose that path.

167
00:09:03,575 --> 00:09:05,250
Are you leaving, Mr. Jiashang?

168
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:05,925
Yes.

169
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,440
Ma'am,

170
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,520
if there's nothing else,

171
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,760
I'm going upstairs.

172
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,719
Sure.

173
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,475
Mm.

174
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,119
Miss Feng...

175
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:59,459
(Shanghai-Nanjing)

176
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,799
Xiucheng,

177
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm not going to marry anyone else.

178
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,575
Let me go!

179
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,880
He's becoming more and more
like his father.

180
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:50,700
Morning, Miss Feng.

181
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,400
Morning, Mr. Jiashang.

182
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:55,960
I almost forgot Fanglin had gone out.

183
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,650
The class was canceled.

184
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,959
Wait!

185
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,575
We're still friends,

186
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,800
aren't we?

187
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,250
Are you interested in my calligraphy?

188
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:41,917
(Gentlemen)

189
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,950
It's got strength and style.

190
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,975
(Gentlemen should think...)

191
00:11:53,525 --> 00:11:54,975
I bet Meng Xu'an didn't get to

192
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:57,250
see Rong Jiashang's penmanship.

193
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,950
If he were that spoiled brat

194
00:12:01,525 --> 00:12:03,050
like everyone said,

195
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,080
he couldn't write so well.

196
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,225
(Gentlemen should think thoroughly.)

197
00:12:16,425 --> 00:12:17,264
You want to try it?

198
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:18,689
Why not?

199
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,900
(All rivers)

200
00:13:00,475 --> 00:13:02,150
(Gentlemen should think thoroughly.
All rivers run into the sea.)

201
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,359
That's unique.

202
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:14,100
You've got perseverance

203
00:13:14,675 --> 00:13:16,036
and talent.

204
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,351
If you were a man,

205
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,675
you'd make a difference.

206
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,361
I am what I am.

207
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,700
There are no ifs.

208
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,919
We'd better not

209
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,291
aim too high.

210
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,520
Live the life we have

211
00:13:34,775 --> 00:13:37,335
to the fullest is all that matters.

212
00:13:37,925 --> 00:13:40,406
If we can't even put food on the table,

213
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,120
the rest is just empty talk.

214
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,440
I hated it when you lectured me.

215
00:13:51,925 --> 00:13:53,000
But now that

216
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I can no longer hear you preaching,

217
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,750
I'll miss it.

218
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,920
You...

219
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:00,960
You aren't coming to class anymore?

220
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,640
My father asks me to
focus on our business.

221
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,719
So my study

222
00:14:07,275 --> 00:14:08,280
has to give way to that.

223
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,325
But that doesn't mean

224
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,524
I'll give up my dream.

225
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,840
That sextant you gave me

226
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:19,799
is sitting next to my model plane.

227
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,300
I can see it every day.

228
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,200
Good.

229
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,479
It pains me to see

230
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:28,359
a talented and ambitions young man

231
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,710
let go of his dream

232
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,381
for money.

233
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:34,975
You're born rich,

234
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:38,200
nothing should hold you back
from fighting for your dream.

235
00:14:40,975 --> 00:14:41,975
Shizhen,

236
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:47,025
have you ever been in love?

237
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,900
Of course.

238
00:14:55,925 --> 00:14:57,039
If not,

239
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:58,640
that wouldn't make sense

240
00:14:59,075 --> 00:15:00,356
at my age.

241
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,175
What kind of man was he?

242
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,080
Why should I tell you?

243
00:15:08,925 --> 00:15:10,764
We've found everything we can about you.

244
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,200
Nothing indicates

245
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,159
you've ever been involved with any man.

246
00:15:16,475 --> 00:15:18,725
Did you lie to me?

247
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,960
Why would I?

248
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,125
Besides,

249
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,550
you've never shared

250
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,025
your love life with me.

251
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,440
You mean Hashimoto?

252
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:33,650
Yeah.

253
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,359
That was a mistake years back.

254
00:15:41,075 --> 00:15:42,555
A mistake?

255
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,400
That's hurtful.

256
00:15:47,275 --> 00:15:48,520
I mean it.

257
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,875
Her mother was a retired harlot.

258
00:15:53,825 --> 00:15:55,146
When I first met her,

259
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,375
she was named after her

260
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:58,359
as Lin Shizhi.

261
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,760
All I know was

262
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,275
her mother was some rich man's mistress.

263
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:05,280
After that man's wife kicked her mother,

264
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,979
her brother and her out,

265
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,025
they had to depend on
their remote relatives in Chongqing.

266
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,700
So you stayed there

267
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,321
for another year for her?

268
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,559
Who told you that?

269
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,799
Fanglin and Fanghua.

270
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,880
According to them,

271
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,820
you two were childhood sweethearts

272
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,509
and forced to break up.

273
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,775
Now she's found you again,

274
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,475
but you've already been engaged.

275
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,320
How unfortunate

276
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,750
and sad your story is.

277
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,549
Those girls don't know anything.

278
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,909
Back then,

279
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,331
when Whampoa Military Academy

280
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,320
first opened to students,

281
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,025
I applied behind my father's back

282
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,575
and got admitted.

283
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:55,400
He wouldn't let me go

284
00:16:56,239 --> 00:16:57,650
and insisted I go to business school.

285
00:16:59,425 --> 00:17:00,640
So I refused to come back

286
00:17:00,925 --> 00:17:01,925
to protest against his decision.

287
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:03,425
Of course,

288
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,275
I didn't win.

289
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,920
In the end, I yielded to

290
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,875
his persuasion and pressure.

291
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:24,455
A plane has to

292
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,225
battle against gravity and the drag

293
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,325
to take off.

294
00:17:29,525 --> 00:17:32,125
If anything goes wrong,

295
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,225
it'll crash

296
00:17:34,725 --> 00:17:35,845
and kill everyone aboard.

297
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:38,560
Independence

298
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:40,479
is more complicated than you think.

299
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,571
I know.

300
00:17:44,275 --> 00:17:46,800
Sometimes, I think I've grown up.

301
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:49,599
At other times, however, I'm still young

302
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,990
and weak.

303
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,520
Growth takes time.

304
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,100
You know,

305
00:17:59,575 --> 00:18:01,160
I'm looking forward

306
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,920
to being flown by you

307
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,199
someday.

308
00:18:05,175 --> 00:18:05,875
Really?

309
00:18:06,225 --> 00:18:06,950
Yeah.

310
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,775
You want to be on my plane?

311
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,900
Of course,

312
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,280
if my student is a pilot.

313
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,475
It's not like

314
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,400
I can afford a ticket.

315
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:18,425
Deal!

316
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:20,025
Shizhen,

317
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,119
once I become

318
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:23,400
a pilot,

319
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,050
you'll be my first passenger.

320
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,000
Just because you no longer take my class

321
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,475
doesn't mean you can call me by my name.

322
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:34,875
You're cunning.

323
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:37,075
We were talking about your love life,

324
00:18:37,675 --> 00:18:39,716
yet you circled it back to me.

325
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:42,025
Oh?

326
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,160
I never meant to tell you anyway.

327
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,450
Are you going out?

328
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,800
Yeah. To run errands.

329
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,081
(Rong)
Mr. Yang isn't a nobody now.

330
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,920
How could he let it go

331
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,119
that his uncle took his woman?

332
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,000
I know, right?

333
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,679
He has to

334
00:19:12,925 --> 00:19:15,359
as long as he still wants his job.

335
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,839
I heard

336
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:18,959
Mr. Rong paid him a lot for this.

337
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,900
Money can't buy his dignity back.

338
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,640
Mr. Rong is his uncle

339
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,200
and boss.

340
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,079
He'll have to see him every day.

341
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,280
I feel bad for him!

342
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:30,225
Hey, would they

343
00:19:30,225 --> 00:19:32,050
fall out with each other?

344
00:19:32,825 --> 00:19:33,875
If you ask me,

345
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:34,800
I'd say yes.

346
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,425
He's here. Stop. Let's go.

347
00:19:37,675 --> 00:19:38,925
- Mr. Yang.
- Mr. Yang.

348
00:19:38,925 --> 00:19:41,119
Mr. Rong is waiting for you upstairs.

349
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:42,600
He wants to see you once you arrive.

350
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:50,640
They will be fine. He wouldn't dare.

351
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,425
Right?

352
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,199
I don't think so.

353
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,959
Enough.

354
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,121
Come in.

355
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,525
Xiucheng.

356
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:28,775
Have a seat.

357
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,760
I heard you were sick.

358
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,099
You look terrible.

359
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,100
I can get you a doctor.

360
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,575
It was just a cold

361
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:47,439
and could be contagious.

362
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,901
Thank you for your concern.

363
00:20:52,425 --> 00:20:53,050
I see.

364
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,880
Have a seat.

365
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,719
Xiucheng,

366
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,900
I know you're mad at me,

367
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,479
and you can't get it off your chest,

368
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:11,880
can you?

369
00:21:15,925 --> 00:21:17,560
I'm sorry

370
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,839
for putting you through all this.

371
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,150
I'm not just

372
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,050
your boss,

373
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,239
but also your uncle.

374
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,800
Although you're unrelated to me

375
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,000
but my wife,

376
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:36,520
I've been treating you as family,

377
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,760
cultivating and promoting you

378
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,079
over the past years.

379
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:42,625
Have I ever

380
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:44,880
mistreated you

381
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:47,264
prior to this incident?

382
00:21:51,719 --> 00:21:53,500
I'm forever in debt to you

383
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,475
for all that you've done for me.

384
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,920
I'm not asking you for any return.

385
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:01,920
I just want you to know

386
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,640
that you've come this far

387
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,925
because you deserve it.

388
00:22:08,199 --> 00:22:10,000
I don't want some stupid mistake

389
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,100
to drive a wedge between us.

390
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,680
You were there

391
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:25,959
when Yu Zhihui made a scene.

392
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:27,575
She wasn't innocent.

393
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:30,719
As you know,

394
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:31,880
I wouldn't

395
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,900
take women by force.

396
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:37,650
Well,

397
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:39,800
let bygones be bygones.

398
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,000
We should move on.

399
00:22:41,479 --> 00:22:43,119
That said,

400
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:44,760
I feel bad

401
00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:47,760
for what happened.

402
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:52,040
I understand

403
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,119
it's still awkward

404
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:54,280
for us to work together.

405
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,599
So,

406
00:22:58,925 --> 00:23:00,726
why don't you take a vacation

407
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,880
to relax yourself

408
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,219
and think about your future plan?

409
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,520
If you still want to work here,

410
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:09,640
as Manager Guo is about to retire

411
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,239
and Jiashang is still young,

412
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,239
you can be the General Manager.

413
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:16,600
If you have other plans,

414
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:21,175
we'll find a way to work things out.

415
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:29,275
I remember you said

416
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,600
that women are

417
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,119
unimportant.

418
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,400
I could never repay you for your help

419
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,280
and I'd never

420
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:40,920
betray you for such a trifle.

421
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:46,500
It's just that

422
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,520
we can't stop the staff

423
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:51,079
from gossiping around.

424
00:23:53,325 --> 00:23:55,164
I can come back once things blow over.

425
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:57,975
Sure.

426
00:23:58,719 --> 00:23:59,675
You may leave.

427
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,650
Xiucheng.

428
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:34,300
Father.

429
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,075
Mm.

430
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:40,839
What did you say to Yang Xiucheng?

431
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,800
I gave him a vacation.

432
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:46,319
This deal in Tianjin is well done.

433
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,191
It kept dragging on

434
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,319
until you made it work.

435
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,280
My friends are

436
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,725
speaking highly of you.

437
00:24:55,325 --> 00:24:57,846
Are you letting Yang Xiucheng go?

438
00:25:07,475 --> 00:25:08,520
Let me ask you.

439
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,560
If it were you,

440
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:12,000
what would you do?

441
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:13,239
I only work with

442
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,520
people I trust.

443
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,625
If you had little trust in him before,

444
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:19,119
now,

445
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,439
it's even less, isn't it?

446
00:25:23,425 --> 00:25:25,625
That ship has sailed.

447
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,319
Look,

448
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,079
learn from my mistake.

449
00:25:30,199 --> 00:25:32,199
Don't let any woman get in your way.

450
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:38,199
What about you and Miss Hashimoto?

451
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,599
I didn't know

452
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:42,199
she was your girlfriend.

453
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:44,175
She wasn't.

454
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,920
She was just a girl I met in Chongqing

455
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:47,760
who

456
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:51,280
you thought was too poor

457
00:25:51,479 --> 00:25:52,760
to be with me.

458
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,670
That was her?

459
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,010
So she's admitted by her family?

460
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,040
Why didn't you tell me

461
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,280
she's a Hashimoto?

462
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:02,599
If I had,

463
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:04,160
you would've had me

464
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:07,599
sign the prenup with her,

465
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,400
no?

466
00:26:12,525 --> 00:26:13,439
I know

467
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15,400
you hate me telling you what to do,

468
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,760
such as to marry Miss Du

469
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,079
and work in our company.

470
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,160
You don't want any of that.

471
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:21,520
But you're too young

472
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,880
to know what's best for yourself.

473
00:26:23,175 --> 00:26:24,400
Hadn't I intervened,

474
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,239
you would've still been wasting time

475
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:28,800
on your stupid dream.

476
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:30,280
Father,

477
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,839
a pilot is well-respected.

478
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,079
It's what I want to be.

479
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:37,750
How is that respectable?

480
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,920
It's the same as a driver.

481
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,839
Do you respect your driver?

482
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:45,200
All professions deserve

483
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:46,439
equal respect.

484
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,760
Father,

485
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,359
you're too conservative

486
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:50,359
and stubborn.

487
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,760
I know you wish to join the army

488
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,119
and prove yourself on the battlefield,

489
00:26:57,239 --> 00:26:59,560
but the military is divided.

490
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,760
Generals fight against each other

491
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,560
for money and fame

492
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,500
just like those in the outside world.

493
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:09,160
Back in the day, Hua'an and I

494
00:27:09,425 --> 00:27:11,624
went to deliver goods with guns

495
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:14,439
at the risk of our lives.

496
00:27:14,719 --> 00:27:16,719
We'd fight to the death

497
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:18,680
against robbers.

498
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,839
When our business expanded,

499
00:27:22,199 --> 00:27:23,520
we had to protect what we earned,

500
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,040
pay those along land and shipping routes

501
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:26,160
and take precautions against enemies.

502
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,560
We wouldn't go anywhere without guns.

503
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:28,479
Even at night,

504
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:30,100
we had to put them under the pillow.

505
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,075
After what I went through,

506
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:36,160
I'd never allow my son to follow suit.

507
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,880
Given our family condition,

508
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:40,425
you could enjoy a comfortable life

509
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,959
and go to college.

510
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,680
Why play with fire?

511
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:46,839
Now, back to business.

512
00:27:50,479 --> 00:27:51,625
You'll fill in for Xiucheng

513
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:55,050
while he's away.

514
00:27:55,959 --> 00:27:57,400
These are his files.

515
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,560
Read from cover to cover

516
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,160
to familiarize yourself with everything.

517
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:02,839
Is that all?

518
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:04,280
I'm off.

519
00:28:05,325 --> 00:28:06,050
Hey...

520
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,525
(Wenchunli Title Deed)

521
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,575
(Seller: Shanghai Dasheng Company
Buyer: Shanghai Rong Company)

522
00:28:51,975 --> 00:28:53,254
Miss Feng,

523
00:28:54,025 --> 00:28:55,065
I was told

524
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:59,160
your family once owned
a pharmacy at Wenchunli

525
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,600
which was later destroyed in a fire.

526
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:03,640
My family and I survived

527
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,800
except that my father got injured.

528
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:07,725
Well, a full recovery can be expected.

529
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,400
Secretary Zhao,

530
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:20,599
come to my office now.

531
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:29,755
Come in.

532
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,479
Mr. Jiashang,

533
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:36,520
what do you need?

534
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,574
I'm asked to
take over Mr. Yang's projects

535
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,759
and I have questions

536
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,275
regarding things in his files.

537
00:29:44,475 --> 00:29:45,975
You've been with him for so long.

538
00:29:46,425 --> 00:29:47,760
What do you know

539
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,720
about the Wenchunli Project?

540
00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:51,199
Mr. Yang

541
00:29:51,199 --> 00:29:52,800
was in charge of it.

542
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:57,359
Dasheng sold that large piece of land

543
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,425
to us

544
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,325
at an unusually low price.

545
00:30:02,925 --> 00:30:04,025
Why was that?

546
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:08,560
Mr. Rong had his eyes

547
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,640
on that land long ago.

548
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:12,800
Mr. Yang and I went to negotiate

549
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,599
with shop owners
and residents there many times

550
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:16,959
but couldn't reach an agreement

551
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:18,000
as they all had their own demands.

552
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:18,839
Hearing that Mr. Yang failed,

553
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:20,439
Mr. Rong gave him a tongue-lashing.

554
00:30:20,959 --> 00:30:23,119
Unexpectedly, that place

555
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:24,439
got burned down overnight

556
00:30:24,439 --> 00:30:25,680
and became worthless later.

557
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:28,199
Dasheng took the chance

558
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:29,800
and got hold of it.

559
00:30:30,275 --> 00:30:32,599
As for why they didn't charge us

560
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:34,040
for more,

561
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,800
I have no idea.

562
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,959
Mr. Yang handled

563
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:40,239
the transaction himself.

564
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:43,049
That didn't make sense.

565
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,630
If we wanted that land for so long,

566
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,680
how come veterans like
my father and Yang Xiucheng

567
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,040
didn't make any move

568
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,175
when its price plummeted

569
00:30:51,675 --> 00:30:53,675
and let Dasheng get it?

570
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:56,359
And I'm not seeing anything

571
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:59,000
about that company in the files.

572
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:00,486
I know.

573
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,275
Mr. Jiashang,

574
00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:03,640
the thing is,

575
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:05,400
Mr. Yang finished this project

576
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,599
all by himself

577
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,439
after the fire.

578
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,560
He only gave me paperwork.

579
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,680
I don't know anything

580
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,239
about Dasheng.

581
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,280
I see.

582
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,800
You may leave.

583
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:18,800
Yes.

584
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,625
One more thing.

585
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:25,119
I need newspapers

586
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:26,719
and anything you can find

587
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:28,239
about the Wenchunli Fire.

588
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,359
Yes.

589
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:42,000
(Shanghai Station)

590
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,300
(Shanghai-Hangzhou)

591
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,250
(Shanghai Station)

592
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,025
Occupied.

593
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,081
I know.

594
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:18,925
What are you doing here?

595
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,079
I'm invited to a schoolmate's wedding
in Hangzhou.

596
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,040
I spotted you all depressed

597
00:32:24,225 --> 00:32:26,105
and came to say hi.

598
00:32:28,225 --> 00:32:29,625
Pull yourself together.

599
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,160
She cheated on you, so what?

600
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,199
Didn't you already know

601
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,760
what kind of woman she was?

602
00:32:38,439 --> 00:32:39,439
Leave me alone.

603
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,049
That's none of your business.

604
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,671
Like I care about you.

605
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,260
You're incorrigible.

606
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,880
You could've been a boss,

607
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:51,880
but you went to be Rong Dingkun's slave,

608
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:55,164
and let Rong Jiashang reap

609
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:57,095
you've sowed all these years.

610
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,325
What's worse,

611
00:32:59,719 --> 00:33:01,680
you know Rong Dingkun's secrets.

612
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:03,244
I don't need to tell you

613
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,959
how he ties up loose ends.

614
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,000
What do you think will happen to you?

615
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,560
Drowned in the water,

616
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:14,750
or buried in the wild?

617
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,825
You don't have family anyway.

618
00:33:20,525 --> 00:33:22,126
No one

619
00:33:22,239 --> 00:33:24,040
will even go to your tomb.

620
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:31,040
You're too soft.

621
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,725
If you want to rise to the top,

622
00:33:33,725 --> 00:33:35,375
you should do everything to win.

623
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:39,640
Had you dumped Yu Zhihui

624
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,560
to be with Rong Fanglin,

625
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,880
you would've got your share
of the Rongs' property.

626
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,800
And what did you do?

627
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,280
You stayed faithful

628
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,959
only to be played by Yu Zhihui.

629
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:59,359
Miss Du,

630
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,160
if you're here to taunt me,

631
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,160
that's enough.

632
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:15,425
Please go back to your compartment.

633
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:20,450
I'm here to wake you up.

634
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:26,225
Yang Xiucheng,

635
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,159
I believe

636
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,719
a man with your talent and experience

637
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,750
deserves

638
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,439
a better boss

639
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,375
and a better woman.

640
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,399
If you still don't realize that

641
00:34:39,425 --> 00:34:42,000
and don't know what you want,

642
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:45,824
then you're the dumbest

643
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,800
and cheapest clown in the world.

644
00:35:16,925 --> 00:35:33,162
(Fire Broke out at Wenchunli)

645
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,125
- Mr. Jiashang.
- Mr. Jiashang.

646
00:36:08,925 --> 00:36:09,775
Sir.

647
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:11,289
To Wenchunli.

648
00:36:11,575 --> 00:36:15,250
(Rong)

649
00:36:58,875 --> 00:36:59,500
Here.

650
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:01,879
What's this about?

651
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:04,679
Hey,

652
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,100
are you aware

653
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,200
of the Wenchunli Fire last year?

654
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,075
Of course.

655
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,800
Those flames

656
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,520
lit up the entire city.

657
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,360
Our newspaper broke the story first.

658
00:37:17,775 --> 00:37:18,959
Didn't that piece of land

659
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:21,199
end up in your hands?

660
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,919
After the fire,

661
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,000
Dasheng Company

662
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,560
bought it

663
00:37:30,479 --> 00:37:32,600
and then sacrificed it to us

664
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,320
in a financial strait.

665
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,439
You have all kinds of connections.

666
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:39,975
I need you

667
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:41,560
to look into that company.

668
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,600
Why don't you

669
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,000
ask your father about it?

670
00:37:45,761 --> 00:37:47,560
He traded with them

671
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,325
and must know a thing or two.

672
00:37:50,919 --> 00:37:51,800
Yunchi,

673
00:37:52,919 --> 00:37:53,959
honestly,

674
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:56,199
I think that fire

675
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,361
wasn't an accident.

676
00:37:59,879 --> 00:38:00,959
What do you mean?

677
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:04,239
I believe

678
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,900
someone set that place on fire

679
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,399
to get the land at the cheapest price.

680
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:10,120
My family

681
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,975
could be behind it.

682
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:16,919
I need to know the truth.

683
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:19,600
Yunchi,

684
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,775
please do me this favor.

685
00:38:34,959 --> 00:38:36,050
Finally!

686
00:38:40,575 --> 00:38:41,439
How rude!

687
00:38:45,479 --> 00:38:48,040
We're going to the Rong's
with Father tonight.

688
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,399
How are you going to
impress them like this?

689
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:52,575
No worries.

690
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:54,080
Brother can't leave the house.

691
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,399
I'm the only son left.

692
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,239
If the Rongs intend to work with us,

693
00:38:57,399 --> 00:38:58,840
I'm their only option.

694
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,800
You fool!

695
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,560
We're siblings

696
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,639
and twins.

697
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:09,159
If you show up as a good-for-nothing,

698
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,320
what will they think of me?

699
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:13,040
By "they", do you mean your ex?

700
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,239
You want him back, don't you?

701
00:39:14,525 --> 00:39:16,550
If it's yours, it's yours.

702
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,600
If it's not, it's not.

703
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,850
It has nothing to do with me.

704
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:21,025
When Father

705
00:39:21,399 --> 00:39:22,600
had us back

706
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,280
as his children,

707
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,840
you thought Jiashang was too poor

708
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,320
for our family.

709
00:39:29,879 --> 00:39:30,850
Then what?

710
00:39:33,125 --> 00:39:34,045
Turns out

711
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,120
he's Rong Dingkun's eldest son,

712
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,120
the first heir to their family business.

713
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,875
If you and Mother hadn't interfered,

714
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:46,080
we would've got married long ago.

715
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:48,475
Come on!

716
00:39:48,475 --> 00:39:50,100
Don't blame us.

717
00:39:50,399 --> 00:39:52,175
Who dumped him

718
00:39:52,175 --> 00:39:53,639
for him lacking money?

719
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,439
It wasn't us.

720
00:39:56,959 --> 00:39:58,040
Too bad,

721
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,375
he's already engaged.

722
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,239
But you can

723
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:04,639
still be his concubine.

724
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,959
Be his concubine?

725
00:40:07,479 --> 00:40:08,679
No way!

726
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,360
You forgot how Mother had to

727
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,199
grovel to Father's wife

728
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,719
like a slave

729
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:19,600
with no dignity and died in depression.

730
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,225
You forgot how others looked at us

731
00:40:22,225 --> 00:40:24,239
and humiliated us?

732
00:40:27,399 --> 00:40:29,479
Father wouldn't have gotten us back

733
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,875
if Brother had been healthy.

734
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:36,300
I cannot live like Mother.

735
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:42,239
I'll marry Rong Jiashang

736
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,700
as his wife

737
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:48,120
and take over

738
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:50,575
his entire family.

739
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,201
He's taken.

740
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,800
What else can you do?

741
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,399
Jiashang is soft-hearted.

742
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,600
We had a history after all.

743
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,000
Now,

744
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,250
if playing well,

745
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,825
I can use that to my advantage.

746
00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:20,479
Mr. Jiashang,

747
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:21,679
did you just come back?

748
00:41:21,975 --> 00:41:22,675
Yes.

749
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,760
Is Miss Feng in?

750
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,000
Sorry, Mr. Jiashang.

751
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,800
Mrs. Rong gave her permission

752
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,719
to go home for the festival.

753
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:30,520
She'll be back in the evening.

754
00:41:31,439 --> 00:41:32,175
I see.

755
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,141
Mr. Jiashang.

756
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,800
Who is that, Mother?

757
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,175
It doesn't ring a bell.

758
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,250
Mrs. Zhao's niece.

759
00:41:55,825 --> 00:41:57,439
You went to the same school.

760
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,239
It's her!

761
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:01,239
Now, I remember.

762
00:42:01,439 --> 00:42:03,350
Mrs. Zhao has asked me a few times,

763
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:05,560
but Shixun doesn't cooperate.

764
00:42:06,925 --> 00:42:07,750
At this rate,

765
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,679
when will I have grandchildren?

766
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,479
Mother!

767
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:14,750
Here we go!

768
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,000
Again with the grandchildren.

769
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,360
I'm on Mother's side.

770
00:42:18,439 --> 00:42:20,300
When will I have a sister-in-law?

771
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:24,439
Just worry about yourself.

772
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,840
Mother is working on your marriage, too.

773
00:42:28,439 --> 00:42:29,650
You're older and unmarried.

774
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:30,691
It's not my turn yet.

775
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:33,239
You're wrong.

776
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:34,840
You're 23 already.

777
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,719
Wait any longer,

778
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:37,479
and you'll end up

779
00:42:37,479 --> 00:42:39,199
as someone's stepmother.

780
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:40,000
Mother,

781
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,239
there's still time.

782
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,120
Relax, Mother.

783
00:42:43,225 --> 00:42:44,040
She's my sister.

784
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,550
If she decides to remain single,

785
00:42:45,879 --> 00:42:47,120
I'll support her forever.

786
00:42:47,959 --> 00:42:48,850
Poppycock!

787
00:42:52,075 --> 00:42:52,950
Shixun.

788
00:42:52,954 --> 00:42:53,479
Yes?

789
00:42:53,479 --> 00:42:54,919
Is this a new scarf?
