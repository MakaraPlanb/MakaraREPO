00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,080
Rong Dingkun,

4
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,000
you old fool!

5
00:01:48,825 --> 00:01:50,500
Someday,

6
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,201
you'll be buried by women!

7
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,519
Miss!

8
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,199
Are you alright?

9
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,175
My stomach!

10
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,319
Lie down.

11
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:06,599
Blood!

12
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,600
You're bleeding, Miss!

13
00:02:09,425 --> 00:02:10,100
- Go!
- Miss!

14
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,825
Doctor!

15
00:02:10,825 --> 00:02:11,500
Let's go!

16
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,559
- Doctor!
- Help!

17
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:13,600
Doctor!

18
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,150
You'll be fine, Miss.

19
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,479
- Doctor!
- Doctor,

20
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,950
please save my baby!

21
00:02:18,589 --> 00:02:19,550
Or I'll die

22
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,720
with him!

23
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,479
Dr. Feng,

24
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,119
we couldn't reach Dr. Zhao
to deliver the baby.

25
00:02:23,119 --> 00:02:23,639
Miss!

26
00:02:24,725 --> 00:02:25,360
Miss!

27
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,650
Go to the OR. I'll do it.

28
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,475
- Yes.
- Wait!

29
00:02:27,635 --> 00:02:28,320
Can you do it?

30
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,350
Listen,

31
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:30,841
this isn't anyone's baby.

32
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:32,160
Can you take the consequences?

33
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,639
If you're so worried about the baby,

34
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:35,100
why hit his mother?

35
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,080
Whether she lives or dies,

36
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:38,360
the baby must be alive!

37
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,240
They're equally important

38
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,825
and we'll do everything we can

39
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,475
to save them!

40
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,225
You...!

41
00:02:43,225 --> 00:02:44,140
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

42
00:02:45,075 --> 00:02:46,000
Careful!

43
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,200
Come on.

44
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,639
(OR)

45
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,160
Hang in there, Miss!

46
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,175
(Surgery in Progress)

47
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,850
They'll be fine.

48
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:12,657
(Quiet Please)

49
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,349
Doctor...

50
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,760
Doctor,

51
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:27,800
is it a boy?

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,759
Is it?

53
00:03:47,575 --> 00:03:48,421
I see.

54
00:03:48,725 --> 00:03:49,546
Got it.

55
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,679
How did it go?

56
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:52,550
Is the baby out?

57
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:53,775
Yes,

58
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,415
Ma'am.

59
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,425
Is it a boy or a girl?

60
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,244
A baby boy.

61
00:04:08,675 --> 00:04:10,315
I have a son!

62
00:04:10,725 --> 00:04:12,684
A baby boy!

63
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,529
Huang Shujun,

64
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,350
it's a boy!

65
00:04:20,775 --> 00:04:22,550
Rong Dingkun,

66
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:27,400
we have a son!

67
00:04:38,975 --> 00:04:40,095
But the doctor says

68
00:04:40,095 --> 00:04:41,485
he's premature

69
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,561
and quite weak.

70
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,359
Now, he's in the incubator.

71
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,000
We should be prepared for his condition.

72
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,760
Go wake Dingkun up.

73
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:01,000
Tell him

74
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:03,425
he's having another son.

75
00:05:03,725 --> 00:05:04,764
Yes, Ma'am.

76
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,500
(Resignation)

77
00:05:19,325 --> 00:05:21,775
I'm turning in my resignation.

78
00:05:23,075 --> 00:05:24,235
You've only been here for two weeks.

79
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,260
According to the contract,

80
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,064
I can only give you five yuan.

81
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,720
I apologize for the inconvenience.

82
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,841
Like that would make my job easier.

83
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:33,799
How am I supposed to

84
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,519
find a replacement in such little time?

85
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:38,725
Again, sorry.

86
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:09,450
Shixun!

87
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,480
You were on the night shift again?

88
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,530
I pulled an all-nighter in surgery.

89
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,160
Go nap inside next time,

90
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,200
or you'll catch a cold.

91
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,000
I will.

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,640
Don't worry.

93
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,440
I got paid!

94
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,160
How about breakfast

95
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,350
at Guangzhou Guild Hall? My treat.

96
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:29,175
Sounds good.

97
00:06:30,275 --> 00:06:30,930
By the way,

98
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:32,200
I delivered

99
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,600
a premature baby at dawn

100
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,200
whose mother is Mr. Rong's concubine.

101
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,450
She gave birth

102
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,529
to a son early this morning.

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That family

104
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,519
is full of drama.

105
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:45,800
Hey,

106
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,160
was it she

107
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,920
who had a problem with you?

108
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,480
No.

109
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,725
Her new-born son

110
00:06:53,725 --> 00:06:55,079
will give her more leverage

111
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,239
in the house.

112
00:06:57,119 --> 00:06:58,000
Shizhen,

113
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,075
I don't think you should go back

114
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,679
to work for them.

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,800
Shixun,

116
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,775
I'm just a teacher.

117
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,320
I'll be fine.

118
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,399
Yeah.

119
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,079
You're right.

120
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:12,725
I don't know why I said that.

121
00:07:13,925 --> 00:07:15,079
I'm sure you know

122
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,399
what you're doing.

123
00:07:16,775 --> 00:07:17,975
Yes. Don't worry.

124
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,040
Alright. Give me a minute.

125
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,239
I'll go get changed.

126
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,359
Then we can have dim sum.

127
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,200
Yeah, dim sum!

128
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,839
Be quick.

129
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,400
I will.

130
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,600
- Shixun.
- Yes?

131
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,040
How about that new dim sum place?

132
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,279
Sure. We can have

133
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,239
whatever you like.

134
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:37,160
Thanks.

135
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,959
Mr. Rong.

136
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:42,119
Mrs. Rong.

137
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:43,400
Miss Feng,

138
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,000
what brings you here?

139
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:47,079
I've just quit my job at the hospital.

140
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:49,800
This is my elder brother.

141
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,650
Master,

142
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,450
Ma'am,

143
00:07:53,575 --> 00:07:55,376
he's Concubine Sun's doctor.

144
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,320
Thank you for delivering her of a boy.

145
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,079
Our whole family is in debt to you.

146
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,200
Give him that.

147
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,025
Uh...

148
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,600
Just a little something,

149
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:12,769
Dr. Feng.

150
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:15,880
I came in haste.

151
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,959
I'll thank you properly later.

152
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,559
- Miss Feng, when will you come back?
- Miss Feng, when can you be with us?

153
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:28,839
We miss you a lot!

154
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,320
They've accepted my resignation.

155
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,450
You'll see me at home soon.

156
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,039
Great.

157
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,918
You're a good teacher and funny.

158
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:35,039
We like you.

159
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,559
Fanghua.

160
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:40,000
Go ahead.

161
00:08:40,575 --> 00:08:41,225
I'll see you around.

162
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:42,239
- See you.
- See you soon.

163
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:42,850
Go.

164
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:48,520
Now, I see

165
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,550
why you want to go back to teach.

166
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,640
Those two girls

167
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,550
are your fans.

168
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,239
They're smart and diligent.

169
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,840
It's a rewarding job

170
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,250
helping them

171
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,730
with what I know.

172
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:04,119
They're all here to see that baby boy

173
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,359
except for the elder heir.

174
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,119
It's very generous of them.

175
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:13,719
This is almost

176
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,344
as much as my annual salary.

177
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:19,280
Mrs. Rong can

178
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,280
gamble away it easily.

179
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,000
Just take it.

180
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,325
It's a thank-you gift.

181
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,500
Alright.

182
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,700
Let's go.

183
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,640
Dim sum it is.

184
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,239
Yes!

185
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,075
Miss Feng.

186
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:07,719
I didn't know you'd come,

187
00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:09,119
or I would've picked you up.

188
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,679
My new place

189
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,200
has a bus to this street.

190
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,559
No need to trouble you.

191
00:10:13,675 --> 00:10:14,994
No trouble at all.

192
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:27,080
I was surprised
that you answered the door. Why?

193
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,480
They're all out.

194
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,159
Mrs. Rong and Concubine Wang
are at Lingyin Temple in Hangzhou.

195
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,520
My father seldom comes home these days.

196
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,159
We can enjoy

197
00:10:37,575 --> 00:10:39,550
peace for a long while.

198
00:10:44,325 --> 00:10:45,000
Thanks.

199
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,136
Try this.

200
00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:53,080
Thank you.

201
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,075
Miss Feng,

202
00:10:54,075 --> 00:10:55,320
the first time we met,

203
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,679
I found you so relatable

204
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:58,175
like my elder sister.

205
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,100
Me too.

206
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,080
I was fed up with Miss Gao.

207
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,599
She couldn't answer our questions

208
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:04,479
and blamed us for asking them.

209
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,239
Yes.

210
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:07,520
Finally, Jiashang's done something nice

211
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
by getting you back.

212
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,880
Knock it off, girls.

213
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,559
I'll check your homework later

214
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,919
and see if you slacked off

215
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,075
while I was away.

216
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,679
Oh, no, please!

217
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,400
We're always hardworking.

218
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,650
That's true.

219
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,359
We've been studying

220
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:26,599
ten new words every day

221
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:28,400
like you asked.

222
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,239
Unlike us,

223
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:31,320
Jiashang has

224
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,799
practically given up since you left.

225
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,320
Then he'll have to do test papers.

226
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,800
Yes, Miss Feng.

227
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:43,200
Whatever you say.

228
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,039
Morning, Miss Feng.

229
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:57,700
Good morning.

230
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,799
Miss Feng,

231
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,625
I'm turning 20

232
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,239
on the 9th next month.

233
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,119
There will be a ball.

234
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,840
Will you come?

235
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,559
It's your big day.

236
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,359
How could I miss it?

237
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:14,825
It's just that

238
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,000
I can't afford a proper gift.

239
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,520
Just bring yourself there.

240
00:12:20,775 --> 00:12:21,425
No problem.

241
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:23,359
Now, can we begin today's lesson?

242
00:12:23,475 --> 00:12:24,150
Sure.

243
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,799
Let's pick up where we left off...

244
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:30,811
Passive voice.

245
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,520
Excuse me.

246
00:12:34,675 --> 00:12:35,425
Sorry to interrupt.

247
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:39,725
I'll leave you two alone.

248
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,280
Wait, Miss Feng.

249
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,640
I'm here

250
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,760
for you, too.

251
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,175
What's up?

252
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,400
It's about the previous leak.

253
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:53,320
Mr. Zhao's men have been checked out.

254
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,350
They're all clean.

255
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:55,880
What's left

256
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,400
is people in this house.

257
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,990
Uncle will be back later.

258
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,359
He asked us

259
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,200
to vet everyone first.

260
00:13:02,475 --> 00:13:03,320
Is that so?

261
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,080
Yes.

262
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,280
It's much easier

263
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:08,725
whilst Aunt is away.

264
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,840
Were she here,

265
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,520
she'd have another heart attack.

266
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,760
I'm just doing what Uncle says.

267
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,039
Miss Feng,

268
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,119
I'm afraid you'll have to

269
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:22,599
answer a few questions, too.

270
00:13:23,825 --> 00:13:24,945
Me?

271
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,400
Leave her out of it.

272
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,200
What else is there

273
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,679
that we don't know about her?

274
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,640
Certain details about the night

275
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:36,025
Sun Shaoqing escaped remain unclear.

276
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,599
You can ask me.

277
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,599
I was drunk that night

278
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,840
and tried to pull a stunt on her

279
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,200
only to get slapped in the backyard.

280
00:13:42,359 --> 00:13:44,000
Almost everyone in the house saw it.

281
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:45,640
Jiashang...

282
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,080
Miss Feng,

283
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,559
you shouldn't be interrogated.

284
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,125
It's not an interrogation,

285
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,320
but an inquiry.

286
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,919
She'll be fine

287
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,599
if she's not involved.

288
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,239
I thought she had been ruled out.

289
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,440
Well,

290
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,520
new leads have turned up.

291
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,159
Maybe Miss Feng can be of help.

292
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,400
Xiucheng,

293
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,039
you heard me.

294
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:14,520
It's fine.

295
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,520
Mr. Yang,

296
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,880
I'll cooperate.

297
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,799
Relax, Miss Feng.

298
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,719
Uncle got this machine from the British

299
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:33,280
for polygraph tests

300
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:35,719
based on people's pulse and heartbeat.

301
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:38,320
You'll be safe.

302
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:41,975
Miss Feng,

303
00:14:41,975 --> 00:14:43,054
you don't have to do this.

304
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,080
We can stop it anytime

305
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,000
if you feel uncomfortable.

306
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:46,599
I can do it, Jiashang.

307
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,320
Jiashang,

308
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,640
Uncle wants

309
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,960
everyone in this house

310
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,150
to get tested.

311
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,679
Miss Feng is only the first one.

312
00:14:58,799 --> 00:14:59,880
Whatever.

313
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:01,550
Just do it.

314
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:07,239
What's your name?

315
00:15:07,725 --> 00:15:08,550
What?

316
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,844
Your name, please.

317
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,799
Feng Shizhen.

318
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,080
Age.

319
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,200
23.

320
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,799
Members of your family.

321
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:23,318
My parents and elder brother.

322
00:15:23,318 --> 00:15:24,525
(Inquiry Record)

323
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,599
Did someone send you

324
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,760
to the Rong's?

325
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,960
No.

326
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,200
I came because I needed a job.

327
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:33,960
Did you

328
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,119
leak information to others?

329
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,159
No.

330
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,239
Did you say anything to your family?

331
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:41,359
No.

332
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,359
I'm here to get paid.

333
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,599
Gossiping around would do me no good.

334
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,880
Miss Feng,

335
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,520
did you ever encourage

336
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,159
Sun Shaoqing to escape?

337
00:15:58,919 --> 00:15:59,760
Yes.

338
00:16:08,025 --> 00:16:09,585
She saw me as a close friend

339
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,270
and shared her pain with me constantly.

340
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,520
I felt bad for her

341
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,320
and tried to comfort her

342
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,359
and cheer her up.

343
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,840
I mean,

344
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,840
knowing her condition,

345
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,000
any compassionate individual

346
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,640
would advise her to leave

347
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,000
for freedom,

348
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,400
not to mention I'm a woman, too.

349
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:31,200
We're obligated to help each other.

350
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:34,244
Men like you wouldn't understand.

351
00:16:35,175 --> 00:16:36,880
Did you help her plan out

352
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,500
the escape?

353
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,359
No.

354
00:16:41,119 --> 00:16:43,520
We only talked about

355
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:44,760
A Doll's House by Ibsen

356
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,159
and how women could be

357
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:47,640
independent from their family.

358
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,889
Call me selfish all you want,

359
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,579
but I didn't want to

360
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:53,640
get involved

361
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:56,200
in her escape plan.

362
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,119
Yet whether I liked it or not,

363
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:00,559
I was still involved anyway

364
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,275
and got fired by Mr. Rong, didn't I?

365
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,880
That wasn't your fault.

366
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:09,839
You meant well.

367
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,160
Miss Feng,

368
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,496
did you contact any outsiders for her?

369
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,920
No.

370
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,920
Did you send out messages for her?

371
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,959
No.

372
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,079
Did she say anything about Xitangli?

373
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,040
No.

374
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,675
How did you know Xiao Baoli?

375
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,896
She's a popular showgirl in the city

376
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,000
on her way to becoming a movie star.

377
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:03,720
How come

378
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,160
a college graduate like you

379
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,599
with a decent job

380
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,599
made friends with an escort?

381
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,760
We have all kinds of friends.

382
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,319
What's wrong with that?

383
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,880
Sorry, Jiashang,

384
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,680
but I need to hear it from Miss Feng.

385
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:50,319
It's simple.

386
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,959
When my family was in distress

387
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,000
and we were

388
00:18:55,575 --> 00:18:56,935
knee-deep in debt,

389
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,640
I thought I could be a showgirl

390
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,959
to make money.

391
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,220
Then I met Xiao Baoli

392
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,631
the first time I went to the club.

393
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:10,359
She kept telling me that was a bad idea

394
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,640
that

395
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,839
once I got in,

396
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:14,119
I could never be out.

397
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,800
To help me,

398
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,640
she referred me to a decent moneylender,

399
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,425
Mr. Xiong.

400
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:22,319
You probably know him, Mr. Yang.

401
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,199
He offered me cheap loans

402
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,319
and

403
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:27,359
extensions occasionally.

404
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,439
That was

405
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,060
how Baoli and I became friends.

406
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,719
Identity has nothing
to do with friendship.

407
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:37,040
It's true

408
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:39,640
that Xiao Baoli is an escort

409
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,599
but she's an upright woman

410
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:44,280
and a loyal friend.

411
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,319
I trust her

412
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:47,959
and I don't think

413
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,520
our friendship is wrong.

414
00:19:51,205 --> 00:19:52,325
Sometimes,

415
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:54,604
good or bad is only an idea away.

416
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,280
If Baoli didn't stop me,

417
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,959
I could very well be

418
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,680
a showgirl like her in the club now.

419
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,079
Mr. Jiashang might meet me there

420
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,040
when he and his friends went clubbing.

421
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:08,760
We'd dance

422
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,359
and have fun together

423
00:20:11,439 --> 00:20:12,640
and then go our separate ways.

424
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,839
We wouldn't remember

425
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:17,595
or mean anything to each other.

426
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:19,359
See?

427
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:21,160
One decision

428
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:24,719
could change everything.

429
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,280
Enough.

430
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:35,199
Let's call it a day.

431
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:36,880
One last question.

432
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:39,959
Has Miss Sun contacted you

433
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:42,319
ever since she left?

434
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,239
No.

435
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:46,719
I'm worried about her.

436
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,280
I wonder how she is.

437
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:51,319
After all,

438
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:53,679
a young girl like her

439
00:20:54,225 --> 00:20:55,825
could be an easy target.

440
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,959
Thank you for your cooperation.

441
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,680
No further questions for now.

442
00:21:13,775 --> 00:21:14,680
No problem.

443
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:20,880
I'm fine.

444
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,845
You look worse than me.

445
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,319
The past is the past.

446
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,439
It shouldn't bother you again.

447
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,719
I can handle it.

448
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,121
It's probably better

449
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,040
to get those things off my chest.

450
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,250
Right.

451
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:38,760
Is Jiashang

452
00:21:38,925 --> 00:21:40,400
still going to marry Miss Du

453
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,079
at this stage?

454
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:42,750
Let's go.

455
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,325
Sure.

456
00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:50,839
Yang Xiucheng and I

457
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,199
are going to question the servants next.

458
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:54,719
It's a lot of work.

459
00:21:55,719 --> 00:21:57,199
No time for the class.

460
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,000
Just go back to your room

461
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:00,719
and stay inside.

462
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,300
Sure.

463
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:03,079
Got it.

464
00:22:04,275 --> 00:22:05,239
Butler Zhang.

465
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,119
Yes.

466
00:22:06,175 --> 00:22:07,695
Gather all our servants.

467
00:22:08,025 --> 00:22:09,905
Mr. Yang and I need to question them.

468
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:12,680
Tell Fanglin and Fanghua

469
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:14,680
to stay in their rooms.

470
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,239
Yes, sir.

471
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,625
Miss Feng.

472
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,775
I have a question for you.

473
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,600
Why did you

474
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:33,119
ask me to dance that day?

475
00:22:36,925 --> 00:22:38,005
You tell me

476
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,680
why a woman

477
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:43,119
asked a man to dance.

478
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,500
Miss Feng!

479
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:27,800
Miss Feng!

480
00:23:34,025 --> 00:23:34,719
Fanglin?

481
00:23:34,918 --> 00:23:36,119
- Miss Feng.
- Miss Feng.

482
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:38,040
Do you know what's happening?

483
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,700
There seems to be a mole
in the Residence.

484
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,359
Mr. Yang and Mr. Jiashang
are checking the servants.

485
00:23:44,175 --> 00:23:45,695
Why aren't you in your rooms?

486
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,239
I think

487
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:48,439
it's going to take a while.

488
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:50,880
Why would someone plant a mole?

489
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,880
What do we have here?

490
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,640
It's probably nothing.

491
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,500
Your family business is doing too well.

492
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:57,985
Maybe some competitor

493
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:00,079
is performing corporate espionage.

494
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,990
Why not call the police to arrest him?

495
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,975
We don't know who that person is yet.

496
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:06,319
Besides,

497
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,160
this is

498
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,839
a sensitive matter.

499
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,719
Your father would want to

500
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:12,558
keep it in a tight circle

501
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:14,719
for the sake of your family's image.

502
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:17,694
I want to go take a look.

503
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,199
Don't.

504
00:24:19,199 --> 00:24:20,550
Uncle Zhang just said

505
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,030
to stay in our rooms.

506
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:23,079
Ignore him.

507
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:24,479
We don't need to listen to a servant.

508
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,599
I just want to look at it.

509
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,160
What could possibly go wrong?

510
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,280
Are you coming?

511
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,719
Or I'll go without you.

512
00:24:31,719 --> 00:24:32,725
Just take a look and go.

513
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:33,760
Deal.

514
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:35,200
See you, Miss Feng.

515
00:24:35,425 --> 00:24:36,054
Let's go.

516
00:24:36,054 --> 00:24:36,800
Hold on.

517
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,880
I'll join you.

518
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:41,350
- Sure.
- Sure.

519
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,040
Come.

520
00:24:55,825 --> 00:24:58,184
Did you send out messages for Miss Sun?

521
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,525
I...

522
00:25:02,479 --> 00:25:03,439
I... I...

523
00:25:04,479 --> 00:25:05,175
I...

524
00:25:12,175 --> 00:25:13,400
(Qiao Xingjiao)

525
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,400
I... I... I didn't.

526
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:23,800
I swear!

527
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,375
Don't do this!

528
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,040
Fanglin.

529
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,080
Miss Feng,

530
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,839
what's going on?

531
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:36,560
Jiashang looks so serious.

532
00:25:37,199 --> 00:25:38,400
I'm not sure.

533
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,400
It must be something big.

534
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:42,160
What is Xiucheng saying?

535
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:43,525
I can't make it out.

536
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,959
Girls,

537
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,680
let's go back.

538
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,680
One more minute, please.

539
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,599
Just one minute.

540
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,510
Let me ask you again.

541
00:25:57,825 --> 00:25:59,345
Did you steal money from us?

542
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,225
No.

543
00:26:21,725 --> 00:26:22,900
Mr. Jiashang.

544
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:36,839
You're...?

545
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,160
Guo Dazhuang.

546
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,880
I came three years ago.

547
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,640
My uncle Guo Youfu was the guarantor

548
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,119
who died last year.

549
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,119
Stick to the question.

550
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,839
Don't go off topic.

551
00:26:52,075 --> 00:26:54,035
Did you steal money from us?

552
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:55,119
No.

553
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,680
Or anything else from us?

554
00:26:57,719 --> 00:26:58,439
No.

555
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,479
Did you talk to

556
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:01,800
Miss Sun Shaoqing?

557
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,119
Miss Sun?

558
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,439
I'm just a menial.

559
00:27:05,439 --> 00:27:07,640
I'd never go near the ladies.

560
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,400
Did you leak information to others?

561
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:11,750
No.

562
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,675
I'm going to ask you again.

563
00:27:31,425 --> 00:27:33,346
Did you leak information
about the Residence

564
00:27:34,025 --> 00:27:35,075
to others?

565
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,000
Never... I swear.

566
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,025
Liar!

567
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,239
Mr. Jiashang,

568
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,719
I'm telling the truth.

569
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,375
I know my position. I...

570
00:27:48,225 --> 00:27:50,959
I... I couldn't have known anything

571
00:27:51,199 --> 00:27:52,199
except for maids' small talk.

572
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:54,040
Did you take money from outsiders?

573
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,239
No.

574
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:56,439
Why would I?

575
00:27:56,439 --> 00:27:58,000
I don't work for them.

576
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,280
If you didn't,

577
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:15,880
how did you pay
your mother's medical bills?

578
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:33,700
Seize him!

579
00:28:38,725 --> 00:28:40,550
Miss Fen! Help!

580
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,375
Stay back!

581
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,210
Guo Dazhuang,

582
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:45,100
let Miss Feng go!

583
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,640
There's no need to do this.

584
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,319
Do I look like a fool?

585
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,280
People died in your hands

586
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,800
could overfill the Suzhou River.

587
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,640
What do you want?

588
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,800
Get me a car.

589
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,760
Keep the engine running and doors open.

590
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:02,129
No funny business,

591
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,439
or I'll slit her throat!

592
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:13,920
Guo Dazhuang,

593
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,000
I'll go get the car.

594
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,400
Don't hurt her.

595
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,920
Put your guns away.

596
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,000
Stay back!

597
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:36,880
Don't come any closer!

598
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,750
No guns!

599
00:29:52,325 --> 00:29:53,284
Don't move!

600
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:54,719
Where's my car?

601
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,400
Calm down.

602
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:16,000
Nobody moves!

603
00:30:17,325 --> 00:30:18,125
Don't move!

604
00:30:20,775 --> 00:30:21,775
Don't move!

605
00:30:24,325 --> 00:30:25,325
Don't move!

606
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,760
Sir,

607
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,775
I don't even know you.

608
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,800
Please let me go.

609
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,450
Shut up!

610
00:30:41,275 --> 00:30:42,199
Don't move!

611
00:30:59,239 --> 00:31:00,160
Miss Feng!

612
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,359
- Miss Feng!
- Miss Feng!

613
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:04,225
Miss Feng!

614
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:06,160
- Miss Feng!
- Miss Feng!

615
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,560
Did he hurt you?

616
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,319
I'm fine.

617
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:09,959
Is that a cut?

618
00:31:11,439 --> 00:31:12,359
Just a flesh wound.

619
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,839
Don't worry.

620
00:31:14,275 --> 00:31:15,200
Mr. Jiashang,

621
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,375
what's next?

622
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,160
What are you waiting for?

623
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:19,150
Go get a doctor!

624
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:19,750
Yes!

625
00:31:21,525 --> 00:31:22,319
Get up!

626
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:27,025
Jiashang,

627
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,280
what about him?

628
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,079
Stop his bleeding.

629
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,359
I'll handle him later.

630
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,500
Yes.

631
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:33,950
Watch him closely.

632
00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:35,119
Don't let him kill himself.

633
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:35,900
- Yes!
- Yes!

634
00:31:36,825 --> 00:31:37,600
Move!

635
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,560
- Miss Feng!
- Miss Feng!

636
00:31:40,725 --> 00:31:41,525
- Come.
- I got you.

637
00:31:44,775 --> 00:31:45,631
Careful.

638
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:46,959
Miss Feng!

639
00:32:12,439 --> 00:32:13,800
Weren't you told to stay in your rooms?

640
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,880
We...

641
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,599
We had to take a look.

642
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:21,719
This is huge.

643
00:32:21,719 --> 00:32:23,075
Why didn't you tell us about it?

644
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:24,640
No reason!

645
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:26,000
I kept it from you

646
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,239
to protect you.

647
00:32:28,075 --> 00:32:29,000
Look what happened!

648
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,520
Miss Feng

649
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,800
wouldn't be there anytime

650
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:32,839
to pay for your recklessness!

651
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:37,975
Jiashang,

652
00:32:37,975 --> 00:32:39,735
we don't want this more than you do.

653
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:41,200
Miss Feng,

654
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:43,350
I'm so sorry about what happened.

655
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:44,674
Miss Fang,

656
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,000
it's my fault.

657
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:47,160
Don't blame yourself.

658
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,079
It's over.

659
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,800
Mr. Jiashang,

660
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,850
I'm fine.

661
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:52,680
It's just a small cut.

662
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,300
It'll be gone in a few days.

663
00:33:01,475 --> 00:33:03,719
Let's go back, Fanglin.

664
00:33:04,325 --> 00:33:05,075
Sure.

665
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,160
Get some rest, Miss Feng.

666
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,560
See you.

667
00:33:08,675 --> 00:33:09,325
See you.

668
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,000
Jiashang,

669
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:20,550
I can take care of myself.

670
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:22,700
Just do what you got to do.

671
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,150
Isn't Mr. Yang waiting for you

672
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:26,025
to interrogate Guo Dazhuang?

673
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,350
Alright.

674
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,175
See you later.

675
00:33:32,675 --> 00:33:33,250
See you.

676
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,280
Guo Dazhuang.

677
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,199
He must be

678
00:33:48,199 --> 00:33:50,199
working for Boss, too.

679
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,959
Does he know my identity?

680
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,479
Jiashang,

681
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,950
once you find out the truth,

682
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,611
are you going to shoot me

683
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,475
the way you just did without hesitation?

684
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,275
I know you can hear me.

685
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,875
Wake up,

686
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,500
or don't bother ever again,

687
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,500
you hear?

688
00:34:36,725 --> 00:34:38,285
Your life depends on

689
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,800
how well you cooperate.

690
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,775
Let's say

691
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:47,475
you're a gardener

692
00:34:47,475 --> 00:34:49,200
with no access to the inner courtyard

693
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,639
or important information,

694
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,560
but

695
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:58,155
you could be the messenger.

696
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,840
Who's behind you?

697
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,881
Say it.

698
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:09,675
I don't know.

699
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,925
I really don't.

700
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,800
You don't know?

701
00:35:15,479 --> 00:35:16,439
But

702
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,075
that person does exist,

703
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:18,825
correct?

704
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,725
I'll ask you again.

705
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:45,846
Who is it?

706
00:35:47,075 --> 00:35:47,925
Mr. Jiashang,

707
00:35:48,925 --> 00:35:51,046
I swear I have no idea!

708
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:52,375
I... I... I...

709
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:54,075
I'm begging you!

710
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,175
Please spare me!

711
00:35:56,175 --> 00:35:57,320
Please, Mr. Jiashang!

712
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,800
I won't do it again.

713
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,959
My mother still needs me!

714
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:03,520
Spare me, please!

715
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,375
Mr. Jiashang,

716
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:08,800
I'm begging you!

717
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:13,479
- Mr. Jiashang...
- Sir,

718
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,040
how about some torture?

719
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,679
That's not my style.

720
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,679
Leave him here

721
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,600
until he wants to talk.

722
00:36:24,879 --> 00:36:25,679
Yes.

723
00:36:26,479 --> 00:36:27,399
Mr. Jiashang!

724
00:36:27,399 --> 00:36:29,550
Please let me go!

725
00:36:58,439 --> 00:36:59,719
How do you feel?

726
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,239
Much better now.

727
00:37:01,925 --> 00:37:02,725
Come on in.

728
00:37:10,675 --> 00:37:11,840
Sorry about the mess.

729
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,000
I haven't got to tidy the room.

730
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,821
He scared you, didn't he?

731
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,911
I can't stop thinking about it.

732
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:20,280
But

733
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,080
I'll be fine after some sleep.

734
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,600
Have you had lunch?

735
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,919
Xiao Yu brought me wontons.

736
00:37:27,919 --> 00:37:29,159
They look delicious.

737
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,320
You can have some.

738
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,614
I'm terrified!

739
00:37:43,919 --> 00:37:46,239
I can't stand more losses.

740
00:37:50,675 --> 00:37:51,706
I lost

741
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:56,150
my brother years ago on this day.

742
00:37:58,875 --> 00:37:59,825
You had a brother?

743
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,525
That year,

744
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,479
I was twelve

745
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,540
and Jiaxin was eight.

746
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:12,490
We were studying at a church school.

747
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,119
Usually, Mrs. Rong

748
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:18,049
would pick us up,

749
00:38:22,075 --> 00:38:23,995
but she was needed elsewhere that day.

750
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,450
There was a foreign circus in town.

751
00:38:30,479 --> 00:38:31,679
Our attendant

752
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:32,959
had been paid by someone else.

753
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:35,520
He said he'd take us to see the circus.

754
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,120
I didn't suspect a thing

755
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:43,775
and left with him with my brother.

756
00:38:46,225 --> 00:38:48,150
Rong Dingkun will give me anything

757
00:38:48,439 --> 00:38:50,159
to get his two sons back.

758
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:55,800
Write to your father.

759
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,275
Oh.

760
00:38:56,275 --> 00:38:57,919
Ask him for money.

761
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,040
Do it.

762
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:02,280
Don't write anything else,

763
00:39:02,925 --> 00:39:04,725
or I'll kill you!

764
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,070
When help was on the way to get us out,

765
00:39:11,925 --> 00:39:13,565
those kidnappers decided to flee.

766
00:39:14,975 --> 00:39:15,760
Boss,

767
00:39:16,399 --> 00:39:17,439
people are coming.

768
00:39:17,479 --> 00:39:18,399
They called the police, too.

769
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:19,600
Let's get out of here.

770
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,719
Come on. Let's go.

771
00:39:23,399 --> 00:39:24,425
Boss,

772
00:39:24,425 --> 00:39:25,399
those two boys

773
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:26,679
will slow us down.

774
00:39:27,025 --> 00:39:28,875
I'll take care of the elder one.

775
00:39:28,875 --> 00:39:29,879
Father! Mother!

776
00:39:29,879 --> 00:39:31,150
Help!

777
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,479
The other kidnapper had me.

778
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,550
I saw Jiaxin was stifled to death bit by bit

779
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,600
but couldn't do anything about it.

780
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,199
Originally,

781
00:39:52,575 --> 00:39:54,256
they planned

782
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,239
to kill me

783
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,760
and take Jiaxin away,

784
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,400
but then he started to cry aloud.

785
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,150
If he hadn't,

786
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:09,609
I would've been the dead one.

787
00:40:17,725 --> 00:40:19,324
Those kidnappers

788
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,850
killed your brother in cold blood.

789
00:40:22,175 --> 00:40:23,675
Neither of you should've suffered that.

790
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,520
Your brother didn't die because of you.

791
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,725
As you know,

792
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,550
Mrs. Rong hates my guts.

793
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:43,800
But back then,

794
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:46,250
she wasn't like that.

795
00:40:48,075 --> 00:40:49,835
She'd read me bedtime stories

796
00:40:50,925 --> 00:40:52,375
and tuck me in.

797
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,500
All that ended

798
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,425
on the day Jiaxin died.

799
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:03,075
She's been blaming me
for his death since then.

800
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:10,500
She isn't wrong, though.

801
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:15,750
If I hadn't taken him out,

802
00:41:18,919 --> 00:41:20,450
none of that would've happened.

803
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,850
You were a kid yourself.

804
00:41:32,919 --> 00:41:33,840
Jiashang,

805
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,040
those kidnappers

806
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:37,900
killed your brother,

807
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:40,000
not you.

808
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,220
You're the victim, too,

809
00:41:44,479 --> 00:41:45,959
only with better luck.

810
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:50,970
Don't feel guilty

811
00:41:52,225 --> 00:41:53,425
about being the survivor.

812
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:58,225
But others thought differently.

813
00:42:01,625 --> 00:42:03,575
Mrs. Rong wanted me gone.

814
00:42:05,919 --> 00:42:07,750
Relatives said nasty things about me.

815
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,700
My father...

816
00:42:17,425 --> 00:42:19,075
He kicked me out in the end.

817
00:42:27,375 --> 00:42:28,850
You're not alone.

818
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,850
You'll get back

819
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,575
what you've lost.
