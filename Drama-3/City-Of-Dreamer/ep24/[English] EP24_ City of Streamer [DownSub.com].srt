00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,100
=Episode 24=

3
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,919
I want to talk to you.

4
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Wait a minute.

5
00:01:56,525 --> 00:01:57,600
Let go.

6
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:02,000
How are things going?

7
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,400
Rong Jiashang appeased

8
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,281
the residents of Wenchunli with money.

9
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:15,000
That's settled down for now.

10
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:20,200
But the weird thing is

11
00:02:20,775 --> 00:02:23,055
who leaked the news to the press.

12
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,875
I can't find a clue about it.

13
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,440
What about Rong Dingkun?

14
00:02:26,775 --> 00:02:27,880
Rong Dingkun

15
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,350
is shrewd and suspicious.

16
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,919
He must know

17
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,720
that I'm not that stupid
to go against him in such a way.

18
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,930
My aunt told me

19
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,075
that she needs to plan your wedding
with Jiashang as soon as possible.

20
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,440
I guess so.

21
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,440
Rong Dingkun

22
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,929
has been close with my father recently.

23
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,700
What about Rong Jiashang?

24
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,325
He doesn't have any response?

25
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,880
His relationship is a mess.

26
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,440
How would he have time to care about me?

27
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,625
What about you?

28
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,399
Do you still want to marry him?

29
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:25,800
Otherwise?

30
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,879
It's a deal.

31
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,900
It's not like I can break it as I want.

32
00:03:40,675 --> 00:03:41,955
The thought of

33
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,551
the fact that you're going to marry him

34
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,150
and bear children for him

35
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:52,325
makes me feel...

36
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:11,679
Your brother

37
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,110
doesn't talk much

38
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,960
and barely comes back these days.

39
00:04:15,225 --> 00:04:17,400
He always said he was on duty.

40
00:04:17,775 --> 00:04:19,815
I'm afraid he is mad at us.

41
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,250
Mother.

42
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,320
Don't think too much about it.

43
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,600
Probably he's too busy.

44
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:27,750
No matter how busy he is,

45
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,021
he still should go home.

46
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,050
In fact,

47
00:04:32,175 --> 00:04:33,775
I know that your brother

48
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,399
has been stubborn since he was a kid.

49
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,625
He is a man of principle.

50
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,320
He just wants

51
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,040
the Rong family to apologize.

52
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,760
But you

53
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,691
signed a deal with them

54
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,725
and took the gold bars.

55
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,519
Did that

56
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,200
hurt his feelings?

57
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,525
Mother.

58
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:01,119
Think about this,

59
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,040
since Shixun bought the tickets

60
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,160
and agreed to accompany me
to visit the grave,

61
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,330
it means he still cares about me.

62
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,519
When I get to Bailiu Town,

63
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,279
I'll explain it to him.

64
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,959
This weekend is the anniversary
of your birth mother's death.

65
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,675
Have you got

66
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,359
everything ready?

67
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,479
It's the 20th anniversary of her death.

68
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,200
I want to do a ritual for her.

69
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,851
She gave me my life,

70
00:05:31,525 --> 00:05:33,364
but I can't even remember her face.

71
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:37,480
I'm an unfilial child.

72
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,920
Have you remembered

73
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,280
anything over these years?

74
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,750
I dreamed about it sometimes,

75
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,425
but it was about the same pieces

76
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,900
over and over again.

77
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:01,500
I only remember

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,500
that my little brother was crying,

79
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,399
and my mother shouted to me

80
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:09,600
and asked me to run.

81
00:06:23,775 --> 00:06:25,174
It was more than 20 years ago.

82
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,341
I don't know
if my little brother's still alive.

83
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,425
I hope

84
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,575
there was a nice family

85
00:06:43,675 --> 00:06:45,175
that took him in.

86
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,119
Mr. Jiashang.

87
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:54,559
Mrs. Feng took the gold bars.

88
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:56,100
She exchanged the gold bars
for money on the same day

89
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,370
and put the money in the bank.

90
00:06:57,775 --> 00:06:59,575
I think Miss Feng and her brother

91
00:06:59,575 --> 00:07:00,775
won't cause any more trouble.

92
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,500
Did Miss Feng say anything

93
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,364
when you sent them the gold bars?

94
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,325
Miss Feng hadn't come back
when I arrived.

95
00:07:09,325 --> 00:07:11,150
I stayed near the gate as you ordered.

96
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,675
About two hours later,

97
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,920
Miss Feng came back.

98
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,239
But she hasn't been out

99
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:18,359
since she came back.

100
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,500
It's Mrs. Feng who has been

101
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,541
doing the grocery shopping these days.

102
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,959
Okay, I see.

103
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,959
You can leave.

104
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,760
Yes.

105
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,239
Hello?

106
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,320
Mr. Rong.

107
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:31,880
This is

108
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,625
Wang Chunhua from Red House Hospital.

109
00:07:34,725 --> 00:07:35,675
Nurse Wang.

110
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,549
How is it going
with what I asked you to do?

111
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,679
Dr. Feng bought two tickets
for three days from now

112
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:43,399
to visit a grave with his younger sister
in the countryside.

113
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,399
It's a place called Bailiu Town.

114
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,399
But Dr. Feng didn't say

115
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,959
whose grave it is.

116
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,640
It's inconvenient for me to ask.

117
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,239
Okay, I see.

118
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,025
I'll contact you later.

119
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:56,000
Okay.

120
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,799
Hello.

121
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,225
Is this Red House Hospital?

122
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,450
Put me through to Director Joseph.

123
00:08:17,075 --> 00:08:18,040
Shixun.

124
00:08:18,275 --> 00:08:19,175
You just finished the night shift.

125
00:08:19,175 --> 00:08:20,275
Are you not going back to get some rest?

126
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:22,959
I'll go to the countryside
with my sister this afternoon.

127
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,559
I'm going to be late. I'll go straight

128
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:25,679
to the train station.

129
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,710
Dr. Feng!

130
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,809
Thank God you haven't left.

131
00:08:27,809 --> 00:08:28,880
There is a major surgery

132
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,040
and you're needed as an assistant.

133
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,239
Hurry up and get ready.

134
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,975
- So sudden?
- Ah.

135
00:08:32,975 --> 00:08:34,280
Can't Wenpei do it?

136
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,880
I applied for switching my shift.

137
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,880
He has a plan.

138
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,799
I can do it.

139
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,039
You can't.

140
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,080
Director Joseph ordered it himself.

141
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,359
He designated you.

142
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:43,119
Moreover,

143
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:43,799
Liu Yingchun

144
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,325
will perform the operation in person.

145
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,239
There are a lot of people
fighting to be his assistant.

146
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:48,039
Dr. Feng.

147
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,760
You mustn't miss such an opportunity.

148
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,119
Well, you better get going.

149
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,500
- Nurse Wang.
- Mm.

150
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,061
Please go to the train station later

151
00:08:58,925 --> 00:08:59,719
and make sure

152
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:01,250
to give this to my sister.

153
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:02,320
Okay.

154
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,280
Rest assured, Dr. Feng.

155
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,200
Thank you.

156
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,950
(Waiting Room)

157
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:10,000
(Shanghai Red House Hospital)

158
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,435
Mr. Rong.

159
00:09:15,435 --> 00:09:16,160
Mm.

160
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,200
(Shizhen, something came up.
I can't go with you. Shixun.)

161
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,799
You've gone through a lot

162
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,425
for your sweetheart.

163
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,960
Ever since it happened,

164
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:37,200
she hasn't been out for days.

165
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,531
My men can't find anything about her.

166
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,525
I have to start with her brother.

167
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,280
What will you do when you find her?

168
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,725
What if she still blames you?

169
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,479
Let's play it by ear.

170
00:09:59,925 --> 00:10:01,200
Keep your stuff well.

171
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:02,600
Be careful on the road.

172
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,750
Write to me.

173
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,750
(TELEPHONE)
Do you want me to buy some for you?

174
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,350
Boss.

175
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,206
I was about to send people
to look for you,

176
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,919
and then you called me.

177
00:10:11,175 --> 00:10:12,150
I heard

178
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,910
that the affected households
in Wenchunli

179
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,200
all signed the contracts

180
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,775
and took the gold bars
from the Rong family.

181
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,799
Did you also sign it?

182
00:10:18,425 --> 00:10:19,280
Yes.

183
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,440
I didn't expect

184
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,679
that Rong Jiashang would break in
with gold bars during the negotiation.

185
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,280
The neighbors in Wenchunli

186
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,139
suffered heavy losses from the fire.

187
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,000
It was hard not to be tempted

188
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,239
in the face of such a huge compensation.

189
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,651
If I didn't go along with them
and sign the contract,

190
00:10:32,025 --> 00:10:33,585
Rong Dingkun would suspect me

191
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,975
with his nature.

192
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,760
Please show your ticket.

193
00:10:38,075 --> 00:10:39,159
The railway station?

194
00:10:39,675 --> 00:10:40,760
Are you going somewhere far away?

195
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,599
Yes.

196
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:44,075
I'm going to Bailiu Town
with my older brother

197
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:45,325
to commemorate my birth mother.

198
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:48,599
Okay.

199
00:10:49,175 --> 00:10:50,275
Have a safe trip.

200
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,760
Goodbye.

201
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,000
Get on board!

202
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,400
Hurry! Get on board!

203
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:03,679
The train to Nanjing!

204
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,679
The train to Nanjing will leave soon!

205
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,679
Go back, go back.

206
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,025
The train will leave soon!

207
00:11:11,359 --> 00:11:12,359
Go back, go back!

208
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:14,640
Get on board! Get on board!

209
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:17,000
The passengers to Nanjing, hurry!

210
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,119
The train will leave soon!

211
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,825
This is your compartment, Miss.

212
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,050
Thank you.

213
00:11:34,175 --> 00:11:36,440
Little sister, you're traveling alone.

214
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,880
Doesn't your family worry about you?

215
00:11:38,325 --> 00:11:39,684
My older brother will be here soon.

216
00:11:39,684 --> 00:11:40,975
(Shanghai Railway Station)

217
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,880
Little sister.

218
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,520
I think your older brother

219
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,675
won't come.

220
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:47,960
That's the way men are.

221
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,359
They can be really sweet

222
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:50,640
when they make a promise.

223
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,650
But by the time...

224
00:11:53,575 --> 00:11:55,696
Sorry, I'm late.

225
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:00,450
Excuse me.

226
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,131
Dr. Feng asked me to give this to you.

227
00:12:13,475 --> 00:12:15,150
(Shizhen, something came up at
the hospital. I can't go with you.)

228
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,700
(Be careful on the road, Shixun.)

229
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:18,640
Little sister.

230
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,799
I haven't met anyone

231
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:21,919
who is as good-looking
as this gentleman.

232
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,405
Dear, look at his manner,

233
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,250
and the quality of his suit.

234
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,880
Your watch is beautiful indeed.

235
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,000
Are these diamonds on it?

236
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,875
One diamond would cost
hundreds of silver dollars.

237
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,150
May I ask where you are working at?

238
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,500
Pardon me, you must be a young master.

239
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,400
Oh, right.

240
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,919
I booked a spare room next door.

241
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,520
Sir.

242
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:46,775
Why don't you take your wife there
and have some quiet time?

243
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:47,960
Okay.

244
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:49,025
Thanks.

245
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:49,925
Let's go.

246
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,800
Sorry.

247
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,070
You've lost weight.

248
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,150
Haven't you rested well lately?

249
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,450
I don't mean anything else.

250
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,485
I just want to spend more time with you.

251
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,225
You don't want to see me,

252
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,350
so I come to see you.

253
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,225
Miss Feng.

254
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,950
Just think of me as a friend.

255
00:13:54,525 --> 00:13:56,950
I'll try to like you
a little less every day.

256
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,479
Maybe I won't bother you

257
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:01,875
after a while.

258
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,679
Miss Feng.

259
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,640
Be patient with me like you were
when you tamed me before.

260
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,700
Bear with me for a while.

261
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,400
I will abide by the rules of etiquette

262
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,341
and never do anything you don't like.

263
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:58,075
Miss Feng.

264
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,719
This is the Brazilian coffee

265
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:02,200
from an import and export company.

266
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,280
Have a try.

267
00:15:12,275 --> 00:15:13,314
And this.

268
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,960
I had someone find a French chef

269
00:15:16,025 --> 00:15:17,650
to make the dessert.

270
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,599
I was thinking that you got up early
to catch the train

271
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:21,025
and you must have eaten nothing.

272
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,550
Have some.

273
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:37,575
Miss Feng.

274
00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:40,840
I just want to create

275
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,520
some good memories that belong to us.

276
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,480
I don't want it to only be hatred

277
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,081
when you remember me.

278
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:56,925
I don't hate you.

279
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:00,080
Really?

280
00:16:05,425 --> 00:16:07,400
It was all my fault.

281
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:11,550
Can we just put it aside for a second?

282
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,650
Just think of me as a student, a friend,

283
00:16:17,975 --> 00:16:19,450
or an errand boy for a few days.

284
00:16:22,575 --> 00:16:24,176
As long as you let me stay by your side,

285
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,220
I'll be good and listen to you.

286
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,300
Okay?

287
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,275
I'll take your silence

288
00:16:43,425 --> 00:16:44,824
as a yes.

289
00:16:56,359 --> 00:16:57,375
Try some.

290
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,200
(Bailiu Town Exit)

291
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,100
Hold the umbrella.

292
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,760
Rickshaw! Rickshaw!

293
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,560
- Rickshaw!
- Rickshaw!

294
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,675
Get in the rickshaw!

295
00:17:07,675 --> 00:17:08,425
Be careful.

296
00:17:08,425 --> 00:17:09,625
- Rickshaw!
- Need a ride?

297
00:17:10,075 --> 00:17:10,999
Rickshaw!

298
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:11,839
My car is over there.

299
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,650
Let me give you a ride.

300
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,500
Need a ride, sir?

301
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,475
No need.

302
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,050
- Rickshaw!
- Rickshaw!

303
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,975
(Bailiu Town Exit)

304
00:17:18,975 --> 00:17:20,075
Rickshaw!

305
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,975
- Need a ride?
- Need a ride?

306
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,225
Let's go.

307
00:17:24,075 --> 00:17:25,275
Where do you want to go, Miss?

308
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,160
Let me take it.

309
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,125
Come on.

310
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,160
Be careful.

311
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,040
Rickshaw!

312
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:30,160
Need a ride, sir?

313
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,439
To Dongfenglai Inn.

314
00:17:32,439 --> 00:17:33,175
Okay.

315
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:35,325
Sit well!

316
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,875
Miss Feng.

317
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,800
Let me take it for you.

318
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,475
Sir.

319
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,839
Are you hungry?

320
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,520
I'll treat you to a meal.

321
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,525
Mm.

322
00:18:57,725 --> 00:19:00,275
(Mrs. Wang's Beef Noodles)

323
00:19:01,275 --> 00:19:02,116
Ma'am.

324
00:19:02,116 --> 00:19:02,800
Yes.

325
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,839
Two bowls of beef noodles, please.

326
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:05,079
One large bowl and one small bowl.

327
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:06,079
More chilies

328
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,079
for the large bowl.

329
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,079
No problem.

330
00:19:25,775 --> 00:19:27,040
Did you come here a lot before?

331
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:28,880
No.

332
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,949
Only once a year
on the death anniversary.

333
00:19:32,275 --> 00:19:35,275
Bailiu Town is crappy and small.

334
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,350
I'm just afraid
that you're not used to this.

335
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,569
I'm not that squeamish.

336
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,225
When I was in military school,

337
00:19:43,479 --> 00:19:45,975
I had field survival training
for a month every semester.

338
00:19:46,525 --> 00:19:48,206
I needed to live in the wilderness,

339
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,825
and make fire and cook on my own.

340
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:50,719
Oh, right.

341
00:19:50,925 --> 00:19:52,760
I remember going hunting
in the wild at that time.

342
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,239
I gutted the wild rabbit,

343
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,280
rubbed it with salt,

344
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,400
put honey on it,

345
00:19:56,439 --> 00:19:57,839
and roasted it over a fire.

346
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:59,079
When it was done,

347
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:00,079
I just took a bite.

348
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,720
It was really delicious.

349
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,425
Oh, right.

350
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,199
I'll take you to the Cao River
to shoot ducks.

351
00:20:06,199 --> 00:20:08,239
The wild ducks there are fat and stupid.

352
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:10,199
A young lady like you
who has never used a gun

353
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:11,560
can still shoot one or two.

354
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,050
Only if we can meet again

355
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,161
in the spring...

356
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,719
Thank you.

357
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,079
I remember

358
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,599
the noodles you made for me earlier.

359
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,750
I've never had
such delicious noodles again.

360
00:20:46,425 --> 00:20:48,185
I'm glad you still remember my taste.

361
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,199
Miss Feng.

362
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:56,920
Thank you.

363
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,719
For what?

364
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,079
Anyway, thank you.

365
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,654
It feels

366
00:21:09,575 --> 00:21:10,500
nice.

367
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,600
Hurry up and eat.

368
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:18,950
Mm.

369
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,350
Are you all right, Miss Feng?

370
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:42,119
Sit well.

371
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,120
Sorry.

372
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,079
The road is bumpy.

373
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:49,350
Miss Feng, you should sit still.

374
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:56,890
Are you all right?

375
00:21:57,725 --> 00:21:58,300
Hey.

376
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,280
Drive slowly.

377
00:22:01,725 --> 00:22:03,325
I'm sorry, Mr. Jiashang.

378
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,520
Don't you know that

379
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,760
this would help you sit securely?

380
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:13,560
Didn't you study physics before?

381
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,400
If you want to be secure,

382
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,239
why don't you get off and walk?

383
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,920
Hands off.

384
00:22:29,439 --> 00:22:30,280
Look.

385
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,270
It's not that I don't want
to put my hands off you.

386
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:04,550
(Lanruo Monastery)

387
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,680
Benefactor, benefactress.

388
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:19,025
(The Spirit Tablet of Mother Bai)

389
00:23:49,075 --> 00:23:51,675
(The Spirit Tablet of Mother Bai)

390
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:05,100
Mom!

391
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:06,560
Mom!

392
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,300
(Lanruo Monastery)

393
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,230
The meal is not ready yet.

394
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:34,535
Let's take a walk.

395
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,079
Okay.

396
00:24:51,479 --> 00:24:54,300
Who is that Bai person to you?

397
00:24:56,199 --> 00:24:57,239
She was my birth mother.

398
00:24:58,950 --> 00:24:59,959
Your birth mother?

399
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,839
Well,

400
00:25:03,075 --> 00:25:04,375
what about Mrs. Feng...?

401
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,280
I thought Yang Xiucheng

402
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,675
did a thorough

403
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:11,925
background check on me.

404
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,599
It turns out you didn't know

405
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:16,525
I'm an orphan
adopted by the Feng family.

406
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,300
I didn't know it.

407
00:25:22,525 --> 00:25:24,775
I thought you were born
in the Feng family.

408
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,220
When I was a child,

409
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,850
my mother took my little brother
and me to visit relatives.

410
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:34,439
We met bandits on our way.

411
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,175
My mother was killed

412
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,900
and my little brother was lost.

413
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:42,920
The Feng family saved me

414
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:44,800
and raised me.

415
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,520
They treat me like their own.

416
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,800
In my heart,

417
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,800
Mr. Feng and Mrs. Feng
are my real parents,

418
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:55,596
and Shixun is my real big brother.

419
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:00,750
Do you have any other
family members at home?

420
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,850
What was your original last name?

421
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,560
I don't remember.

422
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,100
I was two or three years old.

423
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,400
I only remember

424
00:26:10,675 --> 00:26:12,079
that my name was Zhenzhen.

425
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,720
My mother's last name was Bai.

426
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:16,959
And the daughter

427
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:19,439
in the Feng family
who died young was also named Zhenzhen.

428
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:23,875
I'm surprised that the Feng family
didn't lie about who you are.

429
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,275
When they saved me,

430
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:29,100
I was almost three years old.

431
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,725
I can vaguely remember something.

432
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,319
Over these years,

433
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,875
I still dream about that day
all the time.

434
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,959
My mother used her body
to block the blade

435
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,640
so I could get away.

436
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:46,160
She died miserably.

437
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:51,454
I come here every year
to commemorate her.

438
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:56,600
Have you ever looked for

439
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,541
other family members?

440
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,839
Look for them?

441
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:04,199
How?

442
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,479
We're not locals.

443
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,359
My mother died
in the middle of our trip.

444
00:27:11,675 --> 00:27:13,025
I don't know anyone.

445
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:20,920
I'm actually very lucky.

446
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:23,800
The Feng family treats me
like one of their own

447
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,450
and they sent me to college.

448
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,409
But my little brother

449
00:27:33,425 --> 00:27:35,025
was only a few months old.

450
00:27:37,475 --> 00:27:39,514
I don't know if he is alive or dead.

451
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,550
I'm sure he's still alive.

452
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,600
I'm sure he found a nice family

453
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,025
and grew up safely.

454
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,275
When the time comes,

455
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,319
he will come to see you.

456
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:16,725
Don't move.

457
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,675
I just want to hug you.

458
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,000
Let's go.

459
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,800
The meal is almost ready.

460
00:28:57,025 --> 00:28:57,719
Are you okay?

461
00:28:59,225 --> 00:29:00,000
I'm okay.

462
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,359
I guess I have to do this.

463
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,359
Come on.

464
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,400
I'm okay.

465
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,160
Hurry up.

466
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:18,400
Hold me tight.

467
00:29:27,925 --> 00:29:29,844
When I was in college,

468
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:32,750
I read a geology book.

469
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,459
It said that where we're standing
right now

470
00:29:35,725 --> 00:29:37,245
was a vast expanse of water

471
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,075
billions of years ago.

472
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,439
I don't know if it will
turn into the sea again

473
00:29:44,475 --> 00:29:46,400
billions of years later.

474
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:49,225
Perhaps it will turn into the sea again.

475
00:29:50,975 --> 00:29:52,174
Everything in the world

476
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:53,989
has a reincarnation.

477
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,551
When the water comes,

478
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:58,035
there will be nothing left.

479
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,880
If Shanghai is flooded,

480
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,125
I'll row a boat and escape with you.

481
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,880
I just don't know

482
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,470
if you will come with me.

483
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,839
If there is nothing left,

484
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:11,560
where can we escape to?

485
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:13,959
To the end of the world.

486
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:16,675
Oh, right,

487
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,160
I should fly a plane to pick you up.

488
00:30:19,479 --> 00:30:20,359
At that time,

489
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,681
we will fly to plateaus with mountains,

490
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,680
getting through the clouds

491
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,400
with the ocean under us.

492
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:28,891
Just the two of us.

493
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,006
We will fly all the way ahead

494
00:30:31,439 --> 00:30:32,959
to the end of the world.

495
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:34,479
Fool.

496
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:36,439
You'll need to take care

497
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:37,950
of your wife and your children.

498
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,350
I'll need to take care
of my husband, too.

499
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:43,216
How can I get on your plane?

500
00:30:44,925 --> 00:30:45,925
Yeah.

501
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,460
It's a bummer.

502
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,719
The train will leave at 2:30 PM.

503
00:31:05,719 --> 00:31:07,239
I'm gonna go upstairs and pack.

504
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:08,796
Okay.

505
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,700
I'll wait for you here.

506
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,500
Okay.

507
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:27,000
- Sir.
- Yes.

508
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,800
I want to ask you about something.

509
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,450
Okay.

510
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,560
I heard a mother and two kids

511
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,639
were mugged here.

512
00:31:42,975 --> 00:31:45,119
Bailiu Town is a small place,

513
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:46,675
but it had been peaceful.

514
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,800
There wasn't even a thief before.

515
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,920
What happened at that time

516
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:53,400
really freaked out everyone in the town.

517
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:54,680
Think about it,

518
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:56,560
the place where it happened

519
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,875
is less than a mile from here.

520
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,439
No one ever saw the bandits?

521
00:32:01,075 --> 00:32:01,795
No.

522
00:32:02,025 --> 00:32:03,586
The bandits killed them all.

523
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,199
That was

524
00:32:05,825 --> 00:32:06,865
a slash on the neck.

525
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:08,700
They couldn't even scream.

526
00:32:09,075 --> 00:32:10,280
Did no one in this town

527
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,040
see the mother and the children?

528
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:14,040
(Dongfenglai Inn)
I think they came from the south

529
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:15,520
and were heading for the northeast.

530
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,100
You can go to the tea house
by the South Bridge

531
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:17,820
and ask them.

532
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,479
The passersby like

533
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:22,520
to take a break there and have some tea.

534
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,200
Okay.

535
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:30,239
Thanks!

536
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,079
Thanks!

537
00:32:33,725 --> 00:32:34,520
Miss Feng!

538
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,460
Miss Feng!

539
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,075
Miss Feng!

540
00:32:42,675 --> 00:32:44,515
Why did you ask about that?

541
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,199
Don't you want to find your family?

542
00:32:47,975 --> 00:32:49,495
Maybe your father
is also looking for you.

543
00:32:50,575 --> 00:32:51,335
Looking for me?

544
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,325
It has been 20 years.

545
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,239
If he wants to find me,

546
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,040
he should be here by now
even he crawls here.

547
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,359
It's not 2:00 PM yet.

548
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,280
This is not a big town.

549
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,619
We can make it to the South Bridge.

550
00:33:02,575 --> 00:33:04,675
Why are you so interested in it?

551
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:06,800
If you like solving crimes,

552
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,079
why don't you work
at the police station?

553
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,359
I'm trying to help you.

554
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,320
I don't want to pry into your privacy.

555
00:33:12,025 --> 00:33:12,839
Miss Feng.

556
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:14,825
You got separated from your real family.

557
00:33:14,825 --> 00:33:16,239
Maybe they're looking for you, too.

558
00:33:16,239 --> 00:33:17,720
My family is the Feng family.

559
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,199
My parents are kind to me.

560
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:20,319
They treat me like I was their own.

561
00:33:20,439 --> 00:33:21,239
Well,

562
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,160
the Feng family is on the ropes,

563
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:25,239
so I should be in a hurry
to find my birth father

564
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,560
and turn to him

565
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,719
if he is rich?

566
00:33:27,719 --> 00:33:29,000
Of course not.

567
00:33:29,225 --> 00:33:30,304
That's not who you are.

568
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:32,479
I know you're close
with the Feng family.

569
00:33:33,275 --> 00:33:34,599
Even you don't want to see them,

570
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:36,079
don't you want
to find your little brother?

571
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,000
Don't you want to find the killer?

572
00:33:41,239 --> 00:33:42,119
Since we are here,

573
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:43,331
let's go.

574
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,475
(I feel grief and joy to meet you again.
The snow stops and the geese fly away.)

575
00:34:07,719 --> 00:34:08,959
How much do you remember

576
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,600
about your childhood?

577
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:14,075
I was too little.

578
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,050
I have some vague memories.

579
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,820
I remember

580
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,120
that my mother took me
and my little brother

581
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,520
and we were sitting on a cart.

582
00:34:26,425 --> 00:34:28,080
When we met the bandit,

583
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,879
my mother asked me to run.

584
00:34:33,479 --> 00:34:34,560
Did you see the bandit?

585
00:34:37,525 --> 00:34:39,000
Only a shadow.

586
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,050
Sometimes he is a big black dog

587
00:34:43,925 --> 00:34:45,520
in my dream

588
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,545
coming at me and trying to bite me.

589
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,399
Sometimes,

590
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:52,856
he is a big rock

591
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:55,195
falling on me

592
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,340
from the sky.

593
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,300
Do you remember
when you were three years old?

594
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,679
I remember playing in the garden

595
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,159
when I was little.

596
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,560
I got stung by a bee

597
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,700
cried in pain.

598
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:16,400
Later, I asked my nanny

599
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:18,120
and she said it happened
when I was three years old.

600
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,250
There was another time

601
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,479
when Mrs. Rong

602
00:35:22,479 --> 00:35:24,475
gave birth to Fanglin and Jiaxin.

603
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:26,120
I went to rock their cradle,

604
00:35:26,439 --> 00:35:27,439
but I rocked it too hard,

605
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:28,280
and they started to cry.

606
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,959
Mrs. Rong rushed over

607
00:35:30,399 --> 00:35:31,679
and pushed me to the ground.

608
00:35:32,879 --> 00:35:34,175
I was either three

609
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,959
or four years old at that time.

610
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,725
All right.

611
00:35:40,479 --> 00:35:42,239
Now it's my turn to feel sorry for you.

612
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:46,560
We are both motherless children.

613
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,250
My father only exists in name.

614
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:52,400
We are in the same boat.

615
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:54,679
We are not in the same boat.

616
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,700
My parents are good to me.

617
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,600
Yeah.

618
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,320
I'm quite envious of you.

619
00:36:14,575 --> 00:36:16,450
(Tea)

620
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,490
Here, have some tea.

621
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,300
Thanks.

622
00:36:19,825 --> 00:36:21,305
(Tea)
Sir, go on.

623
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,719
I remember

624
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:24,840
they took a break here
when they passed by.

625
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,199
How could I not remember them?

626
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,199
The three of them were in a donkey cart.

627
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:29,760
They came from the southwest.

628
00:36:29,879 --> 00:36:32,239
The baby's diaper was wet

629
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:34,325
and she changed the diaper on my table.

630
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,100
There was also a little girl

631
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,639
about three or four years old.

632
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:41,800
Look.

633
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,840
How good your little brother is.

634
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,679
He doesn't cry at all.

635
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,120
Sir.

636
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,879
Do you remember anything else?

637
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,800
That little girl you just mentioned

638
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:58,025
is me.

639
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,159
You are still alive!

640
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,000
What a blessing!

641
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:08,650
Do you remember
where my mother came from?

642
00:37:09,439 --> 00:37:12,050
They sat here for a while and then left.

643
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:14,000
Your mother's accent

644
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,000
sounded like she was from Guojia Town.

645
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:19,975
Are you sure it's Guojia Town?

646
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,239
Well...

647
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,275
What's wrong with Guojia Town?

648
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,280
Nothing.

649
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,175
Go on, please.

650
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,075
I'm not sure if they were

651
00:37:39,399 --> 00:37:40,120
from Guojia Town.

652
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,150
There are Guojia Town,

653
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:43,100
Futian Village

654
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,250
and Wanjin Village over there.

655
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,425
The accents are similar.

656
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:46,560
Well, I think

657
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,919
it was all fate.

658
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:50,239
How is that?

659
00:37:50,879 --> 00:37:52,750
The sun was falling down

660
00:37:52,879 --> 00:37:54,280
when the three of them came here.

661
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,050
My wife advised her

662
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:57,239
to stay over at the inn

663
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,159
and leave tomorrow.

664
00:37:58,775 --> 00:37:59,450
But

665
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:01,040
she said someone was waiting ahead.

666
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:01,850
Then

667
00:38:02,919 --> 00:38:04,000
she left.

668
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,280
If she hadn't left that day,

669
00:38:07,439 --> 00:38:09,719
such a tragedy wouldn't have happened.

670
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,025
Sir.

671
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,925
Do you remember
what that driver looked like?

672
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,040
He was a young man.

673
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:17,959
He called the woman sister-in-law.

674
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,175
I guess he was her husband's brother.

675
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:22,500
But...

676
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:25,150
But what?

677
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:29,479
But the man had a northern accent

678
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:31,175
and he was tall.

679
00:38:31,439 --> 00:38:32,375
He was not a local.

680
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,675
Did he die, too?

681
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,439
No.

682
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:36,879
There was only the woman's body
at the scene.

683
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,100
I talked to the neighbors about it.

684
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:40,000
How weird

685
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,399
was it?

686
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,800
The man driving the cart
is most suspicious.

687
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,800
Even if he's not the killer,

688
00:38:55,879 --> 00:38:57,679
he should know who your father is.

689
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,775
If we find him,

690
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:00,560
maybe we can find some clues.

691
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,760
You seemed surprised

692
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:05,715
when the owner mentioned Guojia Town.

693
00:39:07,919 --> 00:39:09,239
Not surprised.

694
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,479
I just found it coincidental.

695
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:12,360
My family

696
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,850
also came from Guojia Town.

697
00:39:15,399 --> 00:39:16,199
Really?

698
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:16,875
Mm.

699
00:39:17,825 --> 00:39:19,224
That is coincidental indeed.

700
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:23,800
But our relatives there all passed away.

701
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,425
My father left home to work
when he was young.

702
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,479
There was a plague back home
at that time

703
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,239
and our close relatives almost all died.

704
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,840
My father avoided it

705
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,800
because he was out there.

706
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,181
If my mother also came from Guojia Town,

707
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:43,919
maybe

708
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,480
we are relatives.

709
00:39:46,919 --> 00:39:48,150
Maybe you are my cousin.

710
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,750
Shizhen.

711
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,439
I'll stop right now

712
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,639
if you don't want to look into it.

713
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,199
But if you want to find the murderer

714
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,719
and your little brother,

715
00:40:05,919 --> 00:40:07,679
I'll find out the truth for you.

716
00:40:13,399 --> 00:40:14,360
Shizhen.

717
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,959
Use me.

718
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,120
I can do a lot of things you can't.

719
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,360
I knew.

720
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:34,879
I knew it long ago.

721
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:49,840
(Exit)

722
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,479
Shizhen.

723
00:40:50,479 --> 00:40:51,080
Shixun.

724
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,840
Let me take the suitcase.

725
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,600
Okay.

726
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,360
Be careful.

727
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:55,250
How was it going?

728
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,250
It went well.

729
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,120
Sorry.

730
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:57,800
Something came up

731
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,560
and I couldn't leave.

732
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,600
I know you are busy.

733
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,560
It's okay.

734
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,760
Just treat me to something delicious.

735
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:02,479
Okay.

736
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,800
I'll buy you whatever you want.

737
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,199
Let's go to Wangfu Restaurant.

738
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:08,000
Wangfu Restaurant? Okay.

739
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,825
We can have a late night snack.

740
00:41:09,225 --> 00:41:10,650
But it's a little expensive there.

741
00:41:11,175 --> 00:41:12,150
For my little sister,

742
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,550
nothing is expensive for me.

743
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,050
Well,

744
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,919
Mr. Jiashang, you're back.

745
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:31,280
Miss Du is here.

746
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,679
She is playing Mahjong

747
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:35,040
with Master and madams.

748
00:41:35,825 --> 00:41:36,500
Okay.

749
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:46,250
Great.

750
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:49,719
Thank you, Aunt.

751
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,250
You ate it.

752
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,399
Father.

753
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,425
Mm.

754
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:58,469
Jiashang.

755
00:41:58,919 --> 00:41:59,719
Lanxin sent over

756
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:02,239
two cases of fine wine her father
brought back from Europe.

757
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:03,919
I know you are busy,

758
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:04,959
but no matter how busy you are,

759
00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:06,399
you should save some time
for your fiancée.

760
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,000
Men should be busy with their careers.

761
00:42:09,959 --> 00:42:12,000
Since Jiashang is back,
I won't play anymore.

762
00:42:12,959 --> 00:42:13,879
Aunt Wang.

763
00:42:13,879 --> 00:42:15,375
Please take it for me.

764
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:17,100
Yes.

765
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,925
I'll go with you to grab a late snack.

766
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:22,175
Okay.

767
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:32,875
Character five.

768
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,450
A complete sequence.

769
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,800
I've been playing Mahjong with them

770
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,975
since this afternoon.

771
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:51,159
My waist is gonna break

772
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,639
if you don't come back.

773
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:53,959
Why is Yang Xiucheng here?

774
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,800
He followed your father here.

775
00:42:56,879 --> 00:42:58,080
It has nothing to do with me.

776
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:02,600
Well,

777
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:04,639
Young Master Rong,

778
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:07,239
you can't even stand
his presence anymore?

779
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:09,391
After all,

780
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,360
the Rong family hurt him first.

781
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,550
I have no problem with him.
