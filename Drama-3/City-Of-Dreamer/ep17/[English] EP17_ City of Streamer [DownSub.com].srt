=Episode 17=

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,879
I don't care if they laugh or sweep.

4
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,249
I don't see any hope

5
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
in my own life.

6
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,239
Didn't Mr. Yang

7
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:53,275
come with you, Miss Yu?

8
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,700
He went to my home days ago.

9
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,839
My mother intimated to him

10
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:02,519
that we'd decide the wedding day.

11
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:08,000
I saw his eyes blinking

12
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,550
and I knew

13
00:02:16,275 --> 00:02:17,275
we are finished.

14
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,199
You know,

15
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,475
we'd been dodging his proposal

16
00:02:24,475 --> 00:02:25,500
before

17
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,025
I could find a better man.

18
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,500
But now…

19
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:33,039
I guess you are

20
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:35,279
in no hurry to marry, aren't you?

21
00:02:35,525 --> 00:02:37,039
No, I'm not.

22
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,559
But my family

23
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,609
is getting poorer.

24
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,100
You're a college graduate

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,600
and you can find a job.

26
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,475
Then what?

27
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,320
Be like you,

28
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:03,875
bowing before your boss

29
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,935
and getting harassed from time to time

30
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:09,000
by your young master?

31
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,825
You drank too much.

32
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,559
I'll ask them to take you home.

33
00:03:16,775 --> 00:03:17,875
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,639
I'm sorry, Miss Feng.

35
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,600
I'm sorry. I drank too much.

36
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:23,360
I shouldn't have said that. Sorry.

37
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:24,880
Don't be angry at me, please.

38
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,125
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

40
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:29,850
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:30,769
Stop drinking.

42
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:32,759
Go home, Miss Yu.

43
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,800
I don't want to go home.

44
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:39,000
I like here. I don't want to go.

45
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,399
I don't want to go home.

46
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,800
No! No!

47
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,119
If you like here,

48
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,679
the door is open to you.

49
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:50,615
If I go home now,

50
00:03:54,775 --> 00:03:56,935
I'll never come out.

51
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,600
What happened?

52
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:03,205
Can I help you?

53
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:11,625
My brother owes someone five thousand.

54
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,180
My family can never afford that.

55
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,551
But the creditor says...

56
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,275
He says

57
00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:22,085
if I marry him,

58
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,519
he'll divorce his countryside wife

59
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,160
and put our marriage on paper.

60
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:31,799
But you know,

61
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,720
his eldest son

62
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,025
is at the age of Jiashang.

63
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,920
I don't want it.

64
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,680
I don't want to be a stepmother
in that family.

65
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:46,470
No.

66
00:04:46,775 --> 00:04:48,880
Does Mr. Yang know this?

67
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,650
He does.

68
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,640
He declines to marry me

69
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,880
because of this.

70
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,440
In the past few years,

71
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,940
he helped us pay the debt.

72
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,510
To be honest, I…

73
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,650
I feel guilty about him.

74
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:12,119
But it's five thousand.

75
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,880
It's a huge amount

76
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,799
even for him.

77
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,239
Last time, he went to my home

78
00:05:20,325 --> 00:05:22,085
and gave us 300,

79
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:24,750
then

80
00:05:29,425 --> 00:05:31,625
he ran away like a refugee.

81
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,000
I know it.

82
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,359
He will never come to my door again.

83
00:05:39,225 --> 00:05:40,306
In this case,

84
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,475
if you can't go through it,

85
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,320
is it possible to ask
Mrs. Rong for help?

86
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,839
But it's five thousand!

87
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,239
Aunt can help with up to hundreds.

88
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,040
All the Rongs' money

89
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,239
is in my uncle's hand.

90
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,225
Yeah.

91
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,275
Uncle.

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,760
Well,

93
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,519
can I ask Uncle for help?

94
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:15,239
Uncle… Uncle always

95
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:16,720
shows a poker face.

96
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,640
But I can feel it.

97
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,720
Uncle cares about me.

98
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,399
I said I didn't have a dancing dress

99
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,025
and he let me pick one in the West Hall.

100
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:25,940
Right?

101
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,799
You know what,

102
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:32,175
when I lodged here,

103
00:06:32,275 --> 00:06:33,275
I was thinking

104
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:35,660
why this wasn't my home.

105
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,050
Yes,

106
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,600
I'm going to Uncle for help.

107
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,640
I'm going to him now.

108
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,279
Miss Yu.

109
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,700
I'm going to him now.

110
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,799
You're drunk.

111
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,399
I advise

112
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,399
you don't do anything

113
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,359
before you sober up.

114
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,760
Miss Feng,

115
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,720
please,

116
00:07:08,775 --> 00:07:09,875
please,

117
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,079
could you bring my uncle here?

118
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,850
I can't wait till tomorrow.

119
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,559
Please.

120
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,359
Please, do me a favor.

121
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:22,959
Please.

122
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,300
Alright.

123
00:07:28,675 --> 00:07:29,515
I'll help you.

124
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,630
Do not drink anymore.

125
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,925
Have a rest.

126
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:18,169
Your decision concerns a woman's fate.

127
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,705
Miss Feng,

128
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,559
there was a Mr. Feng looking for you.

129
00:08:37,825 --> 00:08:39,250
Is that Mr. Feng

130
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,180
your brother?

131
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,610
He's my brother.

132
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,850
Where is he?

133
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,009
He's in the garden.

134
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:53,800
Thank you, Mr. Meng.

135
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:55,475
My pleasure.

136
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,075
Dr. Feng,

137
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:12,239
my baby still doesn't sleep well
at night.

138
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,440
He often wakes up and cries.

139
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,119
I've tried everything.

140
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:17,280
What shall I do?

141
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:18,679
Well,

142
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,559
he needs a blood test in the hospital.

143
00:09:21,239 --> 00:09:22,200
Alright.

144
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,159
When will you be in the office?

145
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,039
I'll go for you.

146
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,125
I take night shift this week.

147
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,679
You may visit my colleagues.

148
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,200
They graduated from medical colleges

149
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:31,440
and are experienced doctors.

150
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,559
I don't want them.

151
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,039
I mean

152
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:37,150
you delivered my baby

153
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,400
and you know him better.

154
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,559
I'll bring my baby to you.

155
00:09:39,675 --> 00:09:40,325
Shixun.

156
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,675
Shizhen.

157
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:45,950
Shixun.

158
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,650
Concubine Sun.

159
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,144
I was in the kitchen

160
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,960
and saw Mr. Feng looking for you.

161
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:56,000
So I showed him the way.

162
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,875
You know it's a huge place here.

163
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,200
I'm afraid he'll get lost.

164
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,950
I appreciate your help.

165
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,725
You're welcome.

166
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,799
You found her. I'll leave you then.

167
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:06,125
Have a good time.

168
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,719
- Have a good time.
- Mm.

169
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,175
Shixun.

170
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,760
The maidservants

171
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,039
are gossipers.

172
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,200
Behave yourself,

173
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,799
or you'll be a target.

174
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:20,919
Yes,

175
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:21,760
I got that.

176
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,385
Mm.

177
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:23,719
And you,

178
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:24,719
where were you?

179
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,719
I was looking for you around this place.

180
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,440
I…

181
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,919
A guest got drunk.

182
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,475
I went to help her.

183
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:33,799
You…

184
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,800
Shizhen,

185
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,400
we are guests today.

186
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,520
Why did you do the host's job?

187
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:41,850
Note this,

188
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:43,280
you work here.

189
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:45,280
You're not sold to the Rongs.

190
00:10:46,325 --> 00:10:47,965
Okay, Shixun.

191
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,239
I got it.

192
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,450
Fine.

193
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,119
It's late.

194
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,159
I'll get back to the hospital.

195
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:54,925
I'll walk you out.

196
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:55,760
- Go.
- Okay.

197
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,799
Let's cooperate.

198
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,101
Yes, Mr. Rong.

199
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,625
Nice to see you, Mr. Meng.

200
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:03,799
You are…?

201
00:11:04,119 --> 00:11:05,080
My name is Wang.

202
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,359
I run Xindong Shopping Mall in the west.

203
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:08,080
Oh.

204
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,440
We had dinner in Fengyinglou
last month.

205
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,400
You remember?

206
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,960
Mr. Wang.

207
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,760
My apology.

208
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,719
Nice to see you.

209
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:15,425
Nice to see you.

210
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:17,919
I didn't know you're Mr. Rong's friend.

211
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,320
What a surprise.

212
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,119
Yeah,

213
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:21,320
I've known Mr. Rong

214
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,880
for more than ten years.

215
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:30,119
We may spend some time together.

216
00:11:30,675 --> 00:11:31,425
Sure.

217
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,919
Excuse me.

218
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:33,640
Excuse me.

219
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:36,475
Have fun.

220
00:11:36,475 --> 00:11:37,250
Mr. Rong.

221
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,675
Well,

222
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:44,845
just now I saw a girl

223
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,300
who seemed drunk,

224
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,200
and went to the saloon
with a glass of wine.

225
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:51,080
Judging from her profile,

226
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,500
she is your daughter.

227
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,559
I'm not so sure.

228
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:58,919
Maybe she's not her.

229
00:11:58,919 --> 00:11:59,625
Excuse me.

230
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,825
Zhihui.

231
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,200
Zhihui.

232
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,600
Are you alright?

233
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:00,799
You drank too much.

234
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,029
Uncle.

235
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,075
Don't be angry with me.

236
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
I drank too much.

237
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:15,025
A girl shouldn't drink too much.

238
00:13:17,725 --> 00:13:19,910
I was a bit upset

239
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,250
and drank a bit more.

240
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,760
What makes you upset? Tell me.

241
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,139
Uncle,

242
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:33,159
do you know

243
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,799
why Xiucheng is so cruel to me?

244
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:41,200
Is it because I'm not good enough?

245
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,710
Xiucheng is too young

246
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:45,875
to settle down.

247
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,679
Alright, don't cry.

248
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:51,760
If you cry your eyes out,

249
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,150
your aunt will feel sad for you.

250
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,200
Tell me

251
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:55,919
why young men

252
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,800
are so unreliable?

253
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,039
Why can't they be as mature

254
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:04,475
and steady as you?

255
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:09,760
I've seen the world

256
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,025
because I'm older.

257
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:22,800
Nobody understands me.

258
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,919
Nobody.

259
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:28,719
Alright. Alright.

260
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,950
I understand you.

261
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:37,559
If anything bothers you,

262
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:38,960
just come to me,

263
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:39,880
alright?

264
00:14:40,119 --> 00:14:41,799
Don't cry.

265
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,039
Talk to me.

266
00:14:49,075 --> 00:14:51,525
Uncle, you're so sweet.

267
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,244
You make me

268
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:59,200
fear of nothing.

269
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,325
Zhihui,

270
00:15:04,725 --> 00:15:06,045
Xiucheng let you down.

271
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:07,919
He doesn't deserve you.

272
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:09,900
Don't worry,

273
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,359
I will look after you.

274
00:15:19,025 --> 00:15:20,175
Uncle,

275
00:15:24,119 --> 00:15:27,359
I wish Xiucheng is as nice as you are.

276
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,679
You've grown up.

277
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,391
I wish…

278
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,725
I wish I'd never grow up.

279
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:51,960
I wish

280
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:55,075
I'd always rely on you.

281
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:01,050
Uncle,

282
00:16:01,325 --> 00:16:02,965
have some wine.

283
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,559
I'm sorry, Uncle.

284
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:30,650
Qingzhi,

285
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,425
you're back.

286
00:16:36,025 --> 00:16:36,750
Mm.

287
00:16:38,825 --> 00:16:40,080
Don't go.

288
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,000
I'll never let you go.

289
00:16:44,475 --> 00:16:45,595
I promise

290
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,200
I'll divorce and marry you.

291
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,275
Mm.

292
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,560
You look beautiful.

293
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,025
Fanglin.

294
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,250
Mother.

295
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,900
Your grandaunt is leaving.

296
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,680
I'm busy here.

297
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,950
Walk her out, please.

298
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:25,200
Yes.

299
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,119
Mr. Meng,

300
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,119
Fanglin is too young

301
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:38,239
to be a friend of someone like you.

302
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,400
Please stay away from her.

303
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:43,800
Since Mrs. Rong has asked,

304
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,975
I will

305
00:17:44,975 --> 00:17:47,055
stay away from your daughter.

306
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,800
A man like me

307
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,560
has a bad name,

308
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,280
but

309
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,520
I won't go as far as

310
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,160
to harass a Rongs' lady.

311
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,100
Ah, excuse me,

312
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,920
may I ask about someone?

313
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,300
Who?

314
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,050
Your governess.

315
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,675
Where did you find her?

316
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:08,275
She?

317
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,200
A friend recommended her.

318
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,079
She's good at teaching.

319
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:16,160
Is her job teaching?

320
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:18,599
I think

321
00:18:19,525 --> 00:18:21,975
Mr. Rong likes her.

322
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,745
Watch your language.

323
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,400
Mrs. Rong is angry.

324
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:37,200
I'm sorry.

325
00:18:56,725 --> 00:18:58,319
Hey, Mr. Jiashang,

326
00:19:00,525 --> 00:19:01,850
congratulations!

327
00:19:02,525 --> 00:19:03,565
Happy birthday!

328
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,520
Thank you.

329
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:07,100
When did you come back to Shanghai?

330
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,201
Early this year.

331
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,075
Oh.

332
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,525
Ms. Chen.

333
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,075
Yes.

334
00:19:14,285 --> 00:19:15,025
Ma'am.

335
00:19:15,025 --> 00:19:16,119
Did you see Miss Feng?

336
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:16,975
No,

337
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,400
not when Mr. Jiashang cut the cake.

338
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,175
Bring Concubine Wang here.

339
00:19:23,444 --> 00:19:24,119
Yes.

340
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:25,125
Go! Go!

341
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,125
Ma'am.

342
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,100
Good to see you.

343
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,560
Bring someone

344
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,275
and come with me.

345
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,625
Hey,

346
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:33,975
you, come here!

347
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:42,359
Jiashang,

348
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,631
your father wants a talk with us.

349
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,681
Yes.

350
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,119
Ms. Kang, come with me.

351
00:19:49,275 --> 00:19:50,079
Ma'am.

352
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:52,725
Mr. Jiashang.

353
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,090
Master, you really can't wait for it.

354
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,929
Miss Feng's brother is here.

355
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:07,275
If he knows this,

356
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:08,289
what will…

357
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,900
What happened here?

358
00:20:21,746 --> 00:20:23,825
How dare you! You animal!

359
00:20:23,825 --> 00:20:24,920
You animal!

360
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,088
- Ma'am!
- She's your niece!

361
00:20:26,348 --> 00:20:27,760
How dare you!

362
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,719
She's your niece! How dare you!

363
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:31,175
I never force a woman!

364
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,450
Did I ever harm you?

365
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,909
I brought you up and fed you!

366
00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:50,225
I paid your debts!

367
00:20:50,475 --> 00:20:52,434
How can you do this to me?

368
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,200
You slut!

369
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,199
You slut!

370
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:56,375
You slut!

371
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,495
Aunt!

372
00:20:58,075 --> 00:20:59,319
- I paid your debts!
- Aunt!

373
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:01,075
Is this how you repay me?

374
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,665
You slut!

375
00:21:03,665 --> 00:21:05,199
You need a man this much?

376
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:06,640
You slut!

377
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,880
He's your uncle!

378
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,399
- You ungrateful soul!
- I didn't seduce Uncle!

379
00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:13,880
- You traitor!
- He was drunk!

380
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,520
He called a name like Zhi!

381
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:19,160
I didn't seduce him!

382
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,920
I couldn't get rid of him!

383
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,719
Aunt,

384
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:24,439
I was about to bite my tongue

385
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:25,275
and kill myself.

386
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,439
Qingzhi?

387
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:31,479
Open your eyes and look at her.

388
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:33,719
She's your niece!

389
00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:35,175
We have many guests here.

390
00:21:35,175 --> 00:21:36,359
You want this to go public?

391
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,200
I know we have guests.

392
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:37,900
You…!

393
00:21:38,225 --> 00:21:39,175
You…you!

394
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,125
What are you doing?

395
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,950
Listen, Rong Dingkun!

396
00:21:44,325 --> 00:21:45,764
I will divorce you.

397
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,751
I can't afford this scandal!

398
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:49,599
Ma'am, calm down.

399
00:21:51,075 --> 00:21:52,119
Aunt!

400
00:21:53,425 --> 00:21:55,144
Aunt! It's my fault.

401
00:21:55,925 --> 00:21:57,445
If I'm gone,

402
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,540
will you and Uncle be alright?

403
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,950
And I won't be a burden on my family.

404
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:08,149
I'd better die!

405
00:22:08,275 --> 00:22:10,600
Let me die!

406
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,450
My poor girl!

407
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,640
Why did this happen to you?

408
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,920
How are you going to get married?

409
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,040
Mr. Rong,

410
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:26,239
Zhihui is an untouched decent girl!

411
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,199
What…

412
00:22:28,275 --> 00:22:29,425
I didn't touch her!

413
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,861
Mr. Rong,

414
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,975
how could you say that?

415
00:22:33,225 --> 00:22:34,439
If this goes public,

416
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:36,238
how will Zhihui live?

417
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,560
We're a small family though,

418
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,840
we have a decent name.

419
00:22:41,175 --> 00:22:41,959
What…!

420
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:42,775
A decent name?

421
00:22:44,425 --> 00:22:47,160
A girl under a decent name
doesn't get drunk in other's home.

422
00:22:48,275 --> 00:22:49,155
Be reminded,

423
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,475
your decent name is in debt.

424
00:22:56,925 --> 00:22:59,525
Leave me alone!

425
00:22:59,525 --> 00:23:01,175
Let me die!

426
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,875
Zhihui!

427
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:03,625
Leave me alone!

428
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:04,985
Zhihui, calm down!

429
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,879
Out, all of you.

430
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:37,950
Close the door.

431
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,944
Haven't you heard me?

432
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,330
Out!

433
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:46,439
Let's go.

434
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,680
Go, go.

435
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:55,605
Mrs. Yu,

436
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:00,725
how did you know what happened here?

437
00:24:03,425 --> 00:24:05,346
A gentleman came to me

438
00:24:05,346 --> 00:24:07,226
and said someone was bullying Zhihui.

439
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,680
So I...

440
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,320
Mr. Meng, the latecomer?

441
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,400
Yes.

442
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,125
It was him.

443
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,406
It was the handsome…

444
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,000
Zhihui,

445
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:20,160
are you alright, Zhihui?

446
00:24:41,775 --> 00:24:43,119
Uncle.

447
00:24:44,175 --> 00:24:45,175
I'm afraid

448
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:47,554
Mr. Meng planned all this.

449
00:24:50,475 --> 00:24:52,275
And he enjoys the plan.

450
00:25:01,275 --> 00:25:02,635
Zhihui,

451
00:25:05,025 --> 00:25:07,145
what did Meng Xu'an tell you?

452
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,250
He teased me

453
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:15,350
that I borrowed the dress and jewelry.

454
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,000
Uncle,

455
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:21,335
you believe I colluded with someone

456
00:25:21,335 --> 00:25:22,800
to frame you?

457
00:25:27,675 --> 00:25:29,476
We're clean of that!

458
00:25:29,476 --> 00:25:31,375
We're not such kind of people

459
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,101
Mr. Rong,

460
00:25:33,225 --> 00:25:34,175
you're a man.

461
00:25:34,175 --> 00:25:35,400
A man doesn't

462
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,359
shift the blame on a woman!

463
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,640
Shall I

464
00:25:46,325 --> 00:25:47,875
send them home now?

465
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,160
No way!

466
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,120
This is not the end.

467
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:53,880
Our Zhihui

468
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,450
is a clean decent girl.

469
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,300
You stained her name.

470
00:25:57,525 --> 00:25:59,805
You have to make it up.

471
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,391
Stop it.

472
00:26:04,275 --> 00:26:05,025
Let's go.

473
00:26:05,025 --> 00:26:05,800
Zhihui!

474
00:26:06,325 --> 00:26:07,479
We can't go!

475
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,079
Zhihui!

476
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,719
Zhihui!

477
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,079
Zhihui!

478
00:26:13,175 --> 00:26:13,934
Hold on.

479
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,839
Take this.

480
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:41,839
Take it.

481
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:44,385
Why?

482
00:26:45,725 --> 00:26:47,119
Will you wear

483
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:48,280
a borrowed dress throughout your life?

484
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,481
Zhihui!

485
00:27:00,225 --> 00:27:01,040
Zhihui!

486
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,959
Zhihui!

487
00:27:05,425 --> 00:27:06,760
You're too young

488
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,439
to take care of the money.

489
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:09,965
Zhihui!

490
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:31,534
If there's nothing else,

491
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:33,825
I'll excuse myself.

492
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:48,816
What a shame!

493
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,250
What a good dog!

494
00:28:59,825 --> 00:29:00,825
Mr. Meng,

495
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:04,725
you're not welcomed here.

496
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:08,200
Please leave.

497
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:16,925
Sure.

498
00:29:26,925 --> 00:29:27,845
Goodbye.

499
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:27,134
You're really someone,

500
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:28,644
Zhihui.

501
00:30:28,925 --> 00:30:29,726
Why?

502
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,800
Uncle's check makes you unhappy?

503
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:37,531
Maybe you're not clear of

504
00:30:38,325 --> 00:30:39,725
what kind of person my father is.

505
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:42,560
If he knows you used him,

506
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,431
he'll get back at you.

507
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:51,599
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

508
00:30:53,175 --> 00:30:55,055
I don't mean to make trouble.

509
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,000
You must have done this

510
00:30:58,725 --> 00:31:00,365
out of desperation.

511
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,175
Since you're my cousin,

512
00:31:03,175 --> 00:31:04,175
I should warn you

513
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:05,894
that you'd better leave Shanghai.

514
00:31:07,975 --> 00:31:10,055
My father won't kill a woman.

515
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,911
He does something worse.

516
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:15,760
You're smart, Zhihui,

517
00:31:16,325 --> 00:31:17,719
and you know what to do.

518
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:21,199
The driver will drive you home.

519
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,375
Zhihui.

520
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,975
May I ask a question?

521
00:31:38,425 --> 00:31:40,065
Why did Ma'am think it was Miss Feng?

522
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,040
I don't know.

523
00:31:44,425 --> 00:31:46,600
Perhaps Miss Feng brought Uncle there.

524
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:06,700
Why was it her?

525
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,150
Jiashang.

526
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,525
What are you doing here?

527
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,780
Get in.

528
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,921
It's windy out here.

529
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:35,375
Wait!

530
00:32:35,925 --> 00:32:37,165
I have a word with you,

531
00:32:37,439 --> 00:32:39,880
since there's nobody around.

532
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,109
Go ahead.

533
00:32:54,525 --> 00:32:56,244
Congratulations on your engagement.

534
00:32:57,625 --> 00:33:00,904
Miss Du's pretty and has a decent name.

535
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,950
I envy her.

536
00:33:06,675 --> 00:33:08,475
We've parted for half a year or more,

537
00:33:09,175 --> 00:33:11,175
from early spring to late fall.

538
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,170
I miss you every single day,

539
00:33:17,075 --> 00:33:19,950
hoping I'll see you again.

540
00:33:23,225 --> 00:33:24,585
This is not

541
00:33:24,925 --> 00:33:26,805
as I imagined though,

542
00:33:28,425 --> 00:33:30,575
at least we meet again.

543
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,020
Yes.

544
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,719
It's not as I imagined, either.

545
00:33:40,425 --> 00:33:41,386
Jiashang,

546
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:45,025
I've never asked you.

547
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,640
Did you really love me

548
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,150
when we were in Chongqing?

549
00:33:52,825 --> 00:33:54,675
I thought that

550
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,999
it was love,

551
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,730
but until now did I realize

552
00:34:04,425 --> 00:34:05,350
it was not.

553
00:34:09,525 --> 00:34:10,639
But Jiashang,

554
00:34:14,975 --> 00:34:16,495
I didn't know until now

555
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:18,900
that I love you.

556
00:34:22,825 --> 00:34:23,760
Shizhi,

557
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,439
please don't.

558
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,959
We are over.

559
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,025
You don't know my heart.

560
00:34:41,825 --> 00:34:42,545
I promise

561
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,200
I won't disturb you.

562
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:48,665
We may not be lovers,

563
00:34:48,975 --> 00:34:51,175
but we can be friends, can't we?

564
00:34:57,775 --> 00:34:58,550
Jiashang,

565
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,761
you haven't changed at all.

566
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,225
(Shanghai Guohua Bank)

567
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:18,879
It's good to see you.

568
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,919
Have you heard it?

569
00:36:21,175 --> 00:36:22,025
Yesterday

570
00:36:22,025 --> 00:36:23,344
something happened in Rong's Residence.

571
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:25,479
What happened?

572
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,111
Don't you know?

573
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,800
What's the story?

574
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:31,225
I'm not so sure about the details.

575
00:36:31,225 --> 00:36:31,925
I have my work to do.

576
00:36:31,925 --> 00:36:33,845
That's it for today.

577
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:34,761
Alright.

578
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,600
Alright.

579
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,450
(VIP)

580
00:36:40,775 --> 00:36:42,050
Hey, Miss,

581
00:36:42,525 --> 00:36:44,006
this is the VIP counter.

582
00:36:44,006 --> 00:36:46,040
For regular business, queue over there.

583
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,320
I'm cashing a check.

584
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,560
Am I

585
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,230
coming to the right place?

586
00:36:55,725 --> 00:36:56,719
Yes. Yes.

587
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:57,639
You are.

588
00:36:57,639 --> 00:36:59,478
(VIP)
Are you cashing the full amount?

589
00:36:59,825 --> 00:37:00,520
Yes.

590
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,375
All of it.

591
00:37:01,475 --> 00:37:02,394
Alright.

592
00:37:03,175 --> 00:37:04,199
Cash it all.

593
00:37:04,475 --> 00:37:05,560
Oh, yes.

594
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,891
Your 10,000. Take it, please.

595
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,399
Hello.

596
00:37:34,399 --> 00:37:35,439
Open an account

597
00:37:35,439 --> 00:37:36,479
to deposit these, please.

598
00:37:36,479 --> 00:37:37,125
Thank you.

599
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:37,925
Sure.

600
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,959
Here's your bank book.

601
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:50,720
Thank you.

602
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,089
It's early in the morning.

603
00:38:08,825 --> 00:38:10,600
Good boy. Good boy.

604
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,439
Come.

605
00:38:11,439 --> 00:38:13,199
What's the noise?

606
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:14,719
Good boy, don't cry.

607
00:38:17,575 --> 00:38:18,879
What did you say?

608
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:22,375
Miss Yu

609
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:23,600
who's always quiet?

610
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,320
Yes.

611
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,425
I was also surprised

612
00:38:25,425 --> 00:38:26,639
it was her.

613
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:28,100
The maidservants gossiped

614
00:38:28,325 --> 00:38:29,439
that at first Ma'am

615
00:38:29,439 --> 00:38:30,840
thought it was Miss Feng,

616
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,399
but it turned out to be her niece.

617
00:38:37,075 --> 00:38:38,080
The reward

618
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,719
for what she's done!

619
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,560
Miss Feng?

620
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,300
He's not even her type.

621
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,150
No.

622
00:38:45,275 --> 00:38:46,634
I wish I'd seen

623
00:38:46,634 --> 00:38:48,755
Huang Shujun's face.

624
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,350
It's a scandal,

625
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:52,150
and a shame on the family name.

626
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,989
In no time,

627
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,925
the Huangs will be famous

628
00:38:56,925 --> 00:38:58,405
in Shanghai.

629
00:38:58,405 --> 00:38:59,639
Yes.

630
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:02,080
She slapped Miss Yu

631
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,520
so hard in the face.

632
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,959
She threw good money after bad.

633
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,719
Oh,

634
00:39:09,025 --> 00:39:10,185
what did Master say?

635
00:39:10,275 --> 00:39:11,840
Would he have another concubine?

636
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,480
Master was embarrassed.

637
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,360
He didn't say much.

638
00:39:14,625 --> 00:39:16,750
He gave Miss Yu a check and let her go.

639
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:21,120
He just let her go?

640
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,000
He might have done it after drinking,

641
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,199
and doesn't want to
take the responsibility.

642
00:39:26,475 --> 00:39:27,755
It's good to let her go,

643
00:39:27,755 --> 00:39:29,560
or another woman will steal my thunder.

644
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,159
He let her go

645
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:35,560
and what was she wild for?

646
00:39:35,775 --> 00:39:37,200
She embarrassed Master.

647
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:38,865
It's not Ma'am.

648
00:39:38,865 --> 00:39:40,239
Master sobered up

649
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:41,199
and went to Ma'am.

650
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,120
Go on!

651
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,280
The worse, the better.

652
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:47,679
Wretch!

653
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,919
I noticed something's not right!

654
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,719
Why did she

655
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:54,225
put on Qingzhi's dress?

656
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,959
She got drunk on purpose

657
00:39:55,959 --> 00:39:57,479
and waited for me in the small saloon.

658
00:39:58,919 --> 00:40:00,875
You have a good niece!

659
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:03,811
Don't shift the blame on me.

660
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:06,120
You were obsessed with her!

661
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:07,199
What?

662
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:09,399
I was obsessed?

663
00:40:09,399 --> 00:40:10,599
How ridiculous!

664
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,280
Ask your niece

665
00:40:13,919 --> 00:40:16,450
who fell to my arms when I was drunk.

666
00:40:17,325 --> 00:40:19,239
Haven't I kept a cool head,

667
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:21,360
you'd have seen something worse.

668
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:22,890
Huang Shujun,

669
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,600
ask your heart and tell me,

670
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,520
have I ever mistreated your family?

671
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,439
I look after

672
00:40:31,439 --> 00:40:32,800
all of your relatives!

673
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,159
And you collude and set me up!

674
00:40:35,875 --> 00:40:37,355
You're always right!

675
00:40:37,959 --> 00:40:39,439
What about me?

676
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:41,520
I didn't know it was her.

677
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:43,040
If I did,

678
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,080
I wouldn't have brought so many people.

679
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,239
I wouldn't do that

680
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:48,159
to stain my own name!

681
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:50,199
It was you, I knew it!

682
00:40:50,575 --> 00:40:51,815
Huang Shujun,

683
00:40:53,025 --> 00:40:55,545
you kicked Qingzhi out of the house.

684
00:40:55,925 --> 00:40:58,044
Wasn't it for the sake of Jiaxin,

685
00:40:58,325 --> 00:40:59,925
I'd fallen out with you.

686
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:01,310
And what about now?

687
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,525
Are you destroying the Rongs' name?

688
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,375
I... I… I'm not.

689
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:06,425
I... I…

690
00:41:06,425 --> 00:41:07,665
Don't say one more word!

691
00:41:09,475 --> 00:41:10,555
From now on,

692
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:13,479
