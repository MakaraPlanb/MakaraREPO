3
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,559
Most people think

4
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:41,279
Australia is desolate, barbarous,
and sparsely populated.

5
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,319
But in Australia,

6
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,239
the vast land

7
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,120
is suitable for livestock grazing.

8
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:46,080
A terrific amount of wool
is produced every year.

9
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,800
It's cheap, but of good quality.

10
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,150
In my opinion, we can import

11
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,400
a large order of wool from Australia,

12
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,239
find cheap factories in Nanyang

13
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,360
for rough processing

14
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,000
and then transport it back for sale.

15
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,181
The profits will be considerable.

16
00:02:01,525 --> 00:02:03,239
Our company

17
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,720
has a route to the north.

18
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,279
If we form a partnership

19
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:08,520
and complement each other,

20
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,919
how nice it would be!

21
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,119
Good idea.

22
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:14,279
You want to develop Nanyang route

23
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:15,866
while we want

24
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:18,479
to develop the route to the north.

25
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,720
We quite coincide with each other

26
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,825
in doing business.

27
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,240
Like father, like son.

28
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,520
Your son is a brilliant successor.

29
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,775
I'm afraid you can retire early

30
00:02:31,775 --> 00:02:33,225
and enjoy a happy life ever after.

31
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,775
Let's do it in the Chinese way.

32
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,589
Hope we'll have a good cooperation.

33
00:02:40,175 --> 00:02:42,335
Jiashang, it's been a long time
since we last met.

34
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:43,639
I remember when you were in Chongqing,

35
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,720
you were quite bad-tempered.

36
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,479
But today, you sweet-talked my father.

37
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:48,950
Back in Shanghai,
I've got more experienced

38
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,520
and I've restrained myself more.

39
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,119
My sister has been thinking of you.

40
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:55,850
Why don't you get back together?

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,250
My relationship with Shiori is gone.

42
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:01,800
Everything is possible.

43
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,050
Look.

44
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,425
She has been waiting for you there

45
00:03:05,425 --> 00:03:06,375
for quite a while.

46
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:07,759
All right.

47
00:03:07,925 --> 00:03:09,005
Have a nice talk.

48
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:22,125
Jiashang,

49
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,080
you saw the Gold Kylin.

50
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:26,960
Is it the one you're looking for?

51
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,580
Your father treasures the Gold Kylin.

52
00:03:30,075 --> 00:03:31,479
I offered a high price for it,

53
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,559
but he rejected me immediately.

54
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,559
That's for sure.

55
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,179
Father always thinks

56
00:03:36,179 --> 00:03:38,300
the Gold Kylin is the talisman
for my eldest brother.

57
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:40,199
He won't sell it to you

58
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,525
unless my eldest brother is dead.

59
00:03:43,675 --> 00:03:44,755
Do you really

60
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:46,434
want it so much?

61
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,725
Forget it.

62
00:03:48,825 --> 00:03:49,825
After all,

63
00:03:50,075 --> 00:03:51,350
a gentleman doesn't
snatch things from others.

64
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,000
Jiashang,

65
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,700
I promised

66
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,759
that I would help you.

67
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,425
Help me?

68
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,450
Your father treasures the Gold Kylin.

69
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,399
How are you going to help me?

70
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,119
You and I

71
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,839
were in a relationship.

72
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,600
Now, I'm the daughter
of the Hashimoto family.

73
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,320
As long as you call off
your engagement with Miss Du,

74
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,880
I'll persuade my father

75
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,250
to marry me to you
with the Gold Kylin as my dowry.

76
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,975
Your eldest brother can't live
without the Gold Kylin.

77
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,375
How can you persuade your father?

78
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:27,600
My brother

79
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,200
will not live much longer.

80
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,475
He was born with serious heart disease.

81
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:36,760
According to the doctor,
he can't be cured without a new heart.

82
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,359
But in this world,

83
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:39,959
there isn't such a miracle
of medical science.

84
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,720
Today, he struggled to meet the guests.

85
00:04:42,925 --> 00:04:45,175
Usually, he can't even get off the bed.

86
00:04:45,901 --> 00:04:47,300
Otherwise, my brother and I

87
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,480
wouldn't have been taken back,

88
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,650
after we were expelled.

89
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:53,066
Ma'am has found a new doctor

90
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:54,147
with excellent medical skills.

91
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,600
After taking the new medicine,

92
00:04:56,675 --> 00:04:58,275
my brother managed to get off the bed.

93
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,600
But I don't think

94
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,075
he will live

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,280
much longer.

96
00:05:07,325 --> 00:05:08,500
Shiori,

97
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,359
I used to think

98
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:11,950
you were a pure and kind girl.

99
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,525
But now,

100
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,000
I realize I'm wrong about you.

101
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,851
Are you saying

102
00:05:34,225 --> 00:05:36,575
we'll wait
until Shiori's eldest brother dies?

103
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,975
According to her,

104
00:05:39,225 --> 00:05:41,184
he won't live much longer.

105
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,679
After he dies,

106
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,320
his father no longer needs

107
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,400
to keep the Gold Kylin.

108
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,920
We can then offer a high price for it.

109
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,300
I don't think he'll reject us.

110
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,279
Why don't we wait a little bit longer?

111
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,119
Don't trust Shiori.

112
00:05:55,575 --> 00:05:57,575
He was said to die before he turned 15.

113
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,900
But he's still alive.

114
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,900
Now, he's said to die
before the Spring Festival.

115
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,375
But maybe he'll survive

116
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,215
for another decade.

117
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,250
Waiting for someone's death
is like waiting for the rain.

118
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,839
If it rains whenever we want it,

119
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,950
what's the point of digging wells?

120
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,341
Are you saying

121
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,399
we'll get the Gold Kylin by ourselves?

122
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:24,600
Is Meng Xu'an urging us?

123
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,680
Did he set a deadline?

124
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,799
Now that we can't buy it

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,119
or wait for it,

126
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,480
we have to steal it

127
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,760
or grab it.

128
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:36,839
Hashimoto carefully protects
the Gold Kylin.

129
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,200
You witnessed that.

130
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,239
It's not only secretly kept,

131
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,679
but also guarded by private guards.

132
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:43,519
How can we steal or grab it?

133
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,000
Now that we know
it's in the hand of Hashimoto,

134
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,125
we'll manage to get it.

135
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,119

to clean the guest rooms.

141
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,025
Nothing.

188
00:10:19,275 --> 00:10:20,756
The ruins

189
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,620
are worthless

190
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,950
and the land is of little value.

191
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,750
You had quite a hard time.

192
00:10:28,175 --> 00:10:29,375
I can't imagine

193
00:10:29,525 --> 00:10:30,775
how you pulled through.

194
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,150
Shixun?

195
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:44,400
You're off the night shift?

196
00:10:44,525 --> 00:10:45,175
Mm.

197
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:47,425
I'm going to make bamboo shoot soup.

198
00:10:47,725 --> 00:10:49,125
It tastes best when it's hot.

199
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,325
Shizhen.

200
00:10:50,325 --> 00:10:50,975
Mm?

201
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,076
Why did you quit your job in advance?

202
00:10:55,425 --> 00:10:56,866
The admission list has been published.

203
00:10:56,866 --> 00:10:58,467
Miss Fanglin and Fanghua are admitted.

204
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,600
They no longer need me.

205
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:03,520
What about the last time?

206
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,640
Why did you quit last time?

207
00:11:05,675 --> 00:11:06,675
Last time?

208
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,679
It was because

209
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:11,080
Concubine Sun slandered me.

210
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,475
Then I quit my job.

211
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,250
Shixun,

212
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,675
why do you sound so weird?

213
00:11:23,025 --> 00:11:23,665
I don't.

214
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,805
Yesterday, Concubine Sun
came to the hospital.

215
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,625
Her son was sick.

216
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:31,710
He was?

217
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,470
What's wrong with him?

218
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:35,280
His fever wasn't gone
before I was off the night shift.

219
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:36,475
He's detained for observation.

220
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,760
Shizhen,

221
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,359
I've found a job for you in my hospital.

222
00:11:41,525 --> 00:11:42,564
Quite similar to your previous job.

223
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:44,880
Go to work with me tomorrow morning.

224
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,575
Shixun,

225
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,840
may I

226
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,191
think about it?

227
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,880
Hello.

228
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,799
Mr. Jiashang,

229
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,159
Miss Feng has left her home.

230
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,531
She's taking a rickshaw

231
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,650
to the church in Yang King Pang.

232
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:14,300
I get it.

233
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:14,760
Shizhen.

234
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,675
Shixun.

235
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,500
Why did you ask to see me here?

236
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,650
Why can't we talk at home?

237
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,175
Shixun,

238
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,960
I'm sorry.

239
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,125
You got me a job in the hospital.

240
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,359
But after I thought about it,

241
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:37,745
I decided not to take it.

242
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:43,900
Fine.

243
00:13:47,575 --> 00:13:48,414
But why?

244
00:13:51,025 --> 00:13:52,760
If I work in the hospital,

245
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,520
I'll only arrange files

246
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,875
or answer the phones.

247
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,940
It's way too boring.

248
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:58,991
It doesn't work for me.

249
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:02,559
What works for you, then?

250
00:14:04,075 --> 00:14:05,100
A job in the Rong family,

251
00:14:05,475 --> 00:14:07,525
as the governess for Rong Jiashang?

252
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,280
Shixun,

253
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,661
what makes you say that?

254
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:20,800
You think I don't know anything

255
00:14:22,175 --> 00:14:23,875
only because you haven't told me?

256
00:14:25,325 --> 00:14:26,400
When Concubine Sun took her son

257
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,599
to see the doctor the other day,

258
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,409
she told me what happened.

259
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,261
She told me
how Rong Jiashang harassed you

260
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,479
and how you were forced
to quit your job.

261
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,600
Shizhen,

262
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,239
you're good at keeping things from us.

263
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:39,750
Shixun...

264
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,071
Rong Jiashang

265
00:14:41,225 --> 00:14:42,704
is a playboy.

266
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,231
He only flirted with you for fun.

267
00:14:45,525 --> 00:14:46,846
You used to be sensible.

268
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,440
What's wrong with you now?

269
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:49,799
Are you insane?

270
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:50,960
Do you not want a good reputation?

271
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,640
Shixun,

272
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,975
you misunderstand
my relationship with him.

273
00:14:54,475 --> 00:14:56,200
I've quit my job already, right?

274
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,615
Trust me.

275
00:14:57,925 --> 00:14:58,725
Fine.

276
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,350
Do you refuse to work in the hospital

277
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,071
because you still want to go back
to the Rong family

278
00:15:04,175 --> 00:15:05,479
and stay with Rong Jiashang?

279
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:07,840
Do you still

280
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,919
have illusions for him?

281
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:10,644
Shixun,

282
00:15:11,225 --> 00:15:13,186
he and I are just friends.

283
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,036
He's a rich young man.

284
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:19,751
But you...

285
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,631
You're a poor governess.

286
00:15:25,575 --> 00:15:27,599
What kind of friends can you be?

287
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:32,159
The Rongs are going too far.

288
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,039
After he flirted with you,

289
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:34,900
he just let it go with a rough excuse.

290
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:36,814
I have to talk to him.

291
00:15:37,025 --> 00:15:38,789
What on earth does he take you for?

292
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:39,425
Shixun,

293
00:15:39,425 --> 00:15:40,400
don't be mad.

294
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,200
Listen to me.

295
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:42,400
I'm your brother.

296
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,320
You should listen to me!

297
00:15:46,575 --> 00:15:47,359
Shixun,

298
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,639
I feel

299
00:15:55,475 --> 00:15:56,756
that I've fallen in love with him.

300
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:10,000
What did you say?

301
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,950
I can't lie to you.

302
00:16:15,325 --> 00:16:16,950
I can't lie to myself, either.

303
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,831
But I indeed fell in love with him.

304
00:16:25,725 --> 00:16:27,400
I tried to stop,

305
00:16:28,025 --> 00:16:30,025
but I realized I couldn't.

306
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:36,760
I'm sorry.

307
00:16:37,719 --> 00:16:39,175
I know I shouldn't have loved him.

308
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,599
I've been adjusting my emotions.

309
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:43,840
But I...

310
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,799
Do you really think

311
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,719
the Rong family is respectable?

312
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,750
It's probably them

313
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,750
who set fire to Wenchunli!

314
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:55,750
Surprised?

315
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,329
When I heard about it,

316
00:16:58,329 --> 00:16:59,925
I was as surprised as you are now.

317
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:06,386
She really didn't know that.

318
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,300
Then she had no motive.

319
00:17:10,075 --> 00:17:11,850
But she knows everything now.

320
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:14,800
How did you know that?

321
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,225
Concubine Sun told me personally.

322
00:17:19,275 --> 00:17:20,300
You can refuse to believe that.

323
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,375
But I believe that.

324
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,199
The Rong family

325
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,975
is renovating Wenchunli.

326
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,979
Can't you figure out the reason?

327
00:17:31,225 --> 00:17:32,985
Think carefully about it, Shizhen.

328
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,500
I don't dare to think too much.

329
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:42,154
So, you suspected them?

330
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:46,369
What's worse,

331
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,040
Rong Jiashang has been engaged.

332
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,599
What are you going to do?

333
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:51,920
To be his concubine?

334
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,520
Shixun,

335
00:17:52,525 --> 00:17:53,900
I haven't thought about that.

336
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:56,199
Shizhen,

337
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,775
what's gotten into you?

338
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:00,575
What makes Rong Jiashang so attractive

339
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,854
that you keep sacrificing?

340
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,591
And his family...

341
00:18:04,675 --> 00:18:06,725
They knew you were from Wenchunli

342
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,400
but they still hired you.

343
00:18:09,975 --> 00:18:12,150
Rong Dingkun is quite crafty.

344
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,250
You're no match for him.

345
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,229
For your safety concern,

346
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:19,880
you must break with Rong Jiashang

347
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,075
and his family.

348
00:18:24,025 --> 00:18:24,865
All right.

349
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,550
I get it.

350
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,239
I'm going back to work.

351
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,225
Think carefully about it.

352
00:20:17,575 --> 00:20:18,575
Reverend,

353
00:20:20,175 --> 00:20:21,215
I want to confess.

354
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,486
God bless you.

355
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,610
I didn't know you came personally.

356
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,185
I haven't seen you for days.

357
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,800
I missed you.

358
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,520
They have left.

359
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:43,356
If you want to say something,

360
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:44,599
feel free to say it.

361
00:20:44,975 --> 00:20:45,975
Thank you, Boss.

362
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,520
I think

363
00:20:49,075 --> 00:20:50,716
I must tell you something.

364
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,611
It's about the Gold Kylin.

365
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,680
Rong Dingkun

366
00:20:56,325 --> 00:20:57,550
is quite cunning.

367
00:20:57,975 --> 00:20:59,400
He cut the horsehair.

368
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,360
But in this way,

369
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,875
it can't be sold at a high price.

370
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,075
Actually,

371
00:21:05,075 --> 00:21:07,034
it's not a priceless treasure.

372
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,839
It's just of great significance

373
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,949
to my family.

374
00:21:11,175 --> 00:21:13,935
It's said to be a burial article
of an emperor.

375
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,119
Elders of my family told me about it.

376
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,479
The Gold Kylin

377
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,169
is an auspicious thing

378
00:21:21,825 --> 00:21:23,585
that protects the family.

379
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,450
I heard my family lost it twice
in history.

380
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:30,850
Every time it was lost,
my family suffered a lot.

381
00:21:30,975 --> 00:21:33,015
Things didn't get better
until it was taken back.

382
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,250
Rong Dingkun

383
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,000
swindled my sister

384
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,400
of the Gold Kylin.

385
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,599
In my family,

386
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,249
accidents happened unexpectedly.

387
00:21:44,275 --> 00:21:46,155
My family members died or left.

388
00:21:46,925 --> 00:21:49,359
Our business suffered
a disastrous decline, too.

389
00:21:51,325 --> 00:21:52,680
But Boss,

390
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,700
you have prospered your family again

391
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:56,680
without the Gold Kylin.

392
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,359
It proves

393
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:01,150
that the prosperity of a family
counts on human efforts.

394
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,439
It also depends
on the talent of descendants

395
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:04,800
and the political situation.

396
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,319
My father and grandfather asked me

397
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:08,520
to get back the Gold Kylin

398
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,319
before they passed away.

399
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,350
Unexpectedly,

400
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,225
I didn't get any clues

401
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:15,906
until 17 years later.

402
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,560
It's filial of you, Boss.

403
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:21,625
By the way,

404
00:22:22,725 --> 00:22:24,190
are you sure

405
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,900
Rong Jiashang will do
what you expect him to do?

406
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,420
He's against Rong Dingkun all the time.

407
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,869
I've just made myself

408
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,880
one of his trophies.

409
00:22:38,575 --> 00:22:39,520
What kind of man

410
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,410
would fight his own father

411
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,119
for a woman only?

412
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,040
He will fight for nothing,

413
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,529
but his freedom and dream.

414
00:22:51,575 --> 00:22:53,850
But your brother misunderstands you.

415
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:56,119
Have you figured out
how to explain to him?

416
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,710
Thank you for your concern.

417
00:22:58,225 --> 00:22:59,465
As for my brother...

418
00:23:00,825 --> 00:23:02,425
I'll try to explain to him.

419
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,675
You...

420
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,750
Do you really like him so much?

421
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,141
Boss, if you don't mind,

422
00:23:18,825 --> 00:23:19,945
I'll take my leave.

423
00:23:47,675 --> 00:23:48,755
You don't have an appetite?

424
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:51,199
What?

425
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,200
After you're used to big meals
in the Rong family,

426
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,439
you don't want the simple food?

427
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,125
Big meals

428
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,560
made my stomach churn.

429
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,239
A young lady like me

430
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:03,880
feels best

431
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,000
to have such simple food.

432
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:07,959
What happened

433
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:09,300
between you?

434
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,119
Nothing, Father.

435
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:17,040
I rejected the job in the hospital.

436
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:18,880
Shixun felt disgraced

437
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,160
and he's being upset.

438
00:24:22,225 --> 00:24:23,920
The job in the hospital

439
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,650
is steady and decent.

440
00:24:25,975 --> 00:24:28,614
But your sister's will matters most.

441
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,079
Now,

442
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,000
our family

443
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:34,775
is finally getting together
after all the trouble.

444
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:37,119
Don't make more trouble.

445
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:37,825
Mm.

446
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,280
- I won't, Father.
- I won't, Father.

447
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:42,400
By the way,

448
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,880
now that you don't want
to work in the hospital,

449
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,500
what kind of job would you like?

450
00:24:47,775 --> 00:24:50,414
It's not easy to find a job
before the Spring Festival.

451
00:24:50,744 --> 00:24:51,825
But then I have time

452
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:53,545
to stay at home
and accompany you and Mother.

453
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,575
Mm.

454
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,239
When looking for a new job,

455
00:24:56,239 --> 00:24:57,520
remove the scales from your eyes

456
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,760
in case you get stuck

457
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,439
and be bullied again.

458
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,500
Who bullied Shizhen?

459
00:25:04,479 --> 00:25:05,700
- No one.
- No one.

460
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,119
Don't keep anything from me.

461
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,200
We didn't.

462
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,721
Father, it was just a figure of speech.

463
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:12,319
I wouldn't let anyone bully me,

464
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,160
right?

465
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,400
Here, Father.

466
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,040
Enjoy the food.

467
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,040
Have some vegetables.

468
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,040
All right.

469
00:25:19,325 --> 00:25:21,285
Father, Mother, I'm full.

470
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,920
Mother, I'm on the night shift.

471
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:23,920
Don't leave the door unlocked for me.

472
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,719
Take good care of yourself.

473
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:28,719
Don't be exhausted.

474
00:25:28,825 --> 00:25:29,556
Mm.

475
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,425
Mother,

476
00:25:30,425 --> 00:25:31,350
I'll walk him out.

477
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:31,925
Mm.

478
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,680
- I gotta go.
- Take good care of yourself.

479
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,479
Shixun, Shixun.

480
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:41,725
Let me take your bag.

481
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:44,560
(Renshouli)

482
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,450
(Renshouli)
Shixun.

483
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,599
Shixun.

484
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,119
Are you still angry with me?

485
00:25:49,479 --> 00:25:50,800
Why should I be angry?

486
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,599
You quit your job, didn't you?

487
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:54,359
What? Are you

488
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:55,599
still going to be in a relationship
with him?

489
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,850
Shixun,

490
00:25:57,719 --> 00:25:59,000
what are you talking about?

491
00:26:02,199 --> 00:26:03,575
What are you going to do

492
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,079
with Wenchunli?

493
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,199
You want to ask Rong Dingkun

494
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,800
for an explanation?

495
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,760
How?

496
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:13,239
I don't even have any evidence.

497
00:26:13,479 --> 00:26:14,160
To put it plainly,

498
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,839
Concubine Sun told me about it.

499
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:16,880
If Rong Dingkun knows

500
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,800
Concubine Sun sold him out,

501
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,839
how will he punish her?

502
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,041
Even if I want to take revenge,

503
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,300
I can't leave her in danger.

504
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,839
But I can't just let it go.

505
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,700
(Yong'anli)

506
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:32,550
Think about it.

507
00:26:33,075 --> 00:26:34,359
Our house was burned down.

508
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,319
But we're still alive.

509
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,239
However...

510
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,640
Some of our neighbors
lost their family members.

511
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,360
They're still suffering in pain.

512
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:45,275
They don't even know

513
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:47,325
who brought such pain to them.

514
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,199
I must

515
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:52,640
get justice for them.

516
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,520
Shixun,

517
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,425
think carefully about it.

518
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,560
Rong Dingkun is rather powerful

519
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,040
in illegal and legal areas.

520
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:02,199
Due to the protection

521
00:27:02,199 --> 00:27:03,680
of warlords and politicians,

522
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,680
he managed to keep such a big fire case

523
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,079
from everyone else.

524
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:09,719
If we fight him,

525
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,680
we'll be like kicking
against the pricks.

526
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,000
When you want to take revenge,

527
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,520
I fully support you.

528
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,760
But before you plan to do anything,

529
00:27:18,959 --> 00:27:20,550
think of our parents

530
00:27:20,825 --> 00:27:22,146
and don't act on impulse.

531
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:23,760
If you have an idea,

532
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,174
discuss it with me.

533
00:27:25,239 --> 00:27:26,119
What do you say?

534
00:27:27,695 --> 00:27:29,455
I'm in my twenties.

535
00:27:29,455 --> 00:27:30,575
I'm no longer a teenager

536
00:27:30,575 --> 00:27:32,200
who is impulsive and irritable.

537
00:27:32,825 --> 00:27:34,785
I won't get you in bigger trouble

538
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:36,560
(Yong'anli)
just for quick revenge.

539
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,750
Don't worry.

540
00:27:37,775 --> 00:27:38,550
Mm.

541
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,680
Shizhen,

542
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,439
you stayed in the Rong family

543
00:27:42,439 --> 00:27:43,800
for three months.

544
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,839
What weaknesses does Rong Dingkun have?

545
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,040
As far as I know him,

546
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:51,959
he cares most

547
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:53,920
for his reputation.

548
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:56,119
He's mercenary and lecherous

549
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:57,525
and has done a lot of bad things.

550
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:58,920
But he pretends

551
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,599
that he's a decent gentleman.

552
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,839
Unfortunately, he's ill-behaved
and immoral.

553
00:28:05,025 --> 00:28:06,119
So, he failed many things

554
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:08,375
because of his own problems.

555
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:10,000
When I was in the Rong family,

556
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,359
I always avoided him

557
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:12,925
and didn't interact with him too much.

558
00:28:13,439 --> 00:28:15,280
Many people told me

559
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,640
that he likes young schoolgirls

560
00:28:17,825 --> 00:28:19,675
who are submissive and well-educated.

561
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:21,839
I'm a young schoolgirl.

562
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:23,461
But my behaviors

563
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,719
never make me

564
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:26,000
submissive.

565
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,800
Once,

566
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,079
I talked with Miss Fanglin

567
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:31,920
about the new women stuff.

568
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,239
When he heard us,

569
00:28:33,239 --> 00:28:34,400
he was upset.

570
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:36,040
So,

571
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,325
at heart,

572
00:28:37,325 --> 00:28:39,439
he's a very conservative man.

573
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,550
What about Rong Jiashang?

574
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,800
What makes you like him?

575
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:49,765
I didn't like him when I first met him.

576
00:28:50,075 --> 00:28:51,039
When I first taught him,

577
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,359
he didn't obey me at all.

578
00:28:52,544 --> 00:28:54,225
It took me quite a long time

579
00:28:54,225 --> 00:28:55,920
to convince him

580
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,425
so that he took classes regularly.

581
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,839
After I communicated more with him,

582
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,000
I realized

583
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,349
that he was different

584
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,900
from what others

585
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,181
thought of him.

586
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,031
How different?

587
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:08,800
He's just a spoilt playboy

588
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,959
who can do nothing, isn't he?

589
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,350
Shixun, think about it.

590
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,439
(Yong'anli)
He was brought up by his stepmother.

591
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,221
(Renshouli)
How could he be spoilt?

592
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:19,359
He's just young

593
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:21,025
and he's eager to distinguish himself

594
00:29:21,365 --> 00:29:23,325
so that he'll no longer
be taunted by his stepmother

595
00:29:23,325 --> 00:29:25,046
or be controlled by his father.

596
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,275
He goes to extremes

597
00:29:27,275 --> 00:29:28,560
in some cases.

598
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,475
But he isn't a playboy.

599
00:29:31,574 --> 00:29:32,775
What's more,

600
00:29:32,775 --> 00:29:34,574
he's very clever and talented.

601
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:36,560
He's just keeping a low profile.

602
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:38,119
He doesn't want to take over
his family business, either.

603
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,500
He only wants to join the army.

604
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,210
You speak so highly of him.

605
00:29:44,025 --> 00:29:44,841
Of course.

606
00:29:44,841 --> 00:29:46,520
He has shortcomings, too.

607
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,800
No man is perfect.

608
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,680
He's in his early twenties, anyway.

609
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:52,839
I don't mean to praise him.

610
00:29:53,289 --> 00:29:54,450
I just don't want you

611
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:55,800
to misunderstand him.

612
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,319
What about

613
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:58,075
his flirting with you?

614
00:29:58,439 --> 00:30:00,280
He was quite innocent.

615
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,650
He was drunk that day

616
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:03,209
and talked to me when staggering.

617
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,239
Maids of his family saw us.

618
00:30:05,464 --> 00:30:06,825
To stir up trouble,

619
00:30:06,825 --> 00:30:07,864
they shouted out.

620
00:30:08,199 --> 00:30:10,599
We were both embarrassed.

621
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:11,560
Without another option,

622
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,959
he took the blame forcibly.

623
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:14,599
His father scolded him,

624
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:15,906
but he didn't complain.

625
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,800
So, you fell in love with him?

626
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,831
It's not the exact reason.

627
00:30:23,199 --> 00:30:24,479
After we communicate more,

628
00:30:24,479 --> 00:30:25,719
I realize

629
00:30:26,475 --> 00:30:28,516
that he's a lonely man.

630
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,425
What's rare,

631
00:30:30,425 --> 00:30:32,066
he has a pure heart.

632
00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:33,520
He's sincere to me, too.

633
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:35,280
At first,

634
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,800
I was attracted
by his intelligence and talent.

635
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:39,239
Later,

636
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:41,280
I had pity for his loneliness.

637
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,400
Besides,

638
00:30:45,325 --> 00:30:47,165
he indeed looks handsome.

639
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,925
So,

640
00:30:50,925 --> 00:30:52,565
it's because he's handsome?

641
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:55,719
Come on, girl.

642
00:30:55,719 --> 00:30:56,839
You're quite...

643
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:58,280
Shixun, do you dare to say

644
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,300
that you don't like beautiful girls?

645
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,150
You've got girls since you were little

646
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:04,359
and when you were in college.

647
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:06,160
They're all beautiful, aren't they?

648
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,175
It's just history.

649
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,199
Now, I've grown up.

650
00:31:12,199 --> 00:31:14,040
I'll no longer
be attracted by appearance.

651
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,469
Instead, I value more

652
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,359
over a girl's character, knowledge,

653
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,500
and manners.

654
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,199
But Shixun,

655
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,825
you and Rong Jiashang

656
00:31:22,825 --> 00:31:24,144
haven't contacted too much.

657
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:25,744
You don't know him very well.

658
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,920
So,

659
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,025
how do you know

660
00:31:28,025 --> 00:31:29,560
if I have judged him correctly?

661
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,850
You have a prejudice

662
00:31:32,225 --> 00:31:33,839
against him, don't you?

663
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:38,250
He's Rong Dingkun's son, anyway.

664
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,175
How do you expect to end up with him?

665
00:31:44,425 --> 00:31:45,665
You make sense.

666
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:51,600
(Yong'anli, Renshouli)

667
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,400
(Red House Hospital)

668
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:01,691
Shizhen.

669
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:04,400
Oh, superstar.

670
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:08,239
You look so fashionable.

671
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:09,350
Where are you going?

672
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:10,975
I'm going to take a few shots
in the movie set.

673
00:32:10,975 --> 00:32:11,625
What about you?

674
00:32:11,959 --> 00:32:12,839
Are you sick?

675
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:13,655
No.

676
00:32:13,655 --> 00:32:14,775
I brought lunch to my brother.

677
00:32:14,775 --> 00:32:16,239
I'm glad you're not sick.
These days,

678
00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:17,850
I've been expecting to dine with you.

679
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:20,040
What do you think of my new car?

680
00:32:20,325 --> 00:32:22,125
It's my birthday present from Boss.

681
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,560
It looks great.

682
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:26,400
Come on. Get in the car.

683
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,239
Let me drive you.

684
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:27,839
Mm.

685
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:28,750
Be careful.

686
00:32:58,959 --> 00:32:59,675
Shizhen.

687
00:33:02,719 --> 00:33:03,575
Shizhen.

688
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:05,025
Get out of my way.

689
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:08,975
I miss you a lot.

690
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,050
Your father

691
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,960
had Wenchunli burned down,

692
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:21,375
right?

693
00:33:23,525 --> 00:33:24,846
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

694
00:33:26,719 --> 00:33:28,175
I just got to know that.

695
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:29,760
These days,

696
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,820
I've been thinking
about your family business.

697
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:34,546
I don't know how to explain it.

698
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:35,750
I'm afraid that you may hate me.

699
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,330
But I also want to push my luck

700
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,920
and I wish you didn't know it.

701
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,180
There's no absolute secret.

702
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,920
If I didn't know it,

703
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,800
would you keep it from me forever?

704
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,500
I don't know.

705
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,239
I'm selfish.

706
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,479
It's already hard to have you.

707
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,575
I don't want any other trouble.

708
00:34:04,925 --> 00:34:06,400
Have you thought about the consequences?

709
00:34:07,525 --> 00:34:09,425
If I really got to know that

710
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,891
after we were in a relationship,

711
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,560
what would I do?

712
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,000
I have.

713
00:34:20,575 --> 00:34:22,875
But whether you know it or not,

714
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,719
we can't be in a relationship.

715
00:34:27,575 --> 00:34:28,376
But when I keep it from you,

716
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,975
you won't hate me at least.

717
00:34:34,479 --> 00:34:36,600
Are you going
to defend your father forever?

718
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,225
No.

719
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,669
He has done all kinds of evil.

720
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,520
And he'll get what he deserves.

721
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,000
I enjoy the wealth he gets from evil.

722
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:46,625
I'll be punished, too.

723
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,040
Everything is fair.

724
00:34:48,725 --> 00:34:50,165
I never mean to speak in defense of him.

725
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,760
I just don't want him
to influence our relationship.

726
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,600
But looks like

727
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,320
it's too late to explain.

728
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,919
You have reasons to hate me.

729
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,025
I don't hate you.

730
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,925
I just don't know what to do.

731
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,225
You saw my father.

732
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,450
You saw the ruins of Wenchunli, too.

733
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,520
My father survived luckily.

734
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:23,639
But many neighbors

735
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:24,879
have lost their families

736
00:35:24,879 --> 00:35:25,800
in the fire.

737
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,239
The fire is like a pain in the neck

738
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:32,850
between us.

739
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,550
How can we be in a relationship?

740
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,875
Your feelings for me

741
00:35:45,525 --> 00:35:46,805
move me a lot.

742
00:35:47,775 --> 00:35:49,015
Since I was born,

743
00:35:50,879 --> 00:35:53,025
you're the first man
who has had such true love for me.

744
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,280
Everybody wants

745
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,000
a simple, peaceful, and sweet life.

746
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,650
But destiny makes fools of us.

747
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,950
Troubles come one after another.

748
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,350
So, Jiashang,

749
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,239
give up.

750
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:16,475
Why must you live a thorny life,

751
00:36:17,879 --> 00:36:19,575
instead of having a bright future?

752
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,960
But in love,

753
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,100
we can't stop just as we wish.

754
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,120
I don't want it.

755
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:30,560
I love you,

756
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:32,600
as if I were going crazy

757
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,801
and as if you cast a spell on me.

758
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,360
I don't want to give up like this.

759
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,350
What do you want, then?

760
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,511
Let's try

761
00:36:48,475 --> 00:36:50,036
if we can find out a way

762
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,900
to make you not hate me.

763
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,000
All right.

764
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:03,550
Ask your father
to apologize in the newspaper,

765
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:06,125
admit what he has done,

766
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:08,075
surrender himself to the police

767
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,325
and compensate the victims.

768
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,375
If he can do that,

769
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:13,479
I'll no longer

770
00:37:13,479 --> 00:37:14,500
hate your family.

771
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,950
We can be in a relationship, too.

772
00:37:22,025 --> 00:37:23,025
But the problem is...

773
00:37:23,959 --> 00:37:25,125
Can he do that?

774
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:34,159
That day, you also told me

775
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:35,479
you wanted
to break off your engagement.

776
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:37,775
It was a beautiful plan.

777
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:40,175
But you failed to do it.

778
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,125
Because you're Rong Dingkun's son.
