2
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,100
=Episode 15=

3
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:38,360
Miss Yu,

4
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,279
don't be too upset.

5
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,599
Mr. Jiashang's birthday party is coming.

6
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,625
Show up in your best look,

7
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,720
and Mr. Yang will feel sorry

8
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,160
for neglecting you.

9
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,199
Thank you for cheering me up.

10
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,680
Sadly,

11
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,850
I can only come in an old gown

12
00:01:55,279 --> 00:01:57,300
and pray that no one will laugh at me.

13
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,919
Who will laugh at you?

14
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,190
Uncle.

15
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,200
There you are, Zhihui.

16
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,479
Long time no see.

17
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,000
You've grown this tall.

18
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,960
Where are my wife and daughters?

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,225
Ma'am has taken Miss Fanglin and Fanghua
to try on the new dresses

20
00:02:16,525 --> 00:02:18,199
and they won't come back for lunch.

21
00:02:19,575 --> 00:02:20,375
Leave us.

22
00:02:20,475 --> 00:02:21,100
Yes.

23
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:23,675
Who did you say would laugh at you?

24
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,160
I was just joking with Miss Feng.

25
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,440
Jiashang's birthday party

26
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,450
is just a few days away.

27
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,160
I'm afraid my shabby dress
would disgrace you.

28
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,080
When a girl attends a party,

29
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,025
how can she not

30
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:39,746
have a beautiful dress?

31
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,880
It's so thoughtless of your aunt.

32
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,861
She should have bought
a new dress for you, too.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,759
I don't mean that, Uncle.

34
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:48,800
I was just joking.

35
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,600
Aunt has already taken good care of me.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,320
Shaoqing left many dresses
when she ran away.

37
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,356
They're supposed to be donated
to the church.

38
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,039
Zhihui, if you don't mind,

39
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,039
go pick some.

40
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,240
She doesn't like to dance.

41
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,199
Many of her dresses are still new.

42
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:06,759
If any dresses strike your fancy,

43
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,279
take them away.

44
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,559
Uncle,

45
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:10,919
would it be all right?

46
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,125
Why would it not?

47
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,119
I've approved of that.

48
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,350
Remember to come often

49
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,500
and visit us.

50
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,130
Mm.

51
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,150
Thank you, Uncle.

52
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,250
Go ahead.

53
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,119
Miss Feng,

54
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:23,080
could you please go with me?

55
00:03:25,225 --> 00:03:25,945
Yes.

56
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,200
Thank you, Uncle.

57
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,650
That's the wardrobe.

58
00:04:04,175 --> 00:04:05,975
These dresses are beautiful!

59
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,900
What a pity if they're donated!

60
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:12,839
Uncle was so nice to her,

61
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,675
but she still ran away

62
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:16,215
and chose to live a hard life.

63
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:17,900
I don't know what she's thinking.

64
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,450
I guess

65
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,760
Miss Sun loves freedom more.

66
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,275
There's no such thing
as absolute freedom.

67
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,160
Miss Feng,

68
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,000
how do I look in this dress?

69
00:04:39,525 --> 00:04:40,645
Good.

70
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,000
But I remember

71
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,025
Miss Sun often wore this dress.

72
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,720
She did?

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,920
It suits me well, I think.

74
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,200
It's made in France.

75
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,160
I'd like to pick this.

76
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,119
I'll go try it on.

77
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,799
We've finally bought everything we need.

78
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:05,725
Mm, yes.

79
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,239
Aunt.

80
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:08,399
Zhihui.

81
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:11,279
What brings you here?

82
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,600
My mother made some marmalade.

83
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,679
She knows you like it

84
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:15,040
and asked me to bring some to you.

85
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:16,399
Come on. Be seated.

86
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:25,000
Jiashang's birthday is coming soon.

87
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,119
But I don't have a good dress

88
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:28,200
for his birthday party.

89
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:29,900
When I was chatting with Miss Feng,

90
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,480
Uncle happened to hear us.

91
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,440
He then asked me to pick

92
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,279
one of Miss Sun's dresses.

93
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,325
I should have thought of it.

94
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:42,800
Don't say that.

95
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,275
Here.

96
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,839
You just bought it.

97
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:52,700
I can't accept it.

98
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,025
Now, no one still cares about me,

99
00:05:56,025 --> 00:05:57,239
but you and your mother.

100
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:59,075
I want to give it to you.

101
00:06:01,075 --> 00:06:02,200
Thank you, Aunt.

102
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:06,095
Men in the Huang family
are all unreliable.

103
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,239
They're just hopeless.

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,279
When they think I have no say
in the Rong family,

105
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,320
they completely ignore me.

106
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:16,119
Those snobs.

107
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:17,720
For them,

108
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,279
I even annoyed my husband.

109
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:21,880
Aunt,

110
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:24,600
don't get angry at such ungrateful men.

111
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,625
Mm.

112
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,880
Tell me

113
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,200
what happened between you and Xiucheng.

114
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,760
All lovebirds sometimes quarrel.

115
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,839
If he's still cold to you,

116
00:06:43,025 --> 00:06:44,105
don't be afraid.

117
00:06:44,475 --> 00:06:45,125
Mm.

118
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,000
You know what?

119
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,320
At the dancing party,

120
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,279
there will be many handsome young men.

121
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,160
By then,

122
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,550
I'll pick another good boyfriend
for you.

123
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,275
Mm.

124
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:55,679
Thank you, Aunt.

125
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,825
Don't worry.

126
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,760
Count on me.

127
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,320
Aunt, it's getting late.

128
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,600
I'll take my leave.

129
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,640
My mother is in poor health.

130
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,640
I want to spend more time with her.

131
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,640
Fine.

132
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,200
I won't keep you for dinner, then.

133
00:07:12,525 --> 00:07:13,200
Mm.

134
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,320
See you, cousins.

135
00:07:17,825 --> 00:07:19,024
Be careful on your way back.

136
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:27,850
Miss.

137
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,825
Come on.

138
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,200
Be careful.

139
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,650
Mother, what do you think of this?

140
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,100
- Looks good.
- I still can't remember.

141
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,119
Look at this.

142
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:36,000
- Ma'am.
- It doesn't matter.

143
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,160
- Ma'am.
- Ask Miss Feng for advice.

144
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,150
Concubine Sun is back with the baby.

145
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:40,839
Why is she back?

146
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:41,800
I don't know.

147
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,450
She just gave birth, didn't she?

148
00:07:52,525 --> 00:07:53,375
Well,

149
00:07:53,475 --> 00:07:54,595
there you are.

150
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,279
Good evening, Ma'am.

151
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,000
What are you waiting for?

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,559
Go get a warmer for me.

153
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:13,040
It's cold out here.

154
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,950
My son is weak

155
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,589
and he must be warm.

156
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,679
Go.

157
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,160
Come, come.

158
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,850
Yes.

159
00:08:21,475 --> 00:08:22,160
Go.

160
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,279
Wait.

161
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,725
Get me a cup of hot tea.

162
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,239
Yes, Ma'am.

163
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:28,799
Has my room been cleaned?

164
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,050
Yes, Ma'am.

165
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:33,080
All the furniture should be sterilized
with alcohol more than three times.

166
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,750
Come on,

167
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,080
if you really cared for your son,

168
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,225
you should have stayed in hospital.

169
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,280
Doctors and nurses are available there.

170
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,679
The servants assigned to you

171
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:46,158
are also at your service.

172
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,520
These days,

173
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,320
we're preparing
for Jiashang's birthday party.

174
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,800
And we're quite busy.

175
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,799
But you're suddenly back.

176
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,119
Aren't you making more trouble?

177
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:57,880
Sorry, Ma'am,

178
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:00,000
for the trouble

179
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,625
my son and I have brought you.

180
00:09:08,325 --> 00:09:09,325
Mother...

181
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,375
Shizhen.

182
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:29,479
There you are.

183
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:30,525
Concubine Sun?

184
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,775
Don't call me that.

185
00:09:32,775 --> 00:09:34,050
You sound distant.

186
00:09:34,525 --> 00:09:35,400
You...

187
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,050
You have left hospital?

188
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:37,700
Yeah.

189
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,440
Your brother took good care of me
in the hospital.

190
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,840
Now that you're his sister,

191
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,119
you're my sister, too.

192
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:43,925
From this day on,

193
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,159
we'll be sisters.

194
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:46,825
Call me Sister Sun.

195
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,200
Sisters?

196
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:53,200
Mr. Jiashang's birthday party
will be held tomorrow.

197
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,050
Have you prepared a dress for that?

198
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,725
Dress...

199
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,100
I know you haven't.

200
00:09:59,175 --> 00:09:59,880
Here.

201
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,320
It's for you.

202
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,100
How does it look?

203
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,119
Take it.

204
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:08,479
It's too expensive. I can't accept it.

205
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:09,719
It's not expensive.

206
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,200
I'm regarding you as my sister.

207
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,825
Don't decline the dress.

208
00:10:12,825 --> 00:10:13,520
Take it.

209
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,200
You need jewels for the dress, too.

210
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,320
Go pick some with me.

211
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,000
Master has given me a lot of jewels.

212
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,960
Many of them are new.

213
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,599
Take whatever you like.

214
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:21,599
Don't feel hesitant.

215
00:10:21,599 --> 00:10:22,225
Go.

216
00:10:22,225 --> 00:10:23,475
No, thanks.

217
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,479
I'm grateful for the dress.

218
00:10:25,479 --> 00:10:26,760
Well,

219
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,039
I'll borrow this dress, then.

220
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:28,880
After the birthday party,

221
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,400
I'll wash it and return it to you.

222
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,350
I don't need any jewels, though.

223
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,200
Fine, then.

224
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,875
I... I'll leave you alone.

225
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,975
Thank you.

227
00:11:35,599 --> 00:11:36,650
I happened to find this perfume.

228
00:11:36,775 --> 00:11:38,550
I think its aroma suits you very well.

229
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,050
Thank you for your hard work
with my birthday party.

230
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,750
Hope you'll like it.

231
00:11:44,475 --> 00:11:45,391

Look at the camera.

Come and take a photo with Father.

You look gorgeous today.

277
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,320
So do you.

278
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:14,840
Looks as if the dress were made for you.

279
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,711
Thank you, Uncle.

280
00:14:18,575 --> 00:14:20,800
Jiashang, happy birthday.

281
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,089

- Come in, please.
- Come in, please.

286
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,441
Like father, like son.

287
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:36,506
Mr. Jiashang is quite handsome.

288
00:14:37,075 --> 00:14:38,995
Mr. Rong has excellent
sons and daughters.

289
00:14:39,326 --> 00:14:40,525
He's quite lucky.

290
00:14:40,525 --> 00:14:41,364
Yeah.

291

Cheers.

292
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,199
I hear Mr. Jiashang has been back
in Shanghai for nearly half a year.

293
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:47,719
He looks handsome,

294
00:14:47,925 --> 00:14:49,400
but he's eccentric

295
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,736
and he's quite gauche.

296
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:51,850
No way.

297
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:53,850
I hear he's a clever young man

298
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:54,970
and he's knowledgeable.

299
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,809
He speaks English very fluently.

300
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,550
Even when he stands there,

301
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,151
he looks handsome enough.

302
00:15:00,475 --> 00:15:02,199
I can spend the whole day
looking at him.

303
00:15:02,471 --> 00:15:04,100
Stop looking. Here comes his girlfriend.

304
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,210

305
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,159

306
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:09,025
You look beautiful today.

307
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,039

308
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,039

00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,439
- Jiashang.
- Jiashang.

379
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:09,013
Jiashang, let me introduce her to you.

380
00:19:09,013 --> 00:19:09,825
This is Miss Hashimoto

381
00:19:09,825 --> 00:19:11,160
I once mentioned to you.

382
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,050
Shizhi, this is my brother.

383
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,200
Jiashang?

384
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,111
Jiashang!

385
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,100
It's really you.

386
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:36,800
Shizhi?

387
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,775
You know each other?

388
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:41,525
Aren't you Mr. Tang?

389
00:19:41,525 --> 00:19:43,765
Why are you Mr. Rong now?

390
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,750
Tang? Oh, I see.

391
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,625
When he studied in Chongqing,

392
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:49,950
Father asked him
to use our uncle's family name

393
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,190
in case he would be in danger.

394
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,079
Shizhi,

395
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:55,575
you and my brother
knew each other in Chongqing?

396
00:19:55,575 --> 00:19:56,425
Mm.

397
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:58,959
Do you remember

398
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:00,560
the young man I told you about

399
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,870
who liked to eavesdrop
when I played the piano?

400
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:42,200
So, that's my brother?

401
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,475
Oh, dear. What a coincidence!

402
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:48,465
I'm sorry.

403
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,100
What I just did

404
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,075
is quite impolite.

405
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,119
No.

406
00:20:55,425 --> 00:20:56,905
I was just too surprised.

407
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,829
Why are you a Japanese girl?

408
00:20:59,199 --> 00:21:01,550
My father turns out
to be a Japanese merchant.

409
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,160
Shortly after you left,

410
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,175
he had my little brother and me

411
00:21:05,175 --> 00:21:06,925
taken to Tokyo

412
00:21:06,925 --> 00:21:08,684
and he restored our identities.

413
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,191
I've been trying to look for you,

414
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,959
but I don't know where I can find you.

415
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:20,960
Jiashang,

416
00:21:22,275 --> 00:21:23,555
do you remember

417
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,410
what I said when you left?

418
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,475
If we're predestined to meet,

419
00:21:29,675 --> 00:21:31,196
we will meet again.

420
00:21:32,475 --> 00:21:34,425
See? Here we meet again.

421
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,250
Mm.

422
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,280
Looks like you've been
living a good life.

423
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,034
Jiashang,

424
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,041
I never dreamed

425
00:21:46,425 --> 00:21:47,866
that I could meet you again like this.

426
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,749
What are you doing here?

427
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,121
Miss Feng.

428
00:21:54,121 --> 00:21:55,440
You look gorgeous.

429
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,759
I almost didn't recognize you.

430
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,319
Thank you, Miss Du.

431
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:00,159
You're the most beautiful girl here.

432
00:22:02,175 --> 00:22:03,520
And who is this?

433
00:22:04,175 --> 00:22:06,055
This is Miss Hashimoto
from Hashimoto Company.

434
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,640
Nice to meet you.

435
00:22:08,525 --> 00:22:09,326
Nice to meet you.

436
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,599
Jiashang,

437
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,371
my father and brother have come.

438
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:19,650
Go say hello to them.

439
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:27,196
You don't want me

440
00:22:27,196 --> 00:22:29,125
to announce our engagement

441
00:22:30,325 --> 00:22:32,000
to your new girl and ex-girlfriend
on such an occasion, do you?

442
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:41,760
Excuse me.

443
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,474
Miss Du looks gorgeous.

444
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,113
Who's she?

445
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,350
She's the second daughter
of the owner of Fumin Bank.

446
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,669
Looks like she's very close to Jiashang.

447
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,975
But he has never told me about her.

448
00:23:05,225 --> 00:23:07,985
Did he get to know her
after he was back in Shanghai?

449
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:10,466
Right.

450
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,800
Shixun.

451
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,880
What are you looking at?

452
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,025
I'm looking for you.

453
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:30,079
When did you come?

454
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:31,160
Before you came downstairs.

455
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:33,450
Your new dress?

456
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,520
Concubine Sun gave it to me.

457
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,111
You know what?

458
00:23:38,111 --> 00:23:39,150
Since she left hospital,

459
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:39,950
she has greatly changed

460
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,560
her attitude towards me.

461
00:23:41,841 --> 00:23:44,520
Sometimes, she's just too enthusiastic.

462
00:23:44,675 --> 00:23:45,715
I'm quite curious.

463
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:48,065
What on earth did you do to her?

464
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,650
Doctors care for patients.

465
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:53,331
She's just a patient of mine.

466
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,525
Shixun,

467
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:02,439
do you remember

468
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:03,880
we listened to the radio next door

469
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,769
and danced in our yard
when we were little?

470
00:24:07,075 --> 00:24:08,275
When I make enough money,

471
00:24:08,275 --> 00:24:10,515
I'll buy you the most beautiful dress

472
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,840
so that you no longer need
to borrow it from anyone else.

473
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,975
Thank you.

474
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:20,529
Oh.

475
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,625
What are you staring at?

476
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,959
Nothing.

477
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,560
I'm just checking

478
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,920
whom the Rong family has dealings with.

479
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,499
I hear

480
00:25:12,499 --> 00:25:13,700
that Rong Dingkun

481
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,340
has been very thick with the Japanese.

482
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,500
The Japanese are quite ambitious.

483
00:25:17,775 --> 00:25:18,775
Recently,

484
00:25:18,775 --> 00:25:20,576
they've played many more tricks
in the Northeast.

485
00:25:21,275 --> 00:25:22,874
When Rong Dingkun cooperates with them,

486
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,450
they're quite birds of the same feather

487
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,079
and partners in crime.

488
00:25:27,925 --> 00:25:29,285
You said

489
00:25:30,075 --> 00:25:32,075
exactly the same thing
as Rong Jiashang said.

490
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:36,785
That's how he described his family?

491
00:25:37,725 --> 00:25:38,884
Don't tease me.

492
00:25:57,425 --> 00:25:58,800
- Excuse me.
- No problem.

493
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,639
Everybody. Everybody.

494
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:05,200
This way, please.

495
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,000
Here comes Mr. Meng

496
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,800
from Yongli Bank.

497
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,640
What's going on?

498
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,079
The chairman of Yongli Bank

499
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:20,160
came to the birthday of Mr. Jiashang?

500
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,300
Yongli Bank?

501
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,119
You don't even know it?

502
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:25,040
It's a private bank

503
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,680
that has suddenly got popular.

504
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,959
It's said to be supported by foreigners

505
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,359
and it's financially strong.

506
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:30,150
That's right.

507
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,271
I'd like to see

508
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,160
the expression on Rong Dingkun's face

509
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,975
when he meets me again.

510
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:06,520
You know him?

511
00:27:08,825 --> 00:27:09,864
No way.

512
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,291
Mr. Rong,

513
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,000
how have you been lately?

514
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:39,040
I'm sorry.

515
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:41,439
I interrupted you.

516
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,270
Please go on.

517
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:48,725
You didn't.

518
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,775
It is always a pleasure

519
00:27:52,175 --> 00:27:53,300
to see an old friend.

520
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:55,750
Xu'an,

521
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,775
shall we

522
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,560
talk later?

523
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,075
Somebody.

524
00:28:03,199 --> 00:28:05,400
Get some wine to Mr. Meng.

525
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:07,950
Thank you.

526
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:10,400
I'm sure

527
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,040
this man doesn't get along
with the Rong family.

528
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:15,125
Actually, it's worse.

529
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,400
There's a blood feud between them.

530
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,800
Thank you.

531
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,040
Thank you, everybody,
for coming to my son's birthday party.

532
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,350
When my son was 18 years old,

533
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,275
he was still in the Military Academy

534
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,800
so that he didn't have a party.

535
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:45,375
Today,

536
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,119
I'm holding the party for him

537
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,959
when he's 20 years old.

538
00:28:50,575 --> 00:28:51,895
Like all the other parents,

539
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,400
I always have simple expectations

540
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,250
for my children.

541
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,959
I want my son to be

542
00:28:57,959 --> 00:28:59,640
a decent man

543
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,680
who will love his family

544
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:03,839
and will win honor

545
00:29:04,239 --> 00:29:05,560
for his clan

546
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:06,800
and his nation.

547
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,599
Thank you.

548
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:11,680
Thank you, everybody.

549
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:18,300
Come on, Jiashang.

550
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:23,800
What a good young man!

551
00:29:24,675 --> 00:29:25,900
He's indeed handsome.

552
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:34,405
He's indeed an excellent young man.

553
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:35,425
That's right.

554
00:29:36,225 --> 00:29:37,388
What a handsome man!

555
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,719
Thank you, seniors,

556
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:43,525
for taking care of me.

557
00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:46,150
And thank you for coming, my friends.

558
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,751
Today is my birthday.

559
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:51,760
Hope you'll have a good time

560
00:29:52,439 --> 00:29:53,625
and enjoy yourselves.

561
00:29:54,825 --> 00:29:56,146
- Happy birthday!
- Bravo!

562
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,975
What a good young man!

563
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:01,040
Come on.

564
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,096
Bravo, bravo.

565
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:12,225
Go, go, go.

566
00:30:12,225 --> 00:30:12,951
Come on.

567
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,199
Come on.

568
00:30:14,925 --> 00:30:15,900
- Thank you.
- Let's continue.

569
00:30:16,725 --> 00:30:18,200
It's been long since we last talked.

570
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,640
I didn't expect Miss Hashimoto

571
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,760
to be Jiashang's girlfriend
in Chongqing.

572
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:25,875
When I first knew it,

573
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:27,880
I thought it was their destiny.

574
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,199
But think about it.

575
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,599
Lanxin is here, too.

576
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:34,395
New girlfriend and the ex-girlfriend...

577
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,071
How awkward it is!

578
00:30:37,325 --> 00:30:38,565
Yeah.

579
00:30:38,725 --> 00:30:40,400
Miss Hashimoto looks at Jiashang

580
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,719
as if she still loves him.

581
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:44,225
Have we caused trouble for Jiashang?

582
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:45,075
We...

583
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,359
But,

584
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:47,880
she is already here.

585
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,439
We can't just expel her.

586
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,880
Besides, we're hosts of the party.

587
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,359
We have to take care of her,

588
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:55,725
or we'll be too impolite.

589
00:30:55,725 --> 00:30:56,325
Mm.

590
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,439
Ms. Chen.

591
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,275
Mm.

592
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,800
Mr. Jiashang.

593
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,750
Where's my father?

594
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,599
He has gone to the study
on the second floor with Mr. Meng.

595
00:31:12,199 --> 00:31:13,125
Tell me.

596
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,199
Ma'am looked very unhappy

597
00:31:15,199 --> 00:31:16,160
when she saw Mr. Meng.

598
00:31:16,239 --> 00:31:17,760
There must be a reason for that.

599
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:20,284
You've been serving her
for the longest time.

600
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:21,439
You know the reason, don't you?

601
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,825
Mr. Jiashang,

602
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,375
I'm a mere maid.

603
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,760
I don't know much about Ma'am.

604
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,280
Just tell me.

605
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,959
I won't tell anyone else.

606
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:34,719
Actually,

607
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:36,719
it happened a dozen years ago.

608
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:39,265
Ma'am was pregnant with Mr. Jiaxin.

609
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,375
But Master got to know a Miss Meng

610
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:42,976
in the painting club.

611
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,400
For Miss Meng,

612
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,520
Master wasn't back home for months.

613
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,760
Though pregnant,

614
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,359
Ma'am talked to Miss Meng.

615
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,719
Miss Meng was stubborn.

616
00:31:50,719 --> 00:31:51,880
Instead of leaving Master,

617
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,800
she said

618
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:54,200
she objected to arranged marriage

619
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,680
and wanted free love.

620
00:31:55,725 --> 00:31:57,520
Ma'am was pissed off.

621
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,800
Besides, Master had a problem

622
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,439
with his business at that time.

623
00:32:00,439 --> 00:32:01,920
Ma'am nearly had a miscarriage.

624
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:05,079
Later, Concubine Wang was pregnant

625
00:32:05,199 --> 00:32:07,040
so that Miss Meng left
in a fit of anger.

626
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:08,599
Mr. Meng up there

627
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:10,199
is Miss Meng's younger brother.

628
00:32:12,325 --> 00:32:14,166
So, it's about love affairs.

629
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:16,239
Mr. Jiashang, if you don't mind,

630
00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:17,599
I'm getting back to work.

631
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,439
Go ahead.

632
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,760
Bro.

633
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:21,959
I'm sorry.

634
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:22,599
I'm late.

635
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,719
Here's your birthday present.

636
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,975
Check it out.

637
00:32:26,199 --> 00:32:27,560
Thank you, bro.

638
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:35,160
It looks exquisite.

639
00:32:35,199 --> 00:32:35,950
Do you like it?

640
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:36,627
Mm.

641
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,775
Thank you.

642
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,520
Mr. Rong.

643
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,319
Don't stand there. Be seated.

644
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,975
This is your home

645
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:05,119
and over a hundred guests are out there.

646
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:06,875
I can't hurt you.

647
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,560
Xu'an,

648
00:33:10,475 --> 00:33:12,750
you've really astonished me.

649
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,450
I heard you came back.

650
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:18,400
I thought you were back
for some small businesses.

651
00:33:18,959 --> 00:33:20,160
Unexpectedly,

652
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:22,400
you're the chairman of Yongli Bank.

653
00:33:22,975 --> 00:33:24,374
You keep quite a low profile.

654
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:28,479
My family isn't as glorious as before.

655
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,359
But a sleeping lion

656
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:31,759
is still stronger than a barking dog.

657
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:33,959
With the support of my family,

658
00:33:34,199 --> 00:33:35,079
I'm doing some business.

659
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,800
I haven't made many achievements.

660
00:33:37,425 --> 00:33:39,425
I'm just not disgracing

661
00:33:40,075 --> 00:33:41,874
my ancestors.

662
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:43,760
Over the years,

663
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,830
I've been thinking of you

664
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,439
and your sister.

665
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:52,359
Qingzhi...

666
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,000
Is she all right?

667
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:58,350
She's dead.

668
00:33:59,475 --> 00:34:00,175
Ah?

669
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,951
How come?

670
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,000
You look so surprised.

671
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:14,089
If you really cared for her,

672
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,039
you would have asked about her

673
00:34:17,775 --> 00:34:19,856
and you wouldn't be so surprised.

674
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,105
When did she die?

675
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,325
After my family moved to America,

676
00:34:24,325 --> 00:34:25,350
she fell ill.

677
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:28,080
After over half a year's treatment,

678
00:34:28,439 --> 00:34:29,719
she still passed away.

679
00:34:31,075 --> 00:34:32,200
But don't worry.

680
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,959
She died peacefully

681
00:34:34,575 --> 00:34:35,600
and never mentioned even a single word

682
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,880
about you.

683
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,320
She died so early.

684
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,919
Where is she buried?

685
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,360
In San Francisco.

686
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,075
I really didn't expect this.

687
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,679
She was so young.

688
00:34:52,439 --> 00:34:54,200
After she got married in America,

689
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,400
I thought she would live a happy life

690
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:57,796
and even her children would grow up.

691
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,000
What about you?

692
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:08,320
Are you

693
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,900
focusing on the bank only?

694
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,320
My family

695
00:35:13,919 --> 00:35:15,199
does small businesses.

696
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,810
And I've hired capable assistants.

697
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:20,239
I have nothing to worry about.

698
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,560
But at present,

699
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,600
the situation isn't stable.

700
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,600
Bank lending is dangerous

701
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:28,225
and quite risky.

702
00:35:29,479 --> 00:35:30,840
It's influenced by the wars, too.

703
00:35:31,479 --> 00:35:32,625
Any carelessness

704
00:35:32,975 --> 00:35:34,625
will make me go bankrupt.

705
00:35:35,439 --> 00:35:36,679
But you're different, Mr. Rong.

706
00:35:37,175 --> 00:35:38,250
With great fortunes,

707
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,439
you're no longer what you were.

708
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,080
When there's a chance,
I'd like to learn from you.

709
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,560
You flatter me, Xu'an.

710
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,675
Young men like you are promising

711
00:35:48,675 --> 00:35:49,876
and you will rule the future.

712
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,320
I'm so old

713
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:54,360
that I've fallen behind the times.

714
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,199
It's modest of you, Mr. Rong.

715
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:10,575
I remember your residence

716
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,300
wasn't as splendid as it is now.

717
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,325
But now,

718
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,850
it's magnificent.

719
00:36:19,919 --> 00:36:21,120
Xu'an,

720
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,950
I'm sorry for your sister.

721
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,040
She loved me wholeheartedly,

722
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:30,520
but I failed to love her like that.

723
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,520
Over the years,

724
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,159
I've never stopped thinking of her.

725
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:37,145
But I wasn't brave enough

726
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,080
to ask about her.

727
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,879
I didn't expect her to die so early.

728
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,520
You weren't brave enough?

729
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,085
Come on.

730
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:56,675
When you tricked

731
00:36:57,479 --> 00:36:59,025
my sister

732
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:01,239
into smoking opium,

733
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,600
you were quite brave.

734
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:06,925
Blessed by ancestors,

735
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:09,280
my family

736
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:11,760
barely survived.

737
00:37:16,919 --> 00:37:18,800
I exhausted all efforts

738
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,375
to have revived

739
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,110
my family properties.

740
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,125
I'm thinking...

741
00:37:26,075 --> 00:37:28,375
Actually, money isn't important.

742
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:32,471
But my family heirloom
can't be in the hand of anyone else.

743
00:37:33,725 --> 00:37:36,324
Mr. Rong, I'd like to ask you.

744
00:37:36,925 --> 00:37:38,560
You swindled my sister

745
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,159
of the Gold Kylin.

746
00:37:40,439 --> 00:37:42,150
Where is it now?

747
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:49,725
I knew you came back for it.

748
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,200
Believe it or not,

749
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:53,750
over the years,

750
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:56,869
I've been looking
for the Gold Kylin, too.

751
00:37:58,479 --> 00:37:59,919
When I was in trouble,

752
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:01,600
your sister gave it to me.

753
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,420
I sold it to pay my debt.

754
00:38:03,919 --> 00:38:05,280
The Gold Kylin

755
00:38:05,399 --> 00:38:07,725
carries the love between Qingzhi and me.

756
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:10,639
Since my condition got better,

757
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:13,040
I've been trying to get it back.

758
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,080
You're quite good at finding excuses.

759
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:20,494
My sister told me

760
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,120
that you swindled her of it.

761
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,760
Forget it.

762
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,239
It's been so many years.

763
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:30,239
There's no point in arguing.

764
00:38:31,399 --> 00:38:33,120
But Mr. Rong,

765
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:35,080
please return the Gold Kylin to me.

766
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:36,959
I will, of course.

767
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,199
Tomorrow,

768
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,479
I'll send more men

769
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:42,639
to look for the treasure.

770
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:05,710
I'm afraid you don't understand
my determination.

771
00:39:08,439 --> 00:39:10,479
If you think I'm joking,

772
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:12,450
you're wrong.

773
00:39:14,475 --> 00:39:15,850
I don't think so.

774
00:39:17,025 --> 00:39:18,959
Twenty years ago,
a mother and her children

775
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:20,450
ran into some bandits

776
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:21,679
when they passed Bailiu Town

777
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:22,879
and they were murdered.

778
00:39:22,879 --> 00:39:24,038
Do you remember?

779
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:30,600
It suddenly occurs to me

780
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,479
that if your eldest son were
still alive,

781
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:38,025
he would be as handsome and talented

782
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,450
as Rong Jiashang.

783
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,650
Xu'an,

784
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,959
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

785
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:53,639
You just don't want to admit it.

786
00:39:56,225 --> 00:39:57,186
That's right.

787
00:39:58,159 --> 00:39:59,600
Over the years,

788
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,950
nearly all your relatives
in your hometown

789
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,040
have been dead.

790
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,159
Even your servants

791
00:40:04,425 --> 00:40:06,264
have been replaced several times.

792
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,439
I guess even your existing wife

793
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:09,159
doesn't know

794
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:11,275
that you had a wife before.

795
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,000
She's dead, anyway.

796
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,351
She won't stand in your way.

797
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,475
But what if someone knows

798
00:40:21,879 --> 00:40:23,199
that you killed your first wife

799
00:40:23,399 --> 00:40:25,450
and her two children

800
00:40:26,279 --> 00:40:29,100
simply because you wanted
to marry Miss Tang

801
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,360
who was from a literary family?

802
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,100
Meng Xu'an,

803
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,239
don't sling mud at me.

804
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:42,360
I'm not a good man.

805
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:44,879
But I would never

806
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,775
kill my wife or children.

807
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:50,649
Dog doesn't eat dog.

808
00:40:50,649 --> 00:40:52,609
Why would I hurt my own children?

809
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,700
You know very well if you did that.

810
00:40:59,025 --> 00:40:59,719
All right.

811
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,306
I'm done here.

812
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:06,675
As for what you would like to do,

813
00:41:07,919 --> 00:41:09,560
make your own decision.

814
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:14,210
Rong Dingkun.

815
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,495
You're a famous philanthropist

816
00:41:17,495 --> 00:41:18,825
and social activist in Shanghai.

817
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,350
If people know you're such a devil,

818
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,275
what will they think of you?

819
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,950
Meng Xu'an,

820
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,561
you can't accuse me without evidence.

821
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:34,429
I've been doing business
in Shanghai for so many years.

822
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,325
You can't overthrow me just as you wish.

823
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:41,120
Considering my temper,

824
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,950
do you think I would come
and meet personally

825
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:44,550
without conclusive evidence?

826
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,800
You made a good point.

827
00:41:50,439 --> 00:41:51,719
Dog doesn't eat dog.

828
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,719
By then, you'll know

829
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:57,250
you can't vindicate yourself

830
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,700
simply by killing all witnesses.

831
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,425
Who would be intimate friends

832
00:42:02,425 --> 00:42:04,145
with someone that killed
his wife and children?

833
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,439
And who

834
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:07,671
would be his relatives by marriage?

835
00:42:09,075 --> 00:42:11,514
People do dangerous business

836
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,679
because they want to make money
for their wives and children

837
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:15,650
so that they can live a good life.

838
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:19,025
But such a ruthless man like you

839
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,725
is one of a kind through the ages.

840
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,620
