00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:40,959
Mr. Jiashang.

4
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:41,519
Get lost!

5
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,800
Why are you leaving?

6
00:01:55,725 --> 00:01:56,966
I quit my job.

7
00:01:57,175 --> 00:01:58,256
Why would I stay?

8
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,779
I wanted to ask you in the day.

9
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,900
What made you want to quit your job?

10
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:04,519
Didn't I explain in the day?

11
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,480
My mission is completed

12
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,039
and I miss my parents.

13
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,559
Why can't I quit my job?

14
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,800
Mrs. Rong approved of that.

15
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,000
She allowed you to leave.

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,679
but I didn't!

17
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:16,650
You weren't the one who hired me.

18
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,700
I'm hiring you now!

19
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,000
Jiashang,

20
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:25,900
don't be so childish.

21
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,020
Shizhen,

22
00:02:35,025 --> 00:02:37,225
you know I want you to stay.

23
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
Jiashang,

24
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,880
you can't always have what you want.

25
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,429
I have my own life

26
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:49,279
and I can't sacrifice it for you.

27
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,200
Are you leaving because of me?

28
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:56,975
Shizhen,

29
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:58,650
answer me.

30
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,461
Yes or no?

31
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:04,525
What's the point?

32
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,325
Jiashang,

33
00:03:10,025 --> 00:03:12,346
things between us aren't going anywhere.

34
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,839
In this case,

35
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,735
we'd better leave them where they are

36
00:03:18,525 --> 00:03:19,484
and go our separate ways.

37
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,440
That way,

38
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,880
at least we won't regret
meeting each other

39
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,491
and will have something nice
to remember by.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,160
Or would you rather wait

41
00:03:31,675 --> 00:03:32,916
until we hate and resent each other?

42
00:03:36,775 --> 00:03:38,300
I'll break off
my engagement to Du Lanxin.

43
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,225
I will do that.

44
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,520
I'll only marry

45
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:48,550
the love of my life.

46
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:51,965
Shizhen,

47
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:56,125
I want you and only you.

48

Jiashang,

49
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,575
I don't doubt your words,

50
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,136
but your execution.

51
00:04:30,025 --> 00:04:32,650
I appreciate how you feel about me,

52
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,959
but are you able to

53
00:04:35,225 --> 00:04:37,385
stand up to your father?

54
00:04:38,075 --> 00:04:38,954
Jiashang,

55
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,750
if you can't even master your own life,

56
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,475
how could you master someone else's?

57
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,315
You're the heir,

58
00:04:49,075 --> 00:04:51,355

You've traced it to him?

192
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:47,400
Jiashang,

193
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,591
that land

194
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,359
was crucial

195
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:52,875
to me and our family.

196
00:11:55,425 --> 00:11:56,906
So you admitted it?

197
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,340
How could you

198
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,225
put hundreds of innocent lives

199
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,225
in peril

200
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05,359
for business

201
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,799
and personal interests?

202
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:11,239
Without my effort

203
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:12,719
and planning all these years,

204
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,159
our family couldn't have come this far.

205
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:17,520
I've been busting my chops to support

206
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,440
you and your sisters' extravagant life.

207
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,810
You can't be too careful

208
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,719
when doing business.

209
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:25,400
There's no room for error.

210
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,159
Those people at Wenchunli

211
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,159
kept asking for more

212
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,280
and refused to move out.

213
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,080
I had no choice.

214
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,400
Even so,

215
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,840
they didn't deserve to die.

216
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:38,960
I thought that fire was an accident,

217
00:12:41,525 --> 00:12:43,239
but no, you arranged it.

218
00:12:43,975 --> 00:12:45,655
So what if I did?

219
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,559
Are you going to
report me to the police?

220
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,175
You keep asking me
to take over your business

221
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:56,225
to turn me into a monster like you?

222
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,139
How dare you!

223
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,840
All those rich and powerful families

224
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,599
are dirty.

225
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:01,500
That's different

226
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,221
from getting blood on your hands.

227
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,320
If I had to kill others,

228
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,559
I'd rather do that on the battlefield

229
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:07,119
without a guilty conscience!

230
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,880
If Jiaxin were still alive,

231
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,520
you could be a pilot

232
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,719
or a soldier all you want.

233
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:13,359
I wouldn't care.

234
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:16,080
But you're the one left.

235
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,719
And you're the eldest.

236
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:19,320
It's your duty and responsibility

237
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,760
to carry our family forward

238
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,599
so that Jiaxin didn't die for nothing.

239
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,799
Now that you know the truth,

240
00:13:39,775 --> 00:13:41,294
I need to remind you

241
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,475
to beware of

242
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,375
Feng Shizhen.

243
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,821
This is her detailed profile.

244
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,039
What do you mean?

245
00:13:57,719 --> 00:13:59,640
A victim of that fire

246
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:01,799
coming to work for us

247
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:04,080
can't be a coincidence.

248
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,119
The more dedicated she is,

249
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:07,679
the more suspicious I get.

250
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,840
Listen,

251
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,919
our family depends on you.

252
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:15,520
Do not let a woman

253
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,559
get in your way.

Shizhen,

265
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,840
why did you come to work for us?

266
00:14:58,175 --> 00:14:59,696
Did you know the truth back then?

267
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,056
Is that why

268
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,899
you're pushing me away?

269
00:15:24,825 --> 00:15:25,505
Yes?

270
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,781
I need a favor.

(Anji Clinic)

272
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,975
Need a ride, Miss?

273
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:33,625
Let's go.

274
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:34,221
Yes.

275
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:45,800
Follow her.

276
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,450
Yes.

277
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:48,520
Sit tight.

278
00:15:49,175 --> 00:15:49,855
Go, go, go!

279
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:02,425
- Thanks.
- Sure.

280
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,300
(Shudeli)

281
00:16:36,479 --> 00:16:37,080
Yes?

282
00:16:37,425 --> 00:16:38,666
Jiashang, it's me.

283
00:16:38,925 --> 00:16:40,840
If I didn't call you,

284
00:16:40,975 --> 00:16:43,000
you'd never contact me, would you?

285
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,450
What do you want?

286
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,679
What did I do?

287
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,080
Why are you mad?

288
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,974
Can't you be nice to me?

289
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,559
Are you calling

290
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:52,975
only for small talk?

291
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,075
Alright. Back to business.

292
00:16:57,325 --> 00:16:59,200
I brought back a roll of
Suzhou embroidery from Hangzhou.

293
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,320
Along the River
During the Qingming Festival.

294
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,520
It's perfect as a decoration
in the study.

295
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,079
Aren't your father the artsy type?

296
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:06,975
I'll drop it off tonight.

297
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,920
You went to Hangzhou?

298
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,000
It was from last time.

299
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,800
I was with my aunt

300
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,500
back home over the past few days.

301
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,920
She went on and on about her past.

302
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,300
I was so sick of it.

303
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,225
By the way,

304
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,599
was it true

305
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,800
that Miss Feng was let go?

306
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,920
She quit after Fanglin and Fanghua

307
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,719
took the exam.

308
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,000
What's wrong?

309
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:30,959
Is there a problem?

310
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,199
I wouldn't dare to judge.

311
00:17:34,439 --> 00:17:35,160
Frankly speaking,

312
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,560
I like her a lot.

313
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:38,959
She's talented, educated

314
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,975
and humble.

315
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,880
I meant to have her teach our children.

316
00:17:48,825 --> 00:17:49,560
Do you know

317
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,520
Yang Xiucheng is back?

318
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,160
Do you think he'll leave

319
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,880
or stay with us?

320
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,429
My father is setting him up

321
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:01,640
with Uncle Zhao's daughter

322
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,800
who's also studying at
Ginling Women's University.

323
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,920
I don't give a hang

324
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,959
if he takes home

325
00:18:07,175 --> 00:18:08,400
all the college girls.

326
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,880
I'm going to get my hair done.

327
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:10,959
Bye now.

328
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:35,599
That vacation did you well.

329
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,280
You look much better

330
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,989
and seem to have gained weight.

331
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,140
Thank you for letting me go.

332
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:47,070
I did a lot of thinking in Hangzhou

333
00:18:47,775 --> 00:18:49,250
and realized

334
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,735
how much you care about me.

335
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,206
You're right.

336
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,199
We can't let

337
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,520
that gold-digger

338
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:56,680
drive a wedge between us.

339
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,119
We're family after all.

340
00:19:05,075 --> 00:19:06,000
Uncle,

341
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,839
I wish to keep working for you

342
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,280
and having you as my mentor.

343
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,160
Alright, alright.

344
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:20,880
Xiucheng,

345
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,160
I'm glad

346
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,199
you've come around.

347
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:24,675
Xiucheng,

348
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
trust me.

349
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:27,920
You'll get what you deserve.

350
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,640
I'm counting on you to help Jiashang.

351
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,971
Your service won't be forgotten.

352
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:36,640
Have a seat.

353
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:37,700
Yes.

354
00:19:53,475 --> 00:19:54,439
- Father.
- Yes.

355
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:55,640
Jiashang.

356
00:19:56,425 --> 00:19:57,160
Xiucheng.

357
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,075
Jiashang.

358
00:19:58,479 --> 00:19:59,325
Jiashang,

359
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,560
work with Xiucheng

360
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:03,359
on our import and export business.

361
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,239
Learn from him.

362
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:06,375
Be humble.

363
00:20:06,925 --> 00:20:07,560
I will.

364
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,219
Did you have fun in Hangzhou, Xiucheng?

365
00:20:15,275 --> 00:20:16,119
Sort of.

366
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,775
I wish it were warmer.

367
00:20:23,825 --> 00:20:24,575
Uncle,

368
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,804
I'm behind on a lot of work.

369
00:20:27,275 --> 00:20:28,280
Please excuse me.

370
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:30,550
Sure.

371
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:45,200
He wants to be back.

372
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:47,839
My men on the ground said

373
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,000
he was with a woman all day

374
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,439
in Hangzhou.

375
00:20:52,175 --> 00:20:53,119
Who was that?

376
00:20:55,075 --> 00:20:56,880
Some social butterfly, I guess.

377
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,359
They couldn't

378
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,640
get too close to him,

379
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,119
or he could easily see through them.

380
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,119
I brought back a roll of

During the Qingming Festival.

382
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:08,775
It's perfect as a decoration
in the study.

383
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:14,700
He grew up under my watch.

384
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,475
He's a smart kid.

385
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,200
He knows

386
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,479
certain things

387
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,314
better than you.

388
00:21:21,825 --> 00:21:22,575
Father,

389
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:25,359
if you no longer trust him,

390
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,680
just do what you have to do.

391
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:28,560
He's been working for us

392
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,900
for so long

393
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,191
and of great help.

394
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:34,055
Given that

395
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,130
you owe him,

396
00:21:37,475 --> 00:21:39,200
please be lenient.

397
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:44,560
Are you taking his side?

398
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,520
Father...

399
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,525
Say no more.

400
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,950
I won't be too hard on him.

401
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,689
Where are we on the Gold Kylin?

402
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,239
I've made progress.

403
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,520
I heard Hashimoto Shozo

404
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,599
got a Gold Kylin,

405
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:04,350
but I'm not sure

406
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,075
if it's the one we're looking for.

407
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,541
Hashimoto?

408
00:22:11,475 --> 00:22:13,680
Pay him a visit to check it.

409
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:15,400
And what if it is?

410
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:17,560
That Gold Kylin

411
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,560
is his treasure.

412
00:22:19,725 --> 00:22:21,164
I don't think he'll sell it.

413
00:22:22,719 --> 00:22:24,560
He'll sell his soul if he's paid enough,

414
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,199
let alone a gold toy.

415
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,319
He seems to have had his eyes

416
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:31,479
on the Nanyang Route

417
00:22:32,475 --> 00:22:34,994
and he'll ask to work with us.

418
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,680
You and his daughter go way back.

419
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,280
You can ask her out more often.

420
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:41,050
Son,

421
00:22:41,225 --> 00:22:42,666
you still have a lot to learn.

422
00:22:43,025 --> 00:22:45,425
A man should know when to eat humble pie

423
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,960
and when to hold his head high.

424
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,830
Be flexible.

425
00:22:51,225 --> 00:22:51,944
Fine.

426
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,719
I was told

427
00:22:58,719 --> 00:23:00,719
that you were doing well at work.

428
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,120
Those assistant managers

429
00:23:02,439 --> 00:23:04,400
spoke highly of you

430
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,599
that young as you are,

431
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:09,319
you're reliable and modest.

432
00:23:10,175 --> 00:23:11,000
Good job.

433

Hua'an is getting old.

434
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,950
He needs someone to share his burden.

435
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,400
I want you

436
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,560
to take care of the shipment.

437
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,040
He's been running those routes

438
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,359
in the south for too long.

439
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,171
It's time to get them back.

440
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,040
I don't think

441
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,390
he'll step back.

442
00:23:32,025 --> 00:23:34,545
That's where you come in
to make it happen.

443
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,680
If it were no sweat to make seniors

444
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,239
cough up their money and power,

445
00:23:39,325 --> 00:23:40,845
I wouldn't need you.

446
00:23:42,675 --> 00:23:43,516
I understand.

how it tastes.

You look preoccupied these days.

459
00:24:45,975 --> 00:24:47,815
Is something bothering you?

460
00:24:55,175 --> 00:24:56,776
We're new here

461
00:24:57,025 --> 00:24:59,345

pay the Rongs a visit?

468
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,760

since the last visit.

475
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,599

476
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,370
they want nothing to do with us.

I know,

Mr. Rong is an antique collector

481
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,359

invite him over

483
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
to see your collection.

484
00:25:46,275 --> 00:25:47,825
That'll be a good chance

485
00:25:47,825 --> 00:25:49,305
of sounding him out

486
00:25:49,305 --> 00:25:50,760

00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,160
What's wrong?

573
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,040
It's my son! He's burning up!

574
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,950
Follow me.

575
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:14,350
(Surgical Clinic)

576
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,721
A premature baby like him

577
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,479
has a weak heart and lungs.

578
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,920
He gets sick easily in winter.

579
00:31:26,439 --> 00:31:27,319
Once his fever breaks,

580
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:27,959
he'll be fine.

581
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:29,400
Here you are.

582
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,084
Why?

583
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,700
What?

584
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:04,249
Nothing.

585
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,125
Why didn't I

586
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:09,806
meet you first?

587
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:14,436
Why did I run into that heartless,

588
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,800
greedy and selfish hypocrite

589
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,880
when I was still innocent?

590
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:24,719
Why gave me a glimmer of hope

591
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:27,070
after throwing me off the cliff

592
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,111
and brought you into my life?

593
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,360
Your son

594
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,880
is getting much stronger.

595
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,400
Dr. Feng,

596
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,760
you're a good man.

597
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,800
I wonder which lucky girl

598
00:32:42,175 --> 00:32:43,280
will marry you.

599
00:32:45,239 --> 00:32:47,839
I'm a poor doctor

600
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:50,125
with sick parents.

601
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:51,880
Even if someone lost her mind

602
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,920
and asked to marry me,

603
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:55,025
I'd say no to not ruin her life.

604
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:56,439
You wouldn't ruin anything.

605
00:32:56,925 --> 00:32:58,680
The smart ones would know

606
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,640
you're trustworthy

607
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,680
and a rare catch.

608
00:33:03,725 --> 00:33:05,599
Money isn't everything.

609
00:33:06,199 --> 00:33:08,359
Being with a self-centered,

610
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,149
cold-blooded liar

611
00:33:10,425 --> 00:33:12,500
is never-ending torture.

612
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,080
Look at me.

613
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,750
I've given Rong Dingkun a son

614
00:33:19,075 --> 00:33:20,575
but I'm getting old and unattractive.

615
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,359
Even if I left him,

616
00:33:25,025 --> 00:33:26,439
I wouldn't know where to go.

617
00:33:34,175 --> 00:33:35,375
Dr. Feng,

618
00:33:35,525 --> 00:33:37,439
did you receive

619
00:33:37,439 --> 00:33:38,640
a handmade scarf?

620
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,000
Yes.

621
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,520
I gave it to you.

622
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:43,825
That...

623
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,560
Don't get me wrong.

624
00:33:45,725 --> 00:33:47,479
That was a thank-you gift.

625
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:49,785
I knew Rong Dingkun

626
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,925
had thanked you properly,

627
00:33:51,975 --> 00:33:52,825
but I wanted to

628
00:33:52,825 --> 00:33:54,575
do something

629
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,239
to express my gratitude

630
00:33:56,825 --> 00:33:58,160
for saving my life

631
00:33:59,075 --> 00:34:00,760
and waking me up.

632
00:34:01,975 --> 00:34:03,839
Despite my education,

633
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:05,800
I'm no different

634
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,959
from those traditional women.

635
00:34:07,425 --> 00:34:08,879
I even laughed at some

636
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,719
who fought for independence.

637
00:34:11,475 --> 00:34:12,675
Turns out,

638
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,550
I'm the biggest joke.

639
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,230
I appreciate your gift.

640
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:19,600
You and Mr. Rong

641
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,760
have been a couple

642
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:22,000
for a decade.

643
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,399
That means something.

644
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,199
Couples bicker all the time

645
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,650
but they'll soon make up.

646
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:29,575
We aren't a couple.

647
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,550
I'm just his concubine,

648
00:34:32,175 --> 00:34:33,415
not his wife.

649
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:36,010
Although being his wife

650
00:34:36,439 --> 00:34:38,520
isn't necessarily good.

651
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,800
Just look at Tang and Huang.

652
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:42,475
Their life isn't any easier than mine.

653
00:34:43,525 --> 00:34:45,100
Rong Dingkun

654
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,875
only loves himself.

655
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,399
He'll sacrifice his women and children

656
00:34:48,825 --> 00:34:50,585
if he has to.

657
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,459
Maybe Mr. Rong

658
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,150
has his reason.

659
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:57,399
Stop defending him!

660
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,600
As upright

661
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,120
and honest

662
00:35:01,175 --> 00:35:02,575
as he seems,

663
00:35:02,575 --> 00:35:03,725
he has evil associates everywhere.

664
00:35:03,975 --> 00:35:06,375
He's behind tons of dirty business.

665
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,320
The fire that destroyed your house

666
00:35:09,575 --> 00:35:11,520
and Wenchunli was no accident.

667
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:14,600
You...

668
00:35:16,025 --> 00:35:17,120
What are you talking about?

669
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,820
You don't know?

670
00:35:19,425 --> 00:35:20,439
I heard a lot

671
00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:21,825
about his shady deals

672
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,120
when serving him opium

673
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,900
with my sister.

674
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,019
Even his wife

675
00:35:26,019 --> 00:35:28,700
doesn't know as much as I do.

676
00:35:29,399 --> 00:35:30,425
Are you saying

677
00:35:31,325 --> 00:35:33,280
that fire was arranged?

678
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,399
It surely was.

679
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:35,399
Think about it.

680
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:36,919
Given the location of Wenchunli,

681
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:39,239
it wouldn't have been sold

682
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,600
that hastily

683
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,800
without that fire.

684
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,450
So

685
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,840
Rong Dingkun was behind it?

686
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,100
I'm not sure

687
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,775
but the company
building new houses there

688
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,280
is a subsidiary of Rong Company

689
00:35:52,825 --> 00:35:55,065
and they got the land

690
00:35:55,475 --> 00:35:57,325
from another company in a breeze.

691
00:35:57,375 --> 00:35:59,000
Who'd agree to such a deal?

692
00:35:59,100 --> 00:35:59,875
Does...

693
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,335
Does my sister know any of that?

694
00:36:02,335 --> 00:36:03,679
I don't know.

695
00:36:04,175 --> 00:36:06,250
But Rong Dingkun didn't like her.

696
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:08,125
She sensed that

697
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:09,600
and always kept a distance from him.

698
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,159
Mr. Jiashang, however, was fond of her

699
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:14,479
and tried to woo her

700
00:36:14,479 --> 00:36:15,325
but got rejected.

701
00:36:16,075 --> 00:36:18,156
His father told him to stop

702
00:36:18,156 --> 00:36:19,825
and he did

703
00:36:20,175 --> 00:36:22,600
and started to be more polite to her.

704
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,479
Apparently,

705
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I know nothing at all.

706
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,280
I've already said too much.

707
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:32,950
Just keep this conversation

708
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,579
between us.

709
00:36:49,825 --> 00:36:50,919
Mr. Rong,

710
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:52,520
Mr. Jiashang,

711
00:36:52,725 --> 00:36:54,005
welcome to my humble abode.

712
00:36:55,475 --> 00:36:56,514
Mr. Hashimoto.

713
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,075
Mr. Hashimoto,

714
00:36:58,475 --> 00:36:59,715
this visit is long overdue.

715
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,040
Here's a little something

716
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,025
for you.

717
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,760
This is too kind of you.

718
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,475
Allow me to introduce to you

719
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:06,316
my wife, Keiko.

720
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:08,600
And

721
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,679
my eldest son, Taichi.

722
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,279
You've met Taiji and Shiori.

723
00:37:13,279 --> 00:37:14,399
- Mr. Rong.
- Mr. Rong.

724
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:15,120
Good to see you again.

725
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,879
I found a treasure earlier

726
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,399
and I could use some opinions

727
00:37:26,025 --> 00:37:26,864
from

728
00:37:27,075 --> 00:37:29,125
another antique collector like you.

729
00:37:29,275 --> 00:37:31,876
Please take a look.

730
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,501
What you have here

731
00:37:35,501 --> 00:37:38,675
is a Ru ware dating back to
Emperor Huizong of Song.

732
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,740
It's famous for its grayish-blue glaze
resembling the sky after rain.

733
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,679
The glaze layer is a bit thick

734
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:45,120
and smooth.

735
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:46,439
It's thin

736
00:37:46,479 --> 00:37:47,750
around the edge

737
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,309
that the clay can be dimly seen.

738
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,000
Few pieces have survived to date.

739
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,080
This is indeed

740
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,525
one of a kind.

741
00:37:58,725 --> 00:38:00,446
I couldn't agree more.

742
00:38:00,525 --> 00:38:02,964
It caught my eyes the moment I saw it.

743
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,439
Mr. Hashimoto,

744
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:07,350
I heard

745
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:10,835
you also have a Gold Kylin.

746
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,239
Do I have the honor

747
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,159
to see it?

748
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,680
I can't say no to you.

749
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:28,325
Yes.

750
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:46,206
Mr. Rong,

751
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,450
here it is.

752
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:49,725
Do you mean this one?

753
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,400
It's beautiful!

754
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:22,600
I wonder

755
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,775
if you could sell it to us.

756
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,040
Just

757
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,760
name the price.

758
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:27,871
Mr. Rong,

759
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:29,840
it won't be a problem

760
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,750
if it's anything else,

761
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,839
but this Gold Kylin

762
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,004
isn't for sale.

763
00:39:41,325 --> 00:39:43,199
Does it

764
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,199
have a special significance

765
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:46,040
to you?

766
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,280
Your Chinese proverb says,

767
00:39:48,425 --> 00:39:50,320
"Children are debts."

768
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,800
To be honest with you,

769
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,200
my eldest one was born weak

770
00:39:55,575 --> 00:39:57,535
and said to die before 15.

771
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,080
But ever since I had this Gold Kylin,

772
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,350
he's been pulled back

773
00:40:02,625 --> 00:40:03,865
from death's door more than once

774
00:40:04,175 --> 00:40:05,400
and survived to this day.

775
00:40:05,925 --> 00:40:07,550
I was told

776
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:10,305
that it was a talisman

777
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,420
to keep my children safe.

778
00:40:12,925 --> 00:40:14,526
You're a father yourself.

779
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,461
We love our children, don't we?

780
00:40:16,775 --> 00:40:18,855
Nothing in the world

781
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,050
is more important than them.

782
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:22,639
Mr. Rong,

783
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,760
I hope

784
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,240
you can understand.

785
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,726
Of course,

786
00:40:28,825 --> 00:40:30,665
Mr. Hashimoto.

787
00:40:32,439 --> 00:40:34,199
We're working hard

788
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,225
so that they don't need to

789
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,800
worry about money

790
00:40:38,025 --> 00:40:40,906
and can live a peaceful life.

791
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,800
Thank you for your understanding.

792
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,600
Gentlemen don't take what others love,

793
00:40:46,879 --> 00:40:50,900
let alone such a special treasure.

794
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,000
You and I share the same hobby.

795
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:54,919
Your son and my daughter

796
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:56,760
first met in Chongqing

797
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:59,050
and found each other again in Shanghai.

798
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:02,679
What are the odds!

799
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,399
If we can become

800
00:41:04,399 --> 00:41:05,320
business partners,

801
00:41:05,479 --> 00:41:06,625
that'll be even better.

802
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:07,945
I agree.

803
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:09,015
Jiashang,

804
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:11,040
tell Mr. Hashimoto

805
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,600
about our business

806
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,959
and see if there's a chance
for us to cooperate.

807
00:41:14,959 --> 00:41:15,775
Yes.

808
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,475
Right now,

809
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,159
we have a shipping route

810
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:29,560
to your country

811
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,719
and two more to further destinations.

812
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,120
One is going south from Shanghai

813
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,199
to Nanyang

814
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:36,719
through Hong Kong.

815
00:41:37,158 --> 00:41:38,239
The other is

816
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:39,439
going through the Mediterranean Sea

817
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:41,754
to Britain, Germany

818
00:41:41,825 --> 00:41:43,000
and other European countries.

819
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:44,750
Here in the city,

820
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:45,650
we own

821
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:47,280
four wharfs, big and small.

822
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,560
Wharf 4

823
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,639
is the closest to the train station,

824
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:51,319
connecting shipping and land routes.

825
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,639
Most people think

826
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:55,360
Australia is desolate, barbarous,
and sparsely populated.

827
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:56,479
But in Australia,

828
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,320
the vast land

829
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,199
is suitable for livestock grazing.

830
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,159
A terrific amount of wool
is produced every year.

831
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:00,879
It's cheap, but of good quality.

832
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:04,199
In my opinion, we can import

833
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:05,398
a large order of wool from Australia,

834
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:08,320
find cheap factories in Nanyang

835
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,439
for rough processing

836
00:42:09,439 --> 00:42:11,125
and then transport it back for sale.

837
00:42:11,959 --> 00:42:15,040
The profits will be considerable.
