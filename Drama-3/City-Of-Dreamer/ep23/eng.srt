3
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,900
Oh, Shizhen,

4
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,425
you've stayed in the Rong family
for several months.

5
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,625
Who do you think it can be?

6
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,440
Boss?

7
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:52,700
No. This isn't his style.

8
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,225
Rong Dingkun's enemy,

9
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,090
(Right-hand Man Mr. Yang)
Yang Xiucheng.

10
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:59,800
He's in the doghouse now

11
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,000
and must hate Rong Dingkun's guts.

12
00:02:02,775 --> 00:02:04,936
No. It can't be him.

13
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,125
Then who was it?

14
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:08,439
I wonder

15
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:10,240
what that old fox Rong Dingkun
is going to do

16
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,400
after reading this.

17
00:02:11,775 --> 00:02:13,015
Will he deny

18
00:02:13,015 --> 00:02:14,759
or admit it?

19
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,566
You still have my word.

20
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,550
Give me more time.

21
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,559
I said I wouldn't let you down

22
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:25,479
and I'll keep my promise.

23
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,479
Could it be him?

24
00:02:28,925 --> 00:02:29,925
Are you with me, Shizhen?

25
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,550
Do you have a clue?

26
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,146
I'm as clueless as you.

27
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,720
Shixun,

28
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:37,730
you know,

29
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:38,850
we aren't the only victims

30
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,171
of the Wenchunli Fire.

31
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,400
They just broke the story.

32
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:42,975
Yes.

33
00:02:42,975 --> 00:02:44,200
We don't know what's next.

34
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,679
Let's wait and see

35
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:47,280
where it goes.

36
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,039
Sure.

37
00:02:48,225 --> 00:02:49,945
It's only a matter of time
before our parents find out.

38
00:02:49,945 --> 00:02:51,544
Maybe you should give them a heads-up

39
00:02:51,544 --> 00:02:53,145
in case they're caught unprepared.

40
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:54,586
Got it.

41
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:55,839
Shixun,

42
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:56,479
I'm going out.

43
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,320
See you later.

44
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,399
Go ahead.

45
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,080
Just eat without me.

46
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,701
Sure.

47
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:04,676
- Be careful.
- Em.

(Rong Dingkun Set Wenchunli on Fire
to Occupy the Land at Little Cost)

49
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,010
This...

50
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,679
Fanglin,

51
00:03:17,925 --> 00:03:19,639
is what they said

52
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,919
in the newspaper true?

53
00:03:21,775 --> 00:03:23,039
I don't know.

54
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,100
When I checked with Jiashang,

55
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,880
he didn't say anything

56
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,839
except that we'd better stay at home.

57
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:28,825
Don't go anywhere these days.

58
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,440
Miss Feng used to live there.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,360
She did say

60
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,000
the fire destroyed their house

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,440
and injured her father.

62
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,119
I can't imagine

63
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,880
her reaction to this article.

64
00:03:42,275 --> 00:03:43,350
Me neither.

65
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,350
But...

66
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,125
journalists aren't judges.

67
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,605
They have no right to convict anyone.

68
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,250
Fanglin,

69
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:52,600
who was it

70
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:54,639
that tipped them off?

71
00:03:56,775 --> 00:03:57,576
Look.

72
00:03:57,925 --> 00:03:59,290
(Right-hand Man Mr. Yang)
Here it says "Mr. Yang".

73
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,050
Yang Xiucheng?

74
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,875
I can't believe

75
00:04:13,425 --> 00:04:15,546
the Rongs did it!

76
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,880
If our neighbors find out

77
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:22,279
Shizhen worked for them,

78
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,775
that will be a disaster!

79
00:04:24,175 --> 00:04:24,974
Mother...

80
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,375
It's too soon to tell

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,600
how this is going to turn out.

82
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,679
Luckily,

83
00:04:31,325 --> 00:04:33,485
Shizhen got out in time.

84
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,850
My biggest fear

85
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,200
is those rumors.

86
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:40,605
Father, Mother,

87
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,890
I'm still in touch with
Mr. Zhang's second son.

88
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,320
I'll talk to him later

89
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,399
and figure out

90
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,480
a solution.

91
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,359
I'll get back

92
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:52,305
what they owe us and our neighbors.

93
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:53,300
Shixun,

94
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,486
listen,

95
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,399
do not join the crowd

96
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,160
to go after the Rongs, you hear me?

97
00:04:58,225 --> 00:04:58,880
Mother.

98
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,400
Our family has barely settled down.

99
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,359
We can't afford any more risks.

100
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,119
Rong Dingkun is rich and powerful.

101
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,600
Fighting against him

102
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,279
could cost you

103
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,675
your job!

104
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,341
Don't forget your sister

105
00:05:12,341 --> 00:05:14,400
was his children's governess.

106
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,880
Once she's dragged into this mess,

107
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,760
her reputation will be ruined

108
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,359
or...

109
00:05:19,475 --> 00:05:21,040
or worse, her life!

110
00:05:22,075 --> 00:05:23,575
That's a valid concern.

111
00:05:23,775 --> 00:05:24,575
Right now,

112
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,409
we don't know if he did it

113
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,079
without evidence.

114
00:05:28,675 --> 00:05:29,640
And

115
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,959
Rong Dingkun hasn't said anything.

116
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,200
Things could go either way.

117
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,640
Sound out

118
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,239
our old neighbors on their attitudes.

119
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,740
I will.

120
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,670
But no way

121
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,000
will Rong Dingkun admit to anything.

122
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,000
So,

123
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:07,445
what brings you here?

124
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,250
It's nothing serious.

125
00:06:10,825 --> 00:06:12,344
I hate to bother you,

126
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,941
but...

127
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:16,900
I'm baffled.

128
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,994
By this news article?

129
00:06:24,994 --> 00:06:25,825
(Rong Dingkun Set Wenchunli on Fire
to Occupy the Land at Little Cost)

130
00:06:26,225 --> 00:06:27,306
What I can tell you is

131
00:06:27,725 --> 00:06:28,600
I didn't do it.

132
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:33,836
I thought so.

133
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,350
You did?

134
00:06:36,925 --> 00:06:38,455
There's always a purpose

135
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,000
for everything you do.

136
00:06:40,475 --> 00:06:42,119
Making the Wenchunli Fire public

137
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,239
would tarnish Rong Dingkun's image

138
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,519
and hit the stocks of his company.

139
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,320
Were it you,

140
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,760
you'd attack him from all angles

141
00:06:50,825 --> 00:06:53,079
to take him down once and for all.

142
00:06:54,525 --> 00:06:57,320
But now isn't the time

143
00:06:58,425 --> 00:06:59,839
for an all-out attack.

144
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,925
Besides,

145
00:07:01,775 --> 00:07:03,495
had you had such a plan,

146
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,010
you wouldn't have
left me out of the loop.

147
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,679
You have a clear

148
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:11,519
and analytical mind

149
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,359
and

150
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,650
you know me all too well.

151
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,440
Thanks.

152
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,399
It was

153
00:07:17,775 --> 00:07:19,800
your lovey-dovey suitor, Rong Jiashang,

154
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:20,799
who sacrificed his family

155
00:07:21,075 --> 00:07:22,200
for love.

156
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,320
You did well, Shizhen.

157
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,315
Let's see what will happen to you two.

158
00:07:32,825 --> 00:07:33,640
You can elope.

159
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,200
But the real question is

160
00:07:36,675 --> 00:07:38,275
will Rong Jiashang go with you?

161
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,600
And

162
00:07:41,175 --> 00:07:42,480
will you change your mind

163
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,930
halfway?

164
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,799
If you do, come back anytime.

165
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,679
I'll take care of you.

166
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,920
There are plenty of men

167
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,079
out there,

168
00:07:53,025 --> 00:07:54,640
but a talent like you

169
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,000
is one of a kind.

170
00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:00,125
I'm flattered.

(Rong Dingkun Set Wenchunli on Fire

172

00:08:06,975 --> 00:08:08,415
it wasn't me.

174

Ruining your image

176
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:15,959
would do me no good.

177

I'm your little stooge,

A senior clansman

181

was misled by the paper

182
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:27,850
and yelled at me on the phone earlier,

183
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,799
threatening to expel me.

184
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:32,239
My family still depends on our clan.

185
00:08:33,175 --> 00:08:34,574
I wouldn't stab you in the back

you'll sink deeper.

Uncle,

190
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,840
I'll get to the bottom of this

191
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,679
and find whoever did it.

192
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,559

is behind everything?

194
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,600
It could be

195
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,069
Miss Feng who just left.

196
00:09:04,775 --> 00:09:05,919
I'm listening.

197
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:07,775
It couldn't be a coincidence

198
00:09:08,359 --> 00:09:10,375
that she came to work for us

199
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:13,150
right after we burned down her house.

200
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,679
Ever since she arrived,

201
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,479
so many unexpected things

202
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,975
have happened.

203
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:21,200
None of them is linked to her,

204
00:09:21,275 --> 00:09:23,434
but she had the run of the house

205
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,101
and was on good terms with the servants.

206
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,840
Who knows how much she's found about us?

207
00:09:28,075 --> 00:09:29,195
And the timing is most suspicious

208
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,549
that this scandal was published

209
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,700
right after she quit.

210
00:09:37,675 --> 00:09:39,000
So all in all,

211
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,079
it's a woman's fault?

212
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,991
Xiucheng,

213
00:09:44,275 --> 00:09:46,354
you're an educated college graduate.

214
00:09:46,425 --> 00:09:48,545
Why are you blaming everything on women

215
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,325
like the old school?

216
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,559
Jiashang,

217
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,565
I know you like her,

218
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,770
but don't let emotions
cloud your judgment

219
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,171
and cover for her.

220
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,200
I do like her,

221
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:08,840
but it was you and Mrs. Rong

222
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,960
who hired her in the first place.

223
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,415
Had you known she couldn't be trusted,

224
00:10:12,575 --> 00:10:13,900
why would you have let her in

225
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,844
to teach us?

226
00:10:15,425 --> 00:10:16,506
That makes me question

227
00:10:16,506 --> 00:10:17,700
your intention!

228
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,850
We hired her

229
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,400
because we suspected her motives

230
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,640
and let her in to watch her closely.

231
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,670
You're a terrible liar!

232
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,089
You're trying to

233
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:28,488
pin the blame on her

234
00:10:28,488 --> 00:10:30,327
for all that's happened, aren't you?

235
00:10:31,025 --> 00:10:32,306
Then let me ask you this.

236
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:33,719
She might've

237
00:10:34,075 --> 00:10:35,520
talked Sun Shaoqing into escaping.

238
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,489
Yes.

239
00:10:36,525 --> 00:10:37,719
But what about Zhihui?

240
00:10:38,575 --> 00:10:39,736
What did she have anything to do

241
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,119
with her action?

242
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:45,300
We checked her

243
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,200
over and over

244
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,279
before and after she was hired.

245
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,435
We had her tailed

246
00:10:51,575 --> 00:10:52,936
and gave her a polygraph test

247
00:10:52,975 --> 00:10:54,576
which she passed.

248
00:10:55,025 --> 00:10:56,624
That article includes details

249
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,700
such as the shell company.

250
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,000
I don't believe a governess like her

251
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,050
could dig that deep.

252
00:11:02,025 --> 00:11:02,945
Xiucheng,

253
00:11:04,825 --> 00:11:06,465
I trust that you didn't leak anything,

254
00:11:06,725 --> 00:11:08,525
but you can't make her a scapegoat

255
00:11:08,525 --> 00:11:10,165
before finding the real leaker.

256
00:11:10,165 --> 00:11:11,045
Enough!

257
00:11:12,025 --> 00:11:13,800
Stop the blame game.

258
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,400
What we need is a solution.

259
00:11:18,925 --> 00:11:21,165
We've become the talk of the town.

260
00:11:21,475 --> 00:11:23,514
Reporters are outside our house.

261
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,760
We can't even go out.

262
00:11:26,025 --> 00:11:26,950
Other than that,

263
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,140
victims of the fire

264
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,771
are coming after us.

265
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,725
What can

266
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,800
those peasants do?

267
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:38,025
They don't know

268
00:11:38,025 --> 00:11:39,050
who they're messing with.

269
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,690
So...

270
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,919
We've hired tons of musclemen

271
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,050
to do their job.

272
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,690
Keep an eye on those people.

273
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,450
Take care of all the troublemakers.

274
00:11:47,575 --> 00:11:49,454
Break them or kill them.

275
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,210
And I need you

276
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,185
to track down the mastermind, Xiucheng.

277
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,110
I need to know who that enemy is.

278
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,020
Consider it done.

279
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,825
I'll bring that guy to you

280
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,899
at all costs.

281
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,364
What about those reporters?

282
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:12,650
Jiashang,

283
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,559
you and Yunchi are friends.

284
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,275
Tell him

285
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,039
to say someone else did it,

286
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,960
not us.

287
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,919
We need the media to be on our side.

288
00:12:22,425 --> 00:12:23,479
Violence

289
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:24,775
is one way to vent out your anger,

290
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,575
but I don't think

291
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,041
it's the best way.

292
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,959
Why?

293
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,825
The one behind is fanning the flame.

294
00:12:33,975 --> 00:12:35,250
There's no way to put it out quietly.

295
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,145
Now that

296
00:12:37,225 --> 00:12:38,625
all the eyes are on us,

297
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,040
if anything happens to those victims,

298
00:12:41,275 --> 00:12:43,625
we'll be the first to blame.

299
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,650
And things will get worse.

300
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,599
Whatever we say won't matter anymore.

301
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,559
The suspect is still out there

302
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:51,825
in the dark

303
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:52,915
while we remain an open target.

304
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,490
The longer this mess drags on,

305
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,529
the bigger it grows

306
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:57,049
and the worse we look.

307
00:12:57,925 --> 00:12:58,685
Father,

308
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,125
the priority

309
00:13:00,175 --> 00:13:01,615
is to dissociate ourselves

310
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,251
from this matter as soon as possible.

311
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,500
Mhmm.

312
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,071
You have a point.

313
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,825
But how?

314
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,275
What should we do?

315
00:13:13,775 --> 00:13:14,494
Father,

316
00:13:15,225 --> 00:13:16,525
I'll handle it

317
00:13:16,525 --> 00:13:18,084
if you trust me.

318
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,950
It'll blow over

319
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:21,599
in three days,

320
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,600
but

321
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,300
at a cost.

322
00:13:25,225 --> 00:13:26,375
Money is never a problem.

323
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,820
Alright.

324
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,574
Just get it done.

325
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:33,880
You may leave. I'm tired.

326
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,839
Yes.

327
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:51,159
Did Boss say anything?

328
00:13:55,275 --> 00:13:56,760
I read the paper

329
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,650
and I was worried about you.

330
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,450
I'm fine.

331
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,825
You know who did it?

332
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,825
It was Rong Jiashang.

333
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,619
Shizhen,

334
00:14:15,325 --> 00:14:16,760
isn't this

335
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,039
what you've been working so hard for?

336
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,239
Do you think

337
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,750
he'll coarse his father
into pleading guilty for you?

338
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,039
I'm not sure.

339
00:14:32,575 --> 00:14:33,495
Shizhen,

340
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,200
you do have

341
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:36,825
expectations in your relationship.

342
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,130
Baoli.

343
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,125
Yes?

344
00:14:40,525 --> 00:14:42,300
It's getting harder and harder

345
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,175
to tell how I feel about him.

346
00:14:46,175 --> 00:14:47,275
Look,

347
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,510
you're already in love with him.

348
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,491
Rong Jiashang belongs to the sky.

349
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,475
His dream is to be a pilot.

350
00:14:55,725 --> 00:14:57,325
If you were right,

351
00:14:59,075 --> 00:15:00,599
I'd be seeing the man I love

352
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,080
rolling into the deep

353
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,559
without doing anything

354
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,799
and I even...

355
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,610
Alright, alright.

356
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,080
Calm down. Let it go.

357
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,679
(Tea)

358
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:17,750
Steamed buns!

359
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,350
- I'm going to play with my friends.
- Hot steamed buns!

360
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,600
- Sure. Don't run around.
- Take your time, Miss.

361
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,125
Yes.

362
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,245
They're all fresh.

363
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,900
Shixun,

364
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
aren't you going to work?

365
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,760
I'm having a day off.

366
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,039
Shizhen,

367
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,685
let's go to a meeting.

368
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,000
What meeting?

369
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,375
Where is he?

370
00:15:45,575 --> 00:15:46,525
Got it?

371
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:57,850
Shixun.

372
00:15:58,559 --> 00:15:59,150
Welcome.

373
00:15:59,150 --> 00:15:59,800
Hello.

374
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,359
Good to have you here.

375
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,599
Let me introduce to you,

376
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:03,840
my sister, Shizhen.

377
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:05,599
Shizhen,

378
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,679
meet Editor Zhang of People's Weekly.

379
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,679
We went to the same college.

380
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:10,625
Nice to meet you.

381
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,550
Same here.

382
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,239
Have a seat.

383
00:16:13,275 --> 00:16:13,960
- Thanks.
- Sure.

384
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,559
Go ahead.

385
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,000
Let's get started.

386
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,125
Let's go. Take a seat.

387
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,200
(Tea for Friends)

388
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,119
Guys,

389
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,799
Dr. Feng and I

390
00:16:26,925 --> 00:16:29,599
have discussed this matter

391
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:30,999
more than once.

392
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:32,569
We don't know

393
00:16:32,569 --> 00:16:34,129
who's using the media
against Rong Dingkun,

394
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,400
but it plays right into our hands.

395
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,320
- That's right.
- Agreed.

396
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,200
The problem is

397
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,825
it's difficult

398
00:16:41,675 --> 00:16:43,039
to push forward

399
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,440
from where we are now.

400
00:16:44,925 --> 00:16:45,760
That's true.

401
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,540
The evidence is lacking

402
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:50,080
and Rong Dingkun is too powerful.

403
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,960
The government is knee-deep in the war

404
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,919
and corruption.

405
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,075
No one is there

406
00:16:54,075 --> 00:16:55,435
to uphold justice.

407
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,880
Then why are we here?

408
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,719
We can't do anything

409
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,150
other than condemn him in the paper.

410
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,239
That won't hurt him at all.

411
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:03,840
- Don't you agree?
- Yes.

412
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,640
- Right.
- That's true.

413
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,800
He'll still be a big boss,

414
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,040
raking in dirty money

415
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,325
while we remain down and out

416
00:17:09,325 --> 00:17:10,599
with broken legs.

417
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,325
Am I right?

418
00:17:11,325 --> 00:17:12,439
- Yes.
- That's right.

419
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:13,175
What to do?

420
00:17:13,175 --> 00:17:15,104
Better not provoke him,

421
00:17:15,104 --> 00:17:16,875
or there might be direr consequences.

422
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,019
- Absolutely!
- Of course.

423
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,910
We aren't the snitch.

424
00:17:21,175 --> 00:17:23,055
What if Rong Dingkun thinks we are

425
00:17:23,325 --> 00:17:25,319
and gets back at us?

426
00:17:25,925 --> 00:17:27,050
- Yes.
- Then what?

427
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,439
He'll crush us!

428
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:31,475
Yes. We aren't his match.

429
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,850
We can't afford the consequences.

430
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:34,760
Enough!

431
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,560
Guys,

432
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,800
have you forgotten

433
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,075
about all our suffering

434
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,331
and pain?

435
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,039
How could we?

436
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,079
Right.

437
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,800
We weren't rich

438
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,600
but we were doing fine.

439
00:17:52,025 --> 00:17:53,275
- But
- Yes.

440
00:17:53,275 --> 00:17:55,075
that sudden fire

441
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,700
changed everything.

442
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,119
Mr. Li,

443
00:18:03,175 --> 00:18:05,175
you were blinded by the smoke

444
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,200
and could no longer teach.

445
00:18:11,475 --> 00:18:12,280
Ms. Wang,

446
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,825
your son and daughter

447
00:18:15,825 --> 00:18:17,171
were both killed in it.

448
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,740
Mr. Huang,

449
00:18:21,275 --> 00:18:23,079
after the beam broke your leg,

450
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,425
you lost your job

451
00:18:24,425 --> 00:18:25,706
and

452
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,920
your wife.

453
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,700
I'm not bringing this up

454
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,479
to reopen your old wounds

455
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:35,725
and upset you,

456
00:18:35,975 --> 00:18:37,239
but to remind you

457
00:18:37,239 --> 00:18:38,950
how much that fire took from us.

458
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,300
It took our family, our life

459
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,025
and everything we had.

460
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,575
Don't you want revenge?

461
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,106
Don't you hold a grudge?

462
00:18:50,025 --> 00:18:50,826
Or,

463
00:18:50,826 --> 00:18:52,719
would you put it behind,

464
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,920
let it go

465
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,575
and move on with your life?

466
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,401
Uh...

467
00:18:58,475 --> 00:19:00,274
Rong Dingkun must pay for what he did!

468
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,154
I'm all alone.

469
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:03,680
I could put my life on the line

470
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,225
to get revenge on him.

471
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:06,865
No one else would get hurt.

472
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:09,880
But you're different.

473
00:19:10,075 --> 00:19:12,435
You all have a family.

474
00:19:12,975 --> 00:19:14,000
- Shixun,
- That's right.

475
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,160
you have parents and a sister.

476
00:19:16,575 --> 00:19:17,494
I don't think

477
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,155
you'll risk your life

478
00:19:19,275 --> 00:19:20,315
to battle Rong Dingkun, right?

479
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:22,100
Don't you think so?

480
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,520
- Yes.
- Right.

481
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,000
Just try to be understanding.

482
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:27,899
Yes.

483
00:19:28,025 --> 00:19:29,289
We hate his guts,

484
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,349
but we can't act on impulse.

485
00:19:32,475 --> 00:19:36,115
We're either old or disabled.

486
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,949
If it were just us,

487
00:19:37,949 --> 00:19:39,275
we'd do anything

488
00:19:39,275 --> 00:19:40,650
to destroy that man

489
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,160
because we had nothing to lose.

490
00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:43,319
- Yes!
- Of course!

491
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:44,700
- But in reality,
- Battle it out!

492
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,375
we... We're the pillar of our family.

493
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,075
So...

494
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,450
But...

495
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:53,525
That's why

496
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,950
Dr. Feng invited me over.

497
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,021
If we can't take legal action

498
00:19:58,021 --> 00:19:59,479
against Rong Dingkun,

499
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:00,040
the alternative

500
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,925
is to bring him to his knees

501
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,479
with public opinion.

502
00:20:03,575 --> 00:20:05,040
Will that work?

503
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,640
Yes. Will it succeed?

504
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,400
No way.

505
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,599
Public opinion?

506
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,599
Even the law can't do anything.

507
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:11,625
- Hear me out.
- That's right.

508
00:20:12,275 --> 00:20:13,079
With

509
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,359
the scandal trending

510
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:16,599
and the evidence we have,

511
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,839
there's enough leverage
for negotiations.

512
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:19,775
Don't you agree?

513
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,100
Am I right?

514
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:23,560
Sounds about right, but...

515
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,199
That's not bad, but...

516
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:26,040
Yes. That's right.

517
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,199
They must pay for our losses.

518
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:28,600
We can't sit and do nothing.

519
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:31,079
I lost three family members!

520
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:32,920
Rong Dingkun must kneel

521
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,775
and apologize to the deceased.

522
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,015
- That's right! Kneel and apologize!
- Yes! Kneel and apologize!

523
00:20:35,015 --> 00:20:36,025
- Let's go!
- Yes! He must do that!

524
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:37,319
Let's go to his house

525
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,175
to make him pay for what he did!

526
00:20:39,175 --> 00:20:40,384
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

527
00:20:40,384 --> 00:20:41,839
- Wait! Calm down!
- Guys, guys!

528
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,079
You can't show up at his door

529
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:45,920
without a negotiation plan

530
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,025
and a negotiator.

531
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,479
Negotiation?

532
00:20:49,479 --> 00:20:50,438
Negotiator?

533
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,390
I got this. Sit back.

534
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,550
Sure.

535
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:55,900
I've done

536
00:20:57,719 --> 00:20:58,719
negotiations before.

537
00:20:58,719 --> 00:20:59,800
I can do it.

538
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,650
You can't even drive a bargain,

539
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,520
let alone negation.

540
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,560
Look,

541
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,400
I'm the one for the job.

542
00:21:06,425 --> 00:21:07,599
Mr. Liu,

543
00:21:07,825 --> 00:21:10,000
you owe more money than us.

544
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,075
You're the neediest.

545
00:21:11,075 --> 00:21:12,156
What if

546
00:21:12,156 --> 00:21:13,575
Rong Dingkun pays you

547
00:21:13,575 --> 00:21:15,150
to betray us?

548
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,725
What's that supposed to mean?

549
00:21:16,725 --> 00:21:18,500
- You don't trust me?
- Just ask others.

550
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,520
- Let's hear what they have to say.
- You're ridiculous!

551
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,839
Am I right?

552
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,319
Calm down. Stop arguing.

553
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,550
I'm sorry.

554
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,019
They weren't

555
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:30,050
like this.

556
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,154
- Watch your mouth!
- Misfortune

557
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,350
can turn people into what they aren't.

558
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,475
You brat!

559
00:21:34,475 --> 00:21:36,119
The poorer they get,

560
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:38,050
the greedier they become.

561
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:38,950
Are you suspecting me?

562
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:39,800
That's human nature.

563
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,750
- You got me wrong.
- He's right.

564
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,470
It's for everyone's sake!

565
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,920
- I'd never do that!
- Stop, all of you!

566
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,361
You can't read or write

567
00:21:45,361 --> 00:21:47,359
but Dr. Feng has studied abroad.

568
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:49,479
He should be our negotiator.

569
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,000
Foreign education

570
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,599
doesn't make him better than us!

571
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:53,280
Don't forget

572
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,959
his sister used to teach

573
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:56,280
Rong Dingkun's children.

574
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:57,040
How can you be sure

575
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,599
that they aren't on the same side?

576
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,875
Yes.

577
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,000
She's having an affair

578
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,040
with his eldest son.

579
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,000
What if she takes our money

580
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,959
to pay for her dowries?

581
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:06,700
Ma'am,

582
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,179
that's ridiculous.

583
00:22:08,179 --> 00:22:09,560
My sister has

584
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,760
nothing to do with the Rongs.

585
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:12,599
How are we supposed to trust you?

586
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:14,800
Your sister did work for them,

587
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,920
didn't she?

588
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,239
Stop denying it!

589
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:18,800
You can't bend the truth.

590
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,400
Knock it off!

591
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,780
Dr. Feng

592
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,620
is one of us, isn't he?

593
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,540
He's trying to help us,

594
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:29,125
yet you're divided on your own agenda

595
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,280
and speaking ill of his sister.

596
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,400
You seemed to be all nice and kind

597
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,160
before anything happened,

598
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,400
but that fire

599
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,600
has burned out your true colors.

600
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,625
We... We didn't mean to hurt anyone.

601
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,280
Who are they?

602
00:22:50,439 --> 00:22:51,775
Why are they here?

603
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,319
You're right.

604
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,654
Solidarity is the foundation of success.

605
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,239
A divided group

606
00:23:00,439 --> 00:23:01,825
can't get anything done.

607
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:05,850
Rong Jiashang!

608
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,725
How did you find us?

609
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,325
Rong Jiashang?

610
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:10,610
Is he

611
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:11,800
Rong Dingkun's son?

612
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:13,439
How dare you show up!

613
00:23:13,575 --> 00:23:14,650
- We were about to go to your place!
- Yes!

614
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,150
And here you are!

615
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,640
He can't leave

616
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,975
until he gives us

617
00:23:18,975 --> 00:23:20,341
- what we need!
- Yes!

618
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:21,933
- He can't go!
- We can't let him go!

619
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,374
We demand an explanation!

620
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:25,000
What are you doing?

621
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,100
What is this?

622
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:30,295
We're here to talk.

623
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,900
Don't scare them.

624
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,830
Rumor has it

625
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:38,775
that my father sent people

626
00:23:38,925 --> 00:23:40,445
to set Wenchunli on fire

627
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,560
to obtain the land.

628
00:23:44,275 --> 00:23:45,714
I'm here

629
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:48,306
to explain everything to you.

630
00:23:49,325 --> 00:23:50,560
Back then,

631
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,900
he did have his eyes on the land

632
00:23:53,439 --> 00:23:55,400
but gave it up

633
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,471
for its high cost.

634
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,319
Someone else burned it

635
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:01,040
and gave it to my father

636
00:24:01,325 --> 00:24:02,599
to pay off his huge debts.

637
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:04,236
So,

638
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,421
my father didn't do it.

639
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,150
- Liar!
- Yes!

640
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,525
- Why should we believe you?
- Right.

641
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,125
- Your father did it!
- Stop twisting the facts!

642
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:12,885
Well,

643
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,575
given my father's experience,

644
00:24:15,025 --> 00:24:17,146
I'd be lying if I said

645
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,250
he didn't suspect a thing.

646
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:21,844
He took that land

647
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,821
without asking too much

648
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,275
for profits,

649
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,319
which got him into trouble now.

650
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,180
I believe

651
00:24:29,575 --> 00:24:31,200
he's learned from his mistake.

652
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:33,760
I apologize

653
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:36,225
for barging into

654
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,959
your meeting,

655
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,600
but I meant to get things straight

656
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,151
and

657
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,970
offer you

658
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,490
compensation.

659
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,520
- Compensation?
- What?

660
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,197
- Will they pay us?
- Compensation?

661
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,525
- Really?
- Is that true?

662
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:53,280
Really?

663
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:55,675
Mr. Rong Jiashang,

664
00:24:56,025 --> 00:24:57,824
nice story.

665
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,439
You could make a career

666
00:24:59,439 --> 00:25:00,680
out of it.

667
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,635
If it's true that the one in debt

668
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,341
to your father did it,

669
00:25:07,475 --> 00:25:08,715
get him here

670
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,949
to corroborate your statement.

671
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:11,920
- Yes! That's right!
- Get him here.

672
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,119
- Where is he?
- Let him testify.

673
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:14,119
- Too bad,
- Yes.

674
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,880
he also owed the Green Gang

675
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,500
who killed him six months ago.

676
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,550
- What?
- A dead man can't talk.

677
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,920
I've submitted all the necessary files,

678
00:25:22,199 --> 00:25:23,719
documents and evidence

679
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,599
to the police.

680
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:27,599
If you still have doubts,

681
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:30,319
check with them yourselves.

682
00:25:30,439 --> 00:25:31,079
We...

683
00:25:31,275 --> 00:25:32,755
Basically,

684
00:25:33,775 --> 00:25:35,096
no one is there to confirm your story.

685
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:39,276
You could say that,

686
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I guess.

687
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,000
How are we supposed to believe

688
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,319
your father is innocent?

689
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,040
You can't prove

690
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,621
he's guilty, either.

691
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:53,760
If your father didn't do it,

692
00:25:54,075 --> 00:25:55,436
why are you here?

693
00:25:55,925 --> 00:25:56,750
Yes.

694
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:58,880
Why would he come if they're innocent?

695
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,625
What's he here for?

696
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,800
Why is he here?

697
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,599
They're guilty.

698
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:04,325
Guys,

699
00:26:05,575 --> 00:26:07,405
my father didn't arrange that fire.

700
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:09,760
But he did

701
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:11,479
push the arsonist too hard

702
00:26:11,719 --> 00:26:13,000
who went to extremes.

703
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,280
We're sorry for your loss

704
00:26:15,525 --> 00:26:17,225
and my father and I have decided

705
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,920
to make up for it.

706
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,760
How hypocritical!

707
00:26:22,225 --> 00:26:23,866
The killer is playing nice

708
00:26:24,175 --> 00:26:26,695
to the bereaved.

709
00:26:27,325 --> 00:26:28,085
Rong Jiashang,

710
00:26:28,675 --> 00:26:30,400
you're as despicable as your father.

711
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,599
Miss Feng...

712
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,560
Stop!

713
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,901
I know

714
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,439
words alone

715
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,179
can't comfort you.

716
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,800
Bring it in.

717
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,560
What is it?

718
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,200
What...? What's that?

719
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,520
Gold bars!

720
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,160
For real?

721
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,400
These gold bars.

722
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,079
Is it real gold?

723
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,119
They are labeled

724
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:06,475
and can be sold anytime.

725
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:09,359
One gold bar equals

726
00:27:09,725 --> 00:27:11,319
approximately 300 silver dollars.

727
00:27:11,479 --> 00:27:13,000
- 300?
- That much?

728
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,400
You'll get one once you sign

729
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,000
the Statement of Understanding.

730
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:19,280
The disabled ones

731
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:20,560
or those who lost
their friends or family

732
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,800
will get one more

733
00:27:22,199 --> 00:27:23,375
once confirmed by their neighbors.

734
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,520
I promise

735
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,590
that we'll take responsibility.

736
00:27:28,175 --> 00:27:29,334
Our offer is fair and reasonable

737
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:31,375
to everyone.

738
00:27:33,425 --> 00:27:34,275
Really?

739
00:27:34,275 --> 00:27:35,435
Rong Jiashang

740
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:37,160
is good.

741
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,520
You can put a price on lost property,

742
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:40,891
but life?

743
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,071
One life

744
00:27:43,825 --> 00:27:45,344
for one gold bar?

745
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:46,575
But now,

746
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:48,479
the Rongs aren't admitting to arson

747
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,199
or murder.

748
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:52,920
They're

749
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,079
buying off the victims

750
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,439
to make this thing go away.

751
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,850
Or

752
00:27:57,439 --> 00:27:58,959
why sign the Statement of Understanding?

753
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,640
So,

754
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:02,920
young as Rong Jiashang seems,

755
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,319
he's sophisticated.

756
00:28:04,675 --> 00:28:05,474
Obviously,

757
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,119
your neighbors

758
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,680
want revenge

759
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:11,000
but the odds are against us.

760
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,359
Justice

761
00:28:12,439 --> 00:28:14,520
is no more useful than gold.

762
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:17,175
Are we letting Rong Dingkun go?

763
00:28:18,975 --> 00:28:19,975
Miss Feng,

764
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,479
I'm on your side,

765
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,775
but

766
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,239
look at them.

767
00:28:24,925 --> 00:28:26,040
They care more

768
00:28:26,475 --> 00:28:27,835
about their benefit.

769
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,959
They're counting on

770
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,599
Rong Dingkun's money

771
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,719
to improve their life

772
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,640
instead of bringing him to justice.

773
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,839
You and your brother

774
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:38,040
won't give up

775
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,179
until justice is served,

776
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:40,680
but all they want

777
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:42,920
is food and clothes.

778
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,400
We need to survive.

779
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,560
I have a big family.

780
00:28:51,425 --> 00:28:52,825
I'm in desperate need of money.

781
00:28:52,975 --> 00:28:53,934
I'll sign it.

782
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,280
300 silver dollars

783
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,479
is enough to buy a small house

784
00:29:04,479 --> 00:29:05,359
and put us

785
00:29:05,725 --> 00:29:07,425
through this year.

786
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,079
The Rongs are generous.

787
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:13,719
We don't have to put up a fight.

788
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,119
All we need is to sign that paper.

789
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:15,925
I'll do it.

790
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,319
Me too.

791
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:18,199
Yes, just sign it.

792
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:19,439
Better stay away from trouble.

793
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,711
Sign it and let it go.

794
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,800
Yes. You're right.

795
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:25,680
Let's sign it

796
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,800
with Ms. Sun.

797
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:31,079
I'll sign it, too.

798
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,880
- Come here.
- Don't push.

799
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,319
It'll soon be your turn.

800
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,680
One at a time.

801
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,425
He's got it!

802
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,000
- Yes!
- Sign it.

803
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,750
Look!

804
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:48,239
Shizhen!

805
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:49,575
There's gold for everyone.

806
00:29:49,575 --> 00:29:50,225
Shizhen!

807
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,250
Shixun,

808
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,479
let her go.

809
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,680
Your sister

810
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,079
knows what she's doing.

811
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,340
No one died in our family,

812
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:01,706
but we lost a big house

813
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,360
and a two-door wide store.

814
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:04,871
Mr. Rong Jiashang,

815
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:06,400
what's all that worth?

816
00:30:07,275 --> 00:30:08,636
Given your condition,

817
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:11,880
your compensation should be doubled.

818
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,141
Your family is powerful
and well-connected.

819
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,590
It's generous of you

820
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,350
to silence us with gold bars.

821
00:30:20,325 --> 00:30:21,845
As your governess,

822
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:24,280
I should support you.

823
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,450
(Statement of Understanding)

824
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:35,250
(Signature: Feng Shizhen)

825
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,550
Shixun,

826
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,439
take them.

827
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,800
Shizhen,

828
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:43,119
are you out of your mind?

829
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:43,760
Miss Feng!

830
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:46,400
Shizhen!

831
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,000
Miss Feng!

832
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,600
Miss Feng!

833
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,680
Now what?

834
00:30:55,925 --> 00:30:57,475
You want your money back?

835
00:30:58,850 --> 00:30:59,675
Miss Feng,

836
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,400
I'm doing my best to make it up to you

837
00:31:01,675 --> 00:31:03,075
and I want everyone to be happy,

838
00:31:03,275 --> 00:31:04,079
but I...

839
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:05,400
I'd take your word for it

840
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,160
if you didn't know the truth,

841
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,751
but you do know everything.

842
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:10,199
Rong Jiashang,

843
00:31:10,479 --> 00:31:11,599
I'm so disappointed in you.

844
00:31:12,199 --> 00:31:13,675
I know you still hold a grudge,

845
00:31:13,675 --> 00:31:15,479
but this is the best I can do.

846
00:31:15,479 --> 00:31:17,680
If your enemy shamed you with money,

847
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:19,600
would you still be nice to him?

848
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:22,875
Miss Feng,

849
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,460
I'll take care of those

850
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:27,050
who set the fire.

851
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,199
Because you can't do anything

852
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,125
to the one who gave them the order.

853
00:31:32,025 --> 00:31:33,105
Rong Jiashang,

854
00:31:33,439 --> 00:31:34,199
if we

855
00:31:34,199 --> 00:31:35,425
swap places,

856
00:31:35,525 --> 00:31:36,319
you'll understand

857
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:37,959
how I feel.

858
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:40,319
If my father burned your house

859
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,359
and I came to hand out money

860
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,680
to shut you up,

861
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,575
hoping you'd still be with me,

862
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,959
would you

863
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,541
agree to that?

864
00:31:51,199 --> 00:31:51,880
Shizhen,

865
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,175
do I have to cut all ties with my family

866
00:31:58,525 --> 00:32:00,284
to get a chance with you?

867
00:32:05,025 --> 00:32:06,346
But you won't.

868
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,430
It's not that

869
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:09,950
you can't,

870
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,600
but I don't deserve such sacrifice.

871
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,030
Come in.

872
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:03,199
Mr. Rong,

873
00:33:03,199 --> 00:33:05,000
a Miss Hashimoto is here.

874
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,439
Miss Hashimoto,

875
00:33:27,275 --> 00:33:28,915
what can I do for you?

876
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,640
I wouldn't dare trouble you.

877
00:33:32,325 --> 00:33:34,800
I'm here for a sensitive matter

878
00:33:34,925 --> 00:33:35,881
involving your family.

879
00:33:35,881 --> 00:33:37,121
It's not my place to interfere,

880
00:33:37,719 --> 00:33:39,500
but I care about Jiashang.

881
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,800
He's a victim of deception.

882
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,640
I don't want him

883
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,899
to get hurt

884
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,300
or you suffer any losses.

885
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,560
You're my son's friend

886
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:57,750
which makes you sort of a family.

887
00:33:58,025 --> 00:34:00,040
You can tell me

888
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,731
anything.

889
00:34:20,325 --> 00:34:21,484
Two weeks ago,

890
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:24,125
when Taiji and I
went to Hangzhou for visiting,

891
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,520
we accidentally ran into

892
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,750
Miss Du and her friend in the hotel

893
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:31,331
and snapped this photo.

894
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:32,719
Mr. Rong,

895
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,950
don't get me wrong.

896
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,760
I didn't do it out of jealousy

897
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,540
or mean to go between them.

898
00:34:39,439 --> 00:34:42,600
Taiji asked me
to send it to you anonymously,

899
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,050
but after careful consideration,

900
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I'd rather talk to you openly

901
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,225
than gossip behind your back.

902
00:34:53,475 --> 00:34:56,195
Jiashang can't see this photo.

903
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,440
Thank you

904
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:02,080
for being so sweet and thoughtful.

905
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,714
No need.

906
00:35:03,725 --> 00:35:05,844
Our two families are bonded.

907
00:35:05,975 --> 00:35:07,200
It's the least

908
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,481
we should do.

909
00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:12,239
I know you and Jiashang are friends,

910
00:35:12,399 --> 00:35:13,360
but you're

911
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,875
more intelligent than I thought.

912
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,851
I'm impressed.

913
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:19,879
Alright.

914
00:35:19,879 --> 00:35:20,825
What else?

915
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,000
Get it all out.

916
00:35:23,675 --> 00:35:25,314
I'm listening.

917
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:27,264
Fine. I'll be straight.

918
00:35:29,025 --> 00:35:30,520
To be honest,

919
00:35:31,175 --> 00:35:32,500
I still love Jiashang

920
00:35:32,725 --> 00:35:34,405
as much as I did before.

921
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,700
I was heartbroken

922
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:39,004
seeing him getting engaged

923
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,650
on his birthday.

924
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:42,959
When I

925
00:35:42,959 --> 00:35:44,925
found out about his fiancée's affair,

926
00:35:45,075 --> 00:35:47,714
I felt enraged and sorry for him.

927
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,841
In my eyes,

928
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,081
no one is better than him.

929
00:35:52,925 --> 00:35:54,375
If I were his wife,

930
00:35:55,175 --> 00:35:57,054
I'd spend the rest of my life

931
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,080
making him happy.

932
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,200
All I need

933
00:36:02,325 --> 00:36:03,925
is a chance.

934
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,000
It takes

935
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,719
a lot of courage

936
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,340
to pour your heart out like that.

937
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,399
I apologize

938
00:36:14,399 --> 00:36:16,639
if I cross the line.

939
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,460
So,

940
00:36:21,475 --> 00:36:22,756
why should I

941
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,479
help you?

942
00:36:29,975 --> 00:36:32,479
Du Lanxin is cheating on your son.

943
00:36:32,479 --> 00:36:34,900
You can cancel their engagement

944
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,941
without losing anything

945
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,960
once you show that photo to the Dus.

946
00:36:38,275 --> 00:36:39,350
After that,

947
00:36:39,525 --> 00:36:40,750
you can have me

948
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:41,909
as well as the Gold Kylin.

949
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,924
Mr. Rong, I understand you want

950
00:36:45,075 --> 00:36:46,356
that Gold Kylin and you want it now,

951
00:36:46,725 --> 00:36:47,919
but my father

952
00:36:47,919 --> 00:36:49,320
cherishes it.

953
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:51,870
If

954
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,600
Jiashang takes me back,

955
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,591
I promise that I'll hand it

956
00:36:57,775 --> 00:36:59,475
to you on a plate.

957
00:37:00,925 --> 00:37:03,365
And in terms of our business,

958
00:37:04,175 --> 00:37:06,275
we're only sharing with you

959
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,919
one shipping route in the north.

960
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,239
Taiji and I believe

961
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,040
we can deepen

962
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,350
our cooperation.

963
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,000
Mr. Rong,

964
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,309
trust me.

965
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:21,120
Only I can

966
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,825
merge our two families into one.

967
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:27,280
Taiji

968
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,159
is nothing but a hedonist.

969
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,879
Once he's in charge,

970
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,959
I'll have to manage everything for him.

971
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,199
If Jiashang and I get married,

972
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:37,560
what's mine

973
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,879
will also be yours,

974
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,479
am I right?

975
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,360
That way,

976
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,080
the Hashimotos' property will go to us.

977
00:37:45,399 --> 00:37:46,399
Is that what you want?

978
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,520
As Jiashang's wife,

979
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,490
I'm one of you, of course.

980
00:37:50,986 --> 00:37:52,625
Whatever the Rongs

981
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:53,800
and the Hashimotos have,

982
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,079
in the end,

983
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,250
they'll all belong to our children, no?

984
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,880
I'm not the shortsighted
and selfish type.

985
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,800
I can see the big picture.

986
00:38:11,399 --> 00:38:12,280
Very well.

987
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:15,150
This is

988
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,825
a complete surprise.

989
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:18,320
I'm glad

990
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,650
Jiashang has met you.

991
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,120
The problem is

992
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,000
how can you make sure

993
00:38:24,399 --> 00:38:26,639
Taiji will beat Taichi
to the succession?

994
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:29,275
I heard Taichi is getting much better.

995
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:33,280
He's living on borrowed time.

996
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:35,280
As you know,

997
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:37,159
he's too sick.

998
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,239
He can't go out very often,

999
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:40,399
or be exhausted

1000
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,150
or stressed.

1001
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,800
Any carelessness

1002
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,199
and he has a relapse outside,

1003
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,850
that can be fatal.

1004
00:38:59,475 --> 00:39:00,354
Have some tea.

1005
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,080
Miss Hashimoto,

1006
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,280
it's late.

1007
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,520
My driver will take you back.

1008
00:39:19,439 --> 00:39:21,250
Goodbye, Mr. Rong.

1009
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,490
I expect to hear from you soon.

1010
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,575
Wait.

1011
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,395
He's mine!

1012
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:17,100
Let's go.

1013
00:40:26,475 --> 00:40:27,154
Father.

1014
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,146
Mhm.

1015
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,050
All done?

1016
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,639
Yes.

1017
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:36,520
And the Fengs?

1018
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,120
They signed it, too.

1019
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:40,159
Without making a scene?

1020
00:40:40,725 --> 00:40:41,965
Feng Shixun did,

1021
00:40:42,775 --> 00:40:44,280
but Feng Shizhen put her name on it.

1022
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,175
There was nothing else he could do.

1023
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,250
I see.

1024
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,639
They aren't too stupid.

1025
00:40:51,975 --> 00:40:53,159
You did well.

1026
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:54,560
It's over now.

1027
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:57,280
Look at this.

1028
00:40:59,150 --> 00:40:59,900
What is it?

1029
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:02,840
Just now,

1030
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,075
Hashimoto Shiori came

1031
00:41:04,399 --> 00:41:05,840
with this photo.

1032
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,239
She said a lot

1033
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,479
but it was all about one thing.

1034
00:41:09,196 --> 00:41:11,075
Break off your engagement to Du Lanxin

1035
00:41:11,075 --> 00:41:12,075
and marry her.

1036
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,900
She'd give us

1037
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:16,560
the Hashimotos' property

1038
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,375
and the Gold Kylin.

1039
00:41:17,919 --> 00:41:21,080
And she wanted her elder brother dead.

1040
00:41:22,381 --> 00:41:23,500
I was shocked

1041
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,660
that a young girl like her

1042
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,075
was so wildly ambitious.

1043
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,375
Father,

1044
00:41:29,475 --> 00:41:30,636
what are you going to do?

1045
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,439
Are you going to help her?

1046
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,425
Taichi is Hashimoto Shozo's lawful heir.

1047
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,399
No way would I listen to her

1048
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,639
and get on the Hashimotos' bad side.

1049
00:41:43,425 --> 00:41:44,585
Given that

1050
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,750
she's a Japanese
and a concubine's daughter

1051
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,120
of humble birth but evil mind

1052
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,101
who'd murder her family

1053
00:41:53,775 --> 00:41:55,654
for her own gain,

1054
00:41:55,919 --> 00:41:56,950
she can be

1055
00:41:57,239 --> 00:41:58,719
a useful pawn,

1056
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,325
but never

1057
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,280
a family member.

1058
00:42:02,725 --> 00:42:03,950
In this case,

1059
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,159
let's cancel the engagement first.

1060
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,025
Du Lanxin is promiscuous

1061
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:13,209
and brings it on herself.

1062
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,734
We have every right

1063
00:42:14,925 --> 00:42:16,084
to get rid of her.

1064
00:42:16,925 --> 00:42:19,000
But that can wait.

1065
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:21,399
What's your plan?

1066
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,439
The Central China
Antique Charity Auction,

1067
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,760
held every five years,

1068
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,919
will open in the city museum next month.

1069
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:30,399
Our family is invited.

1070
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,239
Take Du Lanxin with you.

1071
00:42:32,959 --> 00:42:35,199
(Auction Invitation)
Bring the invitations to the Hashimotos.

1072
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,639
Miss Hashimoto

1073
00:42:36,879 --> 00:42:39,159
is going to need one.
