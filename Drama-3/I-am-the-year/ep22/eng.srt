William.

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,480
I'm here to save you.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Sorry, sorry.

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,560
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

26
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,240
Yes, I'm sorry.

27
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,520
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

28
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,360
Dear.

29
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,240
Come on.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,760
Oh, my God.

31
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,000
Are you aware of the current situation?

32
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,120
Y-You're embroidering?

33
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,840
Stabilize emotions

00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,920
and relieve stress through manual labor.

35
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,400
What do you think?

36
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,000
Look.

37
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,360
Does it look good?

38
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,680
Then tell me

39
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,920
how is the effect?

40
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,320
Before you came,

41
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,280
the effects were not obvious.

42
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,360
But after you came,

43
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,520
it has been a little bit better.

44
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,720
How do I put this?

45
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,920
Why did you

46
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,400
come here?

47
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,360
Big news.

48
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,000
We found the hospital in the photo.

49
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,960
Are you okay?

50
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,200
Help me get up.

51
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,720
Are you okay?

52
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,000
Get cracking.

53
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,720
Let's go now.

54
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,520
Let's go.

55
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:56,720
You two.

56
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,600
Buddy.

57
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,840
We're here to see the site

58
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,480
to set up a factory.

59
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,920
We're introduced by Mr. Hu.

60
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,080
Hu.

61
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,000
Oh, I see.

62
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,520
Mr. Hu from the factory over there, right?

63
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,000
Yes.

64
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,240
Yes, I know him.

65
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,560
What?

66
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,640
The hospital is going to be demolished?

67
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,040
We're here to check it out.

68
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,600
If it's okay, we'll expand it.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,440
Boss.

70
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,640
You go ahead and check it out.

71
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,440
Buddy.

72
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,720
You said just now

73
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,040
this was a hospital before.

74
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,520
Why does it seem desolate?

75
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:23,920
(Market Supervision Administration)

76
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,600
(Market Supervision Administration)
You're not aware.

77
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,440
Even though

78
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,160
the sign for the Market Supervision Administration
is up there,

79
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,800
20 years ago,

80
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,080
this was the famous Third Affiliated Hospital

81
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,320
of the Central Hospital.

82
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:32,920
Was it?

83
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,160
In those days,

84
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,320
all the patients

85
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,040
and specialists
from all over the country came here.

86
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,200
Unlike now.

87
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,800
Few people come.

88
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,600
Yes...

89
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,760
Are you okay?

90
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,720
What's wrong?

91
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,360
Your boss is young,

92
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,000
but he's pretty weak.

93
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,800
The two of you should leave.

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,760
Hurry up and go.

95
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,720
No, buddy.

96
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,280
What are you talking about?

97
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,000
I heard it from others

98
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,800
that weak people

99
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,880
are prone to get a disease

100
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,400
with red spots on their bodies here.

101
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,920
You'd better leave now.

102
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,440
Boss, let's leave.

103
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,680
How do you feel?

104
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,800
Can you help me get someone

105
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,520
to test the radiation levels in the hospital?

106
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,800
A radiation test?

107
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,720
That's a difficult task.

108
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,200
I wouldn't say much

109
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,280
if you said formaldehyde test.

110
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,920
Who would do a radiation test for no reason?

111
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,840
You're making things difficult for me.

112
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,040
If I'm right,

113
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,800
what I'm looking for

114
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,840
is in this hospital.

115
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,880
You mean

116
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,040
what you've been looking for

117
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,000
is in that hospital?

118
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,840
Where is the president of that hospital?

119
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,520
He died in his second year in prison.

120
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,160
His wife and children

121
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,320
went missing, too.

122
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,760
It is said that

123
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,000
a lot of patients

124
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,120
are still looking for them.

125
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,080
That old man said something about red spots.

126
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,720
Is it true?

127
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,600
When I saw this stone,

128
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,960
it was still in the Shenlong Snow Mountain.

129
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,920
I thought it was buried by an avalanche.

130
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,080
But not only was it not obliterated,

131
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,360
it somehow ended up in the city.

132
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,880
This stone is very radioactive.

133
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,640
Some of the minerals inside

134
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,040
probably haven't been developed and discovered.

135
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,360
So the so-called red spot disease

136
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,640
must be caused by the radiation and minerals.

137
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,740
(Jin Xiaoyu)

138
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:55,920
Hello, Xiaoyu.

139
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,960
Qian Tu and I are on our way back.

140
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,560
Now?

141
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,440
Yes, I see.

142
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,160
Xiaoyu asked me to meet her at the funeral home.

143
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,560
Isn't she on vacation today?

144
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,720
Even though the world is in chaos,

145
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,320
it wouldn't stop you from dating her.

146
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,560
Do you envy me?

147
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,880
Nope.

148
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,500
(General Service Hall)

149
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,480
(Qianqiu Hall)
Come with me.

150
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,760
I have something to show you two.

151
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,960
If you're about to propose,

152
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,000
I'll excuse myself.

153
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,720
This surprise is much
more exciting than a proposal.

154
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,160
Let's go.

155
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:39,800
Let's go.

156
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,480
Where did you get this photo?

157
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,840
I sent people to protect Professor Lin
for the past several days

158
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,120
and found someone stalking him.

159
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,240
The stalker was Zhao Shan.

160
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,760
My men chased him to his hideout

161
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,560
but couldn't catch them.

162
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,840
This photo

163
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,480
was found by Jiang Baiju in the house.

164
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,560
The flower seeds were given to me by Lin Nuoyan.

165
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,120
They bloomed several days ago.

166
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,040
Lin Nuoyan?

167
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,960
Xiaoyu and I will talk to Lin Nuouyan.

168
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,120
If you find out something new,

169
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,920
let me know.

170
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,240
Okay, no problem.

171
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,840
After I visit Qian Cheng tomorrow,

172
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,720
I'll arrange for someone
to find equipment that tests radioactivity.

173
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,360
Okay.

174
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,680
I have a feeling lately

175
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,480
that something bad is going to happen.

176
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,880
Too many things have happened recently.

177
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,800
Everyone's panicking.

178
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,440
It's okay.

179
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,920
The people from the underground pharmacy,

180
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,320
the Peng family and the Xue family
are all watching us.

181
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,080
You're always out there.

182
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,840
Protect yourself.

183
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,120
Be safe.

184
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,040
What are you doing?

185
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,560
I can't stand

186
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,000
the way you're looking at me
with such affectionate eyes.

187
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,240
Me?

188
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,600
With affection?

189
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,480
I'm jealous.

190
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,200
You really were.

191
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,320
I'm sorry.

192
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:57,800
See you later.

193
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,400
Bye-bye.

194
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,520
It's the first time in decades

195
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,560
that no one is home.

196
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,600
Wait a minute.

197
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,880
(Buwenzhong)

198
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,520
I hear music.

199
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,720
Why are you here?

200
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,360
I've lived here for 20 years.

201
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,080
This is my home.

202
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,080
Oh.

203
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,680
Hello, young lady.

204
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,080
I was in a hurry the last time

205
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,880
and forgot to introduce myself.

206
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,600
My name is Dao Lan,

207
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,600
William's second uncle.

208
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,800
I'm also the young master's favorite guardian.

209
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,640
Hold it.

210
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,120
I only said you were my favorite child.

211
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,160
I didn't say you were my favorite guardian.

212
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,240
Correction.

213
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,800
I am the young master's favorite

214
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,280
child.

215
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,840
That was also when you were five years old.

216
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,760
You were cute back then.

217
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,320
Anyway, I'm his favorite.

218
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,080
Nice to meet you.

219
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,280
You're here so late.

220
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,040
What can I do for you?

221
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,480
William ran away.

222
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,800
He ran away?

223
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,360
Remember what I said?

224
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,640
This is

225
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,200
his talent.

226
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,960
You can see him from a mile away

227
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,640
with two bodyguards at his side.

228
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,720
And you let him get away?

229
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,440
I'm really impressed.

230
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,000
He got away

231
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,360
with the help of a lady named Cheng Weilan.

232
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,360
She seems to be a friend of yours.

233
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:45,800
I wonder

234
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,240
if William was a bad influence

235
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,840
or was Cheng Weilan a bad influence.

236
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,080
They both are.

237
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,680
It's possible.

238
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,320
I looked up

239
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,600
William's credit card records.

240
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,440
He bought a plane ticket

241
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,000
to

242
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,080
the United States.

243
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,760
- The United States?
- The United States?

244
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,020
(Buwenzhong)

245
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,600
Are you nervous?

246
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,680
Is it that obvious?

247
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,280
You have no expression on your face.

248
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,920
But your hands are shaking.

249
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,360
I'm sorry.

250
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,360
I'd better stay by myself.

251
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,120
It's midnight. Where are you going?

252
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,680
What do you think Lin Nuoyan knows?

253
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,320
About that Zhao Shan,

254
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,920
and those strange flowers.

255
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,080
The flowers

256
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,880
were brought by Lin Nuoyan
from the experimental field.

257
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,360
The person in charge of the experimental field

258
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,200
is President Zhang
of the Central Medical University.

259
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:48,960
How did you know that?

260
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,800
Because I texted him

261
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,880
when I came back.

262
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,080
That's nice.

263
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,040
I also asked him where the flowers were planted.

264
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,960
He also told me that.

265
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,240
And I made an appointment with him

266
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,240
to go to the test field tomorrow afternoon.

267
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,200
We'll go see it together.

268
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,160
Really?

269
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,360
That's very kind of you.

270
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,360
I've been wanting to mention this to you before.

271
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,960
But I...

272
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,840
I couldn't say it.

273
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,880
I know.

274
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,680
Because Lin Nuoyan always said he likes me.

275
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,880
You can't beg him.

276
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,480
It's not convenient for you to ask him yourself.

277
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,440
So I have to do it myself

278
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,360
to help you solve your problems.

279
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,320
You thought your boyfriend

280
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,800
was a mature man
who could take care of his own problems,

281
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,240
but he turned out to be a troublemaker.

282
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:25,960
Are you upset?

283
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,520
A little.

284
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,920
What?

285
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,160
Do you despise me?

286
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,400
Well.

287
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,000
Don't all girls want a dominant boyfriend

288
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,160
and to be pampered without putting in any effort?

289
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,560
But after meeting someone you like,

290
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,360
all your fantasies and principles

291
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,760
will be shattered.

292
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,600
And in our generation,

293
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,080
it's all about having chill relationships.

294
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,280
But after I met you, I realized

295
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,280
that dating is really troublesome.

296
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,200
I don't care.

297
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,360
I just want to bother you a little more.

298
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,520
A little more.

299
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,520
One more time.

300
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,400
Stop it.

301
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,400
I'm serious.

302
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,920
In the past,

303
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,080
I never thought about your future.

304
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,840
I had no idea.

305
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,520
But today,

306
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:15,880
I have made up my mind.

307
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,400
If Lin Nuoyan really found that meteorite

308
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,040
that can restore you to an ordinary person,

309
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,240
I hope that after my death

310
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,920
you can spend your life like an ordinary person.

311
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,000
Then have a natural death.

312
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,440
But even if I become an ordinary person,

313
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,040
I won't be able to meet another you.

314
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,920
Life doesn't have to be about falling in love.

315
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,120
If you meet someone you like, you date them.

316
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,920
If you don't, you stay alone.

317
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,720
Okay.

318
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,280
I'll spend the time you couldn't have

319
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,320
seriously.

320
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,160
While I'm alive,

321
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,120
we'll be there for each other.

322
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,880
We'll take care of each other.

323
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,320
But if I'm not here anymore,

324
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,960
you must promise me

325
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,200
to do what you like.

326
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,040
But I like you.

327
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,080
I like you, too.

328
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,400
Why did you say it first?

329
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,640
In the past, you said all other things first.

330
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,920
You were the one who initiated the kiss.

331
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,080
Let me say it first today.

332
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,280
Okay?

333
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,160
I love you.

334
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,360
Very much.

335
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,600
Really.

336
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,360
I was going to say

337
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,560
I'm gonna marry you.

338
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,960
I won again.

339
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,840
Yeah!

340
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,560
Wait a minute.

341
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,760
I... I...

342
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,200
Didn't I propose to you before?

343
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,160
I didn't say yes

344
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,000
that time.

345
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,720
So it doesn't count.

346
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,760
Then you think I'll...

347
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,520
Of course I can't say no.

348
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,640
Why are you so nice?

349
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,400
You know me so well now.

350
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:41,880
Really.

351
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,720
I'm so happy.

352
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,080
I'm not so nervous anymore.

What is this place?

369
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,160
Don't cry.

370
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,880
Qian Cheng will be sad

371
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,280
if he sees you crying.

372
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,040
Okay, I won't cry.

373
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,160
Qian Cheng.

374
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,320
I'm sorry.

375
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,400
Cheng, are you feeling better?

376
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,440
I'm fine.

377
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,240
If you guys don't have anything to say...

378
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,320
I'd like to say something.

379
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,080
Mom and Dad are coming to see you later.

380
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,040
Okay.

381
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,760
I went to negotiate with the Peng family

382
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,880
and got a lawyer.

383
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,160
We'll get you out of jail as soon as possible.

384
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,360
Okay.

385
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,840
I remember you have told me

386
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,480
he doesn't like crowded places.

387
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,560
So

388
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,000
I made time to personally check the wiring

389
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,560
after work today.

390
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,440
Thank you

391
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,160
for doing overtime for us.

392
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,200
I did it for you.

393
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:08,920
Not you.

394
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,280
Thank you.

395
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,560
You're welcome.

396
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:14,960
Here.

397
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,240
You can grow the flowers.

398
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,640
Then why did you let me plant it?

399
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,280
Just in case

400
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,120
you can't grow it,

401
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,920
I at least have this one

402
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,960
to confess my love.

403
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,480
You're really good at this.

404
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,680
It's a pity.

405
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,160
I have the flowers

406
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,480
but no girlfriend.

407
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,800
Since she's your girlfriend,

408
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,800
you can have

409
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,880
the flowers, too.

410
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,960
Thank you, Professor Lin.

411
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,480
The flowers and the girl are both mine.

412
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,080
Lin Nuoyan.

413
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,000
Where did you get the flowers?

414
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,200
As far as I know,

415
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,280
this type of flower needs special cultivation.

416
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,040
Are you asking about

417
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,320
my lab?

418
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,520
My lab is a private investment.

419
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,600
The owner behind it

420
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,480
is a biotechnology company called

421
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,360
Eternal Life Technology.

422
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,840
It's an American company,

423
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,360
specializing in the production of medicinal herbs.

424
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,840
Yes, medicines and medical devices.

425
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,640
They produce these kinds of things.

426
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,080
A few years ago,

427
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,920
the company worked on a research project
of tissue regeneration

428
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,280
with the Central University here

429
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,360
and established a special laboratory.

430
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,720
I was assigned to be the director.

431
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,480
But due to the secrecy of the project,

432
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,200
even the director

433
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,080
couldn't know all the contents of the project.

434
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,960
The flower is from another project.

435
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,320
I only know that at the moment

436
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,400
President Zhang is in charge of the project.

437
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,960
He has a large field of experimental flowers.

438
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,640
Do you know where it is?

439
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:45,880
Well.

440
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,560
It's confidential.

441
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,000
Don't feel bad.

442
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,060
(Mu City Health Care Hospital)

443
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,960
Who are you?

444
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,520
Hello, Mr. Qian Tu.

445
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,680
We are the Ye family's bodyguards.

446
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,400
They are my father's personal bodyguards.

447
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,560
What?

448
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,800
I didn't kidnap Ye Lai.

449
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,640
What is the meaning of this?

450
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,920
Sorry, Mr. Qian Tu.

451
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,600
We're here to pick up the lady.

452
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,920
Sorry, Qian Tu.

453
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,520
I didn't tell my family I was going out today.

454
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
I'm sorry I made you look bad.

455
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:26,920
It's okay.

456
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,240
Safety first.

457
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,640
Miss, let's go.

458
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,400
Tell me when you get home.

459
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,240
Okay.

460
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,640
Looks like

461
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,280
your boss wants you to bring me a message.

462
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,760
Our boss said

463
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,200
they don't want the young lady
and Mr. Qian Cheng to be together.

464
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,120
He said

465
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,880
the Ye and Qian families are family friends.

466
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,440
Don't let some puppy love

467
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,400
sabotage the peace and harmony
between the two families.

468
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,760
First of all,

469
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,640
my brother is not a child.

470
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,160
Secondly,

471
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,640
I think it's not puppy love

472
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,840
between him and Ye Lai.

473
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,920
I hope you heard what I said.

474
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,400
If that's your reply,

475
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,320
then I think it will really hurt the friendship
between the two families.

476
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,320
I advise you to think twice.

477
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,040
I'll pretend

478
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,280
I didn't hear it.

479
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,280
Who is this?

480
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,800
Why do the flowers in this photo

481
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,640
look like President Zhang's?

482
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,480
It's similar.

483
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,640
Where did you get this photo?

484
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,640
The photo is of a wanted criminal.

485
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,800
But 20 years ago,

486
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,640
he was a doctor.

487
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,280
He has been hiding since then

488
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,240
because of an illegal medical incident.

489
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,000
The reason why those flowers
on the photo grow abnormally

490
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,360
is because their seeds

491
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,000
were exposed to mutagenic radiation
for a long time.

492
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,200
And the source of the radiation is a meteorite.

493
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,200
The fugitive

494
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,400
has been using this meteorite to make medicine

495
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,480
and experimenting on innocent patients.

496
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,200
So you're saying

497
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,560
they're the ones experimenting on

498
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,320
Bella and other patients.

499
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:11,880
That's right.

500
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,680
That's why we've been looking for this group.

501
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,880
If the flowers belong to President Zhang,

502
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,360
then the meteorite must be with him.

503
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,640
That means President Zhang is...

504
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,040
Wait a minute.

505
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,520
Xiaoyu, what do you mean?

506
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,520
Do you suspect

507
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,320
President Zhang?

508
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,960
It can't be President Zhang.

509
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:29,760
It's him.

510
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,880
It can't be President Zhang!

511
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,360
Do you know who President Zhang is?

512
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,520
He's a scholar!

513
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,440
He's a medical scientist!

514
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,680
He has a scientific spirit!

515
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,560
Lin Nuoyan, calm down!

516
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,680
I don't need to calm down, Xiaoyu!

517
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,080
He was my college teacher!

518
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,600
I know him better than any of you!

519
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,080
He...

520
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,040
He couldn't have harmed anyone.

521
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,640
You must have made a mistake!

522
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,480
- It must be...
- Lin Nuoyan.

523
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,200
The reason you panicked

524
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,840
is because you already have the answer.

525
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,040
You don't need to convince us.

526
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,560
You should ask yourself.

527
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,800
Bella's life

528
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,880
or your teacher's reputation,

529
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,080
which is more important?

530
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,440
Wait a minute.

531
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,040
I think I've seen

532
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,600
the person in this photo somewhere before.

533
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,760
Where?

534
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,080
In President Zhang's office.

535
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,600
It's in that room.

536
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,040
Xiaoyu.

537
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,120
You stand guard at the door.

538
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,200
We'll go in and check.

539
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,560
If there is a security patrol,

540
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,160
call us.

541
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,560
Okay.

542
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,240
Let's go.

543
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,200
The test field is located

544
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,680
at the Eternal Life Technology Building
behind the school.

545
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,720
President Zhang should be
doing his rounds there now.

546
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,640
Let's look for the man's photo first.

547
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,200
Okay.

548
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:30,960
Jiang Baiju.

549
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,160
Jiang Baiju!

550
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,840
Is it this guy?

551
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:39,840
That's him.

552
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,800
On the bookshelf are some awards

553
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,560
and photos of doctoral students in recent years.

554
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,400
Those on the old photos here should be

555
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,440
the former undergraduates.

556
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
If that's the case,

557
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,320
Zhao Shan is really President Zhang's student

558
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,640
twenty years ago.

559
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:56,960
Thank you.

560
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,360
Professor Lin.

561
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:00,840
What?

562
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:02,600
All right.

563
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,560
Let's clean up the place.

564
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,560
Let's go out and find Xiaoyu.

565
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,200
Okay.

566
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:06,880
Let's go.

567
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,480
Let's go.

568
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:16,180
(Eternal Life Technology)

569
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,760
At this hour, President Zhang

570
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,200
must be doing his rounds here.

571
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,440
Let's look for him first.

572
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:22,680
Let's go.

573
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,880
Help!

574
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,000
Someone is calling for help.

575
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,120
President Zhang.

576
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,440
It's President Zhang!

577
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,000
Help!

578
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,040
Help!

579
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,120
Help!

580
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,200
President Zhang!

581
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,400
President Zhang!

582
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,640
Xiaoyu.

583
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,520
Xiaoyu.

584
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,200
You're bleeding!

585
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,720
I'm fine.

586
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,000
Be careful!

587
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,160
Jiang Baiju.

588
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,640
Jiang Baiju.

589
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,040
Jiang Baiju.

590
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,520
Where did you get the meteorite?

591
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,200
It's you.

592
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,160
You're the undead person.

593
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,800
If you want to save yourself from suffering,

594
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,200
then tell me what you know.

595
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,200
Haven't you been investigating us all along

596
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,520
from the hospital before?

597
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,120
You should know a lot.

598
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,960
If you don't want to suffer too much,

599
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,360
then tell us what you know.

600
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,000
All right, let's not force a confession now.

601
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,960
Xiaoyu, call an ambulance.

602
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,760
No need to call an ambulance.

603
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,160
Take President Zhang to the hospital.

604
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,160
President Zhang is fine.

605
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,720
Mr. Jiang was stabbed in the spleen.

606
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,960
If he doesn't get medical attention,

607
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,080
he'll die.

608
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,080
He is an exception.

609
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,000
You're really in cahoots with President Zhang?

610
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,960
He doesn't know much.

611
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,240
Then why did you try to kill him?

612
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,280
He got suspicious.

613
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,680
He wouldn't help me anymore.

614
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,200
He wanted to call the police on me.

615
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,280
Do you know where the thing I'm looking for is?

616
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,480
You mean the rock?

617
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,080
Yeah.

618
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,920
It's on the same floor as the flower bed.

619
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,320
But there's a containment device.

620
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,760
You have to wear a protective suit to get in.

621
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,480
Don't tell anyone

622
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,840
what happened today.

623
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:35,960
When President Zhang wakes up,

624
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,920
we'll discuss it with him.

625
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,560
Keep an eye on him.

626
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,720
Don't let him get away.

627
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,920
Okay, Professor Lin.

628
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:42,760
Let's go.

629
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,960
Let's be quick.

630
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,620
(Zhang Kewen  President)

631
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,280
This is what you're looking for, right?

632
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,000
Originally it was bigger.

633
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,000
Originally...

634
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,240
You've seen it before?

635
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,440
Eighty years ago.

636
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,760
On the snow mountain in southern Yunnan.

637
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,880
What are you doing?

638
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,320
I want to return something to it.

639
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,840
Who on earth are you?

640
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,800
Like Zhao Shan said,

641
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,720
an undead.

642
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,840
Eighty years ago,

643
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,400
I received something unknown

644
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,840
from this meteorite.

645
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,240
The unknown substance

646
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,480
lodged itself in my body.

647
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,160
It made me immortal and unable to be harmed.

648
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,040
Now that I'm in front of it.

649
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,600
I have to return the substance to it.

650
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,880
I'll also

651
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,800
see what this unknown substance is.

652
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,320
Are you saying

653
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,760
you're giving up your immortality?

654
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,560
I'm not going to lie to you.

655
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,000
I've lived for a hundred years.

656
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,640
In these hundred years,

657
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,000
I've grown tired of it.

658
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,400
I guess it's tired of it, too.

659
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,720
Before I came across the meteorite,

660
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,600
I didn't know what it is,

661
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,360
nor did I know how to suppress it.

662
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,080
But when I touched the glass just now,

663
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,720
I felt like it was going to jump out of my heart.

664
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,160
It probably wants to go back, too.

665
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,960
Can you open

666
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,760
this device?

667
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,640
This is the latest radiation protection device.

668
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,280
Once it's open,

669
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,960
the whole building will be alerted

670
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,440
in 10 seconds.

671
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,040
And then the police will come

672
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,040
and take the meteorite away.

673
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,480
If you want to see it again,

674
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,040
I'm afraid it won't be that easy.

675
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,080
But ten seconds

676
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,920
is enough for you to touch it.

677
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,480
But I need to remind you,

678
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,120
all things in this world

679
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,800
abide the laws of nature.

680
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,680
If it is like what you say,

681
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,560
then you've violated this law

682
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,800
because of what you have in your body.

683
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,640
When it is returned,

684
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,400
you might...

685
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,040
you might...

686
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,000
die

687
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:41,920
or something unexpected

688
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,080
may happen to you.

689
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,360
These are all possible.

690
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,160
You have to mentally prepare yourself.

691
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,800
The switch is right here.

692
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,920
Make your own decision.

693
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,320
I'll give you guys a few minutes.

694
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,800
I'll wait outside.

695
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,680
And by the way,

696
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,680
you can't take off your protective suit here.

697
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,640
So,

698
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:12,760
you guys be careful.

699
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,760
All this time I thought

700
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,120
you would be the first to go.

701
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,760
I guess

702
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,920
I'll be leaving first.

703
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,880
He said it's a possibility.

704
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,600
It's not confirmed.

705
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,040
So

706
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,280
maybe I'll still be the one to pass away first.

707
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,400
Don't lie to yourself.

708
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,080
He's right.

709
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,880
We are part of nature.

710
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,840
I defied the laws of nature

711
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,680
and have lived so long.

712
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,480
There's a price to pay.

713
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,280
Right?

714
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,840
But the best result would be

715
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,800
I turn into a hundred-year-old man.

716
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,560
Right?

717
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,240
And then I'll be dying.

718
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,920
Then we can go together.

719
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:07,880
And die together.

720
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,400
Jiang Baiju.

721
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,040
Let me tell you.

722
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,120
Actually I have already thought about the words

723
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,920
to comfort you.

724
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,920
Such as rest in peace.

725
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,400
Wait for me over there.

726
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,000
I will definitely come to you.

727
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,160
Also, when you are alive,

728
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,840
I will love you and think of you,

729
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,800
not to upset you.

730
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,440
I'm pretty good with words.

731
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,640
But I guess I won't be using these words.

732
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,680
You're not good with words.

733
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,040
Let me tell you.

734
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,880
When I was in school,

735
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,320
I was first in my class in elegy writing.

736
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,400
Jiang Baiju.

737
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,960
My life expectancy is short.

738
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,280
After I met you,

739
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,520
it feels even shorter.

740
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,240
It's like a dream

741
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,600
when I am with you.

742
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,400
Even though I'm waking up from the dream.

743
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,360
I'm not sad at all.

744
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,400
Do you know why?

745
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,760
Because you have fulfilled all my dreams.

746
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,080
You're handsome, rich,

747
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,880
long-legged and old.

748
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,360
The most important thing is

749
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,760
you've lived a long life.

750
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,400
Where can I find such a good boyfriend?

751
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,480
Don't worry.

752
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,440
If you die,

753
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,040
I will go with you right away.

754
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,360
Don't be afraid.

755
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,840
Then
