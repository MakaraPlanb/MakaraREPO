=Episode 21=

19
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,360
I got you some beef noodles.

20
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,840
I'm starving.

21
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,320
Here you go.

22
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,720
There's so little beef here.

23
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,040
Look how round your face is.

24
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,200
Eat less, girl.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,760
Your pinch stretched my face, okay?

26
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,200
Stingy.

27
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,120
I work so hard but all I get
is a bowl of vegetable noodles.

28
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,280
I'm here.

29
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,320
The noodles smell so good.

30
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,000
Are you having beef noodles for today?

31
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,600
Xue Wanwan?

32
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,400
What are you doing here?

33
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,480
You didn't see me, huh?

34
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,720
I don't see you.

35
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,720
All I see is her.

36
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,960
Other people do not exist.

37
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,200
Dao Ruifeng, are you sick of living?

38
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:23,880
What?

39
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,000
I suggest you to be nice.

40
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
Your brother has announced

41
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,040
that he'll once again be my investor.

42
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,920
You don't know?

43
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,920
Her brother was your investor before?

44
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,680
He's so nice to you.

45
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,240
Her brother treats me very nicely.

46
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,360
Right? Xue Wanwan.

47
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,800
My first bucket of gold

48
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,160
was all thanks to her brother.

49
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,120
I experienced the fun of making money.

50
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,240
Right, Xue Wanwan?

51
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,360
It looks like there's an inside story.

52
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,360
There's nothing between us.

53
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,760
In freshman year, my brother hit him.

54
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,160
He suffered a mild concussion.
So he compensated him more than 500,000 yuan.

55
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,280
500,000? So much?

56
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,840
500,000 isn't much at all.

57
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,040
My grandmother gave me all the money.

58
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,520
I spent a little bit of money

59
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,000
on a crappy computer to write web novels.

60
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,160
As for the rest of the 400,000 yuan,

61
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,320
I spent it on fake view numbers.

62
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,240
And somehow,

63
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,440
I became a Top-10 writer.

64
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,120
Don't worry,

65
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,280
the orthopedics department
of our hospital is first-class,

66
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,480
I'll help you call them later.

67
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:13,760
Seriously?

68
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,160
I guarantee that during your stay here,

69
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,720
you'll be able to write in peace.

70
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,440
Thank you, Doctor Cheng.

71
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,520
All I want is to be with you.

72
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,720
I'm very thoughtful.

73
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,680
If you become disabled,

74
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,360
I'll offer myself to you
to offset my brother's sin.

75
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,600
It's best that you sit in a wheelchair

76
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,720
so that you don't go around flirting with girls.

77
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,120
I'll get the best wheelchair for you.

78
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,800
Let me go.

79
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,600
Qian Cheng said he'd buy me an electric chair.

80
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,800
I can buy one, too.

81
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,320
Speaking of Qian Cheng,

82
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,080
how is he doing lately?

83
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,800
He's doing well.

84
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,840
He had a dream in the office.

85
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:40,960
Having a dream?

86
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,920
He is starting to have dreams?

87
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,840
You need to contact his doctor right away.

88
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,360
He needs psychological counseling.

89
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,480
Once a patient starts to have dreams,

90
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,840
their emotions may get unstable.

91
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,120
They'll have a mental breakdown.

92
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,040
Listen to me.

93
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,360
No counseling is needed.

94
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,600
I've been doing this for ten years

95
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,320
and it has been futile.

96
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,360
I tell you what,

97
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,840
during a therapy,

98
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,280
the most important thing

99
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,600
is the patient's own words.

100
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,960
If he can't express himself well

101
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,160
or he's hiding something,

102
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,640
the therapy shall stagnate.

103
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,560
Stagnate?

104
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,160
Dao Ruifeng!

105
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,200
Let him stagnate, then.

106
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,280
Dao Ruifeng, you're unbelievable.

107
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,880
Can you stop avoiding the topic?

108
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,840
I tell you what,

109
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,320
if you treat him as your best friend,

110
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,520
you should help him get better.

111
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,040
Do not try to hide his problems, okay?

112
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,480
If this continues,

113
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,960
he'll only become sicker.

114
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,080
Okay.

115
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,400
Stop eating.

116
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,400
Eat mine.

117
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,680
I don't want yours.

118
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,560
I only want hers.

119
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,720
Eat it!

120
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,320
No.

121
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,080
Sorry.

122
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,280
Sorry to keep you waiting.

123
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,040
It's fine.

124
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,480
I came to ask you a question.

125
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,480
I heard there was a problem with Bella's body?

126
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,920
Drive me to Qing'ai Building.

127
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,800
I'll give you the details in the car.

128
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,480
Let's go.

129
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,240
You mean

130
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,640
there was only a little cyanosis

131
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
on Bella's body,

132
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,200
and there was no sign of hair lost?

133
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,960
Any thoughts?

134
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,200
There isn't much time for the police.

135
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,840
In terms of the research of a medication,

136
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,440
the potency and side effects
are the two important indicators.

137
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,920
If the side effect is

138
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,960
so small on Bella,

139
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,080
it means the research of the medication

140
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,280
is about to succeed.

141
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,920
Succeed?

142
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,600
Why did Mrs. Xu and Bella both die?

143
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,000
They should've been cured, right?

144
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,960
It isn't an elixir.

145
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,040
One bite won't cure you.

146
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,240
Putting aside the fact that leukemia, cancer,

147
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,120
and other incurable diseases

148
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,560
need adjuvant treatment,

149
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,440
as far as we know,

150
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,720
all the pill-takers

151
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,440
came by it accidentally.

152
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,160
Only part of the effect is reached,

153
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,400
so I think there must be a long-term pill-taker

154
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,760
around the pill-maker.

155
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,320
Unlike the experimental subjects

156
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,280
like Mrs. Xu and Bella,

157
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,960
the person is a real participant of the project.

158
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,480
And this person

159
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,720
may have been cured.

160
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,880
You're right.

161
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,880
No accurate information could be gained

162
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,960
from these non-consistent drug tests outside.

163
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,600
Xiaoyu,

164
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,040
do you see the car behind us?

165
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,000
What?

166
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,520
I think it's been following us

167
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,720
since we left the funeral home.

168
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,200
Really? What do we do?

169
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,160
Sit tight.

170
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,480
I'll try another way.

171
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,280
It doesn't feel right, Xiaoyu.

172
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:51,960
Call the police.

173
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,520
Okay.

174
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,720
No, it'd be too late.

175
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,240
Look, Xiaoyu.

176
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,600
I'll find a chance to slow down,

177
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,480
and you jump off the car.

178
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,480
No, let's jump together!

179
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,440
Don't be absurd, Xiaoyu.

180
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,480
There's nothing out there.

181
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,760
Where do we hide after we jump?

182
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,760
You get off first.

183
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,360
No.

184
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,360
Let's jump together.

185
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,040
Quickly!

186
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,880
Lin Nuoyan!

187
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,320
Xiaoyu,

188
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,120
I'll be fine.

189
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,680
There's a crossroads ahead.

190
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,720
Jump after I count down from 3.

191
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:28,840
You hear me?

192
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,240
Get ready.

193
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,240
Three.

194
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,200
Two.

195
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:35,760
One!

196
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,320
Jump!

197
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,640
Hello?

198
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,640
We were going downtown
from the municipal funeral home.

199
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,960
A car just hit us.

200
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,760
Come help us.

201
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,840
Lin Nuoyan!

202
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:22,620
(Emergency Room)

203
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,780
Xiaoyu.

204
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,760
- Weilan!
- Are you okay?

205
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,080
How's Professor Lin?

206
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,600
I don't know.

207
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,760
He was just sent to the emergency room.

208
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,240
It might be the person who hit Officer Su.

209
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,880
He chased after us in a car.

210
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:40,960
It's okay.

211
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,040
- It's okay.
- It's alright now.

212
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,960
Lin Nuoyan will be fine.

213
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,640
Lin Nuoyan.

214
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,800
Thank you for saving my girlfriend.

215
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,600
- Thank you.
- What are you doing?

216
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,600
Thank you for saving my girlfriend.

217
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,080
I'm so grateful for you.

218
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,320
Don't think too much.

219
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,120
I only wanted to save her.

220
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,560
Xiaoyu,

221
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,960
your hand is injured.

222
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,160
- He has a mild concussion.
- Your hand.

223
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,040
His arm is dislocated

224
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,200
and his ankle is sprained.

225
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,800
The rest are just scratches.

226
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,640
He needs to stay the night for observation.

227
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,640
Who is his family?

228
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,240
Allow me.

229
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,440
I'll cover all of his medical costs.

230
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,400
I'm okay.

231
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,320
I just feel a bit...

232
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,520
I'm a bit dizzy.

233
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,360
I'm a bit dizzy.

234
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm glad that you're okay.

235
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,320
Does it still hurt?

236
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,080
So?

237
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,160
Are your girlfriend

238
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,240
and her boyfriend okay?

239
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,040
According to typical storylines,

240
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,920
shouldn't the supporting role
who has unrequited love

241
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,240
for the heroine sacrifice himself?

242
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,040
The writer for our show

243
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,400
is not professional enough.

244
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,120
You're really something else.

245
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,760
He saved your girlfriend,

246
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,680
and this is how you see him?

247
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,640
It's good that he isn't dead.

248
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,760
Otherwise, there would be another innocent victim.

249
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,280
But still, I need to thank you

250
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,920
for making me travel all the way here

251
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,960
to watch a good show.

252
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,880
I didn't ask you to come here to watch a show.

253
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,200
Do my favor.

254
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,520
The perpetrator failed at the first attempt,

255
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
so he'll definitely try again.

256
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,200
Even if he doesn't,

257
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,480
he'll be watching our moves.

258
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,360
Help me get two men

259
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,520
to protect Lin Nuoyan in secret

260
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,760
and to see if anyone's following him.

261
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,240
Okay.

262
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,920
Get two men

263
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,480
to see if there's anyone suspicious

264
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,040
around Professor Lin.

265
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,160
I think

266
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
the murderer can't

267
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,120
wait to show himself.

268
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,800
Why did you ask me to go kart racing with you?

269
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,400
It crossed my mind so I called you.

270
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,520
That's it?

271
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,240
That's it.

272
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,960
See what I'd like to see.

273
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,520
Do what I'd like to do.

274
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,600
Simple as that.

275
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,480
If I don't do it now,

276
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,520
no one knows

277
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,320
what will happen in the next second.

278
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,440
No one knows

279
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,040
how long will we be separated.

280
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,040
You're a bit different from before.

281
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,280
What was I like before?

282
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,800
You would ask boys to help you open bottles.

283
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,520
Was I that spoiled?

284
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:45,880
(City Tournament)
No.

285
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,800
You were like a goddess.

286
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,800
Every time we had a match,

287
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,280
when watching you cheering for us,

288
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,520
I'd really want to get you a bottle of water.

289
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,200
But William was too nasty.

290
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,640
If he had known that I liked you,

291
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,120
he would have pursued you.

292
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,640
That's why I didn't express my feelings.

293
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,320
William knew you liked me a long time ago.

294
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,760
Everybody knew.

295
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,640
I knew, too.

296
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,680
You were the only one

297
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,240
who didn't know that everybody knew.

298
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,120
Who told everyone else?

299
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,760
Duh!

300
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,520
You basically wrote "I like Ye Lai"

301
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,040
on your face.

302
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,040
Many told me

303
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,560
that Qian Cheng,
the captain of the basket team, liked me.

304
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,200
So I waited for you to approach me.

305
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,040
(Welcome to race club)
I waited and waited,

306
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,040
but you never did.

307
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,560
So I started to doubt myself.

308
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,320
Was I feeling too good about myself

309
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,680
or were they blind?

310
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,720
I would have confessed to you if I had known.

311
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,360
I'll go home and beat the hell out of William.

312
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,600
If William had been cheeky,

313
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,920
he would have pursued me a long time ago.

314
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,240
He did this because he wanted to prod you

315
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,600
into making a decision.

316
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,920
It's so good to be an adult.

317
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,400
I can get things

318
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,880
off my chest without any worries.

319
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,040
Sorry.

320
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,280
I was being a coward.

321
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,920
Are you still a coward now?

322
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,720
I-It's too sudden.

323
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,840
I can't even react.

324
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,960
At the banquet,

325
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,920
you were quite brave.

326
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,400
I was too emotional.

327
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,040
I had ten years of therapy in the US,

328
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,240
I can accept all the miseries that happened to me.

329
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,840
Over the past decade,

330
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,560
whenever I felt confused or unbearable,

331
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,240
what you said would cross my mind.

332
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:31,840
Qian Cheng,

333
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,440
I'm going abroad.

334
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,360
I may never come back again.

335
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,760
You must strive to live.

336
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,320
What are you talking about?

337
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,560
You're the one who should strive.

338
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,280
You know what I mean.

339
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,880
In life,

340
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,840
sorrow, pain, and sadness

341
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,600
are all trivial.

342
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,280
You must stay alive.

343
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,120
I have done it,

344
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,680
and I'm striving to live.

345
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,760
What about you?

346
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:08,920
I'm fine.

347
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,280
I'm healthy.

348
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,320
Everything

349
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:13,880
is fine.

350
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,320
You

351
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,240
told the therapist about

352
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,560
what happened to me?

353
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,600
No.

354
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,160
I never told

355
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,040
anyone about it.

356
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,880
I didn't even

357
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,040
tell William.

358
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,240
Thank you.

359
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,520
At that time, you saved my life

360
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,360
and my reputation.

361
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,120
I won't stay long

362
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,080
this time.

363
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,080
I just wanted to ask you

364
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,320
if you're willing to go to the US with me.

365
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,120
I'm seeing a therapist, too.

366
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,080
I know

367
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,200
it's bad for you

368
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,960
to keep my matters a secret.

369
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,040
You kept my secret.

370
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,720
You're trading your health

371
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,120
for my new life.

372
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,320
Though we can't be together,

373
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,120
I genuinely want the best for you.

374
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,200
Go to the US with me

375
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,240
to see my therapist.

376
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,920
He's really good.

377
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,800
You can share everything with him.

378
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,560
To leave this place...

379
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,160
The moment I got my proof of health,

380
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,240
I came back to see you.

381
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,520
Please think about

382
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,760
my proposal.

383
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,000
Cheng,

384
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,520
help me perform extraction separation

385
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,800
on Bella's hair.

386
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:48,880
Okay.

387
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,560
Young Master,

388
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,040
I'll help you.

389
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,360
What's the matter with Cheng?

390
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,880
He's like a mediating monk.

391
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,400
How can a monk meditate for a girl?

392
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,440
If Jin Xiaoyu sees him like this,

393
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,640
God knows what she'll say.

394
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,800
No one in love

395
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,880
would care about it.

396
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,120
Young Master,

397
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,640
you speak from experience.

398
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,760
It's been ten years.

399
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,400
Cheng never had puberty.

400
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,800
He never had a relationship.

401
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,280
It's the first time I see him like this.

402
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,480
This is quite new.

403
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,360
You know what Cheng Weilan said?

404
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,680
She asked me to take him to a therapist.

405
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,960
This is necessary.

406
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:21,720
Is it?

407
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,400
Qian Tu.

408
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,560
Hello?

409
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,200
Tu.

410
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,560
You got something already?

411
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,280
I found Zhao Shan.

412
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,200
You found him?

413
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,800
Okay.

414
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,440
Your brother is here.

415
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,200
I need to see Qian Tu.

416
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,880
Look after him.

417
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:47,960
You got it, Young Master.

418
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,600
Cheng.

419
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:58,960
So?

420
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,680
I've sent my men there.

421
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,960
I hope they'd get him.

422
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,160
Are you sure it's Zhao Shan?

423
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,000
The bodyguard watched Lin Nuoyan for days,

424
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,160
and it had been quiet.

425
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,480
Today is the first time
he's working after getting discharged.

426
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,200
A delivery man walked into his lab.

427
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,600
When the delivery man came out,
instead of a delivery scooter,

428
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,920
he got into a car.

429
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,360
The bodyguard cross-checked the photo
on the arrest warrant,

430
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,480
and found out that

431
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,960
he was Zhao Shan.

432
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,160
You never let me down.

433
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,320
This is the place.

434
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:38,800
Wait.

435
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,360
What are you doing here?

436
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:42,760
Where is he?

437
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,680
Sorry, sir.

438
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,760
We were late.

439
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,560
When we got here, the door was open

440
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,360
but no one was in.

441
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,880
This place

442
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,280
is a temporary den

443
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,200
to trick you idiots.

444
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,760
Let's go in and have a look.

445
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:57,880
Let's go.

446
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,200
There's a pair of slippers here.

447
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,800
This place does look like a temporary shelter.

448
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,160
Jiang Baiju,

449
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,640
it appears that he wasn't after Jin Xiaoyu

450
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,440
but Professor Lin.

451
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,320
Look.

452
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,720
Jin Xiaoyu's photos

453
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,720
were taken recently.

454
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,440
The older photos are those of Professor Lin.

455
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,520
Xiaoyu has no parents.

456
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,040
That's why when I started to investigate her,

457
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,040
I got nothing.

458
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,080
And recently, she moved into Buwenzhong.

459
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,720
So she basically disappeared from the world.

460
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,800
I investigated Professor Lin, too.

461
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,520
His parents died

462
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,520
when he was young.

463
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,200
His adoptive parents took him to the US

464
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,440
when he was ten years old.

465
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,520
In the US, he studied

466
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,280
(Clinical Microbiology Test)
genetics and bio-economics.

467
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,280
He got good grades.

468
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,640
And

469
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,640
he's into charity.

470
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,280
His adoptive parents retired

471
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,520
from a university in Washington.

472
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,720
Really?

473
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,280
If one's too perfect,

474
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,320
he's unlucky.

475
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,360
You're jealous.

476
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,800
Professor Lin

477
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,640
is a good-looking and highly-educated

478
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,640
charity-enthusiast.

479
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,920
Jin Xiaoyu...

480
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,040
I don't get it.

481
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,960
She chose you

482
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,240
over this guy.

483
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,400
It proves one thing, you know?

484
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,040
Women have

485
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,560
poor tastes.

486
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,600
The older, the more charming.

487
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,000
I pity you.

488
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,040
A young man

489
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,960
who knows so little.

490
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,120
Old man,

491
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,600
your roasting ability

492
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,520
has never improved.

493
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,040
He seemed like a decent guy

494
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,280
when he was young.

495
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,880
There was an accident

496
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,520
at this hospital, right?

497
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,120
The Third Affiliated Hospital of Central Hospital.

498
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,880
Their main work was medical research.

499
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,240
But there was an unexpected major accident.

500
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,120
These flowers.

501
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,800
I've been trying to find them for 80 years.

502
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,040
I'll never forget

503
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,440
what I saw.

504
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,000
We need to find this place.

505
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,000
What took you so long?

506
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,760
Why are you at home?

507
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:55,640
Come.

508
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,440
Come.

509
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,080
Good boy. Come.

510
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,960
How come you came home so late?

511
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,560
You...

512
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,760
I'll have lunch at home.

513
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,720
I'll sleep at home tonight.

514
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,040
This doesn't sound right.

515
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,800
It's not what you usually do.

516
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,840
Be honest with me.

517
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,000
Are you dating Ye Lai?

518
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,280
You're too direct.

519
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,640
Can you be circumbendibus?

520
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:16,840
Dad would

521
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,320
talk to me about the dog

522
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,400
and ask me if I want to keep a pet.

523
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,640
I said no.

524
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,080
Then he suspects that I have a girlfriend.

525
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,280
I see.

526
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:26,920
Do you want to keep a cat?

527
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:27,600
No.

528
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,200
What's happening between you and Ye Lai?

529
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,320
She asked me to go to an archery club.

530
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,280
Go-kart a few days ago,

531
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,520
and archery club now?

532
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,680
It's quite obvious.

533
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,840
Don't you mind?

534
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,520
She's your girlfriend.

535
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,880
Why would I mind?

536
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,520
I know what you're worried about.

537
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,600
You're worried that Mom and Dad
would find out about her past

538
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,520
and would disagree.

539
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,240
But she was the victim,

540
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,280
not the perpetrator.

541
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,040
If you don't mind,

542
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,600
no one does.

543
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,480
I don't mind.

544
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,000
It's like robbery.

545
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,240
No one's life would be ruined

546
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,160
after getting robbed once.

547
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,360
But to a girl,

548
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,600
damage like this

549
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,480
can ruin her life.

550
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,920
I find it ridiculous.

551
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,720
Yes.

552
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,600
No one is defective
because of the damage they had.

553
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,160
What Dad and Mom really care about

554
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,480
is you.

555
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,560
They don't want you to be hurt.

556
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,080
Dad and Mom are open-minded.

557
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,280
They don't judge a girl

558
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,360
because of something like that.

559
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,400
I learned something lately.

560
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,800
The Ye family didn't want
Ye Lai to return to China,

561
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,000
but she insisted on coming back to see you.

562
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,040
She even had a fight with her family.

563
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,680
Now that she's in China,

564
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,680
I bet she'll deal with
some stuff left from the past.

565
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,120
A girl came back for you

566
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,360
at all costs.

567
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,960
You're a man now.

568
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,320
You should know

569
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,360
that you should make yourself clear

570
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,000
whether you like her or not.

571
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,480
Tu.

572
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,880
If I'm having a relationship now,

573
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,560
how pressured will you be?

574
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,720
Darn you.

575
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,440
Get lost!

576
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,560
Nuonuo.

577
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,560
Tu.

578
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,960
What are you doing out here?

579
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,920
Why was Nuonuo so noisy?

580
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,000
He's dead.

581
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,280
Qian Cheng.

582
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,880
What's up with all those people?

583
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,800
I need to make myself clear.

584
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,120
I didn't get them here.

585
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,400
It's Xue Zaozao's fault.

586
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,480
I asked him to order a private room,

587
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,560
but he secretly told Peng Zichun.

588
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,400
Ever since Ye Lai came back,

589
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,880
Peng Zichun has been making attempts.

590
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,720
My brother has been helping him.

591
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,800
I never liked that playboy.

592
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,760
He's a loser

593
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,800
who acts like a boss.

594
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,080
Qian Cheng,

595
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,600
I was going to see Wanwan.

596
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,800
But I didn't expect there'd be

597
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,960
so many people.

598
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,080
It's fine.

599
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,080
You didn't invite them here.

600
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,600
What did I tell you?

601
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,440
Qian Cheng is a boss now.

602
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,360
He doesn't care how many people there are.

603
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,400
But remember,

604
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,080
I'll be paying

605
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,600
today.

606
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,040
Alright! Alright!

607
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,480
It's none of your business.

608
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,040
Do you have nowhere else to spend your money?

609
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,840
Have fun together.

610
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,360
Qian Cheng,

611
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,360
you go and get some Whiskey.

612
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,200
These are for women.

613
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,720
No one ever told me

614
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,680
these drinks were for women.

615
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,520
There are too many people here.

616
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,400
I'd like to speak to Qian Cheng in private.

617
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,720
I never liked Whiskey anyway.

618
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,840
If you want to talk about business,

619
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,040
I'm quite interested.

620
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,560
You and Xue Zaozao

621
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,760
opened up an entertainment company, right?

622
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,400
Qing'ai sponsored a program
that will be broadcasting online next month.

623
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,960
There are so many idols in your company.

624
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,760
Come and have fun.

625
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,800
About this,

626
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,160
you need to talk to Xue Zaozao.

627
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,840
I'm but one of the shareholders.

628
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,120
You can put your girlfriend in the program.

629
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,600
Qian Cheng can squeeze her in.

630
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,000
I don't have a girlfriend.

631
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,560
Don't listen to others' nonsense.

632
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,360
What's the name of the one

633
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,560
who won first place in your company's talent show?

634
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,680
Zihan.

635
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,440
Yes.

636
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,400
Zihan.

637
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,760
Zichun.

638
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,600
And Zihan.

639
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,840
What a perfect match.

640
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,520
Wanwan.

641
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,120
Let's sing.

642
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,000
Sure.

643
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,920
♪Read me between the lines♪

644
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,000
♪My unintended harsh words♪

645
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:56,040
♪I'm unwilling to be away from Darling,
but I'm even more unwilling to be away from you♪

646
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,000
Where is Qian Cheng?

647
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,000
Why isn't he back yet?

648
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,800
Maybe it's too crowded here,

649
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,880
so he went out for some time alone.

650
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,560
Why don't we go and find him?

651
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,200
Miss, they are fighting.

652
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,000
They are fighting?

653
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,760
Who is fighting whom?

654
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,040
Your two friends.

655
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:17,680
Go, go, go!

656
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,720
- Go, go, go!
- Go have a look.

657
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,360
Let's go and have a look.

658
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,480
Over there!

659
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,960
You!

660
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,920
What are you doing? Sit down!

661
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,520
Qian Cheng, are you alright?

662
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,320
Zichun!

663
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,640
How are you, Zichun?

664
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,240
Qian Cheng.

665
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:30,960
You...

666
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,760
Are you okay?

667
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,320
Don't just stand there!

668
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,040
Call the ambulance!

669
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,000
(Mu City Health Care Hospital)

670
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,600
Qian Tu,

671
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,880
is this a hospital or a prison?

672
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,840
A special hospital
for compulsory medical treatment.

673
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,680
It's close to a prison.

674
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,640
If he didn't have psychological illness,

675
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,000
he'd be in prison sooner or later.

676
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,240
Peng Zichun

677
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,880
was badly injured.

678
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,480
I shouldn't have let Qian Cheng

679
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,320
go on the date.

680
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,640
Cheng Weilan was right.

681
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,960
Once one is in love,

682
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,520
they'll have strong emotional changes.

683
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,880
There's no point in saying that now.

684
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,360
Let's go.

685
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,560
Cheng, are you okay?

686
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,880
Are they giving you enough food?

687
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,520
Are those two fat guys mean to you?

688
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,120
Sit down.

689
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Just a temporary detention.

690
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,840
He's only showing mild symptoms.

691
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,160
I'll talk to the Peng family

692
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,480
some other day.

693
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,080
Are you feeling better?

694
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,240
I eat and sleep on time.

695
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,880
No work, no worries.

696
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,480
This is like a vacation.

697
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,320
Vacation?

698
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,800
Why would they be watching over you
if this was a vacation?

699
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:51,680
Uh...

700
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,160
Cheng, don't worry.

701
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,840
I promise we'll get you out of here.

702
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:55,960
Don't worry.

703
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,760
Qian Cheng,

704
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,960
listen to me.

705
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,040
You just

706
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,600
forget about everything

707
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,360
and get some good rest.

708
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,720
I'll try to negotiate

709
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:06,880
with the Peng family

710
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,920
to reach a settlement. Okay?

711
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,680
Yeah.

712
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,600
I'm Xue Zaozao's friend.

713
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,080
And he's Peng Zichun's friend.

714
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,680
If we can't figure it out,

715
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,280
we can ask for his help

716
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,120
and compensate Peng Zichun.

717
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,800
The thing between me and Peng Zichun

718
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,320
is different from the thing
between you and Xue Zaozao.

719
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,720
He did it for his sister

720
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:22,960
whereas I...

721
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,240
I knew that!

722
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,680
We should have listened to your mother

723
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,880
and forbidden you from dating Ye Lai.

724
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,800
Can you talk less

725
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,000
on an occasion like this?

726
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,080
They said

727
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,920
the psychiatric evaluation
will be on next Wednesday.

728
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:38,800
I got it.

729
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,720
I'll speak to Chief Fan

730
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,320
in advance.

731
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,520
Don't worry.

732
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,280
The most important thing for you now

733
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,320
is to rest well.

734
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,840
Jiang Baiju, is something on your mind?

735
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,320
Is it about Qian Cheng?

736
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,520
Him?

737
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,680
This is an obvious trick,

738
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,960
and I won't fall for it.

739
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,080
I just think

740
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,320
that Lin Nuoyan being discharged from the hospital

741
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,840
combined with the problem Cheng is having

742
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,480
seems a little suspicious.

743
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,240
It can't be that simple.

744
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,560
You're unbelievable.

745
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,320
Qian Cheng

746
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,120
and Lin Nuoyan?

747
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,320
Can you focus on me?

748
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,120
How is it possible?

749
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,480
Jiang Baiju.

750
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,320
Do you believe in

751
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,640
destiny?

752
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,960
In 1941, I went home

753
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,960
to reunite with my family.

754
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,480
I was going to have myself cured,

755
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,000
but that war

756
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,520
took my family away.

757
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,320
I left my hometown along with Dao Qiang,

758
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,600
and it was a narrow escape

759
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,720
before I made it abroad.

760
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,680
But when I was abroad,

761
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,440
I didn't get the answer I wanted.

762
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,800
In that period of time,

763
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,880
I missed my hometown all the time.

764
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,480
It doesn't feel good to be homeless.

765
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,640
But now you have a home.

766
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,000
And everything will be fine.

767
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,520
Right?

768
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,280
It's okay

769
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,160
even if it doesn't.

770
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,640
It's normal for people to come

771
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,680
and go.

772
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,440
Everybody has their own path of growth.

773
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,040
Their outlook on the world

774
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,000
and different attitudes

775
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,920
may change their direction of life

776
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,800
at a change of mind.

777
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,000
So everybody

778
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,800
has their unique ending.

779
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,680
All right.

780
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,760
Cheer up!

781
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,800
Smile.

782
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,840
I'm fine.

783
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,080
It's just I can't help with these legal affairs.

784
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,120
I can only sit around being worried.

785
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,000
Ye Lai

786
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,240
knew Cheng in high school.

787
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,200
They went through adversities,

788
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:47,880
misery,

789
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,040
and illness together.

790
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,920
So she

791
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,920
cares about Cheng more than anything.

792
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,040
Such care

793
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,800
may be good for a normal person.

794
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,160
But for someone with a psychological illness,

795
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,600
it might not be the case.

796
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,720
That's why I'm worried about him.

797
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,840
It's still unknown for now,

798
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,280
whether the CEO's resignation

799
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,960
will cause any impact on Qing'ai.

800
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,720
The third-generation designer

801
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,600
Mr. Dao Ruifeng told the public

802
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,000
that the new CEO shall be announced soon.

803
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,680
William.

804
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,600
How is Qian Cheng doing?

805
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,880
He said he's fine.

806
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,840
That he's doing great.

807
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,040
But I know

808
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:37,800
he was only comforting me.

809
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,680
I went to that place.

810
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,120
It's basically a prison.

811
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,040
A madhouse.

812
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,200
I went there

813
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,000
and saw that the chairs and tables
were nailed to the ground.

814
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,840
And I saw two strong male nurses

815
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,640
with him.

816
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,800
How can I let him stay there?

817
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,240
Please calm down.

818
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,920
I have something to discuss with you.

819
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,480
What is it?

820
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,600
I caused all of this.

821
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,760
I'm thinking if I could speak to Peng Zichun.

822
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,160
What's the point?

823
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,040
His family is unreasonable.

824
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,880
Peng Zichun would only take advantage of you.

825
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,040
William, listen to me.

826
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,680
I came back with the purpose of

827
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,880
taking Qian Cheng to the US to have him treated.

828
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,920
I told him already.

829
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,520
He promised that he'd think about it.

830
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,320
If it weren't for the accident,

831
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,240
we'd be in the US by now.

832
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,360
He wants to go to the States with you?

833
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,160
He didn't tell me about it.

834
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,960
Maybe

835
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,400
he hasn't decided

836
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,680
how to break it to you.

837
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,320
Anyway,

838
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,120
I have made up my mind.

839
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,320
No matter what happens,

840
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,840
I'll be with him through thick and thin.

841
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,120
William.

842
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,760
Because of their fight,

843
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,600
my family wants me to return to the US.

844
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,560
So before I leave,

845
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,520
I'd like to try one more time for Qian Cheng.

846
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,480
Peng Zichun will take advantage of you.

847
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,840
But my family has influence, too.

848
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,120
He can't do anything about me.

849
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,560
How about

850
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,960
you help me ask Xue Wanwan?

851
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,400
Xue Zaozao must know

852
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,800
which hospital Peng Zichun is in.

853
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,080
If the Peng family knows
you're going to beg for Qian Cheng,

854
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,160
they'll be mad at you.

855
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,000
If you do this,

856
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,200
Qian will be worried.

857
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,520
How about

858
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,440
you going with me?

859
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,720
You wait for me outside.

860
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,000
There are nurses.

861
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,000
There won't be any danger.

862
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,120
I'll go with you.

863
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,120
Thank you, William.

864
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,040
No need to thank me.

865
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,480
Qian Cheng's my best mate.

866
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:29,840
I'll go.

867
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,760
I never expected him to be in your hospital.

868
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,560
Yeah.

869
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,200
I told you

870
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,160
that our orthopedics department
is first-class nationwide.

871
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,320
But I just asked.

872
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,560
Only some parts of his bones were broken.

873
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,000
He can dine without any problems.

874
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,640
My brother said

875
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,560
Peng Zichun asked to see
Ye Lai as soon as he woke up.

876
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,040
Why did you cut in?

877
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,240
He's like a madman.

878
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,400
Ye Lai,

879
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,320
your visit

880
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,160
might just turn things around.

881
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,280
You're like a mad person

882
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,760
every time you ask to see William.

883
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,600
It's about visiting hours.

884
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,200
Ye Lai will follow me in first.

885
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,040
Because of the registration policy,

886
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,840
you guys wait here.

887
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,360
I'll go talk to the doctor, okay?

888
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,160
- Okay.
- Let's go.

889
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:14,840
Can I

890
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,560
talk to you about something?

891
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,400
Can you not

892
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,000
look at me like a creep?

893
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,000
You're scaring me.

894
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,480
I joined Cheng Weilan's volunteer association.

895
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,280
Organ donation?

896
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,360
I'll do good things later.

897
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,640
Am I brilliant?

898
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,400
You aren't some kind of artist in trouble.

899
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,040
There's no need for you
to clear your name through charity.

900
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,800
You're unhappy?

901
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,080
No.

902
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,840
I never yelled at you.

903
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,040
But after the incident,

904
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,760
my best mate is in a prison-like hospital,

905
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,720
and my own family is in a mess.

906
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,120
Can you please behave?

907
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,560
Don't cause more troubles for me.

908
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,400
Please.

909
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,560
It's okay that you like Cheng Weilan.

910
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,480
I'll be better and better,

911
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,320
just like her.

912
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,560
But liking someone

913
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,080
doesn't mean that they have to be perfect.

914
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,280
Dao Ruifeng!

915
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:16,600
I...

916
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,000
Brother!

917
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,120
What are you doing?

918
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,080
What?

919
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,200
-What are you doing?
-Let's go.

920
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,200
Stop it.

921
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,160
It's a fight between my brother and my boyfriend.

922
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:26,920
It has nothing to do with you.

923
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,320
I'll kick your butt if you take one step closer.

924
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,080
Shoo.

925
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,960
William, get him.

926
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,600
You ingrate sister!

927
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,640
Brother, do your best, too.

928
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,800
The Xue family can't lose.

929
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,760
Shut up, Xue Wanwan!

930
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,280
My dear, protect your face.

931
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,200
Shut up!

932
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,120
Why did you get yourself involved?

933
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,400
Qian Cheng hit Peng Zichun.

934
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,920
You fought Xue Zaozao.

935
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,480
You are good brothers, aren't you?

936
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,360
Grandmother.

937
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,960
He hit me first.

938
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,000
He's the one in the hospital,

939
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,720
not you.

940
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,200
You're supposed to safeguard Young Master.

941
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,320
I don't even blame you
for your dereliction of duty,

942
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,080
but what about Qian Cheng?

943
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,720
It's been ten years.

944
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,000
The Qian family entrusted him with you

945
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,120
because they trust you and us.

946
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,760
How can you face your friend?

947
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,320
Grandmother.

948
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,000
Qian Cheng hurt him badly

949
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,480
at the KTV?

950
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,480
He's amazing.

951
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,440
I can hardly believe it.

952
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,920
What is so unbelievable?

953
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,520
Would all the customers and waiters

954
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,760
make the same mistake?

955
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,520
Could it be a made-up story?

956
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:35,560
Mother.

957
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:36,920
Calm down.

958
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,840
Calm down, please.

959
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,760
C-Come here.

960
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,120
The Qian family aren't fools.

961
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,040
If there

962
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,560
is an inside story,

963
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,320
they will certainly find it out.

964
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,040
But what I didn't understand

965
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,760
was why you went along with Ye Lai

966
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,200
to meet Peng Zichun?

967
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:54,680
I...

968
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,720
I-I'm worried about her.

969
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,200
Xue Zaozao came up to me and hit me for no reason,

970
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:00,640
so I...

971
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,080
Enough! Stop justifying yourself!

972
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,840
I've booked you an air ticket to France today.

973
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,280
Your parents are expecting you at the airport.

974
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:06,880
Grandmother,

975
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,360
I can't leave right now.

976
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,600
You, too, know you can't leave at this time, huh?

977
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,360
Then why did you cause troubles?

978
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,880
Be good.

979
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,600
The longer you stay here,

980
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,800
the bigger the mess you'll cause.

981
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:22,920
Listen to your uncle.

982
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,720
Go home and stay with your parents.

983
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,000
When we sort it out,

984
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,800
you can come back.

985
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:27,600
Everything will remain the same.

986
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,960
Uncle, I can't leave!

987
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,080
How can I leave Qian Cheng behind?

988
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,960
What are you talking about?

989
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,320
You can't leave him behind?

990
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,600
What? Are you going to be hospitalized with him?

991
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,040
Look at your injury.

992
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,360
It breaks my heart.

993
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,880
Listen to me. Go home.

994
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,000
You always wanted to go home, right?

995
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,560
Sooner rather than later, right?

996
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,040
Now, you...

997
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,520
No!

998
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,880
Go home and get some rest.

999
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,320
Grandmother!

1000
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,120
Go home and write your stories.

1001
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,440
Go, go, go.

1002
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:50,920
Go.

1003
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,200
You'll be late for the flight.

1004
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,280
The top priority now

1005
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,880
is the management of Qing'ai.

1006
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,000
The CEO resigned abruptly.

1007
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,600
William, the designer,

1008
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,600
returns to France all of a sudden.

1009
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,800
All the work

1010
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,560
needs to be rearranged.

1011
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,520
Mr. Liu can do some of it.

1012
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,040
As for the rest,

1013
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,040
I'll deal with them myself.

1014
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,600
You?

1015
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,760
It's been decades.

1016
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,280
There had never been a scenario where

1017
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,600
a CEO of Qing'ai needed compulsory treatment.

1018
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,120
Only by handling things myself

1019
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,680
can the situation stay under control.

1020
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,520
I think

1021
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,720
neither the Peng family
nor the Xue family will let it slide.

1022
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,560
Prepare for upcoming turmoils.

1023
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:02,960
(Qing'ai Group)

1024
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,480
William.

1025
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,800
I, William, have a great reputation since ever.

1026
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,440
But now only one person is here to see me off?

1027
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,200
Jin Xiaoyu said

1028
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,280
you only informed me.

1029
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,480
Who else are you expecting?

1030
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,320
Right.

1031
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,520
Umm...

1032
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,640
Come closer.

1033
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:23,880
What?

1034
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,680
I'm leaving.

1035
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,520
Kiss me goodbye.

1036
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,560
Have you grown tired of your brain?

1037
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,440
I'll donate it on your behalf.

1038
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:31,840
I was...

1039
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,600
I was only joking.

1040
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,400
But think about it.

1041
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,280
Lan,

1042
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,120
I sincerely want to be with you. Please...

1043
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:42,640
Think about it.

1044
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,920
I've prepared what you asked for.

1045
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,120
Think about it.

1046
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,560
Also, tell Qian

1047
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,160
that I'll be back for him.

1048
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,600
That I won't leave him behind.

1049
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,560
I'm off.

1050
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,080
Take care.

1051
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:56,560
Bye-bye.

1052
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,480
My...

1053
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,000
My stomach.

1054
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,680
I need to go to the bathroom.

1055
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:07,600
