00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,740
Qingqing has magic power now.

194
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,740
She would react before she hits water.

195
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,700
She can save herself.

196
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,660
She's got more magic power than you do.

197
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:52,700
You...

198
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,700
I never thought I'd

199
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,980
end up like you in love.

200
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,740
Don't compare me to you about love issues!

201
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,940
Wan Qing has been so nice to me lately.

202
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,260
She is like a different person.

203
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,420
Why?

204
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:13,660
I don't know.

205
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:14,980
Maybe

206
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,460
she had been subdued by my personal charisma.

207
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,300
Alright.

208
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,180
You can't see her,

209
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,260
but I can.

210
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,820
Maybe I can ask her out someday

211
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:30,980
and put in a good word for you.

212
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,140
Today is an appropriate day.

213
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,020
Right now.

214
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,820
Right, now.

215
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,300
Come here. Here.

216
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:42,740
Come on.

217
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:43,780
Look,

218
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,460
you write a letter to Qingqing

219
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,340
and invite her to my home.

220
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,620
I'll cook by myself.

221
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,420
She'd be happy!

222
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,340
No. No. No.

223
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,940
If I ask her to come to my home,

224
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,780
it's certain that she won't come.

225
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,980
So we'd better invite her to the Yuejiao teahouse

226
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,740
and I'll cook for her at home.

227
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,820
After finishing, I'll send the dishes to the teahouse.

228
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,140
Nangong,

229
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,370
you are screwed!

230
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:09,380
You've fallen into her hands!

231
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,370
Look at your attitude

232
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,540
when talking about Lu Qingqing.

233
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,570
I'm the host,

234
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,980
so I should take good care of my guest.

235
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:18,930
OK. OK.

236
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:19,980
I can help you,

237
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,300
but you should promise not

238
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,540
to use your magic power.

239
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,420
Your Highness,

240
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,620
I have prepared well.

241
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,020
The guards who patrol the Library Pavilion

242
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:30,690
tonight have been scattered.

243
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,060
Great.

244
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,060
Lingyu,

245
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:35,940
prepare a carriage for me.

246
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,100
I will take Qingqing to the Library Pavilion again.

247
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,340
And this time,

248
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,820
she can check the ancient books carefully.

249
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,180
[Qingyun mansion]

250
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:49,860
Pay respect to you, Lady Qingqing.

251
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:51,700
Lingyu?

252
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,660
What's the matter?

253
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,140
Crown Prince invites you to enter the palace

254
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:56,900
and you can read the collection intently.

255
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,060
Really?

256
00:13:58,850 --> 00:13:59,380
That's great!

257
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,580
Lady Qingqing, please prepare

258
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,660
and wait for Crown Price to take you

259
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,940
to the palace for the feast.

260
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,100
Baihe,

261
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,300
help me with my makeup, quickly!

262
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,660
I'll go to a feast tonight.

263
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,700
But...what about Lord Sikong?

264
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,020
It doesn't matter.

265
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,780
You can go and tell him that

266
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,860
I'll invite him some other day.

267
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,020
Xiaowu,

268
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,140
do you think these dishes are enough?

269
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:27,900
Will she like them?

270
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,380
That's enough, Your Highness.

271
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,300
If you keep cooking,

272
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,740
the dishes will be enough

273
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,820
for the whole family.

274
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:36,900
You know what?

275
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,060
As long as she likes them.

276
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,610
She lost weight the last time I saw her.

277
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:40,780
Lost weight?

278
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,970
Why didn't I feel that?

279
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,540
Pretty good.

280
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:49,820
Your Grace,

281
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,740
as you expected,

282
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,500
Lady Qingqing has stopped seeing Lord Jin recently.

283
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:55,300
Great.

284
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,100
But Crown prince has met

285
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,930
Lady Qingqing many times recently.

286
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,780
He also invited Lady Qingqing to enter the palace

287
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,580
and have dinner together tonight.

288
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,820
Estrange her from Lord Jin

289
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,140
and let her accept the Crown Prince's kindness.

290
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,380
We may hear

291
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,060
good news from them soon.

292
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,420
If so,

293
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,020
you can get the magic power stone soon.

294
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:16,740
Your Grace,

295
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,940
I just saw the carriage of Crown Prince

296
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,700
came to the gate of our mansion.

297
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,300
I think it's picking up Lord Qingqing.

298
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,540
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

299
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,060
Quickly! Quickly!

300
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:36,860
[Fengling Hall]

301
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:33,500
Qingqing...

302
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,540
Pay respects to you, Your Highness.

303
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,660
Lord Lu.

304
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,860
You have invited my daughter Qingqing frequently recently

305
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,180
with great care.

306
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,300
I heard that you are getting along very well.

307
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,570
I'm delighted to hear that.

308
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,140
If you need any

309
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,340
help from me,

310
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,340
just let me know.

311
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,580
I'll support you as much as I can.

312
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,740
Thank you for your kindness.

313
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,420
It's just that I can't

314
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,050
approve of your methods.

315
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,100
A few days ago,

316
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,340
I heard that you were so stunned

317
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,740
by what Qingqing

318
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:14,700
had done.

319
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,220
But I didn't expect that

320
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,340
you could even

321
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,100
hurt your own daughter.

322
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,980
I wonder what you're talking about.

323
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,700
I think there's been some misunderstanding between us.

324
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,260
You are a prudent

325
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:34,740
and resourceful person,

326
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,860
so you must understand what I'm talking about.

327
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,780
Please don't interfere in

328
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,020
the affair between Qingqing and me.

329
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,620
Yes, Your Highness.

330
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:56,860
Your Grace.

331
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,180
You can leave.

332
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,460
Crown prince became more and more angry with me.

333
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,740
If he does take the throne,

334
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,619
he's gonna kick me out of the way.

335
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,540
After getting the magic stone,

336
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,819
I need to clear away this piece of chess.

337
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,460
Your Highness,

338
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,619
you've prepared for Lady Qingqing

339
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,569
so many dishes,

340
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:18,819
she would be very happy

341
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:19,700
if she comes.

342
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,420
I'm coming.

343
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,180
Alright, stop.

344
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,180
She didn't come with me.

345
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:29,820
Let's eat.

346
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,300
Where is Qingqing?

347
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,660
She can't come here today.

348
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,980
What the hell happened?

349
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,820
Why couldn't she come?

350
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,540
She was picked up by Crown Prince.

351
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,180
The dishes taste good.

352
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,540
Xiaowu, carriage.

353
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,460
Yes, Your Highness.

354
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:46,900
What?

355
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,700
Where are you going?

356
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:52,500
Qingqing,

357
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,140
I think you haven't had

358
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,410
a good meal for a long time.

359
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:56,660
I haven't

360
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,660
eaten dinner either.

361
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,460
Let's have dinner while chatting.

362
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,100
Lord Jin...

363
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,220
Such a big meal!

364
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,300
You two didn't even invite me!

365
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,340
Your Highness,

366
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,500
Lord Jin said he wanted to speak with you

367
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,540
and I haven't had a chance to report.

368
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,420
Brother, you are ill now,

369
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,940
so you'd better rest at home

370
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,420
rather than hang out randomly.

371
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,140
I have heart disease.

372
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,980
Lying down all day is not

373
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,460
conducive to my recovery.

374
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,220
Now that you're here,

375
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,740
you should have something important to tell Crown Prince.

376
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,100
Then I won't bother anymore.

377
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,740
I'll leave...

378
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,290
Stop. Stop.

379
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,380
I have nothing important to say.

380
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,940
It's just that the weather tonight is pretty good,

381
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,540
so I came to find Mingyang to have a drink

382
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,660
and have a relax.

383
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,620
But today,

384
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,180
I want to talk to Qingqing.

385
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,060
If you want to drink with me,

386
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,500
I'll prepare good wine and food and

387
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,780
invite you some other day, okay?

388
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,340
Qingqing,

389
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,410
do you agree with him?

390
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,140
Alright. Why are we standing?

391
00:18:59,140 --> 00:18:59,860
Take a seat.

392
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:01,580
Come on,

393
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,620
add one more set of chopsticks here.

394
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,180
Yes.

395
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:05,940
Qingqing, take it easy.

396
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,660
I'll keep your secret.

397
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:17,570
Qingqing,

398
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,340
come here.

399
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:20,930
Qingqing,

400
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,660
come on, have a try.

401
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,060
Eat the shrimp.

402
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,500
And a meatball.

403
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,020
Vegetable is good for your health.

404
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,180
We should have a good appetizer before eating.

405
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:47,660
Qingqing,

406
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:48,860
how is it?

407
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,170
Made by the chef in the palace,

408
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,380
of course they are delicious.

409
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:53,740
Eat more.

410
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:55,980
Mingyang,

411
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,660
the dishes look quite substantial,

412
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,020
but I don't know whether they also taste well.

413
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,820
This shrimp with green vegetable

414
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,860
doesn't look good to eat.

415
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,980
I didn't know that

416
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,610
you boast such a high

417
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,780
level of research on dishes.

418
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,420
I have spent a long time in No Magic Valley

419
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,340
and always eat fresh food.

420
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,380
So my taste

421
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,820
is hard to adapt to the dishes here.

422
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,380
You can ask Qingqing if you don't believe me,

423
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,700
and she definitely knows my feelings.

424
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,100
I just came back from No Magic Valley.

425
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,060
You can come to my home if you want to try the flavor,

426
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:23,780
and I'll cook it for you.

427
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,060
I promise you won't be disappointed.

428
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,620
It would be nice to try the ingredients in Ghost Valley.

429
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,420
But I was born in Qiyuan continent,

430
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,500
so the food here suits me better.

431
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:34,620
You've got a point there.

432
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,220
From my perspective,

433
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,740
good food and wonderful times

434
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,260
should be shared

435
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,700
with the right person.

436
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,460
Sometimes what you want is just the opposite,

437
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,940
one step backward and you may find a better way.

438
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,660
What do you think, my brother?

439
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,580
Compulsion is a kind of

440
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,380
paranoia about hopeless love.

441
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:55,780
I'm not that kind of person.

442
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,820
I just want my lover

443
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,900
to see the truth

444
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,460
and get together with me again.

445
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,300
I'm full.

446
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,460
Try his dessert.

447
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,500
Now that she is full,

448
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,180
there's no need for you to force her.

449
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,300
Of course I know she is full.

450
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,780
I don't want to impose it on her, either.

451
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,340
But, Mingyang,

452
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,860
have you ever thought about her?

453
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:21,900
How do you know I haven't thought of her?

454
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,340
If you really knew her taste,

455
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,140
you wouldn't have set the meal according to your own taste.

456
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,570
Do you really know what she likes?

457
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,860
Do you think that you are

458
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,290
the person who knows her the best?

459
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,540
Qingqing,

460
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,500
who knows you the best?

461
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,450
You know the answer clearly, right?

462
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,500
Can you stop?

463
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,420
It looks like you guys didn't really want to eat this dinner.

464
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,340
I feel on pins and needles here,

465
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,620
so I may as well leave now.

466
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:43,900
- Qingqing!
- Qingqing!

467
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,620
By the way, I have a proposition.

468
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,460
The weather is fine these days,

469
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,740
o maybe we can go for an excursion

470
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,500
to enjoy the scenery.

471
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,340
Mingyang,

472
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,060
we haven't gone to hunting ground for a long time.

473
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,700
Do you dare to go to the hunting ground

474
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,460
and have a match with me tomorrow?

475
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,340
Since you're in such high spirits,

476
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,620
I'd like to have a match with you.

477
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,380
No.

478
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,220
You're sick now.

479
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,780
You can't stand the physical exertion.

480
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,100
I'm healthy now.

481
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,260
Don't forget that

482
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,620
hunting is my forte.

483
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,300
Qingqing, you can go with me tomorrow.

484
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,380
I don't know how to hunt.

485
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,420
I'll pass.

486
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,620
It's okay. It's okay.

487
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:20,580
Qingqing,

488
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:21,610
if you're gonna go with us tomorrow,

489
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:22,740
I'll choose a good horse for you.

490
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,180
That's no need.

491
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,700
I'll prepare everything for Qingqing.

492
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,220
Qingqing hasn't agreed to go with us yet.

493
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,140
Of course she would hesitate about your invitation.

494
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,500
What's to hesitate about...

495
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,460
Qingqing,

496
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,380
you'll be my best partner when playing cuju.

497
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,340
We are the best opponents

498
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,260
with mutual respect and admiration.

499
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,060
Alright. Alright.

500
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,340
I'll go.

501
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,540
Your Grace.

502
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,620
If you have nothing else to say today,

503
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,100
the morning court ends.

504
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,220
Yes.

505
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,140
General Murong.

506
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,060
Your Highness,

507
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,060
I have something important to report.

508
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,860
I received a letter recently,

509
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,020
and it said that someone killed General Han.

510
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,400
[General Han had been murdered. The witness will appear at the right time.]

511
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,260
Someone saw the murder case at the scene

512
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,260
and could testify.

513
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,220
Where was this letter from?

514
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,420
I don't know.

515
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,980
The messenger secretly delivered the letter to my study.

516
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,580
I think General Han died in an unnatural way.

517
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,380
Now with this letter,

518
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:51,260
I request to investigate General Han's death thoroughly.

519
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:52,940
OK.

520
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,730
I'll hand over this case to you.

521
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,610
Subject to your will.

522
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:08,900
Qi Yi,

523
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,380
you've worked for me for years.

524
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,420
How did you make that mistake?

525
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:15,940
Your Grace,

526
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,940
it was a dark night so it was hard to tell people.

527
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,620
That secret defend plotted against me.

528
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,020
It was my fault.

529
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,140
Please forgive me for my fault.

530
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,820
Where is that person?

531
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,060
He is hiding in Lord Jin Mansion.

532
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,580
Lord Jin Mansion?

533
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,100
It seems that Nangong Yixin

534
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,420
had already known about this matter.

535
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,380
He should be killed.

536
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,540
Your Grace,

537
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,300
according to the palace guard,

538
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,420
after Lady Qingqing was taken into the palace,

539
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,420
Lord Jin also went to the palace.

540
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,700
Crown Prince and Lord Jin

541
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,060
made an appointment to go hunting at the hunting ground tomorrow.

542
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,540
They also invited Lady Qingqing.

543
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,620
Hunting ground...

544
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,260
He just showed up out of nowhere,

545
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,140
so I didn't even have a chance to ask

546
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,540
Crown Prince for clues about the glacial poison.

547
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,980
Lord Jin is a spoony man.

548
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,060
He may have

549
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,220
misunderstood your relationship with Crown Prince.

550
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,780
You didn't see that

551
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,580
they quarreled

552
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,380
just like two kids fighting over candy.

553
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:26,780
My lady.

554
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:28,810
What does it mean?

555
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,370
It means they are rivals in love and jealous each other when they meet.

556
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:32,940
Don't move.

557
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,620
You love me so much,

558
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,900
but why aren't you jealous?

559
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,460
Stop.

560
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,620
I made it clear to Crown Prince

561
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,860
that we were just friends.

562
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,340
He said he would respect my decision.

563
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:47,900
But do you really think that

564
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,900
Crown Prince cares about you only as a friend?

565
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:55,020
Although I can't be with Nangong right now,

566
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,020
I can make sure the one I like is him.

567
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,980
As for the prince,

568
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,780
I was destined not to respond to his love.

569
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,100
We can just be friends.

570
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,820
And also, my sister loves him so much.

571
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,820
I need to keep myself apart from him

572
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,900
so that no one would take it the wrong way.

573
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,500
Love is a really troublesome business.

574
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:15,300
By the way,

575
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,130
you didn't go to the Library Pavilion today.

576
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,100
Will you go there again tomorrow?

577
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,380
They are going to the hunting ground tomorrow.

578
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,890
Hunting ground?

579
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:25,730
Will you go with them?

580
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,340
I'm afraid they'd fight again.

581
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,580
And if Nangong's health goes wrong again,

582
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,100
I'll be worried.

583
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,450
My lady,

584
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,020
take it easy.

585
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,180
His poison wouldn't break out

586
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,100
as long as you keep the distance with him.

587
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,260
He has no problem riding and hunting.

588
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,620
I hope so.

589
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,100
Your highness, Lady Qingqing,

590
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,540
please choose a horse you like.

591
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,460
You choose first, my brother.

592
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,540
You two choose first.

593
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,330
I can ride any horse, you know.

594
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,460
What about Qingqing?

595
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:15,580
Which one do you like?

596
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,020
I'd choose the brown one.

597
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,820
OK. Then I'll choose the white one.

598
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:23,860
Have you decided yet?

599
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,980
Don't blame the horse when you lose.

600
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,900
Well, let's see who will be the winner.

601
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:36,780
Brother,

602
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:40,100
the black horse seems to have a bad temper.

603
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,890
How about we change our horses?

604
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,780
Sure.

605
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,020
I can win with any horse.

606
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,020
Today I compete with you,

607
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,650
we're using the number of prey as a standard within two hours.

608
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:56,700
Who that has more prey wins.

609
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,020
What do you think?

610
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:58,700
OK.

611
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,340
Alright.

612
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,900
Then I'll do my best

613
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,580
to compete with you.

614
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,100
Don't cry if you lose.

615
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,290
Nangong's horse

616
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,860
doesn't seem right.

617
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,460
Your archery is always excellent.

618
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,100
Why can't you perform well today?

619
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,380
Are you araid of losing

620
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:54,860
or just let me win deliberately?

621
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:57,060
I never thought of it that way.

622
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,140
Why do you stimulate me?

623
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:58,940
In that case,

624
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,940
you'd better try your best.

625
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,540
I want to have a fair fight with you.

626
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:47,740
Nangong,

627
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,660
why is your horse so disobedient?

628
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,260
That's okay.

629
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,050
The good horse is hard to tame.

630
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,500
Well, if it's a good horse,

631
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,380
give me a try.

632
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,380
You?

633
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,100
What?

634
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,700
You can tame it,

635
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,860
can't I?

636
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,900
Now is the right time to ask her.

637
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,300
OK. Give you.

638
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:15,740
Qingqing,

639
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,300
why did you avoid me

640
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,300
after reading the letter the other day?

641
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,410
Don't you believe me?

642
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,090
Which letter?

643
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,660
The letter I asked Xiaowu to send to you.

644
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,450
Didn't you see it?

645
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,700
Xiaowu?

646
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,140
Letter?

647
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:31,740
Qingqing,

648
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,900
you've been avoiding me

649
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,740
ever since you found out I had the poison.

650
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,170
I know you're worried about me.

651
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,140
But now I've found a way

652
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,020
to control the poison.

653
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,140
You really don't have to be burdened.

654
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,740
Have you cured your glacial poison?

655
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:42,660
I...

656
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,730
You're lying.

657
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,660
There's no way to cure it.

658
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,620
I looked it up.

659
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,260
Qingqing, listen to me.

660
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,020
Let me go.

661
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,060
Listen to...

662
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,420
You shouldn't force other people, brother.

663
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:00,700
Don't force Qingqing.

664
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,810
I need to explain it to Qingqing.

665
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,220
Many things don't need explanations.

666
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,740
We believe in what our eyes see.

667
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,140
You are in poor health.

668
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,460
A few days ago, you fainted

669
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,420
because of the use of magic power.

670
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,700
I was worried about your health

671
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,060
when we decided to go hunting.

672
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,060
If you insist on what you do

673
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:14,980
and neglect your health,

674
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,060
then I can only

675
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,820
send you home and have a rest forcibly.

676
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:18,940
What happened between us

677
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,940
is none of your business.

678
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,380
Could you just let us work it out by ourselves?

679
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,140
It's almost time to finish the competition.

680
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,130
Your prey is far less than me.

681
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,460
Are you going to throw in the towel?

682
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,580
Can you two just stop arguing?

683
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,740
Qingqing, believe me.

684
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,260
I hope you can respect Qingqing's choice.

685
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,020
She doesn't want to see you now.

686
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:46,500
Mingyang,

687
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,100
you know that my glacial poison has been sealed.

688
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:49,700
Brother,

689
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,460
you can hide for a while that

690
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,380
you don't have magic power,

691
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,460
but you can't keep the secret forever!

692
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:54,860
If she knows it later,

693
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,210
she will be sadder and more guilty

694
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:56,850
than he is now.

695
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,340
Can you bear to see her suffer like this?

696
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,660
It’s better to have short pains than long ones.

697
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,380
You are never meant to be together.

698
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,460
What happened?

699
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,380
Stop!

700
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,860
- Qingqing!
- Stop!

701
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:37,900
Stop!

702
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,460
Lady Qingqing!

703
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:45,580
Qingqing!

704
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:48,100
Nangong,

705
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,660
Don't come over. It's a trap!

706
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,180
Don't get closer!

707
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:56,700
Nangong!

708
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,140
Your Highness!

709
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,890
Lord Jin and Lady Qingqing fell into a trap in the woods.

710
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:13,860
Trap?

711
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,060
Brother.

712
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,220
Nangong,

713
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:53,020
are you alright?

714
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:53,620
I'm okay.

715
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,180
I was tied by the magic-restrained net

716
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,140
so I couldn't use my magic power.

717
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,100
How dare the rob!

718
00:33:59,180 --> 00:33:59,860
Who the hell

719
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,620
made traps on my hunting grounds!

720
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:04,820
I always think there's something wrong with this horse.

721
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,050
That's the case.

722
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:08,940
This thing is so strange.

723
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,250
Few people know

724
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:11,500
about hunting today.

725
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,219
I will get to the bottom of this

726
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:14,449
and give you a result.

727
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:16,770
Mingyang,

728
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:18,940
I'm just an idle Lord,

729
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,100
so it's not a big deal if I'm killed.

730
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,980
But if you are the person who is assassinated someday,

731
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,219
then the whole Qiyuan continent will be in chaos.

732
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,179
It's getting late.

733
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:35,650
What about

734
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,620
I ask someone to send you home to rest?

735
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,219
i'll send Qingqing back home.

736
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,219
What's wrong?

737
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:45,500
Did you get hurt?

738
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,780
I seem to have got some internal injuries.

739
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:50,810
Your Highness,

740
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,300
it'd be better that

741
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,260
we send Lord Jin back home together.

742
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,170
Fine.

743
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,460
Your Highness,

744
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,890
we found some marks at the scene.

745
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,780
Any evidence?

746
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:58,900
Mingyang,

747
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,420
the assassination in hunting ground

748
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,540
is a matter of concern.

749
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,740
I think you should stay

750
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,780
and find out who's behind this.

751
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,540
If the first scene is destroyed,

752
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,700
the evidence will be lost

753
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,740
and the matter will be bound to fizzle out.

754
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:12,980
There is no time to lose,

755
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,780
so you should take charge of it.

756
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,900
Your Highness, you can go ahead.

757
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,460
I'll send Lord Jin back to his home.

758
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,900
Qingqing will send me back, so don't worry about me.

759
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:25,860
Then be careful on your way.

760
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:29,500
Let's go.

761
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,460
Be careful.

762
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:36,020
Whoever set this up had bad intentions.

763
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,260
We must make it clear.

764
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,020
Go. Let's have a check.

765
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:39,820
Yes.

766
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:43,370
[Lord Jin Mansion]

767
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,460
It hurts!

768
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,460
It hurts... It hurts...

769
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,380
Put me on the bed.

770
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:50,940
Lady Qingqing,

771
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,620
what happened to Lord Jin?

772
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,740
He suffered an internal injury at the hunting ground.

773
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,220
Lady Qingqing,

774
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,340
I'm gonna go and find a casual suit for him.

775
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,820
Please wait here for a moment.

776
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,020
Just go.

777
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,060
Qingqing,

778
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,370
I can swear to you,

779
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:16,620
the glacial poison in my body has been cleared!

780
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,340
Don't lie to me.

781
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,540
I won't cheat you!

782
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,980
I didn't feel any pain when you touched me just now.

783
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,220
Doctor Wu is a highly skilled doctor in No Magic Valley.

784
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,420
He had just acquired

785
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,580
a panacea

786
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,980
and then cured my poison.

787
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,300
Qingqing,

788
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,220
all of these are not important.

789
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,700
What counts is that

790
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,820
we can be together forever,

791
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,260
right?

792
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:56,740
My lady.

793
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,130
As you were.

794
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,580
You guys go and get some rest.

795
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:28,100
You scared me, Baihe!

796
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:28,660
My lady,

797
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,220
I see you are blushing.

798
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,370
Did anything good happen after you came back?

799
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:33,500
No.

800
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:35,780
Nothing.

801
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,090
My lady,

802
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,900
why are you laughing?

803
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,300
Nangong's disease has been cured,

804
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,740
so we can get together again!

805
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,220
Is that true, my lady?

806
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,170
You can be with Lord Jin!

807
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,220
I'm so happy for you!

808
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:06,980
Your Highness,

809
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,580
it's time to drink medicinal herbs.

810
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,580
This is made with a prescription from Doctor Wu,

811
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:10,940
so you have to keep drinking!

812
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:11,940
Doctor Wu

813
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,900
can only cure half of my disease.

814
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,380
The other half...

815
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,220
I know. It should relys on Lady Qingqing.

816
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:19,740
Your Highness,

817
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,420
you have lost your magic power.

818
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,300
Could please care more about your safety?

819
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,820
Thanks to Lady Qingqing

820
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,780
who found the problem

821
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:26,900
and changed her horse with you.

822
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,940
Otherwise the result would be unimaginable.

823
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,060
Now I've lost my magic power

824
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,380
and can't protect her.

825
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:37,780
I was a

826
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,300
little worried about it.

827
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,460
But now she has great magic power.

828
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,530
She has the ability to protect herself.

829
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,210
I can put my mind at ease.

830
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,220
She can not only protect herself.

831
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,260
With her magic power now,

832
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,500
she can even protect you.

833
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,660
Even though I have no magic power,

834
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,540
I'm still uninhibited Lord Jin of Qiyuan.

835
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,300
Today was just an accident.

836
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:05,900
This was not an accident.

837
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,580
Even Xiaowu could also see that

838
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,140
this had been prepared

839
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,340
and planned for a long time.

840
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,460
You're right.

841
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,020
It means I've been known

842
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,780
to seal my magic power.

843
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,460
Xiaowu, tell me.

844
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,820
Did you send the letter to Qingqing

845
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,420
by yourself?

846
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,420
I couldn't see Lady Qingqing at all.

847
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,860
The Lu Mansion was heavily guarded,

848
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,220
so I couldn't enter in it.

849
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,060
I asked Fu to send the letter.

850
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,300
The letter that should have been sent to Qingqing

851
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,300
had been stopped halfway.

852
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:40,730
Haven't she received it?

853
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,580
I told him over and over that

854
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,700
he must deliver it to Baihe by himself.

855
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,100
He also promised me.

856
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,460
It could be him.

857
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,780
Lu Hongzhu.

858
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,940
At that time, Lady Qingqing changed her horse with Lord Jin.

859
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:55,300
Crown Prince and Lord Jin also rushed over,

860
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,130
so my task failed.

861
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:58,940
Please punish me, Your Grace.

862
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:01,940
Qi Yi,

863
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,780
you are the servant I value most.

864
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,180
I'm grateful for your cultivation.

865
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,060
Great.

866
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:11,410
Crown and Lord Jin

867
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:14,180
will definitely investigate this issue thoroughly.

868
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,660
What should you do if you're investigated?

869
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,130
I see.

870
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:20,650
I did all of these all by myself.

871
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,300
I will find another chance to implement the plan.

872
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,580
Nangong Yixin is full of tricks.

873
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,420
Don't underestimate his power.

874
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:32,780
Yes.

875
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,970
I got you what you asked for.

876
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,620
I can always trust you.

877
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,490
Just in time.

878
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,380
What are you looking at? Help me arrange it.

879
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:55,700
OK. OK.

880
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,860
You really have an idle mind

881
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:00,980
and still arrange the flowers here.

882
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,250
I'm so worried about

883
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,500
what happened at hunting ground.

884
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:05,740
You are at your leisure!

885
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,860
Think about it.

886
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,300
Why did Crown Prince

887
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,900
kill you to win the game?

888
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,420
Not Crown Prince.

889
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:14,820
Not Crown Prince?

890
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,660
It was Lu Hongzhu.

891
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,740
Lu Hongzhu?

892
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,140
How did you know that?

893
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,890
I wrote an anonymous letter to General Murong

894
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,780
and told him General Han's death was suspicious.

895
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:27,740
He then revealed the thing

896
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,460
to Mingyang.

897
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,980
And later, the case happened at hunting ground.

898
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,060
What does it mean?

899
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:32,980
It means that Lu Hongzhu

900
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,740
had already known the witness is in my house.

901
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,780
He can't stay anymore.

902
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,180
Do you have any evidence?

903
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,260
Crown Prince

904
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,140
is searching for evidence.

905
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,500
It's not convenient for me to stand out.

906
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:44,980
Nnagong,

907
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,940
why do you believe Crown Prince so much?

908
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,860
And also, even if he finds out evidence,

909
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,260
he is so close to Lu Hongzhu,

910
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,260
will he be fair?

911
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:53,380
Mingyang has a good personality.

912
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,020
I believe he will carry out a reasonable judgment.

913
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,620
So, what's your next step

914
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,860
since you decided to do this?

915
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,100
Lu Hongzhu

916
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,220
has forcibly occupied the court for so many years.

917
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,740
This is a good chance to soften his blow.

918
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,220
But now

919
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,700
I can't promise the safety of the witness,

920
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,820
so I want to send him to No Magic Valley secretly.

921
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,260
I already sent Xiaowu to do it.

922
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,550
[Lu Mansion]

923
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:14,340
My lady,

924
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,500
I heard that

925
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,180
the real goal of the case yesterday

926
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,460
was Lord Jin.

927
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,700
There are a lot of rumors out there

928
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,700
and said that

929
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,700
it was planned by Crown Prince.

930
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,300
Nonsense!

931
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,540
Although they had some arguments,

932
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:31,660
Crown Prince could

933
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,900
never kill his brother.

934
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:36,300
People outside don't know what happened

935
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,340
and guess by their imagination.

936
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,620
Damn it!

937
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,410
I heard that Crown Prince

938
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:43,220
is also finding the whereabouts of the assassin.

939
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,580
But a lot of people are saying that

940
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,780
Crown Prince is a thief crying "stop thief".

941
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,300
It was a deliberate act.

942
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:50,540
No.

943
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,060
I must help His Majesty find out the truth

944
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:54,540
and prove his innocence.

945
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,700
My lady,

946
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,620
His Majesty treats you so badly.

947
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,300
Why do you still thinking about him

948
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,500
and help him silently?

949
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:06,820
No matter if he loves me or not,

950
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,660
I can't see him in danger

951
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,300
as an onlooker.
