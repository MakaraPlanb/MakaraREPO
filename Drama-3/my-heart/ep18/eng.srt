[My Heart]

00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,800
[Episode 18]

4
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,070
Your Highness,

5
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,390
Lady Yunxi is here to visit you.

6
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:47,100
Your Highness.

7
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,190
Yunxi.

8
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,670
I heard that there was an assassin in the hunting ground yesterday,

9
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:51,830
so I came to visit you.

10
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,310
Are you all right?

11
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,910
I'm fine.

12
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,750
But my brother almost got hurt.

13
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,430
Have you found any clue, Your Highness?

14
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,390
There is no substantial progress yet.

15
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,229
But now that people have heard about this.

16
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,630
They are under the misconception that I am at odds with my brother,

17
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,710
and that's why I've done this.

18
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,030
You and Lord Jin are so close,

19
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,670
you would never do such a thing.

20
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,270
You don't need to think about it much.

21
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,710
I'm sure the truth

22
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,510
will come out one day.

23
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,150
This is

24
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,620
what I found on the site.

25
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,430
It should be left behind by the assassin during the fight.

26
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,550
These tassels

27
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,910
do not likely come from an ordinary family.

28
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,310
This should belong to some important minister's house in court.

29
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,790
Whose is it?

30
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,380
My Lady.

31
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,070
I heard that an assassin assaulted Lord Jin

32
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,990
at the Crown Prince's hunting ground yesterday.

33
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,550
You have been my father's subordinate for so many years,

34
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,950
please take care of him.

35
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,870
Please don't worry, My Lady.

36
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,829
It is my job

37
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:51,070
to protect His Grace.

38
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,110
I will do my best.

39
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,630
If there's nothing else, I'll leave now.

40
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,390
Is that him?

41
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,310
Yunxi?

42
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,110
Your Highness,

43
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,990
this thing does look familiar to me,

44
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,710
but I can't remember who owns it for now.

45
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,150
Your Highness,

46
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,030
we found out that

47
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,270
there were indeed some guards wearing tassels

48
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,270
around the hunting ground that day.

49
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,150
However, there was no way to check this person,

50
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,030
I wonder if Your Highness wants to check all the ministers' guards.

51
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:29,470
No.

52
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,270
Such a large-scale operation

53
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,550
would only make the assassins realize something,

54
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,910
and would also make the people panic,

55
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,540
so that the assassins could not be caught.

56
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,590
Now there are a lot of discussions in Qiyuan continent.

57
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,390
If we do not find out the truth as soon as possible,

58
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,550
I am worried that the people

59
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,790
will lose their minds.

60
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:51,470
Your Highness,

61
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,790
I may know who it is.

62
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,070
Who is it?

63
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,190
My Lady,

64
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:58,910
there is some good news.

65
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,910
The assassin was found?

66
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,390
No, not really.

67
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,710
But today the Master is not in the Mansion,

68
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,750
Lady Yunxi is also not here.

69
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,630
Is that so?

70
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,070
Great!

71
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,630
I'll go find Nangong.

72
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,029
I don't know how he is recovering now.

73
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,990
Then you need to dress up. My Lady.

74
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,709
Dress up beautifully to meet His Highness.

75
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,190
You have sealed your magic power for Qingqing.

76
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,110
Do you regret it?

77
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,150
No at all.

78
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,870
But Lu Hongzhu is focusing on you now.

79
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,270
And it will become more and more difficult in the future.

80
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,390
How can you protect yourself

81
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:38,870
and Qingqing,

82
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,550
without your magic power?

83
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,110
Qingqing once said,

84
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,430
not everything has to be solved

85
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,590
by magic power.

86
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,310
Although without magic power, I still have a smart brain.

87
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,870
Qingqing's magic power is getting stronger and stronger now.

88
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,830
I am very pleased.

89
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,430
So this is how it looks,

90
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,230
when an unrestrained person like you has such an infatuation.

91
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,870
How dare you say that about me?

92
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,390
Your love for Wanqing

93
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,670
is no less than my love for Qingqing.

94
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,590
I... I won't talk to you anymore.

95
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,190
I'm going to arrange flowers now.

97
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,150

98
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,390
this Nangong Yi Xin go?

[Lord Jin Mansion]

100
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,990
Where have you been?

101
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,670
Going outdoors in such terrible physical condition,

102
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,550
you might get a cold.

103
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,030
Look at you, just like an angry woman.

104
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,510
Don't worry, I've recovered.

105
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,070
Don't be angry.

106
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,430
Smile. Smile.

107
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,510
But I'm really worried about you.

108
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,670
I'm glad that you're worried about me.

109
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,590
But don't keep frowning.

110
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,340
Alright, no more jokes.

111
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,630
Follow me.

112
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:03,670
Qingqing,

113
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,910
you remember this place, right?

114
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,750
Of course.

115
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,870
That day you left with anger,

116
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,390

do you know why

120
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,350

but you never did.

It depends on who you stay with.

146

Stay with me longer if you feel comfortable.

147
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,310
What a great day.

148
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,430
The quiet atmosphere

149
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,590
is perfect for wind blowing and boating.

150
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,030
Yes, it is.

151
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:45,710
But why is this boat not moving?

152
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,790
This is my first time in a row.

153
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,670
Slow down.

154
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,590
It turns out

155
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,470
there are things you can't do.

156
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,310
I've found it.

157
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,230
You'll see.

158
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,540
Once I get the hang of it, I'll be fast.

159
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:10,630
Qingqing,

160
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,310
what are you thinking about?

161
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,110
I was thinking that

162
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,670
it would be nice if time stopped at this moment.

163
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,750
What a peaceful time.

164
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:26,910
Qingqing,

165
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:27,590
I promise you that

166
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,190
I will settle everything as soon as possible,

167
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,270
and then I will never leave you again.

168
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,710
We will go to live a quiet and peaceful life.

169
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,750
I believe you.

170
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,990
But now the Qiyuan continent is very dangerous.

171
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,230
I can't take everything into account.

172
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,190
So promise me

173
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,350
you'll hurry back to your training in Youhuang, okay?

174
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,230
Now my magic power has increased quite a lot,

175
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,350
so I can protect myself,

176
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,180
and even you.

177
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,390
I will never separate from you again.

178
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,350
But I'm worried about you.

179
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:06,070
I know that you and my father have some conflicts.

180
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,830
Although I don't know what your conflicts are.

181
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,940
I don't want you

182
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,230
to keep going on like this.

183
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,430
You are the closest people to me,

184
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,430
so I don't want you

185
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,310
to harbor hatred for each other.

186
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,150
It's just that not everything

187
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,230
is as simple as you think.

188
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:30,750
It's raining.

189
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,350
It's raining heavily.

190
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,110
Your Highness.

191
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,660
Qi Yi,

192
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,430
do you still recognize this?

193
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,070
Why did you assassinate Lord Jin?

194
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,900
You don't want to talk?

195
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:05,990
Lingyu,

196
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,350
prepare the magic whip.

197
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,710
You're not going to say anything?

198
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,510
Whip him!

199
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,230
How dare you assassinate Lord Jin

200
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,270
in the royal place!

201
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,580
Who did you work for?

202
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,790
What was your intention?

203
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,630
Your Highness,

204
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,230
after all, Qi Yi is a member of Lu's Mansion,

205
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,830
so I am also responsible.

206
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,670
Can I talk to him for a second?

207
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,310
Qi Yi,

208
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,270
if you don't explain clearly,

209
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,510
the Empress

210
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,790
will definitely involve all of us in the Lu's Mansion

211
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,830
if she finds out.

212
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,990
Have you forgotten about the fusang fruit?

213
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,630
Who asked you to do this?

214
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,780
Why did you plan the assassination?

215
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,630
I don't believe this was your intention.

216
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,910
It was motivated by love.

217
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,270
Motivated by love?

218
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,030
Who are you in love with?

219
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,790
I love Lady Qingqing.

220
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,630
I don't want Lady Qingqing

221
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,910
to be with Lord Jin.

222
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,590
So I wanted to kill him.

223
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,070
No one instructed me to.

224
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,310
Qi Yi,

225
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,110
what are you talking about?

226
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,630
Do you really think I'm stupid?

227
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,430
You don't want to say the truth, do you?

228
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,670
Lingyu,

229
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:50,830
whip him!

230
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,350
Qi Yi clearly told a lie.

231
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,830
What truth is he hiding?

232
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,260
Did this have something

233
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,390
to do with my father?

234
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:19,450
[Lord Jin Mansion]

235
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,790
Have a seat.

236
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,510
How did you get hurt?

237
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,350
What happened?

238
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,990
I was ordered to send General Han's army

239
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,390
to the No Magic Valley.

240
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,630
When I was passing by a thin strip of sky,

241
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,870
Lu Hongzhu's subordinates suddenly appeared

242
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,550
and robbed General Han's subordinate.

243
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,190
I had something to go out for today,

244
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,430
so I ordered Xiao Wu and a servant

245
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,670
to go to the No Magic Valley to purchase.

246
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,110
After they returned to the Mansion I heard that

247
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,270
Xiao Wu was injured,

248
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,430
and that servant was captured by Lord Lu back to the Lu's Mansion.

249
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,270
That was strange.

250
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,030
Your Grace,

251
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,470
are you dissatisfied with me?

252
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,070
I came here to ask for an explanation.

253
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,390
Your Highness, please don't be angry.

254
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,310
Please.

255
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,430
It is true that

256
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,670
I do not know about it.

257
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,070
But I did catch a rebel today,

258
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,510
and that's the murderer of General Han.

259
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,310
I would like to ask,

260
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,150
how did Xiaowu get together with him?

261
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,310
The murderer?

262
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,710
What evidence do you have?

263
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,110
I do have evidence,

264
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,150
but

265
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,590
it's not convenient to disclose to Your Highness now.

266
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:38,870
Because the relationship between Xiaowu and this person is too close.

267
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,710
Then I would like to meet this murderer.

268
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,590
I don't think that's necessary.

269
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,660
Don't draw fire to yourself.

270
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,390
Your Grace,

271
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,790
His Highness has arrived.

272
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,350
Got it.

273
00:13:58,950 --> 00:13:59,900
Go tell His Highness,

274
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,630
I'll be right there.

275
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,150
Yes, Your Grace.

276
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,270
I urge you to think carefully about

277
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,820
whether you are related to this murderer.

278
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:20,710
Fu,

279
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,390
send Lord Jin off.

280
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:23,550
Yes, Your Grace.

281
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,030
Your Highness, please.

282
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:36,200
[Lu Mansion]

283
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:35,630
Your Grace.

284
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,590
Take the body out and throw it away.

285
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,270
Yes, Your Grace.

286
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,430
Go!

287
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,110
Father.

288
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,190
Father.

289
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,710
The emperor is dead.

290
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:35,830
Father!

291
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,950
The emperor is dead!

292
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,310
Father!

293
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,710
Let me go!

294
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:42,790
Let me go!

295
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,790
The emperor is dead! Father!

296
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,910
Wake up!

297
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,550
Father!

298
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,350
It was you

299
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,310
who killed my father, Lu Hongzhu.

300
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,580
[Changqiu Hall]

301
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:07,670
Your Highness,

302
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:08,990
Lord Lu has arrived.

303
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,670
Greetings to Your Highness.

304
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,390
Father.

305
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,750
I want to know what mistake Qi Yi has made,

306
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,070
let me know

307
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,550
and I will punish him severely.

308
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,230
Explain to me,

309
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:25,990
why Qi Yi would

310
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,150
assassinate my brother in my hunting ground?

311
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,260
Why did Your Highness say that?

312
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,430
This thing belongs to Qi Yi.

313
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,430
Even Yunxi can be righteous

314
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,990
and expose the sinners regardless of personal feelings,

315
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,390
what else do you want to say?

316
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,270
Are you going to

317
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,350
cover up Qi Yi?

318
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:50,990
Report to Your Highness that

319
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,230
I did this alone.

320
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,190
It has nothing to do with His Grace.

321
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,790
Qi Yi,

322
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,830
you just tell the truth.

323
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:00,790
Why would you assassinate Lord Jin?

324
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:02,740
Your Grace,

325
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,230
I have been in love with Lady Qingqing for a long time

326
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:08,099
and recently found out that Lord Jin and Lady Qingqing are very close.

327
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,390
I was jealous,

328
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:12,710
so I did this.

329
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,099
How can you deny it?

330
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,579
Do you think that you can take all the blame

331
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:17,750
on yourself

332
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,470
by saying this?

333
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:21,510
Alright,

334
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,790
if that's the case,

335
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,430
then I'll make it happen for you.

336
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,670
Qi Yi murdered the royal family

337
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,230
and deserved to be executed.

338
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:37,620
Your Highness!

339
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,510
Please be merciful.

340
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,590
Murdering the royal family is a capital crime,

341
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,590
and Qi Yi deserves it.

342
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,270
Your Highness!

343
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,470
Qi Yi just didn't figure out the stakes of the matter.

344
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,430
Although I was the one who turned Qi Yi in,

345
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,070
he grew up with us

346
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,870
after all.

347
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,350
I hope Your Highness

348
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,510
will spare Qi Yi's life

349
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,710
for the sake of our family's loyalty to you.

350
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:03,510
Father,

351
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,350
Qi Yi has been your subordinate for so many years,

352
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,990
you know him best.

353
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,150
He has always listened to you

354
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,510
and has been loyal to our family.

355
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,430
How could he do the thing that would degrade us?

356
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,030
After hearing what Yunxi said,

357
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:19,110
could it be that Lord Lu instructed Qi Yi to do this?

358
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,310
Well,

359
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,350
things have come to this point,

360
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,070
I'll tell you the truth.

361
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,230
That's right,

362
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,310
it was me who instructed Qi Yi to set up an ambush at the hunting ground

363
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,470
to wait for an opportunity to assassinate Lord Jin.

364
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,230
Why did you use such a cruel method

365
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:48,990
to target my brother?

366
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,950
My brother is my closest brother,

367
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,750
and what you did is so cruel to him.

368
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:53,950
Besides,

369
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,950
my brother suffered the accident in my hunting ground.

370
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,030
How do people think of me

371
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:58,870
after you do that?

372
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,550
What do you

373
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,260
want me to do?

374
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:04,790
I did this

375
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,070
for Your Highness.

376
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,870
Your Highness,

377
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,310
You are pure in nature

378
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,070
and treat Lord Jin as your elder brother.

379
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,790
But Lord Jin does not see you as a brother.

380
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,990
He has evil intentions.

381
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,150
My brother and I have always been honest with each other.

382
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,830
Honest?

383
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,430
Does Your Highness know that

384
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,790
Lord Jin has been harboring

385
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,590
the assassin of General Han?

386
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:37,110
We have been unable to find this murderer

387
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,710
because he was hiding in Lord Jin's Mansion.

388
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,670
That's impossible!

389
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,390
He's not that kind of person.

390
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,070
He is not interested in dynastic affairs,

391
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,430
and will not harbor any fugitives.

392
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:46,750
Your Highness,

393
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,750
the face is known and the heart is not known.

394
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,270
Do you

395
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,190
have any evidence?

396
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:54,350
Unfortunately,

397
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,420
the murderer tried to escape to the No Magic Valley today,

398
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,590
and killed himself

399
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:01,630
after my subordinates found him.

400
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:03,670
Your Highness,

401
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,910
do you know why Lord Jin

402
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,070
has been entangled with my daughter?

403
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,470
My brother also adores Qingqing.

404
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:10,790
I know it.

405
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,710
That's not true.

406
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,150
Lord Jin has always been a loose cannon,

407
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,590
how could he make so many sacrifices for my daughter?

408
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,030
He can do this for only one thing,

409
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,950
the magic power stone.

410
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:30,870
It is still too early

411
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,870
to conclude that my brother has evil intentions

412
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:33,940
based on your speculation alone.

413
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,470
I will find out

414
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,470
the truth.

415
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,510
But until then,

416
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,550
I hope you will not

417
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,270
act rashly again.

418
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,030
Yes, Your Highness.

419
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:46,630
It's true

420
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,070
that I have been too hasty in this matter.

421
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,430
But my loyalty to Your Highness...

422
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:51,870
Stop it!

423
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,150
That's it,

424
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:56,590
for now.

425
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:58,870
You all leave now.

426
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,550
But it is urgent to get rid of Lord Jin.

427
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,110
No need to say more.

428
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,390
I'll make my own decision.

429
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,070
Qi Yi.

430
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:28,670
Your Grace,

431
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,430
I have not done my job well,

432
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,150
so Your Grace was humiliated in front of the Crown Prince today.

433
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,630
Please punish me, Your Grace.

434
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,550
Stand up.

435
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,110
Be more careful in the future.

436
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,030
Go take a rest.

437
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,550
Thanks Your Grace.

438
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:48,670
Yunxi,

439
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,860
come with me to the study.

440
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,110
Father, I admit that

441
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,830
I was the one who told the Crown Prince

442
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,110
that the evidence he found on the hunting grounds

443
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,070
was Qi Yi's.

444
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:08,670
Alright,

445
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,670
this matter ends here.

446
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,470
I will not pursue your fault,

447
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,190
on the contrary,

448
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,510
your righteousness and straightforwardness

449
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,830
is what I appreciate.

450
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,110
Thank you, Father.

451
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,430
I will definitely be careful with my words in the future.

452
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,380
I know your affection

453
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,710
for the Crown Prince.

454
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,270
The purpose of everything we do

455
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,790
is actually the same.

456
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,350
It's all for the Crown Prince.

457
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,990
All this is to ensure the Crown Prince

458
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,830
can ascend the throne smoothly.

459
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,750
I just don't understand one thing.

460
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,710
You said that

461
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,150
Lord Jin

462
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,990
was related to the murderer of General Han.

463
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:46,190
But why did Lord Jin want to kill General Han?

464
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:48,830
This thing was obscure,

465
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:52,350
and the Crown Prince regarded Lord Jin as a good brother,

466
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,310
so just now in the hall,

467
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,510
I didn't say that much.

468
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,030
Before the Emperor died,

469
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,670
he left a secret imperial edict.

470
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:00,870
A secret imperial edict?

471
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:01,670
Yep.

472
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,430
But no one knows the contents of the secret imperial edict.

473
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,270
What I have found out is that

474
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:09,070
General Han had access to the secret imperial edict during his lifetime.

475
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,790
And now the secret imperial edict belongs to Lord Jin.

476
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,510
No wonder you are so suspicious of Lord Jin.

477
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,700
Although we don't know

478
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,150
what the imperial edict says,

479
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,790
Lord Jin's possession

480
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,150
of the imperial edict is still a major problem.

481
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,060
If you let him get the magic power stone,

482
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,670
then I'm afraid this throne

483
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,030
will no longer belong to the Crown Prince.

484
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,940
Father, don't worry.

485
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,910
I will do my best to assist you

486
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,750
in helping the Crown Prince keep his throne.

487
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:37,870
You can leave now.

488
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:51,760
[Gentle Breeze & Bright Moon]

489
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:52,270
The hunting ground assassination case has been identified,

490
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,230
and Lord Lu's subordinate, Qi Yi is the murderer.

491
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,590
Qi Yi has no vendetta against me.

492
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,590
Have you found out why?

493
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,590
After being punished with a magic whip,

494
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,070
Qi Yi confessed the truth.

495
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,550
According to him, he had fallen in love with Qingqing,

496
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,390
and when he saw that you were close to her,

497
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:10,820
so he hated you.

498
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,190
This is what led to the hunting ground assassination.

499
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,430
I see.

500
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:16,630
Mingyang,

501
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,590
do you believe his words?

502
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,830
I have my doubts about it,

503
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,550
but the evidence is solid.

504
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,260
I don't think

505
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,110
what he said was a pretext.

506
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,590
Qingqing is so lovely

507
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,470
and Qi Yi has grown up in the Lu's Mansion since he was a child.

508
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,590
So it's understandable that

509
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:37,630
he has feelings for her.

510
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:38,590
Yep.

511
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:40,590
Mingyang,

512
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,150
you've worked hard.

513
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,550
Your magic power is strong.

514
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,990
You have the seventh level of magic power.

515
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,830
No one in the Qiyuan continent can be more powerful than you.

516
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,380
Moreover, you are very good at writing,

517
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,070
but why do you not want to get involved in politics?

518
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,070
If you are interested in the throne,

519
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,510
I am willing to give it up.

520
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,190
I have never been

521
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,470
interested in the throne.

522
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,990
Did you really spend all these years in the No Magic Valley

523
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,870
just for fun?

524
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,110
Have you found out where the magic power stone is?

525
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,990
In the past few years, the Empress and Lu Hongzhu

526
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,550
have been prejudiced against me.

527
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,310
If I look for magic stones in the No Magic Valley,

528
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,470
it is a trouble for me.

529
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:23,590
Mingyang,

530
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,910
Lord Lu has assisted you for so long.

531
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,780
Have you picked up his suspicious habits?

532
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,590
I always act directly,

533
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,470
don't compare me with Lord Lu.

534
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,350
In addition, Lord Lu is my teacher,

535
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:39,910
We should speak and act

536
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,670
with respect to him.

537
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:47,390
Right or wrong, good or bad, you have to feel with your heart,

538
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,470
do not be deceived by others.

539
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,350
Are you saying that I can't tell right from wrong?

540
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:54,910
You're too over.

541
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,630
Looks like it's not a good day for chatting.

542
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,110
Get some rest.

543
00:25:58,910 --> 00:25:59,590
I'm going to leave now.

544
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:10,030
Such a big deal,

545
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:11,750
I can't believe

546
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,070
it ended so easily.

547
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,390
Lu Hongzhu is now simply in control of everything.

548
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,270
Listen to what he said just now,

549
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,220
is it not directed by Lu Hongzhu?

550
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,070
How could the Crown Prince think so?

551
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,580
He was fooled by Lu Hongzhu.

552
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:33,910
My Lady,

553
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,190
you are so worried today.

554
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,790
Is it because you are worried about the Crown Prince?

555
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:39,910
I was worried

556
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:43,150
if Lord Jin was really going to compete with the Prince for the throne.

557
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,770
[Youhuang]

558
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,670
Master, do you know

559
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,230
what magic power will leave a black lotus mark on your palm

560
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,070
after you cast it?

561
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,430
Are you talking about the black lotus mark?

562
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,390
As far as I know,

563
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,430
this magic power

564
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,420
is one of the magic power that

565
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,870
banned by the Qiyuan continent.

566
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,780
With this kind of magic power,

567
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,460
the magic power can be forcibly instilled into the opponent's brain.

568
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,670
In the end, that person will die due to a severe headache.

569
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,430
The most damaging aspect of this magic power is that

570
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:07,430
he can search for memories of those

571
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,510
who have a lower level of magic power than him.

572
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,550
Make people's memory confused.

573
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,190
Yixin,

574
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,590
why are you suddenly interested in this?

575
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:18,790
Master,

576
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,190
do you remember

577
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:22,150
the secret imperial edict I received from General Han's subordinate?

578
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:22,870
Of course.

579
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,470
That day, Lu Hongzhu assassinated General Han.

580
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,350
When General Han's subordinate came out,

581
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,910
he handed over the secret imperial edict and then fainted.

582
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,550
I brought him back to my Mansion for secret treatment,

583
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,310
but just a few days ago

584
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,030
Lu Hongzhu learned of his whereabouts.

585
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,110
So I wanted to send him to the No Magic Valley,

586
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,550
but I didn't expect he would be killed on the way.

587
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,430
I saw his corpse,

588
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,750
and he had this mark on his hand.

589
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,790
Why did Lu Hongzhu

590
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:47,910
want to kill all of them?

591
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,710
Father!

592
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:50,990
Wake up!

593
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,070
I saw my father die

594
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,270
that year,

595
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,310
and he had this mark on his hand.

596
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,350
Was the death of Emperor Nangong caused by Lu Hongzhu?

597
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,270
In fact, I have suspicions about

598
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,230
what Lu Hongzhu did.

599
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,070
But I don't have any evidence to confirm it.

600
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,790
If Lu Hongzhu has searched for the memory

601
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,030
of General Han's subordinate,

602
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,230
then he must have known about the secret imperial edict.

603
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,670
If he had known about this,

604
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,670
he would not have gone easy on you.

605
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:25,670
Yixin,

606
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,590
now danger is coming,

607
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,830
you have to be careful.

608
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:37,830
Qingqing.

609
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:40,510
Qingqing!

610
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,790
Are you going to meet Lord Jin with the cake?

611
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,710
Do you know that Lord Jin is now an enemy

612
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,070
of our Father and our entire family?

613
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,790
He covets the throne

614
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:53,750
and is too ambitious.

615
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,470
You so close contact with him

616
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,110
will harm yourself.

617
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,910
And if it involves our whole family,

618
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,470
you have no way to make up for it.

619
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:01,830
It's okay for you to like the Crown Prince,

620
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,140
but don't think of all those

621
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,230
who are related to his interests

622
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,630
as imaginary enemies.

623
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,340
Nangong is not that kind of person.

624
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,190
He intends to plot a rebellion,

625
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,230
can't you see that?

626
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,110
Or you has already known it,

627
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,710
but just want to pamper him?

628
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,990
In the future, it will be convenient for you to become the Empress.

629
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,230
Don't think of everyone

630
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,430
as so cunning.

631
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:24,950
I just

632
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,630
simply like him,

633
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:27,750
that's all.

634
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:30,430
Well then,

635
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,190
since you have no other ideas,

636
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,390
you should not contact him any more.

637
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,230
That's what father thought.

638
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,310
Does everything father says have to be right?

639
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,750
I only believe in what I see,

640
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:42,790
what I hear,

641
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,510
and what I feel.

642
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,550
Nangong is not the kind of person you are talking about.

643
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,230
You!

644
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,710
Qingqing.

645
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,750
My Lady,

646
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,310
don't be angry

647
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,590
with her.

648
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,350
She has absolutely no regard for your feelings

649
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,830
and no regard for the safety of the family.

650
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,390
She's just selfish

651
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,110
and thinks she's great.

652
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,270
My Lady!

653
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:08,150
My Lady!

654
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,790
You sealed your magic power for Qingqing?

655
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,870
Now Lu Hongzhu has tried to harm you.

656
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:13,750
How can you deal with him

657
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,790
if you don't have any magic power?

658
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:15,790
During this period of time,

659
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,430
you might as well stay here to recuperate.

660
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,390
I will ask someone to find the antidote to the poison.

661
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:20,510
Master,

662
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,390
you don't usually deal with these things.

663
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,790
I can't involve you in this issue.

664
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,110
Don't worry,

665
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,270
I already have a solution for Lu Hongzhu's matter.

666
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,710
There is just one thing that

667
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,830
I really need your help.

668
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:34,910
Is that about Qingqing?

669
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:35,910
That's right.

670
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,310
Now that Lu Hongzhu has known that

671
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,670
the magic power stone is inside Qingqing,

672
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,550
and he tries to get it by all means.

673
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,150
He has already used some bad tactics,

674
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,910
so I am worried that he will do whatever he can to get the stone.

675
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:47,910
Even

676
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,110
sacrificing Qingqing's life.

677
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:51,670
Now the best way is to

678
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:52,710
bring her back to this place

679
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:53,750
and continue to cultivate the magic power.

680
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,310
There have been many infatuated people since ancient times.

681
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,630
It is rare that

682
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,030
you are still thinking about the safety of Qingqing at this time.

683
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:19,040
[Gentle Breeze & Bright Moon]

684
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,190
Your Highness,

685
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:03,750
you are back.

686
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,190
Lord Sikong has been waiting for you for a while.

687
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:05,550
Okay.

688
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,390
Nangong, you're back!

689
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,830
Any news from No Magic Valley?

690
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:09,390
Yes.

691
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,470
In order to kill the Li An Guild Leader,

692
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,230
Lu Hongzhu has already started to kill  people in No Magic Valley.

693
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,030
He also said that

694
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,390
he would do whatever it takes

695
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,110
to find Li An Guild Leader.

696
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,550
It's Lu Hongzhu again.

697
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,190
What's going on?

698
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:26,950
In fact, Lu Hongzhu is the murderer

699
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,910
who killed my father.

700
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:30,950
What?

701
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,070
Didn't Emperor Nangong die of illness?

702
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:33,910
My father died

703
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,310
with a special mark on the wound.

704
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:37,790
I remember that very well.

705
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,630
And the special power used by Lu Hongzhu

706
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,390
is able to create the mark.

707
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,150
Lu Hongzhu is so ambitious

708
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:45,790
and so inhuman.

709
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,580
Lu Hongzhu has always been cautious,

710
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,710
but now he has destroyed the relationship between the Qiyuan continent

711
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,710
and the No Magic Valley,

712
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,230
and is determined to find Li An Guild Leader.

713
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,470
Although obsession can drive people forward,

714
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:00,070
it can also cause them to lose their minds.

715
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,630
So I want to use this incident to

716
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,790
reveal the true face of Lu Hongzhu.

717
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:08,990
But,

718
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,150
have you ever thought about Qingqing?

719
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,830
After all, Lu Hongzhu is her father.

720
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:43,510
Nangong,

721
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:44,750
you're here.

722
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,190
Didn't we agree to

723
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,470
meet here at noon?

724
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,070
The sun is almost down,

725
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,100
why are you so late?

726
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,110
Did something happen to you?

727
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:06,790
Nothing happened.

728
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:07,910
By the way,

729
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,030
Xiaowu said that you like hazelnut cakes.

730
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,670
I made these myself,

731
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:12,350
have a try.

732
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,230
I don't like sweet things.

733
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,630
What's wrong with you today?

734
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,270
You're like a different person.

735
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,710
Let's not see each other for a while,

736
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,620
I have to go to the No Magic Valley to take care of some things.

737
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,870
I'll go with you.

738
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:27,990
I miss

739
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,670
the kids there too.

740
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,630
And Wanqing, Xiaoyi.

741
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:33,390
Don't go to No Magic Valley for a while.

742
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,950
Although your magic power has improved,

743
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,550
but you still have a lot of aspects that need to be refined.

744
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,630
The most important thing for you now

745
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,540
is to follow the master in Youhuang to continue to cultivate.

746
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,190
Then I will go with you to the No Magic Valley first,

747
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,310
and then go find the master.

748
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,310
Why do you have to follow me?

749
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:46,550
If I take you with me,

750
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,590
I can't do anything at all.

751
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,030
What's wrong with you?

752
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,990
Everything I said and did was wrong.

753
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,750
You just don't want to see me, do you?

754
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:55,630
That's right.

755
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,030
That's good that you understand.

756
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:02,950
You're too hurtful.

757
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:06,030
If you don't like these hazelnut cakes,

758
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,989
just think of me as a waste of time.

759
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:17,590
Lady Qingqing is back.

760
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:21,389
What happened to Lady Qingqing?

761
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:25,790
My Lady,

762
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:27,429
didn't you go to meet Lord Jin?

763
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:27,989
Stop it.

764
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:28,949
What happened?

765
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:30,590
Why are you so upset?

766
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,030
Nangong Yixin

767
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:33,350
is really inexplicable today.

768
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:35,550
Not only was he two hours late,

769
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,909
but he was also unusually indifferent to me.

770
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:37,989
My Lady,

771
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:39,110
don't think too much.

772
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:40,590
Maybe Lord Jin

773
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,949
was in some kind of trouble?

774
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,270
He was so gentle to me two days ago,

775
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,510
but today he is so indifferent  to me.

776
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:50,940
Do you think he doesn't like me anymore?

777
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,310
After all, he is so popular,

778
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,910
he may be attracted to others.

779
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,710
Is it really like the storybook?

780
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,030
It is useless to pay sincerely,

781
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,750
once someone's got your heart, it will not be cherished.

782
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:04,430
My Lady,

783
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,310
Lord Jin is not the kind of man

784
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,540
who is amorous.

785
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:10,110
He must have his reasons for doing so.

786
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:11,870
Think carefully,

787
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,710
what did Lord Jin say to you?

788
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,350
Is he suddenly indifferent to me

789
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,790
because he doesn't want me

790
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,510
to go to the No Magic Valley with him?

791
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,230
Last time I went to the No Magic Valley,

792
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,470
my father caught me back

793
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,590
and sent me to the Manghuang forest.

794
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,750
I also dragged him to be punished by the Empress.

795
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,510
Maybe it's because of these.

796
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:31,670
Lord Jin

797
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,510
probably doesn't want you to get into trouble.

798
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:38,150
But what is he going to do in the No Magic Valley?

799
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,110
And he didn't even let me follow him,

800
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:45,790
which is very strange.

801
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,800
[Lord Jin Mansion]

802
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:02,350
Your Highness,

803
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,310
Lady Qingqing is here.

804
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,950
I brought you your favorite red bean cakes.

805
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:16,750
Qingqing knows that

806
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,110
I like hazelnut cakes.

807
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:21,100
Why did she bring in the red bean cakes?

808
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:25,590
Qingqing,

809
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,470
you're not angry anymore?

810
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,630
I am generous.

811
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,990
When did you learn how to make red bean cakes?

812
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,310
I learned from my elder sister.

813
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,710
Didn't you not want to see me

814
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:42,830
and ignore me

815
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:44,350
when you were in the Muxin Garden?

816
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,310
Isn't that just a pissed off remark?

817
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,750
Do you really don't want to see me anymore?

818
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,910
She is not Lu Qingqing,

819
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,310
but Lu Yunxi.

820
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,310
What is the purpose

821
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,340
of her coming here dressed as Qingqing?

822
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,190
I heard from my father that

823
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,030
today General Murong

824
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:09,110
talked something about General Han and his subordinates.

825
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,830
You have such a good relationship with General Murong,

826
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,870
did he tell you anything?

827
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,830
General Murong?

828
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:17,990
That's right!

829
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,310
General Murong told me

830
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,470
not to eat anything I was given,

831
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:23,190
and not to answer

832
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:25,270
these hostile questions.

833
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:27,630
Is that true?

834
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:33,550
By the way,

835
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,150
Sikong Ying brought a lot of fun things

836
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,270
from No Magic Valley.

837
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:37,230
Just in the side room,

838
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,110
I'll go get you some.

839
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,990
Okay.

840
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,880
[Imperial Edict]

841
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:13,820
[I'll pass the throne to my son, Nangong Yixin.]

842
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,390
Unfortunately,

843
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,670
I just arrived at the side room

844
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,030
and found that Xiaowu had locked the door.

845
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,070
I guess he thought there would be burglars.

846
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,070
I'm going to go back home.

847
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:43,150
If father knows I'm out,

848
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,190
he'll reprimand me again.

849
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,150
You're leaving so soon?

850
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,310
Just stay a little longer.

851
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,270
I really have to go.

852
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:49,950
Qingqing,

853
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,310
do you know that why your father

854
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:54,300
tried to prevent us from seeing each other?

855
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:57,910
Why?

856
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:00,670
Because he knows very well that

857
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,710
you and I can't be together.

858
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,510
He's the man who killed my father.

859
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,790
What are you talking about?

860
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,430
How is that possible?

861
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:10,790
My father has a good heart

862
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,580
and he is loyal to the Emperor Nangong.

863
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,590
How could he do such a thing?

864
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,670
Your Highness must have made a mistake.

865
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,030
I wish I was wrong.

866
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,630
But General Han's letter

867
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,230
clearly states that it is your father,

868
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,510
Lu Hongzhu.

869
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,590
He had committed a terrible crime.

870
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:28,470
Your Highness seems to drink a lot

871
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:29,990
and say a lot of nonsense.

872
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,190

At this point,

00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,710
the plan to get rid of Lu Hongzhu can not be delayed.

878
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,270

Why?
