1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,850
Does that feel okay?

2
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:20,019
Yeah, it feels amazing.

3
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,939
<i>I don't think you
understand how much I love Jules.</i>

4
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,833
How about we hit the hay?

5
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,883
What are you... What are you...?

6
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,566
<i>This may be the greatest
thing that has ever happened to me.</i>

7
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,945
<i>It's also the first time
it's happened to me.</i>

8
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,905
Are you sure this feels okay?

9
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,615
Yeah, it's amazing.

10
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,036
<i>The only problem is,
I took so many Narcos,</i>

11
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,205
<i>I literally can't
feel a fuckin' thing.</i>

12
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,542
Is there anything you want me to,
like, do differently?

13
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,378
Nah, nah. It's amazing.

14
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,380
Rue, you keep saying that.

15
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,048
I know, 'cause this is amazing.

16
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:57,427
I've been doing it for, like,
25 straight minutes.

17
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,430
Yeah, and it's amazing.

18
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,932
<i>Wait, did I already
say it was amazing?</i>

19
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,809
<i>I'm so fuckin' high.</i>

20
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:09,397
<i>Don't tell anyone, but she might as well
be going down on my ankle.</i>

21
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,233
Are you, like, close to cumming?

22
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,694
I think so.

23
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:20,158
<i>Please, God... don't ever let
Jules find out what I'm about to do.</i>

24
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,877
Oh, I'm cumming!

25
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,637
- Rue?
- Yeah?

26
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,680
Did you just fake an orgasm?

27
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,016
What?

28
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:51,314
No, no. Are you crazy?

29
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,233
That was amazing.

30
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,450
I feel like Rue is too lazy a person
to fake an orgasm.

31
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,952
I'm telling you, Elly,

32
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,536
there's no way she
makes the sounds

33
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,830
I heard when she actually orgasms.

34
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,792
Like what... sounds?

35
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:16,255
It was like...
it was like...

36
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:29,310
"I'm cummiiing!"

37
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,187
Okay, yeah, yeah.

38
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,272
- It's awful.
- Yeah.

39
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,565
No, it's bad.

40
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:38,194
Maybe she's just
not attracted to me.

41
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:41,990
Or maybe you suck at eating pussy.
That could be it.

42
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,659
Oh, God, that's embarrassing.

43
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:48,204
No. It's cool.
You're new to the game.

44
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:50,665
Yeah, but it makes
me feel like a guy.

45
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,876
- Why?
- 'Cause guys don't know how to eat pussy.

46
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,630
Oh, my god. You want
me to show you, bro?

47
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:02,218
- Bitch, I swear to god.
- All right, so check it out.

48
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:04,721
- Pretend this is your pussy, right?
- What are you... Oh.

49
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,856
Uh-huh, there's that.

50
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,442
And also...

51
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,573
Wow.

52
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,999
See? Just like that.
Here, try me.

53
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,084
- Try mine.
- You sure?

54
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,295
Yeah. No, it's my hand,
not my pussy. It's okay.

55
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:40,298
Go ahead. Do your thing.
Just like I taught you.

56
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,011
Yeah, but then point your tongue.

57
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,564
See? And that's how
you make me cum.

58
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,234
And you taste good.

59
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,709
Rue's outside.

60
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,756
I'm just gonna tuck my
dick in my waistband,

61
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,924
and...

62
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,859
You don't know how
much power you have.

63
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,155
I'm not a good person.

64
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:12,158
I don't like what we're doing.

65
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,254
You seem very much at home here.

66
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,257
Would you like a tour?

67
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:01,976
I feel like you ruined me forever.

68
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,895
Why does it sound romantic
when you say it like that?

69
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,490
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

70
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,754
<i>Why did you love me?</i>

71
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:33,507
- I still love you.
- But why?

72
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:37,303
'Cause you're smart and cruel...
but not really.

73
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,389
- Not really smart?
- Not really cruel.

74
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,979
It's funny you say that,
because it's something that

75
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:50,232
I didn't really realize
until after we broke up.

76
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,994
Did you know that I loved you?

77
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:08,125
I'm not talking about
obsession or fighting or fucking.

78
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,211
I'm talking about love.

79
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,509
Did you feel loved by me?

80
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,516
I don't know.

81
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,396
But you knew
I had feelings for Maddy.

82
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:13,149
But I didn't know you were
gonna get back together with her.

83
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,986
How many times do I have to tell you
that we're not back together?

84
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,530
Right, you just hung out
and talked about love.

85
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,368
Oh, Jesus fuckin' Christ.

86
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,412
If I would've known you
were gonna get back together,

87
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,998
- I wouldn't have done this.
- That's a lie!

88
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,416
It's not a lie.

89
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:34,336
You have this image of yourself
as so fuckin' sweet

90
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,964
and innocent...
but it's bullshit.

91
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,008
If you were a
fuckin' sweet person,

92
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,719
you wouldn't have fucked
your best friend's boyfriend.

93
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,847
You two were broken up.

94
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,475
That is a comfort
to nobody but you.

95
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,854
I can't do this.

96
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,232
What, you wanna go tell Maddy?

97
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:00,446
- Maybe I will.
- You're afraid that I still love Maddy,

98
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:04,158
so you're gonna do
whatever the fuck it takes to destroy that.

99
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,827
This isn't about being a
fuckin' good person, Cassie,

100
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,454
or being a fuckin' good friend.

101
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,373
This is about you
getting what you want.

102
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:17,671
You can fuckin' leave,
or you can get into bed. It's up to you.

103
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,637
You know what you
don't realize, Nate?

104
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,182
Is I don't care what
happens to me.

105
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,893
I don't care how angry Maddy gets.

106
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,312
You two shouldn't be together.
You're toxic.

107
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,439
- How would you know?
- Because she's my best friend,

108
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,483
and I'm in a
relationship with you.

109
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,527
She's not good for you,
you're not good for her,

110
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,904
and I will do everything
I can to prevent it.

111
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,534
Maddy, that's
literally fucking insane.

112
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,410
- Madd-- Cassie, I s--
- See?!

113
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,038
- This is what I'm talking about!
- I said "Maddy" because we're

114
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,666
talking about how
fucking crazy Maddy is,

115
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,829
- which you can't seem to fuckin' comprehend.
- No, what you don't understand,

116
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,671
Nate, is I am crazier!

117
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:01,131
That's not somethin'
to be fuckin' proud of, Cassie!

118
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:05,636
No... but it is something
you should be scared of.

119
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,930
What the fuck? What the fuck?

120
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:11,600
You can't fucking blackmail me
into a relationship with you.

121
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,769
Blackmail means
you don't have choices.

122
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:16,021
But in reality,
you do have choices.

123
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,399
You just have to own up to
the consequences of them!

124
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:21,902
That is the literal fucking
definition of blackmail!

125
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,738
- If you don't do this, I'm gonna do that...
- Fine, it's blackmail!

126
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,699
I don't care!
It doesn't change anything!

127
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:30,119
- It's fucked up!
- You know what's fucked up, Nate?

128
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,870
You telling me that you love me,

129
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:36,041
and then going and being in a
relationship with my best friend!

130
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,419
What the fuck?!

131
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:41,213
What the fuck is wrong with you?!

132
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,383
What the fuck is wrong with you?!

133
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,678
Okay.

134
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:49,722
Bye.

135
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,269
For fuckin'... C--

136
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,233
Cassie, stop.

137
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,194
I love you.

138
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,332
Did you lose weight?

139
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,667
Do I look different?

140
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:24,798
- Do I look different?
- I was just wondering.

141
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:29,136
- Then why would you ask?
- I was just curious.

142
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:32,890
- Why are you so judgmental?
- Why are you so judgmental?

143
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,516
I wasn't judging you.

144
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,020
You sit on your bed all day
just waiting to criticize me.

145
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,855
That's not true.

146
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:41,356
Did you lose weight?
Are you depressed?

147
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,692
- Why haven't you cleaned your room?
- Do you ever think about Dad?

148
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,486
- What happened with McKay?
- Where were you last night?

149
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,987
Just shut the
fuck up, Grace!

150
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,697
Shut the fuck up, Lexi!

151
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,117
Fine, I'll stop caring.

152
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,829
You're making me
feel like I'm going crazy.

153
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:01,001
Like I'm... actually fucking crazy.

154
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:08,550
Okay, well, thank you. Next.

155
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,095
Any of you snitches
to your parents about this,

156
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,139
your days at the Howard House
are finito burrito.

157
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,309
Never that...

158
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,729
To my beautiful girls.

159
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,363
What, what?

160
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,534
- Where's Mom?
- Asleep.

161
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,453
Not a care in the world.

162
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:41,208
I would like to make a toast.

163
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,420
To Nathaniel.

164
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,882
The winner of all winners...

165
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,385
the king of all kings,

166
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:58,308
the big swingin' dick,
Mr. Big Balls, huh?

167
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:04,857
You are a part of me
I will never understand.

168
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:09,236
But I take full responsibility.

169
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:14,158
I think I'm gonna go for a drive.

170
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,215
Fuckin' A.

171
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,919
Wear a seatbelt.

172
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,338
"Okay, Dad."

173
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,353
I gotta go to the bathroom.

174
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,111
I think she has a crush on you.

175
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,324
Should we all just fuck?

176
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,266
I also... have to use the restroom.

177
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,111
That was not 10 seconds.

178
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:17,406
- Is that a dare?
- Maybe.

179
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,033
We should make her jealous.

180
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:24,371
- Start the clock.
- Okay... One, two, oh, three,

181
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:29,877
four, five, six, wow,
seven, eight, nine, ten.

182
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,588
Yep, thank you. Wow, cool.

183
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:37,384
- That was amazing.
- O-kay, Rue.

184
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:40,804
Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you, are you jealous?

185
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:44,766
No, no. I don't get jealous.

186
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,227
- Hey, Elliot.
- Yeah.

187
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,771
- Truth or dare?
- Dare.

188
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:54,693
I dare you to lick from here...

189
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:58,113
to here.

190
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,493
Wow, your girlfriend is sexy.

191
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,507
Jealous, Rue?

192
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,722
Now, that... was fucking amazing.

193
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,518
You know, I think if
you guys are gonna keep up

194
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,104
with these lesbian power games...

195
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,232
we should steal some liquor.

196
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,743
Oh, I fuckin' love this song.

197
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,124
Whoo, bitches!

198
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,110
C'mon, let's dance.

199
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,112
What's wrong?

200
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,657
C'mon... c'mon.

201
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,709
Do you think Nate's
still coming over?

202
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,252
Yeah, that's
what Maddy says.

203
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,427
<i>What's wrong?</i>

204
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:48,390
I, like... can't fucking stand Ethan.

205
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,851
- I was wondering.
- I don't know. He's, like, sweet,

206
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:53,437
and, like, something good
finally happens,

207
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,857
and I'm, like,
a million times more miserable.

208
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,526
Well, there's a difference between
what you think you should want,

209
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,194
and what you actually want.

210
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:04,531
- How do I know what I want?
- You don't.

211
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,908
Then, what's the whole world
always talkin' about?

212
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,327
People are retarded.

213
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,080
No, seriously, people
are fucking retarded.

214
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,623
Maddy, I don't think
you can say that word.

215
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,709
This shit is hard and confusing.

216
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,461
The last thing you
need is to feel worse

217
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:20,422
because you're not feeling
something you're supposed to feel.

218
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,758
You do what feels good to you.

219
00:22:24,342 --> 00:22:27,929
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

220
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,639
You know what would feel good?

221
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:32,601
- What?
- Dancing with me on my birthday.

222
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,978
- Okay.
- Come on.

223
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,904
All right, I'm gonna
distract the clerk,

224
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,989
you're gonna steal the beer...

225
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,366
- and you do nothing. Cool?
- Word.

226
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,410
- All right, break.
- Cool.

227
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,462
Oh, my god! Kramer!

228
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,297
Comedian, okay, thank you.

229
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,466
Didn't you get
canceled for saying, like,

230
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,842
the N-word a bunch of times?

231
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,385
- You know what, man?
- Now you work at

232
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,554
- a convenience store?
- What's up, bro?

233
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,182
Twitter is fucked up.
I've always said that.

234
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:15,102
And they're always
takin' shit too far.

235
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,813
- You know what I mean? What're you gonna do?
- Hey!

236
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:18,896
Hey.

237
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,110
Kramer, Kramer!

238
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:26,029
- How much is all this anyway?
- Fuckin' motherfucker!

239
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,242
Motherfuckers!
Get out of my store!

240
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:34,996
Don't come back!

241
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:40,252
- Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
- Go, Elliot, let's go!

242
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,796
Go, go, go! Oh, my--

243
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:45,841
- Oh, my god! Go!
- Oh, my god! Jesus Christ!

244
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,008
Rue!

245
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,765
- Hi.
- Is Maddy here?

246
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,060
Yeah.

247
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,364
Come on.

248
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:38,912
Come on, baby!

249
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:03,478
You know, you can't drink on that shit.
It's fuckin' dangerous.

250
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:06,314
- It's fine.
- Oh, my god.

251
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,923
How are you feeling?

252
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,134
I feel fine.
Do I not look fine?

253
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:45,395
Come on, motherfucker!

254
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,147
Fuck you, pal!

255
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,607
Oh, shit!

256
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:53,194
Oh, my god!

257
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,031
Yo, could you put
the fuckin' drink down?

258
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,617
- Are you fuckin' drinking?
- Yeah.

259
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:03,079
- It's just one drink.
- I don't care. Why are you drinking?

260
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:08,043
I'm not even
into alcohol like that.

261
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:11,046
- Then why are you drinking it?
- You know, f--

262
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,214
- Elliot, just take me the fuck home, please.
- Wait...

263
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:14,757
- Rue...
- Nah, I just... I wanna go home.

264
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,010
No, Rue, I'm, I'm just saying,
like, don't drink.

265
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,887
No, I wanna go home.

266
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,056
- Why? Why?
- Just drop me off.

267
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,932
- Drop me off, please.
- Why?

268
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,727
Because I can't fuckin' stand you.

269
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:29,521
What?

270
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,358
Yeah, I don't wanna fuckin'...

271
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,068
I don't wanna
argue about this shit.

272
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,277
I don't wanna fight.

273
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,779
I'm sick of fuckin' fighting.

274
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:38,414
I just would rather be home.

275
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:51,544
You did good, big fella.

276
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,214
Hey, I'm gonna head out,
but happy birthday.

277
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,716
- Why? Don't go.
- Well, I just thought I'd give you guys

278
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,969
- a little bit of girl time.
- That's so sweet.

279
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,679
Nah, you should stay.

280
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:14,192
Wow, that was certainly a choice.

281
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,702
What are you doing, Cassie?

282
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,946
Waiting for the hot tub to get hot.

283
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,425
Whiskey.

284
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,554
Hey, can I have a cigarette?

285
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,639
Thank you.
Can I borrow your light?

286
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,517
I'm Cal.

287
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,406
I haven't been here in 25 years.

288
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:45,742
Hi.

289
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:58,434
I thought I lost you.

290
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,627
She always like this?

291
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:29,090
No, but when she drinks,
it's just tragic.

292
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,550
Just, just drop me off.

293
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:33,428
Can you just, just pull,
just pull the fuck over,

294
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:36,764
and just let me out, please.

295
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,350
- Right here, Rue?
- Yep.

296
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,562
Just fuckin' right up here.

297
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,179
Alright.

298
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,056
Fuck!

299
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,069
Can I take a shower?

300
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,240
Yeah.

301
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,877
Get in the hot tub with us.

302
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,046
I don't...

303
00:35:32,129 --> 00:35:34,215
I don't, I don't
really feel like it.

304
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,592
It's my birthday, come on.

305
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,811
- This feels so good.
- I know.

306
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,355
Can I borrow a shirt?

307
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,945
Hi.

308
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,774
- Hi.
- Are you, are you okay?

309
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,361
- It's okay.
- Oh, shit.

310
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,612
Yeah, it's okay.

311
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:05,825
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

312
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:09,120
I'm so glad you guys
are back together. Yeah!

313
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,956
- We're not back together.
- You're not?

314
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,083
No.

315
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:17,712
I mean, I was gonna say no,
but why are you saying no?

316
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,006
- Because we're not.
- I know,

317
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,674
but why do you sound
so definitive about it?

318
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,968
- I wasn't being definitive.
- It sounded like it.

319
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:25,260
No, I mean, she
just asked a question...

320
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:26,553
That you didn't have to answer.

321
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,264
- Oh, okay, yeah.
- But you did.

322
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,140
I don't understand
what we're arguing about.

323
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,809
You and your tone.

324
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,021
But we're not back together.

325
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,610
Yet.

326
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,779
I mean, why don't just say,
"We're working it out."

327
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,906
You literally just
said you were gonna say no.

328
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,658
- Right, but that's me.
- Meaning what?

329
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,952
Meaning that when I say it,
it means something totally different

330
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,204
- than when you say it.
- Okay.

331
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,873
It might seem that way in your head,
Maddy, but it's the same word.

332
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,959
Yeah, but it's also the speed
with which you said no.

333
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,877
- Gimme a fuckin' break.
- It was quick.

334
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,546
- It wasn't, no.
- It was like a reflex.

335
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,297
- It wasn't like a reflex at all.
- It was like a reflex.

336
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:04,466
- It was like his natural instinct, right?
- It wasn't.

337
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:05,926
- It was hasty.
- You see?

338
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,594
You really think she's
gonna disagree with you?

339
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,430
If I disagreed with her,
then I would.

340
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,265
Okay.

341
00:39:11,348 --> 00:39:13,017
What, you don't think
I have a mind of my own?

342
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,728
- No, I'm sure you do.
- He's such a cunt!

343
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,229
What the fuck is your problem?

344
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,356
You see, I'm not crazy, right?

345
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,233
Because he's always
tryin' to gaslight me.

346
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,985
Look, I don't
wanna argue about this.

347
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,361
You see, this is why
I don't believe you

348
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:25,946
when you make
all these promises,

349
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,240
and you're like,
"Oh, let's get back together.

350
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:31,243
"You're the only person
in the world I care about.

351
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:35,164
"You're a goddess, and it's my fault
for not treating you like a goddess.

352
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:37,792
"I promise, Maddy.
I'll change. I'll grow.

353
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,669
"I'll be better.
I don't deserve you.

354
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,046
"But I love you.

355
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,381
"Please, when I go to college,
move with me.

356
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:47,134
"Marry me. Have my babies."

357
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,104
I'm so sorry!

358
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,147
I'm so sorry, Maddy!

359
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,357
I'm sorry, Maddy.

360
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,611
I'm sorry, Maddy.

361
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:06,774
- I'm so sorry.
- It's fine.

362
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,864
It's not fine.
I ruined everything, Maddy.

363
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,616
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

364
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,076
- It's not fine.
- It's fine.

365
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,411
- You're my best friend, and I'm sorry.
- What's going on?

366
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,954
Sweetie, it's okay.
Oh, god. You threw up.

367
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:18,040
- Just... get outta the tub.
- I'm so sorry,

368
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,626
Maddy. I didn't...

369
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:23,003
Maddy, you're my best friend.

370
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,630
Just get out!

371
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:26,590
- Oh, my god.
- What happened?!

372
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,134
Cassie threw up on all of us.

373
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:30,594
Can somebody help me, please?!

374
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,680
- I'm sorry, Maddy.
- Use the bathroom!

375
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,849
Nate, get me a fucking towel!

376
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,892
Maddy, I'm sorry!

377
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,343
Are you crying?

378
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:18,642
- You wanna wrestle?
- No.

379
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,352
- No, no, no. Hey.
- I'm gonna getcha.

380
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:23,189
- No, I'm good. Stop. Come on, man.
- See?

381
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:27,026
- And I'm gonna getcha. I'm gonna getcha.
- No, I'm good. I'm good.

382
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:30,321
What the fuck?!

383
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:35,951
All right, man. That's enough.

384
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,412
- What, you wanna wrestle, too?
- Come on, man.

385
00:41:38,495 --> 00:41:41,749
- Put your shirt back on.
- I was state champion, man.

386
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,709
- Hey, Mr. Clean!
- Come on!

387
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,628
Oh, Jesus,
you three wanna wrestle?

388
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:48,172
- You think you can take me?
- Your dance, cowboy.

389
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:49,715
- You think you can take me?
- Out!

390
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,217
You think you can take me?

391
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,802
Let's do this.
Let's do this, big boy.

392
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,971
Oh, shit.

393
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:05,314
Yes! Now, it's a party!

394
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:08,150
Fuckin' out of here.

395
00:42:09,534 --> 00:42:10,861
What?

396
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,238
I was just havin' fun, man.

397
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,406
No, man. I warned you,
like, 10 fuckin' times

398
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,201
not to wrestle anybody.
You didn't fuckin' listen.

399
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,953
You're never stepping
foot in here again.

400
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,579
Hey, hey...

401
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,749
You can't do that to me, man!

402
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:28,796
Hey, hey! You can't
fuckin' kick me out, man!

403
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,006
You can't do this to me, man!

404
00:42:32,207 --> 00:42:33,277
Hey!

405
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:38,013
I haven't been here in, like, 20 years!

406
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,353
I have good memories here, man.

407
00:42:46,563 --> 00:42:49,316
You can't tell me
I can't come back in!

408
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,029
Fuck. Okay, all right.

409
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,368
All right.

410
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:02,704
Okay.

411
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,315
Fuck off!

412
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:37,698
<i>Juliet, please, please!</i>

413
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,283
<i>You're next! We're in danger!</i>

414
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:41,785
<i>Please, listen to me!
Something terrible!</i>

415
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:45,205
- This movie is so real.
- Word.

416
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,797
Yo, who the fuck is that?

417
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,383
Yo!

418
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,760
Yo.

419
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:01,055
- What's up, man?
- Hey, man. I really gotta talk to you.

420
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:07,353
Is everything good, bro?

421
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,981
Nah, man.

422
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:14,360
Nelson's baby mama
showed up

423
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:16,528
asking all types of
stupid-ass questions.

424
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:21,992
Fuuuck.

425
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:53,315
Hey... are you okay?

426
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,290
Hold on.

427
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:17,339
- Hey, hold on.
- I don't want to talk about it.

428
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:23,929
I... really have to
tell you somethin'.

429
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,146
Okay...

430
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:34,523
I lied to you.

431
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,318
Rue's not sober.

432
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:44,283
She hasn't been since I met her.

433
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:50,289
She's been doing everything
from heroin to fentanyl to benzos.

434
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:53,292
And I know that because
I've been doing it with her.

435
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:57,921
And I'm so sorry.

436
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,384
I just didn't wanna
keep lyin' to you.

437
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:24,318
I'm sorry I let you down.

438
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,778
Why?

439
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,366
'Cause I'm not a good person.

440
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,910
That's not true.

441
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:47,841
Yeah, but you don't
really know me anymore.

442
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:53,180
Yes... I do.
I'm always with you.

443
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,648
I miss you so much.

444
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,070
<i>I just miss you so much, Dad.</i>

445
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:31,111
What are you doing?

446
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:33,280
Are you peeing?

447
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:36,408
Okay, Cal, what is wrong with you?

448
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:41,455
I think I'm lonely.

449
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:45,709
- What?
- I think I'm lonely.

450
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:48,462
Okay, look, could you
please put your penis away?

451
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,589
- No.
- Cal, I'm not gonna ask you again.

452
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:53,133
- Put your penis away.
- I am who I am.

453
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,301
Oh, fuck.

454
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:55,584
- Mom, what's goin' on?
- Okay.

455
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:56,886
- Cal, put your dick away.
- Yo, Dad,

456
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:58,638
- what the fuck are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

457
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,349
I was just...

458
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:06,521
I was just telling your mother
that I think I'm very lonely.

459
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:08,940
Okay, but, like, can you
put your fucking dick away?

460
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:13,445
Okay, Cal, Cal, this is not funny.

461
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:15,238
What's goin' on?

462
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,699
Dad's standing in the
foyer with his dick out.

463
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:20,535
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I don't know.

464
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:23,580
You know what you
three assholes are lookin' at?

465
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:27,334
The man with no name.

466
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,836
What, what the fuck
are you even saying?

467
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,797
Yo, what the fuck
is going on, guys?

468
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,173
I'm a rogue.

469
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,550
I march to the beat
of my own drum.

470
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:38,303
You guys should've
seen me tonight.

471
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:41,388
I don't know if you
would've been proud, but...

472
00:51:42,072 --> 00:51:43,975
ya might've been impressed.

473
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:46,728
Cal, listen to me.
I think you need to see a doctor.

474
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,688
All right? You're not you.

475
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:52,442
No, Marsha.
That's where you're wrong.

476
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:56,154
- I am 100% me.
- Okay, you're scaring me now.

477
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,490
You know why? 'Cause I'm a man.

478
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:00,408
I'm an animal.

479
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,786
I'm a motherfuckin' Rottweiler.

480
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,831
You know how many
men I've fucked?

481
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:08,834
- What?!
- Cal, stop it.

482
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,335
- Aaron...
- Cal, please. Please stop.

483
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,838
Do you know how
many men I've fucked?

484
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:15,257
Dad, why are you saying this?

485
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,384
- Guess.
- I don't understand.

486
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:18,593
Like, what the fuck
is going on?

487
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:22,264
I had sex with a man
for the first time...

488
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:26,226
when you... were in your mama's belly.

489
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:28,812
Dad, why the fuck
are you saying these things?

490
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,856
Like, have you lost
your fucking mind?

491
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:34,234
You're talking about fucking men
in front of Mom when I was, what?

492
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,111
Like, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

493
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,612
Who the fuck are you?

494
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,948
Here's the funny thing...

495
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:42,325
if I said tonight that...

496
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,786
I went to the strip club,
and I...

497
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:50,542
Picked up a real
grade-A piece of ass...

498
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:54,629
huge tits, shaved pussy...

499
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:57,382
and I fucked the shit
outta her in my truck...

500
00:52:57,465 --> 00:53:01,428
you wouldn't be one-tenth as
appalled as you are right now.

501
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:05,265
You wouldn't be standin' here saying,
"Dad, what are you talkin' about?"

502
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:09,060
You'd be like,
"Dad, don't say that in front of Mom."

503
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:12,939
Fuck you...
Fuck you.

504
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,317
You're a bunch of
fuckin' hypocrites.

505
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:17,360
I'm a man.

506
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:21,072
I'll fuck whoever I want,
whenever I want.

507
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:24,534
I'll fuck men, I'll fuck women,
I'll fuck transsexuals,

508
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:27,621
and I'll have a mighty fine time doin' it.

509
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,416
I eat what I kill.

510
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,254
I'm goin' to bed.

511
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:41,426
I'm a faggot...
sexist, chaser, pig,

512
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:43,970
fuckin' creep, and I love it.

513
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,890
Living a double life?

514
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:51,770
Not my biggest regret.

515
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:57,442
You are.

516
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:02,238
But let's be honest,
we all live double lives.

517
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:05,075
Don't give me that look, Marsha.

518
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:07,410
You got that shoebox
full of love letters

519
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,621
that camp counselor
used to write you.

520
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:12,374
You saved them.

521
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:14,209
Flirting on Facebook...

522
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:17,504
I get it.

523
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:20,381
It feels good to know that you were
loved by somebody other than just me.

524
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:23,718
I'm not standin' here lookin' at you like,
"How could you?"

525
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,354
I mean, we all have secrets.

526
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:41,820
Aaron?

527
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:49,995
The porn on your fucking computer...
made my jaw drop.

528
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:53,206
Marsha, come back! You saw it.

529
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:55,792
Your mother's the
one who showed me.

530
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:58,628
Don't talk to me about secrets.

531
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,550
Watching eight people
cum on one person's face,

532
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,385
gang-bangs, fucking cum-funnels,

533
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,178
fuckin' pissin' in
people's asses.

534
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:09,097
Jesus fuckin' Christ, man.

535
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:12,350
I got problems,
you got problems.

536
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:16,479
You know, I was kind of uptight
when I met your mother.

537
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:19,566
She was a freak...
and a fuckin' fox.

538
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:23,319
Marsha... you were a fuckin' fox!

539
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,784
Nathaniel...

540
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:32,287
Your whole fuckin' life's a secret.

541
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:35,290
A mystery.

542
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:37,876
Who knows about you?

543
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:42,547
I have lived with you.

544
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,762
I have raised you.

545
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,056
I am your father.

546
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:55,268
I know nothing about you.

547
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:59,564
That's not true.
I know that you're angry.

548
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:02,484
I'm so sorry I fucked you up
with my double life.

549
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:14,370
Okay, maybe, I took mine to the extreme,
I'll admit that, but...

550
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:15,997
I have a problem.

551
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:20,585
But the reason I have a problem
is this family.

552
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:22,462
That's why.

553
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:25,632
I'm not allowed to form
an emotional connection.

554
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:30,345
And I'm an emotional guy.

555
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:34,557
You fuckers backed me into a corner.

556
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,686
But you know what?

557
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,690
I think you've set me free.

558
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:45,610
So...

559
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:48,404
this is farewell.

560
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:52,158
I left you with a little...

561
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:56,496
memory of me here
on the floor of the foyer. You...

562
00:56:56,579 --> 00:57:01,292
two dickwads can draw straws
to see who cleans it up.

563
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,797
I'll see you assholes later.

564
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:50,300
<i>I love you.</i>

565
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,560
<i>I love you.</i>

566
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:05,356
<i>I love you.</i>

567
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:19,329
<i>I've always been with you.</i>

568
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:42,352
<i>From before you were born...
until after you're gone.</i>

569
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:20,283
<i>Since before we ever existed.</i>
