1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

5
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
=Sword Snow Stride=
(Season 1)

6
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,400
=Episode 27=

7
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:37,380
Don't!

8
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,925
Xu Fengnian doesn't deserve to die.

9
00:01:39,675 --> 00:01:41,175
You shouldn't be here.

10
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,820
You know me, don't you?

11
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,625
Your mother was the head
of the 3,000 swordsmen of Chu.

12
00:01:59,025 --> 00:02:00,180
Of course, I've seen you.

13
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,540
Lord of Jing'an used me as a pawn

14
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,460
and sent me to assassinate Xu Fengnian,

15
00:02:03,675 --> 00:02:05,420
but Xu didn't kill me.

16
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,275
He's been really good to Her Grace.

17
00:02:07,275 --> 00:02:08,620
He didn't deceive her.

18
00:02:10,075 --> 00:02:12,000
If they hadn't spoken for you,

19
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,620
you would have been dead.

20
00:02:16,075 --> 00:02:17,340
Your Grace, you're still alive.

21
00:02:18,175 --> 00:02:20,100
It's a blessing for our country.

22
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,860
My father asked Xu Xiao not to kill me.

23
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,750
Because of that,

24
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,780
I'll spare Xu Xiao's life for one time.

25
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,425
If you're that good,

26
00:02:28,425 --> 00:02:30,140
why haven't you ever
been to North Liang these years?

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,600
Avoid the solid and strike the weak.

28
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,500
North Liang is dangerous.
I won't go there recklessly.

29
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,950
But you broke into the palace.

30
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:38,800
North Liang is more dangerous

31
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:41,025
than the palace of Liyang.

32
00:02:41,675 --> 00:02:42,875
Are you afraid of North Liang?

33
00:02:44,325 --> 00:02:46,125
If I had known
Her Grace was in North Liang,

34
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,475
I would have been there early.

35
00:02:47,775 --> 00:02:48,550
Your Grace.

36
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,640
These years,

37
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,820
you've suffered a lot.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,660
I'm fine, actually.

39
00:02:52,975 --> 00:02:55,420
Your Grace,
do you have anything to pack?

40
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:56,400
To pack?

41
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,260
Why should I pack?

42
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,800
I'm taking you back to Chu.

43
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,275
West Chu has long perished.

44
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,700
But we still have the people.

45
00:03:05,325 --> 00:03:07,700
It isn't just you, is it?

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,700
Of course not.

47
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,475
Not just me.

48
00:03:14,175 --> 00:03:15,500
The survivors of Chu

49
00:03:15,825 --> 00:03:17,100
have gathered in Shu.

50
00:03:17,425 --> 00:03:19,140
Shu is in chaos now.

51
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,340
All of the people are your subjects.

52
00:03:21,725 --> 00:03:22,860
They've been in despair.

53
00:03:23,225 --> 00:03:25,700
They look forward to returning home
with Your Grace.

54
00:03:26,575 --> 00:03:27,275
No way!

55
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:28,420
I won't let her go.

56
00:03:28,725 --> 00:03:29,750
I didn't ask you.

57
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,020
She is mine!

58
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,925
Nonsense.

59
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:36,580
Move.

60
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,780
He wanted Jiang Ni and I stopped him.

61
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,820
I'll stop you, too.

62
00:03:42,175 --> 00:03:43,780
No one can stop me

63
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:45,500
if I decide to take her away.

64
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,250
Snakes in Sleeves.

65
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,975
Li Chungang?

66
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,900
I know my name.

67
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,220
You needn't tell me.

68
00:04:05,475 --> 00:04:07,200
Weren't you left at Mansion of Lu?

69
00:04:07,475 --> 00:04:09,850
Did you think I was so gullible?

70
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:10,900
Have you been with me all the time?

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,420
It was patchy at best

72
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,025
when you fought Lu Baijie.

73
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,820
After that,
it was unbearable to witness.

74
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,060
Step aside.

75
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:18,060
I'll talk with you later.

76
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,100
Even Wang Xianzhi

77
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,300
can't stop me today.

78
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,200
You're getting old.

79
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,620
Cut the nonsense!

80
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,380
Chess...

81
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,200
Uncle Chess Master.

82
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,660
Your Grace.

83
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,500
Would you please stop fighting?

84
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,500
I am

85
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,260
at your disposal.

86
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,350
Uncle Chess Master.

87
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,425
Can I stay here?

88
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,900
Your Grace.

89
00:05:39,825 --> 00:05:40,950
If you stay,

90
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,925
you're a maid at best.

91
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,460
Do you think he'll marry a maid?

92
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,620
I don't want to marry him.

93
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,050
Wait a minute.

94
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,750
Since there is no fight,

95
00:05:53,175 --> 00:05:55,050
why don't we go inside

96
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,180
and have a good talk?

97
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,550
All right.

98
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:02,875
Qingniao,

99
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,540
go to tell

100
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,140
Grandpa Wei and Ning Emei

101
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,460
to guard the temple.

102
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,450
Don't let anybody in.

103
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,450
After I die,

104
00:06:21,175 --> 00:06:23,225
Your Highness, please let
the little girl outside the temple go.

105
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,975
Why would you die?

106
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,675
Cao Changqing showed up.

107
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,225
Shu will be in chaos.

108
00:06:29,525 --> 00:06:31,100
I've heard all the big news.

109
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,300
Heaven will not tolerate it
if I don't die.

110
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,700
In fact, you have another choice.

111
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:37,775
If you go to North Liang,

112
00:06:38,225 --> 00:06:39,525
you won't have to die.

113
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,050
If I go, the little girl

114
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,300
will have no one to depend on.

115
00:06:43,575 --> 00:06:45,075
Take her to North Liang.

116
00:06:45,075 --> 00:06:47,340
Her paralyzed grandpa is seriously ill.
He can't travel far.

117
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:49,220
Before he passes away,

118
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,420
I can't leave Yangzhou.

119
00:06:50,925 --> 00:06:51,660
Don't worry.

120
00:06:52,175 --> 00:06:53,300
Stay and take care of her.

121
00:06:54,775 --> 00:06:55,550
Stay?

122
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:00,850
Take it.

123
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,860
Use the money to treat her grandpa.

124
00:07:03,075 --> 00:07:04,225
When he gets better,

125
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:05,925
hire a carriage
and take them to North Liang.

126
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,875
Do you mean

127
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:12,875
I can leave?

128
00:07:13,325 --> 00:07:14,275
There is no fight anymore.

129
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,740
You can't see the fun anyway.

130
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,425
Aren't you afraid I may leak the news?

131
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:21,725
If I want you to work for me,

132
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,700
I must trust you.

133
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,175
Chen Xiliang

134
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,620
is at your disposal.

135
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,260
My Lord, please wait for me.

136
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,050
No matter how long it takes,

137
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,975
I'll wait for you.

138
00:07:48,575 --> 00:07:50,350
Do you think he can work for you?

139
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,525
Yes.

140
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:54,900
Aren't you afraid he'll betray you?

141
00:07:55,825 --> 00:07:57,180
The circumstances of gentry
and those of humble families

142
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,860
are worlds apart in Yangzhou.

143
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,100
His only hope

144
00:08:01,725 --> 00:08:03,175
is to go to North Liang.

145
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,740
If I made a bad decision,

146
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,500
would you still follow me?

147
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,500
(Baoguo Temple)
As long as my grandpa is fine,

148
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,275
(Baoguo Temple)
I'll follow you wherever you go.

149
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,400
That's a deal, then.

150
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,150
When your grandpa gets better,

151
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,740
let's leave Jiangnan.

152
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,450
Where to go?

153
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:20,540
North.

154
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,825
(Memorial to the throne: tax of tea
and other items, 562 taels of silver)

155
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,220
Prime Minister.

156
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,620
There you are.

157
00:08:51,775 --> 00:08:53,175
You asked to see me.

158
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:54,550
How dare I not come?

159
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,300
You're really enjoying this.

160
00:09:04,175 --> 00:09:04,925
Yeah.

161
00:09:07,275 --> 00:09:10,460
I don't like to build a reputation
of honesty and poverty.

162
00:09:11,975 --> 00:09:13,940
I want all the scholars

163
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,980
to envy me.

164
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,340
Thus, it may arise

165
00:09:16,825 --> 00:09:19,140
their ambitions to get promotions.

166
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,575
Don't you agree?

167
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,550
I'm not in a position

168
00:09:28,825 --> 00:09:29,700
to make comments.

169
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,180
I heard Cao Changqing
showed up at Yangzhou.

170
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,300
I heard that, too.

171
00:09:36,675 --> 00:09:37,825
The last time when people saw him,

172
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,900
he seemed to head towards Yangcheng.

173
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,060
Is Xu Fengnian at Yangcheng, too?

174
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,150
We can take advantage of it.

175
00:09:47,975 --> 00:09:49,340
We can spread the news

176
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,075
of North Liang and Cao Changqing...

177
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,660
No.

178
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:55,875
No.

179
00:09:56,325 --> 00:09:57,460
Wait a bit longer.

180
00:09:59,825 --> 00:10:01,550
Don't be anxious.

181
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,920
Let's see

182
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
if Cao Changqing

183
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,070
will meet Xu Fengnian

184
00:10:07,325 --> 00:10:08,445
and

185
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,130
what happens

186
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,815
when they meet.

187
00:10:17,525 --> 00:10:18,275
Yes.

188
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,340
Keep me posted

189
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,780
if there is any news.

190
00:10:28,975 --> 00:10:30,175
Rest assured, Prime Minister.

191
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,725
You can go.

192
00:10:40,325 --> 00:10:42,160
You're really diligent

193
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,025
in handling official business at home.

194
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,650
Bringing the memorials back home

195
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,820
isn't appropriate, actually.

196
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,525
But to manage state affairs,

197
00:10:55,825 --> 00:10:59,000
I can't attend to the trifles.

198
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,580
People who make great achievements
don't stick to small details.

199
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,460
Prime Minister,

200
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,300
you're with high ambitions.

201
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,350
Righteous men of Chu

202
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,780
who are hidden in Shu

203
00:11:35,925 --> 00:11:37,540
have been expecting you for long.

204
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,140
Xu Fengnian is very likely

205
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,260
to be the next lord of North Liang.

206
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,380
The royal court of Liyang

207
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,575
may give him a princess.

208
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:44,925
Although North Liang is strong,

209
00:11:45,075 --> 00:11:47,580
it is subordinated to Liyang.

210
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,060
What does it have to do with Xu Family

211
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,260
whether Jiang Ni leaves or not?

212
00:11:50,925 --> 00:11:51,875
Your Grace,

213
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,275
our people want you

214
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,050
to go with me to Shu.

215
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,700
After we gather our troops,

216
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,530
we can return to West Chu.

217
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,725
Liyang

218
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,000
will have another enemy, then.

219
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
North Liang's position

220
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,200
is more secure that way.

221
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:04,750
Besides,

222
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,580
when you become the queen of Chu,

223
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,675
you'll be a fine match for Xu Fengnian.

224
00:12:09,675 --> 00:12:11,400
I have nothing to do with him.

225
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:12,420
Mr. Cao,

226
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,675
can I say something?

227
00:12:14,475 --> 00:12:15,050
Yeah.

228
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,150
First,

229
00:12:16,475 --> 00:12:17,580
We won't let bandits have their own way

230
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,625
in order to distinguish ourselves.

231
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,300
Second,

232
00:12:19,725 --> 00:12:21,020
we keep the army ready for combat

233
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,325
in order to bring peace to the world.

234
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,200
We've never thought of rebellion

235
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,260
and starting a war again.

236
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:26,900
You're so pedantic and simple.

237
00:12:27,025 --> 00:12:28,220
How can you be the Lord of North Liang?

238
00:12:28,325 --> 00:12:29,860
There are enough big shots
who have little regard

239
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,860
for human life.

240
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,180
I prefer to be a pedantic lord

241
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,000
with a bottom line.

242
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,700
What's your choice, Your Grace?

243
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,925
I've never wanted to be a big shot.

244
00:12:41,925 --> 00:12:43,175
Not a big shot.

245
00:12:44,225 --> 00:12:46,150
You're the last hope of our people.

246
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,900
Can you bear to see them
being hopeless again?

247
00:12:49,225 --> 00:12:50,650
Why must it be me?

248
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,980
Your blood

249
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:53,420
brings you glory

250
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,540
as well as responsibilities.

251
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:55,650
Your Grace,

252
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,220
the royal family has no right
to shirk their responsibilities.

253
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:57,850
Enough!

254
00:13:00,475 --> 00:13:01,260
Don't push her.

255
00:13:01,775 --> 00:13:03,525
If you let Her Grace go with me,

256
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,620
I'll kill Chen Zhibao for you.

257
00:13:05,825 --> 00:13:06,980
Jiang Ni isn't a bargaining chip.

258
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:08,340
No matter what you give me,

259
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,420
I won't trade her for it.

260
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,420
You

261
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,940
want to force her to stay?

262
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,925
It's her fate.

263
00:13:18,675 --> 00:13:19,980
Let her make the choice.

264
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,125
Have you thought about going home?

265
00:13:30,725 --> 00:13:31,860
It's my dream to go home.

266
00:13:33,775 --> 00:13:35,060
Since Chu perished,

267
00:13:36,175 --> 00:13:37,460
we've become

268
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,030
rootless duckweeds

269
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,580
that have nothing to depend on.

270
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,410
We can't find a place to return.

271
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:47,620
We don't know where to go.

272
00:13:50,325 --> 00:13:52,140
If we reunite with the people of Chu,

273
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,150
we're not far from going home.

274
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,500
But, Your Grace,

275
00:13:57,825 --> 00:13:58,860
it's not important.

276
00:14:00,325 --> 00:14:01,180
What?

277
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,500
You have your own life.

278
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,240
You don't owe us anything.

279
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,575
You're not just the princess,

280
00:14:13,525 --> 00:14:14,965
you're also my friend.

281
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:21,300
Your Grace,

282
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,125
I respect your choice.

283
00:14:33,325 --> 00:14:34,260
I'm going with you.

284
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:34,950
Jiang Ni!

285
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,580
In fact, I'm used to being a maid,

286
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,500
reading books to make money.

287
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,540
Spending several copper coins

288
00:14:46,925 --> 00:14:49,565
on some rouge and powder
would make me happy for a long time.

289
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,780
Occasionally, I stole
some cakes and pastries,

290
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,175
and you didn't find out.

291
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,820
Life is simple,

292
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,980
but I like it.

293
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,620
Then stay.

294
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,850
But Uncle Chess Master is right.

295
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,100
I have responsibilities.

296
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,700
Too many people are expecting me.

297
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,260
They're looking forward
to the silver lining in darkness.

298
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,660
I've tasted despair.

299
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,380
I know how important

300
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,100
the silver lining is to them.

301
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,020
I'm Jiang Ni.

302
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,740
I'm your maid,

303
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,820
but I'm also the princess of West Chu,

304
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,700
a royal descendant.

305
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:51,225
Cao Changqing.

306
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,900
Yu Youwei.

307
00:15:54,025 --> 00:15:56,100
Greetings, Your Grace!

308
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,900
I'll give you my first order.

309
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,420
From now on,

310
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,380
you needn't kneel to me.

311
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,550
Your Grace.

312
00:16:13,075 --> 00:16:14,350
We mustn't neglect etiquette.

313
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,940
Uncle Chess Master,

314
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,820
are you going to disobey my orders?

315
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:18,980
I dare not.

316
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,300
Your Grace,

317
00:16:24,175 --> 00:16:25,300
let's set off now.

318
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,220
I'll leave with you,

319
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:27,500
but not now.

320
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:29,220
What do you mean?

321
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,740
Is the next stop after Jiangnan
Mount Longhu?

322
00:16:34,425 --> 00:16:35,060
Yes.

323
00:16:35,175 --> 00:16:37,700
Except for Wudi City,

324
00:16:37,775 --> 00:16:39,500
the most dangerous place on the trip
is Mount Longhu.

325
00:16:40,775 --> 00:16:42,460
I want to go with him first.

326
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,525
After we leave Mount Longhu,

327
00:16:44,525 --> 00:16:46,625
I'll go westward with you.

328
00:16:47,975 --> 00:16:49,975
I'm not doing it for Xu Fengnian.

329
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,740
Xu Family saved my life.

330
00:16:53,175 --> 00:16:54,780
I owed them.

331
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,175
But, Your Grace,

332
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:57,725
we have two problems.

333
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,625
Please speak out.

334
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:00,475
First,

335
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,990
since I've shown up,

336
00:17:02,225 --> 00:17:04,600
you shouldn't travel

337
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,780
with Xu Fengnian openly,

338
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:09,100
otherwise, people will think
North Liang has allied with West Chu.

339
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,900
The emperor of Liyang
won't spare the Xu Family.

340
00:17:12,525 --> 00:17:14,380
Then I'll pretend to leave with you

341
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,300
while going along with him in secret.

342
00:17:16,675 --> 00:17:17,300
Sounds good.

343
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:19,725
Second,

344
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,460
what should Xu Fengnian do?

345
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:24,260
Harboring the princess of West Chu
for so many years,

346
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,860
how does he explain to the royal court?

347
00:17:27,175 --> 00:17:28,220
Don't worry about that.

348
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,740
Over the years,

349
00:17:29,825 --> 00:17:32,020
I've been trying
to assassinate Xu Fengnian.

350
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,580
They can easily figure it out.

351
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,300
Inferring from that,
they'll make the conclusion

352
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,820
that I've been hiding my identity

353
00:17:38,075 --> 00:17:39,460
and trying to take revenge.

354
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:40,800
Your Grace,

355
00:17:41,275 --> 00:17:43,050
you've been trying
to assassinate Xu Fengnian.

356
00:17:44,075 --> 00:17:44,825
Why?

357
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,660
Because...

358
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,580
The life of the princess of Chu
is useful.

359
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,140
Of all people, why did they spare me?

360
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,260
At the crucial moment,

361
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,940
they can trade my life for something.

362
00:17:54,275 --> 00:17:56,900
I thought Xu Xiao would kill me,

363
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,260
so I've been trying to assassinate
Xu Fengnian since I was a child.

364
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,100
Granted that
Xu Xiao harbored evil intent,

365
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,125
what did it have to do with you
killing me?

366
00:18:06,325 --> 00:18:07,700
Are all men fools?

367
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,800
It's obvious.

368
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,180
Jiang Ni knew she would die,

369
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,540
so she kept trying to assassinate you

370
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,060
in order to make you hate her.

371
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,950
She was afraid
if she died in the future,

372
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,225
you might be sad.

373
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,600
That was why you tried

374
00:18:23,175 --> 00:18:24,650
to assassinate me in the first place?

375
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,875
Let's put that aside.

376
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,180
Another question is on my mind.

377
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,650
If Xu Xiao really wanted to kill me,

378
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:38,700
would he let me overhear it?

379
00:18:46,575 --> 00:18:47,800
I don't think so.

380
00:18:47,925 --> 00:18:49,050
I don't, either.

381
00:18:49,425 --> 00:18:50,500
I think Xu Xiao

382
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,180
let me overhear it on purpose.

383
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,500
And,

384
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,250
I tried to assassinate him
again and again.

385
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,060
Did it really escape Xu Xiao's notice?

386
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,625
Why didn't he stop me?

387
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,980
Do you remember your words?

388
00:19:04,325 --> 00:19:07,625
Xu Xiao often says he'll pay any price
to achieve his goals.

389
00:19:08,225 --> 00:19:11,375
I'm afraid you two are the price
this time.

390
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,200
At first,

391
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:17,375
I thought Xu Xiao would give you
to the Lu family.

392
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,060
Now I think about it,

393
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,140
Uncle Chess Master shows up,

394
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,020
if we go with him,

395
00:19:23,225 --> 00:19:24,900
the failed assassinations over the years

396
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,980
happen to clear Xu Family
of suspicion and hidden dangers.

397
00:19:28,475 --> 00:19:29,750
Is it just a coincidence?

398
00:19:30,275 --> 00:19:31,575
Because of you,

399
00:19:31,925 --> 00:19:33,180
he didn't kill me.

400
00:19:33,525 --> 00:19:35,500
Yu Youwei and I play our real role

401
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:36,900
here

402
00:19:37,025 --> 00:19:38,140
instead of Lu Family.

403
00:19:39,025 --> 00:19:39,940
Mr. Cao.

404
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,500
Yeah?

405
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,620
Why did you come to Yangcheng?

406
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,140
I came for Her Grace.

407
00:19:43,325 --> 00:19:44,540
How did you know Jiang Ni was with me?

408
00:19:44,675 --> 00:19:46,820
I didn't know if she was alive,

409
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,350
but I found this.

410
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,100
- Divine Token?
- Divine Token?

411
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:52,780
Yes.

412
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,980
It's the treasure of West Chu.

413
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,380
I found it in the hands of a vendor.

414
00:19:58,175 --> 00:19:59,380
Following the clue,

415
00:19:59,925 --> 00:20:00,900
I came all the way here.

416
00:20:01,275 --> 00:20:02,800
Didn't you have the Divine Token?

417
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,060
Someone borrowed it.

418
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,000
Who?

419
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,175
His Lordship wants to borrow something
from you.

420
00:20:14,025 --> 00:20:15,300
Grandpa Wei told you

421
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,660
that Xu Xiao wanted to borrow
the Divine Token?

422
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,475
Yeah.

423
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:19,780
That's the reason

424
00:20:20,175 --> 00:20:21,580
why Grandpa Wei came with me.

425
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,625
Xu Xiao planned everything.

426
00:20:24,025 --> 00:20:26,125
Today you'll be taken away.

427
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:27,975
The princess of Chu reappears.

428
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,340
Liyang has another formidable enemy.

429
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,775
North Liang's position
will be more secure.

430
00:20:32,175 --> 00:20:34,225
He didn't kick you out
because your services were still needed.

431
00:20:34,475 --> 00:20:37,000
Xu Xiao deliberately allowed Her Grace
to assassinate you,

432
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,420
so that in the future,

433
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,775
the whole world would know

434
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,500
Xu Fengnian resolved not to coexist
with Her Grace.

435
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,980
In that case, the royal court
would be more relieved.

436
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,820
The next lord of North Liang

437
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,100
would be me for sure.

438
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,700
All of these

439
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,420
were planned by Xu Xiao.

440
00:20:52,475 --> 00:20:55,275
He has been scheming it
since I was a child.

441
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,250
Xu Xiao

442
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,050
is a good player.

443
00:21:00,475 --> 00:21:03,000
Aren't you a matchless chess master?

444
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,260
How come you become

445
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,980
someone else's chess piece?

446
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,875
West Chu perished.

447
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,275
My last game

448
00:21:09,575 --> 00:21:10,650
came to a dead end.

449
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,460
Since then,

450
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,325
I've never been a player again.

451
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,025
Now I find Her Grace.

452
00:21:17,475 --> 00:21:18,525
We can start a new game.

453
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,600
I'll challenge the heroes
all over the world.

454
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,275
Your Grace.

455
00:21:31,975 --> 00:21:32,800
It's time to go.

456
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,475
Let's fake

457
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,300
you being taken away by me.

458
00:21:38,725 --> 00:21:41,700
I'll leave after Mount Longhu.

459
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,260
It seems suspicious

460
00:21:43,925 --> 00:21:45,025
if we leave easily.

461
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,750
Come to the point.

462
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,700
I don't feel like guessing riddles.

463
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,100
Now that I've met God of Sword,

464
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,225
how can I miss the chance
of appreciating Snakes in Sleeves?

465
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,275
(Baoguo Temple)

466
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,325
(Baoguo Temple)

467
00:22:16,325 --> 00:22:17,850
Snakes in Sleeves?

468
00:22:19,325 --> 00:22:20,250
They're fighting.

469
00:22:41,275 --> 00:22:42,300
Am I still alive?

470
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:43,740
Where is Cao Changqing?

471
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,725
He recognized

472
00:22:44,725 --> 00:22:46,540
Jiang Ni, the princess of Chu,

473
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,860
and became furious.

474
00:22:47,975 --> 00:22:49,000
Then he

475
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,800
attacked Fengnian.

476
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Fortunately, Mr. Li arrived in time.

477
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,075
He exchanged one move
with Cao Changqing.

478
00:22:54,075 --> 00:22:55,140
Who won?

479
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,820
It ended in a dead heat.

480
00:22:57,225 --> 00:22:59,550
Cao took Jiang Ni and Yu Youwei away.

481
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,325
In order to protect Fengnian,

482
00:23:01,325 --> 00:23:02,460
Mr. Li didn't chase them.

483
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,925
Indeed, she is the princess of Chu.

484
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,780
Unfortunately,
I didn't see them fighting.

485
00:23:12,025 --> 00:23:12,975
Where is Fengnian?

486
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,400
He's in the yard.

487
00:23:43,775 --> 00:23:44,850
Mr. Lu, are you awake?

488
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,150
Did they only exchange one move?

489
00:23:48,425 --> 00:23:49,200
Yes.

490
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:50,925
Only one move.

491
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,900
It's like the immortals

492
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:54,495
coming to earth.

493
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,000
Who would have thought

494
00:23:56,325 --> 00:23:58,475
that a man could have
such terrible power?

495
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,700
Now that you're awake,

496
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,525
do you still want to attack me?

497
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,300
Lu Family never wanted

498
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,860
to break with North Liang.

499
00:24:07,325 --> 00:24:08,220
What happened today,

500
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:09,100
in the end,

501
00:24:10,725 --> 00:24:12,400
is the result of her resentment.

502
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,020
Fix all the blame on her?

503
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,775
There must be someone
that serves as a vent to your anger.

504
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,980
I'm not angry.

505
00:24:17,725 --> 00:24:19,140
She has the right to hate me.

506
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:20,380
It's not a capital offense.

507
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,380
You're merciful.

508
00:24:21,825 --> 00:24:22,820
I admire that.

509
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,675
My sister decides to stay.

510
00:24:25,775 --> 00:24:27,780
If you don't want to break with us,

511
00:24:28,475 --> 00:24:29,460
please be kind to her.

512
00:24:29,725 --> 00:24:30,800
Rest assured.

513
00:24:32,325 --> 00:24:34,000
Let me walk you out.

514
00:24:40,075 --> 00:24:41,300
I'm thinking about something.

515
00:24:42,175 --> 00:24:43,100
What is it?

516
00:24:44,175 --> 00:24:46,580
Grandpa Wei borrowed Divine Token
from Mr. Li,

517
00:24:46,925 --> 00:24:49,060
but there must be another person

518
00:24:49,275 --> 00:24:50,460
who let Cao find it,

519
00:24:50,725 --> 00:24:52,860
provided clues to him

520
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,580
and led him to Baoguo Temple.

521
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,500
Grandpa Wei came to Jiangnan
for the first time.

522
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,850
He doesn't have anyone on hand.

523
00:24:59,175 --> 00:25:00,060
And?

524
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:03,050
When Cao tried to attack me,

525
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,500
you were very calm.

526
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,740
You knew Jiang Ni and Yu Youwei

527
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,860
wouldn't allow him to kill me.

528
00:25:12,825 --> 00:25:14,500
Even if Jiang Ni couldn't stop him,

529
00:25:14,775 --> 00:25:15,740
you knew

530
00:25:15,975 --> 00:25:17,540
that Mr. Li was here.

531
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:20,550
All changes today

532
00:25:21,325 --> 00:25:22,925
were within your expectation.

533
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,525
The whole scheme in Jiangnan

534
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,550
was under your control.

535
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:36,100
I didn't get it all under control.

536
00:25:37,175 --> 00:25:38,740
You being attacked by that woman

537
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,420
was beyond my expectation.

538
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,340
I was scared to death.

539
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,420
You knew Jiang Ni was Xu Xiao's pawn.

540
00:25:44,775 --> 00:25:46,400
He would give her to Cao.

541
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,220
I knew.

542
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:49,140
But you never told me.

543
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,475
Over the years,

544
00:25:54,525 --> 00:25:56,600
I've been watching Jiang Ni and you.

545
00:25:57,875 --> 00:26:00,300
Your second sister and I
left North Liang one after another.

546
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,980
In a way,

547
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,060
it was Jiang Ni
who had accompanied you till today.

548
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,540
Fengnian,

549
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:11,020
trust me.

550
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:12,980
Only in this way

551
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,700
could Jiang Ni and you

552
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,100
have a future.

553
00:26:24,325 --> 00:26:25,050
Zhihu,

554
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,860
you made a real effort
to hide it from me.

555
00:26:33,275 --> 00:26:35,025
Though I'm in poor health,

556
00:26:36,775 --> 00:26:38,200
I'm smart enough.

557
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:41,940
Listen to me.

558
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,600
Just leave.

559
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,225
Don't worry about me.

560
00:26:45,325 --> 00:26:47,060
I'll be better than anyone else.

561
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:48,925
Then,

562
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:51,875
I'll wait for you to take me home.

563
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:08,625
(Baoguo Temple)

564
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:09,780
Grandpa Wei, you've got tricks.

565
00:27:10,025 --> 00:27:11,460
I just followed orders.

566
00:27:11,525 --> 00:27:12,660
Please forgive me.

567
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:19,500
(Baoguo Temple)

568
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:35,600
(Baoguo Temple)

569
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,875
Lady Zhihu.

570
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:50,780
They've gone.

571
00:27:51,175 --> 00:27:52,420
Let's go inside and have a rest.

572
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:55,580
Lady Zhihu!

573
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,500
Lady Zhihu!

574
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,460
Be quiet.

575
00:28:02,075 --> 00:28:03,800
Don't make him worry.

576
00:28:06,675 --> 00:28:08,625
I'm afraid I can't live till we go home.

577
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,475
Uncle, since you've made a scene,

578
00:28:20,475 --> 00:28:22,900
there must be a lot of people
inquiring about the news today.

579
00:28:23,075 --> 00:28:24,660
After tonight,

580
00:28:24,725 --> 00:28:26,460
I'll sneak back to join them.

581
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,220
Have you ever thought that

582
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:29,860
if you were kept around Xu Fengnian

583
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,300
deliberately by Xu Xiao,

584
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,140
could your feelings to each other

585
00:28:34,575 --> 00:28:35,540
be real?

586
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,540
The heart won't tell lies.

587
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,700
Just let me

588
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,700
accompany him to Mount Longhu.

589
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,580
Your Grace,

590
00:28:44,225 --> 00:28:46,380
if Xu Fengnian is in danger,

591
00:28:46,675 --> 00:28:47,775
should I save him or not?

592
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,780
Why not?

593
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:52,100
If I save him,

594
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,300
it's like telling the world

595
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,275
that Xu Family and West Chu
are not enemies.

596
00:28:57,825 --> 00:28:58,860
At that time,

597
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:02,450
there will be no turning back
for Xu Fengnian.

598
00:29:05,725 --> 00:29:07,380
Mr. Cao, you're highly skilled
in martial arts.

599
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,300
You play chess well.

600
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,580
You're very learned.

601
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,100
But you know little

602
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,460
about women.

603
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,220
Why do you say that?

604
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:17,380
It's better if Xu Fengnian
has no way back.

605
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,500
Her Grace can take him

606
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,700
to West Chu, then.

607
00:29:23,275 --> 00:29:24,380
- Uncle Chess Master.
- Yeah?

608
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,540
I want to eat cats.

609
00:29:26,575 --> 00:29:28,250
Why are you so cruel?

610
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,220
Will you talk nonsense again?

611
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,100
I was telling the truth.

612
00:29:32,275 --> 00:29:33,700
Watch your tongue from now on,

613
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:36,140
or your cat may have bad luck.

614
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,340
Can I talk secretly?

615
00:29:38,475 --> 00:29:39,900
You should pray I don't hear it.

616
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,260
Hey, wait for me.

617
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,025
Hey!

618
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,780
I'll go up and have a look.

619
00:30:07,575 --> 00:30:09,375
All right, I know.

620
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:11,140
I won't let anyone assassinate him.

621
00:30:12,225 --> 00:30:14,620
What have I done that I deserve this?

622
00:30:20,175 --> 00:30:21,460
Without Jiang Ni,

623
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,500
His Highness becomes quieter.

624
00:30:33,325 --> 00:30:34,740
Jiang Ni is a maid.

625
00:30:34,825 --> 00:30:36,060
You're a maid, too.

626
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,775
Haven't you thought of replacing her?

627
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,850
His Highness is the next lord
of North Liang,

628
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,620
a powerful man in the world.

629
00:30:58,650 --> 00:30:59,820
To escape the notice of the government,

630
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,600
Jiang Ni won't come back tonight.

631
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:04,525
I know.

632
00:31:05,975 --> 00:31:07,425
Are you really going to let her go?

633
00:31:09,475 --> 00:31:10,980
I can't defeat Cao Changqing.

634
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,200
If you want her to stay,

635
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,625
I'll take care of Elegant Cao.

636
00:31:15,075 --> 00:31:16,625
That girl is with extraordinary
natural endowments.

637
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:17,850
She is suited
for taking over the mantle of me.

638
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:20,940
Then you should go to West Shu
to take the apprentice.

639
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,100
Don't you want her to stay?

640
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,060
I do.

641
00:31:28,275 --> 00:31:30,125
But Jiang Ni is not just my maid.

642
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,300
She has her own way to go.

643
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,380
I can't keep everyone around

644
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,140
and not let them go.

645
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,780
It's not fair to them.

646
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,660
Fool.

647
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,675
Huh?

648
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,125
What a fool!

649
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:46,825
Is it me?

650
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,185
Do you think it's me?

651
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,020
I can't defeat you, anyway.

652
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,620
Say whatever you want.

653
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:56,660
I saw you using Snakes in Sleeves.

654
00:31:57,075 --> 00:31:57,780
Was it okay?

655
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,700
It was a complete mess.

656
00:31:59,825 --> 00:32:01,180
It seems that
I don't have natural endowments.

657
00:32:02,075 --> 00:32:03,500
Why is it Snakes in Sleeves

658
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,620
instead of Dragons in Sleeves?

659
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:06,500
Is there any hidden meaning?

660
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,340
Flying snake turns into a dragon.

661
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,940
Though dragon is noble and dignified,

662
00:32:10,275 --> 00:32:11,660
once a snake turns into a dragon,

663
00:32:11,725 --> 00:32:13,100
it becomes a beast

664
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,740
that serves immortals and gods.

665
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,800
It becomes their mount.

666
00:32:16,175 --> 00:32:18,000
Only the snake
that hasn't turned into a dragon

667
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,580
harbors the ambition
of breaking through all obstacles

668
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,900
and the arrogance

669
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,300
of climbing up and conquering the world

670
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,140
even if it must fight against itself!

671
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,780
Only by remembering
the true meaning of the move

672
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,340
can you master it.

673
00:32:29,525 --> 00:32:30,875
If you give in,

674
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,660
you'll lose the unruliness.

675
00:32:33,225 --> 00:32:34,300
Give in to whom?

676
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,820
To your true heart.

677
00:32:36,325 --> 00:32:37,420
People will be afraid.

678
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,380
They will despair,

679
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,220
fear

680
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,300
or shrink back.

681
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:42,740
All of those torture you from inside

682
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,060
and stop you from moving forward.

683
00:32:44,225 --> 00:32:45,700
The real Snakes in Sleeves

684
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,900
cuts off the knot in your heart.

685
00:32:47,225 --> 00:32:48,940
Only by getting rid of your fear

686
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,275
can you break through all shackles

687
00:32:50,275 --> 00:32:51,770
and go your own way.

688
00:32:52,775 --> 00:32:54,820
Neither the swordplay nor the move
or the meaning is important.

689
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,075
Understanding this

690
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:57,740
helps you to master the move
of Snakes in Sleeves.

691
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,180
(To the Son of Lord of North Liang)
If I want to control a man,

692
00:33:16,225 --> 00:33:17,425
the most important thing

693
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,800
is to disturb his mind.

694
00:33:19,925 --> 00:33:21,180
Wu Su

695
00:33:22,175 --> 00:33:24,780
(Biography of Wu Su)
was Xu Fengnian's beloved mother.

696
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,620
Through the images,

697
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,220
we can affect his moods.

698
00:33:27,675 --> 00:33:29,150
The dragon

699
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,980
will cut off his inner reliance on her.

700
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:32,275
In other words,

701
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,500
I'll let Wu Su

702
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,375
die once again in front of him.

703
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,300
And maybe,

704
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,460
he'll become a lunatic.

705
00:33:39,725 --> 00:33:41,540
A lunatic

706
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,980
becomes the next lord of North Liang.

707
00:33:44,225 --> 00:33:45,580
Isn't it the best result

708
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,420
for the royal family?

709
00:33:58,475 --> 00:34:00,780
I'm going to ask His Highness
to come down and have a rest.

710
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:01,860
General.

711
00:34:02,025 --> 00:34:03,140
We found a box near the camp.

712
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,300
There is a note on it

713
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,515
saying it's dedicated to His Highness.

714
00:34:08,175 --> 00:34:09,180
It's light.

715
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,250
It doesn't look dangerous.

716
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,050
(Biography of Wu Su)

717
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,600
What's wrong?

718
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:25,980
It's about the night

719
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:27,675
when Her Grace
was ambushed in the capital.

720
00:34:27,675 --> 00:34:28,540
I think we haven't found

721
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,375
any clues over the years, right?

722
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:33,140
We must ask His Highness
to see it first.

723
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,340
Guard the camp
and don't let anyone come up close.

724
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,260
Yes.

725
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:41,100
Keep on the alert.

726
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:41,825
Yes!

727
00:34:43,075 --> 00:34:44,180
Don't worry.

728
00:34:44,575 --> 00:34:46,140
There is no poison on that book.

729
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,975
Without tricks or poison,

730
00:34:47,975 --> 00:34:48,900
how can a book

731
00:34:49,075 --> 00:34:50,250
hurt people?

732
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,780
Some of your words I understand

733
00:35:31,525 --> 00:35:32,580
while some I don't.

734
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,580
What don't you understand?

735
00:35:33,775 --> 00:35:35,300
I don't understand

736
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,500
how you cut off the knot in your heart.

737
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:41,000
After all, the move of Snakes in Sleeves
is just sword energy.

738
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,850
How could it
cut off the knot in your heart?

739
00:35:43,325 --> 00:35:45,425
You can't really stab yourself
in the heart, can you?

740
00:35:46,725 --> 00:35:47,725
Back in the day,

741
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,575
I was bothered by the same question
for a long time.

742
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,540
After I invented Snakes in Sleeves,

743
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,550
I was almost unrivaled in the world.

744
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,600
Since then,

745
00:35:55,725 --> 00:35:57,350
I've got the name of God of Sword.

746
00:35:57,725 --> 00:35:58,450
Extraordinary.

747
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,580
But deep down inside,

748
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,340
I was anxious and confused.

749
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,780
I was struggling

750
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,150
to find a way out.

751
00:36:04,325 --> 00:36:05,150
Why?

752
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,260
Because my move

753
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,740
needed unyielding wild snakes.

754
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,740
But humans have the nature
of being slack

755
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,675
and compromising.

756
00:36:11,675 --> 00:36:12,825
One day,

757
00:36:12,825 --> 00:36:14,820
if I lost the unyielding spirit,

758
00:36:15,225 --> 00:36:16,180
my swordplay

759
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:18,100
would come to a dead end.

760
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,800
So I was afraid and lost.

761
00:36:20,975 --> 00:36:22,500
It was like the dead end
had already come to me.

762
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,100
I couldn't escape from it.

763
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,350
I knew the dead end

764
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,400
came from the fear in my heart.

765
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:30,500
Only by breaking the misty barrier
deep down inside me

766
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,225
could I move forward.

767
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,650
Just like you asked me,

768
00:36:35,425 --> 00:36:37,325
I asked myself every day

769
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,175
how I cut off the knot in my heart.

770
00:36:40,425 --> 00:36:41,450
You did it, didn't you?

771
00:36:41,775 --> 00:36:42,540
Yes.

772
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,660
By improving the sword intent
of Snakes in Sleeves

773
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,775
to another level,

774
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:48,925
I invented my real unique move.

775
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:50,580
It's called

776
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,350
Open the Heaven's Gate.

777
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,500
I seemed to see something.

778
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,540
That's because I was influencing you
with the true meaning

779
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,400
of Open the Heaven's Gate.

780
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,340
What you saw

781
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,675
was the secret of the move.

782
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,860
You can show me a vision?

783
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,375
When martial arts develop to perfection,

784
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:24,540
they can influence you
from body to heart.

785
00:38:24,725 --> 00:38:26,900
They can achieve many things

786
00:38:26,925 --> 00:38:28,380
from changing reality
to affecting the spirit.

787
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,260
So

788
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,620
some masters make you fear
and shrink back

789
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,000
only by standing there.

790
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,780
It's because you're overwhelmed

791
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,625
by their spirit.

792
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:36,100
Let's put it aside.

793
00:38:36,525 --> 00:38:38,375
What have you seen just now?

794
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,475
I saw you splitting the sky.

795
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,580
I don't understand.

796
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:47,200
What is heaven's mandate?

797
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,350
Heaven's mandate

798
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:50,000
is natural justice
bestowed by natural law.

799
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,900
What is the way of heaven and man?

800
00:38:53,225 --> 00:38:54,500
A man should respect heaven's mandate.

801
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,380
If a man doesn't respect the heaven,

802
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,580
the deepest disaster
will befall the man,

803
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,460
which is invisible.

804
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,375
That's why

805
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:00,325
the ancients said man must
conform to the way of heaven.

806
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,675
Those who go along with it
have good luck

807
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,935
and those who resist it have ill luck.

808
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:04,660
The way of heaven
covers all living creatures.

809
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,140
Man lives under heaven,

810
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,575
but eagers to be immortal.

811
00:39:07,825 --> 00:39:08,725
Through Heaven's Gate,

812
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,700
man becomes immortal.

813
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,740
Those who pass through the gate

814
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,350
will lord it over all living creatures.

815
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,970
But I refuse to accept it.

816
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:17,380
Accept what?

817
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,020
I refuse to accept
that heaven decides man's life,

818
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:21,150
man can't be the master
of their own fate,

819
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,550
man can't conquer heaven,

820
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:25,440
and immortals overrun all living beings.

821
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:27,180
I'll use my sword

822
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,340
to split Heaven's Gate.

823
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,460
All my life,

824
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,620
I'll be a man who is dedicated

825
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,500
to exploring the way of heaven
but not surrendering to it.

826
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,260
I'll find my own way
without fearing immortals.

827
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,675
Even if all gods and demons
come to earth,

828
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,660
I'll kill them with my sword!

829
00:39:42,925 --> 00:39:43,780
Now, do you understand

830
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,400
what Open the Heaven's Gate is?

831
00:39:48,825 --> 00:39:50,175
Defying fate

832
00:39:50,425 --> 00:39:51,580
and cutting off the shackles,

833
00:39:52,375 --> 00:39:53,650
with unyielding spirit,

834
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,500
I'll get rid of all hesitation

835
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:57,900
and the fear in my heart,

836
00:39:58,975 --> 00:40:00,500
thus, with a clear heart,

837
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:02,175
I'll cross the mortal world.

838
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:03,700
The idea

839
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,200
is the soul of Open the Heaven's Gate.

840
00:40:07,975 --> 00:40:09,850
Did you master the move at that time?

841
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:10,975
I did.

842
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:13,500
How did you lose to Wang Xianzhi, then?

843
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:15,420
During my fight against Wang Xianzhi,

844
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,820
I only used Snakes in Sleeves.

845
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,025
I didn't use Open the Heaven's Gate.

846
00:40:18,025 --> 00:40:18,780
Why?

847
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,775
Wang is a talent.

848
00:40:20,775 --> 00:40:22,500
I didn't want him to die.

849
00:40:23,475 --> 00:40:25,050
So you'd rather lose to him?

850
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,660
I wasn't sure if I could win

851
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,625
without killing him.

852
00:40:30,225 --> 00:40:31,400
I hesitated a little.

853
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:33,620
The moment I hesitated
while fighting Wang Xianzhi,

854
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,660
I lost.

855
00:40:35,175 --> 00:40:36,675
You should have another fight.

856
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,975
I thought so, too.

857
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,435
I wanted to improve my skills.

858
00:40:40,435 --> 00:40:42,300
When I got full control of the move,

859
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,700
I would have another fight
against Wang Xianzhi.

860
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,180
I might probably win him

861
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,125
without killing him.

862
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:47,220
But the fight

863
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,675
has never come true.

864
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,500
Because soon after that,

865
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,425
I lost my life.

866
00:40:53,975 --> 00:40:55,700
My sword intent and battle intent

867
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,550
were all gone.

868
00:40:58,925 --> 00:41:00,575
How did you lose your life?

869
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:02,475
You had mastered Open the Heaven's Gate.

870
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:04,260
People don't get everything

871
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,550
or live a happy life

872
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:07,060
just because they're masters
of martial arts.

873
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:09,620
I killed

874
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,825
the most important person to me

875
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:13,060
with my own hands.

876
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:17,725
From that day on,

877
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:19,900
nothing matters anymore.

878
00:41:20,175 --> 00:41:20,925
You...

879
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,625
No matter what happened,

880
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,180
it was all over.

881
00:41:35,425 --> 00:41:36,275
Your Highness.

882
00:41:36,675 --> 00:41:37,540
Mr. Li.

883
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:39,020
Your Highness.

884
00:41:39,225 --> 00:41:41,325
We found a wooden box near the camp.

885
00:41:41,325 --> 00:41:42,700
Inside is the information

886
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,500
about Her Grace's murder.

887
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,600
Let me see.

888
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:49,000
No matter what you see,

889
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,800
don't forget the sword
that cuts off the knot in your heart.

890
00:41:51,925 --> 00:41:52,550
Yeah.

891
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,000
(Biography of Wu Su)
The sword that cuts off the knot?

892
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,475
Open the Heaven's Gate.

893
00:42:06,575 --> 00:42:07,900
Isn't it

894
00:42:08,175 --> 00:42:10,225
Mr. Li's legendary ultimate sword move?

895
00:42:11,825 --> 00:42:12,775
Did he pass it on to you?

896
00:42:12,775 --> 00:42:13,860
It's not a sword move.

897
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,660
It's the true meaning.

898
00:42:15,525 --> 00:42:16,225
Huh?

899
00:42:20,075 --> 00:42:20,940
True meaning?

900
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,940
Wang Xianzhi was also
in the capital that night.

901
00:42:25,725 --> 00:42:27,300
Is he the murderer of my mother?

902
00:42:27,925 --> 00:42:29,000
The origin of the box

903
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:30,500
is unknown.

904
00:42:30,625 --> 00:42:31,850
It isn't necessarily true.

905
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,740
Do you know what the painting is?

906
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:37,575
(Biography of Wu Su)

907
00:42:37,575 --> 00:42:38,875
It looks like

908
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,450
some doodles.

909
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,360
It doesn't affect reading.

910
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:45,800
Leave it alone.
