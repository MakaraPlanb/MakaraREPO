1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

(Season 1)

00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,400
=Episode 18=

7
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,275
(Solitary Central Plains)

8
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:38,125
(Xiangfan, Qingzhou)

9
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,416
Come and have a look.

10
00:01:42,925 --> 00:01:44,700
(Xiangfan)

11
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,372
Hot steamed stuffed buns.

12
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:48,350
Hot steamed stuffed buns.

13
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,341
Bamboo ware.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,344
Bamboo ware for sale.

15
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:53,825
Sir, buy some.

16
00:01:53,825 --> 00:01:54,475
Umbrellas.

17
00:01:54,475 --> 00:01:55,075
Miss.

18
00:01:55,075 --> 00:01:56,341
Durable umbrellas.

19
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:57,324
Have a look.

20
00:01:57,324 --> 00:01:59,800
(Solitary Central Plains)

21
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,082
Let's go over there.

22
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,150
Good tea.

23
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,775
Delicious rice cake.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,875
Come and have a look.

25
00:02:10,525 --> 00:02:11,325
What's wrong?

26
00:02:11,325 --> 00:02:12,325
Vintage wine.

27
00:02:12,325 --> 00:02:13,159
Nothing.

28
00:02:14,275 --> 00:02:15,325
- The scene evokes your memories?
- Come.

29
00:02:15,325 --> 00:02:16,525
Let's buy some vegetables.

30
00:02:16,525 --> 00:02:18,199
Why can it evoke my memories?

31
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,500
- If I remember correctly,
- See you, sir.

32
00:02:20,575 --> 00:02:22,960
- Xiangfan used to be a big town of Chu.
- Come after you drink it up.

33
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:24,800
- You were the Princess of Chu.
- What's this?

34
00:02:24,925 --> 00:02:26,175
- Now you're revisiting this town.
- Celery.

35
00:02:26,325 --> 00:02:27,075
It looks good.

36
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:27,975
You must be touched.

37
00:02:27,975 --> 00:02:28,639
It's indeed good.

38
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,300
- I'm no longer a princess.
- This is good.

39
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,439
Come and have a look.

40
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,599
Broil it with some salt for dinner.

41
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,080
Now, I'm only a maid.

42
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:36,785
Welcome next time.

43
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,360
I visited this town when I was little.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,719
At that time, people on the street

45
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,275
spoke the accent of Chu.

46
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:50,840
Not the accent is gone,

47
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,159
but people are gone.

48
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,039
Xu Xiao besieged Xiangfan
for three years

49
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,280
with 100 thousand soldiers.

50
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,520
People of Chu vowed to fight
until they died.

51
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,560
Even civilians guarded
the town spontaneously.

52
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:09,350
When the town was broken into,

53
00:03:09,925 --> 00:03:11,240
less than ten thousand people

54
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,360
were still alive

55
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:13,800
when there used to be
200 thousand people in Xiangfan.

56
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,080
Later, people from other towns
migrated to Xiangfan

57
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,719
so that the town prospered again.

58
00:03:20,525 --> 00:03:21,919
Xu Xiao came here after the war.

59
00:03:22,575 --> 00:03:23,439
He said,

60
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,039
hundreds of thousands of ghosts
were buried

61
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,625
behind the bustling streets

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,199
and they wailed mournfully every night.

63
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,719
Why did you say this?

64
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,680
To show off your father's invincibility

65
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,800
in attacking cities?

66
00:03:41,925 --> 00:03:43,479
Xu Xiao didn't say that

67
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,520
to show off.

68
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,039
Why did he say that, then?

69
00:03:47,575 --> 00:03:49,439
Actually, there's no such a thing
as a ghost in the world.

70
00:03:50,525 --> 00:03:52,080
The ghosts he talked about

71
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,680
weren't buried in Xiangfan,

72
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,280
but in his heart.

73
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,680
They've been haunting him forever.

74
00:04:05,975 --> 00:04:07,199
Slayer Xu Xiao.

75
00:04:08,275 --> 00:04:10,080
People only know his prestige.

76
00:04:10,225 --> 00:04:11,400
None of them knows

77
00:04:11,525 --> 00:04:13,675
how many ghosts are there in his heart.

78
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,879
Is he regretting it?

79
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:19,360
No.

80
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:21,800
He's on guard.

81
00:04:22,225 --> 00:04:23,279
He's reminding himself.

82
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,160
He wants to tell himself

83
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,160
that he must stop the wars
to break out again

84
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,720
at whatever cost.

85
00:04:31,325 --> 00:04:33,199
He wants to protect the peaceful world.

86
00:04:34,075 --> 00:04:34,920
So,

87
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,120
North Liang Army matters most to him.

88
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,319
What about you?

89
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,879
I'm different from him.

90
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,329
I won't be like him.

91
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,600
If I can't even protect
important people around me,

92
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,399
what's the point

93
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,360
of the world

94
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,040
or the big plan?

95
00:05:05,975 --> 00:05:06,875
Come and have a look.

96
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:07,720
Childish.

97
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,480
You're childish.

98
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:10,600
You're the most childish.

99
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,800
Who says childish will be childish.

100
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,360
You. Just you!

101
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,175
You're child...

102
00:05:14,175 --> 00:05:15,120
Next,

103
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,240
where are we going?

104
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,439
I know where the henchmen
of our family are hiding.

105
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,560
Let me take you to them.

106
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,360
Don't bother.

107
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,720
Why?

108
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:25,720
What kind of man is Lord of Jing'an?

109
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,399
I'm afraid

110
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,040
he has cleared away the henchmen
of your family.

111
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,839
What are you going to do then?

112
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,725
Where's the best inn in Xiangfan?

113
00:05:35,575 --> 00:05:36,879
Go straight

114
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,250
and turn right after two intersections.

115
00:05:38,325 --> 00:05:39,319
We're going to the inn.

116
00:05:39,475 --> 00:05:40,839
You're going to the Mansion
of Lord of Jing'an.

117
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,120
Why am I going there?

118
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,040
To take revenge?

119
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,279
To take a message.

120
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:51,050
What?

121
00:05:55,175 --> 00:06:00,125
(Xiangfan)

122
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:03,075
(Mansion of Lord of Jing'an)

123
00:06:03,075 --> 00:06:05,525
(Mansion of Lord of Jing'an, Xiangfan)

124
00:06:34,525 --> 00:06:35,319
Father.

125
00:06:42,275 --> 00:06:43,439
Have you realized
what mistake you made?

126
00:06:45,175 --> 00:06:46,680
I didn't expect

127
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,480
that Xu Fengnian got
so many masters around him.

128
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:50,000
That's not the point.

129
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,360
Behind him

130
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,240
is North Liang.

131
00:06:56,425 --> 00:06:57,199
Take your seat.

132
00:07:16,325 --> 00:07:17,600
I know killing Xu Fengnian

133
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,800
is like poking a hornets' nest.

134
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,439
But don't worry, Father.

135
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,160
I've arranged the scapegoat.

136
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,920
Even if I failed,

137
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:27,959
I wouldn't be in trouble.

138
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,650
That's why

139
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:32,319
you killed Commander Wei's son?

140
00:07:32,775 --> 00:07:34,600
Wei Dong complies in appearance
but opposes in the heart.

141
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,319
He's the spy planted in the navy.

142
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,279
When I killed his son
for Xu Fengnian's case,

143
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,439
we can warn him

144
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,759
and frighten the navy.

145
00:07:46,075 --> 00:07:47,839
I've been telling you

146
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,399
to read more Buddhist scriptures

147
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,480
and cultivate yourself.

148
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,600
Why do you always have

149
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,759
such a strong intent to kill?

150
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,040
I've killed his son already.

151
00:08:02,325 --> 00:08:03,500
The court

152
00:08:03,825 --> 00:08:06,160
always thinks highly

153
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,800
of North Liang.

154
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,920
The legal son of the Lin family
assassinated Xu Fengnian.

155
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:14,279
How did they end up?

156
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,120
They were exterminated.

157
00:08:19,475 --> 00:08:20,800
You think

158
00:08:21,475 --> 00:08:23,975
the case can be over

159
00:08:24,725 --> 00:08:26,800
when Wei Dong's son is dead?

160
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,560
What do you think I should do?

161
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,279
Wei Dong

162
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,799
has only one son.

163
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,480
He always cares for his son.

164
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,200
His son died before him.

165
00:08:39,675 --> 00:08:41,200
How miserable!

166
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,360
Why not

167
00:08:44,975 --> 00:08:47,159
let them die all together

168
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,550
so that they can

169
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,960
take care of each other in heaven?

170
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,080
You're saying...?

171
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,100
So far,

172
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:57,720
Wei Dong's family has been dead

173
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,799
with his son.

174
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,519
You've killed all his family?

175
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,039
Only in this way

176
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,440
can we

177
00:09:09,075 --> 00:09:11,039
close the case.

178
00:09:12,325 --> 00:09:13,675
The Wei family is pitiful.

179
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,075
I have

180
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,250
given an order.

181
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:17,919
Someone

182
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:18,679
will hold the funeral

183
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,320
for them.

184
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,475
I'm kind of doing a good deed.

185
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,500
So,

186
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:28,100
I've told you before.

187
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,399
You must

188
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,559
always be merciful.

189
00:09:32,725 --> 00:09:33,519
You,

190
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,240
learn more

191
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,775
and think more.

192
00:09:42,925 --> 00:09:43,879
My Lord,

193
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,639
a guard from Xu Fengnian

194
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,080
has sent a message at the gate.

195
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,159
What is it?

196
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,800
Xu Fengnian

197
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,279
invited you to the inn.

198
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,325
Tell him

199
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,950
that I'm too busy reading scriptures
and practicing Buddhism

200
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,200
to go out of home for the moment.

201
00:09:59,575 --> 00:10:00,250
Yes.

202
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:01,440
Also,

203
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,159
the guard who has sent the message

204
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,840
is Third Graduate Lin.

205
00:10:05,525 --> 00:10:07,275
He isn't dead?

206
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:08,250
Mm.

207
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,600
I wondered
why the guard looked so familiar

208
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,639
who used Chixia Swordplay.

209
00:10:19,325 --> 00:10:20,075
Father,

210
00:10:20,075 --> 00:10:21,275
they're deceiving His Majesty.

211
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:23,720
His Majesty ordered
to exterminate the Lin family.

212
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,480
We can deal with North Liang with it.

213
00:10:27,425 --> 00:10:29,440
Pretend we don't know this.

214
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,525
See him out of our mansion.

215
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,325
Yes.

216
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:44,075
Father,

217
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:46,000
even if we don't arrest Lin,

218
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,039
you should at least check out
what Xu Fengnian will say.

219
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,519
He represents North Liang, after all.

220
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,080
If you don't go see Xu Fengnian,

221
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,639
arrest Lin, first.

222
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:54,879
Ignore him.

223
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,360
Young Master of North Liang
is here in Xiangfan,

224
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,050
but we're going to ignore him?

225
00:11:02,025 --> 00:11:03,360
Where's the student

226
00:11:03,725 --> 00:11:06,159
who offers advice to you?

227
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,360
He said he would come and visit me.

228
00:11:10,225 --> 00:11:11,775
Sit and wait, then.

229
00:11:13,475 --> 00:11:14,875
Let's wait until he comes.

230
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,650
At this moment,

231
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,360
Xu Fengnian is more important.

232
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,039
Why must you wait for a student
in Shangyin Academy?

233
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:57,150
(Mansion of Lord of Jing'an)

234
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:10,100
(Mansion of Lord of Jing'an)

235
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,825
(Mansion of Lord of Jing'an)

236
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:30,700
(Mansion of Lord of Jing'an)

237
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,080
I came by appointment,

238
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,039
to relieve anxiety

239
00:12:34,225 --> 00:12:35,225
for His Lordship and His Highness.

240
00:12:46,075 --> 00:12:47,475
I didn't see Lord of Jing'an.

241
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:50,125
I was told
that he was busy reading scriptures

242
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,850
to come out of home for the moment.

243
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,639
It doesn't matter.

244
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,440
Let's just wait.

245
00:13:00,675 --> 00:13:02,450
Will we just live in Xiangfan like this

246
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,200
until Lord of Jing'an comes to us?

247
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,625
We can just visit the town.

248
00:13:08,725 --> 00:13:10,400
You're indeed not afraid of death.

249
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,175
This is the lair of Lord of Jing'an.

250
00:13:12,175 --> 00:13:13,960
He can kill you
whenever and wherever possible.

251
00:13:15,075 --> 00:13:16,514
He won't kill me for the moment.

252
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,399
Zhao Heng is cunning.

253
00:13:18,475 --> 00:13:19,840
He's waiting for news.

254
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,500
What news?

255
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,240
News from the capital.

256
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,000
What does it have to do with you?

257
00:13:27,675 --> 00:13:28,450
Read it.

258
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:30,800
Still one coin for a word?

259
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,159
Always the fair price.

260
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,120
Greetings, My Lord, Your Grace,

261
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,025
and Your Highness.

262
00:13:46,475 --> 00:13:48,240
We've met once.

263
00:13:48,725 --> 00:13:49,840
Don't stand on ceremony.

264
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,275
Let's just get to the point.

265
00:13:52,575 --> 00:13:53,879
Yes, My Lord.

266
00:13:54,675 --> 00:13:57,639
You want to kill Xu Fengnian by my hand?

267
00:13:58,275 --> 00:13:59,425
Let me correct it.

268
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,075
I will help you

269
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:02,559
to kill Xu Fengnian.

270
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,639
Why must I kill him?

271
00:14:05,825 --> 00:14:07,200
I explained last time.

272
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:10,080
If Xu Fengnian is killed,
Xu Xiao will rebel without doubt.

273
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,700
Only when the world falls into chaos

274
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,950
can you bring order out of chaos

275
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,960
and take back the supreme throne.

276
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,480
I know.

277
00:14:24,225 --> 00:14:26,279
Han Diaosi is your master.

278
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:31,320
As the commander of eunuchs,

279
00:14:31,425 --> 00:14:32,925
he's proud and insolent.

280
00:14:33,175 --> 00:14:34,679
But he instructed you

281
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,039
without reservation.

282
00:14:37,475 --> 00:14:39,720
He even gave you Fujiang Armor

283
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,960
which was his shield.

284
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,550
Why?

285
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,750
I guess

286
00:14:47,075 --> 00:14:48,400
you know the answer.

287
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:54,080
Because your family name is Zhao.

288
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,225
Your mother died early.

289
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,360
After that, Han Diaosi sent you

290
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:05,240
to the capital.

291
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,720
Then, he sent you to Shangyin Academy.

292
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:14,879
The Academy always strictly investigates
the family background of students.

293
00:15:15,525 --> 00:15:16,799
You're the only exception.

294
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:22,095
No one has asked who your father is.

295
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,025
Who do you think

296
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,925
my father is, My Lord?

297
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,840
The Emperor.

298
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,200
Speaking of it,

299
00:15:48,575 --> 00:15:50,440
you should call me Uncle.

300
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
I'm not recorded
in the ancestral temple.

301
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,475
I'm not

302
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,120
one of the royal family.

303
00:16:02,475 --> 00:16:03,425
Right.

304
00:16:05,975 --> 00:16:07,750
If the world is in peace,

305
00:16:08,525 --> 00:16:11,559
you will never
be admitted to the capital.

306
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,759
But once the world is in chaos,

307
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,639
you'll have a chance.

308
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,639
Zhao Kai,

309
00:16:20,575 --> 00:16:21,960
you don't want to kill Xu Fengnian

310
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,001
for me,

311
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,919
but for yourself.

312
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,675
There're benefits for you and me.

313
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,600
Like I said,

314
00:16:32,475 --> 00:16:33,639
only when the world falls into chaos

315
00:16:34,975 --> 00:16:36,475
can you return

316
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:39,039
to the capital.

317
00:16:45,075 --> 00:16:45,950
Somebody!

318
00:16:54,925 --> 00:16:55,919
Take him

319
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,775
to the dungeon.

320
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,559
Wait.

321
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,480
If someone from the martial world
kills Xu Fengnian,

322
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,640
Xu Xiao will have no reason

323
00:17:09,175 --> 00:17:10,680
to blame you for that.

324
00:17:12,075 --> 00:17:14,600
I witnessed the masters
around Xu Fengnian.

325
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,680
I've gathered martial artists

326
00:17:17,525 --> 00:17:18,880
who are able to kill him.

327
00:17:20,775 --> 00:17:22,119
I'm just waiting

328
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,500
until you make up your mind.

329
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:37,925
Father,

330
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,319
he made sense.

331
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,680
If the world is in chaos,

332
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,599
you'll have a chance.

333
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,960
We can't risk our lives

334
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,680
simply for a small gain.

335
00:17:47,325 --> 00:17:48,920
It's not a small gain.

336
00:17:51,575 --> 00:17:54,480
We're not in a hurry to decide
whether we'll kill Xu Fengnian.

337
00:17:55,525 --> 00:17:57,475
Let's wait for the news.

338
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,325
What news?

339
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,625
Xu Xiao has been traveling at top speed.

340
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,519
He's arriving in the capital soon.

341
00:18:08,675 --> 00:18:10,160
When he heads for the capital alone,

342
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,079
isn't he seeking his doom?

343
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,750
So,

344
00:18:13,975 --> 00:18:15,440
don't be impatient.

345
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,625
If Xu Xiao is killed in the capital,

346
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,775
we can kill Xu Fengnian

347
00:18:22,075 --> 00:18:24,125
to make perfection still more perfect.

348
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,559
If Xu Xiao isn't killed,

349
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:28,950
why do we bother

350
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:31,279
sticking our necks out?

351
00:18:32,775 --> 00:18:35,300
The royal family treats Xu Xiao
as the one to cause chaos.

352
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,039
Once he arrives in the capital,

353
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,160
he will be killed.

354
00:18:38,775 --> 00:18:40,759
If he's sure to be killed,

355
00:18:42,775 --> 00:18:45,375
why is he rushing to the capital?

356
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,625
Calm down

357
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:55,550
and wait for the news.

358
00:19:05,975 --> 00:19:07,225
(Official Posthouse, Capital of Liyang)

359
00:20:08,925 --> 00:20:11,625
(Zhang Julu,
the prime minister of Liyang)

360
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,680
Grand Commander,

361
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,440
what a coincidence!

362
00:21:04,925 --> 00:21:06,225
Prime Minister Zhang.

363
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,525
Long time no see.

364
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:15,050
You came all the way to the capital.

365
00:21:15,425 --> 00:21:17,119
Why haven't you entered the town?

366
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,000
I just saw the tree.

367
00:21:20,275 --> 00:21:21,225
It reminded me of the old days.

368
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,375
How can the tree

369
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:30,050
remind you of the old days?

370
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:34,425
When my wife and I
came to the capital for the first time,

371
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,880
we rested under the tree.

372
00:21:37,425 --> 00:21:38,480
We even made a mark

373
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:40,839
on it.

374
00:21:41,775 --> 00:21:43,319
So,

375
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,440
you're missing your wife?

376
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,275
She's been dead.

377
00:21:48,825 --> 00:21:50,119
Luckily, the tree is still here.

378
00:21:50,725 --> 00:21:51,875
It's kind of

379
00:21:52,525 --> 00:21:53,599
a souvenir to me.

380
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,759
Cut it down.

381
00:22:13,925 --> 00:22:17,100
It's such a precious tree.

382
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,475
You'd better take it back to North Liang

383
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:22,759
so that you can see it every day

384
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,320
and miss your wife.

385
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,100
Prime Minister,

386
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,400
you travel with axes?

387
00:22:40,725 --> 00:22:42,480
I only take some axes today.

388
00:22:43,025 --> 00:22:44,799
Isn't it a coincidence?

389
00:22:45,525 --> 00:22:46,359
It is.

390
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,075
It's quite a coincidence.

391
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:53,960
Let's get into the town.

392
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,160
Don't stop

393
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,150
until you cut it down!

394
00:23:31,825 --> 00:23:38,700
(Zhang Julu provoked...)

395
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:42,475
(Xu Xiao gave way.)

396
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:25,600
I'm all right.

397
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,450
This is Xu Xiao?

398
00:24:40,675 --> 00:24:42,250
News just came

399
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,375
that outside the city gate,

400
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:45,750
Prime Minister Zhang
prevailed over him.

401
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,949
This is the capital,

402
00:24:46,949 --> 00:24:48,189
not North Liang.

403
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,359
It's the imperial palace.

404
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,400
I don't think he dare to be aggressive.

405
00:24:54,525 --> 00:24:55,300
Go.

406
00:24:59,275 --> 00:25:00,319
I'm Xu Xiao.

407
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,279
I ask to meet His Majesty.

408
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,550
Grand Commander,
please wait here for a moment.

409
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:37,000
You came to the palace
with your blade and horse.

410
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,759
How arrogant you are!

411
00:25:40,525 --> 00:25:41,880
In such an important place,

412
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,275
you'd better behave yourself.

413
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,450
Who are you?

414
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,175
Grand Master for Splendid Happiness,

415
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,319
(Liu Tiren, third-rank master of Liyang)
Liu Tiren.

416
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,920
Oh, sub-third rank?

417
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,950
The old system is adopted!

418
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,640
The Grand Master
for Splendid Happiness

419
00:26:02,775 --> 00:26:04,079
is sort of the third rank!

420
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:07,759
Oh, sort of?

421
00:26:08,225 --> 00:26:09,279
You're indeed powerful.

422
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,279
Powerful.

423
00:26:10,925 --> 00:26:12,350
I'm not talking about power,

424
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:14,575
but etiquette.

425
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,175
Oh.

426
00:26:18,275 --> 00:26:19,000
Come on.

427
00:26:28,475 --> 00:26:31,125
It's not only about the robe.

428
00:26:31,225 --> 00:26:33,125
You shouldn't carry the blade, either.

429
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,839
What's this?

430
00:26:45,475 --> 00:26:47,175
The python pattern, clearly.

431
00:26:47,175 --> 00:26:47,850
Python pattern?

432
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,519
How many claws?

433
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,225
Five claws?

434
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
According to the etiquette,

435
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,599
who dare

436
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,475
to wear a five-claw robe?

437
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,900
Relatives of the royal family.

438
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,839
The blue robe is usually for lords

439
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,075
with a different surname.

440
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:13,519
Can a lord with a different surname

441
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,839
carry a blade to the court?

442
00:27:19,225 --> 00:27:20,750
Bestowed by His Majesty,

443
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,839
I can take the blade to the court.

444
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:27,400
It's an imperial favor from His Majesty.

445
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,960
As a third-rank official,

446
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,920
you want me to take away my blade?

447
00:27:37,025 --> 00:27:38,400
Here it is.

448
00:27:39,175 --> 00:27:39,775
I...

449
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,880
I was just reminding you.

450
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,599
Reminding me?

451
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,100
When a third-rank official

452
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,400
meets a lord,

453
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,300
should he kneel?

454
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,525
You keep talking about etiquette,

455
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,000
but you behave against it.

456
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,850
Mr. Liu, you're having
greater authority

457
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:02,720
than the favor from His Majesty.

458
00:28:02,825 --> 00:28:03,880
Ridiculous!

459
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:05,300
Don't talk nonsense!

460
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,740
How dare you beat me!

461
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:11,025
I just want that.

462
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,400
Somebody!

463
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,559
Help!

464
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,375
Somebody!

465
00:28:21,525 --> 00:28:23,275
Help!

466
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,125
Liu Tiren.

467
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,079
He fishes for fame.

468
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,640
He wants to get an upright reputation
by using Xu Xiao.

469
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:02,119
How sinister!

470
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,599
Does he really think

471
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,000
Xu Xiao is scared of me?

472
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:18,400
Have a message sent to Qingzhou

473
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,920
to Lord of Jing'an.

474
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,960
We don't do something
because we're forced to,

475
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,039
but because we want to.

476
00:29:50,825 --> 00:29:52,775
Help me!

477
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:03,525
Do you know

478
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,279
why I didn't make a fuss

479
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,599
with Zhang Julu?

480
00:30:08,525 --> 00:30:10,100
Because he's the Prime Minister?

481
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,000
It's not because of his position.

482
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,160
Zhang Julu

483
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,675
serves His Majesty,

484
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,350
regardless of his own life.

485
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,799
I have

486
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:21,279
a little admiration for him

487
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,160
more or less.

488
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,359
As for you,

489
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,200
you're simply asking for trouble.

490
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,160
Come on.

491
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,925
Let's continue.

492
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,382
Come on.

493
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,700
Grand Commander.

494
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,950
Grand Commander.

495
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,039
(Fengtian Hall)

496
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,559
(Monk Yang Taisui)
Greeting, Grand Commander.

497
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:40,400
Yang Taisui.

498
00:30:42,175 --> 00:30:43,375
Grand Commander,

499
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,050
what are you doing?

500
00:30:45,575 --> 00:30:47,119
I was bored waiting.

501
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:47,960
I just beat him for fun.

502
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:51,359
Beating a third-rank official for fun?

503
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:53,200
He...

504
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,720
He was brave.

505
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,920
Grand Commander,

506
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,800
His Majesty is feeling unwell

507
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,825
and he can't see you for the moment.

508
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:09,200
Oh.

509
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,359
You,

510
00:31:11,675 --> 00:31:13,079
walk me out.

511
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:15,977
Come on.

512
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,900
Yang Taisui.

513
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,880
Look at you.

514
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,240
I'm increasingly admiring you.

515
00:31:25,575 --> 00:31:28,799
Kings and bears
often worry their keepers.

516
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,880
But you've kept His Majesty company
for decades.

517
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,000
If you live
for another twenty or thirty years,

518
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,480
you will have served three dynasties.

519
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,680
Then you'll be the real Grand Abbot.

520
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,680
I'm an ordinary monk

521
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,440
without an official position.

522
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:45,640
Monk?

523
00:31:46,425 --> 00:31:48,480
There's no ordinary monk like you.

524
00:31:52,025 --> 00:31:53,160
Think about it.

525
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,119
How long has it been since we last met?

526
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:56,839
Yeah.

527
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:59,950
It's been many years
since you came to the capital last time.

528
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:02,279
I'm getting old

529
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,880
and I'm getting more cowardly.

530
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,525
You? Cowardly?

531
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:07,175
Mm.

532
00:32:07,575 --> 00:32:09,825
You beat a third-rank official
in front of Fengtian Hall.

533
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:11,799
If you were cowardly,

534
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:12,850
no one in this world

535
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:15,175
could be bold.

536
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,240
By the way,

537
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,640
is His Majesty

538
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,279
really sick

539
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:24,400
or does he not want to see me?

540
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,279
Don't you know?

541
00:32:30,275 --> 00:32:31,480
Tell me.

542
00:32:32,043 --> 00:32:32,793
Well,

543
00:32:32,793 --> 00:32:34,759
how long do I have to wait

544
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:35,920
before he wants to see me?

545
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,519
It depends on

546
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,559
how your son leaves Qingzhou.

547
00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:48,200
You old pal.

548
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,279
You told me the truth!

549
00:32:51,525 --> 00:32:52,225
So,

550
00:32:52,225 --> 00:32:53,640
among millions of people in the capital,

551
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,079
you're my only friend.

552
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,775
I can be your friend

553
00:32:59,775 --> 00:33:01,480
as long as you don't touch my head.

554
00:33:02,325 --> 00:33:03,240
Right.

555
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:05,075
It's said

556
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,550
that two things can't be touched.

557
00:33:07,675 --> 00:33:09,319
The buttocks of a tiger

558
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:10,400
as well as

559
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,625
your head.

560
00:33:13,475 --> 00:33:14,480
Here it goes again.

561
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,319
Go, go, go.

562
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:15,950
Let's go play chess.

563
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:16,519
Go.

564
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:25,100
(Zhang Julu provoked
outside the capital. Xu Xiao gave way.)

565
00:33:36,425 --> 00:33:38,559
Zhang Julu provoked outside the capital.

566
00:33:38,925 --> 00:33:40,799
Xu Xiao gave way.

567
00:33:41,425 --> 00:33:43,599
Prime Minister Zhang...

568
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,400
Everybody knows

569
00:33:45,575 --> 00:33:46,920
that he's very ambitious.

570
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,900
What he wants to do most

571
00:33:50,475 --> 00:33:52,079
is to dethrone the lords.

572
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,599
How dare he!

573
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,240
Royal clans like us
are not his first target.

574
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:03,359
North Liang is the first

575
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:05,600
he wants to handle.

576
00:34:06,675 --> 00:34:07,559
Xu Xiao?

577
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:11,039
Zhang Julu provoked Xu Xiao
outside the capital,

578
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:13,400
to force Xu Xiao to fight him.

579
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:18,300
Once Xu Xiao kills the Prime Minister,

580
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:20,960
His Majesty has no choice,

581
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:22,775
but to execute him.

582
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,400
Doesn't Zhang Julu care
for his own life?

583
00:34:27,675 --> 00:34:29,625
He will risk his life for fame.

584
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,239
That's what intellectuals do, isn't it?

585
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,500
However,

586
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,199
even though

587
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:39,159
Zhang Julu has
different political views,

588
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:42,840
Xu Xiao and I

589
00:34:43,225 --> 00:34:45,159
kind of admire him.

590
00:34:46,675 --> 00:34:48,900
Xu Xiao has been in the capital.

591
00:34:50,525 --> 00:34:51,800
Why hasn't His Majesty killed him yet?

592
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,199
His Majesty?

593
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,200
My second eldest brother...

594
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,599
He's far-sighted.

595
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,950
If Xu Xiao dies in the capital,

596
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,280
North Liang Army will rebel.

597
00:35:04,425 --> 00:35:08,039
He wants Xu Xiao to die of old age

598
00:35:08,425 --> 00:35:11,559
so that the playboy Xu Fengnian
will take the throne.

599
00:35:11,875 --> 00:35:13,679
When there's civil strife
in North Liang,

600
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:15,325
he'll draw some generals over
and drive a wedge.

601
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:18,239
He doesn't need
to send even a single soldier

602
00:35:18,775 --> 00:35:21,150
before North Liang breaks down.

603
00:35:21,775 --> 00:35:24,880
So, His Majesty disagrees
with Zhang Julu?

604
00:35:26,775 --> 00:35:30,039
Yes, or why would Zhang Julu

605
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:32,519
provoke Xu Xiao outside the capital

606
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:34,519
when he was always calm?

607
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,725
He did that

608
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:41,519
to drive Xu Xiao into the impasse.

609
00:35:42,325 --> 00:35:43,150
No wonder

610
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,975
Xu Xiao didn't fight Zhang Julu.

611
00:35:46,975 --> 00:35:49,519
Xu Xiao is quite crafty.

612
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,400
He won't easily be tricked.

613
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:57,650
Xu Xiao arrived in the capital
a couple of days ago.

614
00:35:58,225 --> 00:35:59,960
Why does His Majesty
still refuse to see him yet?

615
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,920
He's waiting for our action.

616
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,920
Our action?

617
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,550
This is a message

618
00:36:18,225 --> 00:36:19,320
from Zhang Julu.

619
00:36:19,475 --> 00:36:21,960
We don't do something
because we're forced to,

620
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:24,300
but because we want to.

621
00:36:26,575 --> 00:36:27,800
What does it mean?

622
00:36:29,025 --> 00:36:30,480
There are five kinds of rites.

623
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:32,559
The sacrificial rite
is the most important.

624
00:36:34,475 --> 00:36:35,639
We offer the sacrificial rite

625
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:39,119
not because we're forced to,

626
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,880
but because we want to.

627
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,360
It's about the sacrificial rite.

628
00:36:46,675 --> 00:36:49,450
Not because we're forced to,
but because we want to.

629
00:36:50,425 --> 00:36:52,360
Zhang Julu is reminding me

630
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:56,519
that we shouldn't take action forcibly,

631
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,300
but spontaneously.

632
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,625
What action?

633
00:37:04,825 --> 00:37:06,550
He's urging me

634
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,725
to kill Xu Fengnian spontaneously.

635
00:37:10,175 --> 00:37:10,950
What?

636
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:15,225
His Majesty doesn't meet Xu Xiao,

637
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,400
because he's waiting to see

638
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,719
what Xu Fengnian will suffer
in our place.

639
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,000
North Liang and we

640
00:37:28,075 --> 00:37:29,559
have been at a stalemate
for a long time.

641
00:37:30,575 --> 00:37:31,639
If Xu Fengnian

642
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:33,639
leaves Xiangfan so easily,

643
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,199
His Majesty will suspect

644
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:40,920
that we've joined hands
with North Liang secretly.

645
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,750
If we kill Xu Fengnian,

646
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,639
His Majesty will be relieved.

647
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:49,480
We offer the sacrificial rite...

648
00:37:50,725 --> 00:37:51,679
The sacrificial

649
00:37:53,225 --> 00:37:55,400
refers to the death of Xu Fengnian.

650
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:58,950
So,

651
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,079
Zhang Julu made sense.

652
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,679
Shall we kill Xu Fengnian?

653
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,880
If we kill Xu Fengnian,

654
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,000
North Liang will certainly rebel.

655
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,719
By then, His Majesty is very likely

656
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:14,400
to apologize to Xu Xiao

657
00:38:15,075 --> 00:38:17,239
with my life.

658
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,675
Prime Minister Zhang

659
00:38:20,675 --> 00:38:22,075
has got a good plan.

660
00:38:22,075 --> 00:38:24,175
He wants me to kill Xu Fengnian.

661
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:28,575
When Qingzhou and North Liang
are both destroyed,

662
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,320
his plan to dethrone lords

663
00:38:32,175 --> 00:38:34,079
will proceed without hindrance.

664
00:38:34,725 --> 00:38:37,320
Zhang Julu is quite vicious.

665
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,700
Doesn't he fear he'll be involved?

666
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,700
He just sent us a message

667
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,119
without a distinct saying.

668
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,320
He won't be involved.

669
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,760
What a man!

670
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:53,760
We're stuck in a dilemma, aren't we?

671
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,760
We should neither kill Xu Fengnian
nor keep him alive.

672
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,920
What do we do?

673
00:39:01,325 --> 00:39:02,550
Now that

674
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:04,760
all parties are watching me,

675
00:39:07,175 --> 00:39:08,719
let me do something.

676
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,440
Get the carriage ready.

677
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,719
My wife and I

678
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,960
are going to meet Xu Fengnian.

679
00:39:19,975 --> 00:39:20,875
She's going, too?

680
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,625
(Solitary Central Plains)

681
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:46,425
(Yuelai Inn)

682
00:40:02,925 --> 00:40:03,760
What's wrong?

683
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,100
Someone unkind has come.

684
00:40:06,275 --> 00:40:07,440
He's waiting in the backyard.

685
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,960
Go tell His Highness.

686
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,760
Miss Chudong, why did you come alone?

687
00:40:24,525 --> 00:40:25,475
Where's Uncle Wang?

688
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,425
Your Highness, you've got
enough beautiful girls.

689
00:40:34,025 --> 00:40:35,305
I'm not good enough for you.

690
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,920
Please let me go.

691
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:37,990
What?

692
00:40:40,075 --> 00:40:41,200
You want her?

693
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:41,800
No.

694
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,199
It's none of my business.

695
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,400
My father said so, too.

696
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:46,519
You don't believe me?

697
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,750
If you were me, would you believe it?

698
00:40:49,525 --> 00:40:51,159
If you hadn't asked for me,

699
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,519
why would my father
had made me leave with you

700
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:53,600
after he met you once?

701
00:40:58,125 --> 00:40:59,239
Lord of Jing'an has arrived.

702
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:00,800
He's waiting for you in the back room.

703
00:41:01,475 --> 00:41:02,480
At last.

704
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:04,280
Did he come alone?

705
00:41:04,425 --> 00:41:06,050
He came with his wife
and his son Zhao Xun.

706
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:07,425
A lot of guards, as well.

707
00:41:09,725 --> 00:41:10,500
All right.

708
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:14,250
I'll be right back.

709
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,000
Don't worry.

710
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,920
When I'm back,

711
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,559
I'll explain to you.

712
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,550
I'll be waiting here.

713
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:25,050
I hear Lord of Jing'an
loves his wife most.

714
00:41:27,225 --> 00:41:28,280
Does it bother you?

715
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:29,400
It's very important.

716
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,039
Exactly.

717
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:34,840
Everyone in Qingzhou knows

718
00:41:34,975 --> 00:41:37,700
Lord of Jing'an treats
Consort Pei Nanwei as a treasure.

719
00:41:38,525 --> 00:41:39,880
Everybody in Qingzhou knows that?

720
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:41,450
Yes, everybody.

721
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,760
Pei Nanwei is his second wife, right?

722
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:46,960
His first wife died many years ago.

723
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:49,200
Now, Pei Nanwei is his consort.

724
00:41:52,325 --> 00:41:53,440
I see.

725
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:54,850
Hey.

726
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,675
Would you like to go
and meet Lord of Jing'an?

727
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,550
What's the fun of that?

728
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,800
When I don't need to read,

729
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,300
I would rather go out for a stroll.

730
00:42:05,075 --> 00:42:05,875
Let's go.

731
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,900
His Lordship is expecting
Young Master Fengnian.

732
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:41,825
Irrelevant persons should stay away.

733
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,325
Wait.

734
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,440
Why are you closing the door?

735
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,440
Ning Emei,

736
00:42:52,575 --> 00:42:53,775
