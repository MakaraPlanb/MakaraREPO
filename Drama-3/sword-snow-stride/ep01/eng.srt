1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

5
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
=Sword Snow Stride=
(Season 1)

6
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,400
=Episode 1=

7
00:01:36,925 --> 00:01:38,825
I'll do a drawing,

8
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,840
and this is the Divine Land.

9
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,120
North Mang

10
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,359
rules the land of bitter cold.

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,319
I'll put it aside.

12
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,439
This is

13
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,680
the Central Plains.

14
00:01:54,925 --> 00:01:57,500
(Liyang, North Mang)

15
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,300
In those years, the world was in chaos.

16
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:00,879
(West Chu)

17
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,040
(South Tang, Dawei)
The land was fragmented

18
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,400
(East Yue)
and the states were at war.

19
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,550
(Post-Song)
The Divine Land was wobbling.

20
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:08,250
(Liyang)
Liyang

21
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,800
(West Chu)
broke through

22
00:02:09,975 --> 00:02:11,319
and wiped out the other eight states,

23
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:13,400
(South Tang, Dawei)
uniting the world.

24
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,825
(Post-Song)

25
00:02:14,825 --> 00:02:16,475
(West Shu)

26
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,800
Especially the North Liang Cavalry

27
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,199
of the Liyang Dynasty

28
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,840
quelled the unrest

29
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,520
and benefited the world

30
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,680
in an invincible manner!

31
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:26,639
One army

32
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:27,879
wiped out six states!

33
00:02:32,525 --> 00:02:33,560
This is

34
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,240
the majesty of the Lord of North Liang,

35
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,360
(Xu Xiao, the Lord of North Liang)
Xu Xiao.

36
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,650
(Xu Xiao, the Lord of North Liang)

37
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,600
If it were not for him,

38
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,900
the world

39
00:02:41,275 --> 00:02:43,159
would still be in chaos.

40
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,575
(Liang)

41
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,159
Now,

42
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,759
Liyang rules all the land

43
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,520
and Xu Xiao was made the lord

44
00:03:31,425 --> 00:03:33,175
to guard the three border states

45
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,825
and lead the 350,000 soldiers
of North Liang

46
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,360
to defend against enemy
in the wind and the snow.

47
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:41,550
This is

48
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,879
the most powerful official in Liyang,

49
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,479
a lord not born in the royal family,

50
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,400
Xu Xiao.

51
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,175
You've probably heard of

52
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,650
his reputation.

53
00:03:56,425 --> 00:03:57,800
Do you understand

54
00:03:59,175 --> 00:04:00,300
what I said?

55
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,150
I'm the oldest son

56
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,080
of the Lord of North Liang,

57
00:04:15,425 --> 00:04:16,975
the number one playboy in the world,

58
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,375
Xu,

59
00:04:19,975 --> 00:04:20,625
Feng,

60
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,875
Nian.

61
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,525
(Xu Fengnian,
the Lord of North Liang's oldest son)

62
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Today I ate some of your sweet potatoes,

63
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,200
one day,

64
00:04:29,525 --> 00:04:31,750
I'll pay you back
with a handsome reward.

65
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,025
You can count on my word.

66
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,275
(Old Huang, groom)

67
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,160
Whoever steals my sweet potatoes
must pay the money!

68
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,150
- I'm not...
- Don't run!

69
00:04:46,175 --> 00:04:47,319
- Danger!
- Wait, no...

70
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:47,875
Stop!

71
00:04:48,325 --> 00:04:48,900
You...

72
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,240
- Withdraw!
- I'm not...

73
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,950
You...!

74
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,200
Stop! Don't run!

75
00:04:56,225 --> 00:04:56,950
Put it down!

76
00:04:57,725 --> 00:04:59,825
Give yourself a chance.

77
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,480
A couple of sweet potatoes

78
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,950
can make you rich
for the rest of your life.

79
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,800
I want money!

80
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,680
I don't have any with me today.

81
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,000
Then you are a thief!

82
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:10,750
Hey, stop!

83
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,400
I told you

84
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,639
I don't have money today.

85
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
I am the son of the Lord of North Liang.

86
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,399
Do you think it's easy
to grow sweet potatoes?

87
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,759
I just ate some sweet potatoes.

88
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,920
It's not like I ate them for free.

89
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,480
I'll pay you back one day!

90
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,480
Stop!

91
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:24,200
I have no money now!

92
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,639
I'll give you the money one day!

93
00:05:31,975 --> 00:05:33,125
Wait for me!

94
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:34,360
Wait for me!

95
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:42,325
You...

96
00:05:42,825 --> 00:05:43,400
You...

97
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,050
I...

98
00:05:46,225 --> 00:05:46,775
I...

99
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,040
What are you trying to say?

100
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,175
- Stop!
- I...

101
00:05:50,275 --> 00:05:50,800
I...

102
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,560
Got it!

103
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,399
I'll guard the sweet potato
with my life!

104
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,375
Give me the money!

105
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:55,300
Old Huang!

106
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,125
Why...

107
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,800
Why didn't I kill you before?

108
00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:02,100
Give me the money!

109
00:06:04,675 --> 00:06:05,525
Good horse.

110
00:06:05,925 --> 00:06:06,839
You are more loyal than Old Huang.

111
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,075
Go on.

112
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,150
Keep running.

113
00:06:14,175 --> 00:06:14,750
You...

114
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,575
You brat...

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Stop!

116
00:06:22,825 --> 00:06:23,875
You stupid horse.

117
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,600
Are you Old Huang's son?

118
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,250
Wait.

119
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,850
You...

120
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:29,600
Run.

121
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,550
Old Huang!

122
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,175
Where are the sweet potatoes?

123
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,450
You ate them all?

124
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,325
I'm full.

125
00:07:03,575 --> 00:07:04,275
Young Master.

126
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,879
Where are your sweet potatoes?

127
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,360
I got caught.

128
00:07:08,725 --> 00:07:09,950
You didn't get beat up?

129
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,000
I gave him the horse.

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,825
You gave away the horse again?

131
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,160
That fellow

132
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,400
would stroll back by itself every time.

133
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,500
And you!

134
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,175
Eh?

135
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,400
Why didn't you
save some sweet potatoes for me?

136
00:07:25,275 --> 00:07:26,700
I couldn't stop.

137
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:27,950
Young Master.

138
00:07:28,275 --> 00:07:29,700
If you learn martial arts,

139
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,125
he wouldn't be able
to catch up with you.

140
00:07:31,725 --> 00:07:32,600
I won't learn it.

141
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,560
Young Master, where are you going?

142
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,120
I'm hungry.

143
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,040
I'll find something to eat.

144
00:07:45,275 --> 00:07:46,000
Young Master!

145
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,120
You have nothing to lose

146
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,600
by learning martial arts.

147
00:07:50,575 --> 00:07:51,350
Young Master.

148
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,000
Old Huang!

149
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,150
Here are fish.

150
00:07:58,775 --> 00:07:59,375
Right?

151
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:00,100
I saw it.

152
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:07,575
Young Master.

153
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,480
You got it?

154
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,100
It's so big.

155
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,879
Yeah.

156
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,700
This one is really big...!

157
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,959
You finally got one!

158
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:19,120
But you let it escape!

159
00:08:21,425 --> 00:08:22,200
Old Huang!

160
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,900
It's too slippery.

161
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:46,600
Hey.

162
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,425
Do you want meat?

163
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,600
Yeah.

164
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,375
There's a deserted temple
five miles ahead.

165
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:53,250
Follow us

166
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,399
and I'll give you meat.

167
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,175
All right.

168
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,559
Take care, sir!

169
00:09:11,275 --> 00:09:12,440
There are signs of battle formation.

170
00:09:13,025 --> 00:09:14,159
They don't look like
normal horse bandits.

171
00:09:14,975 --> 00:09:15,639
What do you think?

172
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,575
Young Master.

173
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,639
You can't fight.

174
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,440
Let's avoid them.

175
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,080
You can avoid them.

176
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,150
I want meat.

177
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,425
I want meat, too.

178
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,825
Come on, cheers!

179
00:09:33,225 --> 00:09:34,150
If you want meat,

180
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,250
hear the rules first!

181
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,240
Remember this name,

182
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,600
Xu Fengnian.

183
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,279
This guy should be well-dressed.

184
00:09:41,425 --> 00:09:42,550
He is heading for the north.

185
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,125
I want you to stay alert!

186
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,519
Report to me immediately

187
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,600
if you see anyone like him!

188
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,775
There will be a handsome reward

189
00:09:48,775 --> 00:09:49,879
if you find him.

190
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:50,775
Did you get it?

191
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:51,550
Got it.

192
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,550
Well-dressed Xu Fengnian.

193
00:09:58,275 --> 00:09:58,925
Hey.

194
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:00,575
Get into the temple.

195
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:01,975
Someone wants to see you.

196
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,525
(Chu)

197
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,625
The guy we're looking for, Xu Fengnian,

198
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,925
is the legitimate son of Xu Xiao,
the Lord of North Liang.

199
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,559
Three years ago,

200
00:10:48,575 --> 00:10:50,450
he left North Liang
to travel around the world.

201
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,650
I got news recently

202
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,500
that he is going back to North Liang.

203
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:55,975
I see.

204
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,360
I find it coincidental

205
00:11:01,075 --> 00:11:02,675
that you are about the same age

206
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,300
of Xu Fengnian.

207
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,100
It's coincidental indeed.

208
00:11:21,675 --> 00:11:22,800
You are slow in reaction.

209
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,919
You didn't learn martial arts?

210
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,159
Would I end up like this

211
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,325
if I learned martial arts?

212
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,080
You are about his age.

213
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,925
I have to give it a try.

214
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,120
Is Xu Fengnian good at fighting?

215
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,575
He is Xu Xiao's son.

216
00:11:50,775 --> 00:11:51,775
It would be strange if he isn't.

217
00:11:58,775 --> 00:12:00,275
Why aren't you scared at all

218
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,450
when you heard the name
of the Lord of North Liang?

219
00:12:02,325 --> 00:12:03,175
I feel scared inside.

220
00:12:04,575 --> 00:12:05,799
You don't change color

221
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:06,950
in the face of a horse bandit's sword.

222
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,559
That's not normal.

223
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,550
I know you're not a horse bandit.

224
00:12:12,675 --> 00:12:13,925
Who am I then?

225
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,550
I know

226
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:22,075
this flag.

227
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,650
Tell me about it.

228
00:12:24,575 --> 00:12:27,120
This is the military flag
of the Halberd Troops of West Chu.

229
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,200
In the Jinghe Battle,

230
00:12:31,725 --> 00:12:33,159
120,000 soldiers

231
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,250
were annihilated,

232
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,400
thus West Chu

233
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,679
perished.

234
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,150
How could you know that?

235
00:12:41,525 --> 00:12:42,500
My father

236
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,039
told me not to forget this flag.

237
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,200
Are you

238
00:12:51,775 --> 00:12:52,875
also from Chu?

239
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,675
Are you one of the Halberd Troops?

240
00:12:59,925 --> 00:13:00,725
Little brother.

241
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,039
What's your name?

242
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:02,650
I...

243
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,925
My country

244
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,675
was defeated and my clan slaughtered.

245
00:13:12,075 --> 00:13:14,975
You and I are just wandering ghosts.

246
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,799
I don't have a name anymore.

247
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,000
Yeah.

248
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,675
You and I are

249
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,575
just ghosts.

250
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,120
Watch your words.

251
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,225
How's it?

252
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,625
They're here to kill me.

253
00:14:05,425 --> 00:14:06,225
Are you all right?

254
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,840
He thought I'm also from Chu.

255
00:14:10,275 --> 00:14:11,200
The leader

256
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,159
is crying inside.

257
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,350
Young Master.

258
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,850
You have nothing to lose
by learning martial arts.

259
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:18,600
Stop nagging me.

260
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,125
Why don't you eat the bowl, too?

261
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,750
A pinch of salt

262
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,080
makes it smell good

263
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,279
and gives you strength.

264
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,125
I added salt for you.

265
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,700
Slow down.

266
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:36,075
It's all yours.

267
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:36,600
Um.

268
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,850
(Chu)

269
00:14:44,475 --> 00:14:46,425
(Chu)

270
00:15:12,975 --> 00:15:15,475
(Chu)

271
00:15:23,775 --> 00:15:30,775
(Chu)

272
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,175
Those soldiers of Chu

273
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,759
even paid beggars to be their informers.

274
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,080
Thank God I'm smart.

275
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,100
Yeah, yeah.

276
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:47,125
What are you looking at?

277
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,925
Our horse

278
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:50,639
should be back

279
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,120
by now.

280
00:15:52,525 --> 00:15:53,960
That stupid horse is like a ghost.

281
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,799
Don't worry about it.

282
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,480
Let's hurry back to Lingzhou.

283
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,279
Yes, yes.

284
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:04,000
Is that our horse?

285
00:16:10,725 --> 00:16:11,750
It is.

286
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,325
That fellow.

287
00:16:13,725 --> 00:16:15,100
It's ahead of us.

288
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,000
Sit down!

289
00:16:19,175 --> 00:16:19,875
Sit down!

290
00:16:21,475 --> 00:16:22,725
Keep your voice down.

291
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:23,325
Got it.

292
00:16:23,325 --> 00:16:24,000
Nice to meet you.

293
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,025
Xu Fengnian!

294
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,720
Xu Fengnian?

295
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,400
Yeah.

296
00:16:42,325 --> 00:16:44,150
Xu Fengnian is a horse.

297
00:16:44,475 --> 00:16:45,575
What a surprise.

298
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,100
On the tree.

299
00:16:47,675 --> 00:16:48,400
Oh.

300
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:49,575
Get down.

301
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,875
The age is right.

302
00:16:53,075 --> 00:16:54,100
He is also going north.

303
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,575
He might be Xu Fengnian.

304
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:57,350
Yeah.

305
00:16:57,825 --> 00:16:58,875
- Report to Master now.
- Yes.

306
00:16:58,875 --> 00:16:59,650
Let's keep watch here.

307
00:17:05,575 --> 00:17:06,225
Don't move!

308
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:06,725
Yes.

309
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:07,375
Don't move!

310
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,680
Young Master.

311
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,700
What should we do?

312
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:41,925
Let's escape.

313
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,150
What about that guy?

314
00:18:44,775 --> 00:18:46,325
He's not me.
He'll be fine after he explains it.

315
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:46,825
Let's go.

316
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:47,526
Young Master.

317
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,519
Let's watch it. It would help you
learn martial arts.

318
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:52,350
I'm not interested in fighting.

319
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,200
What's your name?

320
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:06,425
Is your surname Xu?

321
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:23,325
Stop!

322
00:19:23,575 --> 00:19:24,650
I'm asking you!

323
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,550
I was passing by.

324
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,825
I'm not one of them.

325
00:21:30,775 --> 00:21:31,675
You were

326
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:32,775
awesome.

327
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,079
Look at that stupid horse.

328
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:00,150
How does it go with her?

329
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,050
Old Huang.

330
00:22:05,225 --> 00:22:05,825
Ah.

331
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,775
Is that a guy or a girl?

332
00:22:10,075 --> 00:22:11,925
I'm not very experienced.

333
00:22:13,475 --> 00:22:15,400
Does she look like a fox?

334
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:32,359
She's also going north.

335
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:39,925
It's the portrait of Xu Fengnian.

336
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,599
They just sent it over.

337
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,800
Xu Fengnian!

338
00:22:49,225 --> 00:22:49,950
Hey!

339
00:22:50,425 --> 00:22:51,150
Hey!

340
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,200
Please stay.

341
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,725
Don't get me wrong.

342
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,039
We are also

343
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,000
on our way.

344
00:22:59,325 --> 00:23:01,225
I just want to give you a heads-up

345
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,400
that if anyone comes after you later,

346
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,200
just tell him your name
and you'll be fine,

347
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:06,975
unless your last name is also Xu.

348
00:23:08,225 --> 00:23:09,050
Do you get it?

349
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:13,475
Anyway, I told you. Let's go.

350
00:23:13,575 --> 00:23:14,250
Oh.

351
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:27,075
Hold on.

352
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,400
Let me try again.

353
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,375
What a stupid horse.

354
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:46,275
Come on.

355
00:23:48,075 --> 00:23:49,175
It has been three years.

356
00:23:49,425 --> 00:23:50,700
The horse is also old.

357
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:52,525
It depends on its mood.

358
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,160
I think...

359
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:54,680
Eh.

360
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,920
This stupid horse is your son.

361
00:23:56,075 --> 00:23:57,279
I have a son now.

362
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:15,375
- Stop!
- Stop!

363
00:24:17,475 --> 00:24:18,225
Stop!

364
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:20,440
Stop! Don't run!

365
00:24:31,475 --> 00:24:32,125
Sir.

366
00:24:32,775 --> 00:24:33,800
We meet again.

367
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:35,750
Have you found Xu Fengnian?

368
00:24:38,425 --> 00:24:39,975
You are Xu Xiao's son!

369
00:24:41,275 --> 00:24:43,160
You must be joking with me.

370
00:24:58,925 --> 00:25:00,319
I didn't see the portrait yesterday.

371
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,350
They just sent it over.

372
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,119
Your time is up.

373
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,250
Where did you get it?

374
00:25:05,425 --> 00:25:07,640
Among 350,000 men in Xu's cavalry,

375
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,839
there will always be a few

376
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,350
who want you dead.

377
00:25:12,825 --> 00:25:14,599
It was from the North Liang Army.

378
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,225
Xu Fengnian!

379
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,750
My country fell.

380
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:20,175
I'll use your head as an offering today.

381
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,359
I was just a child

382
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:23,400
when West Chu fell.

383
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:24,799
I didn't fight in the war.

384
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:25,680
Yes, yes.

385
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,880
Xu Xiao killed countless enemies.

386
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,440
He is known as the Human Slayer.

387
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,680
You'll pay your father's debts.

388
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:30,775
Just blame yourself

389
00:25:31,575 --> 00:25:33,319
for being born in the wrong family.

390
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,480
You should get revenge on Xu Xiao!

391
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:36,400
That's right.

392
00:25:42,225 --> 00:25:43,175
He is scared?

393
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,275
It's possible.

394
00:25:44,425 --> 00:25:45,625
Cut it out!

395
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:48,799
Old Huang is just a groom.

396
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:49,850
He has nothing to do with Xu Xiao.

397
00:25:50,225 --> 00:25:52,240
Xu's groom should also die.

398
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:53,480
Old Huang, go now.

399
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,475
Sir.

400
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:00,400
Can you give me a chance?

401
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,525
I want to forsake darkness
for light today.

402
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:05,925
I also want to kill Xu Xiao.

403
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,575
I'll pay for my life!

404
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,075
As long as you can save me,

405
00:26:19,075 --> 00:26:20,075
I'll let you make a price!

406
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,175
Listen.

407
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,359
I will kill Xu Xiao,

408
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:31,039
but I'll kill his children first

409
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,480
and take all hope from him.

410
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,775
A coward has a lot of excuses.

411
00:26:38,425 --> 00:26:39,240
You are seeking your death!

412
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:54,500
Who are you?

413
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,500
What's your relationship with Xu Xiao?

414
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,100
He is my father.

415
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,799
Are you the son
of the Lord of North Liang?

416
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:17,150
I look noble when I'm cleaned up.

417
00:27:17,425 --> 00:27:18,400
Xu Xiao is brutal!

418
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:19,725
He is the enemy of the world!

419
00:27:20,325 --> 00:27:21,750
If you make way for me today,

420
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,425
I'll owe you one!

421
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:41,440
If I save your life,

422
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,960
you let me in Tingchao Pavilion.

423
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:51,125
Okay.

424
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,200
You go first.

425
00:27:58,975 --> 00:27:59,575
Old Huang.

426
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,650
Have you made up your mind?

427
00:28:02,925 --> 00:28:04,225
This is none of your business!

428
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,475
Good.

429
00:28:08,075 --> 00:28:08,875
In that case,

430
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,200
bros.

431
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,675
Kill them all!

432
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,720
Cool.

433
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,275
What should I call you?

434
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,375
Whatever you want.

435
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:28,450
Old Huang.

436
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:28,925
Ah?

437
00:28:28,925 --> 00:28:30,075
Does she look like a fox?

438
00:28:32,775 --> 00:28:34,900
She has a white face and white hands.

439
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:38,575
I'll call you

440
00:28:38,725 --> 00:28:40,025
White Fox then.

441
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,400
I can call you something else
if you don't like it.

442
00:28:43,775 --> 00:28:45,225
Are you really Xu Xiao's son?

443
00:28:45,425 --> 00:28:47,450
You'll know

444
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:49,240
after you send me back to Lingzhou

445
00:28:49,825 --> 00:28:51,200
and we enter
the Mansion of Lord of North Liang.

446
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,750
It's a deal then.

447
00:28:58,175 --> 00:28:59,400
That's what I'm gonna call you.

448
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,425
Why do you have a long sword
and a short one?

449
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:08,025
I didn't see you
draw two swords just now.

450
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,575
They don't deserve it.

451
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,750
What kind of people deserve it then?

452
00:29:21,575 --> 00:29:22,325
Get them!

453
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,200
Do you want some?

454
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,200
Why are you going to Tingchao Pavilion?

455
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,300
Xu Xiao has been everywhere
around the world.

456
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,975
I heard that Tingchao Pavilion collected
all kinds of books on martial arts.

457
00:30:01,975 --> 00:30:03,950
You're already skillful in martial arts.

458
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,880
Why do you need those books?

459
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,650
I'm not good enough.

460
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,300
How good do you want to be?

461
00:30:14,425 --> 00:30:15,100
Don't move.

462
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,400
Let's keep eating.

463
00:30:51,175 --> 00:30:52,100
Is it them again?

464
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:54,775
They are lying up there.

465
00:30:55,025 --> 00:30:56,075
They can't move for a while.

466
00:30:57,025 --> 00:30:58,225
Even you can't fight,

467
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,450
you can kill them easily.

468
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,500
You want me to kill them?

469
00:31:06,425 --> 00:31:07,350
It's up to you.

470
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,189
Never mind.

471
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:09,900
Let them live.

472
00:31:11,725 --> 00:31:12,650
Are you afraid to kill people?

473
00:31:13,925 --> 00:31:14,750
No.

474
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:18,359
Xu Xiao annihilated their country

475
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:19,279
and they hate Xu Xiao.

476
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,359
It's a grudge between them.

477
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,400
I'm not that stupid

478
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,000
to take on their grudge.

479
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,960
Your father is Xu Xiao.

480
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,880
He is who he is.

481
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,650
I am who I am.

482
00:31:32,575 --> 00:31:33,325
What?

483
00:31:43,075 --> 00:31:44,475
This sword is called Xiudong.

484
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,225
It's three feet, two inches long.

485
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,119
It weighs ten catties and nine taels.

486
00:31:49,275 --> 00:31:50,500
The edge is blunt,

487
00:31:50,925 --> 00:31:52,050
as the way in the world.

488
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,875
This sword is called Chunlei.

489
00:32:00,175 --> 00:32:01,725
It's two feet, four inches long.

490
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,400
It weighs one catty and three taels.

491
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,240
When a hair falls on it,
it can cut it in half.

492
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:07,750
It's the sharpest sword,

493
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:11,575
as the evil hearts of humans.

494
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,750
What do you mean?

495
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:16,025
I don't kill,

496
00:32:16,025 --> 00:32:17,325
so I deserve to see your swords?

497
00:32:17,475 --> 00:32:18,235
Go to sleep.

498
00:32:18,675 --> 00:32:19,375
I'll keep watch.

499
00:32:21,675 --> 00:32:23,875
Are you guys all like this?

500
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,650
Go to sleep, Young Master.

501
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,125
Okay.

502
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,367
I wonder what the jackass Wenhua

503
00:32:43,367 --> 00:32:44,775
is doing.

504
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:58,075
I can't sleep.

505
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,640
How about

506
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,599
I sing a song

507

508
00:33:02,475 --> 00:33:03,225

Let's get on the road back to Lingzhou.

523
00:35:07,025 --> 00:35:07,850
What about her?

524
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,700
A person's mind is unpredictable.

525
00:35:10,825 --> 00:35:12,639
She can kill me with her sword.

526
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:13,650
There's no need to save me.

527
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:15,925
I'm afraid you are not the one
she wants to kill.

528
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:18,039
You mean

529
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:19,875
she wants to get in the mansion
to kill Xu Xiao?

530
00:35:20,575 --> 00:35:22,175
You can never be too careful.

531
00:35:23,925 --> 00:35:25,599
Isn't she skillful in martial arts?

532
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,400
How come she doesn't even know
we're leaving?

533
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:29,880
Do you remember

534
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,775
the knockout drops

535
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:32,239
we stole from the gangster inn

536
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:33,400
last time?

537
00:35:34,725 --> 00:35:36,079
I put some

538
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:37,200
into the sweet potato.

539
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,250
Old Huang!

540
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:39,760
Let's go now. She's fine.

541
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,679
She'll wake up.

542
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:41,375
Hurry.

543

(The Mansion of Lord of North Liang,
Lingzhou)

544
00:35:48,975 --> 00:35:51,275

(Xu Longxiang, the second son
of the Lord of North Liang)

546

Your Highness.

547
00:35:55,725 --> 00:35:56,625
It's getting cold.

548
00:35:56,625 --> 00:35:57,625
Let's go back to the mansion.

549
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:58,750
Yeah.

550
00:35:58,750 --> 00:35:59,639
His Lordship

551
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:00,440
is still looking for you.

552
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:01,800
It has been three years.

553
00:36:02,525 --> 00:36:03,700
My brother's coming home.

554
00:36:04,775 --> 00:36:05,900
I'll wait for him.

555
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:21,825
There is a mouthful of it.

556
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,100
Only a mouthful of it?

557
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:31,320
It's not a mouthful.

558
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,600
There are just a few drops.

559
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,275
Young Master.

560
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:43,320
We are at the border of Lingzhou.

561
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:43,880
Keep going.

562
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,000
Come on. Let's go.

563
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,800
I can't.

564
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:47,100
I've been walking all night.

565
00:36:48,225 --> 00:36:49,400
Let's take a break at the wine shop.

566
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,000
Ah.

00:36:56,925 --> 00:36:58,825
(Apricot Flower Wine Shop)

568
00:37:11,175 --> 00:37:12,750
It's the smell of North Liang.

569
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:15,500
It smells so good!

570
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:16,525
Waiter!

571
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:17,600
Bring wine!

572
00:37:17,675 --> 00:37:18,450
Coming!

573
00:37:25,425 --> 00:37:26,350
Sirs.

574
00:37:26,975 --> 00:37:28,900
Our signature apricot flower wine

575
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,550
is 20 pennies a pot.

576
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:31,350
It's not expensive,

577
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,850
but not cheap, either.

578
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:34,159
Put it on my tab.

579
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:35,679
Someone will bring the money later.

580
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:36,525
You'll have a tip, too.

581
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:37,300
Put it on your tab?

582
00:37:37,675 --> 00:37:38,360
Sir.

583
00:37:38,975 --> 00:37:40,975
Are you drunk before you start to drink?

584
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:42,199
It's a small business.

585
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:43,150
No credit here.

586
00:37:44,875 --> 00:37:45,775
Waiter!

587
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,475
Bring them wine!

588
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:50,800
Bring them the best wine!

589
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:51,425
Yeah.

590
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,200
What a shame.

591
00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:58,950
You are so close to Lingzhou,

592
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,400
but you can't go back.

593
00:38:06,025 --> 00:38:07,760
Thanks for buying me a drink.

594
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,925
It smells good!

595
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,320
Old Huang, why do you always
want my stuff?

596
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,239
All right.

597
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:21,199
Don't spill it.

598
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:22,300
Drink the wine

599
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:24,000
before you hit the road!

600
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,239
There is also meat.

601
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:55,400
Does our agreement still count?

602
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,050
Of course.

603
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:04,750
Brother!

604
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:05,525
Brother!

605
00:39:08,625 --> 00:39:10,200
Let's not break the wine shop.

606
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,150
Kill her!

607
00:39:17,325 --> 00:39:18,750
This is North Liang.

608
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:27,725
It's okay.

609
00:39:27,725 --> 00:39:28,525
Go on.

610
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:30,625
Brother!

611
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,650
(Liang)

612
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,450
(Liang)

613
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:06,675
Oh no.

614
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,200
It's the North Liang Cavalry.

615
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,599
Do you have to be dead

616
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:24,850
to drop your sword?

617
00:40:29,025 --> 00:40:30,450
Men are no match for

618
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,700
the North Liang Cavalry.

619
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,775
Drop the weapon.

620
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,950
(Ning Emei, General of Fengzi Battalion)
Ning Emei, General of Fengzi Battalion,

621
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,375
greets Your Highness.

622
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,150
You,

623
00:40:59,525 --> 00:41:00,150
get down.

624
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:04,625
Dismount from the horse.

625
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,800
No one dares to stand in the way
of the North Liang battle steed.

626
00:41:10,675 --> 00:41:11,475
Get down!

627
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,320
I ask you to dismount.

628
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:27,450
General Ning!

629
00:41:33,225 --> 00:41:35,119
Someone in the North Liang Army
sent my portrait

630
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:36,600
to the bandits.

631
00:41:37,325 --> 00:41:38,440
Do you know it?

632
00:41:38,975 --> 00:41:41,239
There is no such person
in the North Liang Army.

633
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,960
All I see is General Ning

634
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,475
trying to kill my friend.

635
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,719
I was ordered
to take Your Highness back home.

636
00:41:47,225 --> 00:41:47,920
Whoever stands in my way

637
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,679
is disobeying the order!

638
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:51,875
What if I ask you to dismount?

639
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:53,880
Brother!

640
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,079
Brother!

641
00:41:57,975 --> 00:41:58,600
Brother!

642
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,050
- Brother!
- Your Highness.

643
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:03,440
Brother.

644
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,314
- Get up.
- Brother.

645
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:06,600
Let's sit down and talk.

646
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:09,200
Come on.

647
00:42:12,275 --> 00:42:13,375
Let me take a good look at you.

648
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,700
You've grown up.

649
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:18,925
Your Highness.

650
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,475
I took the military order

651
00:42:20,725 --> 00:42:21,719
to take His Highness
back to the mansion.

652
00:42:27,825 --> 00:42:29,400
My Huangman'er is here.

653
00:42:30,225 --> 00:42:31,150
I'm tired.

654
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:33,500
I want to go home.

655
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,725
Well...

656
00:42:36,825 --> 00:42:37,925
Let's go home now.

657
00:42:38,725 --> 00:42:39,400
No hurry.

658
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,950
Let's go home together

659
00:42:44,275 --> 00:42:45,425
after filling our bellies.

660
00:42:47,275 --> 00:42:47,975
Okay.

661
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:53,760
Waiter!

662
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:57,150
