1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

5
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
=Sword Snow Stride=
(Season 1)

6
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,400
=Episode 25=

7
00:01:35,475 --> 00:01:36,300
So,

8
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,540
more than twenty years ago,

9
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,580
you went to Wudi City?

10
00:01:39,275 --> 00:01:40,900
We fought in the capital.

11
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,950
Wang Xianzhi was once in the capital?

12
00:01:45,575 --> 00:01:46,820
Why does nobody know that?

13
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,660
Something big happened that night.

14
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,700
Related news has been wiped out.

15
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,575
More than twenty years ago?

16
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,450
What happened in the capital?

17
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,325
If I hadn't run into Wang Xianzhi

18
00:02:01,325 --> 00:02:02,350
that night,

19
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,625
Wu Su

20
00:02:04,275 --> 00:02:06,800
wouldn't have left the capital alive.

21
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,420
Wu Su?

22
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,180
Wu Su...

23
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:17,675
Consort of the Lord of North Liang?

24
00:02:19,575 --> 00:02:20,500
She could be

25
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,375
the most talented swordswoman

26
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,940
in the Sword Tomb of the Wu Family
over these years.

27
00:02:25,975 --> 00:02:27,300
Consort of the Lord of North Liang

28
00:02:28,525 --> 00:02:30,025
was assassinated in the capital?

29
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,340
Though she was badly wounded,

30
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,900
she managed to leave alive.

31
00:02:34,025 --> 00:02:35,625
Without that assassination,

32
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,580
she wouldn't have died young.

33
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,350
It's such a big incident.

34
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,940
Why has it been so secret?

35
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,020
People succeed by keeping things secret

36
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,300
and fail by giving them away.

37
00:02:46,825 --> 00:02:48,460
Just because it's a big incident,

38
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,180
it has been kept secret.

39
00:02:53,525 --> 00:02:54,700
She was assassinated in the capital.

40
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,850
Was it an order from the late emperor?

41
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,140
Yes, or who would dare to do that?

42
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,900
Liyang was just founded at that time.

43
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,050
Why did the late emperor
try to kill Wu Su?

44
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,350
Xu Xiao made incomparable contributions

45
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:12,700
by destroying six states.

46
00:03:12,975 --> 00:03:14,020
No award was big enough for him.

47
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:16,260
Just at that time,

48
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,000
the late emperor was told
that Wu Su was pregnant.

49
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,740
Before that,

50
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,225
Xu Xiao only had daughters.

51
00:03:24,225 --> 00:03:25,750
There wasn't any problem.

52
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,700
But if he had an inheritor
for North Liang,

53
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,340
many people

54
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,200
would be sleepless.

55
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,150
Now that Wu Su wasn't dead,

56
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,820
why didn't Xu Xiao rebel?

57
00:03:41,175 --> 00:03:43,220
The royal family has been anxious
for several years

58
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,740
and this is

59
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,980
what confuses them.

60
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,660
She was assassinated and wounded.

61
00:03:51,475 --> 00:03:52,740
But after she was back in North Liang,

62
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,580
she didn't tell me about it.

63
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,820
I was quite bad-tempered at that time.

64
00:04:00,175 --> 00:04:01,540
If I had known that,

65
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:04,055
I would fight against the royal family.

66
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,340
When did you know that, then?

67
00:04:10,275 --> 00:04:11,915
After she gave birth to Huangman'er.

68
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,775
I didn't get to know the truth

69
00:04:15,525 --> 00:04:17,025
until her wound re-emerged.

70
00:04:17,225 --> 00:04:18,475
But at that time,

71
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,620
I had my sons and daughters.

72
00:04:21,975 --> 00:04:24,020
You know, when a man with a family

73
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:24,980
makes a choice,

74
00:04:25,225 --> 00:04:26,750
he has a lot to consider.

75
00:04:28,175 --> 00:04:29,660
She knew me best.

76
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,025
In case I restarted wars,

77
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,220
she didn't tell me the truth

78
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:35,940
until her last breath.

79
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,980
Throughout my life,

80
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,020
she always knew how to restrain me.

81
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,150
Her Grace was quite well-intentioned.

82
00:04:50,825 --> 00:04:51,980
I promised her

83
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,600
that I wouldn't start wars for her.

84
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,750
But I never said
that I wouldn't take revenge.

85
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,260
She didn't tell me

86
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,740
who assassinated her.

87
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,975
Then I've kept investigating.

88
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,775
No matter who assassinated her,

89
00:05:07,325 --> 00:05:09,100
I wouldn't let him go.

90
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Yang Taisui,

91
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,550
I'm telling you this

92
00:05:16,575 --> 00:05:19,125
because I want you
to know how determined I am.

93
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,525
Now,

94
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,060
tell me who did that.

95
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,925
Wang Xianzhi…

96
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,400
…appeared in the capital that night.

97
00:05:36,275 --> 00:05:38,200
Wang Xianzhi in Wudi City?

98
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,060
I didn't want to tell you that,

99
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,820
because I always found it fishy.

100
00:05:48,275 --> 00:05:51,180
Her Grace had excellent swordsmanship.

101
00:05:51,475 --> 00:05:53,450
But she wasn't able

102
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,100
to flee from Wang Xianzhi.

103
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,550
Only three or four swordsmen

104
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,750
are able to fight Wang Xianzhi.

105
00:06:03,425 --> 00:06:06,980
If Wang Xianzhi had fought Her Grace,

106
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,580
she wouldn't be able
to leave the capital alive.

107
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:15,750
One more thing.

108
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:17,980
I was just informed.

109
00:06:18,525 --> 00:06:21,820
As soon as His Highness decided
to visit Wudi City,

110
00:06:22,225 --> 00:06:23,750
I was told

111
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,775
that Wang Xianzhi appeared that night.

112
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,540
What a coincidence!

113
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,125
Is it true or false?

114
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,500
I had it confirmed. It's true.

115
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:41,475
The one who informed you

116
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,450
expected me to rush to Wudi City.

117
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,900
It would be better
if Wang Xianzhi killed me.

118
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,540
Then,

119
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:50,260
everybody would be satisfied.

120
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,350
I'm glad you understand that.

121
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,600
Do you have pigeons
that can fly to Jiangnan?

122
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,460
Lend one to me.

123
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,740
Fengnian is going to Wudi City, anyway.

124
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,375
He can ask Wang Xianzhi personally.

125
00:07:08,275 --> 00:07:09,875
Wang Xianzhi

126
00:07:10,675 --> 00:07:12,100
is quite moody.

127
00:07:12,575 --> 00:07:13,900
But His Highness is...

128
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,800
Domineering.

129
00:07:15,775 --> 00:07:16,800
I'm afraid

130
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,525
His Highness will be hurt.

131
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:22,220
You don't understand.

132
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,170
If I didn't tell him about this,

133
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,580
he would hate me.

134
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,350
In his heart,

135
00:07:32,075 --> 00:07:33,525
he could never get over

136
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,225
the death of his mother.

137
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,050
If you can't leave Mount Longhu,

138
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,500
I've got another plan.

139
00:07:57,075 --> 00:07:58,300
Xu Fengnian and his men

140
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,980
will pass Mount Longhu

141
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,340
to visit his brother Xu Longxiang.

142
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,000
I'll lure him here

143
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,660
so that you can kill him.

144
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,740
I'm not sure

145
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,725
whether I can defeat Li Chungang.

146
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,350
Is he really that horrible?

147
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,260
Besides,

148
00:08:15,425 --> 00:08:17,460
we can't kill Xu Fengnian.

149
00:08:18,575 --> 00:08:21,750
Liyang is too weak to get over
the rebellion of North Liang.

150
00:08:23,225 --> 00:08:24,825
Xu Fengnian

151
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,100
keeps his talent under wraps.

152
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:29,580
He's never a real playboy.

153
00:08:29,825 --> 00:08:30,500
Mm.

154
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:33,020
If he takes over North Liang,

155
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,460
he'll be a big threat.

156
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,260
We can't kill him,

157
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,275
but we can destroy him.

158
00:08:42,575 --> 00:08:43,660
How?

159
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,700
Look.

160
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,460
There's a rock.

161
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,625
Remove it.

162
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,875
Open it and read.

163
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,050
Biography of Wu Su?

164
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,550
(Biography of Wu Su)
What can it be used for?

165
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,820
When I want to control someone,

166
00:09:07,975 --> 00:09:09,025
the most important thing

167
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,540
is to disturb him.

168
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,580
You were shocked by the imperial seal

169
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,675
so that you had a dream quickly.

170
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,140
Because in your heart,

171
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,200
you care about imperial power most.

172
00:09:25,025 --> 00:09:26,400
As for Xu Fengnian...

173
00:09:26,825 --> 00:09:28,380
I've read

174
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,675
about his experiences.

175
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,940
It's easy to tell from the details

176
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,885
that Wu Su is precious

177
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,660
in his heart.

178
00:09:39,775 --> 00:09:41,340
So, this biography

179
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,200
will easily disturb Xu Fengnian.

180
00:09:44,225 --> 00:09:44,775
Mm.

181
00:09:45,675 --> 00:09:47,250
Words aren't enough.

182
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,025
(Biography of Wu Su)
On some pieces of paper,

183
00:09:49,025 --> 00:09:50,940
(Biography of Wu Su)
there are special patterns.

184
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,380
I don't need

185
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,220
to use this skill by myself.

186
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,860
The patterns

187
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,980
will influence a man's emotions

188
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,380
without being noticed.

189
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:06,125
Why do I feel nothing when reading it?

190
00:10:06,725 --> 00:10:07,940
This is designed

191
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,060
for Xu Fengnian only.

192
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,780
Others won't be influenced.

193
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,980
For him only?

194
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,820
I have to know
the detailed life of a man

195
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,140
before I design the patterns

196
00:10:19,175 --> 00:10:21,180
that can influence him

197
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,940
and hurt his emotions secretly.

198
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,820
After Xu Fengnian reads it,
he'll have a nightmare?

199
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,660
No.

200
00:10:28,775 --> 00:10:30,660
It'll get him stuck in memories.

201
00:10:31,075 --> 00:10:34,200
In his dream, he'll see the one
he's eager to see.

202
00:10:34,975 --> 00:10:35,950
How can a dream

203
00:10:36,975 --> 00:10:38,260
hurt him?

204
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,075
I'll destroy Wu Su in his heart.

205
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,900
The assassination in the capital

206
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,220
is recorded on the previous page.

207
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,200
(Biography of Wu Su)
It's very important to Xu Fengnian.

208
00:10:49,325 --> 00:10:50,820
When he reads this,

209
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,940
he'll feel the most disturbed.

210
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,900
When he suddenly sees this picture,

211
00:10:55,425 --> 00:10:57,820
he'll be deeply impressed.

212
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,075
And then?

213
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,650
Then, he'll get into his dream.

214
00:11:01,825 --> 00:11:03,325
The dragon in this picture

215
00:11:03,325 --> 00:11:05,100
will flash in his heart

216
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,380
and cut off his reliance.

217
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,940
In other words,

218
00:11:09,425 --> 00:11:10,675
I'll make Wu Su

219
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,220
die again in front of his eyes.

220
00:11:14,825 --> 00:11:16,475
Xu Fengnian will break down

221
00:11:16,775 --> 00:11:19,700
unless he's super strong mentally.

222
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,700
He may become insane as well.

223
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,860
When Xu Fengnian becomes
the Lord of North Liang

224
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,940
as an insane man,

225
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,700
isn't it the best result

226
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,540
for the royal family?

227
00:11:39,975 --> 00:11:41,780
What if he's super strong mentally?

228
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,150
One man in a million

229
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,900
can be super strong mentally.

230
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,660
Xu Fengnian can't be.

231
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,340
You've been preparing for this?

232
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,625
Even if I spend my life
in the mountains,

233
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,550
I'm from the royal family,

234
00:11:59,575 --> 00:12:00,925
after all.

235
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,775
I'm leaving immediately

236
00:12:20,775 --> 00:12:21,980
and I'll have this big present

237
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,900
sent to Xu Fengnian.

238
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,600
If Xu Fengnian gets over it,

239
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,875
bring him here!

240
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,220
Here's your decoction, My Lady.

241
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:45,925
Put more sugar in it.

242
00:12:45,925 --> 00:12:46,600
Mm.

243
00:12:50,075 --> 00:12:51,325
I'm scared of bitterness.

244
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,900
What disease do you have?

245
00:12:52,925 --> 00:12:53,900
You keep drinking the decoction
every day.

246
00:12:57,525 --> 00:12:58,450
Touch my hand.

247
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,375
I'm weak.

248
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:07,850
Even in summer,
my hands and feet are cold.

249
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,580
I'm often out of spirits.

250
00:13:11,675 --> 00:13:13,460
You need to see a good doctor.

251
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:14,860
They can't help.

252
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,950
I've seen doctors.

253
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,940
Even famous doctors say

254
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,580
that the deficiency of spirit

255
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,150
can't be cured.

256
00:13:22,825 --> 00:13:23,580
Sister,

257
00:13:24,525 --> 00:13:26,225
go back to North Liang with me.

258
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,775
Didn't we make a deal on that?

259
00:13:31,925 --> 00:13:33,300
I have to stay.

260
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:33,900
But Sister...

261
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,825
Enough.

262
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,125
How about this?

263
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,300
When you take over North Liang,

264
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,725
come and take me home.

265
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,260
Sure.

266
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,325
It's a deal, then.

267
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,775
All right.

268
00:13:49,025 --> 00:13:50,265
Forget it.

269
00:13:51,575 --> 00:13:53,400
Now that you're nearly recovered,

270
00:13:54,175 --> 00:13:55,200
think about

271
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,100
how to fall out
with scholars in Jiangnan

272
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,700
so that the royal family
will be relieved.

273
00:13:59,525 --> 00:14:01,180
I must be patient.

274
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,780
I need a chance.

275
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,860
What chance?

276
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,550
Scholars in Jiangnan
often have gatherings.

277
00:14:07,725 --> 00:14:09,900
I'll break in and make a scene.

278
00:14:10,325 --> 00:14:12,100
The scholars will hate me

279
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,820
and I'll be rude and proud.

280
00:14:13,975 --> 00:14:14,940
I can have it both ways.

281
00:14:16,725 --> 00:14:18,780
But you can't always debase yourself.

282
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,100
Like you said,

283
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:22,420
I don't care

284
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,660
how irrelevant people think of me.

285
00:14:24,575 --> 00:14:26,135
All I need is your understanding.

286
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,050
My Lady.

287
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,150
Grandpa Wei.

288
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,950
She has come again.

289
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,950
Where's she?

290
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,660
Outside the door.

291
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,500
She's waiting for you, I guess.

292
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,420
Shall I...?

293
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,550
Shall I expel her?

294
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,750
Sister, I'll go have a look.

295
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,600
All right.

296
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,100
You killer!

297
00:15:07,275 --> 00:15:08,375
I'm going to kill you!

298
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,140
Want to kill me?

299
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,500
I killed Liu Liting,

300
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,975
because he deserved it.

301
00:15:22,575 --> 00:15:23,575
I don't regret it.

302
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,125
You hate me for sure.

303
00:15:26,275 --> 00:15:27,250
I understand that.

304
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,275
Your family is powerful.

305
00:15:29,275 --> 00:15:30,900
You killed my husband on the street,

306
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,700
but no one of the local government

307
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,500
dared to take up the case!

308
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm not proud of that.

309
00:15:35,575 --> 00:15:37,900
When laws are partial to noble people,

310
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:39,700
I'm very disappointed.

311
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:42,740
To report what you did,

312
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,500
I've sent a letter to the capital.

313
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,940
It won't be a few days

314
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,675
before you get what you deserve.

315
00:15:48,525 --> 00:15:50,975
You sent the letter to the consort
of your clan, right?

316
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,575
I was just informed

317
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,950
that she fell in disfavor.

318
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,100
Nonsense!

319
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,550
Why would I talk nonsense about that?

320
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,050
I'm more well-informed than you.

321
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,110
In a couple of days,

322
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,460
you'll be informed, too.

323
00:16:07,025 --> 00:16:08,375
Why would that happen?

324
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,220
The reason is easy.

325
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,825
Because His Majesty doesn't want
to fall out with North Liang

326
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,420
just for you.

327
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,260
I feel sorry about that, too.

328
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,700
I killed Liu Liting
for the right reason.

329
00:16:20,975 --> 00:16:22,380
I was waiting to confront you at court

330
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,800
and vindicate my sister.

331
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,575
I didn't expect the government

332
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,300
to hold down the case directly.

333
00:16:28,275 --> 00:16:30,850
It's quite disappointing.

334
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,275
Keep showing off.

335
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,900
One day,

336
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,460
your crimes will be inexpiable!

337
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,420
I'm not showing off or satirizing you.

338
00:16:39,675 --> 00:16:41,300
I really mean that.

339
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,980
I also don't think

340
00:16:43,075 --> 00:16:44,500
it's evil to kill Liu Liting.

341
00:16:45,725 --> 00:16:47,675
It was his plot

342
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,220
to kill my sister by the hand of rites.

343
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,925
Nonsense!

344
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,100
This is all I can tell you.

345
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,200
I'm going to say no more.

346
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,340
Don't come again.

347
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,380
You can't kill me.

348
00:17:22,225 --> 00:17:25,375
Even if I die, I won't let you go!

349
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,100
She was deceived by Liu Liting.

350
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,025
She shouldn't be killed for that.

351
00:17:34,075 --> 00:17:35,775
But I'm afraid she will try to kill you

352
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,940
from this day on.

353
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,140
She wouldn't want to live on,

354
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:42,025
without hatred.

355
00:17:46,675 --> 00:17:47,595
Master,

356
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
Liu Liting's wife has come again.

357
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,580
Liu Liting used many schemes

358
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,100
to debase our family.

359
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,975
He deserved to be killed.

360
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,900
Xu Fengnian went out to see her.

361
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,325
Is he going to kill her?

362
00:18:01,575 --> 00:18:02,800
No.

363
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,275
He said something to her

364
00:18:04,275 --> 00:18:05,725
and then she left.

365
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:08,730
Keep an eye on him.

366
00:18:09,425 --> 00:18:12,020
Don't let him kill her.

367
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:12,900
Yes.

368
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,125
Also,

369
00:18:15,525 --> 00:18:16,575
tell my family members

370
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,375
not to be harsh on Xu Zhihu.

371
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,420
She's a poor lady, too.

372
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,975
You make sense.

373
00:18:24,175 --> 00:18:24,775
Someone...

374
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,625
Just say it.

375
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:32,340
A maid in the backyard saw

376
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,820
that Xu Fengnian brought two girls here.

377
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,250
She said,

378
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,475
one of the girls

379
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,500
might be from West Chu.

380
00:18:47,075 --> 00:18:48,060
What you asked for the other day

381
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,580
has been handled.

382
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,860
The carriage is near the back door.

383
00:18:51,225 --> 00:18:52,460
No one in the Lu Family saw it.

384
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:53,650
Shall we

385
00:18:54,775 --> 00:18:55,575
go have a look?

386
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,600
Master.

387
00:19:02,425 --> 00:19:03,600
The other day,

388
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,020
when I gave the monthly pay
to Xu Zhihu...

389
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,050
Call her Young Mistress.

390
00:19:08,025 --> 00:19:08,740
Right, right.

391
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,820
When I gave the monthly pay
to Young Mistress,

392
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,780
I ran into the two girls

393
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,140
brought by Xu Fengnian.

394
00:19:17,075 --> 00:19:19,795
They were wearing the veil.

395
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,620
I thought about one of them these days

396
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,860
and I found her familiar.

397
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,580
You think she's from West Chu?

398
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:27,620
Yes.

399
00:19:28,925 --> 00:19:30,060
You've met people from West Chu?

400
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:31,875
Yes.

401
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,550
The Eldest Master once visited West Chu.

402
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,900
I accompanied him and took care of him.

403
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,825
Get to the point.

404
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,260
The royal family of West Chu
held a banquet for us.

405
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,220
A swordswoman performed a sword dance.

406
00:19:47,175 --> 00:19:49,260
The girl around Xu Fengnian

407
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,550
looks like that swordswoman

408
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:54,140
in appearance and temperament.

409
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,475
You simply judge her

410
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,800
by appearance?

411
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,125
When I was watching the sword dance
in the corridor,

412
00:20:04,425 --> 00:20:05,700
I saw a little girl of West Chu

413
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,540
standing among the servants.

414
00:20:07,925 --> 00:20:09,650
She was watching the dance, too.

415
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,225
I remember clearly

416
00:20:11,475 --> 00:20:14,200
that she was holding a little white cat.

417
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,500
The girl around Xu Fengnian

418
00:20:17,825 --> 00:20:19,450
holds a white cat, too.

419
00:20:21,075 --> 00:20:23,300
And they look alike.

420
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,750
Isn't it a coincidence?

421
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,775
It doesn't make sense.

422
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,540
Xu Xiao destroyed West Chu.

423
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,820
Why would a descendant of West Chu

424
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,900
stay around Xu Fengnian?

425
00:20:37,225 --> 00:20:38,100
Besides,

426
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,340
Xu Xiao knows

427
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,420
my family hates West Chu.

428
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,580
Why would Xu Fengnian
bring such a girl to Jiangnan?

429
00:20:46,075 --> 00:20:46,800
Go.

430
00:20:47,425 --> 00:20:48,500
Take me to check the place

431
00:20:48,825 --> 00:20:50,375
where the girls live.

432
00:20:53,175 --> 00:20:54,250
The girls

433
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,925
used to live here.

434
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,780
Their luggage is gone.

435
00:20:58,775 --> 00:20:59,700
Go ask about it.

436
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,340
Yes.

437
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:15,100
Why must we move out without a reason?

438
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,460
It's an order from His Highness.

439
00:21:17,575 --> 00:21:19,540
Why doesn't he move out?

440
00:21:20,525 --> 00:21:22,050
I'm not scared of the Lu Family.

441
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,225
Your Highness.

442
00:21:25,925 --> 00:21:28,050
Why am I scared of the Lu Family?

443
00:21:29,275 --> 00:21:31,060
The lineal son of the Lu Family
joined the army

444
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,420
and died in the battle against West Chu.

445
00:21:32,575 --> 00:21:34,750
So, they hate you greatly.

446
00:21:36,025 --> 00:21:37,540
But it was a long time ago.

447
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,340
Why are you as nagging as Yu Youwei?

448
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:41,500
What?

449
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,850
I thought about it carefully.

450
00:21:43,175 --> 00:21:45,020
Xu Xiao has never
done anything unnecessary.

451
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,420
What's your point?

452
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,300
He looks casual in doing anything.

453
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,400
But he always has a perfect plan
with secret meanings.

454
00:21:52,075 --> 00:21:53,540
Since Lyu Qiantang died,

455
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,900
I've been thinking about one question.

456
00:21:55,725 --> 00:21:56,980
Why did he ask you and Yu Youwei

457
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:59,000
to go east with me?

458
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,580
Why do you think?

459
00:22:03,425 --> 00:22:04,860
For the inheritance of North Liang.

460
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,740
Xu Xiao wants me to fall out
with the Lu Family.

461
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:08,780
But he knows me.

462
00:22:09,025 --> 00:22:10,350
I won't embarrass my sister.

463
00:22:12,425 --> 00:22:13,865
Let's assume this.

464
00:22:14,325 --> 00:22:16,085
If the Lu Family recognizes you

465
00:22:16,225 --> 00:22:17,620
or Yu Youwei,

466
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,660
what will happen?

467
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:22,575
They'll kill us for revenge.

468
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:24,580
Then, I'll fall out with them.

469
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,420
His plan to make me inherit
the throne of North Liang

470
00:22:27,225 --> 00:22:28,325
will be working.

471
00:22:29,475 --> 00:22:30,580
What did I say?

472
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,220
He must have got a scheme
when he asked us to travel with you.

473
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,460
Xu Xiao always says

474
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,375
that we can pay any price
to achieve what we want.

475
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,660
During this trip,

476
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,825
you're the price to pay, I'm afraid.

477
00:22:44,675 --> 00:22:47,375
Why didn't you let us leave until today?

478
00:22:47,975 --> 00:22:49,300
I didn't figure out this secret plan

479
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,460
until I stayed for recuperation
these days.

480
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,300
No matter whether it's Xu Xiao's scheme,

481
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,220
you must be very careful.

482
00:22:54,225 --> 00:22:55,125
I've asked Fengzi Battalion

483
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:55,980
to find a shelter for you.

484
00:22:56,225 --> 00:22:57,375
Hide yourselves for the moment.

485
00:22:58,025 --> 00:22:59,500
After we leave Jiangnan together,

486
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,060
everything will go smoothly.

487
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:08,375
Master,

488
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:09,500
I asked about it.

489
00:23:09,575 --> 00:23:10,875
They just moved out.

490
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,300
If they were clean,

491
00:23:17,075 --> 00:23:18,300
why would Xu Fengnian

492
00:23:18,575 --> 00:23:20,575
let them move out of my mansion?

493
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,025
Looks like

494
00:23:23,225 --> 00:23:25,575
there's something fishy with them.

495
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:27,860
Shall we

496
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,580
get them back and recognize them?

497
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,100
No one shall bring it up again.

498
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,550
Are we just letting them go?

499
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,575
If they're indeed from West Chu,

500
00:23:37,025 --> 00:23:38,850
they have a blood feud with us.

501
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,700
We can't have a direct conflict
with them.

502
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,100
Someone has to recognize them.

503
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,725
But it can't be anyone

504
00:23:49,575 --> 00:23:50,800
from my family.

505
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,275
Master,

506
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:54,075
what's your plan, then?

507
00:24:04,825 --> 00:24:05,950
I need your help

508
00:24:06,575 --> 00:24:07,775
with a scheme.

509
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,925
Your family and North Liang
are birds of a feather.

510
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:15,980
What?

511
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,420
Killing my husband isn't enough?

512
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,175
What if

513
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,325
it's a scheme against Xu Fengnian?

514
00:24:27,225 --> 00:24:28,375
That's impossible.

515
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,300
You are relatives by marriage.

516
00:24:31,575 --> 00:24:32,350
Right.

517
00:24:33,425 --> 00:24:34,775
We're relatives by marriage.

518
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:37,020
I've been kind

519
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,140
to Xu Zhihu, too.

520
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,300
However,

521
00:24:41,075 --> 00:24:43,540
if they cross the line of my family,

522
00:24:44,925 --> 00:24:46,020
I won't be nice anymore.

523
00:24:47,775 --> 00:24:49,375
Your husband died.

524
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,020
My brother died, too.

525
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,300
Many things

526
00:24:55,025 --> 00:24:56,060
won't be let go

527
00:24:57,425 --> 00:24:58,780
even after many years.

528
00:25:02,825 --> 00:25:03,850
What scheme?

529
00:25:30,275 --> 00:25:32,300
Don't go out these days.

530
00:25:32,425 --> 00:25:34,585
If they want to find us,
they will find us.

531
00:25:35,675 --> 00:25:37,195
Why is the Lu Family looking for you?

532
00:25:37,775 --> 00:25:39,020
You're mere maids.

533
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,925
If Xu Xiao wants to give me
to the Lu Family,

534
00:25:42,475 --> 00:25:43,725
moving won't help at all.

535
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,510
His Highness will protect you.

536
00:25:50,075 --> 00:25:50,980
What about you?

537
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,200
If Xu Xiao also gives you an order,

538
00:25:53,325 --> 00:25:54,425
whose order will you take?

539
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,900
Dregs of West Chu?

540
00:25:56,475 --> 00:25:57,550
I'm not sure yet.

541
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,420
I must find them

542
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,100
and interrogate them.

543
00:26:01,325 --> 00:26:02,820
What do you want me for?

544
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,140
In Yangcheng,

545
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,980
you can find anyone you want.

546
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,900
Yes, if we have many people
look for them.

547
00:26:10,075 --> 00:26:11,100
But if we make a big thing of it,

548
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,260
how will we end up?

549
00:26:14,475 --> 00:26:16,000
You're scared of North Liang?

550
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,100
There are 350,000 soldiers
in North Liang Army.

551
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:19,780
Who isn't scared?

552
00:26:20,225 --> 00:26:22,140
Before I confirm who the two maids are,

553
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,250
I can't fall out with them.

554
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,050
You want me to find them for you?

555
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,275
No.

556
00:26:27,475 --> 00:26:29,000
What do you want, then?

557
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:31,750
I want you

558
00:26:32,075 --> 00:26:33,460
to hold a debate.

559
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,580
Invite all scholars in Jiangnan,

560
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,780
except for my family.

561
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,300
Where shall I hold it?

562
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,340
In Baoguo Temple.

563
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,250
As for the time...

564
00:26:46,825 --> 00:26:47,780
Let's make it

565
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,340
in five days.

566
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,060
Where are you going?

567
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,260
I'll keep going east.

568
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,180
We're going to visit Huangman'er
on Mount Longhu

569
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,150
and visit my second eldest sister
in Shangyin Academy.

570
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,775
But you're still wounded.

571
00:26:59,775 --> 00:27:00,925
It has recovered.

572
00:27:01,325 --> 00:27:02,425
After two changes of dressing,

573
00:27:02,425 --> 00:27:04,460
I can leave in four or five days.

574
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:08,050
Sister, if you don't want me to leave,

575
00:27:08,425 --> 00:27:09,650
go with me.

576
00:27:10,825 --> 00:27:13,020
I'm married and I can't leave.

577
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,340
When you take over North Liang,

578
00:27:15,725 --> 00:27:17,100
come and take me home.

579
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,375
We made the deal, didn't we?

580
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,300
Wait for me, then.

581
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,100
Mm.

582
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,260
Do remember

583
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,340
to make a scene in Jiangnan

584
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,620
before you leave.

585
00:27:29,175 --> 00:27:31,525
Only in this way will the royal family
let you inherit North Liang.

586
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:32,140
Don't worry.

587
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,460
My men are asking about
the literary gathering

588
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,740
in recent days.

589
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,625
And Jiang Ni...

590
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,180
Be very careful.

591
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,260
Don't let the Lu Family
know her identity.

592
00:27:44,325 --> 00:27:45,860
I won't let her
come to the Lu Family anymore.

593
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,620
West Chu has been destroyed.

594
00:27:54,025 --> 00:27:56,380
Otherwise, Jiang Ni would be
good enough for you

595
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,660
considering she was the princess.

596
00:27:58,375 --> 00:27:59,740
What are you talking about?

597
00:28:00,475 --> 00:28:02,175
I understand even if you never say it.

598
00:28:02,475 --> 00:28:03,700
In your heart,

599
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,800
Jiang Ni is different from other girls.

600
00:28:06,775 --> 00:28:08,750
But I'm afraid

601
00:28:09,725 --> 00:28:11,600
Father has an arrangement
for your marriage.

602
00:28:12,475 --> 00:28:13,800
I don't think

603
00:28:14,175 --> 00:28:15,975
Jiang Ni can marry you.

604
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,500
Xu Xiao can't arrange my marriage.

605
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,580
It's my life

606
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,420
and I pick my own wife.

607
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:22,225
You've been at odds
with Father since you were little.

608
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:23,375
I can't do anything to change that.

609
00:28:23,775 --> 00:28:24,660
He and I just don't get along.

610
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,475
Nonsense!

611
00:28:25,675 --> 00:28:27,050
You're father and son.

612
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,420
Fengnian,

613
00:28:31,525 --> 00:28:33,100
you can't blame Father

614
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,425
for Mother's death.

615
00:28:34,425 --> 00:28:35,740
Say no more about it.

616
00:28:37,575 --> 00:28:38,660
You haven't let it go,

617
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,200
have you?

618
00:28:41,475 --> 00:28:42,740
It's been so many years.

619
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,420
Look.

620
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,680
I'm all right.

621
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:54,825
(Cries of Crane)

622
00:29:06,225 --> 00:29:07,075
Senior.

623
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:09,700
Mm.

624
00:29:11,225 --> 00:29:12,350
You've put away

625
00:29:12,525 --> 00:29:13,500
the Divine Token?

626
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,425
Or what?

627
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,075
Shall I wear it so that
the Lu Family will recognize me?

628
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,100
So,

629
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,700
you've been on alert.

630
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,140
Did Xu Fengnian

631
00:29:21,275 --> 00:29:22,750
ask you to remind me?

632
00:29:24,575 --> 00:29:25,975
His Lordship

633
00:29:26,225 --> 00:29:27,400
wants a favor from you.

634
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,980
Xu Xiao?

635
00:29:34,075 --> 00:29:35,700
His Lordship is working

636
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:36,860
on what he promised you.

637
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,425
Please rest assured.

638
00:29:39,975 --> 00:29:41,980
Xu Xiao sent you a message
from the capital?

639
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:43,850
Nowadays,

640
00:29:44,175 --> 00:29:45,725
everyone keeps some pigeons.

641
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,660
Does Xu Fengnian know that?

642
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,575
Looks like he doesn't.

643
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:56,950
What does Xu Xiao want?

644
00:30:01,275 --> 00:30:02,315
His Lordship

645
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:04,500
wants to borrow something from you.

646
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:08,500
This?

647
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,175
(Yangcheng)

648
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,400
(Cries of Crane)

649
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,125
It's you, Mr. Wei?

650
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,460
Why haven't I seen you these days?

651
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,650
I've been running around,

652
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:41,175
to get information for His Highness.

653
00:30:41,275 --> 00:30:42,050
Look.

654
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,275
I've got something to report to him.

655
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,725
I think

656
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,825
His Highness is in Lady Zhihu's room.

657
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,275
Go ahead.

658
00:30:52,525 --> 00:30:55,025
Were you talking to the God of Sword?

659
00:31:03,775 --> 00:31:05,275
Why did you ask?

660
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,875
Do you think

661
00:31:08,775 --> 00:31:09,950
he will instruct me?

662
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:14,900
Instruct you?

663
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,800
He's the God of Sword.

664
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:18,550
If he can instruct me,

665
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,140
I'll get a lot of benefits.

666
00:31:21,225 --> 00:31:22,375
You have to

667
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:24,800
ask him by yourself.

668
00:31:25,325 --> 00:31:26,580
I don't dare to.

669
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,400
The God of Sword

670
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:30,900
is said to be like an immortal.

671
00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:33,700
But Mr. Wei,

672
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:35,700
you're familiar with him.

673
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:36,820
You get it wrong.

674
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,425
I'm not familiar with him.

675
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,000
We weren't talking, either.

676
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,260
I was just borrowing something

677
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,180
from him.

678
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,175
Borrowing something?

679
00:31:43,175 --> 00:31:43,825
Mm.

680
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:45,275
What is it?

681
00:31:47,775 --> 00:31:49,075
You have something to tell His Highness,

682
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:51,125
don't you?

683
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,620
I'm going out

684
00:31:53,275 --> 00:31:54,700
for a stroll on the street.

685
00:32:05,025 --> 00:32:07,150
(Cries of Crane)

686
00:32:09,775 --> 00:32:12,300
(Mansion of Lu)

687
00:32:44,675 --> 00:32:45,875
What's in the box?

688
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:48,175
You stabbed Xu Fengnian?

689
00:32:49,575 --> 00:32:51,225
Unfortunately, he isn't dead yet.

690
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,675
If you really want to kill Xu Fengnian,

691
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,150
we can cooperate.

692
00:32:59,575 --> 00:33:00,620
I don't want it.

693
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,900
If you want the money reward,

694
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,860
I can give it all to you.

695
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,500
After we make it,

696
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,980
I can even give you more money.

697
00:33:10,475 --> 00:33:11,380
I don't believe you.

698
00:33:11,525 --> 00:33:12,575
What do you want, then?

699
00:33:12,725 --> 00:33:14,725
Xu Fengnian is my prey.

700
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:16,940
No one else can touch him.

701
00:33:22,475 --> 00:33:24,540
It's overbearing of you.

702
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,420
Shall we have a fight?

703
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:32,600
After he leaves Yangcheng,

704
00:33:34,025 --> 00:33:35,000
you and I

705
00:33:36,275 --> 00:33:37,700
shall take action separately.

706
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:41,825
Wait.

707
00:33:41,825 --> 00:33:43,900
You haven't told me what's in the box.

708
00:33:54,475 --> 00:33:55,550
Bear it.

709
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:56,900
It's bitter.

710
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,075
But you have to drink it every day.

711
00:33:58,650 --> 00:33:59,420
Your Highness.

712
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:00,950
Come on in.

713
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,125
My Lady.

714
00:34:08,675 --> 00:34:09,420
What's up?

715
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:10,500
Your Highness,

716
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:12,540
there's a rumor in the town

717
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,150
that a debate will be held soon.

718
00:34:14,425 --> 00:34:16,180
Celebrities of Jiangnan will attend it.

719
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:21,050
The Lu Family isn't invited?

720
00:34:25,275 --> 00:34:26,140
Answer me.

721
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,475
It'll be held by Liu Liting's wife.

722
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,660
She has invited all scholars,

723
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,725
except for the Lu Family.

724
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,200
She said

725
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,600
that the Lu Family had a bad reputation

726
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,275
and wasn't qualified
to lead scholars of Jiangnan.

727
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:38,525
She scolded me too, didn't she?

728
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:40,660
Where will it be held?

729
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,250
In Baoguo Temple.

730
00:34:42,575 --> 00:34:43,860
What's the topic of the debate?

731
00:34:44,475 --> 00:34:45,925
About the reign of kings.

732
00:34:46,775 --> 00:34:47,740
Good topic.

733
00:34:47,925 --> 00:34:49,675
Will Xu Fengnian really come?

734
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,075
Xu Xiao is in the capital now.

735
00:34:52,225 --> 00:34:53,020
What?

736
00:34:53,325 --> 00:34:55,100
His Majesty hasn't seen him yet.

737
00:34:56,775 --> 00:34:58,860
What does it have to do
with Xu Fengnian?

738
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:01,860
Do you know why Xu Fengnian
came to Jiangnan?

739
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,660
To see his shameless sister.

740
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,900
He came to make trouble.

741
00:35:06,975 --> 00:35:07,820
Don't worry.

742
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,620
In the debate in Baoguo Temple,

743
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,685
Xu Fengnian will appear.

744
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,625
Your Highness.

745
00:35:30,575 --> 00:35:31,500
Get out of town tomorrow.

746
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,475
We're leaving?

747
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,900
Qingniao will escort you out first.

748
00:35:36,225 --> 00:35:37,620
Let's meet in Baoguo Temple
out of the town.

749
00:35:37,975 --> 00:35:38,940
Are we going there for burning incense?

750
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,740
For a quarrel.

751
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:43,260
Come in with me for a talk.

752
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,500
What's wrong?

753
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,500
Don't let them hear us.

754
00:36:12,975 --> 00:36:13,700
It's all right.

755
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,300
Wait in the yard.

756
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,050
We're alone now.

757
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:29,000
Do you remember the day

758
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,900
when my mother died?

759
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:33,980
Yes.

760
00:36:39,825 --> 00:36:41,350
(Memorial)

761
00:36:43,775 --> 00:36:46,875
(Tablet of Wife Wu Su)

762
00:37:04,275 --> 00:37:06,340
She'll always live in your heart,

763
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,775
watching you.

764
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:09,340
Wipe your tears.

765
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,940
Don't let her see you cry.

766
00:37:20,925 --> 00:37:22,375
You told me

767
00:37:23,725 --> 00:37:25,580
that my mother would live in my heart.

768
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,300
Since then,

769
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,540
I've never cried.

770
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,575
I tried

771
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,375
to take care of Huangman'er

772
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,540
and my sisters.

773
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,020
I wanted to protect them
on behalf of my mother

774
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,780
so that my family would not fall apart.

775
00:37:51,675 --> 00:37:54,020
But in the end, I failed.

776
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:59,225
My eldest sister
was married to Jiangnan.

777
00:38:00,025 --> 00:38:01,125
My second eldest sister

778
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,300
went to Shangyin Academy.

779
00:38:04,925 --> 00:38:07,475
Even Huangman'er was forcibly sent
to Mount Longhu.

780
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,180
My family fell apart, anyway.

781
00:38:11,575 --> 00:38:13,220
As long as you become
the Lord of North Liang,

782
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,325
you can get them back.

783
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:20,450
But I'm afraid it's too late.

784
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,850
Why?

785
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:25,525
My sister has been taking medicine.

786
00:38:28,025 --> 00:38:29,500
I worried about her

787
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:34,540
and I consulted famous doctors
in Yangcheng.

788
00:38:35,775 --> 00:38:36,875
What did they say?

789
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,305
There's no cure for her.

790
00:38:57,725 --> 00:38:58,600
My Lady,

791
00:38:59,175 --> 00:39:00,700
His Highness is leaving.

792
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:02,990
Will you not

793
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,260
tell him about your disease?

794
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:08,725
It is no use telling him.

795
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,100
Er'qiao,

796
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,475
help me to get changed.

797
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,775
What disease does she have?

798
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:25,650
According to the doctors,

799
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,100
she has an insufficiency of spirit.

800
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,260
It's a common disease.

801
00:39:30,925 --> 00:39:32,420
She just needs replenishment.

802
00:39:32,575 --> 00:39:33,625
She can't have it.

803
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,300
What does that mean?

804
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:37,850
Her spirit and strength

805
00:39:38,225 --> 00:39:40,050
are consuming faster than ordinary men.

806
00:39:41,075 --> 00:39:43,200
She's like a burning flame

807
00:39:44,575 --> 00:39:45,775
that will not stop

808
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,650
until it burns out.

809
00:39:50,775 --> 00:39:51,975
It's not an exact disease.

810
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,900
Her life

811
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,450
is just burning faster.

812
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,925
However much medicine she takes,

813
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:01,775
it can't make up for her lost energy.

814
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:05,300
It will only make her burn more brightly

815
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,750
and die faster.

816
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,025
How do I look?

817
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,875
Do I look beautiful?

818
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,400
This is my favorite dress.

819
00:40:22,775 --> 00:40:24,000
Fengnian is leaving.

820
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,540
I want to make
the best impression on him.

821
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,200
My Lady.

822
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,700
Listen.

823
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:34,100
Strength will be exhausted.

824
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:35,700
In some cases,

825
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,980
we can't find a solution.

826
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:39,725
Don't let him know.

827
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,860
I want him to leave Jiangnan
in high spirits.

828
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:44,900
All right?

829
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:47,925
Mm.

830
00:40:53,025 --> 00:40:54,675
Actually, I'm very happy

831
00:40:54,675 --> 00:40:56,325
to see Fengnian again.

832
00:40:57,775 --> 00:40:59,950
When I know he wants
to take over North Liang,

833
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,550
I'm relieved, too.

834
00:41:02,575 --> 00:41:04,140
Now, I just wish

835
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,940
I could live a bit longer

836
00:41:06,475 --> 00:41:07,940
so that I could see it

837
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,020
when Fengnian becomes
the Lord of North Liang.

838
00:41:11,225 --> 00:41:13,475
Then, I would have no regret.

839
00:41:16,525 --> 00:41:17,980
Now that my sister
doesn't want me to know,

840
00:41:21,775 --> 00:41:23,260
I just pretend I don't know.

841
00:41:26,575 --> 00:41:27,620
I had wanted

842
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,020
to take her back to North Liang.

843
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:33,475
But my sister doesn't want it.

844
00:41:35,425 --> 00:41:36,875
She thinks

845
00:41:38,225 --> 00:41:40,580
she can't help me
unless she stays in Jiangnan.

846
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,460
So, I must let her stay

847
00:41:44,525 --> 00:41:46,025
to make her happy.

848
00:41:49,575 --> 00:41:50,460
All right, then.

849
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:55,075
If it's what my sister wants,

850
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,460
I'll let her be.

851
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,460
Let's keep looking for famous doctors.

852
00:42:03,325 --> 00:42:04,380
There's hope.

853
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:07,700
I don't think doctors can't help her.

854
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,220
Who else can help her?

855
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:15,150
Li Chungang hasn't grown old
since he became famous for decades.

856
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,260
Wang Xianzhi is known
as the Second Best.

857
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,420
He's nearly 60 years old,

858
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:20,000
but he looks like a middle-aged man.

859
00:42:20,575 --> 00:42:21,780
Maybe they can help her.

860
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:24,260
I'll go see Li Chungang

861
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,460
and ask him for help.

862
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:26,940
Forget it.

863
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,600
I'm wrong about that.

864
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,975
He's the God of Sword,
instead of the God of Medicine.

865
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:41,740
I'm just

866
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,475
a little bit disturbed.

867
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:47,050
I guess

868
00:42:47,975 --> 00:42:49,900
