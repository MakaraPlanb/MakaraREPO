00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:37,975
(Capital of Liyang Official Posthouse)

8
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,020
News from Qingzhou said

9
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,220
your son was bold enough

10
00:02:00,825 --> 00:02:01,775
to run the risks

11
00:02:02,675 --> 00:02:05,180
for kidnapping Consort of Jing'an.

12
00:02:07,525 --> 00:02:09,200
I heard

13
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,650
Lord of Jing'an
smashed his Buddhist Hall in anger.

14
00:02:14,025 --> 00:02:16,275
He also hired Wang Mingyin,

15
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,900
No. 11 in the world,

16
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,425
to assassinate your son.

17
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,980
I'm impressed

18
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,380
you had Li Chungang

19
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,800
protect him.

20
00:02:29,825 --> 00:02:32,475
Your son threatened Lord of Jing'an
with his consort,

21
00:02:32,775 --> 00:02:35,325
he could do nothing except for
letting him go.

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,580
But now,

23
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,300
North Liang will

24
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,000
feud with Qingzhou.

25
00:02:45,075 --> 00:02:47,100
Lots of people hate North Liang,

26
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,380
we can take it
if Zhao Heng does it, too.

27
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:56,060
Your son

28
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,980
is preposterous.

29
00:03:00,925 --> 00:03:02,540
How do you feel about it?

30
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,500
It doesn't matter what I feel.

31
00:03:05,925 --> 00:03:07,175
It matters what

32
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,780
His Majesty feels.

33
00:03:10,975 --> 00:03:13,425
His Majesty feels pleased.

34
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,050
Well?

35
00:03:16,825 --> 00:03:18,700
In his opinion,

36
00:03:18,775 --> 00:03:20,475
such a preposterous heir

37
00:03:20,475 --> 00:03:22,875
is perfect for North Liang.

38
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,420
Then tell me

39
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,975
when His Majesty

40
00:03:33,225 --> 00:03:34,900
wants to see me?

41
00:03:35,275 --> 00:03:36,100
Be patient.

42
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,475
Wait for several more days.

43
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,820
Your son has left Qingzhou for Yuzhou.

44
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,475
He'll soon arrive at
Jiangnan of Yangzhou.

45
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:46,980
Fengnian

46
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,300
values family and friends.

47
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,500
He always wants to visit his big sister.

48
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,675
Have you heard the news

49
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,900
from Jiangnan?

50
00:03:57,075 --> 00:03:58,300
Staying in the capital,

51
00:03:58,475 --> 00:03:59,820
my eyes are blindfolded
and my ears are covered.

52
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,225
How can I know anything?

53
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,950
It's said...

54
00:04:09,525 --> 00:04:10,725
It's said that

55
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,775
your eldest daughter

56
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:16,550
is riotous in Jiangnan.

57
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,220
She has an affair with others.

58
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,550
The Lu Family has filed the suits

59
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,900
to His Majesty.

60
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,660
What a superb move!

61
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,275
Grand Commander,

62
00:04:38,425 --> 00:04:41,150
you didn't notice
the hidden danger of killing.

63
00:04:41,425 --> 00:04:42,625
You'll definitely lose

64
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,700
the game.

65
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,900
It's hopeless.

66
00:05:00,075 --> 00:05:01,100
Do you know

67
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:04,375
what kind of player
is the most difficult?

68
00:05:06,475 --> 00:05:08,000
Calculate ten steps
before he takes one step.

69
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,150
Seize the initiative
before his opponent does.

70
00:05:18,325 --> 00:05:20,875
The player that messes up the game
is the most difficult.

71
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,940
It doesn't count.
Let's play another game.

72
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,425
It's getting late. I have to go.

73
00:05:31,425 --> 00:05:32,200
You're not going.

74
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,100
Tell you what,

75
00:05:34,425 --> 00:05:36,875
if I don't have
three straight wins today,

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,275
you're not going anywhere.

77
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,525
Well...

78
00:05:39,525 --> 00:05:41,340
I've already made the bed for you.

79
00:05:41,825 --> 00:05:43,300
Amitabha.

80
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,400
- Come on.
- I...

81
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,025
- Amitabha.
- Amitabha.

82
00:05:50,025 --> 00:05:51,050
Amitabha.

83
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,052
(Maid Er'qiao)

84
00:06:28,425 --> 00:06:29,380
Lady Zhihu.

85
00:06:31,323 --> 00:06:34,050
(Eldest daughter of Lord of North Liang
Xu Zhihu)

86
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:42,980
What are you doing?

87
00:06:44,325 --> 00:06:46,025
The Lu Family has a clean
and upright reputation,

88
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,220
not expecting it to be ruined

89
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,500
by such a loose woman like you.

90
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:50,460
Xu Zhihu,

91
00:06:51,325 --> 00:06:52,950
rumors of you seducing men

92
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,740
have spread around the whole city.

93
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,260
You're indeed shameless.

94
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,150
Do you envy me?

95
00:06:58,525 --> 00:06:59,180
You...

96
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,380
You shameless slut.

97
00:07:03,675 --> 00:07:04,975
You pathetic thing.

98
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,650
No man wants you

99
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,900
even if you want to be a slut.

100
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,340
I must rip your mouth off.

101
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,180
How dare you!

102
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,660
Let go.

103
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,380
Er'qiao.

104
00:07:13,775 --> 00:07:14,580
Step aside.

105
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,500
Let go of me.

106
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:17,900
Didn't you want to rip my mouth off?

107
00:07:18,925 --> 00:07:19,660
Help yourself.

108
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,660
You don't think I dare to do so, do you?

109
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,980
I bet you dare not.

110
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,225
Will you do it or not?

111
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,675
I have a book to read.

112
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,800
It's a tragedy
to have such a woman like you

113
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,825
marry into the family.

114
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,580
Lady Zhihu,

115
00:07:44,075 --> 00:07:46,140
the Lu Family is going too far.

116
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,200
Why do you still smile?

117
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,175
Of course I'm smiling.

118
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,580
I'm in a very good mood today.

119
00:07:57,925 --> 00:07:59,460
My brother is coming to see me.

120
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,380
By my reckoning,

121
00:08:01,825 --> 00:08:03,540
it takes Fengnian two more days

122
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,350
to arrive at Yangcheng.

123
00:08:16,675 --> 00:08:18,875
(Yangcheng)

124
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,475
(Yangzhou Yangcheng)

125
00:08:20,475 --> 00:08:21,375
Here we are.

126
00:08:22,225 --> 00:08:23,260
Ask for directions to the Lu Family

127
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,125
after we get in.

128
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,100
Your Highness.

129
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,060
Should we wait for others
to catch up with us?

130
00:08:28,225 --> 00:08:29,500
I'm going to visit my sister first.

131
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,820
They can meet when they arrive.

132
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,580
Your Highness.

133
00:08:34,275 --> 00:08:35,060
What's up?

134
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,460
Mr. Li said he was hungry.

135
00:08:38,675 --> 00:08:39,450
Sure.

136
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:40,940
It was a long journey.

137
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,000
We've had a long day.

138
00:08:42,725 --> 00:08:43,700
No hurry.

139
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,780
Let's find a restaurant

140
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,250
and have a square meal

141
00:08:46,675 --> 00:08:47,800
before we visit the Lu Family.

142
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:48,700
OK.

143
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,750
(Yangcheng)

144
00:08:53,425 --> 00:08:55,700
(Yiding Restaurant)

145
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,425
Your Highness.

146
00:08:56,425 --> 00:08:57,900
I've sent my men to pick up Mr. Li.

147
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,825
They'll arrive later.

148
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,925
Let's eat first.

149
00:09:00,425 --> 00:09:01,180
All right.

150
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,175
Let's order.

151
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,225
Then we'll ask for directions.

152
00:09:11,225 --> 00:09:12,100
Yeah. OK.

153
00:09:14,475 --> 00:09:15,550
Hey, guys.

154
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,540
I heard

155
00:09:16,675 --> 00:09:17,820
the son of Lord of North Liang

156
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,950
is coming to Yangcheng

157
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,260
to visit his elder sister.

158
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,420
The brother is ignorant

159
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,300
while the sister is shameless.

160
00:09:24,425 --> 00:09:25,700
They are

161
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,025
the same kind of people.

162
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,200
I heard

163
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,460
Mr. Chengzhai's wife

164
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,600
called Xu Zhihu

165
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,225
a whore.

166
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,660
The rumors

167
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,325
have reached the capital.

168
00:09:39,225 --> 00:09:40,700
You know what,

169
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,660
a concubine in the palace

170
00:09:42,775 --> 00:09:45,675
is of the same clan
as Mr. Chengzhai's wife.

171
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,275
According to the family hierarchy,

172
00:09:47,275 --> 00:09:49,425
Mr. Chengzhai's wife
is one of her nieces.

173
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:51,800
Xu Zhihu is such a dissolute woman.

174
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,175
How could the Lu Family

175
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,725
face other people?

176
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,575
Tell me about

177
00:10:05,925 --> 00:10:07,525
the Lu Family.

178
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,300
I was just thinking

179
00:10:13,725 --> 00:10:15,180
Xu Xiao is the kind of man

180
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:18,050
who calculates ten steps
before he takes one.

181
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,580
Why did he allow us

182
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,060
to follow Xu Fengnian?

183
00:10:21,525 --> 00:10:22,660
I'm always afraid that

184
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,340
we'll become victims of his tricks.

185
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,750
Being afraid won't do you any good.

186
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,700
Let's wait and see first.

187
00:10:30,775 --> 00:10:31,660
By the way,

188
00:10:31,975 --> 00:10:33,900
why don't you take the carriage

189
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,140
in front of us today?

190
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,800
God of Sword snores heavily?

191
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,660
It's too noisy.

192
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,140
I don't understand.

193
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:04,075
The two little fellas

194
00:11:04,075 --> 00:11:05,925
always jump about around me.

195
00:11:05,925 --> 00:11:07,250
They seem to fear nothing.

196
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,980
Why are they as good and quiet

197
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:11,875
as kittens when they're around Mr. Li?

198
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,050
The old man is highly skilled
in martial arts.

199
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,375
He can keep them under control.

200
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,380
That is to say,

201
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,860
it's useful
to be skilled in martial arts.

202
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,740
With numerous martial artists,

203
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,500
West Chu was still destroyed.

204
00:11:25,725 --> 00:11:27,725
That was because North Liang
was too strong.

205
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,650
We had the upper hand

206
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,140
at the beginning of the war.

207
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,180
I heard

208
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,000
many generals of Liyang were killed.

209
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:36,600
Yeah.

210
00:11:37,025 --> 00:11:40,475
The legitimate son of the Lu Family
was captured

211
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,200
and was put to death by my father.

212
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,460
Which family?

213
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,380
The Lu Family in Yangcheng,

214
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,975
Xu Zhihu's husband's family?

215
00:11:51,225 --> 00:11:53,350
They must bear a deep grudge
against you.

216
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,250
They don't know my identity.

217
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,340
Don't worry.

218
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,900
Sir.

219
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,850
Yeah.

220
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,300
What's up?

221
00:12:11,575 --> 00:12:12,600
Have we got to the restaurant?

222
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,580
Mansion of Lu is not far.

223
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:14,950
Would you like to eat there?

224
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,075
It's fine.

225
00:12:16,075 --> 00:12:17,020
Call me when we arrive.

226
00:12:17,525 --> 00:12:18,820
Please take care of everyone

227
00:12:18,925 --> 00:12:20,675
when you're at the mansion.

228
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:21,850
And

229
00:12:23,925 --> 00:12:25,860
don't expose Jiang Ni's identity
to the family.

230
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,460
Don't you come with us?

231
00:12:32,025 --> 00:12:33,275
I'm going to Jiangxin County

232
00:12:33,275 --> 00:12:34,500
to meet someone surnamed Liu.

233
00:12:36,275 --> 00:12:37,225
Are you going to kill him?

234
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,340
I'm going to figure out

235
00:12:39,575 --> 00:12:41,220
what's his relationship with my sister.

236
00:12:41,775 --> 00:12:43,900
Don't you know the relationship

237
00:12:44,275 --> 00:12:45,540
between Mr. Liu and Xu Zhihu?

238
00:12:45,925 --> 00:12:47,300
Do they have an affair?

239
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,925
What kind of person is Liu?

240
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,380
He has literary talent

241
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,580
and profound learning
inherited by his family.

242
00:12:53,325 --> 00:12:54,300
The slut ran into him

243
00:12:54,325 --> 00:12:56,780
at Baoguo Temple

244
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,500
and shamelessly seduced him.

245
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,925
He was contemptuous of her.

246
00:13:01,925 --> 00:13:03,525
(Gentry of Jiangnan Liu Liting)
He simply ignored her.

247
00:13:03,525 --> 00:13:04,980
Coincidentally,

248
00:13:05,325 --> 00:13:08,220
(Liu Liting's wife)
Mr. Liu's wife came upon them.

249
00:13:08,225 --> 00:13:10,300
Liu's wife is well connected.

250
00:13:10,675 --> 00:13:13,700
It's said she is related
to a concubine in the palace.

251
00:13:14,575 --> 00:13:16,540
She is Her Grace's niece.

252
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,980
You don't say.

253
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,980
How can she put up with such a slut?

254
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:21,500
Do you know what she did?

255
00:13:22,925 --> 00:13:25,820
She slapped her directly in the face.

256
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,775
She worked off her anger.

257
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,100
Now everyone in Yangcheng knows

258
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,125
our family
have such a daughter-in-law.

259
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,620
It isn't true.

260
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,300
It was not the case.

261
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,700
Do you try to deny it for her?

262
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,380
Let's go.

263
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,940
People have a sense of natural justice.

264
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,475
Never mind.

265
00:13:53,725 --> 00:13:55,775
It's natural that

266
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,940
being wronged and misunderstood
makes you sad.

267
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:00,300
But remember,

268
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,125
don't cry over it.

269
00:14:06,575 --> 00:14:07,825
Tears should only

270
00:14:08,175 --> 00:14:10,325
(Elegant and Refined)
be shed for your loved ones.

271
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,340
Remember?

272
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,425
Yes.

273
00:14:20,075 --> 00:14:22,075
(Yangcheng of Yangzhou
Mansion of Lu)

274
00:14:30,025 --> 00:14:31,325
Son of Lord of North Liang,

275
00:14:31,325 --> 00:14:32,300
Xu Fengnian,

276
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:33,580
drove by Yangcheng.

277
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,740
Please...

278
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,050
I've inquired about it.

279
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:44,740
It's Liu Liting's mansion.

280
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,250
How's his reputation?

281
00:14:46,525 --> 00:14:48,075
People say he writes good articles.

282
00:14:48,175 --> 00:14:49,300
He's been talented since he was a child.

283
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,200
What about his family?

284
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:53,200
In Yangzhou,

285
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,750
his family is only regarded as
second-class.

286
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,475
That doesn't feel right.

287
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,540
What do you mean?

288
00:15:01,925 --> 00:15:04,060
The Lu Family is a first-class family.

289
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:04,940
Lu Daolin, the head of the Lu Family,

290
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,050
is the Minister of Rites

291
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,900
and the principal
of the national college.

292
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,780
With such a status,

293
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,140
even Zhang Julu has to

294
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,540
show some respect for him.

295
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,300
How dare Liu Liting

296
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,620
hook up with the daughter-in-law
of the Lu Family?

297
00:15:19,025 --> 00:15:19,975
Your Highness.

298
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,325
The whole city knows

299
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,300
it's Lady Zhihu
who has crushes on Liu.

300
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,350
Liu didn't hook up with her.

301
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,975
With my sister's status,

302
00:15:30,975 --> 00:15:32,675
how can she
have crushes on such a man?

303
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,460
Love is not

304
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,620
reasonable.

305
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,340
Enough.

306
00:15:38,925 --> 00:15:40,580
Let's find out the truth.

307
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:41,700
Shu Xiu.

308
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,175
I'm counting on you.

309
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,825
(Mansion of Lu)

310
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,800
Who are you?

311
00:16:22,825 --> 00:16:24,350
I'm Lu Dongyang,

312
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,075
housekeeper of the mansion.

313
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,220
Nice to meet you.

314
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,380
Xu Fengnian,
son of Lord of North Liang,

315
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,380
drove by your city.

316
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:32,940
We come to visit relatives.

317
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,975
(No Guests)
What a coincidence.

318
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,275
(No Guests)

319
00:16:41,275 --> 00:16:43,125
We don't receive guests today.

320
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,940
Please go back.

321
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,300
Pay a visit another day.

322
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,375
Well,

323
00:16:47,825 --> 00:16:48,500
we've just

324
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,475
arrived at Yangcheng.

325
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,500
We have no place to stay.

326
00:16:50,925 --> 00:16:52,400
It's none of my business.

327
00:16:55,225 --> 00:16:58,220
Would you please do us a favor
and inform Lady Zhihu?

328
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,675
Xu Zhihu ruined the family tradition.

329
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,860
How does she have the face
to receive guests?

330
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,300
Mr. Lu,

331
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,750
whatever the truth is,

332
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,775
please announce

333
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:23,500
our arrival.

334
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,820
What're you doing?

335
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,700
The guy humiliated us on purpose.

336
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:33,620
It has nothing to do with you.

337
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,325
I can't bear it.

338
00:17:35,675 --> 00:17:36,675
Oh, dear.

339
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,325
Have you forgotten the grudge
the Lu Family held against your country?

340
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:40,380
How dare you get out?

341
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,900
Aren't you afraid they'll recognize you?

342
00:17:42,425 --> 00:17:43,900
I was young at that time.

343
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,860
They won't recognize me.

344
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,380
It's said North Liang is a wild land.

345
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,220
You really know nothing about courtesy.

346
00:17:49,575 --> 00:17:51,540
Didn't I make it clear?

347
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,820
We don't receive guests today.

348
00:17:53,975 --> 00:17:55,380
Why should I notice your arrival?

349
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,660
Wei Shuyang is such a coward.

350
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,900
How could he swallow the insult?

351
00:18:01,525 --> 00:18:03,600
Since Xu's daughter
married into Lu Family,

352
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,100
they've become allies.

353
00:18:05,775 --> 00:18:07,980
Considering the relationship
between the two families,

354
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,540
Wei Shuyang won't be reckless.

355
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:13,650
Ouch.

356
00:18:14,775 --> 00:18:15,580
Give me a blade.

357
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,620
How dare you!

358
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,400
Don't be reckless.

359
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,200
This...

360
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,100
This is Yangcheng,

361
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:26,860
not North Liang.

362
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,180
In North Liang,
we have a simple rule

363
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,740
to treat people.

364
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,700
If you treat me with courtesy,

365
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,025
I'll return you with courtesy.

366
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,825
If you treat me with blades,

367
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,420
I'll return you with those, too.

368
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,950
(No Guests)

369
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,175
Mr. Lu, please forgive her.

370
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,425
Open the door.

371
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:48,500
Hurry up.

372
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,460
Open the side door and let them in.

373
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,600
Open the front door.

374
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,325
To open the front door

375
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,860
requires the head's permission.

376
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,980
I can't make the decision.

377
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,425
Do you mind if I

378
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,940
go to ask for permission?

379
00:19:03,825 --> 00:19:04,900
Don't bother.

380
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,070
Remove the front door.

381
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:07,725
Ah?

382
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:10,860
Give it to me.

383
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,220
Don't follow me.

384
00:19:15,425 --> 00:19:16,340
Get back to your work.

385
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,660
He is Liu Liting.

386
00:19:23,025 --> 00:19:24,260
Other scholars

387
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,100
usually keep away from the kitchen,

388
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,780
but he would cook himself.

389
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,860
It's rare.

390
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,780
Honey.

391
00:19:30,075 --> 00:19:30,925
It's me.

392
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,550
My sister won't have crushes on him.

393
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,500
Why are you so sure?

394
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:38,500
She's got someone in her mind.

395
00:19:41,025 --> 00:19:42,460
Is it her husband who died of illness?

396
00:19:43,425 --> 00:19:44,780
He is at

397
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,020
Mount Wudang.

398
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,500
Mount Wudang?

399
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,375
Aren't there all Taoists?

400
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,140
Get back to your work.

401
00:20:03,425 --> 00:20:04,660
Here, honey.

402
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,020
Try this soup.

403
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,500
I've cooked it for a long time.

404
00:20:08,325 --> 00:20:09,550
Are you still angry?

405
00:20:09,925 --> 00:20:11,580
It's bad for your health.

406
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,860
I'd better die of anger.

407
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,100
You'll find it satisfactory, won't you?

408
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,500
You're wrong about me.

409
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:18,460
You know

410
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,625
it was the slut who pestered me.

411
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,125
It was an unexpected calamity.

412
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,700
The woman is much younger than me.

413
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,620
Honey.

414
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,225
I love you truly.

415
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,580
How could I be attracted to that slut?

416
00:20:38,275 --> 00:20:41,260
Why don't you believe me?

417
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,900
That woman is shameless.

418
00:20:45,025 --> 00:20:46,665
Don't see her again.

419
00:20:46,665 --> 00:20:47,725
I won't.

420
00:20:47,725 --> 00:20:48,650
I avoid her like the plague.

421
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:49,975
How would I see her?

422
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,620
Taste this.

423
00:20:52,525 --> 00:20:53,420
Don't be angry.

424
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,060
Madam hasn't started eating yet.

425
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,620
Come when she finishes off.

426
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,550
The servants become unruly now.

427
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,650
Don't be upset.

428
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,220
I'll have a look.

429
00:21:07,775 --> 00:21:08,700
Who is it?

430
00:21:09,775 --> 00:21:11,220
Liu Liting, Mr. Liu.

431
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,525
Who is this?

432
00:21:13,525 --> 00:21:14,975
How dare she come to our home?

433
00:21:15,325 --> 00:21:16,625
I don't know her, either.

434
00:21:17,975 --> 00:21:19,220
How did you get in?

435
00:21:20,275 --> 00:21:21,180
What do you want?

436
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:25,540
It tastes good.

437
00:21:26,225 --> 00:21:27,340
Liu Liting.

438
00:21:27,425 --> 00:21:28,740
What's going on exactly?

439
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,620
Honey.

440
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:30,500
Honey, cool down.

441
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,925
I really don't know who she is.

442
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,580
Who are you exactly?

443
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,780
How did you get in our mansion?

444
00:21:36,975 --> 00:21:37,860
Get out...

445
00:21:39,225 --> 00:21:40,500
Honey.

446
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,150
Cool down. Don't be angry.

447
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:42,980
Don't be angry.

448
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,260
Get someone to take her
and send her to the government.

449
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,780
Yes. I'm going to get help.

450
00:21:46,225 --> 00:21:47,600
Madam, your hairpin is beautiful.

451
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,675
What do you want?

452
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,300
Ouch.

453
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,800
Miss, if you want money,

454
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,020
let him go.

455
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,980
We can talk about it.

456
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,060
I don't want money.

457
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,340
I want a life.

458
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,340
Mr. Liu is of a great name.

459
00:22:00,675 --> 00:22:02,020
Why don't you lend me your life?

460
00:22:03,275 --> 00:22:05,350
We've never met each other before.

461
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,140
Why do you hate me so much?

462
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:08,660
I don't hate you,

463
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,420
but I hate North Liang

464
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,140
very much.

465
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,375
I have nothing to do with North Liang.

466
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,500
Xu Zhihu

467
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,275
is Xu Xiao's daughter.

468
00:22:17,275 --> 00:22:20,060
Then you should go to Mansion of Lu
and kill her.

469
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,420
The mansion is heavily guarded.

470
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,100
Besides,

471
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,260
Lu Baijie, Sword Immortal of Tangxi,

472
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,000
is also in the mansion.

473
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,020
I can't break in.

474
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,020
(Mansion of Lu)

475
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,475
It's much brighter.

476
00:22:32,825 --> 00:22:34,460
Don't you think you've gone too far?

477
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,025
The more domineering we are,
the more relieved the royal court will feel.

478
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,500
If we're disciplined,

479
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,380
they'll fear us instead.

480
00:22:52,325 --> 00:22:54,420
After all, we represent His Highness.

481
00:22:54,575 --> 00:22:55,820
You shouldn't humiliate us.

482
00:23:00,325 --> 00:23:01,300
Let's get inside.

483
00:23:02,225 --> 00:23:03,300
Today,

484
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,820
it was our fault to shut you out.

485
00:23:08,525 --> 00:23:09,700
I apologize

486
00:23:09,825 --> 00:23:10,740
to you

487
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,275
on behalf of the housekeeper.

488
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,900
Baxiu Sword.

489
00:23:15,975 --> 00:23:17,020
You are...

490
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:20,020
You're Sword Immortal of Tangxi,

491
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,625
Lu Baijie.

492
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:23,400
(Sword Immortal of Tangxi
Lu Baijie)

493
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,775
In the presence of God of Sword,

494
00:23:25,825 --> 00:23:27,260
I feel unworthy of the name.

495
00:23:28,225 --> 00:23:30,340
I've heard the name of God of Sword
for a long time.

496
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:31,620
Today, I venture to suggest you

497
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,700
show me Snakes in Sleeves.

498
00:23:34,175 --> 00:23:35,400
Let's have a competition on swordplay.

499
00:23:36,225 --> 00:23:37,820
How do you know he is with us?

500
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,820
Since the battle of Reed Marshes,

501
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,875
God of Sword's valorous fame

502
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:43,420
has spread throughout the world.

503
00:23:45,025 --> 00:23:45,900
Sir,

504
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,000
would you condescend to teach me?

505
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,150
Qingniao.

506
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,620
Lady Zhihu.

507
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:05,000
Grandpa Wei.

508
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,175
Lady Zhihu.

509
00:24:06,475 --> 00:24:07,725
You came so soon.

510
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,020
Where's Fengnian?

511
00:24:10,725 --> 00:24:12,245
He went to Jiangxin County.

512
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,700
He's such a fool.

513
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,140
Uncle.

514
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:22,980
What're you doing?

515
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:26,700
Being apart for a long time,

516
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,380
you should catch up first.

517
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:31,780
I got it.

518
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,350
Lu Baijie is the only one

519
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,450
who regards Xu Zhihu

520
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,700
as a family member in the Lu Family.

521
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,775
It's not easy for you

522
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:39,950
to kill Xu Zhihu.

523
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,420
But, Miss,

524
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,980
you want to kill
a member of the Xu Family,

525
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,300
yet I'm from the Liu Family.

526
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,820
Everyone in Jiangnan knows that

527
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,060
you and Xu Zhihu are having an affair.

528
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,500
By killing you,

529
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:52,680
I'll let her know the taste of pain.

530
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:53,620
Miss.

531
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,300
Miss.

532
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,780
Though the slut pestered my husband,

533
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,700
he despised her very much.

534
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,100
They don't have an affair.

535
00:25:01,975 --> 00:25:03,100
Why don't you escape?

536
00:25:04,075 --> 00:25:05,525
A wife and her husband
should live or die together.

537
00:25:05,975 --> 00:25:07,775
How can I leave him?

538
00:25:08,025 --> 00:25:09,275
Ouch.

539
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:11,250
You have such a good wife.

540
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,220
All she said is true.

541
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,460
I have nothing to do with Xu Zhihu.

542
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:18,460
I'm disgusted with her.

543
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,340
It doesn't matter
how you feel about her.

544
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,500
The point is she loves you.

545
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:23,980
Killing you

546
00:25:24,175 --> 00:25:25,420
will make her feel pain.

547
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,140
Miss, spare my life.

548
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,220
Miss, have mercy on me.

549
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:28,825
Shut up.

550
00:25:28,825 --> 00:25:30,220
Honey, help me.

551
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:31,210
Miss,

552
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,420
I'm related to a concubine
in the palace.

553
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:36,260
Have you thought about

554
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,540
the consequences?

555
00:25:37,925 --> 00:25:39,140
People don't think much

556
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,420
while seeking revenge.

557
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,620
Wait. Wait.

558
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,220
Miss.

559
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,220
Let me help you to kill Xu Zhihu.

560
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,200
How can you do that?

561
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:50,900
The slut still has a fantasy about me.

562
00:25:51,275 --> 00:25:52,425
If I ask her out,

563
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:53,460
she'll definitely come out.

564
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,820
Why do you tread in muddy water?

565
00:25:55,725 --> 00:25:57,100
Let me write a letter

566
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,620
and ask her out.

567
00:25:58,875 --> 00:25:59,860
Look at me.

568
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,820
I'm so weak.

569
00:26:02,175 --> 00:26:03,620
How can I escape?

570
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:07,980
It's right.

571
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,425
Ouch.

572
00:26:10,775 --> 00:26:11,607
Ouch.

573
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:17,700
Try to run away

574
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,180
or scream for help.

575
00:26:19,725 --> 00:26:21,580
I don't think anyone would come
to rescue you.

576
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,875
I dare not.

577
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,750
Let me find a brush and some ink.

578
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,860
The words I'm about to say

579
00:26:53,025 --> 00:26:54,380
mustn't be heard by her.

580
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:56,850
What words?

581
00:26:57,025 --> 00:26:58,660
The real relationship

582
00:26:58,875 --> 00:27:00,140
between Xu Zhihu and me.

583
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,700
(Cries of Crane)

584
00:27:11,725 --> 00:27:12,825
Thank you.

585
00:27:13,525 --> 00:27:14,700
Don't stand on ceremony.

586
00:27:15,075 --> 00:27:17,075
I'm glad to see the people

587
00:27:17,075 --> 00:27:18,540
from North Liang.

588
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,500
Sit down.

589
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:25,575
I've arranged accommodation
for everyone.

590
00:27:25,575 --> 00:27:26,900
Don't worry.

591
00:27:29,075 --> 00:27:30,580
Fengnian

592
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,025
should come to see me first.

593
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:34,350
His Highness

594
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,860
heard the rumors.

595
00:27:35,975 --> 00:27:37,550
He wanted to find out the truth.

596
00:27:41,175 --> 00:27:42,940
What happened between me and Liu Liting

597
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,025
wasn't like what people made out.

598
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:46,860
How come?

599
00:27:47,675 --> 00:27:49,315
It was you who pestered Xu Zhihu?

600
00:27:49,425 --> 00:27:50,540
Yes, I did.

601
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:53,800
Every time when Xu came out,

602
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,700
I would find a chance to run into her.

603
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,100
I wrote her poets

604
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,160
and complimented her beauty.

605
00:27:58,825 --> 00:28:00,250
I used a variety of tactics

606
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,020
and exhausted all mental efforts.

607
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,175
If it were another woman,

608
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:05,740
she would be moved.

609
00:28:06,225 --> 00:28:08,660
But Xu Zhihu was iron-hearted.

610
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,780
She always kept a good distance from me.

611
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,180
What about Baoguo Temple?

612
00:28:20,425 --> 00:28:21,825
That mild-mannered girl

613
00:28:22,225 --> 00:28:23,540
is a good mate to a gentleman.

614
00:28:23,975 --> 00:28:25,100
I am

615
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,550
mad about you.

616
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:35,060
Your wife happened to see you?

617
00:28:37,525 --> 00:28:38,725
It wasn't a coincidence.

618
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,460
She specially went to look for me.

619
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,540
And then?

620
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,740
She didn't see me catching her sleeves.

621
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,775
I kept my wits about me

622
00:28:48,925 --> 00:28:50,860
and scolded Xu Zhihu
for being lack of virtue

623
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,980
and pestering me again and again.

624
00:28:52,525 --> 00:28:53,900
You were pretty quick.

625
00:28:54,225 --> 00:28:55,860
I was out of option.

626
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,380
What happened next?

627
00:28:59,925 --> 00:29:01,340
My wife believed me.

628
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:03,340
She slapped Xu in anger.

629
00:29:11,675 --> 00:29:13,140
How dare you strike me back?

630
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:15,540
You treat me with blades,
I'll return you with blades.

631
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:18,100
It's what the people of North Liang do.

632
00:29:21,775 --> 00:29:22,820
So,

633
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:24,620
Xu Zhihu doesn't

634
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,000
have any affection for me.

635
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,850
The only thing she has towards me
is probably hatred.

636
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:29,940
Miss,

637
00:29:30,175 --> 00:29:31,380
it won't hurt her at all

638
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,100
if you kill me.

639
00:29:34,975 --> 00:29:36,075
I don't understand.

640
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,580
Since Xu was pestered by you,

641
00:29:38,625 --> 00:29:40,300
why didn't she clarify the rumors?

642
00:29:40,725 --> 00:29:41,660
Well,

643
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,425
I didn't figure it out myself.

644
00:29:44,525 --> 00:29:45,580
Perhaps...

645
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,850
Perhaps she was

646
00:29:48,075 --> 00:29:49,325
too proud

647
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,050
to clarify it?

648
00:29:52,425 --> 00:29:54,700
Liu Liting has a literary fame

649
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,820
while I am

650
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,300
from North Liang.

651
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:59,940
People in Jiangnan

652
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,260
regard us as monsters.

653
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,860
Do you think anyone will believe me?

654
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,380
What about the Lu Family?

655
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,220
You've married into the family.

656
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,740
They should treat you differently.

657
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:11,825
The so-called marriage

658
00:30:12,075 --> 00:30:13,150
was just a deal

659
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,580
made by the Lu Family and North Liang.

660
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,460
As soon as the deal is done,

661
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:18,500
I'm of no use.

662
00:30:19,075 --> 00:30:20,580
Why do you think they let me

663
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,100
marry a dying man?

664
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,125
Lady Zhihu,

665
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:27,620
I'm sorry you are wronged.

666
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,660
Don't be.

667
00:30:29,225 --> 00:30:30,850
I'm willing to do so.

668
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,750
It's good enough that
North Liang sacrificed me

669
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:35,380
in exchange for an ally.

670
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,900
I mean

671
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,020
the rumors about you and Liu Liting.

672
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,980
A bunch of people I don't know
defame me.

673
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,200
It has nothing to do with me.

674
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,750
I don't feel like
arguing with them at all.

675
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,820
His Highness won't misunderstand you.

676
00:30:51,275 --> 00:30:52,340
I know.

677
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,675
He wants to

678
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:58,220
defend me against injustice.

679
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,420
They're just empty words.

680
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,460
Why should I believe you?

681
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,500
I can swear to God.

682
00:31:08,475 --> 00:31:10,350
Can you compare to
such a powerful family

683
00:31:10,525 --> 00:31:11,620
as Lu in Jiangnan?

684
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,500
Well...

685
00:31:14,225 --> 00:31:15,460
I can't.

686
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,625
Then why did you pester Xu Zhihu?

687
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,660
Though she's a widow,

688
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,350
she is still a member of the Lu Family.

689
00:31:22,075 --> 00:31:24,060
Weren't you afraid
the rumors about you and her

690
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,580
would offend the family?

691
00:31:27,025 --> 00:31:27,900
Well...

692
00:31:31,675 --> 00:31:34,660
Xu Zhihu is really beautiful.

693
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,300
So I'm attracted to her.

694
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,375
So

695
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,340
you risked your future for her?

696
00:31:42,175 --> 00:31:43,540
Do you think I'll believe you?

697
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,150
Well...

698
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,375
You can't explain it clearly, can you?

699
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,100
I think

700
00:31:54,575 --> 00:31:55,740
I'd better kill you.

701
00:31:56,225 --> 00:31:59,140
What's your feud with North Liang?

702
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,180
You don't get to ask questions.

703
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,580
There're some things

704
00:32:04,225 --> 00:32:05,980
I would never tell you

705
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,950
without knowing your identity.

706
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:16,260
It doesn't hurt to tell you.

707
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,300
I'm the princess of Chu.

708
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,100
The princess of West Chu?

709
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,980
You want me to walk around

710
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,425
being dressed like this?

711
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:48,130
Do you still want to walk around?

712
00:32:50,525 --> 00:32:52,060
This is Mansion of Lu.

713
00:32:52,075 --> 00:32:54,000
You'd better hide in the room.

714
00:32:54,725 --> 00:32:56,260
You're overreacting.

715
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,375
Better than you get yourself killed.

716
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,540
Under my protection,

717
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,140
she won't get killed.

718
00:33:02,025 --> 00:33:03,050
Thank you, sir.

719
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,860
I can rest assured with your protection.

720
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,700
Xu Fengnian asked me to protect you.

721
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,675
You should thank him, girl.

722
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,900
I would never thank him.

723
00:33:20,925 --> 00:33:22,020
Old man.

724
00:33:22,275 --> 00:33:23,140
Yes?

725
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,860
Where's my Divine Token?

726
00:33:33,225 --> 00:33:35,260
I lent it to you.

727
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,725
Have you lost it?

728
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,230
Be quiet.

729
00:33:38,275 --> 00:33:39,375
Xu Fengnian

730
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:40,500
borrowed it just now.

731
00:33:40,775 --> 00:33:41,780
He has no rights

732
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,175
to borrow my dagger.

733
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,375
Why did he borrow it?

734
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:54,020
Do you recognize

735
00:33:54,775 --> 00:33:55,620
the dagger?

736
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,140
The national dagger of West Chu,

737
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,700
Divine Token.

738
00:34:00,175 --> 00:34:01,340
You know it.

739
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,740
According to historical records,

740
00:34:07,025 --> 00:34:08,075
the dagger

741
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,940
may exchange for twelve cities.

742
00:34:10,325 --> 00:34:12,340
I've heard of the precious dagger.

743
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,725
Are you really the princess of Chu?

744
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,540
Are you still alive?

745
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:20,380
Do you wish me to die?

746
00:34:22,075 --> 00:34:23,220
I dare not.

747
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,420
Now I got it.

748
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:31,725
Xu Xiao conquered Chu.

749
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:34,075
Of course you hate them.

750
00:34:34,775 --> 00:34:36,425
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

751
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:40,300
I heard that Xu Fengnian
is about to arrive at Jiangnan.

752
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,180
You showed up at this time.

753
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,620
It makes me confused.

754
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,100
I came to Jiangnan this time

755
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,780
in order to kill Xu Fengnian.

756
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,150
You're just extra points.

757
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:55,675
I...

758
00:34:55,925 --> 00:34:57,300
I have the same goal as you.

759
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,540
I'm against North Liang, too.

760
00:34:59,325 --> 00:35:00,380
Please wait a minute.

761
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:05,229
(To Liu Liting)

762
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,140
Look at this.

763
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,325
(From Jin Lanting at Imperial Academy)

764
00:35:21,325 --> 00:35:22,325
Imperial Academy?

765
00:35:23,425 --> 00:35:24,260
Was it from the capital?

766
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,750
A good friend of mine

767
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,025
is a scholar of Imperial Academy.

768
00:35:28,425 --> 00:35:30,460
Was it his idea

769
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,100
to besmirch Xu Zhihu's reputation?

770
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:37,825
He said the court was always
wary of North Liang.

771
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,100
After North Liang
united with Jiangnan by marriage,

772
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,500
they became a sting in their heart.

773
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,675
If I blacken Xu Zhihu's name,

774
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:46,000
I may turn the Lu Family

775
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,140
against North Liang.

776
00:35:47,325 --> 00:35:48,500
Though doing so

777
00:35:48,675 --> 00:35:49,780
may offend the Lu Family,

778
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,180
in the end, I may be appreciated
by His Majesty.

779
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,500
When I go to the capital next time,

780
00:35:53,975 --> 00:35:56,375
I'll get a limitless future.

781
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,475
Therefore,

782
00:35:57,725 --> 00:35:59,860
it was a complete conspiracy.

783
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,425
Pestering Xu Zhihu
was just a smoke bomb.

784
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:05,420
Don't call it a conspiracy.

785
00:36:05,625 --> 00:36:08,580
As a scholar,
it's my duty to serve my country.

786
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,675
Does she

787
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:11,475
know about these?

788
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,150
No, she doesn't.

789
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,000
What did you say?

790
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,660
Your wife happened to see you?

791
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,900
It wasn't a coincidence.

792
00:36:23,425 --> 00:36:24,780
She specially went to look for me.

793
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,780
It wasn't a coincidence?

794
00:36:26,075 --> 00:36:27,620
I have a message sent to my wife

795
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,220
before she hurried to Baoguo Temple.

796
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:35,740
Then you took advantage of
your wife's relative

797
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,460
and let the concubine in the palace

798
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,300
help you to publicize it,

799
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,700
so His Majesty
would hear of your name.

800
00:36:42,925 --> 00:36:43,950
Liu Liting,

801
00:36:44,475 --> 00:36:46,540
how could you trick your own wife?

802
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,060
I just followed the trend.

803
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,340
Don't say that.

804
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:53,580
Your Highness,

805
00:36:54,175 --> 00:36:55,825
do you believe me now?

806
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,780
I have the same goal as you.

807
00:36:58,025 --> 00:36:59,775
We're both against North Liang.

808
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,375
As for that,

809
00:37:02,425 --> 00:37:03,425
you're right.

810
00:37:05,675 --> 00:37:07,275
You're really vicious.

811
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,400
Xu Zhihu is ruined by you.

812
00:37:10,825 --> 00:37:12,500
The Lu Family has strict rules.

813
00:37:12,775 --> 00:37:14,140
In my opinion,

814
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,650
it's best if the Lu Family
exercise domestic discipline on her.

815
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,500
She may be beaten to death.

816
00:37:19,675 --> 00:37:22,425
Unfortunately, Lu Baijie
has been protecting her.

817
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:23,980
It doesn't matter now.

818
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,325
We've got a chance.

819
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,420
What chance?

820
00:37:27,575 --> 00:37:30,020
We should figure out
Xu Fengnian's schedule first.

821
00:37:30,275 --> 00:37:31,725
Because of the rumors,

822
00:37:31,725 --> 00:37:33,075
he would come to see me alone.

823
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:36,100
Then you take the opportunity
to kill him.

824
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:39,020
You can take revenge for your country.

825
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,060
As for me,

826
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,300
I can completely destroy

827
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,980
the oath of alliance forged
by the Lu Family and North Liang.

828
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,260
It satisfies both sides.

829
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,850
You're brilliant.

830
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,825
No wonder you're a scholar.

831
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,475
Who wrote the letter?

832
00:37:58,975 --> 00:37:59,600
You...

833
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:01,150
Who are you?

834
00:38:03,725 --> 00:38:04,740
Jin Lanting.

835
00:38:05,475 --> 00:38:06,460
I've never heard of him.

836
00:38:06,975 --> 00:38:08,780
There're many scholars
in Imperial Academy.

837
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,700
It's normal that you didn't hear of him.

838
00:38:10,825 --> 00:38:12,620
I want to know who he works for.

839
00:38:12,725 --> 00:38:13,740
Zhang Julu,

840
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:14,860
or someone else?

841
00:38:15,475 --> 00:38:16,500
It's hard to decide.

842
00:38:16,775 --> 00:38:19,100
He's got such devious means.

843
00:38:19,425 --> 00:38:21,660
We must investigate him carefully later.

844
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:23,900
You did a great job just now,

845
00:38:24,075 --> 00:38:25,460
but there was a flaw.

846
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,140
When he said he was under instructions
from the capital,

847
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,420
you shouldn't
soften your stance so quickly.

848
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:31,860
The people of Chu hate Xu Xiao,

849
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,100
but they hate the royal family
even more.

850
00:38:33,325 --> 00:38:34,460
When he said his wife is related

851
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:36,340
to a concubine in the palace,

852
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:37,940
you should be tougher,

853
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,425
which fitted your role better.

854
00:38:39,575 --> 00:38:40,780
I'm not

855
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,980
as thoughtful as you.

856
00:38:42,325 --> 00:38:43,875
Who the hell are you?

857
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,975
I'm Xu Fengnian.

858
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,940
I heard you were going to kill me.

859
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:51,500
It doesn't matter, though.

860
00:38:52,725 --> 00:38:54,740
But you've crossed my bottom line

861
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,100
trying to kill my sister
through the hands of the Lu Family.

862
00:38:57,625 --> 00:39:00,180
You treat me with blades,
I'll return you with blades.

863
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,275
Liu Liting,

864
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,780
you've brought ruin

865
00:39:04,325 --> 00:39:06,020
upon yourself.

866
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,975
Help!

867
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,220
Your Highness.

868
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:21,500
What about her?

869
00:39:23,125 --> 00:39:24,780
She slapped my sister once.

870
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,025
My sister slapped her in return.

871
00:39:28,475 --> 00:39:30,940
We're even with her.

872
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,380
Just let her go?

873
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:34,820
Why don't we kill her?

874
00:39:34,825 --> 00:39:35,660
It's easy.

875
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,275
Whatever we do,

876
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,100
we shouldn't cross the bottom line.

877
00:39:44,175 --> 00:39:46,300
Where are they going to take Mr. Liu?

878
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,475
What did he do?

879
00:39:49,975 --> 00:39:51,600
What about his family?

880
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,575
We just tied them up.

881
00:39:53,575 --> 00:39:54,540
We didn't hurt them.

882
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,150
Good.

883
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,340
Why do you shut his mouth?

884
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,460
Remove the gag.

885
00:40:03,075 --> 00:40:04,660
Help!

886
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:07,900
The son of Lord of North Liang
is killing people!

887
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,175
- Just scream.
- Xu Fengnian.

888
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:12,660
Xu Fengnian dares to lynch people.

889
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:15,140
Is there any law in the country?

890
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,425
Is there any heavenly principle?

891
00:40:16,425 --> 00:40:17,325
He's right.

892
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:20,420
I'm the son of Lord of North Liang, Xu Fengnian.

893
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,150
Everyone,

894
00:40:21,325 --> 00:40:23,540
keep it in your mind.

895
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:24,540
Xu Fengnian,

896
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:26,000
you can't kill me.

897
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,175
Of course, I can kill you
if you try to kill other people.

898
00:40:29,275 --> 00:40:31,060
It's the heavenly principle and justice.

899
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:32,660
I know I've made a mistake.

900
00:40:33,775 --> 00:40:34,700
I'm willing to...

901
00:40:35,325 --> 00:40:37,650
I'm willing to work for you.

902
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,780
You've lost your last bit of guts.

903
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:43,875
Go.

904
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,140
Get back to Yangcheng.

905
00:40:45,575 --> 00:40:46,450
Xu Fengnian!

906
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,700
Xu Fengnian!

907
00:40:49,475 --> 00:40:50,925
- Xu Fengnian, let go of me!
- It may kill him.

908
00:40:50,925 --> 00:40:51,900
Xu Fengnian!

909
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,500
Xu Fengnian!
You won't die a natural death.

910
00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:59,260
You just said
he was in danger in Reed Marshes.

911
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,780
Now God of Sword isn't around him.

912
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,780
He went to Jiangxin County

913
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,260
on the spur of the moment.

914
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,540
He won't be assassinated.

915
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,125
I'm not just worried about him.

916
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:13,260
With so many guards around him,

917
00:41:13,525 --> 00:41:15,020
he was still attacked.

918
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,860
Huangman'er went to Mount Longhu alone.

919
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,300
It must be more dangerous.

920
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:21,260
With extraordinary power,
he can protect himself.

921
00:41:22,075 --> 00:41:23,860
He is just human after all.

922
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,780
I thought in the first place

923
00:41:27,025 --> 00:41:28,780
as long as I married into the Lu Family,

924
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,620
they would stay safely in North Liang.

925
00:41:33,225 --> 00:41:34,400
I didn't expect us

926
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:36,860
to be far apart

927
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,940
from each other in the end.

928
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:09,860
Little buddy,

929
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,140
may I ask if this is Mount Longhu?

930
00:42:12,025 --> 00:42:12,750
Yeah.

931
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,620
Which direction should I take
going up the mountain?

932
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:17,540
Thanks.

933
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,540
What are you looking at?

934
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:25,780
I'm waiting for the hawthorns.

935
00:42:25,975 --> 00:42:26,740
Hawthorns?

936
00:42:27,525 --> 00:42:28,700
When the hawthorns are ripe,
