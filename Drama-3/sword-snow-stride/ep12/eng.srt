1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

5
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
=Sword Snow Stride=
(Season 1)

6
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,400
=Episode 12=

7
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,500
There you are, Fengnian.

8
00:01:54,275 --> 00:01:55,020
Come on.

9
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,500
Be seated.

10
00:01:58,725 --> 00:02:00,340
Huangman'er has been sent
to Mount Longhu.

11
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:01,940
Ah.

12
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,060
I knew that.

13
00:02:03,575 --> 00:02:06,420
I received the letter from Mount Longhu.

14
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,500
Zhao Xituan

15
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:09,900
is nice to Huangman'er,

16
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,100
treating him as his last disciple.

17
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,980
Old Huang made a deal with Zhao Xituan.

18
00:02:27,975 --> 00:02:29,625
Did you arrange it?

19
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:30,700
No.

20
00:02:31,675 --> 00:02:33,220
I didn't know

21
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,325
what Old Huang did.

22
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,460
So, in your original plan,

23
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,580
where would Huangman'er be sent to?

24
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,350
You knew the answer,

25
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,140
didn't you?

26
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,600
I think it was quite a coincidence

27
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,750
that Princess Suizhu appeared
in Mount Wudang.

28
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,025
Everyone is wrong about you.

29
00:03:14,025 --> 00:03:15,500
Fengnian, good job.

30
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,260
Clever boy.

31
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,300
So, you were going to

32
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,650
send Huangman'er to the royal family?

33
00:03:22,925 --> 00:03:24,975
His stay in North Liang
would be bad for you.

34
00:03:25,825 --> 00:03:28,275
The royal family only wants him
as a pawn!

35
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,420
When we give Huangman'er to them,

36
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,050
no harm will be done to us.

37
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,000
He's your son!

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,700
You...

39
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,750
You're also my son.

40
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,980
All right. All right.

41
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,825
Look. The result

42
00:03:43,825 --> 00:03:45,860
is better than we expected.

43
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,650
Isn't it?

44
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,180
But Old Huang died!

45
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,700
I'm willing to take over North Liang.

46
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:30,525
Ah?

47
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,500
I'm willing to take over North Liang!

48
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,380
Wait.

49
00:04:38,275 --> 00:04:39,800
You used to reject it.

50
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,100
Why do you suddenly accept it?

51
00:04:42,475 --> 00:04:43,425
Give me a reason.

52
00:04:44,725 --> 00:04:46,450
I can't get Huangman'er back

53
00:04:47,075 --> 00:04:48,800
unless I take over North Liang.

54
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:51,450
Oh.

55
00:04:53,975 --> 00:04:54,895
Any other reason?

56
00:04:56,075 --> 00:04:57,380
Isn't this enough?

57
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,780
You and your brother are close.

58
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,325
This is good.

59
00:05:05,975 --> 00:05:07,625
But when you want

60
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,580
to be the ruler of three states
in North Liang,

61
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:11,300
this reason isn't...

62
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,900
You don't agree?

63
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:14,900
I do!

64
00:05:15,275 --> 00:05:16,180
I do!

65
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,950
I can't be too happy.

66
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,380
I've been waiting for such a long time

67
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,125
and you agreed at last.

68
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:23,525
The reason isn't enough?

69
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,620
It doesn't matter.

70
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,180
Let me give you a reason.

71
00:05:28,425 --> 00:05:29,620
Seriously?

72
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,575
Since you came back from Wudang Sect,

73
00:05:32,575 --> 00:05:34,335
you haven't visited
your master, have you?

74
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,700
Go tell him you're back.

75
00:05:36,925 --> 00:05:38,300
Wait for me there.

76
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,210
All right?

77
00:05:47,725 --> 00:05:48,540
Go ahead.

78
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,740
I'll be right there.

79
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,275
With the reason for you.

80
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:46,900
You're back?

81
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,275
I have been in Mount Wudang for days.

82
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,200
Why didn't you ask me how my stay was?

83
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,000
How was your stay there?

84
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,500
You sound quite offhand.

85
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,260
What are you doing?

86
00:07:02,575 --> 00:07:03,660
What's down there?

87
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,150
The foundation.

88
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,250
Wrong.

89
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,340
I tramped hard during my blade practice.

90
00:07:10,675 --> 00:07:12,300
I felt there was some space down here.

91
00:07:12,675 --> 00:07:14,060
There's another floor down here,
I guess.

92
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,300
I've been hanging around
in Tingchao Pavilion since I was little.

93
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,460
If there's a floor down there,

94
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,500
I must be aware.

95
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,500
You don't know?

96
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,050
There isn't anything down there.

97
00:07:25,725 --> 00:07:26,620
What?

98
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,800
Wang Chonglou passed you Dahuangting?

99
00:07:29,975 --> 00:07:31,475
You could still see that?

100
00:07:31,475 --> 00:07:33,000
I thought there was no trace of it.

101
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,220
Don't worry.

102
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,700
Others can't see it.

103
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,900
I just know

104
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,300
about the details of Wudang Heart Arts.

105
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,220
You have a connection with Wudang Sect?

106
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,650
A family connection.

107
00:07:44,975 --> 00:07:47,250
What does your family do?

108
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,500
It's none of your business.

109
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,740
Take your time searching.

110
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,660
I'm going upstairs.

111
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:02,380
Give my blade back to me.

112
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,575
Xiudong?

113
00:08:03,675 --> 00:08:04,900
I lent it to you.

114
00:08:05,425 --> 00:08:06,875
It's very handy for me.

115
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,150
Master,

116
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:43,940
I'm back.

117
00:08:52,475 --> 00:08:53,425
Good move.

118
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,675
Hidden intention to kill.

119
00:08:57,075 --> 00:08:57,800
Oh.

120
00:08:59,175 --> 00:09:01,580
I took the wrong move, then.

121
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,020
I'll start a new game.

122
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,150
Master,

123
00:10:18,575 --> 00:10:20,100
you keep playing chess

124
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,625
with yourself in the room.

125
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:22,825
Don't you feel bored?

126
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,900
I've got an opponent.

127
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,350
Where's he?

128
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,140
Don't ask

129
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,575
until you take over North Liang.

130
00:10:38,275 --> 00:10:39,900
I promised Xu Xiao.

131
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,800
Xu Xiao

132
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,000
asked you to come here?

133
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,140
Yes.

134
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,700
Go downstairs, then.

135
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,700
He'll give you an answer.

136
00:11:07,525 --> 00:11:08,850
A piece of advice for you.

137
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,520
Later,

138
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,400
speak your mind to your father.

139
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,180
How did you find it?

140
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,220
Your father opened the door.

141
00:11:50,525 --> 00:11:51,340
There you are.

142
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,180
What's hidden down there?

143
00:11:57,075 --> 00:11:58,180
You even keep it from me.

144
00:12:00,175 --> 00:12:02,125
Unless you promise
to take over North Liang,

145
00:12:02,775 --> 00:12:03,700
I cannot

146
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,000
take you down there.

147
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:06,700
Let's go.

148
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,375
What did your master tell you?

149
00:12:31,475 --> 00:12:33,225
He asked me to speak my mind.

150
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,175
He wanted me to tell you

151
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,140
why I've kept refusing
to take over North Liang

152
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,675
over so many years.

153
00:12:42,175 --> 00:12:43,075
Also,

154
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,380
why have I always been angry

155
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:50,580
with you?

156
00:12:51,475 --> 00:12:52,175
Mm.

157
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,020
I'm all ears.

158
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,540
You know

159
00:12:56,825 --> 00:12:58,725
my eldest sister likes Hong Xixiang.

160
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,060
The young Taoist on Mount Wudang?

161
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:02,940
I certainly know.

162
00:13:03,275 --> 00:13:05,325
You still married her to Jiangnan.
[*Jiangnan: regions south of the Yangtze River]

163
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,725
Mm.

164
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,500
Only in this way

165
00:13:08,675 --> 00:13:09,900
could you get support

166
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,200
from scholars in Jiangnan.

167
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,420
Yes.

168
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:14,420
My second eldest sister came back,

169
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,625
but only saw me once.

170
00:13:16,075 --> 00:13:17,060
You didn't keep her.

171
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:17,780
I didn't.

172
00:13:18,675 --> 00:13:20,220
You made her study
in Shangyin Academy

173
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,550
so that scholars all over the world

174
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,275
would gradually accept North Liang.

175
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,380
Exactly.

176
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,050
Now, you've sent Huangman'er away, too.

177
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,340
You sent my siblings away,

178
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,925
in exchange for stable power.

179
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,660
Formidable enemies want to fight us.

180
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,860
The royal family fears us.

181
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,875
For the survival of North Liang,

182
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,025
we have to pay some price.

183
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,050
So, in your heart,

184
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,340
our family isn't as important
as the throne of North Liang.

185
00:13:57,275 --> 00:13:58,850
We're arriving soon.

186
00:14:07,175 --> 00:14:09,895
Formless yet complete?

187
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,300
Run away!

188
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,425
Some people want to kill you.

189
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,575
Who?

190
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,500
They're disguised as servants.

191
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,600
I saw them hold blades

192
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,960
and head for your room.

193
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,125
Not everybody dares to break

194
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,950
into the house of His Highness.

195
00:14:21,325 --> 00:14:22,100
I'll stop them.

196
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,075
Leave through the window.

197
00:14:24,525 --> 00:14:26,200
If Miss Weixiong wanted to kill you,

198
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,925
she wouldn't ask her subordinates
to do that.

199
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,475
I know.

200
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,260
I stopped them

201
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,300
for you.

202
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,825
I've confiscated their blades, too.

203
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,660
Why do servants

204
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,660
dare to kill people?

205
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,650
Servants in the house of Miss Weixiong

206
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,650
used to be bandits
convicted of grave crimes.

207
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,975
Why do they work in the Mansion?

208
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,150
Miss Weixiong caught them.

209
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,340
Since little,

210
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,380
Miss Weixiong has loved to kill.

211
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,325
She has exterminated
countless bandits out of the town.

212
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,250
Many people sighed

213
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,940
it was a pity

214
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,500
that Xu Weixiong wasn't a man.

215
00:15:22,775 --> 00:15:25,300
(Zhao Kai, student in Shangyin Academy)

216
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,225
You're back?

217
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,100
You seldom go back home.

218
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,220
Why didn't you stay at home
for a few more days?

219
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,580
How's everything going in your family?

220
00:15:35,775 --> 00:15:37,150
Who gave it to you?

221
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,650
Why didn't you accept what I gave you?

222
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,675
Next time,

223
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,175
let me go to North Liang with you.

224
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,780
I want to accompany you and protect you.

225
00:15:55,275 --> 00:15:56,050
Wait.

226
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,000
See you in class.

227
00:16:12,811 --> 00:16:16,859
(Shangyin Academy)

228
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,260
Are your legs all right?

229
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,475
We've reached the bottom of the lake.

230
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,625
It's quite damp here.

231
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,260
But I'm all right.

232
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,450
What's hiding down there?

233
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,900
You'll see it yourself.

234
00:17:58,425 --> 00:17:59,950
(Tablet of General Zhao Changling,
of the 18th Battalion of Jinzhou)

235
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,425
(Tablet of General Chen Qiong,
of the 18th Battalion of Jinzhou)

236
00:18:01,425 --> 00:18:02,850
(Tablet of General Wang Jian,
of the 18th Battalion of Jinzhou)

237
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,740
Chen Zhibao's father...

238
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,820
In the Battle of Jinliao,

239
00:18:19,075 --> 00:18:20,200
he died

240
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,725
to save my life.

241
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,300
Otherwise,

242
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,220
he would have been

243
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,700
the Lord of North Liang.

244
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,875
(Tablet of General Chen Qiong,
of the 18th Battalion of Jinzhou)

245
00:18:35,025 --> 00:18:36,175
Everybody

246
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,460
asked me

247
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,780
to be on the watch for Chen Zhibao.

248
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,460
But I know

249
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,800
what North Liang means

250
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,450
to him.

251
00:18:48,175 --> 00:18:49,200
Wang Jian.

252
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,375
(Tablet of Wang Jian)
When Yique was defeated,

253
00:18:51,725 --> 00:18:53,150
he used his hands

254
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,900
to hold up the city gate

255
00:18:55,475 --> 00:18:56,740
so that I could run away.

256
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,675
But he...

257
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,350
He was crumbled.

258
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:05,800
Look.

259
00:19:08,275 --> 00:19:09,825
In the Battle against West Chu,

260
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,540
we were

261
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,600
ten li away from the capital city.
[*li: unit of length, equals 500 meters.]

262
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,950
(Tablet of Zhao Changling)
Our counselor,

263
00:19:15,075 --> 00:19:16,580
(Tablet of Zhao Changling)
Zhao Changling, died.

264
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,600
If he walked ten li farther,

265
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:19,940
he would have

266
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,225
taken revenge for his whole family.

267
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,725
This man was gruff-voiced.

268
00:19:34,975 --> 00:19:36,675
But he loved to sing.

269
00:19:38,325 --> 00:19:39,340
Fan Li.

270
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:42,450
He died...

271
00:19:42,825 --> 00:19:44,820
He died too young.

272
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:04,775
Han Li.

273
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,075
He didn't commit a capital crime.

274
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,750
But to consolidate military disciplines,

275
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,325
I chopped off

276
00:20:11,925 --> 00:20:13,825
his head personally.

277
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,460
At that time,

278
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,800
I started with 600 cavalrymen.

279
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,275
Now,

280
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,200
all nations are in peace.

281
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,250
Our army

282
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,400
rules three states.

283
00:20:39,175 --> 00:20:40,975
But nearly all the 600 cavalrymen

284
00:20:42,425 --> 00:20:44,200
are here.

285
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,460
Why are there no sacrificial offerings?

286
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
No need.

287
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,250
They don't need such things.

288
00:21:02,225 --> 00:21:02,980
Son,

289
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:06,725
do you know

290
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,220
why I'm known

291
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,125
as Slayer?

292
00:21:12,725 --> 00:21:13,550
Because you've killed too many people.

293
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,225
Right.

294
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:17,675
There were many wars between nations.

295
00:21:18,325 --> 00:21:19,675
I've killed

296
00:21:19,675 --> 00:21:22,075
quite a lot of people
from aristocratic families.

297
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,380
So, everybody hates me

298
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,900
and treats me as a demon.

299
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,800
At present,

300
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,900
in Liyang,

301
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,340
the imperial examination system is used.

302
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,500
For people all over the world,

303
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,650
rich or poor,

304
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,300
there's hope.

305
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,700
If aristocratic families

306
00:21:51,175 --> 00:21:53,225
hadn't been eliminated,

307
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,425
believe it or not,

308
00:21:54,425 --> 00:21:58,420
officials would still
be recommended by them.

309
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:02,980
Think...

310
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,575
Think of the world

311
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,375
as a big tree.

312
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,100
Aristocratic families

313
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,100
turn out

314
00:22:11,975 --> 00:22:14,200
to be strong branches.

315
00:22:14,675 --> 00:22:16,975
They absorb all the sunlight.

316
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,650
The remaining majority of people

317
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,060
are like weeds under the tree

318
00:22:24,725 --> 00:22:27,925
which will gradually wither and rot.

319
00:22:28,975 --> 00:22:29,925
So,

320
00:22:31,425 --> 00:22:33,150
there can't be a new life

321
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,325
unless aristocratic families
are eliminated.

322
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,020
This is...

323
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,925
This is their dream.

324
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,575
It's my dream, too.

325
00:22:54,325 --> 00:22:56,060
Your eldest sister
was married to Jiangnan.

326
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:56,980
Your second eldest sister

327
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,220
went to Shangyin Academy.

328
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,860
They did that voluntarily.

329
00:23:01,325 --> 00:23:03,820
They would rather sacrifice their lives

330
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,940
to lay a foundation for North Liang.

331
00:23:09,025 --> 00:23:10,460
For the sake of the dead cavalrymen?

332
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,180
No.

333
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:13,460
Only for you.

334
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,020
For me?

335
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:16,540
They want to shelter you from trouble

336
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,420
so that

337
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,860
you can take over North Liang smoothly.

338
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,525
Have you thought about it?

339
00:23:26,325 --> 00:23:27,350
I hate

340
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,650
aristocratic families so much.

341
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,260
But why do I

342
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,460
still want our family
to rule North Liang?

343
00:23:33,675 --> 00:23:34,500
Why?

344
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,900
The royal family treats us
as a formidable enemy.

345
00:23:40,525 --> 00:23:42,025
In our army,

346
00:23:42,225 --> 00:23:43,620
there are many factions.

347
00:23:44,325 --> 00:23:46,340
If we no longer rule North Liang,

348
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,450
our army with 350 thousand soldiers

349
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,940
will cause chaos.

350
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,325
The peaceful world,

351
00:23:53,025 --> 00:23:54,750
which so many people died for,

352
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,650
will be ruined.

353
00:24:07,925 --> 00:24:09,780
Why didn't you tell me before?

354
00:24:13,275 --> 00:24:16,020
Until you want to take over North Liang,

355
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,580
I couldn't bring you here.

356
00:24:19,075 --> 00:24:19,980
Nor could I

357
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,980
explain to you.

358
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,900
I kind of understand.

359
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,300
You're not greedy for power.

360
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,020
Our families have been sacrificed

361
00:24:34,675 --> 00:24:35,675
for the dream

362
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,600
these people are after.

363
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,750
This is the responsibility
Weixiong told me.

364
00:24:41,425 --> 00:24:43,620
This is the real reason

365
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,125
why you must take over North Liang.

366
00:25:45,325 --> 00:25:47,325
(Tablet of General Peng Wanli,
of the 18th Battalion of Jinzhou)

367
00:25:47,325 --> 00:25:49,325
(Tablet of General Han Li,
of the 18th Battalion of Jinzhou)

368

(Tablet of General Zhang Hanfu,

369
00:25:51,225 --> 00:25:53,150
(Tablet of General Zhou Tujing,
of the 18th Battalion of Jinzhou)

370
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:17,325
I disagree.

371
00:26:18,675 --> 00:26:20,020
It's a very good dream

372
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,325
to seek peace for people

373
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:23,250
and stop wars for the world.

374
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,325
But I disagree with your methods.

375
00:26:26,025 --> 00:26:28,300
When you rule
by killing and playing tricks,

376
00:26:28,775 --> 00:26:30,620
do they still want such a North Liang?

377
00:26:30,825 --> 00:26:32,900
Don't be naive, will you?

378
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,400
Without killing,

379
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,300
how could we protect North Liang?

380
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,660
Isn't it too hard?

381
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,075
However hard it is,
we can't compromise.

382
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,220
I will take over North Liang,

383
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,940
but I will not go your way.

384
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,800
I will defend our dream,

385
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:48,600
and I'll protect my family, too.

386
00:26:50,425 --> 00:26:51,660
Can there be a perfect solution

387
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,100
for everything in the world?

388
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,725
Without a cruel heart,

389
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,225
you couldn't defend anything.

390
00:26:57,525 --> 00:26:58,500
I want to give it a try.

391
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:03,525
Fine.

392
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:05,140
I'll give you a chance

393
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:07,820
to confront the reality.

394
00:27:43,325 --> 00:27:44,700
Who opened the passageway?

395
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,125
His Lordship.

396
00:27:52,475 --> 00:27:53,225
Oh.

397
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,625
No problem, then.

398
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,500
About the passageway,

399
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,550
please do not

400
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,550
tell anyone else.

401
00:28:09,525 --> 00:28:10,260
I see.

402
00:28:10,975 --> 00:28:11,675
Mm.

403
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:14,010
I'll keep the secret for them.

404
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,580
Them?

405
00:28:21,925 --> 00:28:22,540
Wait.

406
00:28:22,825 --> 00:28:23,900
Who else went down?

407
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,525
Xu Fengnian.

408
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:29,050
Oh.

409
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,250
I have to get packed.

410
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,540
We'll have a long journey.

411
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,500
You want me to leave Lingzhou?

412
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,020
Where shall I go?

413
00:28:51,425 --> 00:28:53,800
Didn't you say you would go to Wudi City

414
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:55,500
and get back the sword box

415
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,900
for Old Huang?

416
00:28:58,075 --> 00:28:59,780
I only keep 60% to 70% of Dahuangting.

417
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,020
I can't defeat Wang Xianzhi for now.

418
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,260
You don't need to fight him

419
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,300
to get the sword box back.

420
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,260
Besides,

421
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:09,940
this is the route you must take
before you take over North Liang.

422
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,260
What does a trip to the martial world

423
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,500
have to do with taking over North Liang?

424
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,380
After the New Year,

425
00:29:14,725 --> 00:29:16,060
you're going to the martial world.

426
00:29:16,175 --> 00:29:17,620
I'm going to the capital city.

427
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,300
We'll leave together.

428
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,940
You're going to the capital city?

429
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:22,870
The biggest hurdle

430
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,050
for your taking over North Liang

431
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,750
lies in the court.

432
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,250
The throne of North Liang

433
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,200
should be hereditary.

434
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,125
But the court wanted
to abolish it long ago.

435
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:35,175
By then, North Liang
will fall into chaos.

436
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:38,750
I must get the throne for you

437
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,660
so that we can gain the upper hand.

438
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:42,925
The royal family isn't foolish.

439
00:29:42,925 --> 00:29:44,700
How will they let me take the throne?

440
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:47,180
I'll have everything arranged for you.

441
00:29:48,025 --> 00:29:48,780
By the way,

442
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,975
you miss your sisters and brother,
don't you?

443
00:29:51,225 --> 00:29:53,100
You'll have the chance

444
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,540
to meet your eldest sister

445
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,220
and second eldest sister.

446
00:29:55,275 --> 00:29:57,775
You can also visit Mount Longhu.

447
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:01,150
What exactly are you up to?

448
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:03,540
I'll make a deal with the court.

449
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,800
I'll get your sisters home

450
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,940
and cancel my arrangements

451
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,660
in Jiangnan and Shangyin Academy,

452
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,100
just to keep the chance

453
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,180
for your hereditary throne.

454
00:30:15,225 --> 00:30:17,780
You mean I can get sisters back?

455
00:30:19,925 --> 00:30:21,950
I'll have everything arranged for you.

456
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:23,200
What you have to do

457
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:25,300
is to make the final choice,

458
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:27,950
like you did on Mount Wudang.

459
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,620
What choice?

460
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,975
You'll decide how to get them back.

461
00:30:34,575 --> 00:30:35,660
Fengnian,

462
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,500
if many people have to die

463
00:30:38,775 --> 00:30:40,420
during the process

464
00:30:40,775 --> 00:30:42,620
before you get them back home,

465
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:44,460
what will you do?

466
00:30:46,075 --> 00:30:47,900
I'll come up with the third option.

467
00:30:49,475 --> 00:30:52,100
Not many people are like Old Huang.

468
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,260
People always come up
with destructive options.

469
00:30:56,525 --> 00:30:57,740
Where there's a will, there's a way.

470
00:31:01,175 --> 00:31:01,860
Good.

471
00:31:02,175 --> 00:31:03,300
I'll wait and see.

472
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,300
I'll wait and see.

473
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:09,340
Go up there alone.

474
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:12,060
I'd like to stay with them
for a bit longer.

475
00:31:31,775 --> 00:31:32,675
You...

476
00:31:32,675 --> 00:31:33,935
You heard him, didn't you?

477
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,620
Think about it.

478
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,220
What kind of father am I?

479
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,340
What kind?

480
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,340
But I...

481
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,220
I really believe that

482
00:31:52,225 --> 00:31:53,540
only when he has to

483
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,540
make a choice in the most difficult time

484
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,940
will he no longer be naive

485
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:57,900
and will he

486
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,925
grow up.

487
00:32:02,175 --> 00:32:03,125
Right?

488
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,220
Right?

489
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:12,980
Fine.

490
00:32:15,175 --> 00:32:16,620
Rest assured.

491
00:32:17,775 --> 00:32:19,300
I will make Fengnian

492
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:23,940
a qualified lord of North Liang

493
00:32:24,425 --> 00:32:26,600
so that he will defend the world

494
00:32:26,925 --> 00:32:28,340
for you

495
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,660
and for me!

496
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,025
(Tablet of General Zhao Changling,
of the 18th Battalion of Jinzhou)

497
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:42,500
(Tablet of General Chen Qiong,
of the 18th Battalion of Jinzhou)

498
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,875
(Tablet of General Wang Jian,
of the 18th Battalion of Jinzhou)

499
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,150
You must have heard us.

500
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:33,250
My son

501
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,460
insists on going to Wudi City,

502
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:39,025
to get back the sword box for Old Huang.

503
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,660
Childish.

504
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,900
But his trip

505
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,725
will certainly be very dangerous.

506
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,425
Someone should keep him company

507
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,425
and protect his life.

508
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,260
Even if he manages

509
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,780
to arrive in Wudi City safe and sound,

510
00:34:17,225 --> 00:34:19,380
when he meets Wang Xianzhi,

511
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,900
it's hard to tell if he'll still live.

512
00:34:23,025 --> 00:34:26,260
I heard that Wang Xianzhi has greatly
improved his martial arts.

513
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,875
That's awesome.

514
00:34:30,075 --> 00:34:32,275
If Fengnian acts on impulse

515
00:34:33,075 --> 00:34:34,820
and fights Wang Xianzhi,

516
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:38,260
he'll be dead.

517
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,180
Think about Wang Xianzhi.

518
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,820
Why does he kill everybody he meets?

519
00:34:54,975 --> 00:34:55,750
My Lord.

520
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,400
Mm.

521
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,860
Where are you going?

522
00:35:03,425 --> 00:35:04,740
Now that His Highness went down there,

523
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,620
I guess we're leaving soon.

524
00:35:08,425 --> 00:35:10,675
You're indeed experienced.

525
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:13,260
He'll leave after the New Year.

526
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:15,580
During the trip,

527
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:18,660
please take good care of him.

528
00:35:19,225 --> 00:35:19,925
Oh.

529
00:35:20,625 --> 00:35:21,660
I will.

530
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:23,300
What are you doing?

531
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,940
Put it back.

532
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,380
I'm leaving in a couple of days.

533
00:36:05,525 --> 00:36:06,820
You don't need to pack now.

534
00:36:07,675 --> 00:36:09,020
I need to pack carefully

535
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,300
for your trip.

536
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:13,850
Shall I read it or not?

537
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,820
Not for today.

538
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:17,900
You lied to me.

539
00:36:19,275 --> 00:36:20,580
Visit someone with me tomorrow.

540
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,740
I'll pay you.

541
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:22,580
How much?

542
00:36:24,625 --> 00:36:25,620
This is half of the amount.

543
00:36:30,225 --> 00:36:31,700
Prepare some presents for me.

544
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,780
Take them with us tomorrow.

545
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,075
Tomorrow is New Year's Eve.

546
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,600
Everybody will be staying
with his family.

547
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,860
If you want to visit someone,

548
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,700
you'd better go
after the first day of New Year.

549
00:36:40,775 --> 00:36:42,700
Not everybody has a family.

550
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,425
(Pastry, Pancakes)

551
00:36:51,425 --> 00:36:52,625
It's crooked.

552
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,460
Xu?

553
00:36:55,925 --> 00:36:57,725
Put it straight for me.

554
00:36:58,850 --> 00:36:59,550
Ouch.

555
00:37:00,025 --> 00:37:00,825
Ouch.

556
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,000
Oh, no.

557
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:05,340
Be seated.

558
00:37:05,725 --> 00:37:06,660
Bring the presents in.

559
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,100
Put them on the table.

560
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,100
Light the stove.

561
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:11,800
Oh.

562
00:37:12,675 --> 00:37:14,025
But I can't light a stove.

563
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,925
Still that girl?

564
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:18,900
Have you

565
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,460
got married yet?

566
00:37:20,475 --> 00:37:21,300
No.

567
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,540
We're not a couple.

568
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,740
I've brought some food for you.

569
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,940
Hope you'll like it.

570
00:37:26,325 --> 00:37:27,450
Thank you.

571
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:29,060
But didn't I tell you?

572
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,700
Before every New Year,

573
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:34,075
the government has a lot of food
delivered to me.

574
00:37:34,075 --> 00:37:35,420
I can't finish it.

575
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,600
Keep it, then.

576
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:38,500
The deliveryman from the government

577
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,100
said the same thing.

578
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,225
Old Xu.

579
00:37:44,225 --> 00:37:44,825
What?

580
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,950
I heard you worked for Xu Xiao
for many years.

581
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,500
You can't call him by his name.

582
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,260
Right. Right.

583
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,220
General Xu.

584
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,100
Grand Commander.

585
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:52,800
Yes.

586
00:37:53,725 --> 00:37:54,660
Do you remember

587
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,150
why you started to work for him?

588
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,740
At first,

589
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,100
I worked for him to make a living.

590
00:38:01,725 --> 00:38:02,925
I expected

591
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:04,775
the peace of the world

592
00:38:05,225 --> 00:38:07,125
and the justice in the world.

593
00:38:07,525 --> 00:38:09,020
There's no such thing as justice.

594
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,325
Don't say that.

595
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,180
This spring,

596
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,775
a student

597
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,250
from a poor family

598
00:38:16,425 --> 00:38:18,305
passed the imperial examination,
didn't he?

599
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,340
But those who passed
the imperial examination

600
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,620
are mostly from rich families.

601
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,775
That's enough.

602
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,900
God bless North Liang, I hope,

603
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,225
so that we can keep

604
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,200
the peace of the world.

605
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,350
I will

606
00:38:36,225 --> 00:38:37,475
maintain the peace for you.

607
00:38:39,825 --> 00:38:40,820
Xu,

608
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,875
are you drunk

609
00:38:43,225 --> 00:38:44,800
with too much Tusu Wine?

610
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,000
What do you think
if I become the Lord of North Liang?

611
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,700
You think you're better
than Chen Zhibao?

612
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:00,900
Actually, I thought about

613
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,525
letting Chen Zhibao
take over North Liang.

614
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,600
But now I understand.

615
00:39:05,175 --> 00:39:06,020
He can't do that.

616
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:07,460
Why?

617
00:39:08,275 --> 00:39:10,175
He looks calm.

618
00:39:10,375 --> 00:39:11,660
But deep in his heart,

619
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,125
he's seething with hatred.

620
00:39:13,425 --> 00:39:14,780
He's got something in his mind.

621
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,300
If he takes over North Liang,

622
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,725
wars will resume.

623
00:39:19,175 --> 00:39:21,060
The peaceful world Old Xu and others
have been fighting for

624
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,175
will be ruined.

625
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,140
You sound
as if you could keep the peace.

626
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:30,540
What?

627
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,220
It's the New Year.

628
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,050
A present for you.

629
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:35,700
You're the son of the Lord.

630
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,250
But you only gave me a string?

631
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,050
Expensive presents don't suit you.

632
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,900
They do.

633
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,550
Give it back to me if you don't want it.

634
00:39:44,225 --> 00:39:45,150
Why do I not want it?

635
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,380
When I sell it,

636
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,220
maybe I'll make a coin.

637
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,300
You're Miss Fan beside Mr. Lin,

638
00:40:03,775 --> 00:40:04,980
aren't you?

639
00:40:06,275 --> 00:40:07,775
Xu Xiao released you?

640
00:40:08,975 --> 00:40:10,140
For your information, Your Highness,

641
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:11,420
I'm Shu Xiu.

642
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,940
Shu for comfortable and Xiu for shy.

643
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,140
It's a friendly name.

644
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:19,020
Miss Fan is an alias?

645
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,420
It's cautious of you, Your Highness.

646
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,300
Don't worry.

647
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,180
It's nontoxic.

648
00:40:35,675 --> 00:40:38,975
His Lordship said
you always wanted perfect solutions.

649
00:40:39,625 --> 00:40:40,940
After Ning Emei was back,

650
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,220
he was locked up in the dungeon.

651
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,275
He should have been executed.

652
00:40:44,825 --> 00:40:46,375
Now that you want a perfect solution,

653
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:48,275
you will decide

654
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,775
whether he lives or dies.

655
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,175
You're indeed cautious, Your Highness.

656
00:41:08,325 --> 00:41:09,025
By the way,

657
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:10,950
I'd like to remind you.

658
00:41:11,525 --> 00:41:13,740
You didn't bring back
Young Master Longxiang from Wudang.

659
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,580
Ning Emei complained about that.

660
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,675
You didn't bring back
Young Master Longxiang?

661
00:41:44,925 --> 00:41:46,300
He was sent to Mount Longhu.

662
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,675
Mount Longhu?

663
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,660
It means he's been delivered
into the hand of the royal family.

664
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,950
No matter what I've done,

665
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:53,050
I don't care

666
00:41:53,325 --> 00:41:54,375
whether you believe me

667
00:41:54,725 --> 00:41:55,625
or not.

668
00:41:56,525 --> 00:41:57,750
The point is...

669
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,100
Do you want to see Huangman'er?

670
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,340
He's been sent to Mount Longhu.

671
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,300
How can I see him again?

672
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,450
I'll go on a trip after the New Year.

673
00:42:05,925 --> 00:42:07,200
I'll pass through Mount Longhu.

674
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,400
Would you like to go with me?

675
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,175
Yes.

676
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,000
I'll get Young Master Longxiang
back to North Liang.

677
00:42:28,325 --> 00:42:29,375
Go back home for recuperation.

678
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:30,925
We're leaving after the New Year.

679
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,875
Xu Xiao keeps saying

680
00:42:39,875 --> 00:42:41,460
that we shouldn't forget
the dead 600 cavalrymen.

681
00:42:42,925 --> 00:42:44,275
But every day,

682
00:42:44,275 --> 00:42:47,140
he only cares for factional struggles.

683
00:42:48,475 --> 00:42:50,125
Even I feel sorry for Old Xu.
