1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

5
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
=Sword Snow Stride=
(Season 1)

6
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,400
=Episode 11=

7
00:02:34,225 --> 00:02:36,100
This is the transmission of Dahuangting.

8
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,110
Sure enough, Wudang has
pledged allegiance to North Liang.

9
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,120
Your Grace.

10
00:02:43,175 --> 00:02:44,400
This is our chance now.

11
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,900
How is that?

12
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,900
If we stop them now,

13
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,100
the internal force will render
Xu Fengnian's meridians disorderly,

14
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,750
and he will be ruined.

15
00:02:52,225 --> 00:02:53,300
Just a moment, Your Grace.

16
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,525
But if you do this,

17
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,075
Xu Xiao will hate you.

18
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,125
How can we depend on Xu Xiao?

19
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,525
Good.

20
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,110
If you make it,

21
00:03:04,335 --> 00:03:05,575
the court will issue a decree

22
00:03:05,575 --> 00:03:06,975
and make you the master of Wudang.

23
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,540
Thanks.

24
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,125
Let's do it together.

25
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,865
Who is that?

26
00:03:50,825 --> 00:03:52,145
Brother Wang.

27
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,460
How did you come out
of the Purple Bamboo Forest?

28
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:56,940
Don't go any farther.

29
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,340
If we don't stop them,

30
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,780
Master Chonglou will lose all his force.

31
00:04:11,575 --> 00:04:14,535
It's his own decision.

32
00:04:24,675 --> 00:04:26,035
There isn't much time left.

33
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,300
It's done.

34
00:05:36,675 --> 00:05:37,580
It's too late.

35
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,340
Your Grace.

36
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,580
It's destined that it can't be done.

37
00:05:49,525 --> 00:05:50,575
Let's go.

38
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,580
You ruined Wudang!

39
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,300
Little Taoist.

40
00:05:56,725 --> 00:05:58,085
Do you want to come down with us?

41
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:01,770
Your Grace.

42
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,575
I won't go with you.

43
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,025
Master Chonglou lost all his force.

44
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,925
Wudang will elect a new master.

45
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,275
I'd like to try it.

46
00:06:09,675 --> 00:06:10,875
If I could be the master,

47
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,615
maybe I could turn the tide.

48
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,100
Very good.

49
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,540
Rest assured.

50
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,260
The court will fully support you
to take over Wudang.

51
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,575
Thank you, Your Grace.

52
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,400
Xu Fengnian will wake up soon.

53
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,875
Please leave as soon as possible.

54
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,075
Um.

55
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,450
You acted well.

56
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,050
There was more action than talk.

57
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,550
It was not that difficult.

58
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,875
Let's check Master Chonglou.

59
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,220
Master Chonglou.

60
00:07:32,325 --> 00:07:33,700
Did it go well?

61
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,750
The Princess should have believed it.

62
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,675
Use the force of North Liang
as a deterrent to Mount Longhu,

63
00:07:41,075 --> 00:07:43,150
then with the support of the capital,

64
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,660
it will be a sure thing

65
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,800
for you to take over Wudang.

66
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,300
Master Chonglou.

67
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,550
Don't be sullen.

68
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,540
Use my Dahuangting

69
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,350
to change for the future for Wudang.

70
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,380
It's worth it.

71
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,425
Do you know why

72
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,575
the Shentu Sword

73
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,575
was given to you?

74
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,300
To guard Wudang.

75
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,075
The world is turbulent.

76
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,825
Before you become the best in the world,

77
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,325
we must count on you

78
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,500
to guard Wudang

79
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,650
with this mahogany sword.

80
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,575
I'll live and die

81
00:08:30,425 --> 00:08:31,300
with Wudang.

82
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,925
You go up first.

83
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,050
Gather your fellow apprentices.

84
00:08:40,275 --> 00:08:42,175
I have something to say.

85
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,225
What about you, Master Chonglou?

86
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,275
I'll wait for him to wake up.

87
00:08:49,775 --> 00:08:50,660
Go ahead.

88
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:17,900
Your Grace.

89
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,700
We've seen no pursuers.

90
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,100
Let's go back to the capital now.

91
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,340
Yes, Your Grace.

92
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,025
Should we send a message

93
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,300
to the capital right now

94
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,580
that Xu Fengnian got the internal force?

95
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,700
Xu Fengnian is nothing but a fool.

96
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,620
So what that he acquired martial arts?

97
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,225
In terms of the momentum of history,

98
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,940
one person's capability

99
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,900
is not worth mentioning.

100
00:09:40,525 --> 00:09:42,075
You are quite right, Your Grace.

101
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,180
Send the message about Wudang back now.

102
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,300
One thing is for sure

103
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,540
that Wudang has defected to North Liang.

104
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,860
Ask Mount Longhu
not to be too aggressive.

105
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,650
We can't provoke Xu Xiao

106
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,610
just for a little sect.

107
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,125
Yes, Your Grace.

108
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,940
I will send a message
to the capital immediately.

109
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:57,812
Um.

110
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,250
And also,

111
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,460
Hong Xixiang's heart
is with the capital.

112
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,780
We should support him

113
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,850
to take over Wudang.

114
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,250
Why are my clothes not wet?

115
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,550
The water has been evaporated.

116
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,825
You lit a fire?

117
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,500
The genuine spirit works better
than fire.

118
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,300
You've passed Dahuangting to me?

119
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,450
Yes.

120
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,300
I don't feel any difference.

121
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,350
Looks like you are compatible with
my genuine spirit.

122
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,350
As for how much of the genuine spirit
you can keep,

123
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,475
it depends on your fate.

124
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,850
Thank you.

125
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,675
You want to go up to the mountain?

126
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,660
Let me help you.

127
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,875
Thank you.

128
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,650
In order to protect Wudang,

129
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,525
I threw

130
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:22,825
my life away.

131
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,150
Wudang

132
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,260
is not a big sect,
but it's not small, either.

133
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:32,175
It's even hard for us
to survive in this world.

134
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,275
How hard the lives would be

135
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,450
for the common people?

136
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,900
If one day

137
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,980
you take over North Liang,

138
00:12:49,275 --> 00:12:51,260
please

139
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,420
consider them.

140
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:56,850
I will.

141
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,100
Why are you waiting here?

142
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,400
To help you go up the mountain.

143
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,500
Good.

144
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,175
Then I won't trouble Your Highness.

145
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,700
Yeah.

146
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,125
It's almost the end of the year.

147
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,925
You should go back to North Liang.

148
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,025
You knew about
the passing of Dahuangting?

149
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,500
Please

150
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,060
don't waste it.

151
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,725
I'll wait for the news
that you set foot in Wudi City.

152
00:13:26,175 --> 00:13:27,400
Come on.

153
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,725
Your Grace.

154
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,175
Um.

155
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,660
I'll get some hot water

156
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,350
to make tea for you.

157
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,250
Why are you following me?

158
00:14:11,525 --> 00:14:13,540
You should guard Her Grace now!

159
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,275
Yes.

160
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,025
Fill it with hot water.

161
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,400
How is it going?

162
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,000
Things have changed.

163
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,825
What happened?

164
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,850
That person was taken away
by the people of Mount Longhu.

165
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,580
It should be written by Jian Jiuhuang.

166
00:14:40,925 --> 00:14:41,925
And His Highness...

167
00:14:41,925 --> 00:14:42,940
What's wrong with His Highness?

168
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,380
Wang Chonglou

169
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,860
passed Dahuangting to him.

170
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,475
Princess Suizhu has believed

171
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,400
that Wudang has pledged allegiance
to North Liang.

172
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,350
To protect themselves?

173
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,275
Aside from this accident,

174
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,320
everything else went on
just as you expected.

175
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,100
Princess Suizhu

176
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,700
saw with her own eyes that His Highness
is obstreperous and stupid.

177
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,875
From now on,

178
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,955
the capital won't be wary of
His Highness.

179
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:10,300
By the way.

180
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,925
Father wants me to ask you

181
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,725
if you want to find a chance

182
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,025
to go back to North Liang.

183
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,940
My stay in the capital

184
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,125
will help His Lordship more.

185
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,650
Thank you.

186
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,350
I'll leave.

187
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,400
Your Grace.

188
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,350
We are ready to go.

189
00:15:39,075 --> 00:15:40,050
Did you pay for it?

190
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,150
Yes.

191
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,100
Five pennies.

192
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,050
It's not easy for these people.

193
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,660
Send five more pennies to the owner.

194
00:15:56,402 --> 00:15:59,543
(Tea)

195
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:00,800
Sir.

196
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,100
Is there anything else I can do for you?

197
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,700
Your tip.

198
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,700
Thank you very much.

199
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,260
Your Grace.

200
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,550
The money has been given to him.

201
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:24,975
Let's go.

202
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:25,800
Yes.

203
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,475
Sun Diaosi is right.

204
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,660
Princess Suizhu

205
00:16:40,175 --> 00:16:42,025
is suspicious deep down

206
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,050
in spite of her unruly behavior.

207
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,620
Don't leave anything!

208
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,050
Burn everything you see!

209
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:57,860
Let's go to Wudang

210
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,175
and take His Highness home!

211
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,950
Wang Chonglou is daring indeed.

212
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,100
I wasn't expecting this, either.

213
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,375
Two months is up.

214
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,000
I should probably leave.

215
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,100
You won't go back
to North Liang with me?

216
00:17:47,475 --> 00:17:49,825
Everyone has his path.

217
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,325
We have to say goodbye

218
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,000
to those we meet on the way.

219
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,600
This is the world of martial arts.

220
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,275
Thank you for your teachings.

221
00:18:18,025 --> 00:18:19,275
Keep practicing martial arts.

222
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,400
Maybe we will meet again.

223
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,450
I'm leaving.

224
00:19:05,284 --> 00:19:08,540
(Sanqing Hall)

225
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,650
Here you are.

226
00:19:10,075 --> 00:19:11,155
- Master.
- Master.

227
00:19:12,575 --> 00:19:13,425
Good.

228
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,550
From today on,

229
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,525
Wudang has

230
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,425
survived the calamity of extermination.

231
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,875
I only have one thing to tell you.

232
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,950
After my death,

233
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,825
Hong Xixiang

234
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,425
will take over Wudang
and become the master.

235
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,500
Master Chonglou.

236
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,475
I think I can't erase it.

237
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,900
This is Dahuangting.

238
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,350
Jiang Ni.

239
00:20:32,925 --> 00:20:35,500
Do you think
I shouldn't have come to Wudang?

240
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,340
Don't complain
when it's in your interest.

241
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,925
Pass it to me if you don't want it.

242
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,450
I'll die if I pass it to you.

243
00:20:47,725 --> 00:20:48,885
That would be the best.

244
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,500
Besides, I don't know how to pass it.

245
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,850
Your Highness!

246
00:21:08,325 --> 00:21:09,375
Your Highness!

247
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,525
Your Highness, have you missed me?

248
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,750
I miss you so much!

249
00:21:17,825 --> 00:21:18,775
Your Highness!

250
00:21:18,775 --> 00:21:19,875
Jiang Ni.

251
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,700
It's time to go home.

252
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,450
Your Highness!

253
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:27,975
Your Highness!

254
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,750
Fatty Lushan is coming!

255
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,775
You can stay here
for a few more days if you want.

256
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,125
Your Highness!

257
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,925
That won't be necessary.

258
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,450
Master Wang said

259
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,000
it will take him too long
to go down the mountain,

260
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,125
so he won't come to bid farewell.

261
00:22:13,975 --> 00:22:15,350
Tell him for me

262
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,940
I won't forget

263
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,950
what I owe Wudang.

264
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,400
Um.

265
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,875
This is Wudang's book
on practicing genuine spirit.

266
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,025
(Treatise of the Most Exalted One)
You have Dahuangting now.

267
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,375
(Treatise of the Most Exalted One)
It might help you.

268
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,600
Goodbye then.

269
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,050
Here is one thing.

270
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,820
Don't tear down the hut

271
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,700
and grow some vegetables for me

272
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,125
in the garden.

273
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,325
What kind of vegetables?

274
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,875
Just like before.

275
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,800
Do you want me
to steal vegetables again?

276
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,675
You're the next master.

277
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,800
It's not hard.

278
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,875
You'd better leave now.

279
00:23:16,275 --> 00:23:17,060
What?

280
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,400
Do you know how to ride a horse?

281
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,300
I don't. So what?

282
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,275
Nothing.

283
00:23:26,275 --> 00:23:26,925
Eh!

284
00:23:28,275 --> 00:23:29,620
Get down!

285
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,140
How do you go back to North Liang

286
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,300
if I get down?

287
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,525
I'll learn by myself.

288
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,675
I've restored the hut
and the garden for you.

289
00:23:38,775 --> 00:23:40,260
It has nothing to do with me.

290
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,850
I have one more thing
to ask you before I leave!

291
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,475
Go ahead.

292
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,150
When exactly are you going to Jiangnan?

293
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,725
You don't even have the courage
to see my sister?

294
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,825
When I become the best in the world,

295
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,180
I will be able to go down the mountain.

296
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,250
After I go down the mountain,

297
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,625
I'll go to see her.

298
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,725
The best in the world?

299
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,980
How long will it take?

300
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,350
It's gonna happen.

301
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:11,980
Let's go back to North Liang.

302
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,740
They've left.

303
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,700
Um.

304
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,150
They asked you to go to Jiangnan?

305
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,380
Master Chonglou.

306
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,850
I do like Xu Zhihu.

307
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:48,450
Um.

308
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,225
But I also like Wudang.

309
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:51,580
I'm not going to leave here

310
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,975
until I become the best in the world.

311
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,450
It must be hard for you.

312
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,550
It's not hard.

313
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,800
I'm just worried

314
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,125
that you place all your hope on me,

315
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,100
but what if I can't be
the best in the world?

316
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:12,275
Eh?

317
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,660
We haven't had a match for years.

318
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:19,925
Well.

319
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,425
Why don't we do it today?

320
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,050
I don't think it's a good idea.

321
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,775
Are you scared?

322
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,620
Let's do it then.

323
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:31,850
Okay.

324
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,725
Well, Master Chonglou.

325
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:54,150
I'm more energetic than you, right?

326
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:58,100
I don't have Dahuangting anymore.

327
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,525
That was a glorious defeat.

328
00:26:00,975 --> 00:26:02,460
What does that

329
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,550
have anything to do with Dahuangting?

330
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,180
Xixiang.

331
00:26:11,775 --> 00:26:14,050
Just feel free to be yourself.

332
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,260
Our master and I won't make a mistake.

333
00:26:18,025 --> 00:26:20,740
You will be the best in the world.

334
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,180
When you come down the mountain,

335
00:26:25,025 --> 00:26:26,660
you must leave in a grand way

336
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,220
and make me

337
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,780
look good!

338
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,020
Okay!

339
00:26:37,275 --> 00:26:38,860
The best in the world!

340
00:26:58,042 --> 00:27:02,725
(Apricot Flower Wine Shop)

341
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,975
You're finally back, Your Highness.

342
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,850
Is this the mark of Dahuangting?

343
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,775
It looks good on you.

344
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:23,150
Do you all know it?

345
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,300
We got the message.

346
00:27:25,575 --> 00:27:27,650
Congratulations on being endowed with
civil and martial virtues.

347
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,780
You must be tired.

348
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,900
Please get inside and have some rest.

349
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,500
Eh?

350
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,775
Why are you all waiting outside?

351
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,875
Something happened in the mansion.

352
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,475
Let's go inside first.

353
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:51,275
Son.

354
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,825
You are finally back.

355
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,175
Wang Chonglou

356
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,725
is decisive indeed.

357
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,325
He actually passed
his Dahuangting to you.

358
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:06,325
Never mind.

359
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,675
Never mind.

360
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,860
You must be hungry now.

361
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,625
Look what I got for you.

362
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:11,900
There are more.

363
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,380
I found this good stuff for you.

364
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,650
I don't want to eat.

365
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,875
What happened in the mansion?

366
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:18,035
What are you doing here?

367
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,200
Your Highness.

368
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,780
It's nothing serious.

369
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,140
Just to stay away from trouble.

370
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,100
Stay away from trouble?

371
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,625
The Lord of North Liang came here
to stay away from trouble?

372
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,425
Is there a ghost in the mansion?

373
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,580
I wish

374
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,775
it was a ghost.

375
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:33,050
Your second sister is back.

376
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,275
You told her
that I'm learning martial arts?

377
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,775
Do I need to tell her?

378
00:28:40,775 --> 00:28:42,300
The whole world knows it now.

379
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:44,780
I'd better go back to Wudang
and stay there for a few days.

380
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,875
Wait, wait, you can't leave.

381
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,250
Listen.

382
00:28:48,425 --> 00:28:49,460
I've told her

383
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,940
that you're on your way back
to North Liang.

384
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,300
She is waiting for you at home.

385
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,540
Xu Xiao!

386
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,650
You sold me out!

387
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,075
I have to save

388
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,000
one of us.

389
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,875
It's not necessary.

390
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,475
Do you see her?

391
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,925
She should be in my yard.

392
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,580
Go back to your rooms.

393
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,540
I'll go to see her myself.

394
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,275
Stay here!

395
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,575
(Xu Weixiong, the second daughter
of the Lord of North Liang)

396
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,800
You're back to spend the New Year?

397
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,060
(Artificers' Record)
I made you a set of pieces with rocks

398
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,650
(Artificers' Record)
in Wudang.

399
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,450
Take a look.

400
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,700
You must be tired of reading.

401
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,900
Let me massage your shoulders.

402
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,150
Are you getting used to

403
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,440
the life at Shangyin Academy?

404
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,300
I heard you are learning martial arts.

405
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,075
Old Huang died in Wudi City.

406
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,825
I want to take his sword box back.

407
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,675
You think it's bad
to learn martial arts?

408
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,175
- It's up to you.
- Um.

409
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,180
I just didn't expect

410
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,675
that Old Huang is more important to you

411
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,700
than North Liang.

412
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,900
Why do you say that?

413
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,625
Right now,

414
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,175
you haven't even decided
to take over the army of Xu.

415
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,540
I don't think I'm up to

416
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,700
such an important task.

417
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,340
Enough!

418
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,100
Weixiong.

419
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,740
You can do

420
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,500
whatever you want.

421
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,150
Thank you for being so generous.

422
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,900
Where are you going?

423
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,625
(Wutong House)

424
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:37,900
Don't be mad.

425
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,380
I'll go back to Shangyin Academy
right now.

426
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,060
I won't be angry

427
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,075
if I don't see you.

428
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,875
You're going back now?

429
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,725
Not to spend the New Year at home?

430
00:31:47,475 --> 00:31:49,020
I made it for you in person.

431
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,125
Take a look, at least.

432
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,150
I've seen it.

433
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,375
I'm not a kid anymore!

434
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,180
You all want me
to take over North Liang!

435
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,500
Have you asked me if I want to?

436
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,100
Who are you to say no?

437
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,575
Everyone should have the right
to decide how to live his life!

438
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,800
You know nothing!

439
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,225
Your life is totally wasted!

440
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,500
You can't even see your responsibility!

441
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,675
Why are you here?

442
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,875
I heard that you tried
to kill Xu Fengnian again.

443
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,500
You're afraid to admit it?

444
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,000
Yes.

445
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,850
I did try to kill him.

446
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:42,060
Let me warn you.

447
00:33:42,975 --> 00:33:44,700
Don't forget who you are.

448
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,675
Well.

449
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,275
A maid can't assassinate
the son of a lord?

450
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,900
I'll say it one last time.

451
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,275
If you hurt Xu Fengnian,

452
00:33:59,975 --> 00:34:01,855
I'll throw you into a well

453
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,680
and close it.

454
00:34:04,725 --> 00:34:06,600
You'll just rot in the well

455
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,850
and never see the sun again.

456
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,225
If you understand my words,

457
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,250
write it down

458
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,600
and swear

459
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,100
that you will never
try to kill Xu Fengnian again.

460
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,525
Okay.

461
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,375
You want me to write it down?

462
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:22,950
Bring me a brush.

463
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,060
The bigger, the better.

464
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,075
Remember what I said.

465
00:34:33,675 --> 00:34:34,900
I, Xu Weixiong,

466
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,175
am a person

467
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,850
of my words.

468
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,075
What a coincidence,

469
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,600
so am I.

470
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:23,025
(Xu Fengnian)

471
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,020
Miss Weixiong rode away

472
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,425
and left Lingzhou.

473
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,140
She came and left like the wind.

474
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,100
It turns out

475
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,750
she came all the way back

476
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,325
just to scold me.

477
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,250
Miss Weixiong has
high expectations for you.

478
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,180
She is the first prodigy

479
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,200
at Shangyin Academy for decades.

480
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,925
I'm no match for her,

481
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,350
and I don't want to learn it.

482
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,200
Did Jiang Ni write it?

483
00:36:55,425 --> 00:36:56,125
Um.

484
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,800
Her handwriting is good.

485
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,500
Chen Zhibao.

486
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,450
You should have learnt a lot

487
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,450
at Shangyin Academy.

488
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,150
Why do you care

489
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,450
what I learnt?

490
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,620
You've learnt so much,

491
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,050
but you are still so brutal.

492
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,820
I think Shangyin Academy
is a good place for you.

493
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,650
So?

494
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,575
So, you don't need
to come back to North Liang

495
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,800
if there is nothing important.

496
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,650
Do you think I'm the cause of the chaos?

497
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:51,925
Father.

498
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,100
Chen Zhibao left the camp alone

499
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,725
and stopped Miss Weixiong
outside the city.

500
00:37:55,725 --> 00:37:56,400
Um.

501
00:37:59,060 --> 00:37:59,850
Father.

502
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,475
Should we dispatch soldiers?

503
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:02,540
They haven't seen each other
for a long time.

504
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,550
Don't disturb them.

505
00:38:52,075 --> 00:38:59,075
(Jiang Ni swears to kill Xu Fengnian)

506
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,375
Why do you want to see me?

507
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,125
Where is the mark of Dahuangting?

508
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,380
There is no mark on Wang Chonglou

509
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,550
when he doesn't use his force.

510
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,675
What is this?

511
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,925
It's Wudang's
Treatise of the Most Exalted One.

512
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,425
Hong Xixiang gave it to me.

513
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,650
It's for you.

514
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:35,095
I don't have Dahuangting.

515
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,100
I'm too lazy to read.

516
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,575
Why don't you read it to me?

517
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,225
Don't even think about it.

518
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,800
I'll give you one penny

519
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:41,850
for each word.

520
00:39:42,525 --> 00:39:43,850
One penny?

521
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,525
One penny for each word.

522
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,340
Two pennies.

523
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,450
Just one penny.

524
00:39:50,725 --> 00:39:51,725
(Treatise of the Most Exalted One)

525
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,860
If you read more books,

526
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,125
it can still cost me all of my money.

527
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,750
There is more than one book?

528
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:56,950
Think about it.

529
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,400
I want to learn martial arts,

530
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,900
so, I have to read books.

531
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,575
Let's just use this book as an example.

532
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,700
I asked Hongshu to roughly count it.

533
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,675
It's about 6,000 words.

534
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,550
After you read the whole book,

535
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,830
I'll pay you seven strings of pennies

536
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,550
to make a good start.

537
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,260
It's to your profit.

538
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,525
(Treatise of the Most Exalted One)

539
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,025
Pay me every time
after I finish one book.

540
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:27,950
Okay.

541
00:40:34,425 --> 00:40:35,950
There was something
undefined and complete,

542
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,350
coming into existence
before Heaven and Earth.

543
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,180
How still it was and formless,

544
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,380
abstruse and profound,

545
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,620
standing alone.

546
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,740
Too rigid.

547
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,350
Read it with emotions.

548
00:40:46,275 --> 00:40:48,740
There was something
undefined and complete,

549
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,020
coming into existence
before Heaven and Earth.

550
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,275
Be more sedate.

551
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,675
What do you want?

552
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,075
I pay you to read for me.

553
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,180
Shouldn't you read it well?

554
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,475
I'm going out now.

555
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,300
Keep reading

556
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,550
and think about

557
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,900
the best way to read it.

558
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,580
I'll listen to it when I come back.

559
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,450
Your handwriting is good.

560
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,275
It's okay.

561
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,700
My second sister snapped at you,

562
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,800
but you swore to kill me.

563
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,350
Is that appropriate?

564
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,125
Xu Weixiong cares about you the most.

565
00:41:31,775 --> 00:41:33,060
She wouldn't care
if I swear to kill her.

566
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,020
She cares about me?

567
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,820
She came all the way back

568
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,075
just to scold me.

569
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,975
That's because
she is too disappointed in you.

570
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,260
Why does she

571
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,250
want me to take over
North Liang so badly?

572
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,140
What question is that?

573
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,775
My second sister hates

574
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,675
the inheriting system the most.

575
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,460
She wants me to take over North Liang

576
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,400
certainly not for continuing
the bloodline of the Xu family.

577
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,425
She must have other reasons.

578
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,225
Then why don't you want to take over

579
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,650
North Liang?

580
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,475
I don't want to see

581
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,800
people keep dying for this thing.

582
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,100
But if you don't do anything,

583
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,740
doesn't it mean
that they die for nothing?

584
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,450
