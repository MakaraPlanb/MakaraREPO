1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

5
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
=Sword Snow Stride=
(Season 1)

6
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,400
=Episode 31=

7
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,959
His Highness is going up the mountain.

8
00:01:36,225 --> 00:01:37,280
Please make way.

9
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,920
Won't you fight?

10
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:49,519
The kid wishes to enjoy the view

11
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,760
and it has nothing to do with me.

12
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,040
Why would I help him?

13
00:01:53,575 --> 00:01:54,560
Your Highness,

14
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,599
pardon me.

15
00:01:56,025 --> 00:01:56,875
Stop!

16
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,760
Let him go up the mountain.

17
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,950
You're in no position to give orders.

18
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,079
It's Old Ancestor's order

19
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,040
that Xu Fengnian goes up Guniujiang.

20
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:07,799
It's Old Ancestor's order?

21
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,750
How would I dare to lie to you?

22
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:19,639
Get out of the way.

23
00:02:21,025 --> 00:02:22,199
I'll lead the way.

24
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:43,840
Go.

25
00:02:49,425 --> 00:02:52,125
(Mount Hui Snowfield Guniujiang)

26
00:02:58,325 --> 00:03:00,319
Here I am at last.

27
00:03:10,075 --> 00:03:11,800
I, Xuanyuan Jingcheng,

28
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,300
ask to see you, Old Ancestor.

29
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,750
(Xuanyuan Dapan,
Old Ancestor of the Xuanyuan Family)

30
00:03:37,975 --> 00:03:39,960
Xuanyuan Dapan doesn't know
that I'm going up the mountain, right?

31
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,599
You made it up?

32
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,725
If he's dead,

33
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:45,350
no one will know it.

34
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:47,599
What if he lives?

35
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,719
Then everything's over.

36
00:03:50,275 --> 00:03:51,925
Who would care about a lie by then?

37
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:53,300
Old man.

38
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:53,960
Hey.

39
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,560
Do you think
she's got a better figure than me?

40
00:03:56,525 --> 00:03:57,500
She was raised well.

41
00:03:57,925 --> 00:03:58,879
She's better than you.

42
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,120
So what?

43
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,639
I'm still growing.

44
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:05,000
It's fine.

45
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,280
Xu Fengnian doesn't care about that.

46
00:04:07,525 --> 00:04:09,159
I don't care how he feels.

47
00:04:12,525 --> 00:04:14,050
It's been many years.

48
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,279
I underestimated you.

49
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:19,000
You came because of your daughter?

50
00:04:20,725 --> 00:04:23,279
The hundred-year prestige
of the Xuanyuan Family

51
00:04:24,575 --> 00:04:27,000
has been maintained by you.

52
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,550
I, on behalf
of the entire Xuanyuan Family,

53
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,350
thank you.

54
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,079
Your daughter

55
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,800
is the thank-you gift.

56
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,560
But it's a wrong way.

57
00:04:45,925 --> 00:04:47,200
So what if it's wrong?

58
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,120
Here I challenge you.

59
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,480
Jingcheng,

60
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:56,959
have you read the resonance
of the sky and the earth yet?

61
00:04:57,225 --> 00:04:58,350
Do you know

62
00:04:58,475 --> 00:04:59,920
which stage

63
00:05:00,225 --> 00:05:02,759
is the Celestial Realm?

64
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:08,775
Whether it's Celestial Realm or not,

65
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,750
you'll see after the fight.

66
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,879
I'd like to see

67
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,079
if you can withstand
over a hundred moves.

68
00:05:43,325 --> 00:05:44,319
What's happening?

69
00:05:44,475 --> 00:05:46,040
Who is fighting with Old Ancestor?

70
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,079
It has begun.

71
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,759
Who do you think will win?

72
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,279
I, of course, wish my father wins.

73
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,399
But Xuanyuan Dapan
is a Celestial Realm-stage master.

74
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,399
He excels in all kinds of martial arts.

75
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,120
To defeat him

76
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,319
won't be easy.

77
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,275
I'd like

78
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,319
to shake Mount Kunlun alone.

79
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,720
Is Celestial Realm really
capable of changing the weather?

80
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,800
It just happens
that the thunder is rumbling.

81
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,600
If he could alter the weather,

82
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,700
then there would be no draught or flood.

83
00:06:21,225 --> 00:06:22,240
I don't understand it.

84
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,879
It is what you say it is.

85
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,100
Master Jingxuan is dead.

86
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,025
Xuanyuan Jingcheng killed him.

87
00:06:29,025 --> 00:06:30,360
Nonsense.

88
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,920
Where is the nerd?

89
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,175
He's on the snowfield.

90
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,720
Impossible.

91
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:41,225
Elder Li.

92
00:06:41,225 --> 00:06:41,839
Hmm?

93
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,439
How good is Xuanyuan Dapan?

94
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,879
He lost to me when we had a sword match.

95
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,475
After that? I don't know.

96
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,600
It looks he's better than before.

97
00:06:50,975 --> 00:06:51,920
What about her dad?

98
00:06:53,025 --> 00:06:53,950
Her dad?

99
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,625
From what I'm seeing here,
he hasn't reached Celestial Realm yet.

100
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,200
He'll lose for certain, right?

101
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,100
The realm stage isn't
the only determinant.

102
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,750
Both Xuanyuan Dapan and
Wang Xianzhi are at Celestial Realm,

103
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,720
but Wang can defeat him singlehanded.

104
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,720
What about you?

105
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,450
The same. Singlehanded.

106
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,279
This

107
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,040
is the best you can do, right?

108
00:08:06,175 --> 00:08:07,199
The second one.

109
00:08:14,175 --> 00:08:15,350
The third one.

110
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,450
Move air against the sea.

111
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,950
No matter who wins the match,

112
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:47,200
you'll be a dead man for sure.

113
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,950
Please come with me,

114
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,320
Old Ancestor.

115
00:08:51,925 --> 00:08:53,279
You?

116
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:57,120
And your contrived Celestial Realm?

117
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:22,000
How come there are three tornados?

118
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,720
There will soon be a result.

119
00:09:23,725 --> 00:09:25,919
Live or die, it'll be decided soon.

120
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,679
It is him.

121
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,639
He's going to win?

122
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:36,475
Be careful, Old Ancestor.

123
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,960
He did it!

124
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,360
This one attack of yours cost your life,

125
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,679
but you still failed to hurt me.

126
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,960
You came, too.

127
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,240
Good.

128
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,519
After I end his life,

129
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,559
I'll fight you, God of Sword.

130
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:35,440
Since I couldn't kill you
with the power of Celestial Realm,

131
00:11:35,725 --> 00:11:36,840
I'll have to

132
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,720
take another step up.

133
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,244
The next stage of Celestial Realm

134
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,600
is Immortal-on-Earth.

135
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,679
Even Wang Xianzhi
hasn't achieved it yet.

136
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:51,125
How can you make it?

137
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,639
Old Ancestor,

138
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,039
have you heard of epiphyllum?

139
00:12:10,225 --> 00:12:12,080
It decays as it blooms.

140
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,625
Its magnificence lasts only an instant.

141
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,159
This is

142
00:12:41,075 --> 00:12:43,399
Immortal-on-Earth Realm.

143
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,650
Immortal-on-Earth?

144
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,375
Is it so easily achieved?

145
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,360
He's burning his own
blood and vital energy

146
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,500
to ignite his heart flame

147
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,919
and mount the apex.

148
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,279
But like he said,

149
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,799
it decays and it blooms.

150
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,050
This is

151
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,960
the end of his life.

152
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,525
It's impossible.

153
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,080
Even if you sacrifice your life,

154
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,679
it's impossible

155
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,300
for you to reach
Immortal-on-Earth Realm.

156
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:12,279
Doing good is
as difficult as mountain-climbing.

157
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,879
Still, Mount Kunlun is reachable.

158
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,440
You should really read carefully

159
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,919
the books that you deem useless.

160
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,375
If you don't comprehend
the law of the universe,

161
00:13:24,675 --> 00:13:25,950
you'll never

162
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,960
achieve this stage in this life.

163
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,150
You aren't qualified to lecture me.

164
00:13:42,975 --> 00:13:45,919
Will you leave
any last words to Mount Hui?

165
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:54,519
Even if you now are
an immortal on Earth,

166
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,350
how much longer can you live?

167
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,200
If I dodge the best I can,

168
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,279
you won't be able to kill me.

169
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,600
In the end,

170
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,850
it'll be me who watches you

171
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,000
die in regret.

172
00:14:07,075 --> 00:14:08,480
He'll just dodge?

173
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,679
That's cheeky of him.

174
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:10,960
That's called being realistic.

175
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,480
What would you do?

176
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,879
A sword-wielder never backs off.

177
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,320
Seriously?

178
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,075
He still makes use of the sky.

179
00:14:31,075 --> 00:14:32,559
If he was an immortal on Earth,

180
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:33,879
he would be able to kill him
with his own power.

181
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:35,200
He's amazing enough.

182
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,950
How much longer do you get to live?

183
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:43,550
Dad.

184
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,559
Wait, wait, wait.

185
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,000
I can turn the authority
over to Qingfeng.

186
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I swear

187
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,480
that I'll never touch her.

188
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,480
Please

189
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,799
ascend to the heavens, Old Ancestor.

190
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,075
Mount Hui

191
00:16:51,675 --> 00:16:53,559
will be yours.

192
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:57,375
Dad.

193
00:17:00,975 --> 00:17:01,925
Dad.

194
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:05,700
Dad.

195
00:18:00,175 --> 00:18:01,720
Old Ancestor has gone.

196
00:18:02,825 --> 00:18:05,160
The family needs a leader.

197
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,079
The heavy burden

198
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:08,450
shall fall onto me.

199
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,279
Disciples.

200
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,880
Seize the daughter of the rebel.

201
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,800
Wait.

202
00:18:27,725 --> 00:18:29,250
I, Xu Fengnian of North Liang,

203
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,350
would like to lead Xuanyuan

204
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,359
following God's will.

205
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,000
Carry him away.

206
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:13,750
- Yes.
- Yes.

207
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,075
Ma'am.

208
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,650
Xuanyuan Dapan is dead.

209
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,525
What about him?

210
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:38,875
How did he end up?

211
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,079
Master Jingcheng

212
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,350
fought the old villain with his life,

213
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,025
and eventually perished.

214
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,559
You came to seek refugee?

215
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,425
Master Jingcheng said,

216
00:20:02,275 --> 00:20:03,559
if he dies in the battle,

217
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:08,200
I'm to hand the sachet to you.

218
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,680
Your Highness,

219
00:20:40,325 --> 00:20:41,519
this is Mount Hui,

220
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:43,119
not North Liang.

221
00:20:43,725 --> 00:20:46,279
Xuanyuan Jingcheng
rebelled against the ancestor,

222
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:47,450
which is a heavy sin.

223
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,375
How can his daughter command Mount Hui?

224
00:20:50,975 --> 00:20:52,799
Even if we put this aside,

225
00:20:52,925 --> 00:20:54,900
all family affairs

226
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
were handled by me and Jingxuan.

227
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,559
There's too much to attend to.

228
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,119
How does she cope?

229
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,359
Even if she is given authority,

230
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,680
how many of us will obey?

231
00:21:15,325 --> 00:21:16,920
You're in high status, Your Highness.

232
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,519
I'm sure you'll handle everything well.

233
00:21:21,925 --> 00:21:26,000
But how long will you stay in Mount Hui?

234
00:21:26,825 --> 00:21:28,680
He has a point.

235
00:21:30,725 --> 00:21:32,920
If I become the householder,

236
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,200
I'd like to ally with North Liang.

237
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,519
As for my niece,

238
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,119
you can have her.

239
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,680
You've got shameless uncles.

240
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,425
Uncle Jingyi has an unruly personality.

241
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,160
Now that Xuanyuan Dapan,

242
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,519
my dad and Uncle Jingxuan are all dead,

243
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,000
no one can hold
his ambition in check now.

244
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,920
North Liang is far away
from Mount Hui.

245
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,725
I bet he'll break loose of North Liang.

246
00:22:21,725 --> 00:22:24,759
He may even stab you in the back.

247
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:26,880
Do you dare

248
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,359
to ally with someone like this?

249
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,559
How are you better than me?

250
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,720
He's asking you a question.

251
00:22:41,775 --> 00:22:42,750
Yes.

252
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,440
It's a tricky question.

253
00:22:44,575 --> 00:22:45,480
Why?

254
00:22:45,925 --> 00:22:48,550
If the girl says
she's loyal to North Liang,

255
00:22:48,675 --> 00:22:50,079
the Xuanyuan Family won't be happy.

256
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,839
If she says she's loyal to the family,

257
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,799
then Xu Fengnian has
no reason to help her.

258
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:55,650
It'll be a wrong answer
either way, right?

259
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,319
Princess, you should think about it, too.

260
00:23:01,475 --> 00:23:02,720
When the time comes,

261
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,519
what would you choose

262
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,920
between your homeland
and Xu Fengnian?

263
00:23:07,925 --> 00:23:09,200
Chess Master?

264
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,119
A voice through air.
No one else can hear it.

265
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,880
You heard it, too?

266
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,960
It took him so much effort to find you,

267
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,599
would he leave you be?

268
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,039
He's been with us along the way.

269
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,200
I swear

270
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,079
that if I'm in charge of Xuanyuan,

271
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:40,559
I shall do all I can

272
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,480
to reinvigorate our family,

273
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,325
making sure the Xuanyuan Family
never falls again.

274
00:23:53,275 --> 00:23:55,225
Everybody can brag.

275
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:57,119
What actions will you take?

276
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,039
Once I'm the householder,

277
00:23:59,175 --> 00:24:01,960
Wending Pavilion
will be open to the entire family.

278
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:03,759
Even a retainer

279
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:05,525
gets to study inside of it.

280
00:24:06,025 --> 00:24:07,625
If Qingfeng's in charge...

281
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:08,225
Perfect.

282
00:24:08,225 --> 00:24:09,400
- We can enter Wending Pavilion, too.
- Yeah, that'd be great.

283
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,875
- Right.
- We can study martial arts, too.

284
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,440
Reinvigorate the family?

285
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:22,000
I'm afraid the family
would serve under certain people.

286
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,839
Now that Xuanyuan Dapan is dead,

287
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:26,480
Mount Hui is out on a limb.

288
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,119
The alliance with North Liang

289
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:29,960
will serve as the shelter
for the Xuanyuan Family.

290
00:24:31,075 --> 00:24:32,599
But here I take a vow

291
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,839
that the Xuanyuan Family
will never take orders from others.

292
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,825
- Before the next Celestial Realm rises,
- It'd be perfect. Yeah.

293
00:24:38,825 --> 00:24:39,800
the Xuanyuan Family

294
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,075
will cooperate with North Liang
the best we can.

295
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,720
What if there's a new Celestial Realm?

296
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,440
If there's one,
we'll renegotiate the terms.

297
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:49,640
It's honest of you.

298
00:24:53,175 --> 00:24:54,880
You two can't decide the master

299
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,799
of the Xuanyuan Family by talking.

300
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,480
Eventually,

301
00:25:00,025 --> 00:25:03,160
it's decided by the will
of our clansmen.

302
00:25:03,475 --> 00:25:04,240
Everybody,

303
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,350
if our clan

304
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:09,400
is under the control
of such a young girl,

305
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:11,920
won't we be laughed at?

306
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,680
Ask yourselves.

307
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,950
Who's better suited to be the master?

308
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:21,319
Isn't it obvious?

309
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,160
Hierarchy is fundamental to a clan.

310
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,875
Good point.

311
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:33,440
Hierarchy.

312
00:25:34,925 --> 00:25:36,119
Qingfeng,

313
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,759
listen.

314
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:41,575
This is the will of our clansmen!

315
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,875
He's killed?

316
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,500
I can't believe he's killed.

317
00:26:13,225 --> 00:26:15,440
Speaking of hierarchy,

318
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:18,440
Master Jingcheng
is the eldest lineal son

319
00:26:19,475 --> 00:26:21,279
and Miss Qingfeng should be the master

320
00:26:21,575 --> 00:26:24,799
with the right reason.

321
00:26:25,025 --> 00:26:27,000
Xuanyuan Jingyi died.

322
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,079
My Lady, take over the Xuanyuan Family.

323
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,900
- My Lady, take over the Xuanyuan Family.
- My Lady, take over the Xuanyuan Family.

324
00:26:34,325 --> 00:26:37,325
- My Lady, take over the Xuanyuan Family.
- My Lady, take over the Xuanyuan Family.

325
00:26:50,825 --> 00:26:51,759
I didn't give that order.

326
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,725
Who else did that, then?

327
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,680
Your father is really something.

328
00:27:31,925 --> 00:27:32,950
The rain has stopped.

329
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,975
The situation has changed.

330
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,025
Excuse me?

331
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,319
Didn't you hear me?

332
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:57,400
Xuanyuan Jingcheng and Xuanyuan Dapan
died together.

333
00:27:58,525 --> 00:28:00,100
Xuanyuan Qingfeng

334
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,625
will take over the Xuanyuan Family.

335
00:28:04,025 --> 00:28:05,800
What do you think she'll do to you?

336
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,550
That's impossible.

337
00:28:11,525 --> 00:28:13,685
I don't care if you believe that.

338
00:28:14,825 --> 00:28:17,079
But you don't have too much time

339
00:28:18,475 --> 00:28:19,559
to make a decision.

340
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,200
Hold a decent funeral for Uncle Jingyi.

341
00:28:49,225 --> 00:28:50,480
We will, My Lady.

342
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,400
Take down Yuan Tingshan.

343
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,119
Yes.

344
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:05,839
Search for him!

345
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:07,150
- Yes.
- Yes.

346
00:29:23,225 --> 00:29:24,100
Do you believe it now?

347
00:29:25,975 --> 00:29:27,200
Why did you come and inform me of it?

348
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,325
I want to help you.

349
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,200
Why?

350
00:29:42,325 --> 00:29:43,550
Xu Fengnian

351
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:45,319
has ruined your chance.

352
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,650
Do you hate him?

353
00:29:51,075 --> 00:29:52,079
Shall we

354
00:29:54,525 --> 00:29:55,825
join hands to kill him?

355
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,440
I'm not a fool.

356
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:03,525
Come on.

357
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,559
If you want supreme martial arts,

358
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:08,480
I can give you the books.

359
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,400
If you want a bright future,

360
00:30:15,475 --> 00:30:17,319
I can give it to you, too.

361
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,000
He's gone?

362
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,720
Go search for him!

363
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,599
You have no way out, anyway.

364
00:30:31,525 --> 00:30:32,640
Leave with me.

365
00:30:33,775 --> 00:30:34,559
I have...

366
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,279
...a surprise

367
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:39,775
for you.

368
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:44,700
You may rise.

369
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,200
I'll keep my promise.

370
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,759
From this day on,

371
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,799
all clansmen of the Xuanyuan Family
have access to Wending Pavilion

372
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:55,759
to learn martial arts.

373
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:58,720
Retainers making contributions
are allowed in, too.

374
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:59,676
Great.

375
00:30:59,676 --> 00:31:00,550
This is great.

376
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,700
- We can enter Wending Pavilion.
- Yeah.

377
00:31:06,975 --> 00:31:09,599
Don't you fear that a genius will appear

378
00:31:10,175 --> 00:31:11,480
and take your place?

379
00:31:12,275 --> 00:31:14,319
It's a special solution
for this special period.

380
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,720
Now that I've made this decision,

381
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,700
I'm brave enough
to face any consequences.

382
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:21,319
You indeed behave like a master.

383
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:26,200
Who are you, sir?

384
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:28,750
My name isn't worth mentioning.

385
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,839
I made a mistake
and got my family involved.

386
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:32,839
Jingcheng saved my family.

387
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,480
I must pay him back for that.

388
00:31:45,025 --> 00:31:46,240
My father left this to me?

389
00:31:46,475 --> 00:31:47,200
Yes.

390
00:32:00,775 --> 00:32:01,700
One for me, too?

391
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,450
Your Highness, according to Jingcheng,

392
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:06,200
after Xuanyuan Dapan died,

393
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,025
if you helped Miss Qingfeng,

394
00:32:08,325 --> 00:32:10,759
I would give this to you.

395
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,200
It's foresighted of him.

396
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,519
Don't you open it?

397
00:32:19,225 --> 00:32:20,575
Your Highness, you haven't replied yet.

398
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,079
What do you want from us?

399
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,925
Many people are around.

400
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,200
Shall we have a private talk?

401
00:32:44,825 --> 00:32:46,525
Girl, you're enjoying the flowers?

402
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,150
It's sweet.

403
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,079
What?

404
00:32:52,775 --> 00:32:54,680
There's honey in the flower.

405
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,175
So, it tastes sweet.

406
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:59,079
When I was gluttonous at a young age,

407
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,200
I often ate the petals.

408
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:01,725
Other girls

409
00:33:01,725 --> 00:33:03,680
enjoy and love flowers.

410
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,680
But you eat them.

411
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,000
I live a hard life,
so I love sweet things.

412
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:13,100
It's indeed sweet.

413
00:33:34,825 --> 00:33:36,240
My father loved reading.

414
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:38,480
This is where he usually sat.

415
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,400
When he was tired,

416
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,079
he liked to look out of the window.

417
00:33:44,425 --> 00:33:45,759
Nothing special, I think.

418
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:47,650
Yeah.

419
00:33:49,275 --> 00:33:51,775
The window isn't near the river.

420
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,160
There's no scenery out there, either.

421
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:56,440
I don't know
what he was looking at every day.

422
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,960
I never understood

423
00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:01,960
what he was thinking of.

424
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,750
Fathers

425
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,880
always behave like that.

426
00:34:09,475 --> 00:34:10,920
They arrange everything,

427
00:34:10,925 --> 00:34:12,039
take all the responsibility,

428
00:34:13,325 --> 00:34:14,559
and never want to tell their children.

429
00:34:18,675 --> 00:34:20,100
You're right, I guess.

430
00:34:42,325 --> 00:34:43,320
What's the letter about?

431
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:45,360
Characters, preferences, and experiences

432
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,519
of our clansmen and retainers.

433
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:48,625
He kept this to control them, I suppose.

434
00:34:54,275 --> 00:34:55,559
I think it took him a long time.

435
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:05,200
If Xu Fengnian is too greedy,

436
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,700
don't fight against him.

437
00:35:07,275 --> 00:35:08,280
Take shelter

438
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:09,880
from Mount Longhu.

439
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,425
On Tomb Sweeping Days,

440
00:35:21,275 --> 00:35:23,075
if your mother doesn't want
to go to my tomb,

441
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,800
don't force her.

442
00:35:25,725 --> 00:35:27,475
When I can't spend my life with her,

443
00:35:28,175 --> 00:35:30,440
it's also my luck

444
00:35:31,275 --> 00:35:32,750
to set her free.

445
00:35:33,675 --> 00:35:34,975
Since you were born,

446
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:37,400
I've buried jars of wine

447
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,375
under the osmanthus tree.

448
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:41,679
One jar for each year.

449
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,599
There have been 23 jars so far.

450
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,599
Privately, I call them

451
00:35:49,425 --> 00:35:50,800
Daughter's Wine.

452
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:52,960
What do you think?

453
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,639
Don't blame me for nagging.

454
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,760
In the past,

455
00:35:59,475 --> 00:36:01,320
I only said a few words to you

456
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,760
every year.

457
00:36:04,025 --> 00:36:06,200
I've got a lot to tell you,

458
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,440
but I don't know
how to start the conversation.

459
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,039
Qingfeng,

460
00:36:15,775 --> 00:36:17,450
my biggest regret

461
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,880
is that I can't watch you get married.

462
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,280
If you get married,

463
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,159
name your son Fuyao

464
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,360
and name your daughter Yasong.

465
00:36:31,225 --> 00:36:32,039
All right?

466
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,760
No matter whether
they want to learn literature

467
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:37,714
or martial arts, let them be.

468
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,440
Life is short.

469
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,925
Living a simple life

470
00:36:42,475 --> 00:36:43,679
will be a great thing.

471
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,159
It's better than my life.

472
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,075
I never got what I wanted

473
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,400
and I made your mother hate me.

474
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,960
In case you get annoyed,

475
00:36:56,025 --> 00:36:57,425
I'll say no more.

476
00:36:58,525 --> 00:36:59,375
Wish you

477
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,825
a good life

478
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,025
and a healthy body.

479
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,280
I understand now.

480
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,480
Seen through the window,

481
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,599
there's no scenery.

482
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,175
But you look farther on,

483
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,639
you'll see the house
where my mother and I live.

484
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:52,440
What message did he leave
for you, Your Highness?

485
00:38:15,075 --> 00:38:16,600
Well, your father...

486
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,650
Mount Hui has declined.

487
00:38:22,075 --> 00:38:25,025
Your Highness, if you want our clan,

488
00:38:25,825 --> 00:38:28,250
please spare my daughter's life.

489
00:38:30,025 --> 00:38:33,320
There're treasures and secret books
in Xuanyuan Dapan's mansion.

490
00:38:34,075 --> 00:38:35,840
They're all yours.

491
00:38:37,425 --> 00:38:39,719
Xuanyuan Dapan lives
on Snowfield Guniujiang.

492
00:38:40,225 --> 00:38:41,400
You can take away whatever you want.

493
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,150
I don't want the treasures

494
00:38:44,525 --> 00:38:45,800
or secret martial arts of your family.

495
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:51,525
So, you want me?

496
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,175
Qingniao, who's out of the room,

497
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,920
is as beautiful as you.

498
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,675
She has better martial arts than you.

499
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,199
She isn't very talkative.

500
00:38:59,275 --> 00:39:01,039
But she's sensible and witty.

501
00:39:01,225 --> 00:39:02,119
She's a talented and wise girl.

502
00:39:02,525 --> 00:39:03,519
In my mansion,
I've got six or seven maids

503
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:04,960
just like her.

504
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,239
Why do I want you?

505
00:39:06,325 --> 00:39:07,480
Your Highness,

506
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,920
what exactly do you want from my family?

507
00:39:14,725 --> 00:39:15,650
Wait a minute.

508
00:39:25,775 --> 00:39:26,920
So sweet.

509
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:29,440
Have some more, then.

510
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:31,559
Sweet.

511
00:39:32,475 --> 00:39:33,300
Qingniao.

512
00:39:33,725 --> 00:39:34,480
Would you like some?

513
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,450
It's very good.

514
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:42,375
Sweet.

515
00:39:44,725 --> 00:39:45,450
What?

516
00:39:45,575 --> 00:39:46,320
Some business.

517
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,719
You're gathering honey?

518
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:53,875
It's very sweet.

519
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,239
Senior,

520
00:39:55,325 --> 00:39:57,075
you're the God of Sword, after all.

521
00:39:57,679 --> 00:39:59,100
Don't put everything in your mouth.

522
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,280
Would you like some?

523
00:40:04,225 --> 00:40:05,079
Would you like some?

524
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,199
Don't stand on ceremony. Here.

525
00:40:20,175 --> 00:40:21,039
She's my maid.

526
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,480
To be honest,

527
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,760
she's the princess of West Chu.

528
00:40:25,675 --> 00:40:26,599
Don't talk nonsense.

529
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,800
When we want a favor from her,

530
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,920
we can't hide your identity.

531
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:32,825
Princess of West Chu?

532
00:40:33,325 --> 00:40:34,200
How shall I help her?

533
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:36,079
In a couple of days,

534
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,250
she's going back to West Shu.

535
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,725
It's a long trip.

536
00:40:38,725 --> 00:40:40,200
The fastest and safest way

537
00:40:40,425 --> 00:40:41,400
is to travel by water.

538
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,625
Escorting her back home

539
00:40:48,075 --> 00:40:49,600
is the first favor I want from you.

540
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,075
I can travel alone.

541
00:40:54,025 --> 00:40:55,639
Cao Changqing has great martial arts.

542
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:56,920
But he doesn't take good care of people.

543
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:58,880
If you travel on their boat,

544
00:40:59,225 --> 00:41:00,320
you can be more relieved.

545
00:41:03,475 --> 00:41:05,225
Invincible Cao Changqing.

546
00:41:05,675 --> 00:41:07,199
You're warning me, Your Highness?

547
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,480
Clever girl.

548
00:41:09,575 --> 00:41:10,559
We don't need to be very specific.

549
00:41:11,225 --> 00:41:13,025
You awed our clan with an umbrella,

550
00:41:13,375 --> 00:41:14,719
just for this girl around you?

551
00:41:17,325 --> 00:41:18,350
It's so considerate of you.

552
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:20,775
I have no other choice.

553
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:23,559
My girl still owes me some money.

554
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:24,559
She must be safe.

555
00:41:26,675 --> 00:41:28,159
Who owes you?

556
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:30,400
Didn't I spend money
raising you for so many years?

557
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:36,425
Make a list, then.

558
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,119
I'll pay you back when I have money.

559
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,079
The interest should be included.

560
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:42,639
No matter how much you want me to pay,

561
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:43,440
I'll pay it off.

562
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:49,800
Young Master of North Liang.
Princess of West Chu.

563
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,679
Who could expect that?

564
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,000
What?

565
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,599
Nothing.

566
00:41:57,125 --> 00:41:58,480
Your Highness, when you need the boat,

567
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,475
just let me know.

568
00:42:00,075 --> 00:42:01,275
After I leave Mount Longhu,

569
00:42:01,275 --> 00:42:02,079
she should leave, too.

570
00:42:03,075 --> 00:42:04,750
You're going to Mount Longhu?

571
00:42:05,175 --> 00:42:07,440
What do you want? To get killed?

572
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,519
When someone wants to kill me,

573
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:10,900
he'll do it wherever I go.

574
00:42:12,075 --> 00:42:13,159
It's a deal, then.

575
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,280
What else do you want, Your Highness?

576
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,650
I indeed want another favor

577
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,119
from your family.

578
00:42:18,425 --> 00:42:19,280
I need your boats, too.

579
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:20,760
For escorting someone?

580
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,400
No.

581
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,840
For picking up someone.

582
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,039
Who?

583
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:25,880
Some people from different places.

584
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,760
It'll be troublesome.

585
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,760
We do business in all waterways.

586
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,000
No matter whom you want to pick up,

587
00:42:31,325 --> 00:42:32,480
just tell me.

588
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,519
I can't tell you

589
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:34,360
until the time has come to act.

590
00:42:35,025 --> 00:42:36,000
In case I give away your secret?

591
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:37,239
I've prepared my plan

592
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:38,400
for such a long time

593
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,875
and too many people are involved.

594
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:43,079
I have to keep it to myself only.

595
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,375
I won't tell anyone

596
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:47,119
