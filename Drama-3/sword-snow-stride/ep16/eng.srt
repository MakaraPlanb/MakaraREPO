1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

5
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
=Sword Snow Stride=
(Season 1)

6
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,400
=Episode 16=

7
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,480
Those whom he trusts

8
00:01:52,825 --> 00:01:54,159
followed him into the woods.

9
00:01:55,025 --> 00:01:56,525
Those whom he doesn't trust

10
00:01:56,525 --> 00:01:57,975
were left behind.

11
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,050
Including you, right?

12
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,650
It's normal that His Highness
doesn't trust me.

13
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,275
I have no loyalty to him anyway.

14
00:02:06,975 --> 00:02:08,950
Then why do you work as his guard?

15
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,925
Aren't you the same?

16
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,050
Now that we're talking about it,

17
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,050
we all stay by His Highness's side

18
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,600
to get what we want.

19
00:02:17,925 --> 00:02:18,925
I think

20
00:02:19,175 --> 00:02:20,800
we should scratch each other's back.

21
00:02:25,825 --> 00:02:26,919
The same for you as well.

22
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,400
Of course, I haven't forgotten
Mr. God of Sword.

23
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,875
You and Xu Xiao

24
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,639
are not related.

25
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,575
I guess

26
00:02:57,925 --> 00:02:59,599
you escorted His Highness to the east

27
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,450
on certain conditions, right?

28
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,575
You were once
on the top of the martial world.

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,919
Do you know a martial esoterica named

30
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,225
White Emperor Esoterica of Simplicity?

31
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,075
To be honest,

32
00:03:16,675 --> 00:03:18,475
I chose to serve under the Xu family

33
00:03:18,475 --> 00:03:20,080
for this very esoterica.

34
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,800
If you remember this,

35
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,120
I'm willing to serve under you.

36
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,075
Get lost!

37
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,725
I'll leave you be, sir.

38
00:03:52,225 --> 00:03:53,560
A beast passed by.

39
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,050
Jiang Ni.

40
00:03:55,325 --> 00:03:56,550
Is she in danger?

41
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't think so.

42
00:04:02,225 --> 00:04:04,000
Aren't you afraid that I'll tell this

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,375
to Xu Fengnian?

44
00:04:06,075 --> 00:04:07,325
Say whatever you like.

45
00:04:07,775 --> 00:04:09,425
The fact that you're after something

46
00:04:10,075 --> 00:04:11,775
only reassures them.

47
00:04:20,075 --> 00:04:22,775
If the Lin family knows
White Emperor Esoterica of Simplicity,

48
00:04:23,425 --> 00:04:24,975
I can change side to serve under you.

49
00:04:30,275 --> 00:04:31,925
My name is Lyu Qiantang.

50
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,400
Jiang Ni!

51
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,279
Are you okay?

52
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,075
Look.

53
00:05:06,325 --> 00:05:07,025
What?

54
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,360
Wow.

55
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,575
Hukui.

56
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,079
It's dead.

57
00:05:18,075 --> 00:05:19,850
I wonder what could kill it.

58
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:20,925
I saw it.

59
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:23,025
It ran over before my eyes.

60
00:05:23,075 --> 00:05:24,225
It didn't attack you?

61
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:24,959
No.

62
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:25,775
It didn't even stop,

63
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:26,700
and ran away directly.

64
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,825
What does it look like?

65
00:05:28,525 --> 00:05:30,475
It ran too fast.
I didn't see it clearly.

66
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,950
It was black-and-white

67
00:05:33,725 --> 00:05:35,800
and was carrying a person.

68
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,920
They flashed by.

69
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,920
I only saw his back.

70
00:05:38,225 --> 00:05:39,920
The person carried a sunflower.

71
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,680
Have you heard of such a person
in the martial world?

72
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,039
Not really.

73
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,120
Watch out.

74
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,319
It isn't entirely dead.

75
00:06:01,775 --> 00:06:03,200
A pregnant mother.

76
00:06:03,725 --> 00:06:04,920
And she's about to give birth.

77
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,120
What a
once-in-a-million-year opportunity.

78
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,625
When a Hukui is born,

79
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:09,575
once it opens its eyes,

80
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,560
it would take the first creature
it sees as its parent.

81
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,425
If you're the first person
that the whelp sees,

82
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,250
you can domesticate the beast.

83
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,825
The female came out first.

84
00:06:42,825 --> 00:06:44,425
The male came out after.

85
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,800
Sister and brother.

86
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,319
They'll open their eyes soon.

87
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,600
Let them see you.

88
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,175
The mother is covered with injuries.

89
00:07:07,675 --> 00:07:09,300
Yet her belly is fine.

90
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,350
It was fighting to protect her children.

91
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,725
Grandpa Wei.

92
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,650
Fortune and luck

93
00:07:18,975 --> 00:07:20,850
can be obtained,

94
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:23,500
but a mother shouldn't be taken
away from the children.

95
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,900
Guys,

96
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,425
this is your mother.

97
00:07:38,775 --> 00:07:39,959
Watch her closely.

98
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,925
And remember her with your hearts.

99
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,059
Don't ever forget her.

100
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,319
Her eyes.

101
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,925
Your mother is dead.

102
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,825
They really treat you

103
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,425
as their family.

104
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,279
I'm not your dad.

105
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,825
I'm not lying to you.

106
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,725
So unfriendly.

107
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:50,240
Don't bite her.

108
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,250
She's with me.

109
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,875
It's God's will.

110
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,350
These two Hukui

111
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,039
are predestined to be with you.

112
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,175
They need names, right?

113
00:09:06,225 --> 00:09:07,550
You're the big sister.

114
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,275
I'll call you

115
00:09:09,275 --> 00:09:10,050
Bodhisattva.

116
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:11,250
You're the little brother.

117
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,240
Your name is Vajra.

118
00:09:13,075 --> 00:09:14,320
The names are too difficult for them.

119
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,850
Yeah.

120
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:16,789
Bodhisattva.

121
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,680
Vajra.

122
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,150
Bodhisattva.

123
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,175
Bajra.

124
00:09:21,575 --> 00:09:22,350
Bodhisattva.

125
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,000
They understand you.

126
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:26,400
Vajra.

127
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,039
The elder sister is like a mother.

128
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,350
She's teaching her brother.

129
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,650
Can I touch them?

130
00:09:38,925 --> 00:09:39,679
Don't be afraid.

131
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,475
It's fine.

132
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,875
They have scales since little.

133
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,159
Their mother has two horns.

134
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,900
How come they are single-horned?

135
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,500
And they have different colors.

136
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,759
After they grow up,
they will have two horns.

137
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:02,175
And their colors will change.

138
00:10:02,425 --> 00:10:03,279
Your Highness,

139
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,550
every part of a Hukui

140
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,480
is a treasure.

141
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:07,279
Her scales can be made into

142
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,175
impenetrable armor.

143
00:10:08,325 --> 00:10:09,675
It's no worse than Fujiang Armor.

144
00:10:10,325 --> 00:10:11,425
Bury her.

145
00:10:12,225 --> 00:10:13,425
You want nothing?

146
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,975
She gave me her children.

147
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,000
And that's enough.

148
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,575
Let's go.

149
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,159
Which way?

150
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,240
We travel across Qingcheng,

151
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,159
and use the waterway.

152
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,800
We float down the river
and head straight to Qingzhou.

153
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:41,625
Get into the carriage.

154
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,650
Where did you get the baby Hukui?

155
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,800
Very ballsy of you.

156
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:03,679
What are you looking at?

157
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,475
A fine sword.

158
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,025
Xu Xiao said,

159
00:11:09,025 --> 00:11:10,200
he can't hold a sword.

160
00:11:11,025 --> 00:11:12,200
Your mother's Daliang Dragon Sparrow.

161
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,559
You recognize it?

162
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,425
Don't be nervous, little girl.

163
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,799
The sword has been used by
a woman for too long.

164
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:17,850
It doesn't suit me.

165
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,350
(The Sword Bears No Guilt
The Sword Appeases All Unfairness)

166
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,700
Hey,

167
00:11:25,025 --> 00:11:27,200
won't you say goodbye to your aunt?

168
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,475
I've said what I needed to say.

169
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,275
Travel east on the water,

170
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,875
and you'll reach Qingzhou.

171
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,950
Beware of the Lord of Jing'an
Zhao Heng.

172
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,559
In North Liang,

173
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,000
I learned what he's capable of.

174
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,200
When the late emperor passed away,

175
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,675
his eight sons fought over the heirship.

176
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,399
The Lord of Jing'an almost

177
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,440
got to sit

178
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,550
in the throne.

179
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,000
He's a scheming

180
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,039
and resourceful man.

181
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,925
He's no worse than
the emperor of Liyang.

182
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,075
Don't worry, aunt.

183
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,325
As long as North Liang still
has the 350,000-man army,

184
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:00,050
Zhao Heng wouldn't dare to kill me.

185
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,120
I hope so.

186
00:12:04,175 --> 00:12:05,879
The Lord of Jing'an.

187
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,400
I quite look forward to

188
00:12:10,175 --> 00:12:12,300
finding out what kind of person
he really is.

189
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:40,575
(Lord of Jing'an of Liyang Zhao Heng)

190
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,200
My lord.

191
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,675
(The Richest Man of Qingzhou
Wang Linquan)

192
00:12:49,675 --> 00:12:52,039
All the businesses
of the Lin family in Qingzhou

193
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,759
are under control.

194
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:58,000
The financial data

195
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,240
is all written in the books.

196
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,799
My lord,

197
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,159
(Account Book)
would you take a look?

198
00:13:02,975 --> 00:13:05,279
It's kind of a shame.

199
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,550
Such a large family

200
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,525
was ruined.

201
00:13:13,075 --> 00:13:14,679
I wonder

202
00:13:15,175 --> 00:13:18,559
how many people in the Lin family
still live in the world.

203
00:13:19,025 --> 00:13:20,799
I'm on it.

204
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,875
I promise I'll weed them all out.

205
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,320
The Lin family will never rise again.

206
00:13:27,275 --> 00:13:28,925
Benevolence.

207
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,000
Benevolence first.

208
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,320
Father.

209
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,650
You're here, too, Mr. Wang.

210
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,720
Hail, Your Highness.

211
00:13:38,825 --> 00:13:40,325
What is it?

212
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,519
(Zhao Xun, son of Jing'an)
A student of Shangyin Academy

213
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:43,600
came to us with a ruse,

214
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,825
and asks to see you.

215
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,720
You personally introduced him?

216
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,279
I'm afraid

217
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,039
what the student is going to say

218
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,919
happens to suit your will, right?

219
00:14:00,325 --> 00:14:01,300
Never mind.

220
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,240
Bring him to me.

221
00:14:04,175 --> 00:14:04,875
Yes.

222
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,075
Go.

223
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:36,320
It's flying towards North Liang?

224
00:14:37,225 --> 00:14:38,025
Yes.

225
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,550
When someone gets the tassel,

226
00:14:40,975 --> 00:14:42,720
they will head to Qingzhou.

227
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,360
At critical moments,

228
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,125
they will go to His Highness's aid.

229
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,480
What if

230
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,879
Xu Fengnian doesn't
break into Qingyang Sect?

231
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,425
If he doesn't
break into Qingyang Sect,

232
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,679
it means

233
00:14:53,825 --> 00:14:55,360
he's discreet

234
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,039
and overcautious.

235
00:14:58,225 --> 00:14:59,919
So he won't be in any major trouble

236
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:01,200
in Qingzhou.

237
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:02,960
Therefore,

238
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,440
he won't be needing the aid.

239
00:15:04,725 --> 00:15:05,720
Does Xu Xiao

240
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,559
even have to test his own son?

241
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,679
One's nature is only shown

242
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:12,120
at pivotal moments.

243
00:15:13,475 --> 00:15:15,300
His Highness didn't let me down.

244
00:15:15,575 --> 00:15:17,679
He inherited the good qualities
of Her Grace.

245
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:42,240
Old man,

246
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,159
the boat moves so fast.

247
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,919
Can you catch any fish?

248
00:15:49,275 --> 00:15:50,320
Seriously?

249
00:15:57,775 --> 00:15:58,480
Father.

250
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,919
This is the student
of Shangyin Academy.

251
00:16:07,475 --> 00:16:08,525
Zhao Kai.

252
00:16:09,425 --> 00:16:10,725
Hail, My Lord.

253
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,919
You have a ruse for me?

254
00:16:21,925 --> 00:16:23,559
I've still got business to attend to.

255
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,360
I'll excuse myself out.

256
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,519
Stay here and listen, Mr. Wang.

257
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,600
You can speak.

258
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,759
You've been governing Qingzhou

259
00:16:35,275 --> 00:16:36,679
for nearly twenty years.

260
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,080
Have you ever thought about

261
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,360
moving forward?

262
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,360
What do you mean

263
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,279
by moving forward?

264
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,519
The imperial court put you in Qingzhou

265
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,399
because they expected you
to intimidate North Liang

266
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,480
with the power of Qingzhou navy.

267
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,919
If North Liang falls,

268
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:05,319
it'll be your feat.

269
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,440
So you'll rise higher consequentially.

270
00:17:08,975 --> 00:17:11,000
North Liang has a 350,000-man army.

271
00:17:11,025 --> 00:17:12,039
Who can do anything about that?

272
00:17:13,425 --> 00:17:14,799
To destroy North Liang,

273
00:17:14,975 --> 00:17:16,000
a war isn't essential.

274
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,400
You only have to kill one person.

275
00:17:17,925 --> 00:17:18,880
Who?

276
00:17:18,925 --> 00:17:20,000
Xu Fengnian.

277
00:17:31,025 --> 00:17:33,839
Are you God of Sword
or God of Fish?

278
00:17:33,975 --> 00:17:35,759
You fish faster than a fishing net.

279
00:17:36,475 --> 00:17:38,480
I'm using the hook as a sword.

280
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,400
I'm not fishing but stabbing the fish.

281
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,720
You really are a great martial artist.

282
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,759
So-so.

283
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,240
How great are you?

284
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:46,799
Want to call me Master?

285
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,640
Why can't you hold a sword?

286
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,640
Ever since I lost to Wang Xianzhi,

287
00:17:52,725 --> 00:17:53,875
I haven't held a sword.

288
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,640
Xu Xiao thinks my heart

289
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,960
is filled with humiliation
and bellicosity

290
00:17:57,325 --> 00:17:58,880
and that once I hold a sword,

291
00:17:59,275 --> 00:18:00,266
I'll lose control

292
00:18:00,266 --> 00:18:01,350
and run amuck.

293
00:18:01,475 --> 00:18:02,480
Will you?

294
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,759
No.

295
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,119
Because what Xu Xiao doesn't know is,
the reason I never hold a sword again

296
00:18:07,525 --> 00:18:08,920
is not because of my defeat.

297
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,920
Why, then?

298
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,079
It's because one person

299
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:16,279
died before my eyes.

300
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,880
A woman?

301
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,000
Who was she?

302
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,640
Jiang Ni.

303
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,525
Hmm?

304
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,519
Do you know
why I want you to be my disciple?

305
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,279
Because I'm gifted.

306
00:18:38,725 --> 00:18:40,480
Not only that.

307
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,000
What else?

308
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,319
You being around Xu Fengnian

309
00:18:47,225 --> 00:18:48,599
is like

310
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,559
she being around me back then.

311
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,440
I want to teach you swordsmanship

312
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,720
so that you can be better
than Xu Fengnian.

313
00:18:56,075 --> 00:18:56,880
This way,

314
00:18:56,975 --> 00:18:58,839
he won't neglect you.

315
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,759
Even if someday,

316
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,319
he becomes as crazy as me,

317
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,799
you'll be able to keep him in check,

318
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,240
preventing him from making

319
00:19:07,325 --> 00:19:08,960
unmendable mistakes.

320
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,799
Are you saying the woman was…

321
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,599
She was killed by me.

322
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,119
Father,

323
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,480
what do you think?

324
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,799
A load of fallacies.

325
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,720
But he's right.

326
00:19:47,175 --> 00:19:48,720
Once we kill Xu Fengnian,

327
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,519
Xu Xiao will rebel.

328
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:51,519
Xu Xiao's rebellion

329
00:19:51,975 --> 00:19:53,700
isn't necessarily a bad thing.

330
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,319
The world would be in chaos.

331
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,000
What's good about that?

332
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,775
Chaos needs to be handled.

333
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,475
And in the chaos,

334
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,039
you'll have the opportunity

335
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,279
to fight for

336
00:20:06,425 --> 00:20:08,079
the throne.

337
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:17,359
Kick him out of my mansion.

338
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,640
Father.

339
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,550
If he enters the door again,

340
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,920
he'll be decapitated
and shown to the public.

341
00:20:37,975 --> 00:20:39,279
The ambition

342
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,000
in the kid's eyes

343
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,359
is the same as mine back in the days.

344
00:20:47,575 --> 00:20:49,920
He was raised by you,

345
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,720
so he's undoubtedly aspirational.

346
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,599
The kid that

347
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:56,240
I'm talking about is Zhao Kai.

348
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,725
Oh.

349
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:01,319
He's but a student.

350
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,680
What can he do no matter
how ambitious he is?

351
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,599
But it happens that

352
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,519
his family name is Zhao, too.

353
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,240
The Lin family

354
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,920
hasn't been weeded out yet.

355
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,839
I'm off to the business.

356
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,119
Do what you need to do, Mr. Wang.

357
00:21:34,475 --> 00:21:35,640
Xu Fengnian

358
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,680
is about to arrive in Qingzhou.

359
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,759
Are you really going to let him go?

360
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,160
Be kind.

361
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,079
Be benevolent.

362
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:03,000
Why did you agree to

363
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,880
send Xu Fengnian to Wudi City?

364
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,119
Enough.

365
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:07,799
No more questions.

366
00:22:07,825 --> 00:22:10,279
I can tell others about the deal
I made with Xu Xiao.

367
00:22:11,225 --> 00:22:12,759
Unless you're willing to be my disciple.

368
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,880
Whatever.

369
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,279
Are you ready?

370
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,319
Ready for what?

371
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,839
He's going to Wudi City.

372
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:26,039
It means you're going
to confront Wang Xianzhi again.

373
00:22:26,275 --> 00:22:27,640
Pretty good.

374
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,279
I've refrained myself for years,

375
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:30,319
and I can really use a good fight.

376
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,775
There aren't many worthy
opponents for me in the world.

377
00:22:33,775 --> 00:22:35,279
Wang Xianzhi is the worthiest one.

378
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,599
Can you win?

379
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:37,600
I'm not sure.

380
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,350
At the time,

381
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,799
I lost by a neck.

382
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,359
But now,

383
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,480
I may have gotten rusty because
I haven't touched a sword for long.

384
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,599
But that's okay.

385
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:47,119
Fights are just for fun.

386
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:48,800
Don't think about the result.

387
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,440
I hope you win.

388
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,240
Thank you, then.

389
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,519
Right now,

390
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:01,559
no one is nice to me.

391
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,680
You're quite nice.

392
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:05,200
What?

393
00:23:05,575 --> 00:23:06,319
Want

394
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:07,440
to call me Master?

395
00:23:12,675 --> 00:23:13,519
You can have it.

396
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,200
I lend it to you.

397
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,960
Give it back to me
right after the fight.

398
00:23:19,575 --> 00:23:21,359
You lend me the Divine Token?

399
00:23:22,425 --> 00:23:23,359
You recognize it?

400
00:23:26,725 --> 00:23:28,200
I recognize it right away.

401
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,839
The National Treasure of Chu State.

402
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,640
You're just going to
lend it to me like this?

403
00:23:33,075 --> 00:23:34,440
Chu State doesn't exist anymore.

404
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,240
It's just a dagger.

405
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,240
You're not going
to run amuck, are you?

406
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,359
Don't worry.

407
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:53,160
I won't.

408
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:55,559
I owe you one.

409
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,240
Think about

410
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,440
how you want me to repay you.

411
00:24:08,675 --> 00:24:10,200
How about you give him
some instructions?

412
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,880
Is this how you want me
to return the favor?

413
00:24:18,275 --> 00:24:19,759
It's your fault.

414
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,675
Ever since you

415
00:24:21,675 --> 00:24:22,839
blamed him that night,

416
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:24,400
he hasn't allowed me
to read the esoterica

417
00:24:24,775 --> 00:24:26,680
so I made a lot less money.

418
00:24:27,275 --> 00:24:29,400
Y-You give him some instructions.

419
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,880
Maybe after this stage,

420
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,640
he'll allow me to read again.

421
00:24:42,425 --> 00:24:43,839
Whatever!

422
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,275
Father has been living
a comfortable life,

423
00:24:56,275 --> 00:24:57,640
he's become conservative.

424
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,839
Killing the son of Lord of North Liang

425
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:01,559
without the imperial order

426
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,100
is concerning indeed.

427
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,000
It's a golden opportunity.

428
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:06,425
We can't miss it.

429
00:25:07,525 --> 00:25:09,279
Filial piety is the No. 1 virtue.

430
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:10,799
Your Highness,

431
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,559
you should relieve His Lordship

432
00:25:13,475 --> 00:25:14,680
from the worry.

433
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:22,275
Are you suggesting I do it?

434
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,550
I can.

435
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,175
It's just

436
00:25:32,575 --> 00:25:34,350
now that Xu Fengnian is
out of North Liang,

437
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,599
I'm afraid he's secured by
top martial artists.

438
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:37,525
Your Highness.

439
00:25:38,025 --> 00:25:39,119
Look over there.

440
00:25:46,225 --> 00:25:47,000
That guy?

441
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,680
If you would like to clear
Xu Fengnian's guards,

442
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:51,400
he's your guy.

443
00:25:59,775 --> 00:26:00,640
Kiddo.

444
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:03,880
Sir?

445
00:26:06,075 --> 00:26:06,920
Don't come over.

446
00:26:09,075 --> 00:26:09,960
Don't bite me.

447
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,799
Don't bite me.

448
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:16,119
Stop.

449
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:17,240
Don't sit there and watch.

450
00:26:17,425 --> 00:26:18,480
Vajra, Bodhisattva, come back.

451
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,559
Vajra.

452
00:26:28,575 --> 00:26:29,680
You two

453
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,799
can't bite people.

454
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,550
Senior is benevolent and kind.

455
00:26:32,575 --> 00:26:34,759
If he means to kill you,
I can't stop him.

456
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,825
You don't have to
euphemistically beg for mercy.

457
00:26:37,825 --> 00:26:38,680
I'm not that cruel

458
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,279
to harm these two little fellows.

459
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,839
I thank you on behalf of them.

460
00:26:42,975 --> 00:26:45,475
You're quite a lucky guy.

461
00:26:45,475 --> 00:26:46,950
A few years later,

462
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,759
these two little guys will be
top fighters.

463
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:51,160
I never planned to raise them
into top fighters.

464
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,799
People change.

465
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:55,039
You wanted to speak to me, Senior?

466
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,319
Practicing Dahuangting

467
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:57,559
without the martial moves

468
00:26:57,875 --> 00:26:58,839
is not going to take you anywhere.

469
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,079
Draw Xiudong out of the scabbard.

470
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,799
Are you going to instruct me?

471
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,279
Keep the blade above it.

472
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:17,680
Too high.

473
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:19,759
Good.

474
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,160
Flick the blade.

475
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,250
Try to smash the walnut.

476
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:22,825
Okay.

477
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:42,519
Smash the walnut, but don't leave
any traces on the deck.

478
00:27:42,825 --> 00:27:43,519
Again.

479
00:27:51,225 --> 00:27:53,079
You read Compendium of Swords
for nothing.

480
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:54,839
What's the balance
of swordsmanship?

481
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,480
Don't look at me like that.

482
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:58,500
I know it's a blade.

483
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,519
But the principle is the same.

484
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,759
I just started reading
Compendium of Swords,

485
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:02,920
I didn't read too much.

486
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,559
Why didn't you?

487
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,650
You said the book was ridiculous

488
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:07,759
and misleading.

489
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:08,440
Yeah.

490
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,240
Think about

491
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,839
how I broke Fujiang Armor
with a waterdrop.

492
00:28:11,975 --> 00:28:14,225
Think about how I flicked.

493
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,039
Hone your skills.

494
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:37,319
With your
capability of comprehension,

495
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,000
I doubt you can make it.

496
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,039
Only smash the walnut.

497
00:28:41,075 --> 00:28:42,575
No damage to any other stuff.

498
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:56,279
Do you know the Sword Tomb
of the Wu family?

499
00:28:57,425 --> 00:28:58,519
Of course, I do.

500
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,926
A cradle of sword masters.
A forbidden place.

501
00:29:01,425 --> 00:29:02,799
There's a genius swordsman

502
00:29:03,225 --> 00:29:05,319
from the Wu family.

503
00:29:06,475 --> 00:29:07,559
He left the Sword Tomb

504
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:08,975
at the age of twenty

505
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,875
to challenge swordsmen across the world

506
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,200
and has never suffered a defeat.

507
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,000
The person

508
00:29:14,975 --> 00:29:15,826
(Sword Champion of Sword Tomb)
is the new hope of the Wu family.

509
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:16,700
(of the Wu family Wu Liuding)
is the new hope of the Wu family.

510
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,750
Wu Liuding.

511
00:29:18,825 --> 00:29:19,880
Are you finished?

512
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,799
I need to buy some salt.

513
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:21,880
You're expecting Xu Fengnian

514
00:29:21,975 --> 00:29:23,359
here in Qingzhou, aren't you?

515
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,319
Does it have anything to do with you?

516
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,839
The Mansion of Lord of Jing'an

517
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:33,050
offers to find Xu Fengnian's
whereabouts for you.

518
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:35,279
You'll hear from us
as soon as we get any information.

519
00:29:39,325 --> 00:29:40,359
What do you want?

520
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:41,960
We only wish

521
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,759
to watch you fight.

522
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,240
Why would the Wu family
attack Xu Fengnian?

523
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,079
Xu Fengnian's mother

524
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:56,799
once left the Sword Tomb for Xu Xiao.

525
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,680
Now, the new generation

526
00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:02,150
came to settle the score.

527
00:30:28,775 --> 00:30:30,000
Still practicing?

528
00:30:30,275 --> 00:30:31,599
A reminder for you.

529
00:30:31,825 --> 00:30:33,680
If you succeed a few days later,

530
00:30:33,825 --> 00:30:35,325
stack one walnut on another,

531
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,325
and then…

532
00:30:36,325 --> 00:30:37,525
And then flick the blade,

533
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:38,875
smash the walnut,

534
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:40,039
make sure the deck is fine.

535
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:42,839
I've done it.

536
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:44,575
How is it possible?

537
00:30:44,575 --> 00:30:45,920
You started practicing from noon.

538
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,119
Don't lie to me.

539
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,640
You're quite talented.

540
00:31:03,425 --> 00:31:05,119
Then why are you sitting here?

541
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,960
I'd like to try three walnuts.

542
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:08,519
I tried several times,

543
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,200
but I never made it.

544
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,175
When I flicked the blade,

545
00:31:11,175 --> 00:31:12,225
the walnut at the bottom

546
00:31:12,225 --> 00:31:13,440
would be struck away.

547
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,799
Is two the limit?

548
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:17,359
Do you know the difference

549
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:19,039
between Sword Move and Sword Intent?

550
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,039
Blade.

551
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,279
The blade didn't move a bit.

552
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,519
How did the walnut break?

553
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,960
This is Sword Gust.

554
00:31:39,325 --> 00:31:40,359
It won't work only by watching.

555
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:41,920
Hold Chunlei below Xiudong.

556
00:31:45,025 --> 00:31:46,200
Feel carefully

557
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,300
what Sword Gust is.

558
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,559
I felt it.

559
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,850
It was a strong gust.

560
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:58,119
An inner force breaks out of the body

561
00:31:58,175 --> 00:31:59,480
through a weapon.

562
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,000
The essence of Sword Gust
is the utilization of genuine spirit.

563
00:32:02,225 --> 00:32:03,839
Based on your level of Dahuangting,

564
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:04,700
after several practices,

565
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,680
you can do it, too.

566
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,160
Sword Gust is way more powerful
than sword Move.

567
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,900
Sword Move can't do that.

568
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,480
Hold the blades in place again.

569
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,240
It felt different.

570
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,720
It felt like a force hit the blade

571
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,799
to make Chunlei break away from me.

572
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:29,039
This is Sword Move.

573
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:32,000
Touch the face of Xiudong.

574
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,230
It felt like it didn't move,

575
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,440
but actually, there are slight tremors.

576
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,799
At the second flick,

577
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,119
it seemed Xiudong didn't move,

578
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,839
but it bent

579
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:40,825
at an amazingly fast speed

580
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,400
and hit Chunlei six times.

581
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,750
The counterforce got it back to normal.

582
00:32:45,725 --> 00:32:47,160
It bent six times?

583
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,519
I didn't see anything.

584
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,279
Good Sword Move

585
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,519
is as fast as thunder
and as steady as mountain.

586
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:53,319
Boy,

587
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:54,640
you've still got much to learn.

588
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,400
Sword Move and Sword Gust.

589
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,480
Which is stronger?

590
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,119
If I break an enemy with Sword Gust,
then Sword Gust is better.

591
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:01,759
If I kill someone with Sword Move,

592
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:04,319
then Sword Move beats
every Sword Gust in the world.

593
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:05,640
I get it.

594
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,720
You're the best.

595
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,440
You're indeed clever.

596
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,000
Sword Move, Sword Gust.

597
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,279
You work on them yourself.

598
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,799
Soon, we'll arrive in Qingzhou.

599
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,039
I won't fight unless necessary.

600
00:33:15,475 --> 00:33:17,400
Whether you can dodge
all the menaces or not

601
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,759
will be up to you.

602
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,939
Thank you for your instructions, sir.

603
00:33:23,939 --> 00:33:25,240
I didn't mean to instruct you.

604
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,880
I owe someone a favor.

605
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,079
And I'm returning it
by instructing you.

606
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,200
You owe a favor to whom?

607
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:37,240
An inner force breaks out of the body

608
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,475
through a weapon.

609
00:33:52,075 --> 00:33:52,839
Sir,

610
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:54,160
I managed to perform Sword Gust.

611
00:33:54,525 --> 00:33:56,359
That's Blade Gust.

612
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:57,880
That's true.

613
00:33:58,650 --> 00:33:59,920
Your strength

614
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,920
wasn't even enough to kill a chicken.

615
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,175
Keep practicing.

616
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,839
The kid

617
00:34:07,325 --> 00:34:09,950
improves faster than I did.

618
00:34:14,575 --> 00:34:16,575
(Mansion of the Lord of North Liang)

619
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,159
General,

620
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,719
you've slept several nights

621
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:44,880
in front of the mansion.

622
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,440
Your people want to know

623
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,760
when you will be back at home.

624
00:34:50,275 --> 00:34:51,440
Godfather

625
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,400
asked me to wait for a hawk
to deliver a tassel.

626
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:56,119
I won't leave

627
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:57,039
until the hawk comes.

628
00:34:59,475 --> 00:35:00,440
What is that?

629
00:35:00,525 --> 00:35:01,440
A hawk.

630
00:35:01,775 --> 00:35:02,920
It seems like a hawk.

631
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:13,760
General.

632
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,519
I'll go check it for you.

633
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:15,480
Move aside.

634
00:35:20,625 --> 00:35:21,719
General, be careful.

635
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,920
The tassel.

636
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,550
It's the tassel!

637
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:33,679
You stay in front of the mansion.

638
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,519
Once you receive the tassel from a hawk,

639
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:39,639
you lead your cavalrymen
to Qingzhou at once.

640
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,550
General, take it easy.

641
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,639
Pass my order. We set out.

642
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:48,960
Follow me to the east
to reinforce His Highness.

643
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,239
The dispatchment of soldiers
require the tiger tally.

644
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:51,280
The heck with the tiger tally.

645
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,400
I'll execute all those who disobey me.

646
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,000
Please put on your armor, General.

647
00:35:54,575 --> 00:35:55,975
I'll put on it on the way.

648
00:35:57,475 --> 00:35:59,250
Make way. Make way.

649
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,719
Words from the river,

650
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:02,280
Xu Fengnian will arrive at
Chunshen Lake today.

651
00:36:02,575 --> 00:36:03,900
Have you let Wu Liuding know?

652
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,239
He said he's doing sword maintenance

653
00:36:05,325 --> 00:36:06,639
and won't take action until tomorrow.

654
00:36:06,925 --> 00:36:07,760
We won't wait for him.

655
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,559
Rally the navy
and set sail to Chunshen Lake.

656
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:10,559
We can't miss the opportunity.

657
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:23,039
You gave the Divine Token to Senior Li?

658
00:36:26,725 --> 00:36:28,000
It's none of your business.

659
00:36:29,975 --> 00:36:31,700
Aren't you afraid
of falling into the water?

660
00:36:32,175 --> 00:36:33,320
I get nice views here.

661
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,400
How about you try to sit here, too?

662
00:36:36,225 --> 00:36:37,679
I'm a bad swimmer.

663
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,280
I'm here with you.

664
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,320
You won't fall into the water.

665
00:37:20,575 --> 00:37:22,800
The lake is way larger than
the one in the mansion.

666
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,920
Of course.

667
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,525
800-long Chunshen Lake

668
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:29,000
is where many waterways
and rivers rendezvous.

669
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,639
It's always been a strategic location.

670
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,920
The Lord of Jing'an governs Qingzhou

671
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,639
and his navy is entrenched
in Chunshen Lake.

672
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:38,880
It's his natural defense
from North Liang.

673
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:42,079
You don't find another lake like this

674
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,639
across the entire world.

675
00:37:45,775 --> 00:37:47,130
You talk so much.

676
00:37:49,425 --> 00:37:50,360
What do you want to speak to me?

677
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,925
Your Hukui babies

678
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,875
are stealing raw meat
from the provision cabin.

679
00:37:57,325 --> 00:37:58,440
They didn't hurt anyone, right?

680
00:37:58,925 --> 00:38:00,025
No.

681
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:02,050
They are very slick.

682
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:04,440
They scare others
but never hurt anyone.

683
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,639
Leave them be, then.

684
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:12,559
There's a ship over there.

685
00:38:21,225 --> 00:38:22,950
And another ship behind us.

686
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:27,875
That's a big one.

687
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,300
Those are Qingzhou navy's
Yellow Dragon Towered Ships.

688
00:38:46,025 --> 00:38:47,280
They came to look for trouble?

689
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,559
Maybe.

690
00:38:50,425 --> 00:38:51,639
I see a ship over there.

691
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,650
It's fine.

692
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,875
That's Qingzhou navy, too.

693
00:38:57,519 --> 00:38:58,840
Do you think

694
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,079
it's a coincidence

695
00:39:01,275 --> 00:39:03,079
or an arrangement?

696
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:04,719
It must be a coincidence.

697
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,350
I heard nothing from the Mansion
of the Lord of Jing'an,

698
00:39:08,325 --> 00:39:11,239
so who in Qingzhou dare
come to pick Xu Fengnian up?

699
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:17,480
What does this ship want?

700
00:39:20,575 --> 00:39:21,719
Weird.

701
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,559
It seems that ship is here
to pick Xu Fengnian up.

702
00:39:25,075 --> 00:39:26,025
Who dare pick him up?

703
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,559
Do you know him?

704
00:39:36,025 --> 00:39:37,119
Wang Linquan?

705
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:42,400
Are we going to fight them?

706
00:39:46,225 --> 00:39:47,199
Are you

707
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,079
the son of the Lord of North Liang,
Xu Fengnian?

708
00:39:51,275 --> 00:39:52,239
Yes, I am.

709
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:55,701
Your Highness.

710
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,880
Did His Lordship ask

711
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,199
Mr. Wang to appear at this moment?

712
00:40:02,425 --> 00:40:03,840
Your Highness.

713
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,719
Turn back to the base.

714
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:18,599
We can't attack them today

715
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,880
in case that Father's plan is disrupted.

716
00:40:38,775 --> 00:40:39,725
Look so alike.

717
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,719
Who on earth are you?

718
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:45,159
I'm Wang Linquan.

719
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,925
Hail, Your Highness.

720
00:40:47,825 --> 00:40:49,159
Wang Linquan?

721
00:40:49,525 --> 00:40:51,599
You're the money-maker under
the Lord of Jing'an?

722
00:40:53,275 --> 00:40:54,719
I was ordered to

723
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,400
serve under the Lord of Jing'an.

724
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:00,440
I used to be a servant of North Liang.

725
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:03,639
It was His Lordship's order

726
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,159
that Wang Linquan went to
serve under Qingzhou.

727
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:06,960
You know him?

728
00:41:08,725 --> 00:41:11,039
I've been the secret liaison

729
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,519
between North Liang
and Wang Linquan.

730
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,960
So it was Xu Xiao who
sent you to Qingzhou?

731
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,599
Yes.

732
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,480
After decades of endeavors

733
00:41:20,825 --> 00:41:22,880
and the secret help of General-in-Chief,

734
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,320
the Lord of Jing'an
has put his trust in me.

735
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,575
The Lin family fell

736
00:41:26,925 --> 00:41:30,039
and the financial power of Qingzhou
was given to me.

737
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:33,175
The Lord of Jing'an thinks
he's the winner of the game,

738
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:34,880
but eventually,

739
00:41:35,775 --> 00:41:38,825
it is General-in-Chief
who gets the better of him.

740
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,360
Decades of the under-cover job
must have been tough for you.

741
00:41:53,725 --> 00:41:56,400
As you kneel, all of your previous
hard work goes in vain.

742
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:01,079
The day you arrive in Qingzhou

743
00:42:01,925 --> 00:42:05,920
is the day my identity as a liegeman
of North Liang gets reinstated.

744
00:42:08,725 --> 00:42:09,725
I've been

745
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,320
