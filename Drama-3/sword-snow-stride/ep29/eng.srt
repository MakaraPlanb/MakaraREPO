1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

5
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
=Sword Snow Stride=
(Season 1)

6
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,400
=Episode 29=

7
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,820
A cavalry seems to be approaching.

8
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,000
It should just be passing by.

9
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,150
Even if they want to kill me,
they won't do it on an official road.

10
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,820
(Xuanyuan Qingfeng,
Only Daughter of the Xuanyuan Family)

11
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,180
What's wrong?

12
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,870
Do you know the woman?

13
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,220
Xuanyuan Qingfeng.

14
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,180
The Xuanyuan Family
of Hill Guniu of Mount Hui.

15
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:25,870
Yes.

16
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,140
The Xuanyuan Family of Jiangdong.

17
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,180
Do you know it, too?

18
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,550
Of course I do.

19
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,900
The family

20
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,300
has a foundation of hundreds of years.

21
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,850
It controls the water transport

22
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,020
of the world.

23
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,540
There is an old monster in the family,

24
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,460
Xuanyuan Dapan.

25
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,980
He's reached Celestial Realm.

26
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,780
Diamond Realm, Void Realm,
Celestial Realm.

27
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,220
Is he of the same realm
with Wang Xianzhi?

28
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,470
Xuanyuan Qingfeng?

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,100
Isn't she the only daughter

30
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,420
of Xuanyuan Jingcheng,
the eldest grandson of the family?

31
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,550
Are you afraid of her?

32
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,870
Afraid?

33
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,300
Of course I'm not.

34
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,740
Then why do you hide?

35
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,950
During my three years of tour,

36
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,900
Old Huang and I

37
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,550
had met her.

38
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,320
What did you do to her?

39
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,270
Wasn't Wen Hua with us at that time?

40
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,720
He thought Xuanyuan Qingfeng
was good-looking.

41
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,400
So he complimented her a little.

42
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,820
What did he say?

43
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,940
He said something

44
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,470
about her hips

45
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,670
being suitable for childbirth.

46
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,500
Wen Hua said that.

47
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,700
Xuanyuan Qingfeng was unreasonable.

48
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,940
She raced after us.

49
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,500
It was just a misunderstanding.

50
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,350
Swordsmen wandering in
the martial world

51
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,500
should be generous.

52
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,200
She was generous enough
to not kill you.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,980
Grandpa Wei.

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,670
Follow the cavalry at a distance.

55
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,550
Yes.

56
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,870
What's that look?

57
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,500
Didn't you try to avoid her?

58
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,550
Why do you follow her?

59
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,150
Her family is useful to us.

60
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,400
The Xuanyuan Family controls
the waterways of the world.

61
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,550
Mount Hui and Mount Longhu
are separated by a river.

62
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,660
The family alone

63
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,650
can stand up to the four
Longhu Arch-Taoists as an equal.

64
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,650
What a high status!

65
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,550
So Xu Xiao wants you

66
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,300
to marry her?

67
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,320
Absolutely not.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,170
To be honest,

69
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,660
we're supposed to

70
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,220
visit the Xuanyuan Family on the trip.

71
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,200
It was a surprise that

72
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,170
we met Xuanyuan Qingfeng.

73
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,850
She seems to
head towards Mount Hui, too.

74
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,850
Her family controls all the waterways.

75
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,100
Why does she ride a horse
instead of taking a boat?

76
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,660
Why don't you ask her?

77
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,520
Xuanyuan Qingfeng?

78
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,860
It's said
she and her father are at odds.

79
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,780
If we follow her,

80
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,670
we may find some useful things.

81
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,380
Forget it.

82
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,000
Let's kill Xu Fengnian first.

83
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,180
We're just passing by.

84
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,500
We mean no harm.

85
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,350
You're quite combative.

86
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,720
Nice armor.

87
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,580
Nice move.

88
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:16,900
Don't you attack us again?

89
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,180
If I may ask,

90
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,100
why did you attack us?

91
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,220
Do we know you?

92
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,450
I was just awake.

93
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:25,940
I was grumpy.

94
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,500
What about now?

95
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,070
I can't kill you.

96
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,700
I'd better sleep.

97
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:35,720
May I

98
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:36,700
know your name?

99
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,270
Taking the shortcut,

100
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,460
we'll return early.

101
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,250
Take the shortcut.

102
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,000
Make way.

103
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,020
Go.

104
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,100
Yuan Tingshan?

105
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,260
(Yuan Tingshan, Retainer of the Xuanyuan Family)
Miss Qingfeng, are you going to the mountain?

106
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,620
What if I am?

107
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,400
Don't go.

108
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,250
You're just a retainer of my family.

109
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,750
How dare you stop me?

110
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,370
I'm just following orders.

111
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,350
Whose orders?

112
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,370
Old Ancestor issued a transfer order
from Snowfield Guniujiang,

113
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,200
commanding me to return.

114
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,800
Who dares to disobey his order?

115
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,860
Who do you think?

116
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,300
Did my father send you?

117
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,920
What if I must go back?

118
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,340
You can't go back.

119
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,150
They're all combative.

120
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,700
Whose team is this?

121
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,340
Who are you?

122
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,780
Our young master came to save you.

123
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,340
Could you tell me who you are?

124
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,650
She is talking to you.

125
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,250
Could I not show my face?

126
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,800
In that case, why did you save her?

127
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,950
Think about it.

128
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,370
At that time,
I just gave her a little compliment.

129
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,820
Wen Hua did that.

130
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,000
She raced after us for a few blocks.

131
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,470
Today I saved her life.

132
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,150
We can call it even.

133
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,520
I appreciate your help.

134
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,020
Please let me say thank you
to your face.

135
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,600
It's you!

136
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,540
Stop there!

137
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,620
Old Huang.

138
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,540
Something's wrong!

139
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,060
Wen Hua.

140
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,340
Leave immediately!

141
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,970
Miss, let me explain.

142
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,950
Nice hips. Suitable for childbirth.

143
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,950
Those are all compliments.

144
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,460
Stop looking at me!

145
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,500
Not just hips.

146
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,580
You have nice waist, too.

147
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,500
Willow, water snake,

148
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,180
wasp,

149
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,380
it's as slender and soft as them.

150
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,020
Good figure. Great shape.

151
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,200
I'll kill you, rascal!

152
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,570
How are you, Miss Xuanyuan?

153
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,300
Wait.

154
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,300
You're mistaken.

155
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,000
How could I be alone?

156
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,340
Old Huang was with me,

157
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,270
and Wen Hua.

158
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,400
Wen Hua said all those words.

159
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,340
I gave him a thumbs up at most,

160
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,350
and echoed a little.

161
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,780
He was the ringleader.

162
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,380
You...

163
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,170
Miss,

164
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,580
I made friends carelessly.

165
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,570
We were both victims.

166
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,050
How dare you show up again?

167
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,400
We have a bond, right?

168
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,300
See you next time.

169
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,580
Shu Xiu.

170
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,020
Grandpa Wei.

171
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,260
Rest assured.

172
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,270
He can't escape.

173
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,650
Who are you exactly?

174
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,670
It was so close.

175
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,420
You have no compassion for womanhood.

176
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,090
I care about you in vain.

177
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,120
Why don't you

178
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,900
let me care about you?

179
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,300
That's sweet.

180
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,350
Did he run again?

181
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,970
Dare he take liberties with me?

182
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:22,660
He's right ahead.

183
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:23,570
Go.

184
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,220
Are you Xu Fengnian from North Liang?

185
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,000
Everyone hates Xu Fengnian.

186
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,340
Why do I want to pretend to be him?

187
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,250
Who was the man that stopped you?

188
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,540
None of your business.

189
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,300
It seems that someone doesn't
want you to go back.

190
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,420
Shall we travel together?

191
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,700
It's a dangerous journey.

192
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,270
Are you Xu Xiao's son?

193
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,470
Have you

194
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,400
just figured it out?

195
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,980
So, you do

196
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,870
look like him.

197
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,380
What did you say?

198
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,020
Are you going to Mount Hui, too?

199
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:05,920
I'm going to Mount Longhu.

200
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,820
On the opposite side of the river.

201
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,500
All right.

202
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,570
Let's go part of the way together.

203
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,780
Where is he?

204
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,180
Did he cross the river?

205
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,520
Be careful!

206
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,620
Thanks, Senior.

207
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,900
Is it some swordplay or hidden weapon?

208
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,420
Handle of the Big Dipper,
Peach Wood Sword Array.

209
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,250
Why did you use a jade sword, then?

210
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,820
Because it looks noble.

211
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,350
Take the assassin to His Highness.

212
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,120
Yes.

213
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,700
No way.

214
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,540
I gave him a push with all my strength.

215
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,620
Even if he didn't die,

216
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,420
he couldn't escape without a sound.

217
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,060
Drop the act.

218
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,340
You are conscious.

219
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,980
If I want to kill you,

220
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,180
I wouldn't have saved you.

221
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,720
Why did you save me?

222
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,870
The one you gave a sneak attack

223
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,370
is Xu Fengnian of North Liang.

224
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,550
If there is a chance,

225
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,660
shall we do it again together?

226
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,620
What if I don't join hands with you?

227
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,820
I don't feel like forcing others.

228
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,170
But think it clearly.

229
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,180
You attacked him.

230
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,720
Do you think
North Liang will let you go?

231
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,020
Will the Xuanyuan Family
make an enemy of Xu Xiao

232
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,820
just for a retainer?

233
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,660
When do you take action?

234
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,250
Let's talk about it next time.

235
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,320
I hope you can live until then.

236
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,020
Won't you wait for your men?

237
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,900
They'll catch up.

238
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,720
You're in such a hurry
going back to Mount Hui.

239
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,020
Do you have anything important?

240
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,140
Sort of.

241
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,570
Who was the man that stopped you?

242
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,540
Yuan Tingshan.

243
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,770
One of our retainers.

244
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,980
Dare a retainer stop his master?

245
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,150
He probably followed my father's order.

246
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,620
What else do you want to know?

247
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,100
Will it be inconvenient for you

248
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,670
to tell me about
the important matters of your family?

249
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:40,540
Yes.

250
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,620
Just ignore me.

251
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,370
Do you try to meddle with our affairs?

252
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,340
Have some water?

253
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:53,540
No.

254
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,320
Last time I was so angry with you

255
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,220
that I didn't see your face clearly.

256
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,020
There is nothing to see.

257
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,220
Your face will

258
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,500
please my mother.

259
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,340
I...

260
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,170
I'll take a break.

261
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,500
Don't you think she is crazy?

262
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:24,750
Xu Fengnian,

263
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,000
tell me the truth.

264
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,170
Have you

265
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,620
met her mother?

266
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,700
Definitely not.

267
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,220
Let's get to the point.

268
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:35,500
Senior.

269
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,020
Yeah?

270
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,870
Do you know the Old Ancestor
of the Xuanyuan Family?

271
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:38,870
Yeah.

272
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,650
Once at Snowfield Guniujiang
of Mount Hui,

273
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,980
Xuanyuan Dapan

274
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,580
had a fight with me.

275
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,540
Is he still alive?

276
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:46,980
Who won?

277
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,550
I only lost to Wang Xianzhi.

278
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,020
What realm did you say
Xuanyuan Dapan had achieved?

279
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,940
Celestial Realm.

280
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,460
How could he be the same as me?

281
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,150
Does it mean he is good?

282
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,460
It doesn't mean anything.

283
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,620
What matters is fighting capacity.

284
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,220
Kid,

285
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,350
do you have designs on Mount Hui?

286
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,670
The Xuanyuan Family
controls the world's waterways.

287
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,300
It's very useful.

288
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,750
How do you subdue it?

289
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,020
Why don't you

290
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,570
marry the girl outside?

291
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,620
I will never sell myself.

292
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,750
What's going on

293
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:18,900
with her and her father?

294
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,060
They're said to
have a very bad relationship.

295
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,620
So she's away from home
all year round.

296
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,650
Why is their relationship so bad?

297
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,220
Her father is the eldest grandson
of their family.

298
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,620
By rights,

299
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,660
he should be in charge of
the family business.

300
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,700
But all members of the family

301
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,620
don't take him seriously.

302
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,450
Why?

303
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:47,320
(Cangwu Library,
Library of Xuanyuan Family)

304
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,460
He likes reading

305
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:49,850
rather than practicing martial arts.

306
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,570
What's wrong with reading?

307
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,020
After all, he is in a
martial arts family.

308
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,620
He can't run family business, indeed.

309
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,140
Except for not practicing martial arts,

310
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,750
he is said to be weak

311
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:01,940
and can't do anything great.

312
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,020
He is a loser.

313
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,170
Isn't he the same as you?

314
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,600
What do you mean?

315
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,380
You had a reputation

316
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,580
as bad as him, didn't you?

317
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,300
I...

318
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,420
You're right.

319
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,400
I might have a
worse reputation than he does.

320
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,270
You're grim

321
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,100
and hard to guess.

322
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,780
Maybe it's the same

323
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,950
with that guy.

324
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,620
If so,

325
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,540
he's even harder to guess.

326
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,380
The key points are,

327
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,870
why does Xuanyuan Qingfeng
return to Mount Hui

328
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,300
and why does her father stop her?

329
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:37,260
We can see through the whole game
if we figure it out.

330
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:41,170
I think ever since
you met Cao Changqing,

331
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,020
you've become much smarter.

332
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,750
Sharp.

333
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,820
You're a real queen.

334
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:48,800
No.

335
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,620
I'm always smart.

336
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,120
(Xuanyuan Jingcheng,
Eldest Son of the Xuanyuan Family)

337
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,820
You've been reading every day.

338
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:38,820
What have you read about?

339
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,340
The spirit of people,

340
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,220
the mediocre life,

341
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,600
the rights and wrongs,

342
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,220
and

343
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,380
the formless universal way.

344
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,170
That's much.

345
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,020
(Xuanyuan Jingxuan,
Third Son of the Xuanyuan Family)

346
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:55,980
Does it do any good to you?

347
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,500
Sure.

348
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,300
I won't be distracted.

349
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,350
You won't be distracted.

350
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,020
I heard one thing just now.

351
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,150
The retainer who uses a blade,

352
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,700
what's his name?

353
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,380
Yuan Tingshan.

354
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,020
Yes.

355
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,940
Yuan Tingshan.

356
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,940
I heard he went down the mountain.

357
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,100
Before he went,

358
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,060
he seemed to have seen you.

359
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,350
Yes, he did.

360
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:39,780
Why?

361
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,820
Do you want to stop Qingfeng
from coming back?

362
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:43,550
Jingcheng,

363
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:46,020
Old Ancestor picked your daughter
as his successor

364
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,500
to inherit our family martial arts

365
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,860
at Wending Pavilion of Snowfield.

366
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,580
What good fortune she has.

367
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,350
You sent someone to stop her.

368
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:56,220
Are you out of your mind?

369
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,260
As her father,

370
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,100
I have to do something for her.

371
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,820
There are many ways back home.

372
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,220
How could Yuan Tingshan alone

373
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,820
stop her?

374
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,340
Will he just happen to run into her?

375
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,860
Enough of jokes.

376
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,420
I won't disturb you any longer.

377
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,700
I'm going to visit my sister-in-law.

378
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,120
By the way, she raises good fish.

379
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,340
Have you seen it yet?

380
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,000
I'm sorry.

381
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,620
I forgot that,

382
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,140
of all the people on the mountain,

383
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,420
only you are not allowed to

384
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,100
step into your wife's residence.

385
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:37,970
Reading is useful.

386
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,620
It keeps you from being distracted.

387
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,500
So go on reading.

388
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,670
Can't your young master
eat on his own?

389
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:43,950
They're back.

390
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,100
Your Highness, we didn't catch him.

391
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:49,900
The guy

392
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,770
is crafty.

393
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:51,970
It doesn't matter.

394
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,870
Down the river is Mount Hui.

395
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,620
He doesn't have any chance
to stop her.

396
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,420
What do you say?

397
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,660
I'll have a walk.

398
00:25:58,770 --> 00:25:59,520
Enjoy yourself.

399
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,850
Kid.

400
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,400
Hey.

401
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,800
Aren't you bored?

402
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:38,900
Come out for a walk.

403
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,920
Are you insane?

404
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,320
Outwardly,

405
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,450
I was taken away by Uncle Chess Master.

406
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,740
What do you want?

407
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,120
It's kind of fun

408
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,420
to be here alone.

409
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,940
But how do you relieve yourself?

410
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:00,940
None of your business.

411
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,050
Stop messing around.

412
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,750
Listen to me first.

413
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,450
Yes.

414
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,580
Xuanyuan Qingfeng isn't wandering.

415
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,460
There is someone skulking
in the direction she's going to.

416
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,670
How do you know?

417
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,920
It's hard to fool me
from such a distance.

418
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,170
It's nothing that she wants to
meet someone secretly.

419
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,450
After all, I have a bad reputation.

420
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,500
The man she's about to see
is interesting.

421
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,600
Do you know who she sees?

422
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:36,500
Are you hurt?

423
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,020
I was attacked by three people

424
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,220
and got a blow.

425
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,820
How badly it is?

426
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,180
I may die.

427
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,020
Really?

428
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,420
It won't stop me
from going back, though.

429
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,650
What order did my father give you?

430
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,820
Don't hurt you.

431
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,820
Don't let you go back.

432
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,020
Then why Old Ancestor let me go back?

433
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,600
You were chosen to
enter Wending Pavilion

434
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,070
and be taught by Old Ancestor himself.

435
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,570
It's terrific.

436
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,900
My uncle didn't stop me.

437
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,540
Why doesn't my father want me to
attain the highest level in one step?

438
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,450
Your father was prepared.

439
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,580
Those around you were all his informers.

440
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,450
I know.

441
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,140
Taking the shortcut, we'll return early.

442
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:26,800
Take the shortcut.

443
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,260
I took them out at one time.

444
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:33,700
It was lucky.

445
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,100
What was annoying was a lord's heir
coming out of nowhere.

446
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,140
Why did you attack Xu Fengnian?

447
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,370
I couldn't help it.

448
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,860
What do you mean?

449
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,520
I can't help but want to see

450
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,490
what the superior lord's heir

451
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,980
looks like when he dies.

452
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,620
Yuan Tingshan,

453
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,900
don't go crazy.

454
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,050
Does my father have any reason

455
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,750
to stop me from going back?

456
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,820
He didn't say.

457
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,100
Forget it.

458
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,000
The general situation has settled.

459
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,720
Go back to recuperate.

460
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,700
I'll give you a chance in the future

461
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,340
to learn our unique martial arts.

462
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,250
Good.

463
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,050
Take a shortcut.

464
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,120
Don't let anyone see you.

465
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,270
Go.

466
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,340
I'll wait for you at Mount Hui.

467
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,120
What are you doing?

468
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,820
Why are you here?

469
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,820
It's time to go.

470
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,000
OK.

471
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,740
There comes the news that

472
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:16,150
my niece comes to the river.

473
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,630
You've been apart for a long time.

474
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:24,970
You should go with me to pick her up.

475
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:30,600
Someone.

476
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:31,860
Help him to go down the mountain.

477
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,500
Don't bother.

478
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,720
I can walk by myself.

479
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,770
Please.

480
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,800
How long has it been
since you came down last time?

481
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,140
Can you stand well?

482
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,470
Do you need someone to hold you?

483
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,470
Are there people from Mount Longhu?

484
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,380
Fishermen.

485
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,100
It's near Mount Longhu.

486
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,900
Everyone wears a Taoist robe.

487
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,300
They have the strength of character.

488
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,780
What?

489
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,700
They look like fools.

490
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,200
The Xuanyuan Family has stood
for a hundred years

491
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:02,420
by courtesy and righteousness.

492
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:03,750
Courtesy?

493
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,550
Righteousness?

494
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:07,550
Don't we need honor and shame?

495
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:08,780
Jingcheng,

496
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:11,120
do you read to get stupid?

497
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,260
Our family has won dignity

498
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,990
by hard fist

499
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,780
and strong muscle.

500
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:23,800
Look,

501
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,870
they're coming.

502
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,500
Is that your boat?

503
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,620
Qingfeng, you finally come back.

504
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:39,420
I come down

505
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,700
to pick you up with your father.

506
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,100
It's been years.

507
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,900
It's time to come back.

508
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,220
Old Ancestor wants to take Qingfeng
as his disciple.

509
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,860
Who can stop him?

510
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,970
Is the one with the biggest voice

511
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,900
your third uncle, Xuanyuan Jingxuan?

512
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,300
I heard that over the years,

513
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,340
he has been in charge
of your family business.

514
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,450
If nothing else,

515
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,460
he's got quite a good voice.

516
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,980
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

517
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,620
See you.

518
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,580
Already?

519
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:08,520
Mr. Xu,

520
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:10,550
we won't tread in muddy water

521
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,800
or attach ourselves to North Liang.

522
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,920
Let's say goodbye.

523
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,860
Huangman'er.

524
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,170
What is he looking at?

525
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:15,340
Jingcheng,

526
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,860
the guy who sent your daughter back,

527
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,660
do you know him?

528
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,470
I've never seen him.

529
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:24,900
It must be another swordsman

530
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,400
who tries to play up to us.

531
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,300
Qingfeng.

532
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,020
Huangman'er.

533
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,000
Huangman'er.

534
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,700
Fengnian.

535
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,980
Fengnian!

536
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,060
Fengnian!

537
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,420
They're brothers.

538
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,450
What a coincidence.

539
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,860
He is really Young Master Longxiang.

540
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,170
Isn't he afraid of water?

541
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,270
Fengnian!

542
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:22,820
Senior,

543
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,270
give me a ride.

544
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:52,420
I didn't expect my Snakes in Sleeves

545
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,620
would become his mount.

546
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,100
Charge him.

547
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:55,870
Yeah?

548
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,950
He must pay
for renting cattle and horses.

549
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,300
Don't let him take advantage of you.

550
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,850
Little girl.

551
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:03,860
Fengnian.

552
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:05,720
Fengnian.

553
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,070
Aren't you afraid of water?

554
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,850
Not anymore.

555
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,720
On the mountain,

556
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,450
some hawthorns are already ripe.

557
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:17,200
Since then,

558
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,670
the kid has been waiting for you
by the river.

559
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,700
After some time,

560
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,950
he isn't afraid of water any more.

561
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,500
Awesome.

562
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,350
Fengnian,

563
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:27,020
fish.

564
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,950
A guest must do as his host does.

565
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:29,770
Let's have some vegetarian food.

566
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,100
Don't embarrass your master.

567
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,200
Don't worry.

568
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,550
It won't embarrass him.

569
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,670
He cooks fish soup.

570
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,900
Fengnian, let's have fish.

571
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:40,350
We can't have vegetarian food every day.

572
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,720
Don't mention fish to other people.

573
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,450
Don't worry.

574
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:45,350
Nobody will mention it.

575
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,500
Put the fish down.

576
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,070
Yes.

577
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,450
Zhao Xituan?

578
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:03,400
One of the four Longhu Arch-Taoists?

579
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,810
I heard Zhao Xituan

580
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,570
took Xu Xiao's son as a disciple.

581
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,200
Xu Fengnian.

582
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:14,970
Hey,

583
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,500
should we wait for them?

584
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:18,300
Don't bother.

585
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,300
They'll catch up with us.

586
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,550
OK.

587
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,720
How did your daughter

588
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,600
know the son of Lord of North Liang?

589
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,660
I have no idea.

590
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,700
Let's go.

591
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:02,900
Go back.

592
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,900
You've been away from home for years.

593
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,350
Now you come back.

594
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:10,700
I feel relieved.

595
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,570
Was the one with you

596
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,520
Xu Fengnian of North Liang?

597
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,470
Yes.

598
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,780
Is he an old acquaintance of yours?

599
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:19,980
We've met once.

600
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:20,870
I don't know much about him.

601
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:22,420
Really?

602
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,370
Then why did he send you back?

603
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,140
We just went the same way.

604
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,850
(Mount Hui)
Same way?

605
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,800
(Mount Hui)
Qingfeng,

606
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,120
our family has been lasted

607
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,370
for hundreds of years.

608
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,460
We can't let others

609
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:35,800
control our lifeline.

610
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,980
Bright ideas.

611
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:41,950
Uncle.

612
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,800
(Xuanyuan Jingyi)
Qingfeng.

613
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,020
(Second Son of the Xuanyuan Family)
You surely have the honor.

614
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:47,540
Your second uncle
usually doesn't show up.

615
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,060
Tomorrow, Old Ancestor
will call you into Wending Pavilion.

616
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,250
Uncle,

617
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,300
I already knew.

618
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,580
You should go tomorrow.

619
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,320
Yes.

620
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,980
(Mount Hui)
Your second uncle devotes himself to martial arts.

621
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,300
(Mount Hui)
On the mountain,

622
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,300
except for Old Ancestor,

623
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,420
he takes no notice of anybody.

624
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,180
Qingfeng,

625
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,140
you'll be Old Ancestor's
direct disciple.

626
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,460
Our family

627
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,540
may be handed over to you.

628
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,340
Uncle,

629
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,220
you're the real pillar of our family.

630
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:22,800
You haven't seen each other for years.

631
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,750
Have a good talk.

632
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:35,400
I'm going to see my mother.

633
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,250
Qingfeng.

634
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,770
What can I do for you?

635
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,920
What's your relationship
with Xu Fengnian?

636
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:48,700
That's all you want to ask?

637
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,020
If you turn to him,

638
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:54,870
are you sure he will support you?

639
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,800
Maneuver among various groupings.

640
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,800
Did you read about it from some book?

641
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,270
You want to trade me
for the support of North Liang,

642
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,260
so that you can get the chance

643
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,200
to take back
the power of ruling the family?

644
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:17,170
(Mount Hui)

645
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,750
(Mount Longhu Xiaoyao Temple)

646
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,600
(Cultivate for Eternity)

647
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,920
(Xiaoyao Pavilion
Clear Sky and Fresh Air)

648
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:13,770
Mount Longhu Sect is number one
in the world.

649
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,500
Why are you so poor?

650
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:19,740
Arch-Taoists' Office is on the mountain.

651
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,450
Worshipers all go over there.

652
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:24,300
We don't have the good fortune.

653
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,220
Why don't you live on the mountain?

654
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,150
It's tiring to live with so many people.

655
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,220
Besides, the kid

656
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:31,900
isn't suitable to live

657
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,570
at a disturbing place.

658
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:36,420
Fengzi Battalion is stationed
outside the temple.

659
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:37,970
We are at your disposal.

660
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,370
Born to be Diamond Realm.

661
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:42,800
He's the only one in the world.

662
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,920
Your little brother

663
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,150
will be invincible
by achieving Void Realm.

664
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,400
Don't try to achieve Celestial Realm.

665
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,100
It requires unity of heaven and man.

666
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,720
I don't think he can endure it.

667
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,450
My disciple is practicing

668
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:55,050
Big Dream of Spring and Autumn.

669
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:57,950
He can survive the calamity
of heaven and earth by the heart arts.

670
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,750
Yeah.

671
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:01,020
You care about your disciple very much.

672
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:04,020
The direct disciple is more important
than my own life.

673
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:04,920
God of Sword.

674
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,150
Long time no see.

675
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,440
Do you still remember me?

676
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,570
Not really.

677
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:09,950
It's me.

678
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,450
Zhao Xituan of Mount Longhu.

679
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,620
Is the fish ready?

680
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,250
Almost.

681
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,950
Please be patient for a while.

682
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:17,740
Yeah.

683
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,570
How could he not remember me?

684
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,100
Don't wink at him again.

685
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,050
Jiang Ni came in through the backyard.

686
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:39,250
How could I not know there was
one more person in the carriage?

687
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,020
Who else knows?

688
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,020
Don't tell anyone.

689
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,200
Of course.

690
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:45,740
Jiang Ni?

691
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,360
Yeah.

692
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,340
How are you?

693
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:50,550
Oh, my!

694
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:52,370
Wait for me.

695
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,940
