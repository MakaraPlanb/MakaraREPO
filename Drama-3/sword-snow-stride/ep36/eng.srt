00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

7
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:02,350
Stop!

8
00:02:09,675 --> 00:02:11,820
My friend left something up there.

9
00:02:11,975 --> 00:02:13,180
I'll only take that thing

10
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,425
and won't touch anything else.

11
00:02:22,925 --> 00:02:24,780
Do we have to fight you?

12
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,340
We're going to have a fight.

13
00:02:32,575 --> 00:02:33,400
What's your plan?

14
00:02:34,975 --> 00:02:36,625
I'll fight with you.

15
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,025
Good.

16
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,140
What a good brother.

17
00:02:42,175 --> 00:02:44,460
You want to reap the spoils?

18
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,220
What did you say?

19
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,075
I said I agreed with you.

20
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,220
Since you decide to fight with me,

21
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,650
I must help you out.

22
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,300
Brother!

23
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,475
What are you doing, Brother?

24
00:02:58,475 --> 00:03:00,340
I'm just a child.

25
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,460
Get ready to fight my brother.

26
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,950
I'm just a child.

27
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,500
Brother, you're highly skilled.

28
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,750
Were you waiting for this moment?

29
00:03:47,175 --> 00:03:49,700
I was waiting for you
to crush our opponents.

30
00:03:56,025 --> 00:03:57,940
In fact, I don't work for Xu Fengnian.

31
00:03:58,025 --> 00:03:59,065
He told the truth.

32
00:03:59,065 --> 00:04:00,460
Please go easy on him.

33
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,300
Hey, Brother.

34
00:04:07,525 --> 00:04:09,675
Where did the boy come from?

35
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,860
After all, Xu is the son of
Lord of North Liang.

36
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,740
He's probably

37
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,780
a secret guard of his.

38
00:04:28,575 --> 00:04:30,980
The secret was kept well, then.

39
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,725
It's never been exposed until now.

40
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,700
What an adept!

41
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,100
He must be Xu Fengnian's master card.

42
00:04:47,325 --> 00:04:49,420
We've checked out

43
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,780
all the people around him

44
00:04:51,575 --> 00:04:53,625
except for the boy.

45
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,260
We should spare no effort

46
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,225
to kill him first.

47
00:04:58,825 --> 00:05:00,380
Shouldn't we kill Xu Fengnian first?

48
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,050
It's best if we can do that.

49
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,100
But look at him.

50
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,225
Facing six martial slaves,

51
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,340
he still takes the lead.

52
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:10,700
He's extremely loyal and brave.

53
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,340
If we kill Xu Fengnian first,

54
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,075
he'll surely step forward.

55
00:05:17,425 --> 00:05:18,550
Let's be patient.

56
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,850
Sounds fair.

57
00:05:34,975 --> 00:05:35,900
Stop!

58
00:06:30,275 --> 00:06:31,100
Your Highness,

59
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,460
I think the martial slaves

60
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,050
haven't tried their best to stop us.

61
00:06:34,575 --> 00:06:35,625
We've come this far.

62
00:06:36,025 --> 00:06:37,060
There's no need to turn round.

63
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:52,875
(Liaojia Fishing Shop)

64
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,300
Here is a chance.

65
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,775
(Liaojia Fishing Shop)

66
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,500
Go.

67
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,750
There are 12 martial slaves in total.

68
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,100
Yes.

69
00:09:29,575 --> 00:09:30,800
They're all here.

70
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,380
You're here, too.

71
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,500
Your Highness, how are you?

72
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,550
I'm your brother-in-law.

73
00:10:04,725 --> 00:10:05,775
Hello, again.

74
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,725
We are family.

75
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,300
Let me help you.

76
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,175
Are you suspicious of me?

77
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:21,540
I know Fujiang Armor.

78
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,860
What if I say
it has nothing to do with me?

79
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,940
Do you think I'll believe it?

80
00:10:29,075 --> 00:10:30,060
I won't join you, then.

81
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,020
Enjoy your fight.

82
00:10:31,075 --> 00:10:32,450
Your Highness, please.

83
00:10:34,525 --> 00:10:36,100
You want to kick me when I'm down?

84
00:10:39,475 --> 00:10:40,650
Facing the six martial slaves,

85
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,975
I don't think you'll be well protected.

86
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,140
What if I go no further

87
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,300
and leave for good?

88
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,540
Your Highness,
you're not that kind of person.

89
00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:52,940
You're right.

90
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,675
Your Highness,

91
00:10:55,675 --> 00:10:56,775
we're attacked from front and rear.

92
00:10:56,775 --> 00:10:57,850
The situation goes against us.

93
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,740
When soldiers are besieged by the enemy

94
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,725
and can't find a way out,

95
00:11:02,725 --> 00:11:03,740
what should they do?

96
00:11:05,575 --> 00:11:07,175
They should fight their way out.

97
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:16,875
Yes.

98
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,400
Fight our way out.

99
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,875
Iron Armor.

100
00:12:41,475 --> 00:12:42,250
Green Plum.

101
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,000
Bamboo Horse.

102
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,350
Spring Water.

103
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,125
Morning Dew.

104
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:45,875
Peach Blossom.

105
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:46,925
Rise.

106
00:12:51,925 --> 00:12:52,650
Go.

107
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,600
(North Gate)

108
00:13:35,275 --> 00:13:36,400
Why do you stop?

109
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,980
Deng Tai'e joined in.

110
00:13:39,675 --> 00:13:41,100
It makes no difference

111
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,350
whether they fight or not.

112
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:51,975
Come back.

113
00:13:59,075 --> 00:14:00,875
Thanks for the sword.

114
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,300
Thanks for the six swords.

115
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,825
Senior, if I may ask,

116
00:14:08,825 --> 00:14:10,380
are you Sword God Peach Blossom?

117
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,625
I am Deng Tai'e.

118
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,140
I remember

119
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,525
your kindness.

120
00:14:15,525 --> 00:14:16,580
I'll return the favor in the future.

121
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,100
You have nothing to return.

122
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,940
I was returning you a favor.

123
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:22,375
Xu Fengnian.

124
00:14:23,225 --> 00:14:24,075
Your mother

125
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,075
was a distant cousin to me.

126
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,800
Was that some kind of kinship?

127
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,975
How lucky he is

128
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,125
born in such a family.

129
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,925
When I was practicing swordplay
in Sword Tomb of the Wu family,

130
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,650
your mother did me many favors

131
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,380
of giving me meals,

132
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,375
saving my life,

133
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,175
and

134
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,000
giving me instruction.

135
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,800
Those were great favors.

136
00:14:44,275 --> 00:14:45,725
How could I not return?

137
00:14:49,575 --> 00:14:50,650
Sadly,

138
00:14:51,275 --> 00:14:53,675
when you mother
went to the imperial city alone,

139
00:14:53,975 --> 00:14:55,825
I was outside the East Sea.

140
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,580
When I came back,

141
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,975
it was too late.

142
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,015
She got hurt in fighting

143
00:15:02,425 --> 00:15:03,700
and was never cured.

144
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:05,775
At last, she died.

145
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,150
Every time I think about it,

146
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,675
I feel guilty.

147
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,100
The favors I owed to your mother,

148
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,175
today, I've returned a half

149
00:15:18,675 --> 00:15:20,220
using the six swords.

150
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,620
On the wall,

151
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,225
you can take

152
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:26,150
whatever you want to.

153
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,950
The 12 flying swords

154
00:15:44,275 --> 00:15:46,060
have been with me throughout my life.

155
00:15:46,275 --> 00:15:47,100
Today,

156
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,500
I give them to you.

157
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,000
The art of killing with flying swords

158
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,980
lies in the box.

159
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,060
It's up to you whether you can

160
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,475
comprehend it or not.

161
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,900
I've returned the other half

162
00:16:00,275 --> 00:16:01,650
of the favors.

163
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,675
Your Highness.

164
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,300
From now on,

165
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,025
we don't owe each other again.

166
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,150
Thanks.

167
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,460
Your Highness,
put the flying swords away first.

168
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,550
Later.

169
00:16:13,925 --> 00:16:15,350
The flying sword skill
of Sword God Peach Blossom

170
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,800
is supreme and unique.

171
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,850
I know.

172
00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:20,220
But I'm shortsighted.

173
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,100
Right now,

174
00:16:22,825 --> 00:16:24,900
the sword box
is the most important thing to me.

175
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,125
Mr. Deng,

176
00:16:32,475 --> 00:16:33,740
if you want to kill me,

177
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,860
you'd better do it early,

178
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,740
lest I'm agitated

179
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,300
waiting here.

180
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,700
I've returned all the favors

181
00:16:40,025 --> 00:16:41,260
and finished what has started.

182
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,525
He has nothing to do with me now.

183
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,575
So,

184
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,780
if I'm going to strike Xu Fengnian,

185
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,775
won't you use your swords?

186
00:16:47,775 --> 00:16:48,700
My swords

187
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,550
were given away.

188
00:16:52,825 --> 00:16:54,340
As Sword God Peach Blossom,

189
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,100
your every word must carry weight.

190
00:17:00,675 --> 00:17:01,350
Hm?

191
00:17:03,425 --> 00:17:04,380
Not now.

192
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,300
I'm not stupid.

193
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,875
The first half of the favors
Mr. Deng has to return

194
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,250
is to help your master

195
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,725
take the sword box on the wall.

196
00:17:12,075 --> 00:17:13,275
If I'm going to strike him,

197
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,740
I would wait until he gets the box

198
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,500
and Mr. Deng
finishes returning the favor.

199
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,275
Now, no one in the world

200
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,850
could stop your master

201
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,525
from getting the box.

202
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,000
Is this yours?

203
00:17:38,075 --> 00:17:39,260
His Highness's talking to you.

204
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,600
Answer the question.

205
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:43,900
It's mine.

206
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,050
Your Highness,

207
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,550
he is the new groom.

208
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:49,820
He doesn't need to

209
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:50,800
take the old stuff into the mansion.

210
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,425
Yeah.

211
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,380
How long have you been taking it?

212
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,380
Very long.

213
00:18:03,025 --> 00:18:04,540
It's your stuff.

214
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,420
Take it.

215
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,300
I don't necessarily need it.

216
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,675
My mother used to say,

217
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,675
what accompanied you

218
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:13,860
had a bond with you,

219
00:18:14,175 --> 00:18:16,575
no matter it's a person or a thing.

220
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,800
I don't quite understand it.

221
00:18:20,425 --> 00:18:22,820
Anyway, don't throw your old stuff away.

222
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,475
When you want it back in the future,

223
00:18:24,475 --> 00:18:25,420
how can you find it?

224
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:27,150
Yeah.

225
00:18:54,325 --> 00:18:55,550
Guess what I've found?

226
00:18:55,925 --> 00:18:56,625
Ah?

227
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,950
What did you find?

228
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:01,940
Look.

229
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,550
I got it back for you.

230
00:19:03,975 --> 00:19:04,600
I...

231
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,875
I don't necessarily need it.

232
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:07,220
All these years,

233
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,100
you've been taking it with you.

234
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,820
It must be important to you.

235
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,780
It's all in the past.

236
00:19:13,075 --> 00:19:15,050
Why deny the man who you used to be?

237
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,420
Don't you think he made the man

238
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,325
who you are today?

239
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,150
Anyway,

240
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,825
you're Old Huang to me.

241
00:19:22,475 --> 00:19:23,340
Since it was the will of heaven

242
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,850
that helped you find it...

243
00:19:26,525 --> 00:19:27,950
Don't throw it again.

244
00:19:27,975 --> 00:19:28,807
Yeah.

245
00:19:53,175 --> 00:19:54,325
What's your surname?

246
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:55,875
It's Huang.

247
00:19:56,925 --> 00:19:57,975
Oh.

248
00:19:58,075 --> 00:19:59,940
I'll call you Old Huang, then.

249
00:20:00,025 --> 00:20:00,820
OK.

copper and iron,

261
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,740
as well as spirit lifeblood
to forge swords.

262
00:22:52,075 --> 00:22:52,900
Today,

263
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,225
by force of yin and yang,

264
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,940
flame of heart light,

265
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,520
power of thunderbolt,

266
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,325
unity of heaven and earth,

267
00:23:01,225 --> 00:23:03,020
till now,

268
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:05,075
I finally perfected

269
00:23:07,925 --> 00:23:09,125
the sword intent.

270
00:23:40,025 --> 00:23:41,220
Open

271
00:23:41,475 --> 00:23:42,925
the Heaven's Gate.

272
00:23:52,075 --> 00:23:54,275
Li Chungang is a real sword god.

273
00:24:02,175 --> 00:24:03,200
Excellent.

274
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,020
My sword intent

275
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,060
could open the Heaven's Gate.

276
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,525
Could it kill you?

277
00:24:18,775 --> 00:24:19,950
What a great

278
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,200
sword intent!

279
00:24:46,575 --> 00:24:47,400
Junior Master,

280
00:24:47,525 --> 00:24:48,700
did you steal vegetables again?

281
00:24:57,875 --> 00:24:58,660
Junior Master.

282
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,540
What's wrong?

283
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,675
I have no idea.

284
00:25:00,725 --> 00:25:02,375
What did he find?

285
00:25:02,775 --> 00:25:04,025
He was just fine.

286
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:04,850
What happened to him?

287
00:25:04,925 --> 00:25:06,075
He was fine just now.

288
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:07,625
Junior Master.

289
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,425
- Don't touch him.
- Junior Master.

290
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:15,250
What happened?

291
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,025
Junior Master stood here still just now,

292
00:25:17,275 --> 00:25:18,475
gazing at the skyline.

293
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,350
Suddenly he became like this.

294
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,775
Which direction?

295
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,475
- There.
- There.

296
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,425
The east.

297
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,100
Put up a shed over his head.

298
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:34,875
And then?

299
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,125
Don't do anything else.

300
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,700
Wait till he wakes up.

301
00:25:44,975 --> 00:25:46,950
What happened in the east

302
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:50,550
that woke you up?

303
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,220
The moment finally comes.

304
00:26:41,175 --> 00:26:42,850
I've never seen such a fight.

305
00:26:43,775 --> 00:26:45,350
What an eye-opener!

306
00:26:46,325 --> 00:26:47,250
Do you think

307
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,675
they are still human?

308
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:50,900
Yes.

309
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,725
Oh?

310
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,460
I don't know about Wang Xianzhi.

311
00:26:54,575 --> 00:26:56,100
But Sword God Li is definitely human.

312
00:26:57,425 --> 00:26:58,675
Have you got the sword box?

313
00:27:00,725 --> 00:27:02,660
Can I fight you now?

314
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,100
Do you think you have any chance?

315
00:27:10,675 --> 00:27:12,225
Sword God Li is busy now.

316
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,975
Do you think he can take care of you?

317
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,725
There is another one hiding in here?

318
00:27:35,175 --> 00:27:36,860
Sword God Peach Blossom

319
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:39,650
didn't just come for
Xu Fengnian, did you?

320
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:43,050
Nice to meet you, Master Zhao.

321
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:46,575
Do you know me?

322
00:27:47,775 --> 00:27:49,000
Though I've never met you,

323
00:27:49,975 --> 00:27:51,325
your name

324
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,250
pierced my ear like thunder.

325
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:55,100
What a coincidence.

326
00:27:56,025 --> 00:27:57,700
Of the few people who know me,

327
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,725
I actually come across one.

328
00:28:01,975 --> 00:28:03,150
You're lucky.

329
00:28:03,675 --> 00:28:04,600
I don't understand.

330
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,725
After Li Chungang and Wang Xianzhi
started to fight,

331
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,900
I was planning to kill you,

332
00:28:10,925 --> 00:28:12,700
but in my heart lake,

333
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,820
I perceived a peerless master

334
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,500
outside Wudi City.

335
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:19,580
I then decided to wait,

336
00:28:20,275 --> 00:28:21,820
not expecting it was
Sword God Peach Blossom

337
00:28:22,175 --> 00:28:24,475
who came to pay a debt of gratitude.

338
00:28:24,975 --> 00:28:27,300
When you fought
the martial slaves just now,

339
00:28:27,775 --> 00:28:28,800
did you hide your capacities?

340
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,300
I was messing with them.

341
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:31,825
Why should I be serious?

342
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,225
What's your real identity?

343
00:28:36,025 --> 00:28:38,450
There is no need to hide it now.

344
00:28:39,275 --> 00:28:41,300
I'm from Mount Longhu,

345
00:28:41,575 --> 00:28:43,140
Zhao Xuansu.

346
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,180
The generation of Xuan?

347
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,050
Your Highness,

348
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:47,260
the generation of Xuan
is two generations senior

349
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,260
than the Master of Mount Longhu.

350
00:28:48,725 --> 00:28:49,725
I'm afraid Master Zhao

351
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,850
is almost 140 years old.

352
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,325
I've guessed you might attack me,

353
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,200
not expecting you are of
such a high generation.

354
00:28:57,525 --> 00:28:59,175
It must be hard for you

355
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,275
to call me Brother these days.

356
00:29:01,275 --> 00:29:02,620
I don't care about it.

357
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,050
Why should you care?

358
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,175
May I venture to ask
if you still want to kill me?

359
00:29:08,925 --> 00:29:11,125
I was planning to do so.

360
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,425
But Deng Tai'e is here, after all.

361
00:29:13,975 --> 00:29:16,175
I should show some respect to him.

362
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:18,740
Senior,

363
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:21,750
you come to kill Xu Fengnian, too?

364
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,700
Senior Deng just said,

365
00:29:24,975 --> 00:29:26,660
he had finished returning favors.

366
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,500
From now on,

367
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,875
Xu Fengnian's life or death
has nothing to do with him.

368
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,620
This Young Master

369
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,525
deserves to be killed.

370
00:29:35,575 --> 00:29:37,300
I'd like to join hands with you.

371
00:29:37,975 --> 00:29:39,660
If Senior Deng doesn't help,

372
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,900
these people

373
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,740
can't stop you.

374
00:29:43,675 --> 00:29:46,175
The Fujiang Armor below is yours?

375
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,800
If you like,

376
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,340
just take it.

377
00:29:49,575 --> 00:29:51,425
Are you Zhao Kai?

378
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,025
You know me?

379
00:29:55,275 --> 00:29:57,375
I won't kill Xu Fengnian.

380
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,675
It makes

381
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:02,600
no difference to kill you.

382
00:30:17,725 --> 00:30:20,250
Do you try to resist me with a puppet?

383
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,150
If I said or did anything wrong,

384
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,410
I apologize for it.

385
00:30:27,275 --> 00:30:30,100
Xu Fengnian is the cause of chaos,

386
00:30:30,225 --> 00:30:31,700
so are you.

387
00:30:32,325 --> 00:30:34,725
Mount Longhu is in debt to His Majesty.

388
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,750
Let me kill you today

389
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,175
to return the favor.

390
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,220
Are you crazy?

391
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,750
Why do you save him?

392
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,250
Senior Zhao, please go easy on him.

393
00:30:45,575 --> 00:30:47,425
He was trying to kill you all the way.

394
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:51,925
Can you tell me

395
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,950
why you want to

396
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,225
save me?

397
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,000
You shouldn't

398
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,075
die here.

399
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,475
Why don't you run?

400
00:31:29,525 --> 00:31:31,250
Thinking about it over and over again,

401
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,425
I still don't know the reason
why you saved him.

402
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,275
Normally,

403
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,300
you might be crazy.

404
00:31:39,075 --> 00:31:40,020
I might be.

405
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,450
But I know,

406
00:31:41,725 --> 00:31:43,950
you're deep-minded.

407
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:45,950
The reason

408
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:46,940
why you saved him

409
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,325
must be extremely important.

410
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,900
I apologize.

411
00:31:54,225 --> 00:31:55,660
Young people

412
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,500
are more and more surprising now.

413
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,800
If Deng Tai'e isn't here,

414
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,325
I might have killed you.

415
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,000
Please show mercy

416
00:32:07,275 --> 00:32:08,350
and let those two go.

417
00:32:10,975 --> 00:32:13,675
Anyway, you'll get
what you deserve in the future.

418
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,175
What was happening?

419
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,300
Thank you very much.

420
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,400
You didn't come here

421
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,250
just to kill us, did you?

422
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:01,425
Yeah.

423
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,140
I'll take the chance to ascend to heaven

424
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,200
when Heaven's Gate opens.

425
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,350
Heaven's Gate?

426
00:33:06,775 --> 00:33:08,450
When you come to the
ultimate realm of martial arts,

427
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,620
you may have the chance to
become an immortal.

428
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,025
To do that,

429
00:33:12,025 --> 00:33:13,700
you must wait till Heaven's Gate opens.

430
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:16,075
Though I look like a boy,

431
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,780
I'm getting rotten inwardly.

432
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,220
After all,
I've been waiting for 120 years.

433
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,300
Why did you tell me this?

434
00:33:23,525 --> 00:33:25,600
I finally get the chance
ascending to heaven.

435
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,850
It doesn't hurt to tell you.

436
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:33,200
Heaven's Gate reopens

437
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:36,275
because of the fight between
Sword God Li and Wang Xianzhi?

438
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,875
I'm afraid the gate only reopens

439
00:33:39,025 --> 00:33:40,860
because of their fight.

440
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,675
I'm not wrong.

441
00:33:43,675 --> 00:33:45,250
The gate is opening.

442
00:33:45,825 --> 00:33:47,375
The wonderland will befall.

443
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,700
I can finally take the step.

444
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,100
Sword God Peach Blossom

445
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,525
came here

446
00:33:56,275 --> 00:33:58,425
for this, too, I suppose.

447
00:33:58,425 --> 00:33:59,420
You're right.

448
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,825
I do come for Heaven's Gate.

449
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:08,150
The gate is about to open.

450
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,700
We both have the chance to ascend.

451
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,975
Maybe we can work together.

452
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,850
They're fighting
with all their strength.

453
00:34:59,925 --> 00:35:01,325
It's only one step away.

454
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:07,820
Shall we continue?

455
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:10,475
Heaven's Gate is opening.

456
00:35:23,775 --> 00:35:26,225
The outcome is still pending.

457
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,260
What are they doing?

458
00:35:40,475 --> 00:35:41,740
Why do they stop?

459
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,700
For decades,

460
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,350
this is the only chance
to open Heaven's Gate.

461
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,050
Are they going to let it go?

462
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,475
Maybe they don't want to

463
00:35:49,825 --> 00:35:51,300
ascend to heaven.

464
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,100
They don't want to?

465
00:35:54,925 --> 00:35:56,025
Why not?

466
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:57,700
They perhaps would rather stay on earth

467
00:35:58,775 --> 00:36:00,725
than go to the wonderland.

468
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,175
What on earth deserves to stay for?

469
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,585
How can they miss the chance?

470
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,780
The moment has already come.

471
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,525
With extra force,

472
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:15,375
we can open Heaven's Gate

473
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,000
and welcome the wonderland.

474
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,275
In this case,

475
00:36:20,075 --> 00:36:22,200
let me open the gate.

476
00:36:23,275 --> 00:36:24,175
Rise.

477
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:34,925
Deng Tai'e, what are you doing?

478
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,540
You just said something wrong.

479
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:40,700
I do come here

480
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:43,460
for Heaven's Gate.

481
00:36:43,775 --> 00:36:44,625
However,

482
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,820
I don't want it to open.

483
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:48,525
What do you want, then?

484
00:36:50,425 --> 00:36:51,600
I want to

485
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,980
stop it from opening

486
00:36:54,275 --> 00:36:55,350
and cut off the connection

487
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,775
between the wonderland and the earth.

488
00:36:57,775 --> 00:36:58,750
Why?

489
00:36:59,225 --> 00:37:00,300
Ancient books

490
00:37:00,475 --> 00:37:01,660
have recorded

491
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,140
the visits of immortals.

492
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:05,725
The so-called immortals

493
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:08,075
have long cast their mortal hearts away.

494
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,820
They think they represent heaven's way.

495
00:37:10,275 --> 00:37:11,860
Every time when immortals befall,

496
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:13,300
they would change

497
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:16,100
the world's situation at will.

498
00:37:16,225 --> 00:37:17,540
Diversion of rivers

499
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,450
and shift of mountains

500
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,580
usually happen.

501
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:21,550
What's more,

502
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,940
some immortals would decide
human's life or death

503
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:26,100
according to their likes and dislikes.

504
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:29,050
Numerous people die

505
00:37:29,675 --> 00:37:31,475
because of them.

506
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,170
So what?

507
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,725
The change of dynasties in the world

508
00:37:35,725 --> 00:37:37,325
also causes numerous death.

509
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,125
If nothing else,

510
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,180
he is the son of Lord of North Liang.

511
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:44,460
How many people died
because of his father?

512
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,950
Why don't you kill him?

513
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,725
The change of dynasties

514
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,100
is the struggle of human.

515
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,540
I've never wanted to

516
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:54,420
stop all the killings in the world.

517
00:37:56,175 --> 00:37:57,175
As a matter of fact,

518
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,250
the swordplay I've been practicing

519
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:02,250
is the art of killing.

520
00:38:03,475 --> 00:38:04,940
But human's affairs

521
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:07,100
should be decided by human.

522
00:38:07,825 --> 00:38:08,875
The mortal world

523
00:38:09,125 --> 00:38:10,550
doesn't need immortals.

524
00:38:10,775 --> 00:38:12,025
Just because of that,

525
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:14,350
you want to stop Heaven's Gate
from reopening,

526
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:16,780
and block the way
of all martial artists in the world?

527
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,380
I am

528
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,375
never a reasonable man.

529
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:22,780
Stopping me from ascending,

530
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:24,980
you're my sworn enemy.

531
00:38:27,925 --> 00:38:29,375
You can't stop me, anyway!

532
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:32,540
Emei, Rosefinch,

533
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,260
Phoenix Tree, Ant,

534
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,225
Golden Thread, Tai'e,

535
00:38:34,225 --> 00:38:34,825
rise.

536
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,450
Swords array.

537
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,525
The swords array is called Disarm.

538
00:38:39,625 --> 00:38:41,500
It was originally
prepared for Wang Xianzhi.

539
00:38:41,725 --> 00:38:42,750
I didn't expect

540
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:44,580
I would use it against you.

541
00:38:44,925 --> 00:38:46,475
I'd like to see

542
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,125
if you can really disarm me.

543
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:56,918
Go.

544
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,100
Power of stars,

545
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,350
might of thunder?

546
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:13,925
Deng Tai'e,

547
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,850
how dare you?

548
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:16,875
Go.

549
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,600
Deng Tai'e,

550
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,150
you stand in my way of ascending.

551
00:40:33,675 --> 00:40:36,675
I must kill
all your relatives and friends.

552
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:40,325
Master Zhao,

553
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,000
stop now,

554
00:40:42,475 --> 00:40:43,975
and your life can be saved.

555
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,800
Why bother like this?

556
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:56,850
Doing that,

557
00:40:57,475 --> 00:40:59,375
you'll kill yourself.

558
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,150
Being in Unity Realm,

559
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,325
how can I be confined?

560
00:41:15,975 --> 00:41:17,260
I'm sick

561
00:41:18,825 --> 00:41:20,450
of the world!

562
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,875
Born human,

563
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,025
but you're sick of the world.

564
00:41:31,725 --> 00:41:33,350
How pathetic you are!

565
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:36,225
Since we've achieved to Unity Realm,

566
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,275
we're no longer an ordinary person.

567
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:41,575
In order to get stronger,

568
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:43,325
are you really going

569
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:44,900
