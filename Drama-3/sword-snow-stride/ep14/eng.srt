1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

5
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
=Sword Snow Stride=
(Season 1)

6
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,400
=Episode 14=

7
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,700
Where are Ning Emei
and his Fengzi Battalion?

8
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,375
One li behind us.
[*li: unit of length, equals 500 meters.]

9
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,740
When they're so far away,

10
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,860
how can they protect you?

11
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,500
We have Senior, don't we?

12
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,125
Xu Fengnian is quite scheming.

13
00:02:11,575 --> 00:02:12,700
He has transferred Fengzi Battalion away

14
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,200
because he expects assassins.

15
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:16,660
When you use your martial arts,

16
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,100
he'll know who you are?

17
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,375
Clever girl.

18
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:23,725
But he's got the wrong plan.

19
00:02:24,575 --> 00:02:25,660
Fengnian, I'll only keep you alive.

20
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:26,900
Even if all your subordinates
are killed,

21
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,900
I won't care.

22
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,450
Fengnian should be
out of Yongzhou, right?

23
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,575
Upon their traveling speed,

24
00:02:36,575 --> 00:02:37,900
he should be.

25
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,750
Out of Yongzhou,

26
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,275
they'll be arriving in Qingzhou.

27
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,075
Lord of Jing'an in Qingzhou

28
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,540
is always at loggerheads with us.

29
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,775
I'm afraid

30
00:02:48,775 --> 00:02:50,650
His Highness will
have some mishaps there.

31
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,050
Chu Lushan.

32
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,275
Here.

33
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,325
Don't go to the capital city with me.

34
00:02:56,925 --> 00:02:58,750
But I promised His Highness.

35
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,860
How many days does it take

36
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,020
when you travel light to Qingzhou?

37
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,020
Two days only.

38
00:03:05,725 --> 00:03:06,475
Oh.

39
00:03:08,175 --> 00:03:08,975
You...

40
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,060
Stay by the gate of my mansion.

41
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,620
Once you receive the sword tassel
carried by the hawk,

42
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:14,525
lead your cavalry

43
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:16,580
to Qingzhou immediately.

44
00:03:17,225 --> 00:03:18,900
Godfather, you want me

45
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,600
to invade Qingzhou?

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,575
No, or we would be rebelling.

47
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:25,700
Then what should I do in Qingzhou?

48
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,575
Fengnian will tell you.

49
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,325
What about you?

50
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,700
Many people in the capital city
want me to be dead.

51
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,740
But once I'm there,

52
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,660
no one dares to kill me.

53
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,100
Instead, they'll do everything possible

54
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,275
to keep me alive.

55
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,300
Do you know why?

56
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:48,650
With North Liang Army around,

57
00:03:49,175 --> 00:03:51,325
you can live without any anxiety!

58
00:03:52,725 --> 00:03:53,420
Here I go.

59
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:00,820
Godfather.

60
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,475
What?

61
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,620
Who'll lead North Liang Army?

62
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,700
No one can guard North Liang,

63
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,225
but Chen Zhibao.

64
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,007
(Liang)

65
00:04:31,675 --> 00:04:32,950
Hawk.

66
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,175
Sword tassel.

67
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,900
Go fetch my bed.

68
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,900
I'll be waiting here
for the sword tassel.

69
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:53,220
I'm talking to you.

70
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,025
Go move my bed here.

71
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:54,650
Yes.

72
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,375
Quickly!

73
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:00,140
Armor.

74
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,525
Fujiang Armor?

75
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,900
Grandpa Wei, you know him?

76
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,020
When I was as young as you,

77
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:10,850
in this world,

78
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,275
there used to be four Great Masters.

79
00:06:12,275 --> 00:06:13,420
One of them

80
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,675
was Fujiang Armor

81
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:16,000
from the South.

82
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,725
The man ahead of us?

83
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:31,675
But...

84
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,140
When Fujiang Armor

85
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,540
assassinated the late emperor,

86
00:06:34,825 --> 00:06:36,060
Cruel Cat Han Diaosi

87
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,300
took off the Armor personally.

88
00:06:37,475 --> 00:06:38,775
His dead body and the Armor

89
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:40,475
were hung on the flag for display.

90
00:06:40,975 --> 00:06:42,200
It can't be faked.

91
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,660
That's weird.

92
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,575
Where did he get this armor?

93
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,050
Can he be the child
of Fujiang Armor?

94
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,125
No way.

95
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,740
There's only one Fujiang Armor
in this world.

96
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,725
Now,

97
00:06:52,725 --> 00:06:54,350
the Armor should be kept
in the Imperial Palace.

98
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:55,780
Let me try him out.

99
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,850
You don't need to take the risk.

100
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,075
Shu Xiu.

101
00:06:59,075 --> 00:06:59,950
Lyu Qiantang.

102
00:07:03,675 --> 00:07:04,700
May I borrow your horse?

103
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,740
As you wish.

104
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,020
Which one of us should go first?

105
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:17,225
Shouldn't we go in turn?

106
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,850
He's alive.

107
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:50,500
Luckily,

108
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,225
he's not Fujiang Armor Man
among four Great Masters.

109
00:07:53,725 --> 00:07:55,050
Who told you that?

110
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:57,980
Fujiang Armor

111
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,340
should have been stronger.

112
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,860
The Armor is from Mount Longhu.

113
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,300
It's ancient armor.

114
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,180
But few people know

115
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,100
that it can be divided into five armors,

116
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,340
referring to five elements.

117
00:08:07,575 --> 00:08:09,450
Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth?

118
00:08:10,725 --> 00:08:11,925
This is the Water Armor.

119
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,900
It's the strongest in the heavy rain.

120
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,725
They can't defeat him.

121
00:08:15,975 --> 00:08:17,050
Ask them to get out of the way.

122
00:08:17,525 --> 00:08:18,475
Stop.

123
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,180
Come back!

124
00:08:43,075 --> 00:08:44,425
He's coming towards me.

125
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:27,800
It's over?

126
00:09:34,725 --> 00:09:36,460
When Fujiang Armor is divided
into five bodies,

127
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,325
they aren't as strong as the entirety.

128
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,860
But they still can't be easily defeated.

129
00:09:47,675 --> 00:09:48,940
He isn't dead yet?

130
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,225
A living death.

131
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,375
He's not exactly a living person.

132
00:10:13,275 --> 00:10:14,800
Making Immortals Kneel.

133
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,380
Is he a human

134
00:11:24,075 --> 00:11:25,175
or is he an immortal?

135
00:11:52,775 --> 00:11:54,060
This old man is quite strong.

136
00:11:54,825 --> 00:11:56,180
I'm afraid I can't defeat him.

137
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,140
It's really hard
to kill my brother-in-law.

138
00:11:59,975 --> 00:12:01,140
I can't assassinate him directly.

139
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,300
I'll wait for another chance.

140
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,100
Luckily, I use the blade.

141
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,700
Otherwise,

142
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,580
when I saw how you used the sword,

143
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,740
I would have psychological scars

144
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,260
and never dare to use the sword again.

145
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,975
You don't use the blade
very well, either.

146
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,000
What do you think of that, girl?

147
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,975
Not as good as White Fox.

148
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,875
She's strong.

149
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,800
But far worse than me.

150
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,780
She uses two blades
much more beautifully.

151
00:13:10,925 --> 00:13:12,800
I can use the sword beautifully, too.

152
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,900
She looks prettier than you.

153
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,550
Ah?

154
00:13:15,725 --> 00:13:17,000
Seriously?

155
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,340
So, I won't be your disciple.

156
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,375
Think no more of it.

157
00:13:21,225 --> 00:13:22,180
You are

158
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,860
as talented as Xu Fengnian.

159
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,050
If you learn from me,
you'll be a master.

160
00:13:27,025 --> 00:13:28,350
Considering my identity,

161
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,340
the stronger I am,

162
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,225
the sooner I'll die.

163
00:13:31,425 --> 00:13:33,380
You're afraid
that Xu Fengnian will kill you?

164
00:13:33,575 --> 00:13:34,900
I don't think he wants that.

165
00:13:35,075 --> 00:13:35,835
Bah.

166
00:13:36,075 --> 00:13:37,500
He's sinister and ruthless.

167
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,800
He can do anything.

168
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:39,780
I can teach you.

169
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,980
Then you can defeat him.

170
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,820
I won't learn.

171
00:13:42,975 --> 00:13:43,900
It's hard to learn martial arts.

172
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:46,875
Let me know when you want to learn.

173
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,650
Why must you teach me?

174
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,400
You're talented.

175
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,700
And you act arrogantly.

176
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,100
I like that.

177
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:00,700
What about him?

178
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
He has a good talent.

179
00:14:04,675 --> 00:14:06,140
But he's scheming.

180
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,350
I'll keep observing him.

181
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,300
The two strokes

182
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,825
killed him.

183
00:14:30,825 --> 00:14:31,900
But he looks alive.

184
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,580
The last breath, I'm afraid.

185
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,800
Dude,

186
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,420
who are you?

187
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:39,820
Why did you come to kill me?

188
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,500
Looks like he doesn't want to tell me.

189
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,075
It's not that
he doesn't want to tell you.

190
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,220
He just can't tell you.

191
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,325
Why?

192
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:52,475
I checked on him.

193
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,580
He's mentally disturbed.

194
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,180
Mentally disturbed?

195
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,075
But he was fighting normally.

196
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,620
Look.

197
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,375
It's carved

198
00:15:07,475 --> 00:15:08,175
all over the inner side of the Armor.

199
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:09,260
What's it?

200
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,375
As for the secret pattern,

201
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,625
you have to ask that senior
in your carriage, I guess.

202
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,020
Look.

203
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,375
What's this?

204
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,225
A piece of armor.

205
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,340
What's carved on this side?

206
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,300
It looks mysterious.

207
00:15:34,775 --> 00:15:37,925
I'm afraid no one knows it.

208
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,775
It's evil of you.

209
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,820
You're talking in riddles.

210
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:43,180
You know?

211
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,660
Tell us, then.

212
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,575
It's the genuine spirit.

213
00:15:48,725 --> 00:15:49,850
Genuine spirit?

214
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,725
The pattern is carved
with special material,

215
00:15:52,975 --> 00:15:54,700
for the circulation of genuine spirit.

216
00:15:55,175 --> 00:15:57,200
Genuine spirit circulates
through the patterns?

217
00:15:57,275 --> 00:15:58,700
More than that.

218
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,060
The patterns can also
store genuine spirit.

219
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,820
Most wonderfully,

220
00:16:02,175 --> 00:16:04,100
the patterns can transmit
genuine spirit to this part.

221
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,600
Head?

222
00:16:06,225 --> 00:16:07,580
So, the man out there

223
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,780
isn't born with superhuman strength.

224
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,500
Fujiang Armor is vicious.

225
00:16:12,075 --> 00:16:13,000
A batch of death guards

226
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,820
have been trained.

227
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,660
Genuine spirit stored in the Armor

228
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,820
can help them to kill.

229
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,740
That's why I killed that man.

230
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:21,020
Because everybody in the Armor

231
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,275
would rather die than surrender.

232
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,650
(Unknown man)
It's all right that we buried him.

233
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,500
(Unknown man)
Why do we take away the Armor?

234
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,775
(Unknown man)
It's quite an evil armor.

235
00:16:39,775 --> 00:16:40,620
(Unknown man)
Let's study it.

236
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,460
He said there were five Fujiang Armors.

237
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,380
But only one came to kill me.

238
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,260
It's hard to say
if the other four would come.

239
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,450
Who told you only one came?

240
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,700
Three armors were waiting
in the woods just now.

241
00:16:53,025 --> 00:16:53,925
Just now?

242
00:16:53,925 --> 00:16:54,625
Yes.

243
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:55,820
Why didn't they come out?

244
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,420
They were scared of me, of course.

245
00:16:59,050 --> 00:16:59,875
Wait.

246
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,460
Only four in total.

247
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,300
Where's the fifth one?

248
00:17:02,575 --> 00:17:03,860
How do I know?

249
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:05,700
Oh, no!

250
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,540
Ning Emei.

251
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,180
Your Highness.

252
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:11,860
Your Highness.

253
00:17:18,475 --> 00:17:19,380
You were attacked?

254
00:17:19,475 --> 00:17:20,200
Your Highness,

255
00:17:20,525 --> 00:17:22,420
a man in Armor
attacked Fengzi Battalion.

256
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,220
What happened in the end?

257
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:24,600
I'm sorry.

258
00:17:24,975 --> 00:17:26,620
More than forty soldiers
were wounded or dead.

259
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,150
But we failed to keep him.

260
00:17:28,475 --> 00:17:29,620
We only drove him off.

261
00:17:30,025 --> 00:17:30,780
In the end,

262
00:17:31,325 --> 00:17:32,775
he ran away.

263
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,075
Please punish me, Your Highness.

264
00:17:38,075 --> 00:17:39,000
I beg you

265
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,000
to spare the remaining soldiers
of Fengzi Battalion.

266
00:17:44,325 --> 00:17:45,600
According to military rules
of North Liang Army,

267
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,925
how should generals and soldiers
be punished

268
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:49,125
for incompetence and failure?

269
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,780
Flogging is the least punishment.

270
00:17:52,275 --> 00:17:53,340
Beheading is the harshest.

271
00:17:54,025 --> 00:17:55,740
We ran into a man in Armor, too.

272
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,500
They two couldn't fight him.

273
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:00,500
You've already done a good job

274
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,340
when you drove him off.

275
00:18:01,475 --> 00:18:02,660
Let me ask you.

276
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,125
During the fight,

277
00:18:04,825 --> 00:18:05,900
did anyone of Fengzi Battalion

278
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,180
shrink back?

279
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:08,825
None of them ever shrank back.

280
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,460
Fengzi Battalion's men die in battle,

281
00:18:10,725 --> 00:18:11,950
but they never run for their lives.

282
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:12,725
Good point.

283
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,060
When half of you were wounded or dead,

284
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,000
but you still fought bravely.

285
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,775
You're indeed valiant.

286
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,925
You fought bravely and won.

287
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,380
You're not guilty, but meritorious.

288
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,175
You may rise.

289
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:30,800
Thank you, Your Highness,

290
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,200
on behalf of Fengzi Battalion.

291
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,125
Take the remaining soldiers

292
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:38,350
back to North Liang.

293
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:40,300
Looks like

294
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,180
I'm going on a trip to destruction.

295
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,075
North Liang Cavalry
is never afraid of death.

296
00:18:44,075 --> 00:18:45,780
Shouldn't dead soldiers be taken home?

297
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,400
Take them back to North Liang

298
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:50,700
and catch up with me.

299
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,800
I'll slow down and wait for you.

300
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,325
It was a nice trick to buy them over.

301
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,180
It's hard to judge Ning Emei.

302
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,220
But I think the other soldiers

303
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,620
would like to die for you.

304
00:19:22,925 --> 00:19:24,700
It's not that easy
to buy over Fengzi Battalion.

305
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:26,900
I don't want them to die, either.

306
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:28,020
You're the son
of the Lord of North Liang.

307
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,900
It's justified that they die for you.

308
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,020
I take over North Liang,

309
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,980
just to eliminate such justified things.

310
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,820
You're a weird man.

311
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,475
Forget it.

312
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,420
Your sword moves were earthshaking.

313
00:19:41,525 --> 00:19:43,700
I can't help asking who you are.

314
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,125
I use swords.

315
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,575
You can guess.

316
00:19:47,325 --> 00:19:48,550
Don't bother.

317
00:19:49,525 --> 00:19:50,780
He's Li Chungang.

318
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,050
(God of Sword Li Chungang)
How did you know?

319
00:19:57,725 --> 00:19:59,225
God of Sword Li Chungang?

320
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,460
Sixty years ago,

321
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,020
God of Sword Li Chungang was famous
all over the world.

322
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,140
He used his sword Mumaniu

323
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,180
to fight everywhere
and no one defeated him.

324
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,325
I've heard about your sword.

325
00:20:10,325 --> 00:20:12,845
I nearly forgot who I was.

326
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:16,200
Who else could remember Mumaniu?

327
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:22,900
So, you heard it.

328
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,775
Sixty years ago?

329
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:26,500
How old are you now?

330
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,075
Those who practice genuine spirit
live longer than those who don't.

331
00:20:29,475 --> 00:20:30,775
With Dahuangting in your body,

332
00:20:30,775 --> 00:20:32,300
you'll live longer than me.

333
00:20:32,475 --> 00:20:34,620
Now that you're the former God of Sword,

334
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,425
where's your sword?

335
00:20:35,425 --> 00:20:36,300
Jiang Ni!

336
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:38,050
What? It's taboo?

337
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,250
Nothing is taboo.

338
00:20:39,825 --> 00:20:41,050
In the fight against Wang Xianzhi,

339
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:41,900
he broke my sword Mumaniu

340
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,180
with his two fingers.

341
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,980
He won?

342
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,740
My sword was even broken.

343
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,025
He certainly won.

344
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:51,275
Then you're going
to challenge Wang Xianzhi?

345
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,820
I just want to get back the sword box.

346
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,660
I don't have to challenge him.

347
00:20:56,925 --> 00:20:59,350
You knew Xu Fengnian would
visit Wudi City?

348
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,060
I did.

349
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,475
Then why are you still going?

350
00:21:02,825 --> 00:21:04,125
You think

351
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:05,540
I've been hiding underground

352
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,820
because I'm scared of Wang Xianzhi

353
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,075
for losing to him
and having my sword broken?

354
00:21:08,325 --> 00:21:09,475
Isn't it the fact?

355
00:21:09,475 --> 00:21:10,380
Losing a fight

356
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,325
never scares me.

357
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,325
I stayed hidden

358
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:16,200
only because

359
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:20,425
I realized that I was an idiot.

360
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:32,725
(Mount Qingcheng)

361
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:33,575
Your Highness,

362
00:21:33,575 --> 00:21:34,740
if we choose

363
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,950
to make a detour,

364
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,740
it'll take us less than a day
to leave Yongzhou.

365
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,340
But if we go through
the back of the mountain,

366
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,580
I'm afraid it'll take a couple of days.

367
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,740
I know.

368
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,075
Your Highness,

369
00:21:46,025 --> 00:21:46,740
is he

370
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,275
really Li Chungang?

371
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:50,850
Yes, I think.

372
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,275
What's wrong?

373
00:21:56,725 --> 00:21:57,775
Why are you so excited

374
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,020
about his name?

375
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,175
He's God of Sword Li Chungang.

376
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,050
Masters appear one after another
in the martial world.

377
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,775
But he was the strongest
for fifty years.

378
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,580
His swordsmanship

379
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,950
was the best in the world.

380
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,260
He was the coolest swordsman

381
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,775
in the world, too.

382
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,940
Girls were crazy about him.

383
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,450
Other swordsmen admired him.

384
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,460
Shu Xiu,

385
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,180
are you crazy about him, too?

386
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,450
I grew up,
hearing a lot about his legends.

387
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:26,825
To me,

388
00:22:27,025 --> 00:22:30,300
he's like the real god.

389
00:22:32,975 --> 00:22:34,650
Qingniao, you don't look excited.

390
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,325
I'm a mere maid.

391
00:22:36,325 --> 00:22:37,580
I love rich guys.

392
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,740
I'm not interested

393
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,540
in a poor old man.

394
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,425
Lin,

395
00:22:41,425 --> 00:22:42,400
what about you?

396
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,460
Lyu Qiantang,

397
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,300
what about you?

398
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,825
Lyu Qiantang!

399
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,460
I'm a scholar!

400
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,875
If he could be Number One Scholar,

401
00:22:52,025 --> 00:22:53,420
I would admire him.

402
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,340
Boring man.

403
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,380
Let's hurry up.

404
00:22:58,650 --> 00:22:59,650
We'll live in the Taoist temple tonight

405
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:00,580
where we can be sheltered.

406
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,525
Why do I feel the closer
we get to Mount Qingcheng,

407
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,500
the happier His Highness looks?

408
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:41,860
How do you know here's a Taoist temple?

409
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,350
I divined.

410
00:23:43,975 --> 00:23:45,220
You're awesome, then.

411
00:23:50,575 --> 00:23:51,475
Your Highness,

412
00:23:52,175 --> 00:23:53,100
the Taoist temple

413
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,700
is a little bit weird.

414
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,020
How?

415
00:23:56,175 --> 00:23:57,220
Trees in the backyard

416
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,650
have been cut down.

417
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:59,675
Oh.

418
00:24:01,275 --> 00:24:02,500
They were used

419
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,275
to make a fire.

420
00:24:06,025 --> 00:24:07,220
Make a fire?

421
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,750
I failed to find the firewood.

422
00:24:08,975 --> 00:24:10,140
Then I cut down the trees.

423
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:13,770
So,

424
00:24:14,075 --> 00:24:15,460
you came here, Your Highness?

425
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,950
Three years ago,
Old Huang and I lived here.

426
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,125
You once had a hard life.

427
00:24:39,425 --> 00:24:40,900
Shu Xiu and Lyu Qiantang

428
00:24:41,525 --> 00:24:42,540
went out for hunting.

429
00:24:42,725 --> 00:24:43,820
Let's see

430
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,500
if they can take back some game meat.

431
00:24:46,175 --> 00:24:47,550
It's good to have more people.

432
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,450
When Old Huang and I stayed here,

433
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:50,460
neither of us wanted to go out for food

434
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,775
even if we fainted from hunger.

435
00:25:18,325 --> 00:25:19,050
Hey.

436
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:21,340
Come over.

437
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:32,415
Quick.

438
00:25:37,175 --> 00:25:38,060
What?

439
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:40,900
What's this?

440
00:25:42,025 --> 00:25:43,140
Let's knock them out.

441
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,925
Fengzi Battalion is away.

442
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,740
Tonight is the best chance.

443
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,980
Lyu Qiantang used to be a scholar.

444
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:51,660
Looks like he doesn't have
great martial arts.

445
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,950
Let's take him down first.

446
00:25:54,525 --> 00:25:55,975
You know him a lot.

447
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,925
Have you heard me?

448
00:26:00,925 --> 00:26:02,400
It's a deal, then.

449
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:13,380
You even found the white chickens

450
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,620
on Mount Qingcheng.

451
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,700
I'm getting a great feast.

452
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:17,050
I'm glad you like it.

453
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:18,225
Where's Lyu Qiantang?

454
00:26:18,675 --> 00:26:19,540
Out there.

455
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,575
He said he would guard the carriage.

456
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,550
Ignore him.

457
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,740
He always pulls a long face.

458
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,700
How annoying!

459
00:26:24,025 --> 00:26:24,650
Come on.

460
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,800
I want the drumstick.

461
00:26:29,425 --> 00:26:30,800
Old Huang likes drumsticks, too.

462
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,180
Jian Jiuhuang?

463
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,175
I only know he's Old Huang.

464
00:26:35,425 --> 00:26:36,500
He's gluttonous and lazy.

465
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,125
He's best at broiling sweet potatoes.

466
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:46,100
Come on.

467
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,125
Help yourself.

468
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,375
Why are you holding a stick?

469
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,420
To add fuel to the fire.

470
00:27:04,425 --> 00:27:05,750
Ridiculous.

471
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:14,860
Your Highness,

472
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,625
how long did you stay here
with Old Huang three years ago?

473
00:27:18,425 --> 00:27:19,575
For a few days.

474
00:27:23,025 --> 00:27:23,860
Why...?

475
00:27:25,025 --> 00:27:26,250
Why did you stay here?

476
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,500
We didn't stay.

477
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,500
We were caught by bandits.

478
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,900
Bandits on Mount Qingcheng?

479
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,725
Yeah.

480
00:27:35,075 --> 00:27:36,250
They came, upon seeing the flare.

481
00:27:36,675 --> 00:27:37,820
They didn't kill you?

482
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,050
They were stupid bandits.

483
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,325
Some were old and some were young.

484
00:27:42,775 --> 00:27:44,400
When they saw starving Old Huang and me,

485
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:46,060
they gave us half of the roast chicken.

486
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,225
What good luck you had!

487
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,260
We became friends later.

488
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:51,660
When I left Mount Qingcheng,

489
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,700
they gave me a lot of food.

490
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,375
You came back here

491
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,900
because you wanted to see them again?

492
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,975
I missed them a lot.

493
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,975
If they see the flare,

494
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,100
they may come.

495
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Give us your money!

496
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,020
A lot of people here.

497
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,200
- They're the stupid bandits?
- Take out your money.

498
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,780
Take it out.

499
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,700
- Not them.
- Give us your money.

500
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,825
- It's weird.
- Take it out.

501
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,525
This is supposed to be their territory.

502
00:28:34,525 --> 00:28:35,275
Boss.

503
00:28:35,275 --> 00:28:35,975
- Your Highness.
- Today,

504
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,740
- I'm experienced in the martial world.
- we'll get a lot.

505
00:28:37,825 --> 00:28:38,725
Judged by my experience...

506
00:28:38,725 --> 00:28:39,425
We'll be too busy.

507
00:28:39,425 --> 00:28:41,300
...there are two conditions

508
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,500
where former bandits have been replaced.

509
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,000
How dare you chat!

510
00:28:44,375 --> 00:28:45,820
- You totally ignore me?
- Yeah.

511
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,550
Yeah.

512
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,220
Take out your money!

513
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,550
- Take it out!
- Take it out!

514
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:50,980
Girls come here!

515
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:52,200
First,

516
00:28:52,225 --> 00:28:53,750
- the former bandits were expelled.
- As for men,

517
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,140
- What about the second?
- we'll kill them all.

518
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,025
They were all killed by new bandits.

519
00:28:57,025 --> 00:28:58,140
As for girls,

520
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,700
we'll enjoy them all.

521
00:29:01,225 --> 00:29:03,875
Holding a dagger, girl?

522
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,300
Sirs,

523
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,425
if I give this beautiful girl to you,

524
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,780
will you let us go?

525
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,525
We're dying, anyway.

526
00:29:21,825 --> 00:29:22,940
May I ask you a question?

527
00:29:23,725 --> 00:29:25,060
Where's Old Meng?

528
00:29:25,475 --> 00:29:26,875
Cut the crap.

529
00:29:27,075 --> 00:29:28,650
I'll kill you first.

530
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:30,740
Shu Xiu.

531
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,575
Your Highness.

532
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:35,375
Don't let anyone of them run away.

533
00:29:36,925 --> 00:29:38,400
Try harder to fight me.

534
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,550
Fight her!

535
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,175
- Yes.
- Yes.

536
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:51,260
Don't rush to leave.

537
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,600
Come in and talk.

538
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,460
Spare me.

539
00:29:58,175 --> 00:29:59,535
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

540
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,100
Please spare my life.

541
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,150
How long have you been
in Mount Qingcheng?

542
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,500
For more than a month.

543
00:30:06,025 --> 00:30:07,450
In such a short time,

544
00:30:07,975 --> 00:30:09,600
you haven't built your own camp,
have you?

545
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,800
The former bandits left the camp.

546
00:30:17,275 --> 00:30:18,380
You killed them?

547
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,300
No, no.

548
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,975
But I know

549
00:30:22,475 --> 00:30:23,340
they were in trouble.

550
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,380
Trouble?

551
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,025
What trouble?

552
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:28,940
Immortals of Qingyang Sect

553
00:30:29,075 --> 00:30:31,020
took away a teenage girl.

554
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,925
Old Meng and his men

555
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,540
went to Qingyang Sect,
asking for the girl.

556
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:35,725
In the end,

557
00:30:36,825 --> 00:30:37,900
none of them came back.

558
00:30:40,175 --> 00:30:41,300
Xiaoque'er?

559
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:44,980
Why did they take her?

560
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,020
I heard immortals of Qingyang Sect

561
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,860
get stronger by hurting girls.

562
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:50,340
Maybe they just wanted that girl.

563
00:30:53,475 --> 00:30:54,800
When was the girl taken away?

564
00:30:55,175 --> 00:30:56,500
Before we came here.

565
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,980
Less than two months ago.

566
00:31:01,475 --> 00:31:02,580
What else would you like to ask?

567
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,580
I've confessed everything.

568
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:07,525
How many people have you killed?

569
00:31:07,525 --> 00:31:08,575
None.

570
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,125
We're poor men.

571
00:31:10,775 --> 00:31:13,300
We didn't have a choice,
but to be bandits.

572
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:22,150
Grandpa Wei.

573
00:31:24,025 --> 00:31:24,600
Here.

574
00:31:24,875 --> 00:31:26,400
There's a slope a bit further south.

575
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,925
The camp is behind it.

576
00:31:27,925 --> 00:31:29,300
Please go and check it for me.

577
00:31:29,825 --> 00:31:30,525
All right.

578
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:37,750
Watch them carefully.

579
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,940
Don't worry, Your Highness.

580
00:31:39,075 --> 00:31:40,175
None of them can run away.

581
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,125
Where are you going, Your Highness?

582
00:31:46,225 --> 00:31:47,100
I'm going for walk.

583
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,000
I'll go with you.

584
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,140
This is

585
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,375
Yin-yang Pavilion.

586
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,925
It's said to be
the boundary of Mount Qingcheng.

587
00:32:12,675 --> 00:32:14,060
It's the real world
at the foot of the mountain.

588
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:16,225
On the mountain,

589
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:17,180
it's the nether world.

590
00:32:19,425 --> 00:32:21,900
It's hard to distinguish them, isn't it?

591
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,025
Yeah.

592
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,180
It's always hard to distinguish them

593
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,250
and it's hard to judge people.

594
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:47,950
Give me the writing brush and paper.

595
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:56,860
Keep still.

596
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,260
Your Highness,

597
00:33:27,775 --> 00:33:28,900
it's quite dark.

598
00:33:29,075 --> 00:33:29,940
How do you manage

599
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,075
to see the mountain so clearly?

600
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:36,200
I came to this pavilion before.

601
00:33:37,225 --> 00:33:38,180
I've kept

602
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:39,580
the scenery in my mind.

603
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,375
Where are you going?

604
00:34:05,475 --> 00:34:07,075
I've drunk too much water.

605
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,100
I'm afraid of the dark.

606
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,900
I need her to go with me.

607
00:34:18,575 --> 00:34:19,350
Go.

608
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,175
What again?

609
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,820
When few people are around,

610
00:34:29,925 --> 00:34:31,050
we can sneak away.

611
00:34:31,575 --> 00:34:33,150
We've got nowhere to go.

612
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:33,700
Come on.

613
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,900
Don't waste time talking.

614
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,420
Go with me, anyway.

615
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:37,580
I'll take the cat with us.

616
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:08,875
Your Highness.

617
00:35:09,225 --> 00:35:10,550
How did you find us?

618
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,450
I saw the flare

619
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:13,660
and I came to have a look.

620
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,300
How's the camp?

621
00:35:16,425 --> 00:35:17,600
Many women were locked there.

622
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,850
They were kidnapped.

623
00:35:19,225 --> 00:35:20,725
Their families were ruined.

624
00:35:21,875 --> 00:35:23,250
Don't they want to take revenge?

625
00:35:23,425 --> 00:35:24,075
They do.

626
00:35:24,575 --> 00:35:25,460
But they're scared.

627
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:27,750
In the end,

628
00:35:28,075 --> 00:35:29,025
they all left.

629
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,620
Will we send the bandits

630
00:35:32,675 --> 00:35:33,860
to the government?

631
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,600
We're just kidding.

632
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,925
We're not running away.

633
00:35:50,175 --> 00:35:50,780
We just...

634
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,020
Xu Xiao only asked me
to protect Xu Fengnian.

635
00:35:53,975 --> 00:35:54,860
I don't interfere

636
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:57,175
with anyone else.

637
00:36:11,275 --> 00:36:12,220
Off you go.

638
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:13,580
I won't stop you.

639
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:20,980
Let's go.

640
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,580
Quickly.

641
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:24,625
Don't bother.

642
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
North Liang

643
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,620
isn't far from here.

644
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,450
If I run away,

645
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,125
a message will be sent back
by a carrier pigeon.

646
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,700
You should at least try.

647
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,375
There isn't a chance.

648
00:36:38,925 --> 00:36:40,450
Why do we bother?

649
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,575
Mm.

650
00:36:43,675 --> 00:36:44,325
I...

651
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,000
I don't think you want to leave.

652
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,875
You can hear us?

653
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,725
I can whenever I want.

654
00:37:13,225 --> 00:37:14,450
What do you think, girl?

655
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,525
Would you like
to learn martial arts from me?

656
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,780
With martial arts,

657
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,625
you can decide

658
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:21,775
whether you stay or leave.

659
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,650
I refuse.

660
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,575
According to His Highness,

661
00:37:43,225 --> 00:37:44,875
the women are scared
after they've been hurt.

662
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,600
But it doesn't matter.

663
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,150
We'll take revenge

664
00:37:48,675 --> 00:37:49,575
for them.

665
00:37:52,825 --> 00:37:54,025
What does that mean?

666
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:56,820
The women in the camp...

667
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,625
You can't believe them.

668
00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:59,100
They're cheap women!

669
00:38:01,825 --> 00:38:03,220
We've got a lot of treasure.

670
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,375
I can give it to you,

671
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,700
as long as you let me go.

672
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:09,975
Dig holes.

673
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,324
(Villager Xiaoque'er)

674
00:38:37,775 --> 00:38:39,175
Why can't I blow out a sound?

675
00:38:39,475 --> 00:38:40,375
Let me teach you.

676
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:41,950
Oh.

677
00:38:42,325 --> 00:38:43,420
Xu,

678
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:46,050
I knew you would leave.

679
00:38:48,475 --> 00:38:49,860
I won't leave until I teach you.

680
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,575
All right?

681
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:51,450
Well,

682
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:53,400
come back and visit me later.

683
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,475
I will.

684
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,600
It's wise of you, Your Highness.

685
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,875
You've kept in mind the landform?

686
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,940
I shouldn't waste my trip.

687
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,775
They were killed.

688
00:39:25,775 --> 00:39:27,350
Shu Xiu and Lyu Qiantang

689
00:39:27,825 --> 00:39:28,740
buried them.

690
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,025
Mm.

691
00:39:33,575 --> 00:39:35,175
What would you like to say?

692
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:36,400
Your Highness,

693
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,900
why didn't we send them
to the government?

694
00:39:41,825 --> 00:39:43,125
The government may not kill

695
00:39:43,525 --> 00:39:44,940
the criminals I give them.

696
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,600
The court always defends

697
00:39:47,775 --> 00:39:49,100
the enemies of North Liang.

698
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,275
And of course,

699
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:52,180
they're mere bandits.

700
00:39:52,275 --> 00:39:53,300
They're of little importance.

701
00:39:53,675 --> 00:39:55,350
But just in case.

702
00:39:55,775 --> 00:39:57,620
They've killed so many people.

703
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,820
I don't want them
to have any chance to stay alive.

704
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:02,675
Those bandits

705
00:40:03,775 --> 00:40:05,175
deserve to be killed.

706
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,075
Not all bandits are so cruel.

707
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:10,375
When Old Meng was here,

708
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,940
he never killed people.

709
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:14,020
When he met poor men during the robbery,

710
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,400
he even gave them money.

711
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,660
He robbed Old Huang and me
when we didn't even have a single penny.

712
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,700
When we left,

713
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,300
he gave us a lot of money, instead.

714
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:24,660
He and his men were righteous bandits.

715
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,740
They weren't bandits.

716
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:29,620
They were just villagers
who couldn't make a living.

717
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:31,740
There were even the old and weak,
women and children among them.

718
00:40:32,425 --> 00:40:33,660
There was a little girl,

719
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:35,460
named Xiaoque'er.

720
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:39,180
She kept asking me to teach her
to blow the leaves.

721
00:40:40,475 --> 00:40:42,460
She often stole jerky
from Old Meng for me.

722
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,140
The girl

723
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,075
who was taken to Qingyang Sect?

724
00:40:51,975 --> 00:40:53,475
Wu Lingsu of Qingyang Sect

725
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,340
was bestowed Lord of Qingcheng

726
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,100
by the late emperor.

727
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,750
He established Shenxiao Sect.

728
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,340
It's a sect in the martial world

729
00:41:00,575 --> 00:41:01,980
as well as the spy for the royal family.

730
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,740
Mount Qingcheng is the first pass

731
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,150
outside North Liang.

732
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:06,740
Actually,

733
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,275
Wu Lingsu is spying

734
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:10,300
on North Liang in the dark.

735
00:41:10,975 --> 00:41:11,940
I know.

736
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:14,700
I had planned

737
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:16,700
to avoid Qingyang Sect

738
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,350
when I had to pass Mount Qingcheng.

739
00:41:21,075 --> 00:41:22,350
You did it right, Your Highness.

740
00:41:22,725 --> 00:41:23,500
At present,

741
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,725
we're fighting for the inheritance
of the throne of North Liang.

742
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,025
We can't have a dispute with Wu Lingsu.

743
00:41:30,025 --> 00:41:31,580
I promised Xiaoque'er

744
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,025
that I would come back for her.

745
00:41:35,675 --> 00:41:37,325
She's been caught for two months.

746
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,050
It's too late now.

747
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,340
Yeah.

748
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:51,740
It's too late.

749
00:41:54,675 --> 00:41:55,700
I can't save her.

750
00:41:58,475 --> 00:41:59,550
Put it away.

751
00:42:11,575 --> 00:42:13,460
To make a big difference,
one must be patient

752
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,650
and weigh up the pros and cons.

753
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,775
It's too late to save her, anyway.

754
00:42:18,475 --> 00:42:19,400
I can

755
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:22,850
avenge her later.

756
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,575
But what if she's still alive?

757
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,020
Your Highness,

758
00:42:43,375 --> 00:42:44,600
you should focus on our big plan.

759
00:42:47,225 --> 00:42:47,975
Grandpa Wei,

760
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:49,780
I'm afraid I can't
make a big difference.

761
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,075
I'm going to break
into Mount Qingcheng.
