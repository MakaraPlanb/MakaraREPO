1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

5
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
=Sword Snow Stride=
(Season 1)

6
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,400
=Episode 22=

7
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,620
Where's Xu Fengnian?

8
00:01:53,925 --> 00:01:54,740
Senior,

9
00:01:55,275 --> 00:01:56,650
please keep an eye on them.

10
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,475
Why are you still going out
when badly wounded?

11
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:00,625
I have to go.

12
00:02:16,425 --> 00:02:17,300
Uncle.

13
00:02:21,925 --> 00:02:23,275
Where are your Buddha beads?

14
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,580
Not wearing it?

15
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,150
Are they all subordinates you have now?

16
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,380
May I have a word with you, Uncle?

17
00:02:40,225 --> 00:02:40,940
Follow up.

18
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,200
Let me go with you, Your Highness.

19
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,275
Stay here.

20
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,460
I'll have a private talk with him.

21
00:03:06,975 --> 00:03:08,620
Wang Mingyin died?

22
00:03:09,675 --> 00:03:11,780
No.11 Swordsman is true to his name.

23
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,180
Luckily, I have Li Chungang

24
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,380
who could do Snakes in Sleeves.

25
00:03:18,475 --> 00:03:19,860
He's still alive?

26
00:03:20,525 --> 00:03:22,400
He's in my carriage.

27
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,700
Then why did you still come with me?

28
00:03:27,425 --> 00:03:28,580
Why didn't I?

29
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:32,220
If you stayed around Li Chungang,

30
00:03:32,675 --> 00:03:34,900
you might stay alive.

31
00:03:36,075 --> 00:03:37,740
You don't want to kill me.

32
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,140
What should I worry about?

33
00:03:41,475 --> 00:03:42,600
If I don't want to kill you,

34
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,640
why did I invite No.11 Swordsman?

35
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,020
If you wanted to kill me,

36
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,450
you could have used your army.

37
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,225
Why did you bother
to invite a swordsman?

38
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,140
Then why do you think

39
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,075
I asked Wang Mingyin

40
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,875
to kill you?

41
00:04:04,575 --> 00:04:06,550
You arranged the assassination
in the reeds

42
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,875
to put up a show for someone.

43
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:11,980
Who do you mean?

44
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,980
Someone in the capital.

45
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,060
The royal family.

46
00:04:15,575 --> 00:04:17,060
North Liang is hard to control.

47
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,695
There's also a huge army in Qingzhou.

48
00:04:20,475 --> 00:04:21,700
They're both vassal towns.

49
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,180
If you didn't assassinate me,

50
00:04:24,675 --> 00:04:27,400
you couldn't reassure the royal family.

51
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,660
So, you also know

52
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,540
Qingzhou and North Liang
are bound to be enemies.

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,780
It's just the trend of times.

54
00:04:39,775 --> 00:04:42,100
The problem could have been
easily solved.

55
00:04:43,225 --> 00:04:44,980
As long as you gave Wang Linquan to me,

56
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,660
you could have left Qingzhou.

57
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,060
But now,

58
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,540
there's no turning back
for neither you nor me.

59
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:53,620
It's Xu Xiao's plan.

60
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,860
I don't like it.

61
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,140
So, I'll find a way out by myself.

62
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,775
Do you mean

63
00:04:58,775 --> 00:05:00,140
flirting with my wife?

64
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,300
In Xiangfan

65
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,800
and even the entire Qingzhou,

66
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,100
everybody knows

67
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,580
that you love

68
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,340
your wife Pei Nanwei most.

69
00:05:14,475 --> 00:05:16,060
Everyone in Qingzhou knows

70
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,700
Lord of Jing'an treats
Consort Pei Nanwei

71
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,725
as a treasure.

72
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,100
Zhao Xun, son of Lord of Jing'an,

73
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,525
once was obsessed with Pei Nanwei.

74
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:22,450
Later,

75
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,450
Lord of Jing'an married her.

76
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,300
After they got married,

77
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,700
His Lordship loved her a lot.

78
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,300
Not only in Xiangfan,

79
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,420
but also throughout Qingzhou,

80
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,420
everyone knows

81
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,725
Lord of Jing'an loves his wife most.

82
00:05:35,925 --> 00:05:37,025
But I...

83
00:05:37,025 --> 00:05:38,740
I've been thinking about something.

84
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,820
What kind of man are you?

85
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,060
When lords were fighting for the throne,

86
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,100
you were the most scheming one.

87
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:51,340
Your own clique didn't show up

88
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,780
until the last minute.

89
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,260
You were just unlucky

90
00:05:55,475 --> 00:05:57,380
so that you failed.

91
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:03,140
It was a long time ago.

92
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,450
What's the point of bringing it up?

93
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,980
Why would such a scheming man like you

94
00:06:08,725 --> 00:06:10,975
let everybody in Qingzhou

95
00:06:11,175 --> 00:06:12,780
know your Achilles' heel?

96
00:06:14,175 --> 00:06:16,460
If you really loved Pei Nanwei,

97
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,620
you would only keep her in your mansion

98
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,220
and let no one know about her.

99
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:26,220
Don't you know who I am?

100
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,100
Back off!

101
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,900
Lord of Jing'an is quite generous.

102
00:06:29,575 --> 00:06:31,700
He'll even let his wife die with us.

103
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,900
A man with an Achilles' heel

104
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,645
will reassure others.

105
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,420
However,

106
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,350
if we only focus on that,

107
00:06:43,075 --> 00:06:45,555
we'll ignore the real danger.

108
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,475
Pei Nanwei is my Achilles' heel?

109
00:06:50,925 --> 00:06:53,580
You make people think
she's your Achilles' heel.

110
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,780
She's the scapegoat only.

111
00:06:56,825 --> 00:06:59,050
We're talking about
whether I'll kill you.

112
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,900
Aren't you getting off the subject?

113
00:07:01,825 --> 00:07:03,660
The Achilles' heel you gave me

114
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,820
is the chance of my survival.

115
00:07:07,975 --> 00:07:09,860
You know it very well.

116
00:07:09,975 --> 00:07:12,460
This is the only good reason

117
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,500
for letting me leave Qingzhou.

118
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:15,980
Also,

119
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,540
it won't make the court suspect you.

120
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,900
See the nephew off.

121
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,420
When I saw your message,

122
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,980
I explained to Pei Nanwei

123
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,140
that there were two meanings

124
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,580
of the four words.

125
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,540
Two meanings?

126
00:07:34,825 --> 00:07:36,340
The first one is easy to understand.

127
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,340
Off means down,

128
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,750
namely the hell.

129
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,425
He wants to kill me.

130
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,650
The first meaning

131
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,980
is for people in the world.

132
00:07:50,075 --> 00:07:51,740
As I flirted with your wife,

133
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,395
you wanted to kill me.

134
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,550
What about the second meaning?

135
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,020
The second meaning...

136
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,780
You're giving me a present.

137
00:08:03,225 --> 00:08:04,980
The present will accompany me

138
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,220
and see me off.

139
00:08:07,975 --> 00:08:09,375
What's the present?

140
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,850
Pei Nanwei, of course.

141
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,820
I'm giving my wife to you?

142
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,075
This is the best reason

143
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:19,300
for not killing me.

144
00:08:21,075 --> 00:08:22,860
I'm lecherous and absurd.

145
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,180
And I'm daring.

146
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,060
I not only flirted with your wife,

147
00:08:26,225 --> 00:08:27,705
but also kidnapped her.

148
00:08:28,025 --> 00:08:28,900
In the end,

149
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,300
I'll threaten you

150
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,750
with her life.

151
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,350
You don't have a choice,

152
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,540
but to let me leave Qingzhou.

153
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,900
What's better,

154
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,420
after you let me leave,

155
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,300
the court won't worry

156
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,425
that you may ally with us secretly.

157
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,620
After all, we're not going to make up

158
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,900
because I've taken away your wife.

159
00:08:48,225 --> 00:08:49,650
If I

160
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,420
really wanted to let you go,

161
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,100
why did I arrange

162
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,140
the assassination in the reeds?

163
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:00,900
If you didn't,

164
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:02,860
the court wouldn't be relieved.

165
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:06,500
It's a fake assassination?

166
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,580
It's not.

167
00:09:10,275 --> 00:09:11,900
If I died,

168
00:09:12,675 --> 00:09:13,900
it would only mean

169
00:09:14,175 --> 00:09:16,420
I wasn't qualified to be your ally.

170
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,740
Ally?

171
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:20,580
Under cover of the feud,

172
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,420
Qingzhou and North Liang

173
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,620
may help each other

174
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,540
in the future.

175
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,220
The premise is

176
00:09:30,575 --> 00:09:32,735
that you become the Lord of North Liang.

177
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,100
Don't you want to try

178
00:09:40,575 --> 00:09:42,500
fighting for the throne again?

179
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,900
Xu Xiao...

180
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,220
...has a good son.

181
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,260
I saw what you did.

182
00:10:27,825 --> 00:10:29,660
We both want to kill Xu Fengnian.

183
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,000
We can

184
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:32,340
join hands.

185
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,675
The gold is all mine.

186
00:10:35,075 --> 00:10:35,750
Get lost.

187
00:10:36,225 --> 00:10:37,125
Otherwise,

188
00:10:37,425 --> 00:10:38,350
I'll kill you.

189
00:11:05,725 --> 00:11:06,520
Go away.

190
00:11:07,825 --> 00:11:08,860
All right then.

191
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,100
I'm going away.

192
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,354
Go.

193
00:11:56,525 --> 00:11:57,850
Where's His Highness?

194
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,900
I got the Book of Blade

195
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,875
from Wudi City.

196
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:13,940
Now that you use blades,

197
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,405
it will be helpful.

198
00:12:16,775 --> 00:12:18,100
What's in the wooden box?

199
00:12:19,225 --> 00:12:22,180
Half of Mumaniu.

200
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,180
Li Chungang's sword?

201
00:12:24,725 --> 00:12:25,565
Exactly.

202
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,660
It was broken by Wang Xianzhi.

203
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:31,060
But a broken sword

204
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,700
can still be of great use

205
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,180
in the hands of God of Sword.

206
00:12:35,025 --> 00:12:36,340
You prepared it in advance.

207
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,620
Did you know
Li Chungang would travel with me?

208
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,860
I knew he was around you

209
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,100
so that I asked No.11 swordsman
to assassinate you without concern.

210
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,900
The assassination had to be real.

211
00:12:51,275 --> 00:12:54,115
But I couldn't really kill you.

212
00:12:54,825 --> 00:12:57,380
Otherwise, your crazy father

213
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,300
would certainly start a war against me.

214
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,980
I believe in Buddhism.

215
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:09,175
But I don't want to die for that.

216
00:13:15,825 --> 00:13:16,980
Off you go.

217
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,860
One last question.

218
00:13:19,575 --> 00:13:21,260
Did you spend a thousand taels of gold

219
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,860
hiring a girl to kill me?

220
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,180
I did.

221
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,260
Miss Hehe is an assassin you've trained?

222
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,460
You've asked too many questions.

223
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,780
The last piece of advice for you.

224
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,140
Don't take Pei Nanwei to Wudi City.

225
00:13:42,525 --> 00:13:43,940
She's fishy.

226
00:13:44,175 --> 00:13:45,300
I suspected

227
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,140
that she approached my son deliberately.

228
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,260
That's why

229
00:13:48,825 --> 00:13:51,020
I married her first!

230
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,180
He left?

231
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,675
Yes.

232
00:14:40,425 --> 00:14:41,725
And he left you to me.

233
00:14:45,325 --> 00:14:46,825
Don't you want to ask

234
00:14:47,475 --> 00:14:49,220
what I'm going to do with you?

235
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,430
I have one question.

236
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,020
Speak.

237
00:14:56,225 --> 00:14:57,820
You had Wang Linquan sent away

238
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,620
and invited me to the reeds,

239
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,980
because you knew
there would be an assassination?

240
00:15:03,675 --> 00:15:04,980
I did know that.

241
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,740
You let the Wang Family live.

242
00:15:08,225 --> 00:15:10,545
But you had Fengzi Battalion
take the risk for you.

243
00:15:12,025 --> 00:15:13,140
These soldiers

244
00:15:13,575 --> 00:15:15,135
died for you.

245
00:15:19,475 --> 00:15:20,580
Xu Fengnian,

246
00:15:21,075 --> 00:15:23,140
you're quite hypocritical.

247
00:15:23,525 --> 00:15:24,500
Shut up!

248
00:15:32,675 --> 00:15:33,820
It's different.

249
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,700
What makes it different?

250
00:15:37,525 --> 00:15:39,900
A hundred soldiers of Fengzi Battalion
left North Liang with me.

251
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,220
We met Fujiang Armor in the rain.

252
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,540
Forty-five of them died.

253
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,860
In the boat fight on Chunshen Lake,

254
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,660
another two soldiers died.

255
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,780
After today's battle,

256
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,860
less than ten soldiers

257
00:16:00,725 --> 00:16:02,020
are still alive.

258
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,125
Those who died in battles

259
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,780
are from North Liang

260
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,625
just like the Wang Family.

261
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,020
But they have different identities.

262
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,500
The Wang Family

263
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,140
are ordinary people.

264
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,300
Those in Fengzi Battalion

265
00:16:22,075 --> 00:16:23,340
are soldiers!

266
00:16:24,425 --> 00:16:25,940
A soldier's duty

267
00:16:26,175 --> 00:16:28,260
is to protect ordinary people

268
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,660
like the Wang Family

269
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:32,980
with his blood and weapon!

270
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,100
I've kept in mind

271
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,075
those who died.

272
00:16:40,925 --> 00:16:42,340
I feel sad.

273
00:16:44,925 --> 00:16:46,460
But if I were given a second chance,

274
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,000
I would make the same choice!

275
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,175
Because I couldn't escape.

276
00:16:51,275 --> 00:16:52,740
I wouldn't escape, either.

277
00:16:54,925 --> 00:16:55,980
From first to last,

278
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,875
I've been fighting with them

279
00:16:59,575 --> 00:17:00,940
shoulder by shoulder

280
00:17:01,775 --> 00:17:03,260
and confronting the moment of death!

281
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,180
Your Highness, it's our honor

282
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,100
to fight shoulder by shoulder with you.

283
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,175
Your Highness.

284
00:17:45,025 --> 00:17:46,300
Qingniao hasn't woken up yet?

285
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,825
She's in the other carriage.
Someone's taking care of her.

286
00:17:50,225 --> 00:17:51,740
Luckily, I completed the conversation.

287
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,400
If Lord of Jing'an realized
I was badly wounded,

288
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,180
he might not let me leave safely.

289
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,000
You've made a good deal.

290
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,250
You planned

291
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,460
to kidnap Consort of Jing'an long ago.

292
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,900
If Lord of Jing'an
didn't give me a chance,

293
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,660
he wouldn't ask Pei Nanwei

294
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,020
to bring a message to the weeds.

295
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,780
We just understood each other.

296
00:18:10,025 --> 00:18:12,380
You and that old fox
understood each other?

297
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,725
You're birds of a feather.

298
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,940
He's an old fox.

299
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,400
But I'm a young phoenix.

300
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,820
You're both beasts, anyway.

301
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,780
You're getting more sharp-tongued.

302
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:21,660
Speaking of beasts,

303
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,420
I think of something.

304
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,300
What is it?

305
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,220
Do you remember I saw a dead Hukui

306
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,580
on Mount Qingcheng?

307
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,100
I got lost in the woods

308
00:18:30,225 --> 00:18:32,660
and saw someone rush past,
riding on a giant beast.

309
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,260
I wonder what killed Hukui.

310
00:18:35,425 --> 00:18:36,540
I saw that.

311
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,000
It rushed past me.

312
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,075
What did it look like?

313
00:18:39,675 --> 00:18:42,075
It was so fast
that I didn't see it clearly.

314
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,600
It was black and white,

315
00:18:44,725 --> 00:18:47,060
carrying a girl on its back.

316
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:50,250
When I think of it now,

317
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,930
the girl was like that assassin
when looked from behind.

318
00:18:53,025 --> 00:18:55,650
Are you saying Miss Hehe killed Hukui?

319
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,980
Then she followed us
as early as we were on Mount Qingcheng?

320
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,540
It doesn't make sense.

321
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,260
We didn't arrive in Qingzhou
at that time.

322
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,380
Does she want to kill me

323
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,020
not simply for the gold
from Lord of Jing'an?

324
00:19:07,425 --> 00:19:08,820
She lied to you.

325
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,540
Did she want to kill me

326
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,620
even when she sold braised beef
in Lingzhou?

327
00:19:14,025 --> 00:19:15,060
It doesn't make sense, either.

328
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,060
She could have assassinated me
many times these years.

329
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,500
Why bother waiting until now?

330
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:18,525
Come on.

331
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:19,900
What's your relationship

332
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,425
with Miss Hehe?

333
00:19:21,425 --> 00:19:23,500
I met her several times
when I did some beef shopping.

334
00:19:23,975 --> 00:19:25,180
I didn't even know her name.

335
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,580
Because she kept smiling,

336
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,860
I named her Miss Hehe.

337
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,020
Also,

338
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,260
Lord Jing'an reminded me.

339
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,900
Pei Nanwei can't go with us.

340
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,425
Care about yourself, first.

341
00:19:33,525 --> 00:19:34,700
Why?

342
00:19:34,725 --> 00:19:36,525
Your eyes are bleeding.

343
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,860
Bleeding from all the seven openings
of my head?

344
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,620
I've heard about it.

345
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,140
Unexpectedly,

346
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,260
I could experience it by myself.

347
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,650
If you keep experiencing it, you'll die.

348
00:20:00,275 --> 00:20:01,300
Senior,

349
00:20:02,575 --> 00:20:04,500
you mentioned the way
to destroy my pubic region.

350
00:20:05,275 --> 00:20:06,540
But is there an alternative?

351
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,175
Yes.

352
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,500
Please instruct me.

353
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,180
Digest the genuine spirit

354
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,660
and you can live with a new body.

355
00:20:14,925 --> 00:20:15,925
A new body?

356
00:20:15,925 --> 00:20:16,675
Mm.

357
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,860
Hidden in your body,

358
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,700
Dahuangting goes into your passages
as time goes by.

359
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,940
It's a stable process,
but it dissipates quickly, too.

360
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,820
If it goes on like this,

361
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,000
you'll digest 30% at most.

362
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,825
But that girl badly wounded you

363
00:20:28,825 --> 00:20:29,940
and you've got a disorder in your body.

364
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,940
If you can take the chance

365
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,140
to digest Dahuangting forcibly,

366
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,580
you can absorb 50% at least

367
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,300
after you make it.

368
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,400
In this way,

369
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,225
you're kind of getting a new body.

370
00:20:40,725 --> 00:20:42,350
You mean I can survive

371
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,180
and even get more power?

372
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:43,860
No, no, no.

373
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,975
When you digest it forcibly,

374
00:20:44,975 --> 00:20:46,860
you'll be rising from the dead.

375
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,800
The breakthrough in passages
will be like thousands of cuts.

376
00:20:49,025 --> 00:20:51,325
How long can you bear the pain?

377
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,475
How long do I have to bear it?

378
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,740
I'm not sure.

379
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,780
In every moment of the process,

380
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,200
you'll feel like you're skinned.

381
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,100
Once you start it, you can't stop.

382
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,780
If you give up,

383
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,600
your passages will break
and you're dead.

384
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:05,900
It's unbearable

385
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,350
for humans.

386
00:21:07,675 --> 00:21:08,540
I want to give it a try.

387
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,060
You're the son of Lord of North Liang.

388
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,260
You're already influential.

389
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,550
Even if you can't do martial arts,

390
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,225
you don't need to take the risk!

391
00:21:14,425 --> 00:21:15,860
Old Huang died
when he challenged Wang Xianzhi.

392
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:16,900
One day,

393
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,200
I'll fight Wang Xianzhi for him.

394
00:21:18,775 --> 00:21:20,400
Only for Jian Jiuhuang?

395
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,780
I don't know

396
00:21:26,425 --> 00:21:27,660
who killed my mother.

397
00:21:28,775 --> 00:21:29,740
In the future,

398
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,620
I'll avenge her by myself.

399
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:34,940
You've made up your mind?

400
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,140
Yes.

401
00:21:38,025 --> 00:21:39,540
You made the choice yourself.

402
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,580
Don't blame me if you die.

403
00:21:40,825 --> 00:21:41,820
I won't blame you.

404
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,860
I ask for that.

405
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,980
Don't you try to stop him?

406
00:21:45,925 --> 00:21:47,500
If I were him,
I would make the same choice.

407
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,950
All right, then.

408
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:51,300
Take off your clothes.

409
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,950
Sit comfortably.

410
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,875
Man, stay still.

411
00:21:57,325 --> 00:21:59,900
I'm going to transmit the genuine spirit
into your passages.

412
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,175
You have to bear it alone after that.

413
00:22:03,325 --> 00:22:04,500
Thank you, senior.

414
00:22:06,275 --> 00:22:07,125
Come on.

415
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,700
This is just the beginning.

416
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,925
Bear it.

417
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:57,675
Stop the carriage!

418
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:15,140
Senior.

419
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,100
You can't help him.

420
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:18,660
He has to bear

421
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,140
the cutting pain.

422
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,340
It's better than death, anyway.

423
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,180
If you die, you can do nothing.

424
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,140
Why isn't there a sound anymore?

425
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,390
He's been suffering
for such a long time.

426
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:06,625
I guess he's too exhausted to yell

427
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,000
or move.

428
00:24:08,825 --> 00:24:10,150
It's been a couple of hours.

429
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,380
How long must he bear it?

430
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,675
It depends on him.

431
00:24:13,275 --> 00:24:14,380
What if he can't make it?

432
00:24:15,775 --> 00:24:17,325
He'll die, then.

433
00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:18,125
Ah?

434
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:22,460
Senior,

435
00:24:23,825 --> 00:24:25,250
if His Highness dies,

436
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,580
guards like us

437
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,740
will be dead, too.

438
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:30,875
Please save his life.

439
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:34,900
I can't.

440
00:24:40,425 --> 00:24:42,150
I don't think
His Highness can bear it anymore.

441
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,740
He has been living a comfortable life.

442
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,325
How can he bear such torture?

443
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:47,620
In this case,

444
00:24:49,275 --> 00:24:50,540
we'd better consider it for ourselves.

445
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:52,550
What's your point?

446
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,950
I worked for North Liang,

447
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,780
because I wanted a shelter

448
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,980
and I wanted to ask His Lordship

449
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,450
for White Emperor
Esoterica of Simplicity.

450
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,780
However,

451
00:25:04,575 --> 00:25:06,380
I never want to die.

452
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,975
You're leaving?

453
00:25:10,825 --> 00:25:12,225
After His Highness dies,

454
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,750
who knows
how His Lordship will punish us?

455
00:25:17,075 --> 00:25:18,100
If I leave now,

456
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,820
I may survive.

457
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,625
A deserter will be beheaded.

458
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,140
I'm a guard,

459
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,500
not a soldier.

460
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,140
General Ning,

461
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,940
let her go.

462
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,575
Xu Fengnian can't make it.

463
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,580
I kindly advise you

464
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:45,460
to think about the consequence, too.

465
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:01,000
This is awkward.

466
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:04,620
If only you could leave a bit later!

467
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,975
Please punish me, Your Highness.

468
00:26:15,475 --> 00:26:16,850
I thought you would run away.

469
00:26:17,425 --> 00:26:18,740
Now that you're alive,

470
00:26:19,325 --> 00:26:20,460
I'll get more benefits

471
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,820
if I stay.

472
00:26:24,075 --> 00:26:25,060
You may rise.

473
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,175
Your Highness,

474
00:26:27,525 --> 00:26:28,800
we can't keep a girl like her.

475
00:26:29,725 --> 00:26:32,250
I'll give you
White Emperor Esoterica of Simplicity.

476
00:26:35,525 --> 00:26:37,460
I pledge my life to you, Your Highness.

477
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,780
That's not true.

478
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:43,220
We both know

479
00:26:43,775 --> 00:26:45,025
that you don't want to die.

480
00:26:45,725 --> 00:26:46,780
But it doesn't matter.

481
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:48,420
Not all my subordinates

482
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,220
have to die for me.

483
00:26:51,175 --> 00:26:52,300
North Liang is big.

484
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,525
There's space for a mere girl.

485
00:26:55,225 --> 00:26:57,100
You're as generous as Xu Xiao.

486
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,820
North Liang will prosper.

487
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,475
Is there a stream or pool nearby?

488
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,540
There's blood on my clothes.

489
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,550
It's the invulnerable Kylin Armor?

490
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,300
Invulnerable?

491
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,900
Miss Hehe cut it

492
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,350
with only one stroke.

493
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,175
She has strange martial arts.

494
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:57,180
Without the Armor,

495
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,375
you would have been dead.

496
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,150
Unfortunately, there isn't
a second Kylin Armor.

497
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,625
You no longer need it, anyway.

498
00:28:03,225 --> 00:28:04,620
What level is your Dahuangting now?

499
00:28:05,575 --> 00:28:07,350
According to the rule of Wudang,

500
00:28:07,425 --> 00:28:08,425
it's the fourth level.

501
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,675
How lucky you are!

502
00:28:10,675 --> 00:28:13,060
Even Wang Chonglou has
sixth-level Dahuangting only.

503
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,275
Are you saying

504
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,820
I have to be grateful to Miss Hehe?

505
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,625
Letting her kill you
will be the best token of gratitude.

506
00:28:18,825 --> 00:28:19,500
Senior.

507
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,175
Mm?

508
00:28:20,175 --> 00:28:21,875
Am I a master now?

509
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,325
Not at all.

510
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,400
But you have great tenacity.

511
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:27,825
Do you mind

512
00:28:27,975 --> 00:28:29,675
teaching me some super swordplay?

513
00:28:30,225 --> 00:28:31,980
You use blades.
Why do you want to learn swordplay?

514
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,260
I can do both.

515
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:34,775
It's greedy of you.

516
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,140
This is the swordplay
of Snakes in Sleeves.

517
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,315
If you can't master it
before arriving in Wudi City,

518
00:29:04,315 --> 00:29:05,775
you're not destined to have it.

519
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:10,550
You're teaching me Snakes in Sleeves?

520
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,875
Whatever.

521
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,575
You may not master it.

522
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:17,540
What are you looking at?

523
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,500
Didn't Lord of Jing'an
return your sword to you?

524
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,900
Why are you still
using the wooden sword?

525
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,260
I threw it away.

526
00:29:24,525 --> 00:29:25,300
You did?

527
00:29:25,425 --> 00:29:26,380
Why?

528
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,740
Why do I need a broken sword?

529
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,875
But that's a famous sword.

530
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:30,800
Don't you mind?

531
00:29:30,925 --> 00:29:32,100
Powerful as I am,

532
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,580
even I use a blunt sword
from a blacksmith's shop,

533
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,660
I'll still be God of Sword.

534
00:29:35,075 --> 00:29:36,525
How powerful are you?

535
00:29:37,975 --> 00:29:39,650
Without me,

536
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,980
swordsmanship would be in the dark!

537
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,000
You're quite boasting.

538
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,860
Few people can do that.

539
00:29:55,525 --> 00:29:56,700
I'm modest enough.

540
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,600
We've had enough rest.

541
00:30:01,025 --> 00:30:01,950
Time to leave.

542
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:02,850
Mm.

543
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,000
By the way, senior,

544
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,775
have you thought

545
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:08,400
about getting married?

546
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,860
What do you think of Pei Nanwei?

547
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:15,275
Are you out of your mind?

548
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,420
Seriously,

549
00:30:17,925 --> 00:30:19,225
Pei Nanwei

550
00:30:19,675 --> 00:30:21,860
is a hot potato.

551
00:30:21,925 --> 00:30:24,220
Even Lord of Jing'an thinks she's fishy.

552
00:30:24,475 --> 00:30:25,980
If we travel with her,

553
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:28,100
there'll be a lot of trouble.

554
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,220
But we can't send her back to Xiangfan.

555
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,180
If you can marry her,

556
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,550
you'll keep her under control.

557
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,525
Get lost!

558
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,125
Grandpa Wei.

559
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:40,940
Your Highness.

560
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,650
Senior.

561
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,180
Qingzhou Cavalry

562
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,300
has caught up.

563
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,460
It doesn't make sense.

564
00:30:46,025 --> 00:30:47,300
If Lord of Jing'an wanted to kill me,

565
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,375
he needn't have waited until now.

566
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:49,780
It's...

567
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,400
Young Master Zhao Xun.

568
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,860
He came for Consort of Jing'an.

569
00:30:54,475 --> 00:30:55,460
See?

570
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,380
Here comes the trouble.

571
00:31:04,725 --> 00:31:05,940
Give her to me

572
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,300
and I'll let you leave.

573
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,620
Here we meet again.

574
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,500
The wound on your face...

575
00:31:10,575 --> 00:31:11,700
Has it recovered?

576
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,500
Give her to me.

577
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,425
Who?

578
00:31:15,225 --> 00:31:16,660
You kidnapped Consort of Jing'an.

579
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,075
You're quite ignoring us.

580
00:31:19,975 --> 00:31:21,260
How dare you come to stop me

581
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,700
with only so few soldiers!

582
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,140
Your father isn't aware, is he?

583
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,220
This is the struggle
between Qingzhou and North Liang.

584
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,300
Martial artists shouldn't interfere.

585
00:31:33,675 --> 00:31:34,675
You're scared?

586
00:31:36,425 --> 00:31:37,620
I ask for a battle assignment.

587
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,900
I would like to capture him,

588
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,175
for your disposal, Your Highness.

589
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,300
How about this?

590
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,500
Let me ask her.

591
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,325
If she wants to go with you,

592
00:31:45,325 --> 00:31:46,460
I'll let her go.

593
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,500
You heard us.

594
00:31:52,975 --> 00:31:54,875
Do you want to go back
to Xiangfan with Zhao Xun?

595
00:32:01,525 --> 00:32:02,325
See?

596
00:32:02,325 --> 00:32:03,260
She doesn't want to leave.

597
00:32:03,325 --> 00:32:04,220
How's that possible?

598
00:32:04,225 --> 00:32:05,540
You must have threatened her.

599
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,860
Stop saying "her".

600
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:08,975
She's your stepmother.

601
00:32:10,975 --> 00:32:12,225
Get ready to fight.

602
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:15,340
Your Highness,

603
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,460
I'm sorry.

604
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,100
I'd like to accept any punishment!

605
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,300
I'm sorry that you've suffered!

606
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:25,740
Your Highness.

607
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,775
Your Highness.

608
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:27,900
I'm late.

609
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,625
Your Highness.

610
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:29,260
Your Highness,

611
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,780
let me check on you.

612
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:32,050
Have you been hurt?

613
00:32:32,675 --> 00:32:33,780
Have you barked your skin?

614
00:32:37,975 --> 00:32:40,060
The monster Chu Lushan has come.

615
00:32:41,275 --> 00:32:42,600
Li Chungang is around, too.

616
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:45,940
How can I kill my brother-in-law?

617
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,775
Isn't it too hard?

618
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:51,200
Fengzi Battalion neglected their duty

619
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,175
and made you hurt.

620
00:32:53,175 --> 00:32:54,060
That's enough.

621
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,400
Stand up. Stand up.

622
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,475
Your Highness,

623
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:04,675
who's he?

624
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,060
Son of Lord of Jing'an.

625
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,100
He came to fight me.

626
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,340
Good, then.

627
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,660
Chu Lushan,

628
00:33:14,275 --> 00:33:16,020
you're a general of sub-third rank.

629
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,875
How dare you leave North Liang
with your army?

630
00:33:18,425 --> 00:33:20,050
He's so nagging.

631
00:33:20,275 --> 00:33:21,325
Shall I kill him?

632
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:24,020
He's the son of Lord of Jing'an.

633
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,460
We don't have a reason to kill him.

634
00:33:25,725 --> 00:33:27,300
It's not a problem.

635
00:33:27,975 --> 00:33:29,140
Let's kill them all.

636
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,300
Then let's set a fire

637
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,800
and burn their bodies.

638
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,900
Do you hear him?

639
00:33:34,475 --> 00:33:36,200
It's not too late to leave now.

640
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,420
When the fight starts,

641
00:33:37,425 --> 00:33:38,740
I can't stop him.

642
00:33:39,075 --> 00:33:39,780
Your Highness,

643
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,500
Chu Lushan is famous
for his ruthlessness.

644
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,020
If we fight directly,

645
00:33:43,075 --> 00:33:44,220
I'm afraid we can't defeat them.

646
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:52,150
I'll take revenge
for what happened today!

647
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,575
I dare you to point
at His Highness again!

648
00:34:03,225 --> 00:34:04,025
Let's go back to Xiangfan.

649
00:34:04,025 --> 00:34:04,900
Wait a minute.

650
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:07,425
Don't push it.

651
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:08,900
Give the blade back to me.

652
00:34:24,325 --> 00:34:25,020
Go.

653
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,575
It's benevolent of you, Your Highness.

654
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,460
In my opinion,

655
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,575
we should just kill such guys.

656
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,860
Why did you come?

657
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,980
Godfather sent me.

658
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,100
Xu Xiao?

659
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:49,720
Yeah.

660
00:34:50,025 --> 00:34:51,180
Isn't he in the capital?

661
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:53,860
He asked me to lead my cavalry

662
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,200
to Qingzhou for you when I received

663
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,620
the sword tassel sent by a hawk.

664
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,550
What hawk?

665
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,650
I don't know.

666
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,700
I just saw the hawk that day

667
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,675
and then I set out.

668
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,700
Luckily, I arrived in time

669
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,925
and didn't let them hurt you.

670
00:35:04,925 --> 00:35:05,725
Wait.

671
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,275
Why did Xu Xiao send you to Qingzhou?

672
00:35:08,725 --> 00:35:09,660
He didn't tell me the reason.

673
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,750
He simply asked me
to take orders from you.

674
00:35:13,175 --> 00:35:14,260
Shall I

675
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,325
go to Wudi City with you?

676
00:35:16,325 --> 00:35:17,025
Ridiculous.

677
00:35:17,725 --> 00:35:19,800
What do you think I should do, then?

678
00:35:22,975 --> 00:35:23,875
Go back to North Liang.

679
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:24,875
Ah?

680
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:26,860
I came all the way here.

681
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,100
But you want me to return?

682
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,300
How about this?

683
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,825
Let them go back

684
00:35:33,825 --> 00:35:35,025
and let me stay.

685
00:35:35,025 --> 00:35:36,460
You're a general of sub-third rank.

686
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,940
Qingzhou is the farthest you can reach.

687
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,100
If you keep following me,
what will the royal family think?

688
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,540
I'll quit my job, then.

689
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,200
Nonsense.

690
00:35:41,525 --> 00:35:42,625
Just go away.

691
00:35:43,075 --> 00:35:44,400
Your Highness.

692
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,225
Shut up.

693
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,725
I came all the way...

694
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:00,380
Wait.

695
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,075
Mm?

696
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,425
Speaking of it,

697
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,550
I've got a mission for you.

698
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,250
This is Consort of Jing'an?

699
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,420
She's indeed beautiful.

700
00:36:16,225 --> 00:36:17,380
Escort the two ladies

701
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,500
back to North Liang.

702
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:21,125
If you want to entrust me to Chu Lushan,

703
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:22,350
I would rather die.

704
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,900
Look what a bad reputation you have.

705
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,875
Don't worry, Your Grace.

706
00:36:26,325 --> 00:36:28,450
I've done all kinds of evil things.

707
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:29,540
But there's an exception.

708
00:36:29,725 --> 00:36:31,060
I never touch anyone

709
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,300
entrusted by His Highness.

710
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,050
Send Qingniao back to my mansion

711
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,220
for a good recuperation.

712
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,025
As for Consort of Jing'an...

713
00:36:37,425 --> 00:36:39,060
She has a special status

714
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,380
and can't be kept in my mansion.

715
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,475
Shall I find a house

716
00:36:43,475 --> 00:36:45,125
and hide her in Yanzhi County?

717
00:36:47,225 --> 00:36:48,460
Sounds feasible.

718
00:36:48,725 --> 00:36:49,660
But you must keep it secret.

719
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,100
I understand.

720
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,060
I'll keep her there
without telling anyone.

721
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,500
When you're back,
you can have a good time with her.

722
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,340
What are you talking about?

723
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,625
She's my aunt, speaking of seniority.

724
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:02,425
That's why I'll keep it secret.

725
00:37:02,425 --> 00:37:03,600
Don't talk nonsense.

726
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,150
Just keep an eye on her.

727
00:37:05,525 --> 00:37:06,300
Aye, Your Highness.

728
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,275
I know you're keeping a secret.

729
00:37:10,275 --> 00:37:11,850
After I'm back in North Liang,

730
00:37:12,475 --> 00:37:13,620
I'll ask you.

731
00:37:14,975 --> 00:37:15,925
Your Highness.

732
00:37:16,675 --> 00:37:17,660
You're awake?

733
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,675
I'm not going back.

734
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:23,250
But you're wounded.

735
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:26,020
I want to travel with you.

736
00:37:37,425 --> 00:37:39,100
Chu Lushan will not go with Xu Fengnian.

737
00:37:42,725 --> 00:37:43,820
Master?

738
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:50,450
Are you going
to kill Xu Fengnian personally?

739
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:54,220
I can't show myself.

740
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,340
But if you don't go,

741
00:37:56,675 --> 00:37:59,220
who else can kill Xu Fengnian
when Li Chungang is around?

742
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:02,020
Even if I tried,

743
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:04,460
I might not defeat Li Chungang, either.

744
00:38:04,775 --> 00:38:05,650
Ah?

745
00:38:09,025 --> 00:38:10,540
What do we do, then?

746
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:13,740
Among five Fujiang Armors,

747
00:38:14,275 --> 00:38:15,660
only the Gold Armor is available.

748
00:38:19,075 --> 00:38:20,550
Go to Mount Longhu.

749
00:38:22,475 --> 00:38:23,500
Mount Longhu?

750
00:38:23,925 --> 00:38:25,380
For Four Longhu Arch-Taoists?

751
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:27,940
Go find the Fisherman

752
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:30,475
by the Bottomless Pool
deep behind the mountain.

753
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:32,750
If we want to fight Li Chungang,

754
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,100
we have to depend on the Fisherman.

755
00:38:36,875 --> 00:38:39,060
Is the Fisherman

756
00:38:40,825 --> 00:38:42,260
a great master in isolation?

757
00:38:44,925 --> 00:38:46,225
But without a reason,

758
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,780
why would he

759
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,460
help me to kill Xu Fengnian?

760
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,980
He's Zhao Huangchao.

761
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,950
He's also from the royal family.

762
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,860
Royal family?

763
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,580
The Xu Family is the biggest obstacle
of the royal family.

764
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,660
If you convince him with this reason,

765
00:39:10,225 --> 00:39:12,020
he will help you, I guess.

766
00:39:18,325 --> 00:39:19,820
After Xu Fengnian is killed,

767
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,820
I have to aggravate
the situation personally

768
00:39:24,725 --> 00:39:27,180
so that Xu Xiao will rebel
and leave the capital.

769
00:39:27,275 --> 00:39:28,850
When the world is in chaos,

770
00:39:29,675 --> 00:39:33,000
you'll have a chance
to take over the throne.

771
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,100
Thank you, Master,

772
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,540
for racking your brains.

773
00:39:44,525 --> 00:39:45,800
No plan can be activated

774
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,820
until Xu Fengnian is killed.

775
00:39:52,475 --> 00:39:53,540
I understand.

776
00:39:54,175 --> 00:39:55,500
My brother-in-law

777
00:39:57,075 --> 00:39:58,340
has to be killed.

778
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:03,625
Please take good care of yourself.

779
00:40:04,475 --> 00:40:05,420
On your way,

780
00:40:05,975 --> 00:40:07,780
if anyone dares to be rude to you,

781
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,750
keep that in mind.

782
00:40:09,175 --> 00:40:11,200
Later, I'll kill them all.

783
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,575
How dare you stay that!

784
00:40:13,825 --> 00:40:15,600
You're no longer scared
of military laws?

785
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,250
You're more important
than military laws.

786
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,175
Go take care of another thing.

787
00:40:22,075 --> 00:40:24,125
Wang Linquan and his family
have returned to North Liang.

788
00:40:25,175 --> 00:40:26,340
Look after them for me.

789
00:40:26,525 --> 00:40:27,660
Don't let them feel aggrieved.

790
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,150
Don't worry, Your Highness.

791
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,220
Lyu Qiantang died in the reeds.

792
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:39,140
Here are his cremains.

793
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,275
Take them back to North Liang, too.

794
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,375
Find out
where the Lin Family settled down.

795
00:40:47,825 --> 00:40:49,450
Before his death, he said

796
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,260
that he wanted his cremains
to be cast into the river.

797
00:40:53,925 --> 00:40:56,060
But I believe he wants to go home.

798
00:40:57,025 --> 00:40:58,380
Take him back home.

799
00:40:59,925 --> 00:41:01,325
Count on me.

800
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,400
Take care, Your Highness!

801
00:41:27,775 --> 00:41:29,000
How far has Yu Youwei gone?

802
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,375
Not far ahead of us.

803
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,525
Let's go and meet her

804
00:41:32,525 --> 00:41:33,725
before we keep going east.

805
00:41:33,975 --> 00:41:34,580
Yes.

806
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,140
Look at you.

807
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:48,500
I was just dizzy.

808
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,860
I feel much better after some sleep.

809
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:11,000
Your Highness,

810
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:12,700
I can still drive the carriage.

811
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,700
Don't talk nonsense.

812
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,825
Sit here for recuperation.

813
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,350
Where are we going?

814
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:22,200
Jiangnan.
[*Jiangnan: south of the Yangtze River]

815
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:23,500
I'm going to see my eldest sister.

816
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:27,150
Chu Lushan was sent by Xu Xiao, right?

817
00:42:28,375 --> 00:42:29,075
Yes.

818
00:42:29,975 --> 00:42:31,820
He came right in time.

819
00:42:34,075 --> 00:42:36,060
I thought I didn't choose the way
Xu Xiao arranged for me.

820
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:37,875
But in the end,

821
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:39,300
I've been doing everything

822
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,600
in the way he expected.

823
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,600
He's your father, after all.

824
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,450
No one else in this world
knows more about you than him.

825
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:46,025
He has arranged the future for you.

826
00:42:46,075 --> 00:42:47,475
You can't get away.

827
00:42:49,225 --> 00:42:49,900
