(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

(Biography of Wu Su)

8
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:05,900
Your Highness.

9
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:09,850
Your Highness.

10
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,075
Your Highness.

11
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,950
Are you all right?

12
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:23,675
Yes.

13
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,580
I was just a bit dizzy.

14
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:28,450
Oh.

15
00:02:29,225 --> 00:02:30,940
What do you think
this picture indicates?

16
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:33,600
This picture

17
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,725
has nothing to do

18
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,380
with the text content.

19
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,925
When you look at this picture,

20
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,180
do you have any special feelings?

21
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,675
It's just a normal picture.

22
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,300
Never mind.

23
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,060
Let's continue.

24
00:03:06,475 --> 00:03:07,980
It's you again!

25
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,525
Is it you

26
00:03:21,775 --> 00:03:22,740
who gave him the wooden box?

27
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,820
If I reply,

28
00:03:24,475 --> 00:03:25,660
will you let me climb up?

29
00:03:26,225 --> 00:03:27,340
You want to climb up

30
00:03:28,525 --> 00:03:29,340
and kill him?

31
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,100
Or why would I take the trouble?

32
00:03:32,525 --> 00:03:33,180
No way.

33
00:03:33,925 --> 00:03:35,340
Too many people in Yangcheng
would notice me

34
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,500
so I didn't want to fight you there.

35
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,420
But things are different here.

36
00:03:39,525 --> 00:03:41,000
I advise you one last time.

37
00:03:42,225 --> 00:03:43,950
We can join hands

38
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,020
to kill Xu Fengnian.

39
00:03:46,175 --> 00:03:47,225
Oh.

40
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:49,525
Mm.

41
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:52,580
But I don't want that.

42
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,140
Miss,

43
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,750
you should

44
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,425
at least be reasonable!

45
00:04:09,775 --> 00:04:10,925
In this biography,

46
00:04:10,925 --> 00:04:13,025
many testimonies from witnesses
have been collected.

47
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,540
That night,

48
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,420
Wang Xianzhi was indeed in the capital.

49
00:04:18,775 --> 00:04:19,875
Not all testimonies

50
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,940
are true.

51
00:04:22,975 --> 00:04:24,060
Witnesses mentioned in it

52
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,125
are mostly alive.

53
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:27,100
It's not hard to confirm.

54
00:04:28,275 --> 00:04:29,225
I think

55
00:04:29,675 --> 00:04:31,140
the testimonies are true.

56
00:04:32,225 --> 00:04:34,425
Even if Wang Xianzhi was
in the capital that night,

57
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,500
he might not be the assassin.

58
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,540
Honestly,

59
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,225
Her Grace

60
00:04:40,225 --> 00:04:41,825
had excellent swordsmanship.

61
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,375
But if Wang Xianzhi fought her,

62
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,700
she wouldn't have left
the capital alive.

63
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,100
It at least proves
that Wang Xianzhi was involved.

64
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:53,250
I guess this is why

65
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,500
the wooden box
was suddenly given to you.

66
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,380
I understand.

67
00:04:57,175 --> 00:04:58,950
I'm going to Wudi City.

68
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,175
When I see this and get disturbed,

69
00:05:01,475 --> 00:05:03,400
I'll fight Wang Xianzhi directly.

70
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,075
Then, the trick to get me killed
by Wang Xianzhi

71
00:05:05,075 --> 00:05:06,020
will be achieved.

72
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,300
Your Highness.

73
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,125
I'm glad you understand that.

74
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,050
(Biography of Wu Su)

75
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,675
But this is a clue, anyway.

76
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,875
Over the years,

77
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,575
the truth is finally beginning
to come out.

78
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,600
I protected Huangman'er

79
00:05:28,025 --> 00:05:29,625
and my sisters

80
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,200
because I promised my mother

81
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,260
that I would defend our family for her.

82
00:05:36,475 --> 00:05:38,475
My mother is still in my heart.

83
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,325
She's watching me.

84
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,025
I won't let her down.

85
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,700
I'll find out who murdered her.

86
00:05:47,775 --> 00:05:48,925
Your Highness.

87
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,375
I'm all right.

88
00:05:53,775 --> 00:05:54,700
I'm just...

89
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,900
I'm just a bit disturbed

90
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:59,000
when I've found a clue
after all the trouble.

91
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,340
Don't worry, Grandpa Wei.

92
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,220
I won't do silly things

93
00:06:03,475 --> 00:06:04,450
or act on impulse.

94
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,900
Leave me alone for a while.

95
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,980
I'll think about the whole story.

96
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,575
If you need anything,

97
00:06:13,975 --> 00:06:15,260
let me know.

98
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:15,900
I will.

I stay by the steam of Mount Longhu.)

106

107
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,260
Mother!

Fengnian.

109
00:12:35,225 --> 00:12:36,260
Those who cross Heaven's Gate

110
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,675
can override all mortals.

111
00:12:37,675 --> 00:12:38,875
But I'm not convinced.

112
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,020
I'm not convinced
that destiny controls life,

113
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,025
that we can't fight against fate,

114
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,540
that man can't conquer nature,

115
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,420
or that the Unity can be immortal.

116
00:12:47,575 --> 00:12:48,940
I can use my sword

117
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,200
to break open the Heaven's Gate.

118
00:12:50,675 --> 00:12:52,950
Even if demons and immortals
come to the mortal world,

119
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,940
I'll kill them with my sword!

120
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,225
I can cut off the destiny

121
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,500
and remove the shackles.

122
00:12:58,425 --> 00:12:59,700
With the unyielding spirit,

123
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,750
I can cut off all the hesitation

124
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,850
and fear in my heart.

125
00:13:12,475 --> 00:13:15,550
Go away, destiny!

126
00:13:24,775 --> 00:13:26,420
I have a blade,

127
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,660
to kill the dragon!

128
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,875
I have a blade,

129
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,075
to kill the Unity!

130
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,550

00:16:30,475 --> 00:16:31,800
So, it's a dream?

134
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,125
You didn't expect to see me, did you?

135
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:44,660
Hey.

136
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,400
Time to yell for help.

137
00:16:47,675 --> 00:16:48,750
You're wounded?

138
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,180
I fought with someone by the cliff.

139
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,300
Not a big problem.

140
00:16:56,325 --> 00:16:57,475
Were there a lot of people

141
00:16:58,275 --> 00:16:59,140
by the cliff?

142
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,175
Mm.

143
00:17:00,225 --> 00:17:00,975
A lot of them.

144
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,575
They all came to kill you.

145
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,000
You're sought after.

146
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,150
Where's the man who hurt you?

147
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:08,460
Off the cliff.

148
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,300
Running into an insane girl
is the biggest trouble.

149
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,875
Hope Mr. Zhao Huangchao's plan
will work.

150
00:18:01,325 --> 00:18:02,375
The day is breaking.

151
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,925
The fight last night was in vain.

152
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:10,975
Go.

153
00:18:11,775 --> 00:18:12,825
Let's go for breakfast.

154
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,820
Don't you yell for help yet?

155
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,260
I'm really going to kill you.

156
00:18:25,025 --> 00:18:26,420
The sun is coming out.

157
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,525
In a little while,

158
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:38,340
the sunrise will be spectacular.

159
00:18:47,775 --> 00:18:49,540
Shall we enjoy the scenery

160
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,375
before the fight?

161
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:55,825
Why not?

162
00:19:05,675 --> 00:19:06,975
It's indeed spectacular.

163
00:19:22,025 --> 00:19:23,180
Why are you crying?

164
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,300
I dreamed of my mother.

165
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:32,825
She...

166
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,675
She's gorgeous, isn't she?

167
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,300
You're handsome.

168
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,980
Your mother must be beautiful.

169
00:19:47,725 --> 00:19:49,075
Over the years,

170
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,140
I don't want to believe

171
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,060
that she's dead.

172
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,725
I always think

173
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,225
that she's living in my heart.

174
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,300
Actually, I'm deceiving myself.

175
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,340
What makes you say that?

176
00:20:17,725 --> 00:20:19,750
She bade farewell to me in my dream.

177
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,625
She died.

178
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,900
A long time ago.

179
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,825
I just didn't accept the truth

180
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:34,600
until now.

181
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:37,925
Did you bid farewell to her

182
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,660
in your dream?

183
00:20:41,725 --> 00:20:42,980
It was too late.

184
00:20:53,775 --> 00:20:55,275
The scenery is beautiful today.

185
00:20:55,775 --> 00:20:57,275
For its sake,

186
00:20:57,525 --> 00:20:58,460
I'm not going to kill you.

187
00:21:01,575 --> 00:21:03,220
Why do you insist on killing me?

188
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,620
I don't believe you do that
for the gold only.

189
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,060
See you.

190
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:17,820
It's not too late.

191
00:21:20,325 --> 00:21:21,300
Excuse me?

192
00:21:21,725 --> 00:21:22,780
Farewell.

193
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:24,380
As long as you bid farewell to her,

194
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,350
she will hear you.

195
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:41,825
Mother,

196
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,300
farewell.

197
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,060
(Biography of Wu Su)
This is the dragon

198
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,100
(Biography of Wu Su)
you saw in your dream.

199
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,780
Did some patterns

200
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:58,940
and a picture

201
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,460
get me into a dream?

202
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,780
They only worked on you.

203
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,180
The one who prepared this

204
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,820
must have known you very well.

205
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:05,675
Did he do this

206
00:22:05,675 --> 00:22:07,740
only to make His Highness
have a nightmare?

207
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,140
He wanted to use the nightmare

208
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,220
to ruin the dependence and reliance

209
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,075
in your heart.

210
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:15,300
I guess in your heart,
your mother is the most important.

211
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:16,650
Right.

212
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,700
He wanted to attack you spiritually

213
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,100
so that you would break down
and become desperate.

214
00:22:20,225 --> 00:22:21,650
How did you get over it?

215
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,325
I destroyed them in my dream.

216
00:22:25,525 --> 00:22:26,825
If you hadn't taught me

217
00:22:26,825 --> 00:22:28,260
Open the Heaven's Gate,

218
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,050
I wouldn't have managed to do that.

219
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,820
Not everybody can make it.

220
00:22:34,275 --> 00:22:35,400
Now that you've got over it,

221
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,100
no tricks of this kind

222
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,700
can influence you anymore.

223
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,380
But who do you think

224
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,700
sent this to us?

225
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,340
No matter who sent it,

226
00:22:49,075 --> 00:22:50,140
he'll come again.

227
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,675
Let's set out.

228
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,450
To Mount Longhu!

229
00:23:08,175 --> 00:23:09,875
His Majesty summoned you to the palace.

230
00:23:13,575 --> 00:23:16,075
His Majesty summoned you to the palace.

231
00:23:18,225 --> 00:23:19,550
Let me sleep for a bit longer.

232
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:21,925
Why did His Majesty

233
00:23:22,225 --> 00:23:24,540
summon me at this time of day?

234
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,875
An urgent message came from Yangzhou

235
00:23:26,175 --> 00:23:29,850
that your son met Cao Changqing
in Yangcheng.

236
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,050
One of the top three martial artists?

237
00:23:34,225 --> 00:23:37,140
Your son's maid
is the princess of West Chu.

238
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,525
You know that, don't you?

239
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,450
I do.

240
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:42,460
Then why do you keep her
in your mansion?

241
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,975
When the princess

242
00:23:43,975 --> 00:23:45,100
serves as a maid,

243
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,580
it's the pride of North Liang.

244
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,800
Cao Changqing

245
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,620
recognized the princess

246
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,825
and fought your son!

247
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,600
Li Chungang was around him, wasn't he?

248
00:23:57,775 --> 00:24:00,780
Li Chungang and Cao Changqing

249
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,180
had a fight, but neither of them won.

250
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,740
Before Cao Changqing left, he said

251
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,780
that he would go back to West Shu.

252
00:24:07,025 --> 00:24:08,740
Your son's maid

253
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,420
would be the queen.

254
00:24:12,725 --> 00:24:15,380
When the queen serves as his maid,

255
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,050
he'll be imposing.

256
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:19,380
Imposing?

257
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,340
Evidence shows

258
00:24:22,525 --> 00:24:23,940
that Jiang Ni

259
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,060
has been trying to kill Xu Fengnian
since she was little.

260
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:27,900
Looks like

261
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,020
she hates him a lot.

262
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,180
My son

263
00:24:31,475 --> 00:24:33,450
will be stuck in romance tricks.

264
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,580
Girls all hate him.

265
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,725
Do you get it?

266
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:41,340
The new queen of West Chu
wants to kill Xu Fengnian.

267
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,420
At last, I can

268
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,140
have a sound sleep.

269
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,220
Seriously?

270
00:24:47,825 --> 00:24:48,750
Xu Xiao!

271
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,700
Ouch.

272
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,400
Don't yell.

273
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,140
Come on.

274
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,420
Lie down with me.

275
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,100
Come on.

276
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:06,925
The wind is rising.

277
00:25:08,725 --> 00:25:09,580
Any problem?

278
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,780
Jiang Ni?

279
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,780
Keep your voice down.

280
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,575
Cao Changqing made the wind rise?

281
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,250
I asked him to cover me

282
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,700
so that I could sneak back.

283
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,660
I thought Cao Changqing would stop you
from coming back.

284
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,100
When you're in danger,

285
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,220
Cao Changqing won't help to save you

286
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,940
unless Jiang Ni is around you.

287
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,700
Do you get it?

288
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,375
I came back to ask you for money.

289
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,340
I've served as your maid
for so many years.

290
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,700
When I have to leave,

291
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,500
shouldn't you give me some allowance?

292
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,260
When you're really leaving,

293
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:00,260
I'll give it to you.

294
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:02,975
I've promised Mr. Chess Master

295
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:05,025
that after you leave
Mount Longhu safely,

296
00:26:05,175 --> 00:26:07,025
I'm going to West Shu.

297
00:26:07,675 --> 00:26:08,600
Anyway,

298
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,550
he also said

299
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,540
that our residence in West Shu

300
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,900
would be a good thing for North Liang.

301
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:16,075
I would rather that you stayed.

302
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:29,275
So that you could order me about?

303
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,325
All right.

304
00:26:35,325 --> 00:26:36,500
You should be careful.

305
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,620
Except those who you trust,

306
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,660
don't let anyone know

307
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,500
that I'm back.

308
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,525
Mm.

309
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:43,980
What about Yu Youwei?

310
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,725
She's staying with Mr. Chess Master.

311
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,250
He said

312
00:26:47,775 --> 00:26:49,900
he would tell her

313
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,375
about all supporters of West Chu.

314
00:26:51,825 --> 00:26:54,125
She'll be my lady-in-waiting.

315
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:58,940
Her Grace isn't noticed, is she?

316
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:01,625
What if I kill Xu Fengnian?

317
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,540
Without a reason,

318
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,925
why must you kill Xu Fengnian?

319
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:07,000
When Her Grace has her way to go,

320
00:27:07,825 --> 00:27:09,700
she can't be stuck in love affairs.

321
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,075
Only a loner

322
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:13,900
can establish the monarchy.

323
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:16,625
Nonsense.

324
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,450
I made a slip of the tongue.

325
00:27:22,525 --> 00:27:23,675
I didn't mean that.

326
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:25,175
I get it.

327
00:27:26,975 --> 00:27:28,550
I won't kill Xu Fengnian, then.

328
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,875
When Li Chungang is around,

329
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,180
I can't kill Xu Fengnian, anyway.

330
00:27:41,975 --> 00:27:42,900
Xu Xiao?

331
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,700
When His Majesty has summoned you,

332
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,940
there'll be a result

333
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,450
for your son's inheritance problem.

334
00:27:49,675 --> 00:27:51,780
But you're ignoring His Majesty.

335
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,350
What...?

336
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:54,275
What do you want?

337
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,100
I don't want to do anything.

338
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,700
He's kept me here for so many days
without seeing me.

339
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,540
Why can't I keep him waiting, too?

340
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,660
It's not time to be angry
with His Majesty.

341
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,820
Why don't you understand?

342
00:28:09,925 --> 00:28:12,020
The more arrogant I pretend to be,

343
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,340
the more relieved His Majesty will feel.

344
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,525
All right. All right.

345
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,220
You always make sense.

346
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:20,300
If you still don't go,

347
00:28:20,425 --> 00:28:21,620
the carriages from the palace

348
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,575
will block the gate.

349
00:28:25,975 --> 00:28:26,575
What?

350
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:29,740
Why are you lying down again?

351
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:30,740
You're right.

352
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,850
I shouldn't push it.

353
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,380
Let's go to the palace.

354
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,220
Oh, yes.

355
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,275
That's great.

356
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,380
Be patient.

357
00:28:41,475 --> 00:28:42,980
You were tricked

358
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:43,980
and caught in a nightmare?

359
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,140
Who did that?

360
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:46,475
This is what confuses me.

361
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,100
I can't figure out
who's capable enough to trick me.

362
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,340
Why are you staring at me?

363
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,420
He's an idiot.

364
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,150
And he isn't experienced
in the martial world.

365
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:57,260
It makes sense
that he can't recognize martial tricks.

366
00:28:57,425 --> 00:28:58,140
But what about you?

367
00:28:58,525 --> 00:28:59,500
You're the God of Sword.

368
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,500
You have no idea, too?

369
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,125
I...

370
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,540
I've been hiding under Tingchao Pavilion

371
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,740
for so many years.

372
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,420
How do I know

373
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,900
what masters have appeared

374
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,850
in the martial world in recent years?

375
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,900
I'll go ask Mr. Chess Master later.

376
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,260
What about the female assassin?

377
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,660
Why didn't she kill you at that time?

378
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,700
I don't think

379
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:14,600
she wanted to kill me.

380
00:29:16,025 --> 00:29:17,340
Let's think about it.

381
00:29:17,825 --> 00:29:19,000
Did she hurt me twice

382
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:20,420
just to kill me?

383
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,660
After she assassinated me
for the first time,

384
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,580
I rose from the dead.

385
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:24,075
I absorbed the genuine spirit forcibly

386
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,620
and enhanced Dahuangting
to the fourth level.

387
00:29:25,925 --> 00:29:26,925
And then,

388
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,325
she assassinated me in Yangcheng.

389
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:29,780
As the saying goes,

390
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,860
fortune and misfortune are intertwined.

391
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,860
Your wound

392
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,750
would be helpful, anyway.

393
00:29:33,925 --> 00:29:35,460
When I killed Liu Liting in Yangcheng,

394
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,700
I could have caused problems.

395
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:38,500
But her assassination

396
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,820
caught the Lu Family in a dilemma.

397
00:29:40,025 --> 00:29:41,020
Just because I was wounded,

398
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,540
the crisis was defused.

399
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:44,000
Two assassinations

400
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:45,660
were helpful to me.

401
00:29:45,775 --> 00:29:47,500
So, you think she's been helping you?

402
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,660
Before today's sunrise,

403
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,100
she had the best chance to kill me.

404
00:29:50,975 --> 00:29:52,100
But she didn't.

405
00:29:52,575 --> 00:29:53,725
Could it be

406
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,580
another arrangement of Xu Xiao's?

407
00:29:55,725 --> 00:29:56,775
I don't know.

408
00:29:57,725 --> 00:29:59,175
As I'm going east,

409
00:29:59,825 --> 00:30:00,660
I feel

410
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,380
that I just can't see through Xu Xiao.

411
00:30:02,822 --> 00:30:05,600
(The Imperial Study
of the Imperial Palace of Liyang)

412
00:30:18,675 --> 00:30:21,325
You came early, Prime Minister Zhang.

413
00:30:34,275 --> 00:30:34,900
Mm?

414
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,925
Who else is coming?

415
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:45,175
His Majesty also summoned
General Gu Jiantang.

416
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,300
Unfortunately,

417
00:30:47,575 --> 00:30:49,540
he's having a recurrence of the wound.

418
00:30:49,975 --> 00:30:50,750
Today,

419
00:30:51,175 --> 00:30:52,340
he can't come.

420
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,180
Of course, a coward like him

421
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,420
doesn't dare to come and see me.

422
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,460
During the national wars,

423
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,100
there were four famous generals.

424
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,900
Gu Jiantang is as famous as you.

425
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:07,250
After Liyang ruled the world,

426
00:31:08,025 --> 00:31:09,140
you settled

427
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,380
in North Liang

428
00:31:10,525 --> 00:31:12,020
and became the lord.

429
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,675
Gu Jiantang, however,

430
00:31:13,675 --> 00:31:15,020
abandoned his troops

431
00:31:15,325 --> 00:31:16,660
and came to the capital alone.

432
00:31:16,825 --> 00:31:18,325
For national affairs,

433
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,025
he has been straining every nerve.

434
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,300
Our people

435
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,400
will judge

436
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,475
who is loyal and who is treacherous.

437
00:31:26,475 --> 00:31:27,540
Without doubt,

438
00:31:27,675 --> 00:31:28,780
a sinister man

439
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,020
like Gu Jiantang

440
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,700
is the most loyal.

441
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,940
So,

442
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:35,100
maybe he can be

443
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,460
the best candidate

444
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,500
to take over North Liang.

445
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:51,260
If he takes over North Liang,

446
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,600
will His Majesty

447
00:31:54,675 --> 00:31:55,750
feel relieved?

448
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:58,940
Don't gossip about His Majesty.

449
00:31:59,125 --> 00:31:59,825
Oh.

450
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,250
I'll say no more.

451
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,300
Where's His Majesty?

452
00:32:03,675 --> 00:32:04,660
He summoned me.

453
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,420
Why hasn't he appeared yet?

454
00:32:05,525 --> 00:32:07,125
His Majesty is feeling unwell

455
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,800
and he won't see you.

456
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,950
Then why did he summon me?

457
00:32:16,125 --> 00:32:17,425
Here's an oral instruction.

458
00:32:18,775 --> 00:32:20,200
His Majesty wants to ask you a question.

459
00:32:20,425 --> 00:32:22,180
If your son takes over North Liang

460
00:32:22,225 --> 00:32:24,780
and inherits the throne of North Liang,

461
00:32:24,925 --> 00:32:27,820
do you still want to be Grand Commander?

462
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:37,225
When doing business,

463
00:32:37,975 --> 00:32:39,025
people gain some and lose some.

464
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,820
I understand.

465
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:42,400
What do you understand?

466
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:47,900
I'm too old and muddleheaded

467
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,420
to take such an important post.

468
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,300
Tomorrow, I'll submit a report

469
00:32:51,875 --> 00:32:54,300
to resign as Grand Commander.

470
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,180
Good.

471
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,820
According to His Majesty,

472
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:02,500
you don't need to kneel for this.

473
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:26,325
Now that you resign as Grand Commander,

474
00:33:26,325 --> 00:33:27,500
the throne of North Liang

475
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,525
should be inherited by your son.

476
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,550
The North Liang Army

477
00:33:32,425 --> 00:33:33,820
will still belong to the Xu Family.

478
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:42,025
(Xu Fengnian is permitted to inherit
the hereditary throne of North Liang...)

479
00:33:51,675 --> 00:33:53,300
This is a national affair.

480
00:33:53,975 --> 00:33:56,025
Do you really take it
as a business deal?

481
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,375
Don't be angry, Prime Minister.

482
00:33:58,575 --> 00:33:59,850
His Majesty said

483
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,860
that North Mang cast covetous eyes on us

484
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,900
and the people of West Chu
wanted to make trouble.

485
00:34:04,425 --> 00:34:06,620
We're threatened by growing crises.

486
00:34:07,025 --> 00:34:07,860
We need

487
00:34:08,225 --> 00:34:09,860
North Liang Army to defend the world

488
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,250
and relieve worries from His Majesty.

489
00:34:12,325 --> 00:34:14,300
The hereditary system of North Liang

490
00:34:14,775 --> 00:34:16,900
will cause trouble in the future.

491
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,620
I...

492
00:34:18,075 --> 00:34:19,820
I ask to see His Majesty.

493
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,180
His Majesty is feeling unwell

494
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:22,800
and he won't see you.

495
00:34:23,675 --> 00:34:24,620
One more thing.

496
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,260
His Majesty ordered

497
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,620
that Prime Minister Zhang

498
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:30,460
should be the witness of this case.

499
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,060
In the future,

500
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:36,100
no officials shall
make improper comments.

501
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,925
How can we stop others

502
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,850
from commenting?

503
00:34:43,025 --> 00:34:44,450
No one else can stop them.

504
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,950
But you can, of course.

505
00:34:49,475 --> 00:34:51,925
Looks like in His Majesty's eyes,

506
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,660
Prime Minister Zhang,

507
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,575
you can awe all the other officials.

508
00:34:57,075 --> 00:34:58,660
His Majesty thinks so highly of you.

509
00:34:58,925 --> 00:35:00,300
I'm indeed jealous.

510
00:35:04,225 --> 00:35:05,100
I...

511
00:35:05,725 --> 00:35:07,300
I've been racking my brains

512
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:10,450
for the prosperity of Liyang.

513
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:14,500
God knows how loyal I am.

514
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:15,700
Mm.

515
00:35:16,075 --> 00:35:17,180
Don't worry, Prime Minister.

516
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,200
I'll tell His Majesty

517
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,180
what you just said.

518
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:31,060
Han Shengxuan,

519
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,340
North Liang still belongs to my family.

520
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,600
What do you think of it?

521
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,875
Thank you, My Lord,

522
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,975
for remembering my name.

523
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,860
The ownership of North Liang

524
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,600
is a national affair.

525
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:46,620
I don't dare to comment.

526
00:35:46,725 --> 00:35:48,900
People call you Han Diaosi.

527
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,405
After this name is used for a long time,

528
00:35:52,725 --> 00:35:54,900
don't forget

529
00:35:55,025 --> 00:35:56,125
your real name Han Shengxuan.

530
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,820
I'm from a humble family.

531
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,260
I don't dare to forget my real name.

532
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,075
Mm.

533
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,180
A man

534
00:36:03,775 --> 00:36:04,700
should not

535
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,020
forget his origin.

536
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:07,060
Also,

537
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:08,975
he should not overstep his authority.

538
00:36:12,175 --> 00:36:13,450
I'll keep in mind

539
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,580
your instruction, My Lord.

540
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:19,740
Hereditament. Hereditament.

541
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,950
A lot of people tried to stop it,

542
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,050
but I made it at last.

543
00:36:24,325 --> 00:36:25,225
Shouldn't you congratulate me?

544
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,250
Congratulations.

545
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:26,750
Mm.

546
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:27,940
Congratulations.

547
00:36:29,075 --> 00:36:29,900
All right.

548
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:31,740
I'm going back to North Liang.

549
00:36:52,775 --> 00:36:53,775
His Majesty

550
00:36:54,225 --> 00:36:56,100
indeed approved of the hereditament

551
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,700
for North Liang.

552
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,425
(Zhao Danping, Longhu Arch-Taoist)
What will Xu Xiao exchange

553
00:37:03,425 --> 00:37:04,300
(Zhao Danping, Longhu Arch-Taoist)

554
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,260
(Zhao Danping, Longhu Arch-Taoist)
for that?

555
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,725
He resigned as Grand Commander.

556
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,900
Grand Commander is a glorious position,

557
00:37:11,275 --> 00:37:12,900
but he has no power.

558
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,600
There's growing unrest in West Chu.

559
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:19,575
His Majesty certainly wants stability
in North Liang.

560
00:37:23,425 --> 00:37:25,700
But he's nursing a viper in his bosom.

561
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,675
What about Gu Jiantang?

562
00:37:26,825 --> 00:37:27,900
Didn't he say anything?

563
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,460
He took a sickie.

564
00:37:30,525 --> 00:37:32,660
Is he going to stay in the capital

565
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,420
for the rest of his life?

566
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,575
I guess

567
00:37:36,675 --> 00:37:39,750
His Majesty will make him
Grand Commander.

568
00:37:40,475 --> 00:37:41,580
His Majesty

569
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:44,500
doesn't want Gu Jiantang
to leave the capital

570
00:37:45,225 --> 00:37:47,775
in case of calamity for the future.

571
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:51,675
Will we just watch the Xu Family

572
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:54,350
rule North Liang
from generation to generation?

573
00:37:54,975 --> 00:37:57,260
His Majesty approved
of the Hereditament,

574
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:00,200
but it doesn't mean

575
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,900
Xu Fengnian can live
until he takes over North Liang.

576
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:08,000
Among Four Longhu Arch-Taoists,

577
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,475
only you can stay in the capital

578
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,300
all year round.

579
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:14,660
Over the years,

580
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,620
you've written

581
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,060
a lot of sacrificial articles.

582
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:20,980
Aren't you fed up?

583
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,825
There's no future for Mount Longhu

584
00:38:25,425 --> 00:38:29,020
unless the court is in peace.

585
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,500
If Xu Fengnian takes over North Liang,

586
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:33,180
it won't be a good thing

587
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,100
for the world

588
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,200
or Mount Longhu.

589
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:41,375
You want me to go back to Mount Longhu

590
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,675
and kill Xu Fengnian?

591
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:49,100
There are four Longhu Arch-Taoists.

592
00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:50,700
Zhao Xituan.

593
00:38:51,025 --> 00:38:52,340
He's your brother's master.

594
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:54,220
He'll show some respect to you, I guess.

595
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:56,060
Zhao Danping is the worst-tempered.

596
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,700
He resides in the capital,

597
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,650
known as Scholar of Sacrificial Article.

598
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:01,940
He hasn't been back
to Mount Longhu for years.

599
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,380
You don't need
to worry about him, either.

600
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,620
You should pay attention

601
00:39:05,725 --> 00:39:08,380
to Zhao Xiyi
who has the highest seniority.

602
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,180
Also,

603
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,900
pay attention to Zhao Danxia,

604
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,875
Chief of Arch-Taoists' Office

605
00:39:13,325 --> 00:39:14,300
and the most powerful leader of Taoism.

606
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,700
They two are horrible enough.

607
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,000
Xu Fengnian

608
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,025
is Xu Xiao's son.

609
00:39:22,575 --> 00:39:23,580
If we really kill him,

610
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,775
Xu Xiao will lead his army
to Mount Longhu!

611
00:39:26,975 --> 00:39:29,260
You don't need to kill him personally.

612
00:39:29,725 --> 00:39:31,540
But he must die.

613
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,450
This concerns

614
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:41,375
the destiny of Liyang.

615
00:39:46,225 --> 00:39:47,775
Now that

616
00:39:48,275 --> 00:39:51,450
you reap benefits from the court,

617
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,540
you should

618
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,700
perform your duty loyally.

619
00:39:57,425 --> 00:39:58,260
By the way,

620
00:39:59,925 --> 00:40:01,340
besides Xu Fengnian,

621
00:40:02,075 --> 00:40:03,660
you should kill one more person.

622
00:40:04,825 --> 00:40:05,780
Who?

623
00:40:07,825 --> 00:40:08,780
Zhao Kai.

624
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:11,980
Who's he?

625
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,220
He's Han Diaosi's disciple

626
00:40:14,725 --> 00:40:16,860
and the illegitimate son of His Majesty.

627
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,740
Now,

628
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:22,800
he's hunting down Xu Fengnian.

629
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,260
The illegitimate son of His Majesty?

630
00:40:40,175 --> 00:40:41,420
Han Diaosi

631
00:40:41,925 --> 00:40:43,860
pretends to cooperate with me.

632
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:47,180
Actually, he wants to kill Xu Fengnian

633
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,620
and cause chaos in the world

634
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:55,500
so that Zhao Kai can fight
for the throne.

635
00:40:57,725 --> 00:40:58,940
He thinks

636
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:01,980
I'm ignorant of his plan.

637
00:41:05,275 --> 00:41:08,940
I've been doing everything

638
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,500
for the eternal peace

639
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:13,620
of Liyang.

640
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:17,980
Xu Fengnian is the bane.

641
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:18,940
He must be killed.

642
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,140
Zhao Kai

643
00:41:21,825 --> 00:41:23,340
will also cause chaos.

644
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,860
You can kill him, too.

645
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,125
Prime Minister,

646
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:30,500
he's an illegitimate son.

647
00:41:31,075 --> 00:41:33,260
But he's a prince, anyway.

648
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:35,220
When you want to assassinate a prince,

649
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:39,135
have you thought about

650
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,700
how you may end up?

651
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,380
I fight for the destiny of Liyang,

652
00:41:46,225 --> 00:41:47,580
and I can't care about

653
00:41:47,925 --> 00:41:50,100
my own destiny.

654
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,500
If Han Diaosi

655
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:57,505
knows about this,

656
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,940
he won't let you go.

657
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,540
He's a mere eunuch,

658
00:42:02,325 --> 00:42:04,500
but he wants to cause big chaos.

659
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,260
He won't let me go.

660
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:09,275
I won't let him go, either.

661
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:13,900
But...

662
00:42:14,075 --> 00:42:14,780
Say no more.

663
00:42:15,525 --> 00:42:17,140
I'll handle the problems in court.

664
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,820
You shall take care of problems

665
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,980
in the martial world.

666
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,380
Zhao Danping.

667
00:42:25,525 --> 00:42:26,200
Mm?

668
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,025
Whose side

669
00:42:30,225 --> 00:42:32,575
will your sect be on?

670
00:42:34,775 --> 00:42:35,820
Prime Minister,

671
00:42:36,675 --> 00:42:38,460
I'm going back
to Mount Longhu immediately.

672
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:41,340
Xu Fengnian and Zhao Kai

673
00:42:41,975 --> 00:42:43,340
will be killed

674
00:42:43,825 --> 00:42:44,700
by us.
