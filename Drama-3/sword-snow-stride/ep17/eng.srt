1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

5
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
=Sword Snow Stride=
(Season 1)

6
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,400
=Episode 17=

7
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,300
(Chunshen Lake Mushan Island)

8
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,400
This way, please.

9
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,450
Kneel down.

10
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,700
(Chunshen Residence)

11
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,390
All of my family

12
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,790
are privileged to see Your Highness.

13
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,710
Everyone, get up.

14
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,870
You especially
don't need to kneel to me.

15
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,640
Please get up.

16
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,710
Get up.

17
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,400
Why did you say

18
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,200
I don't need to kneel to you?

19
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,150
Because according to
military regulations,

20
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,520
you don't have to kneel.

21
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,310
But I retired from the army long ago.

22
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,680
Once you were a soldier,

23
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,000
you'll always be a soldier.

24
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,970
You've never left the army.

25
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,080
Wang Linquan,
foot soldier of Hupu Battalion,

26
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,960
is honored to see Your Highness.

27
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,710
Xu Fengnian,
junior of North Liang Army,

28
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,430
is honored to see you.

29
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,520
Under your leadership,

30
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,910
North Liang will have a bright future.

31
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,120
Your old servant

32
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,590
can die in peace.

33
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,800
Don't call yourself servant.

34
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,360
You're an elder to me.

35
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,590
All right.

36
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,520
Chudong,

37
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,330
come here.

38
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,520
This is my daughter,

39
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,700
Chudong.

40
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,870
(Wang Linquan's youngest daughter
Wang Chudong)

41
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,270
(Wang Linquan's youngest daughter Wang Chudong)
If you don't mind,

42
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,750
let her wait upon you tonight.

43
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:11,840
- Ah?
- Ah?

44
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,360
Father.

45
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,120
(Consort of Jing'an of Liyang
Pei Nanwei)

46
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,870
Where are your manners?

47
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,550
Aunt.

48
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,590
It's wrong.

49
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,240
Mother.

50
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,030
You're in such a hurry.

51
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,190
What happened?

52
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,190
North Liang is our old enemy.

53
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,200
You shouldn't humiliate yourself

54
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,520
in front of the enemy.

55
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,650
What nonsense are you talking about?

56
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,520
You asked Wang Linquan
to welcome Xu Fengnian.

57
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,190
You must've considered it thoroughly.

58
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,320
But you shouldn't have let him
keel to Xu.

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,360
Xu Xiao.

60
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,900
What a master of intrigue.

61
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,320
Does Wang work for Xu Xiao?

62
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,100
Come back.

63
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,870
Where are you going?

64
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,600
I'm going to
kill the whole family of Wang.

65
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,040
Wang has been working for me

66
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,470
under a false identity for years.

67
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,820
Why did he create such a big scene

68
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,070
to meet Xu Fengnian today?

69
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,430
What's his purpose

70
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,870
of exposing his identity now?

71
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,360
It's...

72
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,190
It's a bargain.

73
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,510
Bargain?

74
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,070
Xu Xiao asked Wang
to expose his identity

75
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,090
in order to show me

76
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,350
he's voluntarily removed his spay

77
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,950
in exchange for my guarantee.

78
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,100
Guarantee of what?

79
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,890
Xu Fengnian's hereditary dignity

80
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,420
held in perpetuity.

81
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,570
He wants me to guarantee
that I won't make difficulties.

82
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,730
He's humiliating you.

83
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,120
Xu Fengnian happens to be in Qingzhou.

84
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,000
Shall we kill the Wang family

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,870
and Xu together?

86
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,160
Don't be anxious.

87
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,570
Let's wait for Wang's visit.

88
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,070
How could he come to court death?

89
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,950
He must've run away with Xu Fengnian.

90
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,630
You can go now.

91
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,720
Did Wu Liuding say

92
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,820
we can take action tomorrow?

93
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,680
Yes.

94
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,830
I'll lead the navy
out of camp tomorrow

95
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,950
to intercept and kill Xu Fengnian.

96
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,850
Let him assist us.

97
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,310
Who is it?

98
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,190
Me.

99
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:57,950
Your Highness.

100
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,950
Let me introduce to you.

101
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,830
This is Mr. Wang Linquan.

102
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,240
Aren't you Mr. Lin, the Third Graduate
in the Palace Examination?

103
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,480
Lord of Jing'an is determined to

104
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,870
exterminate your entire family,

105
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,150
leaving no chance for your revival.

106
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,050
I'm in charge of it.

107
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,120
But General

108
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,680
gave your family a chance to live.

109
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,460
Your mother

110
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,160
is right in my residence.

111
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,870
My mother...

112
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,920
Is my mother here?

113
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:38,650
Come.

114
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,920
I'll take you to see her.

115
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,550
Your mother is in there.

116
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,360
Who is it?

117
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,370
(Lin's mother)

118
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:51,840
Mother.

119
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,240
It was all my fault that

120
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,000
our family got into such a situation.

121
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,200
I can't atone for my sin
even I die a hundred times.

122
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,450
North Liang is a dangerous place.

123
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,500
How did you escape

124
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,770
after the failed assassination?

125
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,780
Tell me.

126
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,080
I've taken refuge

127
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,550
under North Liang.

128
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,150
Mother.

129
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,480
How many members of our family

130
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,670
are there left alive?

131
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,550
I come back this time

132
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,790
to send all of you

133
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,310
to North Liang.

134
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,220
Rest assured.

135
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,790
I will avenge myself on it.

136
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,020
Come here.

137
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,120
As a

138
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,430
scholar-gentry family,

139
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,320
we cherish ethics,
rites and law the most.

140
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,000
Xu Xiao is actually a traitor.

141
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,600
Everyone has the right to kill him.

142
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,450
I was proud that

143
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,910
you went to assassinate Xu Fengnian.

144
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,480
Nobody would blame you even if

145
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,200
our entire family was exterminated.

146
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,750
I didn't expect you to be a coward.

147
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,200
I'd rather you die

148
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,480
than you live in infamy!

149
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,600
Mother.

150
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,050
You've turned to North Liang now.

151
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,870
Don't call me mother again.

152
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:24,960
You're

153
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,420
dead to me.

154
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,120
The Lin Family will stay in Qingzhou.

155
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,840
No one will follow you to North Liang.

156
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,870
Get out.

157
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,720
I can send your family out of Qingzhou,

158
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,120
but I have two conditions.

159
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,750
Shoot.

160
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,320
First,

161
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,100
the Lin family has been
stationed in Qingzhou for years

162
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,650
with deep foundation.

163
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,120
Even though they were exterminated,

164
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,100
there are still
old subordinates of theirs.

165
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:19,080
I want you to
take a ship to town tomorrow

166
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,320
and contact the old subordinates.

167
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,260
What for?

168
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:28,840
The Lin Family has been fighting
against Lord of Jing'an for years.

169
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,550
They must know

170
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,480
many of his dirty secrets.

171
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,000
OK.

172
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,320
I'll find out all his secrets

173
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,600
and tell you.

174
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,950
Don't tell me.

175
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,390
Tell His Highness.

176
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,600
What's the other condition?

177
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,120
From now on,

178
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:56,440
you must live only for
the safety of His Highness.

179
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,390
If he sustains any minor injury

180
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,360
in Qingzhou,

181
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,000
I'll turn your family over
to Lord of Jing'an.

182
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:05,930
Do you understand?

183
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:06,790
Uncle Wang.

184
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,350
Hey.

185
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:08,950
Your Highness.

186
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,080
It's General's idea.

187
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,640
Let me take care of it.

188
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,000
I'll die fighting for His Highness.

189
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,600
Till then,

190
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,720
I'll never let him get hurt
or put him in danger.

191
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,270
Good.

192
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,620
Keep that in mind.

193
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,600
Well,

194
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,950
about my daughter...

195
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,510
I was

196
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,910
graceless.

197
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,960
Never mind.

198
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,700
You're an elder to me.

199
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:47,840
How can I do that

200
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,910
to your daughter?

201
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,350
But I'm willing to devote her to you.

202
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,050
But she is not.

203
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:53,300
Oh.

204
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,000
That's right.

205
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,030
Right.

206
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,250
I'll persuade her.

207
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,400
I'll accompany you to town tomorrow.

208
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,450
Hopefully Xu Fengnian
leaves the island today.

209
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,250
If he doesn't,

210
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,220
we'll go all the way to the island.

211
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,670
How mighty you are!

212
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,670
(Chunshen Residence)

213
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,600
Please take care of yourself.

214
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,910
This way.

215
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,360
I'll leave Fengzi Battalion to you.

216
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,600
Lord of Jing'an
has been living in Xiangfan for long.

217
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,480
Once you go to town,

218
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,600
your life is in his hands.

219
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:42,840
Don't worry.

220
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,650
Even if he wants to kill me,

221
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:45,720
he won't do it in town.

222
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,550
Why don't you
take Fengzi Battalion with you?

223
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,670
Without transfer orders
from the Ministry of War

224
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,870
and the imperial edict,

225
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,390
the army of North Liang
can't enter Xiangfan.

226
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,200
Xu Xiao is on his way to the capital.

227
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,360
Don't give our enemy any excuse.

228
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,510
Sounds reasonable.

229
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,200
We have to leave now.

230
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,360
Wait for a minute.

231
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,320
Wait for what?

232
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:01,670
She'll come soon.

233
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,480
In a minute.

234
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,800
Father, do you want to see me?

235
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,370
You need a person

236
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,120
who is familiar with Xiangfan
during the trip.

237
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,800
Let Chudong go with you.

238
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,000
At night,

239
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,970
you may have a chat
and get acquainted with each other.

240
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,120
I won't go.

241
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,960
Don't be childish.

242
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,030
Isn't it enough that

243
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,200
our family take such a big risk
for North Liang?

244
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,790
Why must you devote me to him?

245
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,850
What's so great about him?

246
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,150
He was just born in a powerful family.

247
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,670
You're ridiculous!

248
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,150
I'm ashamed.

249
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,910
Uncle Wang.

250
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,270
I'm going to town by myself.

251
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,630
Don't bother your daughter.

252
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,840
Well...

253
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,510
She has been spoiled since childhood.

254
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,910
Please forgive her

255
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,900
for being impolite.

256
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,600
Don't mention it.

257
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:53,720
Please stay.

258
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,500
We'll see you soon.

259
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,510
Take care.

260
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:57,870
Take care.

261
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,310
The girl talked nonsense just now.

262
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,240
Your Highness,

263
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,110
don't be angry.

264
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,000
How could I be angry with her?

265
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,350
Grandpa Wei,

266
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,450
I feel uncomfortable

267
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,590
because I probably know

268
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,310
Xu Xiao's plans in Qingzhou.

269
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,560
Xu Xiao has a similar style
to my master.

270
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,440
His plans are usually interlinked.

271
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,270
Since Uncle Wang is exposed,

272
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,550
I think his next move

273
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,890
has been quite ready.

274
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,750
I've figured it out
since Wang Linquan proposed to

275
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,070
let his daughter sleep with me.

276
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,020
Oh.

277
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,920
Let's talk about it
after we get into town.

278
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,480
Hopefully I worried too much.

279
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:46,120
(Chunshen Residence)

280
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,240
Didn't I give you orders

281
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,680
and ask you to stay on the island?

282
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,310
We're all dressed as scholars.

283
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,270
Everything will be fine.

284
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,120
Will a scholar take this?

285
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,820
Put it away.

286
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,880
What about the two little fellas?

287
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,400
They stayed on the island

288
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,550
with Yu Youwei.

289
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,790
She has a cat.

290
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,160
She may take care of them.

291
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,920
Go away.

292
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:21,690
Go away.

293
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,420
Go away.

294
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,880
Go away.

295
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,570
Don't come.

296
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,400
Don't come.

297
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,550
Stay away.

298
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,920
Your Highness.

299
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,650
There are ships.

300
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,240
What a coincidence.

301
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,070
It seems God wants him to die.

302
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,160
Father. Come here.

303
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,070
Look.

304
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,350
The navy of Qingzhou.

305
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,510
If you saw it,

306
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,110
why didn't you take me to the dock?

307
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,350
It's too late.

308
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,590
It's too late when you get to the dock

309
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,750
and take a boat.

310
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,480
I...

311
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,870
I should have gone with His Highness.

312
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,270
He's about to run into them.

313
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,550
Zhao Heng and his son are not fools.

314
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,480
If they kill His Highness,

315
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,520
the army of North Liang
will storm into Qingzhou.

316
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,510
We mustn't miss the chance today.

317
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,030
After he's dead,

318
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,200
we'll send his body to North Liang.

319
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,830
It's good enough.

320
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,680
Don't mind his father.

321
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,070
When he arrives,

322
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,280
Xu Fengnian will be dead already.

323
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,480
Don't move the flagship.

324
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,550
The left and right ships,

325
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,400
sink the enemies' ship.

326
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,550
None of them shall survive!

327
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,750
They are coming to us.

328
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,100
Halt!

329
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,550
Take in sail.

330
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,270
What's the pole used for?

331
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,370
It's patting pole,

332
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:41,400
used to smash ship.

333
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,880
It's tremendously heavy.

334
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,960
With two pats,

335
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,230
the ship will sink.

336
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,480
Your Highness.

337
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,570
Can we use our weapons?

338
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:12,800
Sure.

339
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,790
Here.

340
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,020
Break off!

341
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:46,960
Fengqi.

342
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,260
What a valiant general.

343
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,400
He's great.

344
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,070
Get ready!

345
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,620
(Zhao)

346
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,170
(Zhao)

347
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,270
(Zhao)

348
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,800
(Zhao)

349
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:10,920
(Zhao)

350
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,070
(Zhao)

351
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:36,910
Thanks.

352
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,000
Thank His Highness.

353
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,070
He asked me to protect you.

354
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,790
Ning Emei.

355
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,080
Yes.

356
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,210
Seize the ship.

357
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:23,820
Wow.

358
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,260
What a bold strategy!

359
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,760
Grandpa Wei,

360
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,210
can you go aboard the ship?

361
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,460
A piece of cake.

362
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,480
Is he going to pull the ship by hand?

363
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,660
Sir, please help us.

364
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,960
They are just small fry

365
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,380
unworthy of being my opponent.

366
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,140
Does he have supernatural power?

367
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,900
It looks like Chixia Swordplay.

368
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:09,760
Enough.

369
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,860
It's said that North Liang have
many masters.

370
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,430
As we can see,

371
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,520
they deserve the reputation.

372
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:03,830
Get my Immortal Arm Bow.

373
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:04,930
Yes.

374
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,630
It's all right.

375
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,130
Your family have been
sent away one by one.

376
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:20,110
Uncle Wang saved many people.

377
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,240
He didn't knock walnut in vain.

378
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,590
He's almost mastered Dahuangting.

379
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,760
They finally come.

380
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,670
Yet they don't move.

381
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:30,730
I'm afraid they're frightened to death.

382
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,870
The so-called Sword Tomb
of the Wu family is just so-so.

383
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:35,110
Witnessing the fight,

384
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,390
why doesn't the boat leave?

385
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:56,390
What does he want?

386
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,240
Who is this?

387
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,590
Is that Xu Fengnian?

388
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,240
Who is it?

389
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:22,960
Sword Tomb.

390
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,480
Wu Liuding.

391
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:25,800
Your mother

392
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,670
fled from her family

393
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,630
and damaged its reputation.

394
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,300
Someone must

395
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,720
pay for that.

396
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,350
Mother's debt should be paid by her son.

397
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,350
I will bear

398
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,000
my mother's misfortune.

399
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,800
If you have the guts,

400
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,400
go to North Liang to collect your debts.

401
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,720
If you say so,

402
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,040
I won't stop you.

403
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,180
What is he doing?

404
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,190
Is Sword Tomb of the Wu family
actually so powerful?

405
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,580
(Zhao)

406
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,320
Don't you dare annoy me!

407
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:45,910
Who're you?

408
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,200
None of your business.

409
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,440
Your Highness!

410
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,780
(Zhao)

411
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,360
He can use
his genuine spirit skillfully.

412
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,270
Who is the old man?

413
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:46,520
Catch.

414
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,820
Retreat!

415
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,580
Here.

416
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,330
Fujiang Armor.

417
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:32,810
Take care.

418
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,290
Throw halberds.

419
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,930
Where did the armor come from?

420
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,670
Who are the people

421
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,600
on the flagship

422
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,080
trying to assassinate Xu Fengnian?

423
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,930
No matter who they are,

424
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:18,970
they've made a big mistake.

425
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,080
Attacking the son of Lord of North Liang

426
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,330
is a crime that can be
directly reported to the emperor.

427
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:37,520
His ship comes over.

428
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:39,600
He's well protected by those freaks.

429
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,040
It's hard to kill him.

430
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,490
(Zhao)

431
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:43,450
Bring him up.

432
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,090
Yes.

433
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,290
You're not with the government.

434
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,770
You'd better leave.

435
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:49,480
I'm getting off, then.

436
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,410
I'll call on you
when I get back to town.

437
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,570
Son of Lord of Jing'an invites
Son of Lord of North Liang to board.

438
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,410
I've long heard of your name.

439
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,870
Today I have the honor to meet you.

440
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,450
You're true to your name.

441
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,000
Son of Lord of Jing'an.

442
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:46,890
That's me.

443
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,810
Did you try to kill me?

444
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:50,810
It's a shame.

445
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:53,020
I was on a drill with the navy,

446
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:54,770
not expecting a villain took over power.

447
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,250
The villain dared to

448
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,330
assassinate Mr. Xu.

449
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,990
Fortunately, you're not hurt.

450
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,120
I'm so relieved.

451
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,870
Didn't you say he took over power?

452
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,890
Why is he tied up?

453
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,000
During the chaos,

454
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,080
I took the opportunity

455
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,390
to overpower him.

456
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,040
Except for seizing the ship,

457
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:21,040
he tried to assassinate you.

458
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,410
He is so vicious.

459
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:23,410
Who is he?

460
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:24,870
The son of Wei Dong,

461
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:25,890
and the commander of navy,

462
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:26,930
Wei Wei.

463
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:28,970
Was him the one who shot arrows?

464
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:30,560
Yes, it was him.

465
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,990
Does he know

466
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:33,450
it's a capital crime?

467
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:34,990
You're right.

468
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,160
Assassinating the son of
Lord of North Liang

469
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,730
is surely a capital crime.

470
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:39,730
Let me

471
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:40,870
seek justice

472
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,470
for you.

473
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:57,140
Mr. Xu,

474
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:58,370
have you cooled down?

475
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,680
You're fast.

476
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,140
To eliminate traitors for the country

477
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,120
is of great urgency.

478
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,930
You're fully prepared, aren't you?

479
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,930
I don't know what you're talking about.

480
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:18,080
Don't you
have any responsibilities at all?

481
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,810
After all, it was my man who did this.

482
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:24,560
Though I'm innocent,

483
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,680
I must be blamed for
not disciplining them well.

484
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:28,340
Please forgive me, Mr. Xu.

485
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,160
Would you have a drink with me

486
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,790
so I can make an apology?

487
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,820
There's blood on your nose.

488
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,620
Thanks.

489
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,590
What do you want?

490
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:52,770
Don't waste your money
on inviting me to drink.

491
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,490
I'll take that as your apology.

492
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,930
Xu Fengnian!

493
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:56,540
Em?

494
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,490
Why don't you call me Mr. Xu?

495
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,770
As long as it cools you down.

496
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:14,330
You're broad-minded.

497
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,770
Lord of Jing'an has a good son.

498
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,370
I'm impressed.

499
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,370
They are all right.

500
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:43,370
Xu Fengnian has many masters
work for him.

501
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,370
How can you call his name directly?

502
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,720
He has a lecherous
and lustful reputation.

503
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,920
I didn't expect him
to be worse than in the rumors.

504
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:52,970
On arriving at the island,

505
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,320
he wants to take me away.

506
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,160
I won't listen to

507
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,390
such a playboy.

508
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,250
It has nothing to do

509
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,080
with His Highness.

510
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:03,250
I proposed it.

511
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,890
When he leaves Xiangfan,

512
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:11,020
you should go with him.

513
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,640
You just met him,

514
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,540
yet you want
to devote your daughter to him.

515
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:15,890
Why?

516
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:20,170
It's for your own good.

517
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:31,040
The assassin
who ambushed from underwater

518
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,570
was Fujiang Armor again.

519
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:35,160
It seems that those who want to kill me

520
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:36,770
have followed me to Qingzhou.

521
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:39,810
Whose instigation was he under?

522
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,240
Was it Zhao Xun?

523
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,680
If it was him,

524
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,450
Fujiang Armor would

525
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:47,640
cooperate better with him.

526
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:49,410
The one who tried to kill me

527
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:50,940
was using Zhao Xun.

528
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,370
Unfortunately...

529
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,120
Unfortunately, we don't know who it is.

530
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,850
