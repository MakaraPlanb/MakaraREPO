1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

5
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
=Sword Snow Stride=
(Season 1)

6
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,400
=Episode 2=

7
00:01:34,175 --> 00:01:38,300
(Lingzhou, North Liang)

8
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:45,925
Your Highness,

9
00:01:46,175 --> 00:01:47,560
why not get on the horse
with His Highness?

10
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:49,900
Your Highness.

11
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,560
No.

12
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,359
Brother,

13
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,575
I'm taking you back home.

14
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,225
(Lingzhou)

15
00:02:09,075 --> 00:02:10,975
(Mansion of Lord of North Liang)

16
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,439
Your Highness,

17
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,120
let me carry His Highness.

18
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,775
Keep your voice down.

19
00:02:14,225 --> 00:02:15,775
(Mansion of Lord of North Liang)
His Highness's house is being cleaned up.

20
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:16,425
His Lordship ordered

21
00:02:16,425 --> 00:02:18,150
that His Highness be sent
to his house instead.

22
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,840
It's been three years.

23
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:02,719
You must have had a hard time.

24
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:05,960
I didn't.

25
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,479
A sightseeing tour wasn't very hard.

26
00:07:00,825 --> 00:07:01,675
He's tired, too.

27
00:07:14,525 --> 00:07:15,550
Jiang Ni.

28
00:07:15,975 --> 00:07:18,254
It's been three years
and you're still so thin.

29
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,008
(Jiang Ni, maid in Wutong House)

30
00:07:24,975 --> 00:07:25,816
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

31
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,325
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

32
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,199
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

33
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,439
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

34
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,480
Here comes Xu Xiao.

35
00:07:43,525 --> 00:07:44,839
My father likes to kill.

36
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,000
If you don't hide,

37
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,175
I'm afraid you'll be killed.

38
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:53,475
Here.

39
00:08:40,675 --> 00:08:41,759
He's still asleep?

40
00:08:42,275 --> 00:08:43,320
He was asleep just now.

41
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,480
Young Master Longxiang
is accompanying him in the room.

42
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,900
Look.

43
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,325
Am I smartly dressed?

44
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,875
Yes,

45
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:02,825
unless you're observed carefully.

46
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,075
What are you talking about?

47
00:09:04,425 --> 00:09:05,475
Unless I'm observed carefully?

48
00:09:05,475 --> 00:09:07,275
Don't you know
what kind of person my son is?

49
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,639
He's quite fastidious.

50
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:09,525
Come on.

51
00:09:09,525 --> 00:09:10,639
Have the maids freshen me up.

52
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:11,425
- Quickly.
- Come on.

53
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:12,875
- Yes.
- Yes.

54
00:09:17,075 --> 00:09:19,039
I see that many of the maids are new.

55
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:19,600
Yes.

56
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,025
Read out our family rules

57
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:21,960
to them.

58
00:09:22,425 --> 00:09:23,075
All right.

59
00:09:25,775 --> 00:09:27,000
Listen carefully.

60
00:09:27,975 --> 00:09:29,519
When His Lordship meets His Highness,

61
00:09:30,275 --> 00:09:31,559
wise up.

62
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,625
Even if His Lordship
were beaten to death,

63
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,000
you would pretend you didn't see that.

64
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,125
Right.

65
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,960
You must keep this in mind.

66
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,300
- Yes.
- Yes.

67
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,950
Mm.

68
00:09:45,275 --> 00:09:46,050
Wait.

69
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,225
Come closer.

70
00:09:48,425 --> 00:09:49,440
Look at me.

71
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,559
Do I look amiable?

72
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,480
- Please spare me, My Lord.
- Please spare me, My Lord.

73
00:09:55,525 --> 00:09:56,840
Leave me, all of you.

74
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:58,799
- Yes.
- Yes.

75
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,625
Dear son.

76
00:10:15,775 --> 00:10:16,675
You're awake?

77
00:10:18,275 --> 00:10:19,120
Are you feeling better?

78
00:10:22,025 --> 00:10:22,900
It's been three years.

79
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,475
Ah.

80
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,559
Do you know what I suffered

81
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,840
during the three years?

82
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,600
Yes, yes.

83
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,675
I'm sorry.

84
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,375
I...

85
00:10:32,475 --> 00:10:34,440
Why did you force me to travel widely?

86
00:10:35,075 --> 00:10:35,759
You missed.

87
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,250
Don't. Don't.

88
00:10:37,325 --> 00:10:38,195
Stop it!

89
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,639
What's the point of losing your temper?

90
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,240
Take a rest first.

91
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,279
Let's talk after that.

92
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,050
You were just back.

93
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,050
Don't. Don't.

94
00:10:44,525 --> 00:10:45,275
Stop running.

95
00:10:45,275 --> 00:10:46,300
- You're not wearing your shoes.
- Stop running.

96
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,120
Put on your shoes.

97
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,679
Put them on.

98
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,150
Don't get hurt.

99
00:10:50,325 --> 00:10:51,240
Don't touch it!

100
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,480
It's quite expensive!

101
00:10:54,425 --> 00:10:56,625
Then I should apologize to you, Father.

102
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,925
Don't. Don't.

103
00:10:58,925 --> 00:10:59,825
Ouch.

104
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,450
Don't bother to apologize.

105
00:11:01,925 --> 00:11:04,279
D-D-Don't call me Father.
Call me by my name.

106
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:06,000
It sounds closer.

107
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,240
You're agile.

108
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,159
Enough, son.

109
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,975
Son.

110
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,725
Son.

111
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,450
It's very cold out here.

112
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:13,750
Without shoes, you'll catch a cold.

113
00:11:14,025 --> 00:11:14,875
All right, then.

114
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,320
Oh, no.

115
00:11:21,525 --> 00:11:22,919
It's worth three mansions.

116
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
Let me close the door.

117
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:38,799
After the door is closed,

118
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,279
vent your anger however you like.

119
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:41,399
In this way, you can also

120
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,559
save my dignity.

121
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,039
Again?

122
00:11:53,525 --> 00:11:54,320
Could you cut it out?

123
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,879
What...?

124
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:55,925
- What do I do?
- Wait a minute.

125
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,100
I'll let you go today.

126
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,039
But this isn't over.

127
00:12:02,575 --> 00:12:03,399
Wait and see.

128
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:04,625
I will. I will.

129
00:12:07,325 --> 00:12:08,039
I'm tired.

130
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,080
Tired?

131
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,360
You're tired?

132
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,125
Tired...

133
00:12:17,425 --> 00:12:18,279
Come on.

134
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,039
Here.

135
00:12:19,675 --> 00:12:20,399
Be seated.

136
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,025
Let me

137
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,919
help you put on your shoes.

138
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,600
You help your son put on his shoes?

139
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,200
How embarrassing it will be
if others see this!

140
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,600
Look.

141
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,200
We're still close father and son.

142
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,200
It's very polite of you, son.

143
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,360
Brother, let me help you.

144
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,350
I'll do it myself.

145
00:12:54,675 --> 00:12:55,320
Brother,

146
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:56,399
you're no longer angry?

147
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:57,600
I'm no longer angry.

148
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:01,275
Three years was quite a long time.

149
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:05,900
Say no more.

150
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,450
It's getting late.

151
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,120
Go back to your room and sleep.

152
00:13:09,725 --> 00:13:10,519
But Brother...

153
00:13:10,925 --> 00:13:12,150
I'm not leaving anymore.

154
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,450
Let's go fishing tomorrow.

155
00:13:14,775 --> 00:13:15,425
Off you go.

156
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:16,950
Wait.

157
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,559
Say good night to Father.

158
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:21,919
Father,

159
00:13:22,075 --> 00:13:23,159
I'm going to sleep. Good night.

160
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,240
Go ahead.

161
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:33,360
How do you feel now?

162
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,559
Have you had enough sleep?

163
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:37,440
I still feel tired.

164
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,679
You do?

165
00:13:38,775 --> 00:13:39,840
Get more sleep, then.

166
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:40,919
No.

167
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,919
Something is confusing me.

168
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,879
What is it?

169
00:13:44,775 --> 00:13:46,320
I want to see

170
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,879
the captured veteran of West Chu.

171
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:49,639
Now?

172
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:50,525
Now.

173
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,225
All right.

174
00:13:53,475 --> 00:13:54,200
I'll take you to see him.

175
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,375
Wait for me out there.

176
00:13:56,675 --> 00:13:57,919
I'll get changed.

177
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:59,679
Right, right.

178
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:05,799
Somebody.

179
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,600
Come and dress him up.

180
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:11,399
Little Jiang Ni,

181
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,440
don't come out

182
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,375
until we leave.

183
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,960
Keep your dagger carefully.

184
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:22,825
Ouch.

185
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,850
Xu Fengnian!

186
00:15:27,175 --> 00:15:28,225
Away you go.

187
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:29,175
Don't bother to guard here.

188
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,039
Leave.

189
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,559
- Yes.
- Yes.

190
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:33,475
Off you go. Quickly.

191
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:34,125
Leave.

192
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:38,759
Lead the way.

193
00:15:38,775 --> 00:15:39,450
Yes.

194
00:15:45,925 --> 00:15:47,519
It's Jiang Ni

195
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,000
who is hiding under your bed, isn't it?

196
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,759
I told you

197
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:52,159
I would take care of my own maids

198
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:52,960
and you should not interfere.

199
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,159
Don't forget those who assassinated you

200
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:55,279
were all from West Chu.

201
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,600
Considering Jiang Ni's identity,

202
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:57,559
she must be involved.

203
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:59,440
Have you ever thought

204
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,475
that maybe she portrayed you?

205
00:16:02,575 --> 00:16:03,471
All right.

206
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:04,250
Fine.

207
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,000
She's your maid.

208
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,175
I won't interfere.

209
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:14,879
Xu!

210
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,360
Feng!

211
00:16:17,325 --> 00:16:18,080
Nian!

212
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,159
Xu Xiao?

213
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,160
Xu Xiao!

214
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:06,680
Countless deceased soldiers
are watching you.

215
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,240
You won't end up well.

216
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
Don't let them just watch me.

217
00:17:09,575 --> 00:17:10,799
Ask them to come and fight me.

218
00:17:12,175 --> 00:17:13,000
Talk to him.

219
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,880
Xu Xiao!

220
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,279
Your son survived the first assassination,
but he won't survive a second one.

221
00:17:17,075 --> 00:17:18,240
Soon, someone will make you

222
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,720
handle the funeral for him!

223
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:21,759
All right.

224
00:17:24,575 --> 00:17:25,775
Are you afraid of death?

225
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,880
When you assassinated me
outside Lingzhou,

226
00:17:34,475 --> 00:17:36,039
none of you could get away.

227
00:17:37,225 --> 00:17:38,359
In this case,

228
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,599
you're not afraid of death.

229
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,750
I've been thinking of one question.

230
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,240
In Apricot Flower Wine Shop
outside of the town,

231
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:52,200
why did you put down your broadsword?

232
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,200
Oh no.

233
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,525
It's the North Liang Cavalry.

234
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,240
Now that you're not even
afraid of death,

235
00:18:08,975 --> 00:18:10,175
why did you surrender?

236
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:14,319
I asked you to surrender

237
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:15,279
and then you did.

238
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,440
You were quite obedient, weren't you?

239
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:23,599
Xu Xiao.

240
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,275
What?

241
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,200
Do you remember
the Halberd Troops of West Chu?

242
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,440
I certainly do.

243
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,559
During the War of Destroying West Chu,

244
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:32,400
none of the Halberd Troops

245
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,759
surrendered.

246
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:34,879
They all died in the war.

247
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,480
That's right.

248
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,200
In this case,

249
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,759
you should have fought me
until you died.

250
00:18:40,675 --> 00:18:42,155
Why did you surrender?

251
00:18:47,425 --> 00:18:48,440
You don't confess, do you?

252
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,550
Very well.

253
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,799
Let me guess.

254
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,475
You think the assassination against me
isn't over yet.

255
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,160
Even if I survived outside of the town,

256
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,920
I would still end up dead.

257
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,880
With a certain outcome,

258
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,400
you consider staying alive.

259
00:19:12,825 --> 00:19:14,050
Or else,

260
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,039
you want to see how sad Xu Xiao will be

261
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,559
after I die.

262
00:19:22,825 --> 00:19:24,440
Maybe I'm just afraid of death.

263
00:19:24,575 --> 00:19:26,279
You're abasing yourself already.

264
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,680
Sounds like you don't want me
to keep guessing.

265
00:19:34,775 --> 00:19:36,079
This is Lingzhou.

266
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,480
The center of North Liang.

267
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,039
How can you kill me?

268
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,850
North Liang Army, right?

269
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,000
You only started the assassination.

270
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,799
The mole will continue the conspiracy.

271
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,319
You're not a playboy.

272
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,599
Why am I not?

273
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,750
I'm the number one playboy, aren't I?

274
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,720
Everybody knows that.

275
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,400
Xu Fengnian.

276
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,640
You're so perfectly disguised.

277
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,599
Looks like I've guessed right.

278
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,999
Could you please let me know?

279
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:20,125
Who, in North Liang Army,

280
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,425
wants to kill me?

281
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,119
Torture me.

282
00:20:33,225 --> 00:20:34,400
I don't have to.

283
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,039
I'll wait until he comes to me.

284
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:43,750
I'm done talking.

285
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,400
Ah?

286
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:45,675
- You are?
- Mm.

287
00:20:45,675 --> 00:20:46,425
All right, then.

288
00:20:46,675 --> 00:20:47,960
Let's go have a private talk.

289
00:20:50,425 --> 00:20:51,119
Xu Xiao!

290
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,200
Xu Fengnian!

291
00:20:52,425 --> 00:20:53,800
You'll die!

292
00:20:54,675 --> 00:20:57,075
You'll die!

293
00:21:08,865 --> 00:21:11,425
(Chu)

294
00:21:14,425 --> 00:21:16,167
(Chu)

295
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,450
I'm too young

296
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,160
to appreciate

297
00:21:21,725 --> 00:21:23,350
the glory of the Halberd Troops.

298
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,079
You bought me food and drink.

299
00:21:28,975 --> 00:21:30,319
I'm giving you this flag in return.

300
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:53,200
(Chu)

301
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,900
(Chu)

302
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,519
As for your portrait,

303
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,325
I'll give you an explanation.

304
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,480
From tomorrow on,

305
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,480
I'll be a playboy who does nothing,

306
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,160
but idles away his time
in pleasure-seeking.

307
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,700
I don't need an explanation.

308
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,599
You don't need
to aggrieve yourself, do you?

309
00:22:26,825 --> 00:22:28,039
Rich playboys

310
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:29,880
are good at being on the tiles.

311
00:22:30,175 --> 00:22:31,279
I don't aggrieve myself.

312
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:32,079
I know.

313
00:22:32,425 --> 00:22:33,599
You do everything

314
00:22:33,775 --> 00:22:35,519
to pretend that you're clumsy.

315
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,799
You're already doing a good job.

316
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:38,960
But others

317
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:40,480
may not believe that.

318
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:41,880
Who doesn't believe that?

319
00:22:43,225 --> 00:22:44,720
Do you remember

320
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,680
why I asked you
to travel widely three years ago?

321
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,680
To get away from the marriage
granted by the royal family.

322
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,440
Exactly.

323
00:22:49,725 --> 00:22:51,240
Princess Suizhu

324
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,640
is always mollycoddled.

325
00:22:53,075 --> 00:22:55,119
If the royal family really believes

326
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:56,319
that you're a playboy

327
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:57,319
with a tattered reputation,

328
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,276
will they still

329
00:22:58,276 --> 00:22:59,480
summon you to the capital city

330
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:00,920
and marry her?

331
00:23:03,975 --> 00:23:04,775
Fengnian,

332
00:23:05,975 --> 00:23:07,575
you're my son,

333
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:10,640
the heir of North Liang Cavalry.

334
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,160
Considering your role,

335
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:15,119
you can't get away from schemes.

336
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:18,440
Who told you I would inherit
North Liang Cavalry?

337
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:21,325
A-Are you going to keep hiding?

338
00:23:21,325 --> 00:23:22,480
H-Hiding away?

339
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,039
Who can I pass North Liang Cavalry to?

340
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,920
Except you, who else can I pass it to?

341
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,559
I'm hungry.

342
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:28,559
I don't want to argue with you.

343
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,480
Fine.

344
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,160
Let's go have dinner.

345
00:23:34,825 --> 00:23:35,480
You know what?

346
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:38,079
I asked the cooks
to make deer tendons for you

347
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:40,079
as well as fresh seafood.

348
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:42,440
Fresh eggs

349
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,880
and hot crystal dumplings.

350
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,759
I'll have them sent

351
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,160
to your room.

352
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,950
I want sweet potatoes.

353
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,475
Sweet potatoes?

354
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:02,279
Old Huang!

355
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:03,825
You're eating alone again.

356
00:24:09,425 --> 00:24:11,000
Go. Go fetch two bowls.

357
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,600
Here.

358
00:24:35,425 --> 00:24:36,599
What are you doing?

359
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,275
I just want some wine from you.

360
00:24:38,275 --> 00:24:39,480
Don't look as if I were killing you.

361
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:42,920
Be careful. Don't spill any.

362
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,050
- Or it'll be wasted.
- All right.

363
00:24:46,225 --> 00:24:47,160
Help yourself. Quickly.

364
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,640
Old Huang always eats fast.

365
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,839
Be quick, or you'll have nothing to eat.

366
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:51,450
All right.

367
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,325
Xu Xiao,

368
00:25:00,675 --> 00:25:01,880
when I was traveling for three years,

369
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,600
Old Huang kept advising me
to practice martial arts.

370
00:25:06,425 --> 00:25:07,559
You asked him to, didn't you?

371
00:25:12,775 --> 00:25:14,200
During the three years,

372
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,000
we got in a great deal of trouble.

373
00:25:17,575 --> 00:25:18,960
How much trouble was arranged by you?

374
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:21,880
Most of the trouble

375
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,050
was caused by yourself.

376
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,325
Why did you do that?

377
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:27,759
To make me temper myself?

378
00:25:29,425 --> 00:25:30,700
Man who travels far

379
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:33,039
knows more.

380
00:25:37,575 --> 00:25:38,599
Old Huang

381
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,799
ran away from White Fox

382
00:25:41,725 --> 00:25:43,875
because he wanted me
to face the assassination alone.

383
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,175
You arranged it too, didn't you?

384
00:25:50,025 --> 00:25:51,599
He knew everything.

385
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:52,225
Shut up.

386
00:25:54,725 --> 00:25:55,480
Look.

387
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:57,355
You're so clever

388
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:58,880
and scheming.

389
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,025
You're born
to take over North Liang Cavalry.

390
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,000
Save your breath.

391
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,650
Enjoy the meat.

392
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:07,960
Don't only focus on the meat.

393
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,875
Let's have a drink.

394
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:09,875
Yes, yes.

395
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,125
Come on.

396
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,279
I'm full.

397
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,240
I'll sleep here tonight.

398
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:11,300
What?

399
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,720
Why will you sleep here?

400
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:16,680
Tomorrow, I'll be a playboy again.

401
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,960
Tonight, pretend I was still on a trip.

402
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,525
Come on, son.

403
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:23,950
Would you like to travel with me?

404
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,850
I'll leave you alone.

405
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,650
Are you exhausted?

406
00:27:50,325 --> 00:27:52,366
I was physically exhausted
when I traveled widely.

407
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,119
When I'm back here,

408
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:56,525
I'm mentally exhausted.

409
00:28:02,025 --> 00:28:04,039
You misunderstood something.

410
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:05,800
What?

411
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,775
It's not your father

412
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:10,444
who wanted you to practice martial arts.

413
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:12,675
But I thought

414
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,480
if you got in trouble,

415
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,400
you could protect yourself
with martial arts.

416
00:28:23,075 --> 00:28:24,125
Forget it.

417
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:25,975
Say no more.

418
00:28:26,525 --> 00:28:27,480
We're going fishing tomorrow.

419
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,440
- Old Huang, come over.
- Mm.

420
00:28:29,025 --> 00:28:29,800
Fishing?

421
00:28:30,725 --> 00:28:32,850
Someone in North Liang Army
wants to kill me.

422
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,530
I must hook him.

423
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,400
You drool when you sleep?

424
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,039
Xu Fengnian!

425
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,839
Don't get up.
You're not properly dressed.

426
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,440
Give it back to me.

427
00:30:06,025 --> 00:30:07,599
Let's make a deal.

428
00:30:07,925 --> 00:30:09,440
You can assassinate me.

429
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,440
But if you fail, you must give me money.

430
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,839
You failed last night, didn't you?

431
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:13,900
You...

432
00:30:16,225 --> 00:30:17,400
I'll take the money.

433
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,960
Don't go too far.

434
00:30:23,975 --> 00:30:25,839
How many more coins will you take?

435
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,759
Save as many coins as you can.

436
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,839
Go.

437
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:44,440
Go fishing with me.

438
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:47,240
I won't.

439
00:30:53,675 --> 00:30:55,050
I can pay you.

440
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,575
If you don't want the coins,
I'll take them back.

441
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,279
You'll get them
when we reach the lake.

442
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,025
(Tingchao Pavilion,
Mansion of Lord of North Liang)

443
00:31:31,475 --> 00:31:34,355
(Propitious Omens)

444
00:31:38,775 --> 00:31:41,100
(Tingchao Pavilion)

445
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:02,150
(Hongshu, maid in Wutong House)

446
00:32:08,175 --> 00:32:14,450
(Tingchao Pavilion)

447
00:32:49,575 --> 00:32:51,160
Thank you for saving His Highness.

448
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,000
As his maids,

449
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,319
we can offer nothing to repay you.

450
00:32:55,775 --> 00:32:56,799
This is a fresh melon.

451
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:57,759
It's very sweet.

452
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,025
No, thanks.

453
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,200
You don't like to talk?

454
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,225
You've got a temper like Qingniao.

455
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,319
That's her.

456
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:17,748
(Qingniao, maid in Wutong House)

457
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,559
You're so beautiful.

458
00:34:08,575 --> 00:34:09,550
You must have been waiting
for a long time.

459
00:34:13,725 --> 00:34:14,500
Brother.

460
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,450
Let's do some fishing.

461
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:48,025
Bait the hook.

462
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,199
This is my younger brother,

463
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:10,950
Xu Longxiang.

464
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,559
You've met him.

465
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,100
He's born with extraordinary power.

466
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,480
This is Qingniao.

467
00:35:24,175 --> 00:35:25,440
This is Hongshu.

468
00:35:25,725 --> 00:35:26,884
They're my maids.

469
00:35:29,675 --> 00:35:30,480
And this...

470
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,440
This is Jiang Ni.

471
00:35:32,675 --> 00:35:33,400
Pay me.

472
00:35:45,175 --> 00:35:46,199
Three maids?

473
00:35:46,975 --> 00:35:48,800
In Wutong House
where His Highness lives,

474
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:50,675
there are more than 20 maids.

475
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:53,925
They're just not needed for fishing.

476
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:58,239
So many maids for you?

477
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,559
I'm lucky to live such a good life.

478
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:05,225
You're jealous of me?

479
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,950
You promised me

480
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:10,900
that I could enter Tingchao Pavilion.

481
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,175
Tingchao Pavilion is back there.

482
00:36:14,175 --> 00:36:15,725
You can go whenever you want.

483
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:17,480
For only two hours, though.

484
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,920
I allowed you to get in,

485
00:36:23,275 --> 00:36:24,920
but you couldn't stay there
for a long time.

486
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,320
Tell me what you want.

487
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,239
First, I want to know your name.

488
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:41,925
Nangong Puye.

489
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,159
The Nangong Family of North Mang.

490
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,480
That's weird.

491
00:36:55,925 --> 00:36:58,960
(Nangong Puye, swordswoman of North Mang)
You came to Liyang to learn martial arts?

492
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:01,639
North Liang Cavalry of my family

493
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:03,719
is what your emperor hates most.

494
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:05,719
Are you going to break your promise?

495
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:07,960
Let me ask something.

496
00:37:08,675 --> 00:37:09,400
Go ahead.

497
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,039
Who, in North Liang Army,
do you think wants to kill me?

498
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,519
If you die,

499
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,800
who will wield the military power,
except your younger brother?

500
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,200
My father

501
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,719
has six adopted sons.

502
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:27,100
They're all appointed
to important positions in the army.

503
00:37:30,175 --> 00:37:31,159
I'm afraid

504
00:37:31,675 --> 00:37:33,400
one of them wants to kill you.

505
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,960
So, I'm in danger for the moment.

506
00:37:38,525 --> 00:37:39,559
It's none of my business.

507
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:41,519
How about this?

508
00:37:41,925 --> 00:37:43,199
Be my bodyguard for a couple of days.

509
00:37:43,825 --> 00:37:45,700
But many masters work for your family.

510
00:37:53,775 --> 00:37:55,079
If you serve as my bodyguard,

511
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,079
you can stay in Tingchao Pavilion

512
00:37:58,775 --> 00:38:00,119
as long

513
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,159
as you want.

514
00:38:12,825 --> 00:38:13,840
Deal.

515
00:38:18,143 --> 00:38:21,167
(Chu Lushan, Xu Xiao's adopted son)

516
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:32,975
I'll grill it tonight.

517
00:38:34,175 --> 00:38:35,320
Add some salt

518
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,250
and it'll taste better.

519
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,600
I've got the salt ready.

520
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,360
A pinch of salt makes it smell good

521
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,400
and gives you strength.

522
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,425
You used to be too lazy to eat perch.

523
00:38:43,425 --> 00:38:44,450
As for carp like this,

524
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:46,225
you never ate any.

525
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,650
You never tried the grilled fish
Old Huang made.

526
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,675
Delicious.

527
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,250
What exactly have you suffered
in the past three years?

528
00:38:54,175 --> 00:38:55,275
He deserved it.

529
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:11,519
It appeared in the wine shop.

530
00:39:11,875 --> 00:39:13,159
White Eagle from Jinzhou?

531
00:39:14,025 --> 00:39:14,760
You're sharp-eyed.

532
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:16,079
I've been raising it since it was born.

533
00:39:17,175 --> 00:39:18,760
It's priceless.

534
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,500
It's a six-year-old eagle
of the best quality.

535
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,639
I won't sell it. Not at any price.

536
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:24,025
(Chu Lushan arrived at the Mansion,
asking to see you, Your Highness.)

537
00:39:31,475 --> 00:39:33,159
Chu Lushan asked to see me.

538
00:39:36,675 --> 00:39:38,519
He's one of my father's adopted sons.

539
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:49,440
Go on with the fishing.

540
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:51,425
Your Highness!

541
00:39:51,725 --> 00:39:52,679
Your Highness!

542
00:39:53,175 --> 00:39:54,239
Your Highness!

543
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,000
Your Highness, where are you?

544
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,719
Your Highness!

545
00:39:58,450 --> 00:39:59,800
Your Highness!

546
00:40:00,575 --> 00:40:01,719
Your Highness!

547
00:40:01,975 --> 00:40:02,760
Your Highness!

548
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,650
Your Highness!

549
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,000
Your Highness!

550
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,239
I meet you, at last.

551
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,320
Your Highness.

552
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,275
Your Highness,

553
00:40:10,525 --> 00:40:11,519
in the past three years,

554
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:13,760
I've been thinking of you day and night

555
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,850
with no appetite for anything.

556
00:40:21,525 --> 00:40:22,840
No appetite for anything?

557
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,400
Yes.

558
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,159
But why do I think

559
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:27,725
you're far fatter?

560
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:28,800
I'm sure I'm thinner.

561
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,239
A lot thinner.

562
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:32,050
If you don't believe me,

563
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,375
I'll weigh myself immediately.

564
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,960
If I get one catty heavier,
I'll cut one catty of my flesh off.

565
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,425
If I get ten catties heavier,
I'll cut ten catties of my flesh off.

566
00:40:36,425 --> 00:40:38,159
What do I need your flesh for?

567
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:39,575
You can feed dogs with it.

568
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:41,825
You're indeed a good buddy, General Chu.

569
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:43,440
Call me Fatty Lushan.

570
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,625
That's not appropriate.

571
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,275
Why is it not?

572
00:40:46,425 --> 00:40:48,100
I'm fatty, after all.

573
00:40:51,325 --> 00:40:52,200
Your Highness.

574
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,600
In the past three years,

575
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:56,775
I'm afraid

576
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,239
you've seldom visited the brothels.

577
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,025
What's your point?

578
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,960
There came a new belle in Zijin Brothel.

579
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:11,675
She's gorgeous and talented.

580
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,079
She's especially good at sword dance.

581
00:41:14,675 --> 00:41:15,875
Her elegance...

582
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:17,825
Her appearance...

583
00:41:19,425 --> 00:41:21,600
She's almost
the most beautiful lady in Lingzhou.

584
00:41:22,325 --> 00:41:23,300
She just arrived.

585
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,225
She'll be ready when you are.

586
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,825
She can do sword dance?

587
00:41:29,825 --> 00:41:30,550
Yeah.

588
00:41:31,275 --> 00:41:32,199
Her waist...

589
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:33,599
Her legs...

590
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:35,475
Your Highness, are you available now?

591
00:41:36,975 --> 00:41:38,475
How shall I put it?

592
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,625
What?

593
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:42,400
I came here for fishing.

594
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,850
As I fished,

595
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:45,550
you came.

596
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:46,880
How about...?

597
00:41:47,175 --> 00:41:49,200
How about going there after fishing?

598
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,225
Don't bother.

599
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:51,875
I've got the fish I expected.

600
00:41:56,325 --> 00:41:58,050
Don't visit a brothel, Longxiang.

601
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,719
Come back tonight.

602
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:00,679
I will.

603
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:02,650
I'll have Old Huang
make some grilled fish for dinner.

604
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:05,300
I'd like to catch more fish.

605
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:09,075
Do you mind visiting a brothel?

606
00:42:12,075 --> 00:42:12,920
I don't.

607
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,250
Old Huang, you're old enough.

608
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,400
You'd better not go.

609
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:23,225
Who's this?

610
00:42:23,425 --> 00:42:24,440
My new bodyguard.

611
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,639
Look at her appearance.

612
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:26,575
New bodyguard?

613
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:29,775
You really have a lot of fun.

614
00:42:29,775 --> 00:42:31,000
Don't talk nonsense.

615
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,119
If she beats you,

616
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:32,880
I can't stop her.

617
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:33,559
Let's go.

618
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,440
When I visited Zijin Brothel last time,

619
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,480
the fruit there was stale.

620
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:39,825
Let's not have any fruit there.

621
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,679
I'll take some with us.

622
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:45,840
You're a general of sub-third rank.

623
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
In front of you,

624
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,079
I'm nothing.

625
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:48,850
Don't say that.

626
00:42:49,075 --> 00:42:50,159
You don't need to take the fruit.

627
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:51,375
Let's have someone else go with us.

628
00:42:57,025 --> 00:42:58,450
I'm not going to the brothel.
