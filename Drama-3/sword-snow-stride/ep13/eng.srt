(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:46,860
Who is that?

8
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:48,575
All right.

9
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,050
Old fellow.

10
00:01:50,175 --> 00:01:51,980
Your hearing gets better!

11
00:01:53,275 --> 00:01:54,300
Old brother.

12
00:01:54,575 --> 00:01:55,580
It's you.

13
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,380
Yeah, I'm here.

14
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:57,980
It's the end of the year now.

15
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,820
This government

16
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,660
distributed

17
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,220
some rice

18
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,140
to us.

19
00:02:01,225 --> 00:02:02,700
I brought some here

20
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,660
to surprise you.

21
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,875
Well,

22
00:02:05,275 --> 00:02:06,700
I can escape your eyes,

23
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,275
but I can't escape your ears.

24
00:02:09,775 --> 00:02:10,820
I was just

25
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,750
talking about you with that boy.

26
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,340
Um.

27
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,940
If you came a little earlier,

28
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,350
you would be able to meet him.

29
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,200
Um.

30
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,180
Old brother.

31
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,660
You work in the government.

32
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,175
Just give him a hand

33
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:22,900
if you can.

34
00:02:23,225 --> 00:02:23,925
Well,

35
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,075
he doesn't need my help.

36
00:02:27,325 --> 00:02:29,425
I beg you.

37
00:02:29,725 --> 00:02:30,820
Please.

38
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,500
All right.

39
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,380
Let's not talk about him.

40
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,450
Well,

41
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,580
it's the end of the year.

42
00:02:35,975 --> 00:02:37,180
Tell me

43
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,380
if there is anything you want

44
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:40,900
or you want to do.

45
00:02:41,025 --> 00:02:42,540
I have a regret,

46
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,020
but you can't

47
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,775
help me.

48
00:02:46,075 --> 00:02:46,800
Ah?

49
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,860
Tell me about it.

50
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,540
My only regret

51
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:51,100
in this life

52
00:02:51,175 --> 00:02:53,100
is that I didn't
take a look at General Xu.

53
00:02:54,225 --> 00:02:56,820
At first, the cavalry
only had 600 soldiers.

54
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,620
Now the world is at peace.

55
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,550
I didn't even have a word

56
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,700
with General Xu.

57
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,500
What a pity is that!

58
00:03:06,325 --> 00:03:07,780
Xu Xiao

59
00:03:07,925 --> 00:03:10,825
is an old man with a white beard now.

60
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,525
Don't call General Xu by his name!

61
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:15,075
All right.

62
00:03:15,075 --> 00:03:15,860
Don't get excited.

63
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,500
What's there to be mad about?

64
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,540
Come on. Sit down.

65
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,450
Sit down first.

66
00:03:31,575 --> 00:03:34,325
The cavalryman of the lowest rank

67
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,775
from the 18th Laozi Battalion

68
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:37,900
and Yugu Battalion

69
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:40,200
of Jinzhou

70
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,180
greets General Xu.

71
00:03:44,675 --> 00:03:46,150
Why are you so sure

72
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,260
that I'm Xu Xiao?

73
00:03:47,975 --> 00:03:50,325
After the battle
where I got my eyes hurt,

74
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,550
you came to see the wounded.

75
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,125
You held my hand

76
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,275
and told me

77
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,060
that I must stay alive.

78
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,540
Although I couldn't see,

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,700
I've remembered

80
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,660
your hands for a lifetime.

81
00:04:08,575 --> 00:04:09,540
Old brother, get up.

82
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,150
Come on.

83
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,350
Come on.

84
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,540
Sit down.

85
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,580
General Xu.

86
00:04:20,725 --> 00:04:22,340
If you don't mind me asking,

87
00:04:22,775 --> 00:04:24,780
is that boy Xu your...?

88
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,750
He's my son.

89
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,060
Xu Fengnian.

90
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,940
Congratulations to General Xu.

91
00:04:32,325 --> 00:04:33,700
You and the Consort

92
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,100
gave birth to a good son.

93
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:37,660
I'm content with

94
00:04:38,675 --> 00:04:39,780
my life now.

95
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,740
I have no regrets anymore.

96
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,675
General Xu.

97
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,380
I have one more question.

98
00:04:49,325 --> 00:04:51,400
How many of those old brothers

99
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,820
are still alive?

100
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,340
As long as the flag
of the army of North Liang

101
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,175
doesn't fall,

102
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,060
they are still there.

103
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,825
Then I'll tell them

104
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,700
that there is an inheritor

105
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:29,700
of North Liang.

106
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,425
This flag

107
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,340
will never fall.

108
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,575
Are you still reading on New Year's Eve?

109
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,400
The new year will come anyway

110
00:06:01,825 --> 00:06:02,860
no matter what you do.

111
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,860
It's such a happy day.

112
00:06:05,275 --> 00:06:06,660
Don't be so philosophical.

113
00:06:11,575 --> 00:06:12,700
Where's Grandpa Wei?

114
00:06:13,525 --> 00:06:14,580
He's sleeping on the second floor.

115
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:16,540
Good.

116
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,180
Let's drink.

117
00:06:29,675 --> 00:06:32,175
In previous years, I could see
snow scenes during the New Year.

118
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,650
This year,

119
00:06:34,525 --> 00:06:36,380
I can only have some wine.

120
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:37,425
Come on.

121
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,525
How do you spend the New Year
in North Mang?

122
00:06:55,675 --> 00:06:56,750
Where there are people,

123
00:06:56,975 --> 00:06:57,860
it's all basically the same.

124
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:03,725
The same people spend the same New Year.

125
00:07:04,775 --> 00:07:07,675
But they have to
fight with each other to death.

126
00:07:17,175 --> 00:07:18,540
People and people fight.

127
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,500
Village and village fight.

128
00:07:21,225 --> 00:07:22,600
Town and town fight.

129
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:25,580

00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:40,660
Do you want wine?

193
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,100
Save me a mouthful.

194
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:56,515
You really saved me a mouthful.

195
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,475
Listen.

196
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,380
These are not secret scriptures.

197
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,575
The secret scriptures are up there.

198
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:09,900
Let's go.

199
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,980
I'll take you to find them.

200
00:12:11,425 --> 00:12:12,180
Come on.

201
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,820
Let's go.

202
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,260
Be gentle.

203
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,780
White Fox is sleeping.

204
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,375
Don't wake her up.

205
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,660
And also,

206
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,625
you don't take...

207
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:24,650
Don't take secret scriptures.

208
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,000
Secret scriptures are hard to sell.

209
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:30,180
The antiques and precious stones
are on the fourth floor.

210
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,525
Those things are valuable.

211
00:12:36,025 --> 00:12:38,000
I mean, White Fox is sleeping.

212
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,900
Should I stay by her side?

213
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,290
You have a point.

214
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,020
I need to watch her.

215
00:12:45,925 --> 00:12:48,420
Don't let her throw up on my clothes.

216
00:12:50,175 --> 00:12:51,340
I'm leaving.

217
00:12:51,575 --> 00:12:52,420
Don't take too much.

218
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,300
Don't be too greedy.

219
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,860
It's hard to believe
you are Xu Xiao's son.

220
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,550
Interesting.

221
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,100
What did you say?

222
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,660
What are you doing?

223
00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:28,125
You're awake.

224
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,300
Since you are awake,

225
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,125
I'll go back.

226
00:13:49,525 --> 00:13:50,780
Do you need me to send you back?

227
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,550
No need.

228
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:58,100
No matter how drunk I am,

229
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,475
I can still find

230
00:14:00,775 --> 00:14:02,540
my way back home.

231
00:14:30,975 --> 00:14:32,620
Xu Fengnian!

232
00:14:39,725 --> 00:14:41,660
What are you doing in my room?

233
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,225
This is my room!

234
00:14:47,975 --> 00:14:49,300
It's okay.

235
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,740
I got drunk last night

236
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,900
and went into the wrong room.

237
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,900
Don't worry.

238
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,020
I'll explain it to everyone.

239
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,140
Don't say anything!

240
00:14:58,525 --> 00:14:59,225
Ah?

241
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,825
Don't say anything.

242
00:15:00,825 --> 00:15:02,450
I'll tell everyone it's me...

243
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,300
Get out!

244
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,620
You are too loud.

245
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,980
They must have heard you.

246
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:10,620
Don't you need me to explain it?

247
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,125
- Get out now!
- Let me

248
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,540
put on my shoes.

249
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,475
(The following spring)

250
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:36,125
(Mansion of Lord of North Liang)

251
00:15:39,175 --> 00:15:39,860
My Lord.

252
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,060
Everything is ready.

253
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:42,350
We can leave anytime.

254
00:15:46,525 --> 00:15:47,980
As you required,

255
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,140
Ning Emei

256
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,300
will lead

257
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,700
a cavalry of 100 soldiers
of Fengzi Battalion

258
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,820
to go with you.

259
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:55,740
You will see them

260
00:15:55,925 --> 00:15:57,220
after you set off.

261
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:00,400
Qingniao

262
00:16:00,825 --> 00:16:01,980
will drive the carriage for you.

263
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,600
From now on,

264
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,175
you have to keep it in mind

265
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,250
every word I said.

266
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,655
My Lord.

267
00:16:16,655 --> 00:16:17,260
- Your Highness.
- Um.

268
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,100
Wei Shuyang.

269
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,475
My Lord.

270
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,500
Wei Shuyang

271
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,700
is learned and capable,

272
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,950
especially in terms of

273
00:16:25,075 --> 00:16:26,050
martial arts.

274
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:27,580
You should

275
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,940
rely on him more.

276
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,380
Grandpa Wei, thank you.

277
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,060
Your Highness, you're welcome.

278
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:36,075
Her name is Shu Xiu.

279
00:16:36,275 --> 00:16:37,420
You met her before.

280
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,675
She knows

281
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,050
how the world of martial arts works.

282
00:16:41,175 --> 00:16:42,745
You can ask her

283
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:43,925
in case of any special circumstances.

284
00:16:45,075 --> 00:16:46,600
You can ask me anything.

285
00:16:52,175 --> 00:16:53,400
Be careful.

286
00:16:53,675 --> 00:16:54,375
Um.

287
00:16:55,675 --> 00:16:57,400
Why is there no one by that carriage?

288
00:16:57,825 --> 00:16:59,380
The carriage driver will come soon.

289
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,780
What are you doing inside?

290
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,020
I'll stay with Jiang Ni

291
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:08,750
no matter where she goes.

292
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,800
That's absurd!

293
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,325
Jiang Ni won't come with me.

294
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,190
You are...

295
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:24,325
Which carriage will take me?

296
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:25,825
This one!

297
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:29,900
You planned this?

298
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,100
Yes.

299
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,540
I'm leaving for
the world of martial arts.

300
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,580
Why should I take Jiang Ni?

301
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:34,950
You need

302
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:35,660
someone

303
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,500
to take care of you

304
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:39,620
on the road.

305
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:40,980
There are so many maids.

306
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,800
Why did you pick Jiang Ni?

307
00:17:43,725 --> 00:17:45,700
If you leave Jiang Ni in the mansion,

308
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,900
what if

309
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,250
your second sister's subordinates

310
00:17:49,325 --> 00:17:50,220
try to hurt her again?

311
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,850
That's the only reason?

312
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:58,100
I have to bother you

313
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,380
to take care of Fengnian

314
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,180
during this trip!

315
00:18:03,575 --> 00:18:04,260
Hey!

316
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,300
Don't smear my carriage!

317
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,925
Who is that person?

318
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:09,950
The monster

319
00:18:10,075 --> 00:18:12,050
who was locked
under the Tingchao Pavilion.

320
00:18:12,975 --> 00:18:13,780
By the way,

321
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,900
there is one thing
you must keep in mind.

322
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,860
Never give him a sword.

323
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,300
What kind of sword?

324
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,380
All kinds of swords.

325
00:18:20,575 --> 00:18:21,580
What about a wooden sword?

326
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,725
Not even a wooden sword!

327
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:24,540
Give him a name at least.

328
00:18:26,325 --> 00:18:27,025
Eh.

329
00:18:27,175 --> 00:18:29,140
The other carriage driver is here.

330
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:30,650
Great Sword,

331
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,175
Lyu Qiantang.

332
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,500
You're not Lyu Qiantang!

333
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,180
Aren't you Lin

334
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,340
who tried to assassinate me?

335
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:41,220
I'm Lyu Qiantang.

336
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,100
Greetings to Your Highness.

337
00:18:42,225 --> 00:18:43,500
Your voice doesn't even change!

338
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,420
Don't you lie to me!

339
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,300
(Lyu Qiantang, retainer)
I'm Lyu Qiantang.

340
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,175
(Lyu Qiantang, retainer)
Greetings to Your Highness.

341
00:18:46,675 --> 00:18:47,860
What is going on now?

342
00:18:48,825 --> 00:18:50,975
Your first stop is Qingzhou.

343
00:18:51,075 --> 00:18:52,180
The Lin family in Qingzhou

344
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,140
has been cornered
by the Lord of Jing'an.

345
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,780
It will do you no harm

346
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,300
to let him come with you.

347
00:18:58,825 --> 00:19:00,540
You forced him to yield?

348
00:19:01,275 --> 00:19:03,140
He must yield

349
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,580
if he wants to save the Lin family.

350
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,540
A centipede does not topple over

351
00:19:13,925 --> 00:19:15,085
even when dead.

352
00:19:15,825 --> 00:19:17,550
The Lin family is still lingering on

353
00:19:18,025 --> 00:19:19,300
in Qingzhou.

354
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,925
If you don't want it to perish,

355
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,820
don't forget

356
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,420
what I told you.

357
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:28,625
Yes.

358
00:19:33,925 --> 00:19:35,425
How many things have you planned?

359
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:37,500
Don't worry.

360
00:19:37,975 --> 00:19:39,220
With that old man by your side,

361
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,140
even the world is turned upside down,

362
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,260
he will keep you safe.

363
00:19:43,675 --> 00:19:45,260
Who is that old man?

364
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,180
He will tell you

365
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,500
when he wants.

366
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,660
After you leave,

367
00:19:50,775 --> 00:19:52,040
I will head for the capital.

368
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,580
I'll be in the court, and you'll be
in the world of martial arts.

369
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,025
Only we join forces,

370
00:19:57,025 --> 00:20:00,740
can we preserve
the hereditary system in North Liang.

371
00:20:01,725 --> 00:20:02,400
Um.

372
00:20:03,675 --> 00:20:04,900
Be careful on the road.

373
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:07,580
Go now.

374
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,700
How much more
have you planned along the way?

375
00:20:32,675 --> 00:20:33,950
We hit the road

376
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,980
and embrace whatever comes.

377
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,125
Set off.

378
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,420
You got a letter from North Liang?

379
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,820
What happened?

380
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,900
None of your business.

381
00:21:31,075 --> 00:21:32,350
Don't say that.

382
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:33,820
You and I

383
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,440
will be a family one day.

384
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,900
Your business is my business.

385
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,500
Hongchi?

386
00:21:42,025 --> 00:21:43,540
You have the ancient sword.

387
00:21:44,725 --> 00:21:45,420
Get away.

388
00:21:45,975 --> 00:21:47,250
It's human nature

389
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,750
for men and women to fall in love.

390
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,140
I'm the only one

391
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,660
who is good enough for you

392
00:21:51,775 --> 00:21:52,820
in Shangyin Academy.

393
00:21:53,425 --> 00:21:53,981
Eh?

394
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,980
You should think about it.

395
00:22:21,325 --> 00:22:22,550
Why are you here in person?

396
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,725
Xu Fengnian
is going to leave North Liang.

397
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,600
Oh?

398
00:22:26,075 --> 00:22:28,375
Didn't he just go back
from a three-year tour?

399
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,500
It's not secretive this time.

400
00:22:31,075 --> 00:22:32,625
He is traceable.

401
00:22:32,725 --> 00:22:33,975
He is bold indeed.

402
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:36,900
But,

403
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,375
what does it have to do with me
that he's gonna leave North Liang?

404
00:22:39,975 --> 00:22:40,980
Kill him.

405
00:22:41,325 --> 00:22:42,540
Is it the order of the court?

406
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:44,860
No.

407
00:22:45,225 --> 00:22:46,265
Master.

408
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,725
I have no grievances against him,

409
00:22:49,525 --> 00:22:50,580
and he might become

410
00:22:50,775 --> 00:22:52,940
my brother-in-law one day.

411
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:54,620
If I kill him,

412
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,300
what's in it for me?

413
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,110
If he dies,

414
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,060
North Liang will be in chaos,

415
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,590
and the world will be in chaos.

416
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:03,580
Only when the world is in chaos,

417
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,220
can you have a chance to stand out.

418
00:23:10,325 --> 00:23:11,540
In this case,

419
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:12,820
it's kind of interesting

420
00:23:15,775 --> 00:23:16,860
to kill my brother-in-law.

421
00:23:17,925 --> 00:23:19,100
Without the imperial order,

422
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:21,820
I can't do it myself.

423
00:23:22,175 --> 00:23:24,380
I can only give you some helpers.

424
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,375
(Han Diaosi, the Eunuch Chief of Liyang)

425
00:23:33,175 --> 00:23:34,820
The Fengzi Battalion's cavalry
of 100 soldiers

426
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,220
is waiting ahead.

427
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,860
I thought you would leave me

428
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,620
and head for Mount Longhu

429
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,000
once you are outside Lingzhou.

430
00:23:43,575 --> 00:23:44,740
The military order has been issued.

431
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:46,750
The Fengzi Battalion
will escort you to the east.

432
00:23:47,475 --> 00:23:49,140
You just escort me

433
00:23:49,425 --> 00:23:50,380
when the order says so?

434
00:23:50,725 --> 00:23:51,420
Of course.

435
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:53,060
Orders are orders.

436
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,020
Aren't you going
to get Huangman'er back?

437
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,300
That's not on the military order.

438
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:56,900
After we get to Mount Longhu,

439
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,100
I'll leave the team

440
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,100
and rescue Young Master Longxiang
on my own.

441
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:01,940
Is the cavalry of Fengzi Battalion

442
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,300
waiting ahead on the main road?

443
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,340
Not on the main road.

444
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,380
They are waiting in the woods.

445
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,060
Why?

446
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,220
To avoid disturbing the people

447
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,820
when there is no military order.

448
00:24:08,975 --> 00:24:09,940
Don't you know it?

449
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,580
Then I have to trouble you

450
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,900
to bring them here.

451
00:24:20,075 --> 00:24:21,500
Please stay, Your Highness.

452
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,475
Iron Cavalry.

453
00:24:38,725 --> 00:24:39,820
You are Dian Xiongchu.

454
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,060
(Dian Xiongchu, General of Iron Cavalry)
Please wait a moment, Your Highness.

455
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:44,380
Our general wants
to see you off in person.

456
00:24:44,575 --> 00:24:46,540
I remember you are
Chen Zhibao's subordinate.

457
00:24:46,975 --> 00:24:49,300
Please wait at your ease.

458
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,100
What if I don't want to wait?

459
00:25:05,475 --> 00:25:06,600
You didn't even tell me

460
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,725
that you are leaving.

461
00:25:08,075 --> 00:25:09,975
I'm willing to be at your service,

462
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,925
holding your whip and following
your stirrups, Your Highness.

463
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,350
Dian.

464
00:25:14,975 --> 00:25:15,780
Make way.

465
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,180
General Chu.

466
00:25:17,775 --> 00:25:18,875
I don't think your crossbow

467
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,500
can't shoot through the iron armor
of the Iron Cavalry.

468
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,740
Do you wanna try it?

469
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,180
Young Master Xu is leaving.

470
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,515
Iron Cavalry, make way now!

471
00:25:50,575 --> 00:25:52,375
General Chen asked
Young Master Xu to wait.

472
00:25:53,225 --> 00:25:54,825
The title of the army
of North Liang is Xu,

473
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:55,950
not Chen.

474
00:25:56,625 --> 00:25:57,580
General Ning.

475
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,220
Are you really willing to serve him?

476
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,375
I'm asking you to make way.

477
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:03,300
You can try to charge

478
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,220
if you dare.

479
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,580
Are you done?

480
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,900
Who can afford the charge
of infighting within North Liang?

481
00:26:08,325 --> 00:26:10,220
I'll give you one last chance.

482
00:26:10,475 --> 00:26:11,260
Make way.

483
00:26:12,775 --> 00:26:13,800
Get ready to charge!

484
00:26:14,425 --> 00:26:15,540
Raise your bow!

485
00:26:20,575 --> 00:26:22,420
Aren't you supposed
to protect Xu Fengnian?

486
00:26:22,525 --> 00:26:23,620
I'll go out

487
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,625
when he is dying.

488
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,980
There are battle-hardened
elite soldiers out there.

489
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,100
How many can you stop by yourself?

490
00:26:29,275 --> 00:26:30,475
Thousands of soldiers

491
00:26:30,475 --> 00:26:32,420
are just easy prey to me.

492
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,420
Everyone can brag.

493
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,180
Chen Zhibao.

494
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,750
Be careful.

495
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,420
Don't you know

496
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,900
what will happen if one of my men
releases the arrow?

497
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,380
I just left Lingzhou

498
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,550
and you caught up with me in a hurry.

499
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,250
Are you so eager to kill me?

500
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,250
Dian Xiongchu!

501
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,580
General.

502
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:06,580
Dian Xiongchu can escort you
to the east.

503
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:08,900
I don't think

504
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,025
we are that close.

505
00:27:11,275 --> 00:27:12,540
You can't die now

506
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,580
for North Liang's sake.

507
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,900
Why don't you die first

508
00:27:16,275 --> 00:27:17,740
for North Liang's sake?

509
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,060
It's none of your business.

510
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,100
Young Master Xu's business

511
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:20,780
is my business.

512
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,780
Stop fighting.

513
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,500
I refuse to leave with Iron Cavalry.

514
00:27:25,175 --> 00:27:27,020
Ning Emei's Fengzi Battalion is enough.

515
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,260
He always hates you.

516
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,860
I don't think he will try his best

517
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,950
to protect you.

518
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:34,780
Well, do you and Dian Xiongchu

519
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,100
appreciate me?

520
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,340
With my order,

521
00:27:37,525 --> 00:27:39,125
Dian Xiongchu will use his life

522
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:40,300
to protect you.

523
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,575
No need.

524
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:43,100
Think it through.

525
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,275
It's not safe

526
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,600
to leave North Liang.

527
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,020
Ning Emei.

528
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:50,820
Yes!

529
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,300
Before we get to Mount Longhu,

530
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,820
can you protect my life?

531
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,180
With the military order,

532
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:56,700
as long as there is one soldier alive
in Fengzi Battalion,

533
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,400
you will be fine.

534
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,250
Compared with you,

535
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,200
I trust him more.

536
00:28:04,425 --> 00:28:05,900
Iron Cavalry. Return to the camp.

537
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,275
The heavily armored cavalry left.

538
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,425
Are you worried about that boy?

539
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,825
Who is worried about him?

540
00:28:24,525 --> 00:28:26,000
I'm worried about myself.

541
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:28,020
If the cavalry starts to fight,

542
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,380
you will protect Xu Fengnian.

543
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,325
What about me?

544
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,220
I've decided to take over North Liang.

545
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,275
You are not qualified.

546
00:28:40,275 --> 00:28:41,180
I leave this time

547
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,900
to win myself the heirship.

548
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,450
None of this matters.

549
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,750
You must have three things

550
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,950
before you take over North Liang.

551
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:48,700
One,

552
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:49,660
a cruel heart.

553
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:50,475
Two,

554
00:28:50,525 --> 00:28:51,525
a scheming mind.

555
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:52,385
Three,

556
00:28:52,385 --> 00:28:53,380
connections.

557
00:28:53,725 --> 00:28:54,725
You are not good enough

558
00:28:55,825 --> 00:28:56,900
at any of them.

559
00:28:57,075 --> 00:28:59,300
That's basically what Xu Xiao said.

560
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,300
Can there be something new?

561
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:08,650
What about you?

562
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,020
Are you good enough at
these three things?

563
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,250
He is alone.

564
00:29:30,425 --> 00:29:31,620
How about we...

565
00:29:32,025 --> 00:29:33,740
I kind of appreciate him.

566
00:29:34,275 --> 00:29:35,660
There is something about that guy.

567
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,050
That's why you can't keep him.

568
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,050
Don't mess around.

569
00:29:38,725 --> 00:29:39,750
Your Highness.

570
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:41,700
You shouldn't have told him

571
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,540
about the heirship.

572
00:29:42,775 --> 00:29:44,600
You can't hide things like that.

573
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,650
Telling it now

574
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,540
can help North Liang

575
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,580
and the capital

576
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,540
prepare in advance.

577
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:50,380
Go back.

578
00:29:51,775 --> 00:29:54,275
I'll escort you to leave North Liang.

579
00:29:54,875 --> 00:29:56,100
Xu Xiao will leave for the capital soon.

580
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,260
You can protect him at that time.

581
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,060
Really?

582
00:29:58,325 --> 00:29:59,260
It's settled.

583
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,660
I got it.

584
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,525
Be careful, Your Highness.

585
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,225
Let's set off.

586
00:30:48,675 --> 00:30:49,580
What are you looking at?

587
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,140
You have good qualifications.

588
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,940
Do you want to learn
something useful from me?

589
00:30:55,825 --> 00:30:56,540
No.

590
00:30:56,675 --> 00:30:57,825
Why not?

591
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,340
The fools

592
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,500
who wanted to be my apprentices before

593
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,500
could line up for North Liang
to the East Sea.

594
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,925
Only fools wanted
to be your apprentices?

595
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:09,150
Do you know who I am?

596
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:12,500
Why should I care?

597
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,800
You have a point.

598
00:31:18,475 --> 00:31:19,900
I almost forgot

599
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,050
who I am.

600
00:31:21,575 --> 00:31:24,200
Who else would remember Mumaniu?

601
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:04,400
This one is really big...

602
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:07,900
You finally got one!
But you let it escape!

603
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,900
You tried to kill me
last time when we met.

604
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,180
Now you are my guard.

605
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:43,600
You'll get used to it.

606
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:49,125
I remember
it wasn't this sword last time.

607
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,620
This sword

608
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,500
is called Chixia.

609
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:53,900
Grand Commander gave it to me.

610
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:56,940
You are a scholar.

611
00:32:58,175 --> 00:32:59,700
Scholars can also use swords.

612
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,380
Scholars are unpredictable.

613
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,740
Maybe you will

614
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,900
stab me with a sword again one day.

615
00:33:05,075 --> 00:33:06,340
Only when you are alive,

616
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,940
Grand Commander will give my family

617
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,220
the last chance to live.

618
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:19,425
How is the Lin family now?

619
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,750
The mansion has been ransacked
by the Lord of Jing'an.

620
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:40,475
Then you should beg the Lord of Jing'an.

621
00:33:40,775 --> 00:33:42,400
What's the use to turn to Xu Xiao?

622
00:33:53,175 --> 00:33:55,925
You don't know
how horrible your father is.

623
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,140
Even he changed his name,

624
00:34:06,525 --> 00:34:07,925
his surname will always be Lin.

625
00:34:09,725 --> 00:34:10,725
What are you trying to say?

626
00:34:11,025 --> 00:34:12,540
There is a danger

627
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,620
of keeping such a person by your side.

628
00:34:15,775 --> 00:34:17,100
I have looked into his eyes.

629
00:34:17,525 --> 00:34:19,020
He can even give up his life.

630
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:21,020
It won't do any difference
whether I kill him or not.

631
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,020
He is dead inside.

632
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:25,725
I'll keep an eye on him

633
00:34:26,275 --> 00:34:27,660
for you, Your Highness.

634
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,150
Your Highness.

635
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,125
Why don't you go inside?

636
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,980
I'll keep watch before midnight.

637
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,150
No need.

638
00:34:40,225 --> 00:34:41,500
The Fengzi Battalion camped near us.

639
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,325
It's safe.

640
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:43,400
It's better not

641
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,600
to trust others with our lives.

642
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,325
Who will guard here after the midnight?

643
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:53,450
Um.

644
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,340
We have left Lingzhou.

645
00:35:12,225 --> 00:35:13,175
I know.

646
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:15,260
Now that we are out of North Liang,

647
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,675
we have a chance now.

648
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,600
What chance?

649
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,125
To run away.

650
00:35:23,825 --> 00:35:24,800
Where?

651
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,140
Anywhere is better than here.

652
00:35:28,725 --> 00:35:29,875
Have you ever thought about

653
00:35:30,175 --> 00:35:31,780
why Xu Xiao picked you

654
00:35:32,025 --> 00:35:34,420
to follow Xu Fengnian in this trip?

655
00:35:35,725 --> 00:35:37,650
What's the worst that can happen to you?

656
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,400
I die.

657
00:35:40,175 --> 00:35:40,950
Yeah.

658
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:42,980
Maybe you will die.

659
00:35:46,075 --> 00:35:48,060
Xu Xiao killed so many people.

660
00:35:48,775 --> 00:35:50,420
Why does he keep me alive?

661
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,150
The Princess of Chu's life
is still quite useful

662
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,550
at the crucial moment.

663
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:56,540
He wants to kill you?

664
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,980
Not to kill me,

665
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,020
but to change my life for something.

666
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:03,500
Where's Jiang Ni?

667
00:36:06,225 --> 00:36:07,375
Where are you from?

668
00:36:17,225 --> 00:36:19,175
You have to do something about it.

669
00:36:19,175 --> 00:36:20,725
I'm reading now.

670
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:22,575
What's the use of reading?

671
00:36:22,575 --> 00:36:24,200
Can you acquire martial arts
in such a short time?

672
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,940
I charge for reading.

673
00:36:26,275 --> 00:36:29,340
I can get seven strings of pennies
after I read this book.

674
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,940
How can you still
think about making money

675
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,620
at this time?

676
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:34,500
You know

677
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:37,220
the funeral custom in Chu
is complicated.

678
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,350
A funeral will cost a lot.

679
00:36:40,725 --> 00:36:42,180
I've been thinking

680
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,300
that I have no relatives and no family,

681
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,850
and my state fell.

682
00:36:46,975 --> 00:36:48,060
If I don't even

683
00:36:48,175 --> 00:36:50,140
have a funeral after I die,

684
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,420
won't it be too pitiful?

685
00:36:53,325 --> 00:36:55,420
You want to make money

686
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:56,380
to...

687
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,820
To hold myself a funeral.

688
00:37:04,175 --> 00:37:06,700
But why are you
trying to kill Xu Fengnian?

689
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:08,700
You hate the Xu family?

690
00:37:09,425 --> 00:37:10,220
No.

691
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:13,450
What else could it be?

692
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,250
Because...

693
00:37:17,725 --> 00:37:18,740
His Highness wants to see you.

694
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,300
It's finally time to read.

695
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,010
I'll go with you.

696
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,500
He only wants to see Jiang Ni.

697
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,850
I put my money box in the tent.

698
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,660
I'll guard it for you.

699
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:44,860
Do you need me to read?

700
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,700
Yes.

701
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,025
Not this one.

702
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,175
Get those books in the carriage.

703
00:37:50,325 --> 00:37:52,200
But I've been reading it for days.

704
00:37:52,725 --> 00:37:54,625
It doesn't count
if you didn't read it to me.

705
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,900
One penny for each word.

706
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,700
I'll pay you after you finish it.

707
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,540
Don't you think it smells bad?

708
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,420
Yes.

709
00:38:09,575 --> 00:38:11,075
I'm kind of uncomfortable
after staying in the carriage all day.

710
00:38:11,725 --> 00:38:13,340
There is hot water by the bonfire.

711
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,740
Wash your hands and feet by yourself.

712
00:38:14,975 --> 00:38:15,660
Me?

713
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,275
Don't come back until you are clean!

714
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,625
Which one?

715
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,100
Read this one first.

716
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:30,150
Compendium of Swords.

717
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,820
(The Prologue of Compendium of Swords)
Sword is the head of all weapons.

718
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,340
It's made to kill.

719
00:38:37,425 --> 00:38:38,940
At the beginning of everything,

720
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,540
there was gold falling from the sky.

721
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,275
An ancient immortal got it

722
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,140
and refined it into steel.

723
00:38:44,475 --> 00:38:46,060
That was the first sword in the world.

724
00:38:46,525 --> 00:38:48,925
It was the gathering of water and fire,

725
00:38:49,075 --> 00:38:50,860
the mixture of Yin and Yang,

726
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:52,940
somewhere in between
rigidity and softness.

727
00:38:53,225 --> 00:38:54,820
Divide the mountains with strength.

728
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,940
Heaven and earth perished.

729
00:38:57,325 --> 00:39:00,060
The sword works by impaling bodies.

730
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,540
The so-called Dancing Sleeves
Whisking the Pear Blossoms,

731
00:39:02,675 --> 00:39:04,260
the Flying Snow,

732
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:05,980
the Fleeing Time,

733
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,350
the Horse Back,

734
00:39:08,925 --> 00:39:11,100
are all the manifestations
of the skills.

735
00:39:11,225 --> 00:39:12,980
The skills can be taught easily,

736
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,540
but the art of martial arts
is unspeakable.

737
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:17,675
10, 15.

738
00:39:18,325 --> 00:39:20,800
20, 25.

739
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,150
30.

740
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:23,250
Keep reading.

741
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,350
Let me count how many words I've read.

742
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:26,775
You can count together after you finish.

743
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,960
55.

744
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:28,790
60.

745
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:29,688
65.

746
00:39:29,688 --> 00:39:30,825
70, 75.

747
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,275
80, 85.

748
00:39:32,275 --> 00:39:34,650
90, 95.

749
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,725
100 pennies for 100 words.

750
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,580
There are 97 words.

751
00:39:42,975 --> 00:39:44,580
Where are the three more?

752
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,050
Just three more words!

753
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,140
Why are you so stingy?

754
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,780
I'm the one who pays the money.

755
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,180
Fine, 97!

756
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,140
I'll keep reading.

757
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:58,300
Being cautious leads to weakness.

758
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,820
The meaning is deep.

759
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,475
The art of martial arts
has different styles

760
00:40:01,475 --> 00:40:02,825
and can be divided into Yin and Yang.

761
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,580
Cultivate the spirit and be righteous.

762
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,850
The internal force will come into being.

763
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:07,620
Breathe in and breathe out
in a solid way.

764
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,125
There is no boundary.

765
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:10,775
All crap!

766
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,500
This book can mislead learners.

767
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,660
It's full of absurdity.

768
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,020
Do you know this book?

769
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,380
It's Compendium of Swords.

770
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,375
When Du Sicong wrote this book,

771
00:40:22,425 --> 00:40:23,940
he wanted to put aside the skills

772
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,260
and seek for the art of swordsmanship.

773
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:27,125
Unfortunately, he was inadequate

774
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,540
and the book is biased.

775
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:31,180
I scolded him
when he was writing the book.

776
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,820
It's a pity
that he still went the wrong way.

777
00:40:34,075 --> 00:40:36,580
Du Sicong who wrote
the Compendium of Swords

778
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:38,580
was scolded by you?

779
00:40:38,675 --> 00:40:40,060
He came to me for advice

780
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:42,150
and stood in the snow
for three days and three nights.

781
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,740
Then I reluctantly

782
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,125
gave him a few words.

783
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:46,500
Brag as you want.

784
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,260
His Compendium of Swords

785
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,625
was collected in the Arsenal of Liyang.

786
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,500
If you are that good,
you can write one yourself.

787
00:40:52,675 --> 00:40:54,180
I've always been alone.

788
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,140
There are countless ideas in my mind,

789
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,350
but I disdain to write them down.

790
00:40:58,575 --> 00:40:59,580
You are still bragging.

791
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,950
Stop doing it.

792
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,340
I'll keep reading.

793
00:41:04,275 --> 00:41:05,260
Since Senior

794
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,875
said so,

795
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:10,500
try the Sword Mantra of Killing Whales.

796
00:41:13,075 --> 00:41:14,700
The Sword Mantra of Killing Whales.

797
00:41:15,725 --> 00:41:17,180
Thousands of miles under the sea,

798
00:41:17,275 --> 00:41:18,900
a living beast

799
00:41:19,075 --> 00:41:20,580
rides the tide

800
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,175
with the sound of thunder

801
00:41:22,175 --> 00:41:24,660
and a heart unafraid of the sword.

802
00:41:24,725 --> 00:41:27,220
In spite of the giant waves,

803
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:28,940
it gets killed
at one slash of the sword.

804
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,540
It's a good idea,

805
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,020
but the mantra is too weak

806
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,300
for such a grand scene.

807
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,875
This book is worse than the last one.

808
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,650
All right.

809
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,775
Let's change another one.

810
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:40,220
This one.

811
00:41:40,775 --> 00:41:42,740
Jiazi's Sword Practice Records
at Lyushui Pavilion.

812
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,300
It's a swordsmanship brochure
given by Wang Chonglou to me.

813
00:41:44,375 --> 00:41:46,180
It's about the sword techniques.

814
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,780
You haven't mastered Dahuangting.

815
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,420
What's the use of practicing this?

816
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,820
Treatise of the Most Exalted One.

817
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,980
There was something
undefined and complete,

818
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,940
coming into existence
before Heaven and Earth.

819
00:41:57,075 --> 00:41:59,100
How still it was and formless.

820
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,500
The way to use the internal force
resides in the framework of Wudang.

821
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:04,100
If you want to turn Dahuangting
into your own internal force,

822
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:06,100
you have to figure out
how to do it yourself.

823
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,700
It makes sense.

824
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,420
Stop reading.

825
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:14,325
I'll read a different one?

826
00:42:14,325 --> 00:42:15,180
That's it for today.

827
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:17,620
I just read a few words.

828
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,820
Let me count it.

829
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:20,824
20.

830
00:42:22,925 --> 00:42:25,025
195 words.

831
00:42:26,275 --> 00:42:28,540
195 pennies.

832
00:42:38,175 --> 00:42:39,250
Smelly old man!

833
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,500
I washed my feet!

834
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,940
You are so talkative!

835
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,500
Otherwise, I could read several books!

836
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,725
You should count how much you owe me!

837
00:42:45,725 --> 00:42:47,150
I don't have any money.
