1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,860
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,220
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,460
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:12,020
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

5
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,980
=Sword Snow Stride=
(Season 1)

6
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,380
=Episode 15=

7
00:01:34,223 --> 00:01:36,383
(Mount Qingcheng Qingyang Sect)

8
00:02:03,475 --> 00:02:04,900
Where's Wu Lingsu?

9
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,250
Look at the stone tablet.

10
00:02:09,025 --> 00:02:10,600
It's the handwriting
of the late emperor.

11
00:02:11,225 --> 00:02:13,350
(Dismount from Horse)
No matter who you are,

12
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,475
get off your horses.

13
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:17,300
The calligraphy is poorly written.

14
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,700
Presumptuous.

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,780
Take position.

16
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,450
Shenxiao Sword Array.

17
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:41,100
Who would like to break it?

18
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,425
Maybe someone else.

19
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,500
He can't break the array.

20
00:04:04,675 --> 00:04:06,350
He surprises me.

21
00:04:07,725 --> 00:04:09,580
The move he used was Chixia.

22
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,025
Is it a sophisticated move?

23
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
I doubt it.

24
00:04:14,575 --> 00:04:15,825
It only works

25
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,060
by exhausting qi and blood.

26
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:19,350
The more he uses it,
the more badly he gets hurt.

27
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,250
People who practice the move

28
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:21,450
don't live long.

29
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,650
How did he learn it?

30
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,800
His Lordship taught him.

31
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,450
Did Xu Xiao trick him?

32
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,220
Doesn't he know

33
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,900
the move may take his life?

34
00:05:11,275 --> 00:05:12,075
He knows.

35
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,325
Have you made up your mind?

36
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,700
Though the swordplay

37
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,625
is powerful,

38
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,260
people who practice it

39
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,550
die quickly.

40
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,580
As long as I can exchange
a slim chance of survival for Lin Family

41
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,860
with my life,

42
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,900
I'm willing to die

43
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:35,800
thousands of times.

44
00:05:36,975 --> 00:05:37,820
Give him.

45
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:48,200
(Chixia Swordplay)

46
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,150
Let's bet

47
00:06:09,225 --> 00:06:11,140
how long can he hold out.

48
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,025
My guess is

49
00:06:14,825 --> 00:06:16,000
two hours.

50
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,500
Give him a hand.

51
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:23,475
Me?

52
00:06:29,575 --> 00:06:30,850
If Your Highness

53
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:32,375
says so.

54
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:42,980
- Despicable.
- Despicable.

55
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,860
He has to fight all of you
by himself,

56
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,025
yet you think we're despicable?

57
00:06:47,025 --> 00:06:48,025
I don't think it's fair.

58
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,850
It was Yuxiao Array just now.

59
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,475
Now it's the real

60
00:07:41,475 --> 00:07:42,800
Shenxiao Sword Array.

61
00:07:43,675 --> 00:07:44,450
It's powerful.

62
00:07:45,175 --> 00:07:46,500
Only God of Sword

63
00:07:46,775 --> 00:07:47,750
can break it.

64
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,250
Don't you take action?

65
00:07:54,525 --> 00:07:56,100
I will if you take me as your master.

66
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,350
Forget it.

67
00:08:04,725 --> 00:08:06,250
Let me try.

68
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,060
Your Highness.

69
00:08:07,175 --> 00:08:08,060
Your Highness.

70
00:08:09,075 --> 00:08:10,450
Don't put yourself at risk.

71
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,300
I made the trouble.

72
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,575
I can't just look on.

73
00:08:16,675 --> 00:08:18,300
I'll fight with you.

74
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,300
Your Highness.

75
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,780
The dead and wounded
have been sent back.

76
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,500
Fengzi Battalion report for duty.

77
00:08:31,225 --> 00:08:32,450
Just in time.

78
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,975
Stone tablet left by the late emperor.

79
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,780
World-famous Shenxiao Sword Array.

80
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,825
Dare you break it with me?

81
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,340
Take position.

82
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,575
Who are you, if I may ask?

83
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,600
Xu Fengnian.

84
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,140
Son of Lord of North Liang?

85
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,340
(Mount Qingcheng)
We're in Qingcheng instead of North Liang.

86
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,150
You invaded our place.

87
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,100
What do you want?

88
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,750
There is a bandit called Old Meng,

89
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,780
a little girl called Xiaoque'er

90
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,650
and a bunch of bandits
following Old Meng.

91
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,300
I must find them all,

92
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,225
no matter dead or alive.

93
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,975
We've never seen them.

94
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,100
I have nothing to say, then.

95
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,660
Mr. Xu.

96
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,050
Xiaoque'er.

97
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,650
Wu Lingsu, Lord of Qingcheng.

98
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,980
You've come all the way.

99
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,950
Why don't you come with me

100
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,800
(Lord of Qingcheng Wu Lingsu)
to enjoy the mountain scenery?

101
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,450
Fine.

102
00:10:11,425 --> 00:10:12,540
You can

103
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,400
come alone.

104
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,900
Please don't.

105
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,300
OK.

106
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,625
I'll go by myself.

107
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:28,870
You've had a long day.

108
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,220
You can retire now.

109
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,075
We haven't arrived in Qingzhou yet.

110
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:34,500
You can't die.

111
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:36,100
Of course.

112
00:10:51,925 --> 00:10:53,100
Get ready.

113
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,150
If anything goes wrong,

114
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,475
(Mount Qingcheng)

115
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,175
flatten the mountain.

116
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,660
Is he out of his mind?

117
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,650
He goes alone, really?

118
00:11:07,525 --> 00:11:08,625
Girl,

119
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,850
aren't you worried?

120
00:11:13,775 --> 00:11:15,300
He is a hundred percent safe.

121
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,500
Why should I be worried?

122
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,700
Are you sure I will save him?

123
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,820
I'll bet you 500 coins

124
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,060
that without your help,

125
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,900
Xu Fengnian still can
get out of the jaws of danger.

126
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,020
He hasn't mastered the skill
of using his blade.

127
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,380
He can't do that.

128
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,400
Do you bet?

129
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:35,350
Yes.

130
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,425
Shall we sneak in?

131
00:11:43,475 --> 00:11:44,225
Here we are.

132
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,425
Xiaoque'er.

133
00:12:03,825 --> 00:12:04,800
Go inside first.

134
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,425
You surprised me.

135
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,700
Your Highness,

136
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,100
you dare come in.

137
00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:29,600
Turn them over to me now.

138
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,100
You ran the risk of

139
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,350
provoking Qingyang Sect
just for the village girl?

140
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,575
Make your bargains.

141
00:12:36,475 --> 00:12:39,025
Were the man and woman
who broke the array

142
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,525
your guards?

143
00:12:40,925 --> 00:12:42,450
They showed no respect to us.

144
00:12:42,725 --> 00:12:44,020
I want them to die.

145
00:12:44,075 --> 00:12:44,750
Fine.

146
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,860
Give me what I want.

147
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,025
I'll turn them over to you.

148
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,460
I want you to go out now

149
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,475
and take their heads to me.

150
00:12:51,825 --> 00:12:53,325
That's not the deal.

151
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,150
I'm not making a deal with you.

152
00:12:56,925 --> 00:12:58,725
Once you come to my place,

153
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,580
your life is in my hands.

154
00:13:01,175 --> 00:13:02,600
You have no choice.

155
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,325
He didn't fall for the trap.

156
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,675
What do you think he would do?

157
00:13:09,225 --> 00:13:10,300
What he would do?

158
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,675
Fight, if he fails to make a deal.

159
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,540
Dare he fight against him?

160
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,940
What's there to fear?

161
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,060
It's Wu Lingsu who will find it hard

162
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,620
being on thin ice.

163
00:13:38,525 --> 00:13:39,540
Do you want to die?

164
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,175
I'll give you a chance.

165
00:13:41,175 --> 00:13:42,140
Bring them to me.

166
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,450
But your life

167
00:13:43,825 --> 00:13:45,275
is in my hands now.

168
00:13:45,975 --> 00:13:47,620
Fengzi Battalion is waiting
outside your gate.

169
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,300
Everyone saw me

170
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,540
coming with you.

171
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,700
To kill me,

172
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,600
you'd better think

173
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,980
if you're capable of
killing all my men first.

174
00:13:55,525 --> 00:13:56,700
As long as one of them escapes,

175
00:13:57,225 --> 00:13:58,980
Xu Xiao will
lead North Liang Cavalry here

176
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,220
to flatten the mountain.

177
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,380
After killing you,

178
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,940
I'll return to the capital immediately.

179
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,700
I don't think Xu Xiao

180
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,460
can catch up with me.

181
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,460
He doesn't have to.

182
00:14:07,825 --> 00:14:09,860
Your family will be turned over
to North Liang.

183
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,550
You're lying!

184
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,020
They'll trade your family's life

185
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,060
for Xu Xiao's retreat.

186
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,475
It gains ten thousand percent.

187
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,325
You lose.

188
00:14:26,675 --> 00:14:28,620
You knew it in the very beginning?

189
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,625
It's easy to guess.

190
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,950
How dare they

191
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,340
kill the son of Lord of North Liang
in public?

192
00:14:35,725 --> 00:14:37,460
Does he come alone because

193
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,650
he has nothing to fear?

194
00:14:38,925 --> 00:14:39,600
Yeah.

195
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,220
He is too cunning

196
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,740
to risk his own life.

197
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,750
I didn't expect you
to be his bosom friend.

198
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,660
Nonsense.

199
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,740
You owe me 500 coins.

200
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,450
You deserve your reputation.

201
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,300
Lubricious reputation?

202
00:14:54,825 --> 00:14:56,620
No wonder she keeps praising you.

203
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,500
Who do you mean?

204
00:14:58,650 --> 00:14:59,580
What are you talking about?

205
00:14:59,925 --> 00:15:00,580
OK.

206
00:15:02,225 --> 00:15:03,620
Bring them to me.

207
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,020
You can tell people in the capital

208
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,340
that I bullied you.

209
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,540
The royal family won't blame you.

210
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,140
No hurry.

211
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,550
Someone wants to see you.

212
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,300
Old Meng isn't dead, is he?

213
00:15:14,575 --> 00:15:15,600
You're far-sighted

214
00:15:15,975 --> 00:15:16,950
with iron nerves.

215
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,950
You're great.

216
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,550
Aunt.

217
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,860
Fengnian.

218
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,050
Aunt.

219
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,380
Zhao Yutai.

220
00:15:38,075 --> 00:15:38,860
Do you know her?

221
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,540
I had been hiding under
Tingchao Pavilion for years.

222
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,550
Whenever Xu Xiao and his wife
went to see me,

223
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,780
she stood by their side.

224
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,550
Does she work for Xu Xiao?

225
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,820
Do you know Xu Fengnian's mother?

226
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,340
Yeah.

227
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,554
She was the first person
in the mansion of Lord of North Liang

228
00:15:53,554 --> 00:15:55,180
who smiled at me.

229
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,975
I still remember her.

230
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,725
His mother's surname was Wu.

231
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:00,100
She came from the Wu family,

232
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,620
who was the last sword champion.

233
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:03,675
The sword masters of the family

234
00:16:03,675 --> 00:16:05,650
all have their own swordsmen,

235
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,780
who grew up with their masters.

236
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,980
In that case,

237
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,980
she was the Consort's swordsman?

238
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,060
She was a sister

239
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:17,650
rather than a swordsman to her.

240
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,050
No wonder he called her Aunt.

241
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,050
Don't be sad.

242
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,450
(Sword Tomb of the Wu family)
I'm not sad.

243
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,500
(Swordsman Zhao Yutai)

244
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,460
I'm happy.

245
00:16:28,225 --> 00:16:29,660
After my mother died,

246
00:16:30,275 --> 00:16:31,580
you got disappeared.

247
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,900
Have you been imprisoned here
by him ever since?

248
00:16:37,175 --> 00:16:38,500
He's my husband.

249
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,700
Then...

250
00:16:44,325 --> 00:16:45,580
Why did he do this to me?

251
00:16:46,925 --> 00:16:48,250
During your travel,

252
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:49,940
you made many friends.

253
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,000
With your status,

254
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,580
you've been watched by many people.

255
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,860
Those with ulterior motives
may use your friends against you.

256
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,750
I took them to Qingyang Sect

257
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,100
in order to protect them.

258
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,340
That's right, Mr. Xu.

259
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,780
They're very kind to me.

260
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:07,940
Then...

261
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,500
Where is Old Meng?

262
00:17:12,025 --> 00:17:13,395
They've been sent to

263
00:17:13,395 --> 00:17:14,660
North Liang.

264
00:17:14,925 --> 00:17:15,780
Now,

265
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,180
they have land.

266
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,620
They're doing very well.

267
00:17:18,725 --> 00:17:20,540
Master said I'm talented.

268
00:17:20,675 --> 00:17:23,180
I'm a disciple of Shenxiao Sect, too.

269
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,500
Have you taken my aunt as your master?

270
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:27,060
Her master is your uncle.

271
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,725
Well...

272
00:17:29,725 --> 00:17:32,100
Wasn't he granted as Lord of Qingcheng?

273
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,425
Qingyang Sect has been hostile
to North Liang over the years.

274
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,060
Isn't it real?

275
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,260
It's our plot.

276
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,500
We keep an eye on the capital
for North Liang.

277
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,140
Does Xu Xiao know it?

278
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,900
Of course.

279
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,930
You have a good talk.

280
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,225
I'll look around

281
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,860
in case anyone will see you.

282
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,580
Mr. Xu,

283
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,980
see you later.

284
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,780
If anything I've been doing these years

285
00:18:03,975 --> 00:18:05,340
leaks out,

286
00:18:05,525 --> 00:18:07,200
it will cause a great disturbance.

287
00:18:08,325 --> 00:18:10,100
General dares not tell anybody

288
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,300
for fearing it might put me in danger.

289
00:18:12,475 --> 00:18:13,860
What a big plan.

290
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,000
Qingyang Sect is actually on our side.

291
00:18:17,475 --> 00:18:19,180
In the future, when our cavalry
come out of North Liang,

292
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:20,940
they'll meet no obstacle
at Mount Qingcheng.

293
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,340
It won't strangle our throat again.

294
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,650
Except for Qingyang Sect,

295
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,220
I'm doing

296
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,220
more important things.

297
00:18:32,925 --> 00:18:35,180
Is there anything more important?

298
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,100
These years,

299
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,980
I've been investigating

300
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,180
your mother's murderer.

301
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:43,780
Ah.

302
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:44,620
Who?

303
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,140
Go, quickly.

304
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:47,900
Aunt, don't worry.

305
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,850
They're with me.

306
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,540
I don't care about

307
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,540
what happened to your family.

308
00:18:56,275 --> 00:18:57,660
Why are you there?

309
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,550
It's the old man's fault.

310
00:19:00,825 --> 00:19:01,550
Ah.

311
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,140
Is there a ladder?

312
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,260
I'm going down now.

313
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,100
Jiang Ni.

314
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,100
A maid of mine.

315
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,580
Maid?

316
00:19:11,425 --> 00:19:12,340
Like a concubine?

317
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,140
No.

318
00:19:13,275 --> 00:19:14,340
No!

319
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,425
(Mount Qingcheng)
He hasn't come out yet.

320
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,140
Shall we go in?

321
00:19:22,325 --> 00:19:23,100
There's no need.

322
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:26,100
God of Sword and Jiang Ni
are no longer in the carriage.

323
00:19:29,725 --> 00:19:30,740
You mean...

324
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,220
They are already in probably.

325
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:36,300
Good.

326
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,100
God of Sword

327
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,540
will ensure his safety.

328
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,020
Which one do you mean?

329
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,620
Is there another God of Sword?

330
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,260
The one armed man, Li Chungang.

331
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:48,820
Isn't he dead yet?

332
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,140
Not yet.

333
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,340
Excuse me, sir.

334
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,175
I didn't mean that.

335
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,860
Sir, may I ask

336
00:20:03,425 --> 00:20:04,425
where is His Highness?

337
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:05,660
Inside.

338
00:20:07,775 --> 00:20:09,150
Then why did you come out?

339
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,700
I had too much breakfast.

340
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,200
I'm a little sleepy.
Let me take a nap first.

341
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,380
Don't worry.

342
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,820
I left Jiang Ni there.

343
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,775
What's the use of Jiang Ni?

344
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,625
Since Mr. Li is back,

345
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
I don't think there would be
any serious danger.

346
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:43,140
I'll retire, then.

347
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:43,780
You don't have to.

348
00:20:44,925 --> 00:20:45,820
Aunt, go ahead.

349
00:20:46,075 --> 00:20:47,380
You can tell her anything
concerning me.

350
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,820
You just said

351
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,540
you've been investigating
my mother's murderer.

352
00:20:52,225 --> 00:20:52,940
Yes.

353
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,460
I've been doing that

354
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,380
since her death.

355
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,500
Did you find anything?

356
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,300
When your mother died,

357
00:21:04,425 --> 00:21:06,075
General and I

358
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,580
found she was seriously wounded.

359
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,225
But she

360
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:12,025
wouldn't tell us the murderer.

361
00:21:12,225 --> 00:21:13,450
The murderer must be powerful.

362
00:21:14,025 --> 00:21:15,950
My mother didn't want us
to take revenge for her.

363
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,580
Over the years,

364
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,180
I investigated the date step by step

365
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,325
and examined the cause of her death.

366
00:21:23,275 --> 00:21:24,575
I can probably guess

367
00:21:24,975 --> 00:21:26,300
when she was wounded.

368
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,420
She once

369
00:21:28,825 --> 00:21:30,140
went to the capital alone.

370
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:31,900
She might

371
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,860
get wounded during the trip.

372
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,900
When was it exactly?

373
00:21:38,175 --> 00:21:40,100
She was pregnant with you
at the time.

374
00:21:41,975 --> 00:21:43,575
The murderer was in the capital.

375
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,225
Have you found who it was?

376
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:47,820
Not yet.

377
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,540
I couldn't find anything.

378
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,780
But the result

379
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,420
is very illustrative itself.

380
00:21:54,175 --> 00:21:55,940
The murderer must be powerful enough

381
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,740
to erase all the clues in the capital.

382
00:22:00,025 --> 00:22:01,825
General asked me to

383
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,540
spread rumors

384
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,100
in Qingcheng

385
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:06,600
of your uncle being lecherous.

386
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:08,540
What's his plan?

387
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,900
He also asked me to pass some words.

388
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:14,600
He said,

389
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,175
you don't want to
take over North Liang

390
00:22:17,175 --> 00:22:18,340
in his way.

391
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,020
Yes.

392
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:21,660
Did you kill

393
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,025
those mountain bandits?

394
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,450
Yes.

395
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,250
If it were him,

396
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,100
he would also kill them

397
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,860
to avenge the dead.

398
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,575
Did he arrange that?

399
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,700
Yes.

400
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,400
The government surrounded them
from all sides

401
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,575
to force them to Qingcheng.

402
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,175
Those bandits

403
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,400
were sent to test your ability.

404
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,400
General also guessed

405
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,300
you would break into the palace alone.

406
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,725
He said in advance that

407
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,460
your mind and means

408
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,250
were very much like his.

409
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,000
He said you wanted to take a new path.

410
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,275
But in the end,

411
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,100
you still took the path
he had paved for you.

412
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,250
I know

413
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,775
you blamed him

414
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,425
on refusing to investigate
your mother's death.

415
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,900
But you must understand

416
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,325
it involves too many people.

417
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,975
We must keep it secret.

418
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,300
I know.

419
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,375
General said

420
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,925
you were unwilling to kill,

421
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,250
but it turned out

422
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,075
when it was time to kill,

423
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,675
you wouldn't hesitate.

424
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,025
You and General

425
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,350
are just alike.

426
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,050
No.

427
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,925
I'm not like him.

428
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,700
I won't sacrifice my family.

429
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,050
It isn't my place

430
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,975
to get involved between you.

431
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,620
But General told me,

432
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,875
when you come up the mountain,

433
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,925
I must tell you all the clues I've found

434
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,100
during the investigation.

435
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,125
From now on,
no matter how many years it takes,

436
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,775
even if General and I are dead,

437
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,425
you must follow up

438
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,700
and avenge your mother.

439
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,325
I'll follow up

440
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,950
even if he doesn't ask me to.

441
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,800
Please wait a minute.

442
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,740
I'll get you something.

443
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:12,800
OK.

444
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,200
You hold on too tight.

445
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,025
Does it hurt?

446
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,025
No.

447
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,375
I'm sorry.

448
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,575
Why didn't you remind me?

449
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,950
Your mother was a nice person.

450
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,175
I remember when I first
got to the mansion,

451
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,925
I was scared and sad.

452
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,025
It was her gentleness

453
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,475
that comforted me
during the most difficult times.

454
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,425
Xu Fengnian.

455
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,075
I'd like to
avenge your mother with you.

456
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:14,380
But we're still bitter rivals.

457
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,275
Here are all the clues

458
00:25:31,825 --> 00:25:33,500
I've found

459
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:35,450
during the investigation.

460
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,060
When did you marry Wu Lingsu?

461
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,450
Before I joined Shenxiao Sect.

462
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:48,930
Then we had Shizhen.

463
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,575
He is about your age.

464
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,460
Where is he?

465
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,780
In the capital.

466
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,780
Your uncle was granted as
Lord of Qingcheng

467
00:25:58,125 --> 00:25:59,900
and under orders to oppose North Liang.

468
00:26:00,675 --> 00:26:02,220
Outwardly, he is powerful.

469
00:26:02,975 --> 00:26:04,500
Is he taken hostage?

470
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,820
As long as my real identity
is not revealed,

471
00:26:08,175 --> 00:26:09,180
he'll be fine.

472
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:11,940
We must find a way to save him.

473
00:26:14,675 --> 00:26:15,950
You don't have to

474
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,925
worry about him.

475
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,700
Read this thoroughly

476
00:26:22,025 --> 00:26:23,060
and burn it.

477
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,060
Where are you going?

478
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,300
I have some errands to run.

479
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,740
I'll come back soon.

480
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,340
Why don't you read it to me?

481
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:56,700
One coin per word.

482
00:26:56,975 --> 00:26:58,060
Are you crazy?

483
00:26:58,275 --> 00:27:00,540
Your aunt has been concealed
her real name to investigate the case.

484
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,340
It's important.

485
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,200
How can you let me read it?

486
00:27:02,275 --> 00:27:03,050
It doesn't matter.

487
00:27:04,275 --> 00:27:05,540
Read it on yourself.

488
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,010
What message did you send?

489
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:01,860
How long has it been

490
00:28:02,275 --> 00:28:03,475
since we last saw Shizhen?

491
00:28:04,325 --> 00:28:06,900
There's no one in the capital
he can trust.

492
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,420
He carries his life in his hands.

493
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,700
Tell me what message did you send.

494
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,740
Details of Xu Fengnian's visit.

495
00:28:16,925 --> 00:28:18,780
It was supposed to be sent
to the capital.

496
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,500
If we tell them

497
00:28:21,275 --> 00:28:22,725
Xu Fengnian broke the sword array,

498
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,620
they'll trust us more.

499
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,625
What else?

500
00:28:30,525 --> 00:28:32,140
Layout of the North Liang barracks.

501
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,420
Only by doing this,

502
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,225
could Shizhen come home.

503
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,975
Her Grace treated me like a sister.

504
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,925
I owe her

505
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,275
my life.

506
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,450
It's just the layout of barracks.

507
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,900
Nothing confidential.

508
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,420
Who asked you to do this?

509
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,950
I don't need anyone to tell me

510
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:49,950
how to save my son.

511
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,175
You've been uneasy since last time

512
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,875
when Shizhen sent a letter to us.

513
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:00,450
Did he ask you to do this?

514
00:29:05,025 --> 00:29:07,100
He wants to escape the danger

515
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,580
and come home.

516
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,260
Has Shizhen

517
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,525
turned to the royal family

518
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,020
in the capital?

519
00:29:14,325 --> 00:29:15,340
Of course not.

520
00:29:16,925 --> 00:29:18,140
Good.

521
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,500
Don't you want him to come back?

522
00:29:23,025 --> 00:29:24,620
Do you really want to

523
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,300
sacrifice our son for North Liang?

524
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,820
General has left for the capital.

525
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,260
Did he tell you

526
00:29:30,425 --> 00:29:31,620
he would rescue Shizhen?

527
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:33,425
No, he didn't.

528
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,100
How can you believe him, then?

529
00:29:36,725 --> 00:29:38,580
If General doesn't

530
00:29:39,175 --> 00:29:40,950
bring Shizhen back this time,

531
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,725
I'll go to the capital myself

532
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,400
to rescue our son.

533
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,425
If you really

534
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,210
sent the military intelligence

535
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,075
to the capital,

536
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,125
I'd have no choice but to kill myself
in front of Her Grace's tomb.

537
00:30:07,075 --> 00:30:07,775
Fine.

538
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,780
I won't send the letter.

539
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,000
Don't tell Fengnian

540
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,950
about this.

541
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:16,800
Yeah.

542
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,600
Have you done with it?

543
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,375
My mother's murderer

544
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,625
was from the royal family of Liyang.

545
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,725
There's no concrete clue, isn't there?

546
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,460
It recorded the time

547
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,325
when my mother went to the capital.

548
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,625
Two points.

549
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,075
One,

550
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,050
she was just pregnant with me.

551
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,325
Two,

552
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,600
Xu Xiao was about to be granted as
the Lord of North Liang.

553
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,600
They had no choice

554
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,600
but to grant your father as the lord.

555
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,750
He conquered the six kingdoms.

556
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,200
They couldn't convince the public
if they didn't do that.

557
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,460
But the royal family

558
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,850
definitely didn't want North Liang
to have a young master.

559
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,300
So my mother's pregnancy

560
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,325
was what they feared most.

561
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:07,450
It turns out your enemy
is the royal family.

562
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,250
Yes.

563
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,850
Your father could
draw the conclusion, too.

564
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,125
Why didn't he

565
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,775
rebel against the capital?

566
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,250
If he rebelled,

567
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,550
the world would fall apart.

568
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,025
Numerous people would die.

569
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,900
For that reason,
you give up taking revenge?

570
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,625
No, I won't.

571
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,050
I just don't want to take revenge
at the expense of peace.

572
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,460
What do you mean?

573
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,275
If they sent out troops at the time,

574
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,660
my mother couldn't
leave the capital alive.

575
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,260
I think they dare not

576
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,225
take action in public.

577
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,475
They must've tried to assassinate her.

578
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,580
My mother was the top talent

579
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,225
of Sword Tomb of the Wu family
in nearly a hundred years.

580
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,800
They needed a real master

581
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,075
to kill her.

582
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,025
There might be more than one assassin.

583
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,500
I'll find out the assassins
who ambushed her

584
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,025
one by one

585
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,200
and take their heads with my own hands

586
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,925
to pay homage to her.

587
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,400
One day,

588
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,025
I'll go to the capital
to find out the truth myself.

589
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,750
Your mother left something to you.

590
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,550
What is it?

591
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,100
Follow me.

592
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,100
I'll wait here for you.

593
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:48,775
It's far from Qingyang Sect, isn't it?

594
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,875
Qingyang Sect has attracted
too much attention.

595
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,875
Her Grace preferred quietness.

596
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,325
What's this?

597
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,575
Her Grace and I

598
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,150
were from Wu Family.

599
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,125
I know.

600
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,125
Sword Tomb of the Wu family
was once the top sect of swordplay.

601
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,825
Not anymore.

602
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,260
Li Chungang.

603
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,180
Deng Tai'e.

604
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,250
Jian Jiuhuang.

605
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:24,000
Top masters of swordplay
emerge without end.

606
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,525
The Wu Family

607
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,500
has lost on fate already.

608
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,975
But it still has foundation.

609
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,325
Foundation

610
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,725
and family rules.

611
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,225
Back in the time,

612
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,650
Her Grace wasn't allowed
to be with General.

613
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,325
She broke up with her family

614
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,875
and went to Liaodong on a white horse.

615
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,100
So they finally got together

616
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,925
and then they had you.

617
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,075
The Wu family must be mad.

618
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,400
After the members of the family die,

619
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,900
their swords should be returned
to the Sword Tomb.

620
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,300
But Her Grace

621
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,800
was an outcast from her family.

622
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,725
Her sword

623
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,050
couldn't be sent back.

624
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,025
That's why

625
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,500
I sealed up her sword here.

626
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,325
She told me before she died,

627
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,425
if you

628
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,225
choose to practice martial arts,

629
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,425
her sword

630
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,725
would be left to you.

631
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,775
North Liang overran the whole world.

632
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,850
Her Grace

633
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,850
(Daliang Dragon Sparrow)
had defeated many heroes with the sword.

634
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,000
Her Grace also said,

635
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,525
if you

636
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,460
meet a good girl one day,

637
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,250
who happens to practice swordplay,

638
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,550
the sword would be left to her
as the betrothal present.

639
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,950
I'm afraid I won't meet anyone

640
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:13,500
like my mother.

641
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,380
As long as you like her,

642
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,800
she is the best in the world.

643
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,800
The big one in the mountain.

644
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,975
Are you Xiaoque'er?

645
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,950
Big one?

646
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,500
Is it a tiger?

647
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,025
It's a monster.

648
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,975
It's fair to call it a monster.

649
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,125
It's a strange beast
in Mount Qingcheng

650
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,600
called Hukui.

651
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,200
It's extremely fierce.

652
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,725
Have you seen it?

653
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,850
I once fought it.

654
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,900
It couldn't defeat me.

655
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,675
I couldn't defeat it, either.

656
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,700
It's a fight.

657
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,925
How strange!

658
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,500
There's no beast in Mount Qingcheng
that can fight it.

659
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,500
Xu Fengnian

660
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,875
will be back soon.

661
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,780
Mr. Xu is very nice.

662
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,525
He taught me to blow leaves.

663
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:42,000
I thought at the time

664
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,780
I would be his matchmaker

665
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,500
and arrange him a good marriage.

666
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,125
Yeah.

667
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,250
However,

668
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,175
he has you now.

669
00:37:53,475 --> 00:37:54,500
Wait.

670
00:37:55,475 --> 00:37:56,715
What do you mean?

671
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,200
Do I have anything to do with it?

672
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,400
I haven't found the right one for him.

673
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,320
It's a pity.

674
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,500
I always feel

675
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,300
he deserves a fairy.

676
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,525
Let's go.

677
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,850
Already?

678
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:15,500
Yes.

679
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,375
Do you want to come with us?

680
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:18,380
Mr. Xu.

681
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,350
I have

682
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,350
got your things off my mind just now.

683
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,175
What things?

684
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,325
So I can't go with you.

685
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:27,100
Oh.

686
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,375
It may not be a bad idea.

687
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,380
We're in a hurry.

688
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,060
When I get back,

689
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,020
I'll come to see you.

690
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:33,675
OK.

691
00:38:33,675 --> 00:38:34,580
I'll wait for you.

692
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,700
It's a deal.

693
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,250
What's up?

694
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,900
I feel sorry for you.

695
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,800
You don't even know

696
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,050
you've missed a fairy.

697
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,125
It's a favor to you.

698
00:38:55,725 --> 00:38:57,325
What have I missed?

699
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,425
What's the favor?

700
00:38:59,925 --> 00:39:00,950
Stop asking.

701
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,350
Is it what your mother left to you?

702
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:07,050
Daliang Dragon and Sparrow.

703
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,425
My mother's sword.

704
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,300
You practice blade instead of sword,
don't you?

705
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,850
This is also the betrothal present

706
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,375
to my future wife.

707
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,800
Isn't it a little dangerous

708
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,550
to use a sword as betrothal present?

709
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,595
Take it.

710
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,700
What're you doing?

711
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,075
You're my maid.

712
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,460
Shouldn't you hold it for me?

713
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,650
Or do you want me to hold it myself?

714
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:27,575
That's what you mean.

715
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,825
What do you think?

716
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:30,575
Never mind.

717
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:34,375
Where's your aunt?

718
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,275
She can't walk me out,

719
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,825
otherwise our relationship
will be disclosed.

720
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,750
We have to let people think

721
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,030
Qingyang Sect and I are enemies.

722
00:39:43,575 --> 00:39:44,900
Yeah, I get it.

723
00:39:46,025 --> 00:39:47,550
You can't go out from the gate.

724
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,900
It's strange

725
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,675
if I leave the enemy's place

726
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,075
with a sword box.

727
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,195
So what?

728
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,800
You'd better go out by the side door,

729
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,725
walk along the woods
to the mountain road ahead.

730
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,600
I'll let the carriage
wait for you at the corner.

731
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,900
What about 10 coins?

732
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,500
20.

733
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,175
Deal.

734
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,050
I should ask for more, shouldn't I?

735
00:40:13,975 --> 00:40:15,475
No.

736
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,525
Wait.

737
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,150
Remember.

738
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,500
Walk along the woods.

739
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,550
Don't go into the mountain.

740
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,140
I'm not a fool.

741
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,575
I know the way.

742
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,700
Keep it in your mind.

743
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:48,940
Hey.

744
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:49,725
He is out.

745
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,075
(Mount Qingcheng)

746
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,300
What you've done to me today,

747
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,340
I'll keep it in my mind.

748
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,950
Just wait.

749
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,325
One day,

750
00:41:14,325 --> 00:41:15,605
I'll return to Mount Qingcheng.

751
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,075
Let him go.

752
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,750
Is this the right way?

753
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,550
It sounds like

754
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,250
