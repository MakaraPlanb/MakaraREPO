64
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,960
just tell me.

77
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,680
then tell me.

Why should I tell you?

00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,360
Chief, if people always keep things to themselves,

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,920
it is easy to feel uncomfortable.

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,159

Tell me about it.

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,480
You can think of me as

102
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,840

00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,960
I hesitated at the time,

106
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,560
but the army was

107

in the midst of intense combat training.

108
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,960
And finally, I did not agree.

109
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,400
There had been

She felt that I was avoiding her,

112
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,120
and things got worse.

113
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,120
She clamored to break up with me.

114
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,640
I rushed back to Suzhou

115
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,800

For the whole twelve days of vacation,

117
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,720
she was somewhere else.

She was originally a pianist

with a great future.

120
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,360
She changed her career to become a music teacher

121
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,600
because she married me and wanted to settle down.

122
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,520
I thought

123
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,760
I couldn’t let her suffer,

124
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,480
so, I agreed.

Chief, after verification, Jiang Nanzheng was a soldier from Jiangsu Province.

137
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,480
She was born in 1966

138
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,440
and has no dad.

139

Mouth skills test the ability to express.

151
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,280
Then the hand skills

152
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,640

00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,120
I’m not gonna be mad at you anyway.

191
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,120
It’s over.

192
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,840
By the way, the sergeant asked me to get the documents.

193
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,800
It hasn’t arrived yet. I’m waiting for it.

194
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,400
Anyway, there is nothing to do.

195
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,480
Practice with me for a while.

196
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,880
You guys are only interested in

197
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,880
these swords and guns all day long.

198
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,480
I also need to practice, okay?

199
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,400
I want to practice this.

200
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,640
I know,

201
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,320
this is not the same as the one you practiced.

202
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,000
I’m telling you,

203
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,040
you’ll get something out of practicing with me.

204
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,760
Here’s the thing. After coming to the training ground

205
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,980
to practice for half a day,

206
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:05,920
you sweat

207
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,440
and your spirit is relaxed.

208
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,680
As soon as your spirit is relaxed,

209
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,760
your body will be relaxed,

210
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
then your fingers will be more flexible,

211
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,520
and it will be faster to practice inserting wires.

212
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,000
Come on.

213
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,760
Come on.

214
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,080
That makes sense.

215
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,320
All right.

216
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,200
I’ll practice with you.

217
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,280
- Otherwise, you think I’m afraid of you.
- Come on.

218
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,040
[Strict]

219
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,480
Take the gun.

220
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,760
I’ll teach you how to fight.

221
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,760
Do you want me to practice with a scarecrow?

222
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,480
I don’t want it.

223
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,480
I’m gonna fight with you directly.

224
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,880
Do you want to fight with me?

225
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,360
[Strict]

226
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,480
You’re making a big deal out of this.

227
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,640
I weigh dozens of jin more than you,

228
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,880
and I can knock you out.

229
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,040
You can fight with little Wangcheng. He’s light in weight.

230
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,360
You underestimate me.

231
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,560
Okay, I’ll fight with him first,

232
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,760
and then I'll fight with you afterwards.

233
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,720
Put on the protective gear first.

234
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,800
It’s my first fight with a female soldier.

235
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,800
I’m a little nervous,

236
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,640
so, I gotta go to the bathroom.

237
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,040
How can you go to the bathroom?

238
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,920
Come back.

239
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:02,880
You stand there.

240
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,470
I gotta go to the bathroom.

241
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:03,980
No way.

242
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,080
You…

243
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,280
- Idle folks lack no excuses.
- You see?

244
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,960
He’s afraid of me.

245
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,880
Jiang Nanzheng.

246
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,400
Listen,

247
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,200
you’ll never

248
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,520
forget today.

249
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,760
It’s just a protective gear.

250
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,600
How can it be unforgettable?

251
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,760
What a fuss!

252
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,720
Hold still.

253
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,800
Gloves.

254
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,240
Take them on.

255
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,280
Put on the helmet.

256
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,280
I’ll hold it for you.

257
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,320
Head down.

258
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,400
You’re back.

259
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,280
Get started.

260
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,960
How about it? Ready to start.

261
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,760
Okay, ready.

262
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,840
Stab him.

263
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,400
Be gentle, okay.

264
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,440
Again.

265
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,760
That was a hell of a hit.

266
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,160
One more round.

267
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,460
Little Wangcheng, are you okay?

268
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,200
All right, that’s enough.

269
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,240
You’re gonna get hurt.

270
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,200
No way.

271
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,520
It’s the last round.

272
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,600
That’s enough. No more fighting.

273
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,240
Division commander, our division commander.

274
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,420
This is our division commander!

275
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,800
This, our division commander!

276
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:19,770
This!

277
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,280
She’s just too excited!

278
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,650
Your plan has a flaw!

279
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,180
No…

280
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,320
I thought this would not work at first!

281
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,280
He is the division commander.

282
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,200
Doing this kind of child’s crap

283
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,160
is so not serious.

284
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,600
Which commander did this kind of things?

285
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,400
Listen to yourself!

286
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,400
Other commanders

287
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,400

288
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,180
for over a decade!

289
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,520
If I had senses in me,

290
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,440
I wouldn’t have listened to your nonsense!

291
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,240
But division commander,

292
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,360
I just felt that

293
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,760
in this way she’ll accept it.

294
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,600
I had no idea

295
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,320
Jiang is this kind of person.

296
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,880
You know I haven’t gotten in relationships or married.

297
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,360
Division commander, in this field,

298
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,520
I really have no experience.

299
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,160
Division commander was married,

300
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:57,760
but…

301
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,880
Stop talking, you!

304
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,720
don’t get mad…

305
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,600
I thought it would work.

307
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,080
It’s over.

00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:16,840
Now you’re done.

00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,440
Go for wool and come home shorn, right?

310
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,080
They were both mad.

311
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,230

00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,960

Why?

388
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,080
Because she said

389
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,160
you are the most talented soldier in our company,

390

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,160
Remember to

566
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,520
wipe the patient’s sweat

567
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,160
to prevent it from seeping into the wound.

568
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,280
Okay, call me if you need anything. I'm going out.

569
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,040

Let me do this.

It’s okay, I’ll do it.

Let me do this.

00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,000
I’m going to wipe his body.

576
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,480
I’ll go out then.

Thanks.

00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,000
Did Jiang Nanzheng ask for a leave?

585
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,120
Hail, Commander! Yes.

586
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,520

Where did you get?

590
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,800

Very effective.

after waking up,

607
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,960
depending on the actual condition

608
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,320
and development of the injury.

609
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,240

It’s so obvious

627
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,120
what happened between Jiang and Gu Yiye.

Don’t play dumb with me.

631

Their situation has been revealed in new recruit company.

632
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,520
You knew everything,

633
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,560
but did not say a word to me.

634
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
It now appears that

635
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,640
Song Jianshe is more experienced

636
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,480
in this kind of situation.

637
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,680
Gu Yiye had told me everything.

638
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,560
I’m such a fool

639
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
for believing him.

640
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,320
Did he lie to you?

641
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,480
No, he didn’t.

642
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,480
I’m telling you.

643
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,720
Both Gu Yiye

644
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,440
and Jiang Nanzheng

645
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,080
have the potential of being an excellent soldier.

646
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,600
But they may also fall on their way

647
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,520
of being an excellent soldier.

648
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,200
The stumbling block is nothing

649
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,920
but a wrong relationship

650
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,440
in a wrong time.

651
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,400
Qin,

652
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,880
I was wrong.

653
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,760
I admit that

654
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,200
I had kept it a secret

655
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,120
for what happened on Gu Yiye.

656
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,680
After all,

657
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,080
it didn’t affect his training, did it?

658
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:31,960
And,

659
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:36,120
no influences on his daily life.

660
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,240
And Guy Yiye

661
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,880
did not make it conspicuous.

662
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,760
What’s conspicuous?

663
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,040
A seed falls into the ground

664
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,640
and then it sprouts.

665
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,680
What comes next is growing

666
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,680
into a tall and leafy tree.

667
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,800
This kind of conspicuousness,

668
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,680
isn’t it too late?

669
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,120
I’ll talk to him

670
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,040
after he wake up.

671
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,720
I’ll cut the tree,

672
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,240
and dig out the seed.

673
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,320
What’s the use of all the talking?

[Inpatient ward]

675
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,400
I’m telling you, Zhang Fei.

676
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,120
You’re responsible for the injury of Gu Yiye.

677
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,840
But he has more responsibilities.

678
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,600
Mess around with few military theories.

679
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,000
Listen,

680
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,280
after he’s restored to health,

681
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,920
transfer him to cooking corps.

682
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,480
He can only come back

683
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,040
after getting rid of

684
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,960
his fickleness.

685
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,040
He can go nowhere except for digging up the vegetable plot.

686
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,400
I must end his fantasy

687
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,920
with the female soldier.

688
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,320
What?

689
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,280
You go first. What are you going to do with it?

690
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,600
What are you going to do with it?

691
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,960
Turn a blind eye,

692
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,920
just let it be?

693
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:58,880
I...

694
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
do you think I’m like that?

695
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,120
How can you think of me that way?

696
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,680
I think you’re just like that.

697
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,480
Don’t compare soldiers with officers.

698
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,760
Can anyone learn the skills

699
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,480
and win the battles

700
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,880
being in two minds

701
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,560
and focusing on other things all day?

702
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,679
Qin Hanyong,

703
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,920
how dare you say that!

704
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,320
It’s true that Jiang Nanzheng involves in it,

705
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,960
but she’s not the only one involving.

706
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,400
Gu Yiye from your company

707
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,840
should assume main responsibility.

708
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,280
He should be the first to be blamed.

709
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,080
Thank you very much.

710
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,760
He’s being blamed.

711
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,880
You are the boss.

712
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,840
It’s your call as to how to deal with it.

713
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:34,840
First of all,

714
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,000
they must not continue

715
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,989
this relationship.

716
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,560
Let alone the principles,

717
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,110
Jiang Nanzheng

718
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,320
is participating the competition on behalf of our company.

719
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,199
Besides Gu Yiye from your company

720
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,239
is also a model.

721
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,639
How can these two talents

722
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,159
be destroyed just like that?

723
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:50,920
Agree.

724
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:51,960
Secondly,

725
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,040
secondly, this should not be disclosed.

726
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,920
Are you saying that we don’t report it?

727
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,560
Functionally speaking,

728
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,600
the company is capable of dealing with this kind of stuff.

729
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:02,600
I mean,

730
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:03,920
no more punishment.

731
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:04,720
No way.

732
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,960
I must teach him a lesson.

733
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,120
How is that possible?

734
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,640
Come on, don’t put on airs.

735
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,400
You can see that.

736
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,800
It’s up to you.

737
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,640
If you punish him,

738
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,040
the matter will be made public.

739
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:22,640
That’s right.

740
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,560
The company is full of young soldiers,

741
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,000
so it is inevitable that there will be some ideas.

742
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,400
Yeah.

743
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,080
After publicity with great fanfare,

744
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,280
there was nothing originally, but everyone would think about it.

745
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,440
That would backfire.

746
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,400
I agree.

747
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,400
I support it with all my hands.

748
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,200
I admire you.

749
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,680
What's the use of admiration?

750
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,520
Think twice next time.

751
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,560
You are majestic

752
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,440
when you train.

753
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,370
Not a night tiger,

754
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:46,520
when something happens,

755
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:49,060
but a stupid roe deer.

756
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,040
Am I that stupid?

757
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,800
Commander,

758
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,360
she’s provoking you.

759
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,840
How dare you eavesdrop on others?

760
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,200
Absolutely not, I happened to pass by and couldn’t avoid it.

761
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:06,840
Come here.

762
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:08,960
What’s this?

763
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,040
Have some fruit.

764
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,400
Where did you get it? So many.

765
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,240
I picked the fruit in the reconnaissance camp directly under the division headquarters.

766
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,000
There were several dogs chasing me for a long time.

767
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,720
Commander，

768
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,960
you’d better wash it before eating.

769
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:21,960
It’s delicious.

770
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:22,680
Well,

771
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,480
the reconnaissance camp uses human waste as fertilizer.

772
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,360
Why didn’t you say earlier?

773
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,960
Commander Zhao was right.

774
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,440
Stupid roe deer.

775
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:34,320
[Unit 53052 of People’s Liberation Army Hospital]

776
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,400
How dare you run!

777
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,800
You brat.

778
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,440
Did the wounded make any reaction?

779
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,200
No reaction at all.

780
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,160
That’s weird. It’s been almost ten hours.

781
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,440
Try pinching his renzhong.

782
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,520
Pinch his renzhong.

783
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,240
It’s not working.

784
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,400
A little harder.

785
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,480
It hurts.

786
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,080
He’s awake.

787
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:11,840
You wake up!

788
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:14,960
Gao Liang.

789
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,600
Do I have a problem with you? You have to pinch that hard.

790
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,360
I’m worried you won’t wake up.

791
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,200
What happened to me?

792
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,480
What happened to you?

793
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,880
You are quite well.

794
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:27,880
When you lie down here,

795
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,520
there is someone to fan the wind, someone to take care of you.

796
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,560
All the brothers in the company were envious.

797
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,040
Tell me the truth.

798
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,760
Well, to be honest with you, according to your current situation,

799
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,760
you need another operation later.

800
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,840
Then, your brain needs to be cut open

801
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,040
and stirred up inside.

802
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,760
You’re a psychopath.

803
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,320
It’s just an exercise. Why were you climbing so high?

804
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,320
Can you fly?

805
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,400
Or will it not hurt when you fall?

806
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,880
I’m telling you, if I were the company commander,

807
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,000
I would punish you.

808
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,720
What you’re doing is reckless opportunism.

809
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:53,640
Understand?

810
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,400
Don’t move, can you take a break?

811
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,600
Gao Liang,

812
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,200
have you ever been to the zoo?

813
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,800
Have you ever seen a breeder

814
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,960
feed a tiger or a lion?

815
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,840
How to feed? Just feed it normally.

816
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,920
Otherwise, set a table and eat on the table?

817
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,080
These tigers and lions

818
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,600
are all beasts.

819
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,840
In the wild,

820
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,760
they tear preys to pieces

821
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,000
with their own claws and teeth.

822
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,600
There are rules about

823
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,680
what to eat

824
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,720
and what not to eat.

825
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,000
What does that mean?

826
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,880
But when they arrive at the zoo,

827
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,600
the breeder will

828
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,600
cut all the meat for them.

829
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,720
It’s convenient.

830
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,120
But after a long time,

831
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,880
these beasts

832
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,720
will not be able to hunt.

833
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,120
Give me a hand.

834
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,040
Can you stay quiet?

835
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,600
Come on, give me a hand.

836
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:05,440
[Wish you good health.]

837
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,600
You’re really a pain in the ass.

838
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,760
I’m telling you,

839
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,040
the army

840
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,360
is such a beast,

841
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,840
if you do not sharpen its claws for a long time,

842
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,960
the fighting ability will disappear.

843
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,800
We can tell ourselves

844
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,480
what is real and what is not.

845
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,320
But over time,

846
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,360
the real will become the fake,

847
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:26,680
and the fake

848
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,920
will become the real.

849
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,520
Okay,

850
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,400
I get it.

851
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,720
No wonder I feel a little disadvantaged

852
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,560
every time I fight with you.

853
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,080
It turns out that I treat you as my comrade

854
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,920
and show mercy everywhere,

855
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,080
but you treat me as a class enemy

856
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,720
and beat me to death, don’t you?

857
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:47,800
Okay.

858
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,120
Gu Yiye, I officially inform you.

859
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,480
From now on,

860
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,720
I will show no mercy on the

861
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,200
battlefield fighting for the

862
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,480
revolutionary friendship of Comrade Jiang Nanzheng.

863
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,320
Did you hear that?

864
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,480
Let the gale blow you to death.

865
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,560
You’ve been lecturing me all day.

866
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,120
Nurse.

867
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,080
Yeah, I do like him.

868
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,960
I didn't ask you that.

869
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,640
What are you going to do next?

870
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,600
Continue to like him.

871
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,440
Even if he is disabled,

872
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,640
I will not give up.

873
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:28,960
[National interests are above all else.]

874
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,680
Well, that’s very touching.

875
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,960
I don’t like him for touching people.

876
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,960
Stop it from now on.

877
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,080
I want you to end your relationship

878
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,720
with Gu Yiye from today,

879
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,640
even if it is an

880
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,000
ordinary comrade friendship.

881
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,800
Why?

882
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,240
No reason.

883
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,960
I am not consulting with you.

884
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:43,470
This is the decision of the organization, and you must obey it.

885
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,600
I can’t.

886
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,960
There are three stages to the command:

887
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:51,840
understanding,

888
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,280
execution,

889
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:52,870
and completion.

890
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,280
I allow you to give a discount in the first stage,

891
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,440
and the next two stages must be completed.

892
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,440
Get out of here.

893
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:07,400
[Wish you good health.]

894
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:04,660
I said I’ll do my best today.

895
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,370
Come on.

896
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,630
Do my best.

897
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,920
Okay, we have the attention of all departments.

898
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,370
Makeup, costumes, and props are ready.

899
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,530
Noodles with gravy.

900
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:14,780
The location of the camera.

901
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:20,070
What’s the sound?

902
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,120
You wake up.

903
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,440
Give me a hand.

904
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,040
You can’t get up yourself, right?

905
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:24,920
Let me help you.

906
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,440
Sit.

907
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,480
Lean over here.

908
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:28,650
This is where the actors are.

909
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:29,410
So, it’s where the light is.

910
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,720
I’m telling you,

911
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,800
I had a dream that

912
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,560
I ate noodles.

913
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:38,920
You wish.

914
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,480
That’s Chen Peisi eating noodles.

915
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,520
You woke up just in time,

916
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,480
hurry up and help me eat.

917
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:45,760
Come on.

918
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,360
I’ve eaten half a bucket this afternoon,

919
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,680
and now it makes my headache.

920
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,160
I’m a patient.

921
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,320
A patient?

922
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,560
Did you just have a baby and can’t you have ice cream?

923
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,280
I’m telling you,

924
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,600
as long as you’re not dead, get up and train.

925
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,160
It’s scary all day.

926
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,320
Jiang Nanzheng brought all the ice cream

927
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,960
from the service center,

928
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,840
to cool you down.

929
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,320
What a pity that it melted.

930
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,160
What a stupid girl.

931
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,280
If she is with me in the future,

932
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,600
she will slow me down.

933
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,360
Well, never mind.

934
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,240
I like her.

935
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,870
Why are you so shameless?

936
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,160
Who says she wants to be with you?

937
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:30,920
Also,

938
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,040
don’t call her stupid.

939
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,000
You always say things that

940
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,480
don’t make sense.

941
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,200
You stuffed the free military stamp

942
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,720
into the envelope,

943
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,080
and your concern was sent away.

944
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,640
Now, you’ve scraped your head,

945
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,680
and broken your arm,

946
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,680
leaving her on tenterhooks and crying.

947
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,960
Now the company knows about it.

948
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,080
Isn’t she stupid to do so?

949
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:53,840
What’s going on?

950
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,000
Is she in trouble?

951
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,280
Oops, my teeth!

952
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,120
I’m telling you,

953
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,080
Qin Dapao and Commander Zhao

954
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,720
are plotting.
