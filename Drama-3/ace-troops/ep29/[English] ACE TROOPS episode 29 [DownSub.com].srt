00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,240
Hi there.

6
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,160
Let's have a meeting

7
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,200
an hour later

8
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,640
to reschedule

9
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,240
the plan.

10
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,520
About your plan,

11
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,840
did you discuss it

12
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,880
with Vice-captain Gao?

13
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,039
We make plans and they carry out plans.

14
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,320
It's the working principle.

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We don't need to know their opinions.

16
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,520
I think it's not appropriate.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,360
Why is it not appropriate?

18
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,600
Of course it's not appropriate.

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,640
As long as my plan changes,

20
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,520
your plan should also change.

21
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,960
My training cannot be delayed.

22
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,000
By the way,

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,440
your 8-unit plan

24
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,520
is inappropriate.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,720
You ignored Mt. Guier.

26
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,880
You'd better turn it into a 12-unit plan

27
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,079
and reduce the time

28
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,280
for every unit by one.

29
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,560
Then you'll be able to

30
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,520
ensure the timeliness and the quality of the test.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,520
Don't be so rude.

38
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,840
How could you know it's not my guess?

39
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,440
Just consider

40
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,680
my suggestion.

41
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,320
Gao Liang,

42
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,200
that's too much.

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,000
They're all clean and spoiled.

48
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,960
How can they stand Captain Xia's training?

49
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,840
We did that

50

OK.

Close your eyes.

Sorry.

Slow down.

How's it going?

80
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,880
Did you complete your work?

81
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,400
No.

Xia Lin is like a whip.

83
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,760
He's always rushing me.

84
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,880
I have to hurry.

85
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,040
Even if he doesn't,

86
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,920
I still have to hurry.

87
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,600
The clock's ticking.

spared no effort on pursuing you.

Every girl would be touched.

91

Men are all the same.

92
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,040
They enjoy the time when they pursue you.

93
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,320
They show their best side

94
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,240
to you

95
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,560
and make you think

96
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,840
you're everything to them.

97
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:20,840
We tend to

98
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,440
magnify their best side.

99
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,880
But,

100
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,120
it's not real at all.

101
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,280
Then tell me about the real him.

102
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,159
Xia Lin

103
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,240
is actually like Gao Liang.

104
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,880
He was born in a poor family.

105
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,720
He worked hard to

106
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,400
make all the achievements.

107
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,320
He's studious.

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,560
He loves the army sincerely.

109
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Sometimes,

110
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,680
I think he's too strict with himself,

111
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,480
as if he's torturing himself.

112
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,760
As long as it's his task,

113
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,760
he tries his best to complete it.

114
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,080
I feel like he was born

115
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,720
to be a soldier.

116
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,520
His great faith

117
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,520
often touches me.

118
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,880
He's nice to me.

119
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,480
He's sincere

120
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:14,960
and caring.

121
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,880
According to you, Xia Lin is so good.

122
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,560
Then why did you refuse to marry him?

123
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,640
I didn't refuse.

124
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,360
He retreated.

125
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,680
He retreated?

126
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,440
Why?

127
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,040
Because he's jealous.

128
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,440
You know

129
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,520
I...

130
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,520
I used to tell Gao Liang I like him.

131
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,280
But I was young at that time

132
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,600
and my crush was immature.

133
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,720
It's been a long time.

134
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,159
I've already moved on.

135
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,080
Otherwise, I wouldn't fall in love with Xia Lin.

136
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,160
But now,

137
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,040
he's the one who can't move on.

138
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,560
But I think

139
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,520
the reason why he told you he's jealous

140
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,000
and refuses to be together with you now

141
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,400
due to jealousy

142
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,240
is that he loves you so much.

143
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,920
Otherwise, why would he be like that?

144
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,560
It's not easy for him

145
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,040
to lose his mind.

146
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,440
But if you love someone,

147
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,200
you should trust him

148
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,640
and yourself.

149
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,480
If there's no trust,

150
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,800
how to keep going?

151
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,720
It's true.

152
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,480
But sometimes, when we're in love,

153
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,640
we tend to be suspicious

154
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,640
and lose confidence.

155
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,840
I prefer confident men.

156
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,720
No matter what happens,

157
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,280
they never turn their backs

158
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,480
on their beloved.

159
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Forced love

160
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,480
does not last.

161
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,840
Just go with the flow.

162
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,520
All right. You should get back to work.

163
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,280
I got to go.

164
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:03,800
Tomorrow, I'm going to

165
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,040
run a test with them.

166
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,160
Go.

167
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,600
Go now!

168
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,400
Here's a mango.

169
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,360
It smells so good.

172
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,720

173
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,600
you'll travel with me

But I think

178
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,480
the reason why he told you he's jealous

179
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,960
and refuses to be together with you now

180
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,160
due to jealousy

181
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,400
is that he loves you so much.

You can go now.

196
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,080
Yes, sir!

197
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,200
Mountain Eagle 3. Mountain Eagle 3.

198
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,440
Tell me your location.

199
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,400
This is Mountain Eagle 2.

200
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,840
This is Mountain Eagle 3. Copy that.

201
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,440
We're about five kilometers away

202
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,600
from your left front side.

203
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,800
This is Mountain Eagle 2. Copy that.

204
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,960
It's a land mine.

205
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,960
It's in Mt. Guier.

206
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,360
There's a test subject today.

207
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,520
Contact Gao Liang now

208
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,720
and find out their location!

209
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,120
Yes, sir.

210
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,000
Mountain Eagle 2! Mountain Eagle 2!

211
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,560
This is Mountain Eagle 1.

212
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,480
This is Mountain Eagle 2. Copy that.

213
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,800
Comrades of People's Liberation Army.

214
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,720
What happened?

215
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,600
The injured is here.

216
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,240
They're family.

217
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,640
Are they okay?

218
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,520
The two adults have no heartbeat.

219
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,040
-The child is still alive. -Send her to the hospital now.

220
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,240
Come on. Hop on.

221
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,640
Come on.

222
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,360
Sir,

223
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,120
what's the name of the child?

224
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,240
Jingjing.

225
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,440
Is the girl that Gao Liang rescued

226
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,320
okay now?

227
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,040
Thanks to the timely rescue,

228
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,800
she's safe now.

229
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,040
Besides Mt. Guier,

230
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,560
Shanwang One's tests in other units

231
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,320
have all been completed.

232
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,240
After you sign this file,

233
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,560
you'll complete the task of the joint contingent.

234
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,600
Why did you exclude Mt. Guier?

235
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,080
It's a key test area of this region.

236
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,080
This is also my question.

237
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,480
Because it's a minefield.

238
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,560
It's very dangerous to take a test there.

239
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,040
It's dangerous so we have to avoid it?

240
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,200
Captain Gao.

241
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,240
Ms. Jiang.

242
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,600
Just now you saw

243
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,640
the risk of the minefield.

244
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,120
If there are more casualties,

245
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,400
our efforts

246
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,720
will be wasted

247
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,040
and we'll be punished.

248
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,200
The loss outweighs the gain.

249
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,480
We disagree with this temporary plan.

250
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,920
It's dangerous

251
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,840
so we have to take a test there.

252
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,320
Its conditions and environment

253
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,720
are close to those in a real battle.

254
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,600
It's a constructive work

255
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,240
of reference to our test.

256
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,480
Besides,

257
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,760
its conditions and environment

258
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,720
can help us find out

259
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,920
our system's problem.

260
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,880
We can run tests anytime.

261
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,640
But what if people die?

262
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,840
Do they have a second chance?

263
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,960
All soldiers of our squadron

264
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,840
are excellent.

265
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,480
But don't you think

266
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,160
dying in a pointless test is cruel?

267
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,600
Captain Xia,

268
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,240
I don't think you get it.

269
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,840
Ms. Jiang wants the system to

270
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,120
be scientific and authentic.

271
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,080
Her goal

272
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,800
is to reduce the casualties

273
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,360
in real battles.

274
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,760
Real battles?

275
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,560
Where are the real battles?

276
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,840
Don't pretend that you don't understand,

277
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,640
okay?

278
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,840
According to the current domestic situation,

279
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,760
everything we do is for economic development.

280
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,200
Will there be wars?

281
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,440
I think when we think about something,

282
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,760
we have to take the big picture into consideration

283
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,320
and stand on the high ground.

284
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,400
We can't just focus only on

285
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,800
our own perspective.

286
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,880
Enough.

287
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,640
You have the right to decide on the test contingent.

288
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,440
I agree with your temporary plan

289
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,440
but I have a request.

290
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,000
You need to report to the military

291
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,120
and all the land mines in Mt. Guier

292
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,840
need to be swept.

293
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,680
Otherwise, the local people

294
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,720
will be affected.

295
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,200
Don't worry.

296
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,160
I've already reported it to the headquarters.

297
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,320
And the headquarters has reported it

298
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,480
to the military district.

299
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,200
The military district will include it in the third batch of

300
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,680
unified border minesweeping plans.

301
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,200
Write in detail

302
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,280
in the test report.

303
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,720
Then I'll sign.

304
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,440
No problem.

305
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,400
I disagree.

306
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,920
I won't sign it.

307
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,800
Well,

308
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,920
you two are

309
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,400
experts.

310
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,440
But I hope you two can understand

311
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,760
the difficulty of our grassroots army.

312
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,520
OK.

313
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,480
I agree to sign it.

314
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:27,100
[General Hospital of the Military District]

315
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,720
It's all

316
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,360
thanks to Director Wang

317
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,240
that there was no surgical fee

318
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,600
and the surgery was successful.

319
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,120
Now I'm relieved.

320
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,280
Today,

321
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,280
I'm going to buy you food.

322
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,600
You take the check.

323
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,360
Why?

324
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,800
I spent all my savings

325
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,600
to pay her hospitalization fee.

326
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,440
Why do I have to take the check when you say it's your treat?

327
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,480
It's my treat, actually.

328
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,840
And as far as I can recall,

329
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,240
you never bought me lunch before, right?

330
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,360
Are you going to buy me lunch on credit today?

331
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,800
OK. It's your treat.

332
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,640
There's no difference.

333
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,640
By the way,

334
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,160
I heard

335
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,440
Plan 19 of Army B was ruined.

336
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,320
I'd like to suggest

337
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,160
restarting the test on Shanwang One

338
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,640
in Mt. Guier.

339
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,800
Nanzheng,

340
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,000
don't take it too seriously.

341
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,160
Did you forget how Jingjing got injured?

342
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,520
Now I'm tracking

343
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,680
the minesweeping plan of the military.

344
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,040
Start the certification work after

345
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,640
the entire minesweeping operation finishes.

346
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,440
Don't worry. There's still time.

347
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,600
Let's have lunch first.

348
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,160
Let's order

349
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,120
braised pork with pickled mustard.

350
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,040
Sounds good.

351
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,360
Would you like eggplant?

352
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,440
It's like a grease bomb.

353
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,760
What about

354
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,640
spicy frogs?

355
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,640
Just order the food you want to have.

356
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,280
But the performance of Shanwang One

357
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,000
really needs to be tested in such an environment.

358
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,080
If we miss this chance,

359
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,280
I'll get upset.

360
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,880
Let's have lunch first.

361
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,840
Come on. Order some food.

362
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,000
Order whatever you like. Come on.

363
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,480
Dig in. Aren't you hungry?

364
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,480
Let's eat.

365
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,440
While we're eating,

366
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,280
I want to tell you something.

367
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:18,400
We have to find a home

368
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,760
for Jingjing as soon as possible.

369
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,160
We can't make her feel like

370
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,310
she's an orphan,

371
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,069
right?

372
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,589
She's too young.

373
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,880
If she thinks she's an orphan, she'll feel wretched.

374
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,200
I know what it feels like to be an orphan.

375
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,120
I endowed two

376
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,800
poor relatives.

377
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,800
Their children are going back to school soon.

378
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,160
One is going to be a high school student,

379
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,600
and the other is going to be a middle school student.

380
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,280
They'll need to pay their tuition fees.

381
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,960
I spent all my savings

382
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,520
to pay Jingjing's hospitalization fee.

383
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,200
Can you

384
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,440
lend some money to me?

385
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,320
I'll pay their tuition fees.

386
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,040
When I get paid, I'll pay you back.

387
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,160
Is there anything else?

388
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,440
Yes.

389
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,760
About the

390
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,240
travel plan we made before,

391
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,960
I think

392
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,680
our schedules always overlap each other,

393
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,640
and we both are buried in

394
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,800
works all the time.

395
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,240
Let's avoid being extravagant.

396
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,200
Nanzheng,

397
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,960
if you disagree with it,

398
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,920
just forget what I said.

399
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,560
Go on. Eat.

400
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,360
Check, please.

401
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,880
We haven't finished. What's the rush?

402
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,560
You can take your time.

403
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:53,460
[Bethune]

404
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,800
How are you feeling?

405
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,400
The nurse told me you're here.

406
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,480
-Hi, Chunyu. -Mom.

407
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,160
Jingjing.

408
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,720
Come on. Sit down.

409
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,160
You're dripping with sweat.

410
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,160
She's getting tired.

411
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:01,880
Jingjing

412
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,240
calls me mom now.

413
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,400
Chunyu,

414
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,240
you're a nice person.

415
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,440
Stop talking about me.

416
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,480
You want to adopt Jingjing.

417
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,320
Did you discuss it with Nanzheng?

418
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,360
Well,

419
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,080
I brought it up a little.

420
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,720
Jingjing, it's time to give you an injection.

421
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,720
There you go. Be good.

422
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,760
Go.

423
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,760
Good girl.

424
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,080
Chunyu,

425
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,840
Jingjing's eyes...

426
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,400
It's thanks to Tong Bing.

427
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,800
After the expert of the Eye Center of Beijing Tongren Hospital

428
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,720
came here,

429
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,240
she made an appointment with the expert

430
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,600
to give Jingjing the second surgery.

431
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,320
But,

432
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,960
we're not sure about the result now.

433
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,400
If she's still out of condition,

434
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,640
she'll need new corneas.

435
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,080
Cornea transplant?

436
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,600
It's hard to find corneas, actually.

437
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,600
Yes, it's hard.

438
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,680
Anyway,

439
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,040
I want her to be cured.

440
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,440
Nanzheng.

441
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,320
I talked to the Civil Affairs Bureau

442
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,000
and contacted the Welfare House.

443
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,440
You're not qualified to adopt Jingjing.

444
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,080
I asked for my friends' help. They said

445
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,360
according to the policy,

446
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,160
you can only adopt her after you're qualified.

447
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,440
But she can go to the Welfare House.

448
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,320
The government will adopt her.

449
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,480
Here are the number and the address.

450
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,480
Did you receive the money?

451
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,440
Yes, I did.

452
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,600
I've written an IOU.

453
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,400
Sign it.

454
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,520
What?

455
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,400
What's wrong?

456
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,520
Do you want to welsh on the debt?

457
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,840
Well, Nanzheng,

458
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,720
it feels like you've changed.

459
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:07,260
[IOU. Borrower: Gao Liang]

460
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,840
What was I like before?

461
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,600
Forget

462
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,480
about the past. But now, you're

463
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,560
like...

464
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,160
a saint.

465
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,640
I'm not used to it.

466
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,960
Today, I prepared myself

467
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,000
to be scolded when I came back.

468
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,280
You think I'm so mean?

469
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,680
Not at all.

470
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,280
My dad is home.

471
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,720
So what if your dad's here?

472
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,840
I kissed my girlfriend.

473
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,680
Why should I be afraid? I'm afraid of no one.

474
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,840
Say it again.

475
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:38,880
Chief,

476
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,880
let me do it.

477
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,640
Where should I put it?

478
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,240
There.

479
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:43,880
OK.

480
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,280
Is it okay?

481
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,880
Over there.

482
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,320
OK.

483
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,040
Enough. Let me wipe your face.

484
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,760
You're sweating all over.

485
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,120
Listen to me carefully.

486
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,680
Be my ideal son-in-law

487
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,040
or be a part-time worker.

488
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,640
That depends on Zheng's mood.

489
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,480
Yes, sir.

490
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,320
Did you find any intelligence?

491
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,720
Did I have to look for it? Our old rival.

492
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,560
The First Battalion of Regiment 700.

493
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,160
There's a piece of reliable news.

494
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,280
Their Acting Battalion Commander Gu Yiye

495
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,320
was sent to study for a week.

496
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,200
Now their Instructor Zhang Yuejin

497
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,680
whose nickname is Little Wangcheng is leading them.

498
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,520
See,

499
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,000
he's a political cadre.

500
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,000
By convention, our special forces

501
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,720
never lost.

502
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:54,880
If we want to win,

503
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,280
will there be any cliffhanger?

504
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,000
Seriously,

505
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,920
we can't underestimate this confrontation.

506
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,800
It's very important to you, Niu Mancang

507
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,000
and me.

508
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,320
How come?

509
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,680
After the maneuvers,

510
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,080
there will be a crucial juncture.

511
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,280
If we win,

512
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,960
we'll be promoted.

513
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,800
Higher ranks, man.

514
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,080
We'll be promoted to Battalion Commander.

515
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,200
Our title will no longer contain "Acting".

516
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,840
The promotion has nothing to do with the maneuvers.

517
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,920
There are rules of cadres' promotion.

518
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,280
It's not up to you.

519
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,560
As an Acting Instructor, I'm responsible

520
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,120
for figuring out the promotion rules.

521
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,560
I've already asked them.

522
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,880
My news is reliable.

523
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,480
Anything else?

524
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,920
Mancang will be

525
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,240
promoted from Company Commander to Deputy Battalion Commander.

526
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,680
Why did the army organize

527
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,880
this confrontation?

528
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,560
You have to ask Staff Officer Zhou.

529
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,480
He's Xia Lin's subordinate.

530
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,680
He made the general plan.

531
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,840
The plan is confidential.

532
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,000
I've sent someone to investigate

533
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,200
but he didn't get anything.

534
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,360
Report.

535
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,680
Deputy Section Chief Xia of Military Training Section is here.

536
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,280
How many

537
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,200
plans of attack have you prepared?

538
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,320
One.

539
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,840
Just one?

540
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,440
You're too careless.

541
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,200
We're not careless.

542
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,760
Instead, we're precise.

543
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,760
Their main Commander Gu Yiye is not there.

544
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,640
Now their Instructor

545
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,040
is acting as Main Commander.

546
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,400
They're disorganized.

547
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,280
But, we

548
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,960
are the tank battalion

549
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,640
of the special forces.

550
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,120
To fight such a battle,

551
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,560
do we need a second plan?

552
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:30,880
Fine.

553
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,480
Tell me about your resolution.

554
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,480
Under the cover of the tank,

555
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,600
we'll send two companies

556
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,920
to attack Highland 791

557
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,000
and Highland 812 at a rapid rate.

558
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,600
We want to attract their attention.

559
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,640
Then,

560
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,680
we'll send the Ninth Company

561
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,240
to go through Heifengkou between cliffs,

562
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,320
destroy Laoye Temple

563
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,840
and occupy their command post.

564
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,400
We'll bring into full play our advantages.

565
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,440
Be fast, precise and cruel.

566
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,120
Decapitation Tactic again?

567
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:56,840
Yes.

568
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,480
Little Wangcheng and I lived in the same dormitory before.

569
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,040
Thinking of our friendship,

570
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,400
I'll use a sharp knife

571
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,760
when I cut off the head.

572
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,680
What if you meet your old rival

573
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,840
Gu Yiye?

574
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,160
Our friendship is better.

575
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,360
If I capture Gu Yiye,

576
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,320
I'll put the sharp knife aside

577
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,960
and cut off his head with a stone.

578
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,520
Amazing.

579
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,360
Well,

580
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,080
can't you

581
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,400
use some technologies?

582
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,480
For example,

583
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,360
launch an electronic feint attack.

584
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,880
This morning,

585
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,400
we came close to them and scouted them.

586
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,400
We found on their highland,

587
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,320
their defense is disorganized,

588
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,000
so we decided to

589
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,640
finish the battle

590
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,840
at the highest speed

591
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,280
and spend the remaining time

592
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,440
on something meaningful.

593
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:43,960
Good.

594
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,080
I'll report your plan

595
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,480
to the Chief of Staff.

596
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,080
However,

597
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,040
I want to tell you that

598
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,080
don't be too cocky.

599
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,520
Otherwise, you'll tend to fail.

600
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,400
No matter who you are,

601
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,840
even the future son-in-law of the Army Commander.

602
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,280
Deputy Section Chief Xia,

603
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,520
being cocky or not,

604
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,640
I do know one thing.

605
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,200
Anyone who quarrels with

606
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,680
his fiancée at home

607
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,040
is definitely a jerk.

608
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,520
Still one kilometer away?

609
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,280
The battle starts at dawn.

610
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,320
Only one small position was taken till now.

611
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,560
I sent you the tanks for nothing?

612
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,200
They've set up tank ambush positions.

613
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:48,800
Our tanks

614
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,720
were out of action within 20 minutes.

615
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,080
Where did that come from?

616
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,000
They are cleverly disguised.

617
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,080
We didn't find them

618
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,040
within 50m distance.

619
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,160
You couldn't fight a battle without tanks?

620
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,600
Go fight anyway!

621
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,120
You have one hour

622
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,480
to take Highland 791!

623
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,200
Niu Mancang.

624
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:10,800
Yes, sir!

625
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,960
How's it going in Highland 812?

626
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,240
They have a solid fortification.

627
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,440
We're moving forward slowly.

628
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,200
It's been two hours.

629
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,440
According to the plan,

630
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,520
the 4th Company shall attack by now.

631
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,920
Even the periphery of 791 and 812

632
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,080
is not taken yet.

633
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,160
If we send them now,

634
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,320
they'll be the living target.

635
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,360
Without Commander, the 1st Red Battalion

636
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,160
still fight furiously with his spirit.

637
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,320
This is Gao Liang.

638
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,160
Gao Liang?

639
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:44,760
Yes, sir!

640
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,800
What's wrong with you?

641
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,280
How can you fight a battle like this?

642
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,480
Chief,

643
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,760
I'm reckless this time.

644
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,080
As the tip of the dagger of Army A,

645
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,600
you are defeated like this.

646
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,240
Fighting for

647
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,240
the honor of ace troops,

648
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,160
they spend

649
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,440
200 percent vigor for the battle.

650
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,080
And you?

651
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,200
The maneuvers started two hours ago,

652
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,720
you are still

653
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,600
not fully awake.

654
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,240
How can you not be defeated?

655
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,320
Chief,

656
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,760
please punish me.

657
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,200
Will it work?

658
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,480
Use your brain!

659
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,200
You haven't found the reason for the failure.

660
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,640
Special operations?

661
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,040
More like specially brainless!

662
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,160
This is Gao Liang.

663
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,280
Vice Captain Gao,

664
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,760
I was away for a week to study,

665
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,920
but I took three days off.

666
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,040
The truth is

667
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,160
you can't always focus on

668
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,360
the results.

669
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,560
Otherwise,

670
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,240
you'll lose again.

671
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,240
I'll start my counterattack.

672
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,800
Be prepared.

673
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,560
Gao,

674
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,680
Gao,

675
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,200
they start the counterattack.

676
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,000
Notify each company.

677
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,840
We are now changing from attack to defense.

678
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,200
Too late now.

679
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,560
Their attack is very furious.

680
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,000
We don't have time to turn to defense.

681
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,640
Chief!

682
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,320
Attention!

683
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,320
The attack turned into a breakout.

684
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,960
Then the breakout turned into a defense.

685
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,600
A crushing defeat!

686
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,000
Each of you has

687
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,320
excellent personal ability

688
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,480
and has won countless medals.

689
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,240
That meant nothing for the maneuvers.

690
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,920
What is the problem?

691
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,280
Report!

692
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,400
This time

693
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,720
the main reason is the battle plan.

694
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,320
I was reckless.

695
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,400
Do you know

696
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,480
what the collective opinion of

697
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,160
the judging panel is?

698
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,160
The overall training level of

699
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,000
the 1st Red Battalion is very high.

700
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,000
They do

701
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,640
match with you.

702
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,200
Their infantry-tank synergy is very skillful.

703
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,960
In anti-tank technology,

704
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,000
they are one of the best in the military district.

705
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,760
They played to their strengths.

706
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,280
Especially, the ability of their commander

707
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,800
is a magnitude higher

708
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,400
than yours.

709
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,280
Got it?

710
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,840
You, Special Operation Battalion,

711
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,080
as the tip of the dagger for the whole Army Group.

712
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,400
In the future war,

713
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,960
you're probably the first batch

714
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,000
being sent to war.

715
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,840
Fortunately, it's only maneuvers.

716
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,280
If this is a real war, and you got defeated

717
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,400
like this in the first battle.

718
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,960
The morale of the Army Group

719
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,660
is completely lost by you.

720
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,240
Wang Yibing.

721
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,040
Yes, sir!

722
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,410
The tip of the dagger should behave as it should be.

723
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,480
The Special Operation Battalion

724
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,560
doesn't keep losers.

725
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,560
Haven't they been trying

726
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,120
the last-place elimination?

727
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,840
The elimination rate of our officers

728
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,840
and soldiers is about 30%.

729
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,520
Special Operation Battalion 2,

730
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,120
as a team in name only,

731
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,880
shall have a last-place elimination, too.

732
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,480
Give away their place

733
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,320
to any of the Infantry Battalions

734
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,200
of the Army Group

735
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,200
who wins

736
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,440
the battle over them.

737
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,360
Yes, sir!

738
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,460
[Opinions on the Actualization of the Military Exercise]

739
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,680
Xia Lin, your proposal is very timely.

740
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,800
An actual combat test for battalion and

741
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,120
company level first-line commanders

742
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,600
responds to the Army Commander's usual standards.

743
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,520
Future warfare is becoming increasingly diverse.

744
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
As Special Operations,

745
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,880
they shall keep updating their minds and means.

746
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,400
Gu Yiye used a psychological tactic this time.

747
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,040
He disturbed Gao's judgment

748
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:17,840
and made him reckless.

749
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,400
That's the reason for his failure.

750
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,280
I can see that a lot of your thoughts

751
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,520
is forward-looking.

752
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,080
I have formally presented you

753
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,400
to the Army Commander as Section Chief.

754
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,320
So now you have two choices.

755
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,040
First,

756
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,360
go directly as the Section Chief of the Training Division.

757
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,600
Second,

758
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,280
Colonel of Regiment 720.

759
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,600
Now the previous Colonel of Regiment 720

760
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,320
Qin Hanyoung is redeployed

761
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,800
as the Colonel Captain

762
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,760
of the Special Operations Battalion.

763
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,840
This position may

764
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,840
be taken by you.

765
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:47,720
The specifics will be clear

766
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,600
with the opinion of the officer department.

767
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,080
Thank you, sir, for your care and training.

768
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,680
I will cherish the opportunity and work harder.

769
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,040
Too salty!

770
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,440
Heavy flavor.

771
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,680
Have some meat.

772
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:37,840
Wait.

773
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,280
I'll split the food.

774
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,160
This plate is Xiaofei's.

775
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,960
Xiaofei is growing up now.

776
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,160
You three behaved like stray dogs.

777
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,160
Don't touch it!

778
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,480
He calls you a dog.

779
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,920
What? He meant you.

780
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,000
Just let them have enough.

781
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,320
Come on, try this.

782
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,520
Xiu, don't help them today.

783
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,400
They are not here for food today.

784
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,680
They are here to revenge.

785
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,080
That's right.

786
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,920
Xiu,

787
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,600
fill his cup.

788
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,960
Let's take revenge on him.

789
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,040
I'll have this.

790
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,120
A bit leftover.

791
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,080
Hey, easy.

792
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,400
Sit,

793
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,150
don't stand here.

794
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:19,880
Niu.

795
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,120
Dig in.

796
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,880
-Let me do this. -I'll do it.

797
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,320
Xiu,

798
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,760
leave it to him.

799
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,190
Let him do the errands. Enjoy the food.

800
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,230
Just sit down as Captain said.

801
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,280
Just sit down as he said.

802
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,230
-Have some. -Just sit.

803
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:44,920
Leave him alone.

804
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,150
OK.

805
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,800
Are you drunk?

806
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,190
No, I am not.

807
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,120
I can drink definitely.

808
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,760
Good boy.

809
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,880
Have a look.

810
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,710
Comrade Xiaofei,

811
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,720
that's not right

812
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,720
to treat us differently.

813
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,840
Why only give him

814
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,360
not me?

815
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,440
Why give it to you?

816
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,200
Come on, Xiaofei, show us.

817
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,800
Combat Preparation!

818
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,840
Well done! One,

819
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,240
two.

820
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,840
Hit here.

821
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,000
Three.

822
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,120
See?

823
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:17,560
Harder.

824
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,360
Punch!

825
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,520
That's enough.

826
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,320
Well done!

827
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:22,880
Nice, Xiaofei!

828
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,600
Well played.

829
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,120
Comrade Gu Xiaofei, come!

830
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,440
It's Zhang Xiaofei, not Gu Xiaofei.

831
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,440
My last name is Zhang.

832
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,080
All right, Comrade Xiao Fei.

833
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,800
Well played.

834
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,520
Your moves are beautiful, stable, and accurate.

835
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,040
You call that beautiful?

836
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,400
I'll show you.

837
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,840
Why compare with a kid?

838
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,640
I'll show you something special.

839
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,920
He's drunk.

840
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,240
Make a fool of himself.

841
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,000
Gu Yiye,

842
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,080
we've been friends and colleagues for years.

843
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,000
Do you have to take it so seriously?

844
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,880
Niu, you even bought the celebration wine.

845
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,640
What Deputy Battalion Commander?

846
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,240
In your dreams! You deserve it!

847
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,560
Jiang Weixing!

848
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,680
Yes, sir!

849
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,640
Don't be a jerk!

850
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,080
Xiu and the kid are here.

851
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:04,760
Sit down!

852
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,440
Yes, sir!

853
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,640
Gu,

854
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,840
We haven't had a walk like this for a long time.

855
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,440
Yeah.

856
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,080
I'll have a word with you

857
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,560
with the help of alcohol.

858
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:23,880
Normally,

859
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,880
I won't

860
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,800
be able to say it out loud.

861
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,440
Shoot.

862
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,320
Defeat you

863
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,880
is not my fault

864
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,000
anyway.

865
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,920
But I do feel sorry for making you kicked out

866
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,080
of the Special Operations by Cheng.

867
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,480
But this has nothing to do with the promotion.

868
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,680
Jiang was right.

869
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,720
I don't feel good about it, too.

870
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,800
Get some humanity.

871
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,880
But I don't agree with his point.

872
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,880
You can't mix personal feelings

873
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,840
with training standards,

874
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:58,720
right?

875
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,880
That's negligence.

876
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,000
I am on your side.

877
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,960
It's right to stick to the rules.

878
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:04,800
Yeah,

879
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,080
I am glad

880
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,400
to hear this.

881
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,920
I've checked the maneuvers plan.

882
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,480
It's made by Xia Lin.

883
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,320
I know.

884
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,320
He notified me

885
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,640
back then. I didn't take it seriously.

886
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:19,960
He's going to

887
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,560
hit two birds with one stone.

888
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,200
Why are you still messing with him now?

889
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,360
How long will this last?

890
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,120
I do hate him as a person.

891
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,000
He flings himself at me every day,

892
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:31,920
right?

893
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,440
But he's not against me.

894
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,080
He used his brain.

895
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,040
He learns something from

896
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:38,800
the office.

897
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,880
I heard the news

898
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,240
that Qin Dapao

899
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,680
will be back as the new Captain.

900
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,160
It's a pity.

901
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,360
He's back

902
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,120
but I'll leave.

903
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,960
Iron battalion, flowing soldiers.

904
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,960
Maybe you'll

905
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,840
be back someday.

906
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,000
With the alcohol,

907
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,240
I'll tell you something from the heart.

908
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,600
I won't say it when I am sober.

909
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,360
Fine,

910
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,000
go ahead.

911
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,760
I didn't expect this.

912
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,320
Actually, I can't take it.

913
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,200
I haven't figured out what to do yet.

914
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,400
Being in the army for these years,

915
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,960
I am so unsure of what to expect for the first time.

916
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,000
Right now, in front of Weixing and Niu,

917
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,040
I can't say much about it.

918
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,520
Although they are now mentally broken,

919
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,120
I have to hold on.

920
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,720
If I can't hold it,

921
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,440
the team is finished.

922
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,800
Enough.

923
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,280
What's your point?

924
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,080
Jiang Nanzheng

925
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,640
is back finishing her master's study.

926
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,200
We planned to

927
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,560
get married.

928
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,960
But we haven't seen each other since she came back.

929
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,440
Now, I don't want to see her.

930
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,520
We should postpone our marriage.

931
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,360
I am responsible for

932
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,880
all her aggravation.

933
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,360
Right?

934
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,880
In the end, it's because of my incompetence.

935
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,080
I understand

936
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,520
that you don't want your beloved woman

937
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,360
to see you now.

938
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,400
Dad, the meal is ready.

939
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:33,680
Braised pork with dark soy sauce.

940
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,200
Come on, Dad.

941
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,160
Have a try.

942
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,240
Gao Liang's

943
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:40,920
recipe.

944
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,400
How's the taste?

945
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,520
-Delicious. -Not bad?

946
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,400
Very nice.

947
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,200
Good, right?

948
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,160
Gao Liang can be replaced.

949
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,200
Indeed.

950
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:55,800
Nanzheng,

951
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,560
Gao Liang

952
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,360
was defeated by Gu Yiye.

953
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,600
A bad defeat.

954
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,920
His Special Operations Battalion 2

955
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,240
was kicked out of

956
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,040
the Special Operations Battalion.

957
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,200
Unprecedented punishment.

958
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,800
Gao Liang had a great setback.

959
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,160
I don't know if he

960
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,400
could hold on this time.

961
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,480
Sometimes,

962
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,160
being a father-in-law

963
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,160
is quite contradictory.

964
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,360
I don't want

965
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,960
my daughter to suffer.

966
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,120
But I do want my son-in-law

967
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,600
to suffer.

968
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,600
In the beginning,

969
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,520
I watched him try to take my daughter away.

970
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,960
I didn't like him at all.

971
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,080
And then,

972
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,200
I wanted to

973
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,440
give him lessons.

974
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,600
Dad, why?

975
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,920
I am afraid that he has not gone through

976
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,680
enough setbacks to be strong,

977
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,560
and can't do well enough

978
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,520
in your future days.

979
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,280
I want to offer my daughter the best.

980
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,600
All the bitterness

981
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,800
will be suffered by him.

982
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:01,720
So,

983
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,560
it's quite hard to be my son-in-law,

984
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,720
am I right?

985
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:07,640
Cheers.

986
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,280
How's you and Xiu?

987
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,640
I am telling you

988
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,440
if I hear that Xiu

989
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,440
suffered a bit,

990
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,880
I'll beat you up.

991
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:23,760
Want the truth?

992
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,720
Xiu

993
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,360
treats me like another son.

994
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,320
What?

995
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,080
Son?

996
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:32,800
Back home,

997
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:33,880
no matter

998
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,800
it's the bookshelf

999
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,680
or the old trunk,

1000
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,080
she turned them all upside down.

1001
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,000
And get all the books

1002
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,280
out to flatten its pages,

1003
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,480
saying this makes it neat.

1004
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,480
Last time, she almost wore

1005
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,240
the distributed pair of leather shoes

1006
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,800
by brushing them before my wearing.

1007
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,640
She has to try

1008
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,000
to see if the water's too hot before I drink.

1009
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,640
It seems

1010
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,640
she's just about fed me food.

1011
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,320
Isn't it good?

1012
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,400
She serves you like a king.

1013
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,600
How many men are eager for this

1014
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,200
while you're not happy about this.

1015
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,760
Fine, stop acting.

1016
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,920
I'm not that kind of person.

1017
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,840
Xiu and I are both

1018
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,840
trying to give our best to each other.

1019
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,680
But we try too hard.

1020
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,240
That is not happy.

1021
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,480
I'm very happy with Xiu.

1022
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,240
I gave way to her.

1023
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,480
I was afraid that she might have the slightest aggravation.

1024
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,720
When the accident happened,

1025
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,520
we all felt sorry.

1026
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,680
Only you

1027
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:34,920
stood out

1028
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,000
and took the responsibility.

1029
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:38,920
Xiu

1030
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,240
suffered a lot.

1031
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,400
You have to treat her well

1032
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,760
and give all your love

1033
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,040
to her.

1034
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,640
That's it, I'm leaving.

1035
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,080
Hey, wait.

1036
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,240
Whenever

1037
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,910
I have a mood swing,

1038
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,520
I can't feel this shoulder.

1039
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,640
It's even out of action sometimes.
