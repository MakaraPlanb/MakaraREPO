1
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,190
Bro.

2
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,270
I never thought

3
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,470
I would be so close

4
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,350
to you like now.

5
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,150
I've fired all the bullets

6
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,990
and thrown all the grenades.

7
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,710
There's no turning back now.

8
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,430
But

9
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,550
I will never be a captive.

10
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,590
Bro!

11
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,710
Jiang Nanzheng.

12
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,630
Take care.

13
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,230
Jiang.

14
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:07,790
Are you okay?

15
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,830
Slow down on the way.

16
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,470
Don let him get hurt.

17
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:41,670
Daguo.

18
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,030
You okay? Can you hang in there?

19
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,630
Yes, I can.

20
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,990
Bro, hang in there.

21
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,230
Beihai.

22
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,630
How are your legs?

23
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,070
They hurt.

24
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,950
I never felt a sharp pain like this.

25
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:10,870
Gu.

26
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,150
Can I shout?

27
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,750
Not now.

28
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,070
We're still unclear about this place.

29
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,750
After we cross the river,

30
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,310
we'll arrive at our defense area.

31
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:23,550
Then

32
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,670
you can shout as loud as you like.

33
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,270
Do you think my legs

34
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,350
can be kept?

35
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,070
Yes.

36
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,950
I promise.

37
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,150
If you they cut your legs,

38
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,830
I'll ask them to give you new ones.

39
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,790
I don't want to hear a joke.

40
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,630
Why did you let him sit up?

41
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,630
Prevent him from drinking more water.

42
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,790
I couldn't stop him.
He insisted on getting up.

43
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,990
As a platoon leader,
I can't lie on a stretcher

44
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,950
and let my soldiers carry me
while retreating.

45
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,510
Now I'm the acting platoon leader.

46
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:27,870
You have to listen to me.

47
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,510
I'm still alive.

48
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,270
You already can't wait?

49
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,550
If I knew that,

50
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,310
I wouldn't ask you to buy dresses for Xiu.

51
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,190
I'll buy dresses.

52
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,550
Well, I'll buy 20 dresses for her
after I go back.

53
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,750
I have to buy more dresses than Gao Liang.

54
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,110
Please keep

55
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,190
your promise.

56
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:54,870
I never

57
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,270
break my promise.

58
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,630
Where's his stretcher?

59
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,510
He gave his stretcher to someone.

60
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,670
Three soldiers got injured on the way.

61
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,670
One of them stepped on a toxic pole.

62
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,990
The other two stepped on land mines.

63
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,870
Stop drinking!

64
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,390
No.

65
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,750
You have to lie on a stretcher.

66
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,870
Lie down!

67
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,710
Alert! Hurry up!

68
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,950
Be careful, everyone! There are enemies!

69
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,030
Somebody help!

70
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:53,870
Come on! Help!

71
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,550
Follow me!

72
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,190
Come on!

73
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,110
I need two more people.

74
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:27,710
- Have a check there.
- Alert!

75
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,190
Come on!

76
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,750
Somebody help!

77
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:37,830
I regret that

78
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,270
I married Xiu.

79
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,430
Go!

80
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,710
Tell her to

81
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,550
forget me.

82
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,750
How's our platoon leader?

83
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,470
Platoon leader!

84
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,150
Say something!

85
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,430
Medic!

86
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:39,990
Sergeant Han.

87
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,710
Is there a radio that can never be blown up?

88
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:46,670
Sergeant Han.

89
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,790
Is there a radio that can never be destroyed?

90
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,670
Is there a radio?

91
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,750
Is there a radio that can never be destroyed?

92
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,110
Platoon Leader Xia.

93
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,110
Sergeant Han.

94
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,590
Platoon Leader Xia.

95
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,270
Is there a radio that can never be destroyed?

96
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:14,790
Sergeant Han.

97
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,910
Gu Yiye is back.

98
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,790
He's in the field hospital.

99
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:33,770
Press here.

100
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,430
Hurry up.

101
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,660
Move into the center.

102
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,150
Yiye.

103
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,990
You're injured.

104
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,230
Let me have a check.

105
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,430
I'm fine.

106
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:48,990
There were only two shrapnel.

107
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:49,990
They've already been taken out.

108
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,470
How could you be fine?

109
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,590
Are you really fine?

110
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,510
Yes, I'm fine.

111
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,990
As you can see,

112
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,910
if I was not okay,

113
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,710
they wouldn't let me go.

114
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:58,910
No kidding.

115
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,310
Where's Gao Liang?

116
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,990
Why didn't I see him?

117
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,470
He's at the back.

118
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:08,990
At the back?

119
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:10,950
He covered us.

120
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,070
He was alone...

121
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,790
Doctor.

122
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,710
How's our platoon leader?

123
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,750
Our platoon leader.

124
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,590
Which platoon leader?

125
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,830
There are a lot of platoon leaders
in this room.

126
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:19,790
Who are you looking for?

127
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:23,470
Zhang Fei who's with the Ninth Company
of the Third Battalion of Regiment 720.

128
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,590
Your platoon leader is already dead.

129
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,630
That's not true, doctor.

130
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,310
He was fine. How could he die?

131
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,430
When he arrived here,

132
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,030
there's already no breath or heartbeat.

133
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,350
What are you going to do?

134
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,430
We've already been through
three disturbances today.

135
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,550
We're also sad.

136
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,870
- That's not true, doctor. He couldn't die!
- I'm busy.

137
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,750
Jiang.

138
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:47,750
Doctor!

139
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,270
Enough.

140
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,910
- Sergeant.
- Enough.

141
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,870
- Stop, Gu Yiye. Stop.
- Liar!

142
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,470
Liar!

143
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,030
Liar!

144
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,700
Liar!

145
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,470
Yiye, calm down.

146
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,070
You're already back.

147
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,310
How can I calm down?

148
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,830
How can I calm down?

149
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:05,910
Yes, I'm back.

150
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,430
But where's our platoon leader?

151
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,030
Where's our platoon leader?

152
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,550
Where's our platoon leader?

153
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,510
Liar! Liar!

154
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:19,070
Return our platoon leader to me!

155
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,190
Platoon leader! Platoon leader!

156
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,980
Platoon leader!

157
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:32,550
No way!

158
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,390
Platoon leader!

159
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,110
No way!

160
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,070
Return our platoon leader to me!

161
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,830
You bastards!

162
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,270
After knowing or seeing

163
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,190
that other comrades left and died

164
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,870
one by one,

165
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,150
especially after knowing that
Platoon Leader Zhang Fei died,

166
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,910
Gu Yiye suffered from

167
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,950
mild post-traumatic stress disorder.

168
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,910
He became very emotional.

169
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:19,490
[6 months later...]

170
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,430
I know

171
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,990
he needs time to heal the wound.

172
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,390
I believe one day he'll move on

173
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,550
and escape from the shadow of the war.

174
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,430
Gao Liang.

175
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,510
Jiang Nanzheng.

176
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,910
I thought you wouldn't come back.

177
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,870
I almost died there,

178
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,390
but I'm back now.

179
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:04,190
They all said you didn't come back.
It scared me to death.

180
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,190
It's okay. Now I'm back.

181
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,510
Do you feel relieved?

182
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,869
Not yet.

183
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,369
So many people

184
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,990
are watching us.

185
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,390
Think about the influence.

186
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:19,829
Stop.

187
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,780
Let me show you something.

188
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,950
You gave me two pieces of White Rabbit candy.

189
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,790
When I almost gave up,

190
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,270
I ate one piece.

191
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,470
About this piece,

192
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:38,870
I didn't eat it.

193
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,470
It's put in my pocket all the time.

194
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:41,950
It's thanks to it

195
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,550
that I could go back.

196
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,430
Stop... Stop crying.

197
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,830
Take a seat.

198
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,870
Wipe your tears.

199
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,750
Why would you use this?

200
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,590
Did you forget that it was given by you?

201
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,350
You gave it to me
when we were going to August Town.

202
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,070
Let me show you another thing.

203
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,830
What's wrong with your waist?

204
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:19,830
Nothing.

205
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,750
The wounds have already been healed.

206
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,230
It's just that there are two scars left.

207
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,550
They all put the order

208
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,390
in front of their chests,

209
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,150
but I put it on my waist.

210
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:30,910
Look.

211
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,150
I used cartridge cases

212
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,630
to make this fruit knife.

213
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,110
It's yours now.

214
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,270
When did you come back?

215
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,870
After you retreated,

216
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,750
I stayed behind the enemies

217
00:18:59,190 --> 00:18:59,990
for about 11 days.

218
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,310
Why did you come back so late?

219
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,590
Actually, I'm glad that I could come back.

220
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,910
I also wanted to come back early.

221
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,470
I...

222
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,790
I jumped off a cliff.

223
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,150
Then

224
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,710
I met Niu Mancang.

225
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,230
Later,

226
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,740
we fought against enemies all the way.

227
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,870
We met a lot of enemy agents.

228
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,430
It's very hard to get rid of them.

229
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,390
We had fought for three to four days.

230
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,750
We didn't have any guns or bullets,

231
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,590
so we robbed them

232
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,310
and picked up their bullets.

233
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,470
In the end, we were starving.

234
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,950
We ate everything in the mountain.

235
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,150
We ate mice and snakes.

236
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,130
However,

237
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,870
we defeated many enemies

238
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,550
and captured three soldiers.

239
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,590
You know what? Niu Mancang

240
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,710
didn't even get hurt. It's amazing, isn't it?

241
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,750
Let me tell you something more amazing.

242
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,740
I heard

243
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,670
Niu Mancang and me

244
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,030
have already been listed as martyrs
by the company.

245
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,150
The memorial service was about to be held.

246
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,270
Really?

247
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,030
I was angry.

248
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,190
Well, we

249
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,510
stayed behind

250
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,270
and fought for so many days.
We're still alive.

251
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:05,750
However,

252
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,470
they believed that we're already dead.

253
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,550
You've been back for a long time.

254
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,070
Did you ever visit Gu Yiye?

255
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:28,710
What's wrong?

256
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,910
Gu Yiye.

257
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,990
Hands up! Don't move!

258
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,190
Hands up!

259
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,430
Hands up!

260
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,830
- Mancang! Mancang!
- Hands up!

261
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,590
I said hands up! Did you hear me?

262
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,070
I said hands up!

263
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:44,870
Mancang!

264
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,910
Mancang.

265
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,110
We're your allies, Mancang.

266
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,150
Mancang, calm down.

267
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,470
I'm Lu Pingfan.

268
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,630
Mancang, it's okay.

269
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,870
Mancang, put the gun down.

270
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,950
- It's okay, Mancang.
- Calm down.

271
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:56,950
It's okay.

272
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,630
It's okay.

273
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,310
Mancang, it's okay.

274
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:03,710
It's okay.

275
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:05,630
It's okay.

276
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:06,950
It's okay.

277
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,030
Ever since then,

278
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,070
I haven't seen him again.

279
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:23,670
I just heard

280
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,350
he's always in the dormitory.

281
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,350
He doesn't want to go out or see anyone.

282
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,150
I was worried about him.

283
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,030
I came to visit him

284
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,350
but he refused to see me.

285
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,030
After I was dispatched
to the Division Command

286
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,470
to help them make the martyr list,

287
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,070
I had no time to visit him again.

288
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:45,910
I don't know

289
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,510
what happened later, either.

290
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:49,350
Well,

291
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,270
others told me that

292
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,830
in order to protect him,

293
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,670
Platoon Leader Zhang Fei was blown up.

294
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,310
But at that time,

295
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,560
we were surrounded

296
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,190
by enemies in the ravine.

297
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,590
We couldn't move.

298
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,460
If he didn't

299
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,310
lead people of two squads back,

300
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,870
none of us would be able to return.

301
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,390
It's not his fault.

302
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,230
He reported the accident to the military
by himself.

303
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,110
Himself?

304
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,630
Was he insane?

305
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,380
He dwelt on it.

306
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,110
He said if he didn't insist

307
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,510
when Platoon Leader Zhang Fei

308
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:22,830
assigned tasks,

309
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,830
Platoon Leader Zhang Fei wouldn't go look for

310
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,430
missing people with others.

311
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,150
If he didn't move the plank,

312
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,750
Platoon Leader Zhang wouldn't be blown up

313
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,550
by the land mine for covering him.

314
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,630
He claimed that

315
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,710
Platoon Leader Zhang Fei died

316
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,870
because of him.

317
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,070
If this is the case,

318
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:45,670
I'm also guilty

319
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,870
because at that time,

320
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,670
I also insisted we should rescue people
instead of going back.

321
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,990
Why are you all like this?

322
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,750
I also feel terribly sad
about Platoon Leader Zhang's death.

323
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,950
I even dreamed of him for two days.

324
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,430
But if you all think that,

325
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,030
Platoon Leader Zhang's death will be a waste.

326
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,510
You don't have to comfort me.

327
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,750
I almost died once.

328
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,750
I know what death is.

329
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,550
You should comfort Yiye.

330
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,510
He needs you more than I need you.

331
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,510
Go talk to him.

332
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,030
But you're his best friend in the army.

333
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,990
But he likes you.

334
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,030
It's easier for you to persuade him.

335
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,030
OK.

336
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,950
After I return to the station,

337
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,190
I'll go visit him.

338
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,980
Go back early.

339
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,030
It's dark.

340
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,390
Take care.

341
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,840
I have to go.

342
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,350
OK.

343
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,420
I gotta go.

344
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,590
Jiang Nanzheng,

345
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:05,830
do you know that

346
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:07,670
I told myself

347
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,430
I would never tell anyone about this?

348
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,910
However,

349
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,790
when I held the Honor Grenade

350
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,240
and stood by the cliff...

351
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:21,150
When Niu and me ran in panic

352
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,870
in the unknown jungle...

353
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,390
When those bullets and shells

354
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,430
showered down around me...

355
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,150
I thought

356
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,710
if I could survive

357
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:31,510
and see you,

358
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:32,870
there would be no hesitations

359
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,190
in telling you,

360
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,030
"Jiang Nanzheng,

361
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,550
I also like you."

362
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,070
I fell in love with you

363
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,630
at first sight.

364
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,590
I know you have feelings for Gu Yiye

365
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:48,730
[People's Liberation Army]

366
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:45,870
and you won't like me.

367
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,350
I'm kind of

368
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:48,830
carrying a torch for you.

369
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:50,670
Anyway, it's okay.

370
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,150
As long as I'm not a bother...

371
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,550
As long as I can stay with you,

372
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,350
seeing you fall in love

373
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,190
and live a happy life,

374
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,240
it's okay.

375
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:11,630
♫ Yearning for you, watching over you ♫

376
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:17,970
♫ Yearning turns into winds.
Read my mind, read your mind. ♫

377
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:24,480
♫ Yearning for me, looking at me. ♫

378
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:33,310
♫ Time turns into flowers,
like you, like me. ♫

379
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:40,830

00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:53,970
Sit down.

568
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:05,730
Zhang Fei was your platoon leader.

569
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:08,490
You were there when he died.

570
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:10,650
You have to go.

571
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,210
No.

572
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:15,010
Anyone can go

573
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:16,770
except me.

574
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:20,490
Gu Yiye.

575
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,370
I can understand how you feel.

576
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:26,010
Everyone will feel terribly sad about it.

577
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,970
But we can't pretend
that nothing has happened.

578
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:31,290
We have to move on even if people died.

579
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,770
Three soldiers of the Ninth Squad died.

580
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,690
28 soldiers of the Third Platoon died.

581
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,410
Our company lost 75 soldiers in total.

582
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:42,610
If I act like you,

583
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,570
how to keep living in the world
as a company commander?

584
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:47,090
I've talked to the battalion.

585
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:48,530
The battalion replied that

586
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,010
notices of martyrs' deaths

587
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,450
should be sent in batches.

588
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,050
Don't tell people about it now.

589
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:56,610
Just say that combatants

590
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:58,010
will be dispatched by the army together.

591
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:01,730
But we have to visit their family.

592
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:03,730
His family is already at the door.

593
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:04,770
You can't pretend not to notice.

594
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:06,650
If this is the case,

595
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,650
you shouldn't have returned
from the battlefield.

596
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,210
Say something.

597
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:20,570
Where's the courage

598
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:21,890
you showed when you passed the blockade line

599
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,090
with others?

600
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:27,730
You have to go with me tonight.

601
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,450
Think it over here.

602
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:34,050
I'll go to the hospital to
visit the wounded of our company.

603
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:37,130
Call the hospital and come to see me
after you make a decision.

604
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,530
The quartermaster and me

605
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:51,730
are the only cadres left in our company.

606
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:55,770
You're the acting platoon leader
of the Third Platoon.

607
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,450
Continue being the acting platoon leader

608
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:00,210
until the formal organization is complete.

609
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,530
Soon some soldiers will receive merits.

610
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,130
You're smart. Think about it for me.

611
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:09,930
In our company,
whose names should be on the list?

612
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:18,050
I'm kind of resorting
to the carrot and stick approach.

613
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:19,850
It's just that...

614
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:25,930
It's just that
there are no other suitable candidates.

615
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:21,810
[Strengthen combat readiness.
Get ready to fight]

616
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:27,170
[Learn from Comrade Lei Feng. Mao Zedong]

617
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:40,690
[Strict discipline, invincible army,
tough soldiers, great physical fitness]

618
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:45,370
Gao, were you discharged from the hospital?

619
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:46,290
Yes.

620
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:47,650
I'll go visit the company commander first.

621
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:56,850
Company commander.

622
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:00,650
I'm back.
