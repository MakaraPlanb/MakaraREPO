1
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,500
Qin Dapao, listen.

2
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,300
I have my own principles.

3
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,220
Discipline should be kept.

4
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,740
Of course, sometimes, we can be flexible.

5
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,620
But

6
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,420
don’t bargain with me.

7
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,660
Why do we have to listen to you?

8
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,340
You have a lot of people.

9
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,980
None of you would admit
that you’ve eaten it?

10
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,730
Don’t make me look down on

11
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,780
you and your soldiers.

12
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,500
I’ll take responsibility for them. So what?

13
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,780
Enough. Stop it.

14
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,740
I’m going to find Niu Mancang.

15
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:11,900
Are you threatening me?

16
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,030
Why would I threaten you?

17
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:15,940
Do you know chalk from cheese?

18
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,300
Let me put it this way,

19
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,700
here are two choices for you.

20
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,900
First, impose punishments on one of you.

21
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,980
Second, impose punishments on two, three,

22
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,420
or four of you. You’ll be included.

23
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:28,900
Choose between them.

24
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,900
I told you

25
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,540
I’ll take responsibility.

26
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,860
Just punish me.

27
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,579
I already told you
this offer would be rejected.

28
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,940
Now there are

29
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:38,260
two choices for you.

30
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,579
Make a choice again.

31
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,740
It’s easy to choose between them, isn’t it?

32
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,500
Song Jianshe.

33
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,260
Stop fancying yourself as a smart guy.

34
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,140
I already told you

35
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,380
if you want to punish someone, just punish me.

36
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,620
I don’t want my soldiers to get involved.

37
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,420
Why are you so ruthless? Will it do you good?

38
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,460
You have no idea!

39
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,940
How stupid you are!

40
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,020
Company commander, don’t worry. I’m fine.

41
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,620
It’s no big deal.

42
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,500
I’m okay.

43
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:49,740
[Confinement Room]

44
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,460
Please take a seat.

45
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,540
Chief Song, sorry,
I made trouble for you again.

46
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,420
Our deputy company commander told me

47
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,820
it’s pretty serious.

48
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,420
But I don’t think so.

49
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,500
I killed a villager’s pig.

50
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,500
Let’s compensate him.

51
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,020
I’ll give him all my stipends.

52
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,380
Besides, Chief Song, you’re nice.

53
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,180
You have your own principles
but you always treat others humanely.

54
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,140
You seem to be strict
but you only inflict mild punishments.

55
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,420
You care about your soldiers.

56
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,140
No way.

57
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,140
What do you mean?

58
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,460
This time I won’t be merciful.

59
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,380
Why?

60
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,340
What happened today

61
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,820
is like a fire.

62
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,420
I believe some people will be affected.

63
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,020
The commander of the military district

64
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,180
has already given instructions to us.

65
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,780
We have to find negative models.

66
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,420
It’s me, right?

67
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,580
Will I be jailed for catching the pig?

68
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,860
No, you won’t.

69
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,060
But you’ll be discharged from the army.

70
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,420
Well,

71
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,460
I have a question for you.

72
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,620
Now you have to tell the truth

73
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:05,820
to me.

74
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,780
It was proposed by me.

75
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,940
It’s my idea.

76
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,100
It has nothing to do with them.

77
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,780
I mean the truth.

78
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,260
Loyalty

79
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,300
and friendship.

80
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,380
Some people like to
talk about these two things

81
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,340
but I’m not interested.

82
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,980
Don’t treat the discipline of the army
like it’s nothing

83
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,260
for protecting others.

84
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,460
Did you hear me?

85
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,060
Who can I protect?

86
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,540
What about Gu Yiye?

87
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,820
No way.

88
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:32,620
Chief Song,

89
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,460
how can I protect him?

90
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,500
We’re in the same boat. Listen,

91
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,900
he’s always so arrogant.

92
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,900
Everyone is sick of him.
I’m sick to death of him.

93
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,140
Think about the way he usually behaves.

94
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,780
I don’t even want to talk to him.

95
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,620
Stand up.

96
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,750
Stand up!

97
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:52,740
Sit here.

98
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,340
Gu Yiye

99
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,980
lives next door.

100
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,060
I spoke to him just now.

101
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,340
He said it was proposed by him, right?

102
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,860
I can guess the answer straight away.

103
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,620
He’s stubborn.

104
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,700
No.

105
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,940
He said

106
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,840
he didn’t propose killing the pig

107
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,660
but he killed the pig with you.

108
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,220
Is there any difference?

109
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,100
Of course there is.

110
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,380
Sit down.

111
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,100
Sit down.

112
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,620
You want to take overall responsibility,

113
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,300
right?

114
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,020
But Gu Yiye said

115
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,580
he killed the pig with you.

116
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,580
You two will share the responsibility.

117
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,340
They’re different.

118
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,140
Please note that

119
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,060
if you approve your testimony,

120
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,140
you’ll have no chance to
compete with him in the future.

121
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,140
Listen to me carefully.

122
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,220
It’s not that you’ll have no chance to win.

123
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,420
It’s that you’ll have no chance
to compete with him.

124
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,260
Before you put on the military uniform,

125
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,220
you were able to regret the things you did.

126
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,140
However, now you’re in the uniform.

127
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,660
You should try to

128
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,540
resolve issues.

129
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,380
Dad,

130
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,380
I believe
Gao Liang will take overall responsibility.

131
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,340
Should I also take responsibility?

132
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,620
I’ve already taught this to you.

133
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,180
What do you think?

134
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,260
I got it.

135
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,460
Emotionally, trust Gao Liang.

136
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,700
Tactically,

137
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,300
always leave some leeway.

138
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,460
Correct.

139
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,180
But it’s very boring

140
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,900
and disgusting.

141
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,060
Do you want to do the right thing

142
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,020
or something that seems to be good?

143
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,180
I got it.

144
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,940
To people, important things are

145
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:54,740
love

146
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,060
friendship,

147
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,540
loyalty

148
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,140
and dignity.

149
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,460
But to a strategist,

150
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,220
all of them can be put aside.

151
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,620
Do you want to be Xiang Yu
who committed suicide by the Wu River

152
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,340
or Goujian who ate dirt

153
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,900
to take his revenge?

154
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,140
You don’t have to be a hero

155
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,300
but you have to be a winner

156
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,860
because you’re a soldier.

157
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,100
Come on.

158
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,940
Let me get it straight for you.

159
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,300
After it happened,

160
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,220
Gu Yiye behaved himself.

161
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,900
He insisted
he would take half of the responsibility.

162
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,630
Qin Hanyong was patching things up
on a matter of principle,

163
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,179
but I have to think of a way
to resolve the issue.

164
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,860
As your direct supervisor, Qin Hanyong

165
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,100
should also take responsibility.

166
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,470
Gu Yiye and you

167
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,180
will share the responsibility.

168
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,860
I’m

169
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,210
kind of

170
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,940
unlucky.

171
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,580
I’ll write a review,
hand it to my supervisor

172
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,540
and make an apology.

173
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,390
Chief Song.

174
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,510
I think…

175
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,620
You’d better come down to earth.

176
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,500
Ten years ago,

177
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,820
I would do the same thing as you.

178
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,980
I would take overall responsibility.

179
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,740
However, I regretted it later.

180
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,900
If you do it,

181
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,140
I believe you’ll regret it in the future.

182
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,540
Even if I’ll regret it,

183
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,140
I can’t hurt others.

184
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,060
We all did that on a voluntary basis.

185
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,300
No one got hurt because of what you said

186
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,920
except yourself.

187
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,900
Do you remember

188
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,740
the song that Gu Yiye sang at the night

189
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,820
before new recruits left the company?

190
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:52,740
Do you remember it?

191
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,620
I also sang it.

192
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,260
It doesn’t matter.

193
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,980
You always compete with others.

194
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,300
I mean before he sang the song, he said

195
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,020
soldiers

196
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,180
should protect people who love them

197
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,720
and who they love.

198
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,660
I think there’s one more thing.

199
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,370
They should also protect themselves.

200
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:22,880
Chief Song,

201
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,740
I understand what you mean.

202
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,740
You’re trying to help me.

203
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,420
You want me to agree with Gu Yiye
on what he said

204
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,660
and tell a lie.

205
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,140
But actually, telling a lie

206
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,220
will not

207
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,820
do others any harm.

208
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,420
And I’ll be able to save myself.

209
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,100
Yeah, right.

210
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:46,820
Sounds

211
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,900
great.

212
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,700
But if I do that today,

213
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,940
it’ll haunt me all my life.

214
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,060
The last ten seconds.

215
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,500
Please note that

216
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,220
you’re different from Gu Yiye.

217
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,220
There’s no turning back for you.

218
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,500
Both of you stick to your rules

219
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,300
and demand justice,

220
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:13,940
but

221
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,540
you have to pay a lot more than he does.

222
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,380
If he molts,

223
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,700
you’ll have to
crush your body and shatter your bones.

224
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,700
Being a winner is harder than being a hero.

225
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,620
It’s not difficult to take the right step

226
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,060
as long as you want to take it.

227
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,980
But it’s difficult to

228
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,100
take all the right steps in decades

229
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,780
because it requires you to
confront your nature

230
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,460
and throw away
all the emotions and weaknesses

231
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,860
that ordinary people have.

232
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,220
Dad,

233
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,500
can I make a mistake sometimes?

234
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,140
No.

235
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,060
Even if someone wins 20 games in a row,

236
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,540
he’ll lose everything

237
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,740
as long as he loses one game.

238
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,780
Now you

239
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,100
insist you take overall responsibility.

240
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:12,860
About him,

241
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,980
even if he insists he take half of
the responsibility,

242
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,120
he’ll be released soon.

243
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,840
But what about you?

244
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,750
No one can save you.

245
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,420
Do you understand?

246
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,540
Chief Song.

247
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,460
Thank you.

248
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,740
But

249
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,140
I can’t do that.

250
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:42,920
I’ll take overall responsibility.

251
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,900
Otherwise, how to prove that

252
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,370
I’m better than all of them?

253
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,030
Right?

254
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,780
Then good luck.

255
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,780
[Rules of Food Usage]

256
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,340
Company commander.

257
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,540
Hail, division commander.

258
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,340
It’s only been half a month.

259
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,620
Look. There’s little food.

260
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,300
We have to rely on it
until the end of this month.

261
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,420
The food is enough for other companies.

262
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,300
Why is it not enough for your company?

263
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,160
Because they’re not backward company.

264
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,380
They don’t have to earn a reputation

265
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,940
by spending more time
on the training ground.

266
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,820
The more they practice, the more they eat, right?

267
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,100
Then how to complete the Long March?

268
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,060
Are you a ruffian soldier of the old society?

269
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,140
You bled and sweated at the front

270
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,300
so you robbed people of their food, right?

271
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,020
We were completely unaware.

272
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,820
You don’t have to take the opportunity
to give us a hard time, do you?

273
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,740
Give you a hard time?

274
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,540
Gao Liang killed someone’s pig, didn’t he?

275
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,660
Did I wrong him?

276
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,300
What’s the song that you learned

277
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,900
on your first day in the army?

278
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,340
Three Disciplines and Eight Notes.

279
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,700
We can’t even take a needle from people,

280
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,940
let alone a pig.

281
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,380
Division commander,

282
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,700
Gao Liang really didn’t know

283
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,700
the pig belonged to someone.

284
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,420
He thought it’s a wild boar.

285
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,300
Wild boar?

286
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,820
Division commander, the trap was there.

287
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,090
In the deep woods,

288
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,500
a pig suddenly appeared.

289
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,980
And it was dark at that time.

290
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,760
People all hurried to

291
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,740
get the pig out.

292
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,160
Who could know

293
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,030
it’s a swine pig?

294
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,340
That kid

295
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,500
is really good at digging holes.

296
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,940
He found such a place.

297
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,060
He’s an expert.

298
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,900
An expert is going to be fired.

299
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,220
Why is it so hard for me

300
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,580
to do everything?

301
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,580
It’s okay.
I can take off the military uniform

302
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,580
and go back to fix the Earth.

303
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,100
What?

304
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,940
Are you threatening me?

305
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,310
No.

306
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,540
I dare not do it.

307
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,340
I just want to tell you

308
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,820
even if I’ll be demoted
to platoon leader, sergeant

309
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,580
or new recruit, it’s okay.

310
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,700
Please do not punish Gao Liang.

311
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,660
It’s not his fault.

312
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,020
You turned from a ruffian soldier
into a warlord, didn’t you?

313
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,940
Are you helping your friend?

314
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,460
Listen, Qin Hanyong,

315
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,700
it’s the revolutionary army.

316
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,300
You don’t have a chance to do that.

317
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,500
Did you hear it?

318
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,860
Yes, I heard it.

319
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:42,980
Division commander,

320
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:43,940
there’s a wild boar.

321
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,500
Hu.

322
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,500
Hu!

323
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,180
Division commander, you’re amazing!

324
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,620
You’re able to kill a pig?

325
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,780
So easy.

326
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:04,980
When I was a new recruit,

327
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,900
I learned how to kill a pig
from my company commander.

328
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,940
- Therefore, the army is a big school.
- Come on. Hurry up.

329
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,580
I’ve been a soldier for almost 30 years.

330
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,860
I can do anything

331
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,780
except giving birth to a baby.

332
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,890
- Division commander.
- Division commander.

333
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,740
Why didn’t you tell me that you’re here?

334
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,020
You came here in time.

335
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,260
Do something.

336
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,820
Soldiers are tired after the training.

337
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:25,940
Come on.

338
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,260
Help me put the pig on the table.

339
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:28,620
- Hurry up.
- Yes.

340
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:28,900
Leave it to us.

341
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:29,700
No.

342
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,860
Go back to take a rest.

343
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,580
Let’s eat pork at night. Go back now.

344
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,220
- Yes. Gather, everyone.
- You can go.

345
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,820
- Come on.
- Come on. Let’s do it.

346
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,460
Cadres, come here.

347
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,500
Hurry up.

348
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,500
Remove the hook.

349
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,420
One, two, three.

350
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,940
Chen Dashan,

351
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,660
tomorrow,

352
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,660
send cars to the division’s farm
to transport 10,000 kilos of rice,

353
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,260
and over 10 pigs.

354
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,500
Do a survey.

355
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,420
See

356
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,260
if any company is short of food.

357
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,340
Just give the food to them.

358
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:55,460
Yes.

359
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,780
Gosh!

360
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,540
Division commander,

361
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,060
how generous you are!

362
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,100
It’s not free.

363
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,460
Your Regiment 720’s

364
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,740
training has to reach a higher level.

365
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,339
Don’t be the last one in every test.

366
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,540
You score 0 point.

367
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,420
It’s humiliating, right?

368
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,500
I promise I’ll complete the task!

369
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,540
Song Jianshe.

370
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,339
Yes.

371
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:16,220
Your Military Affairs Unit

372
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,180
just stiffly followed the rules.

373
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,900
There’s a lack of knowledge
about the cause and the effect.

374
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,619
You mishandled the issue.

375
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:23,140
I suggest that

376
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,420
you reconsider the punishment for Gao Liang.

377
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:27,660
Division commander,

378
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,140
the punishment that inflicted
by the Military Affairs Unit

379
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,860
is in conformity with the regulations.

380
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,100
Besides,
our investigation is complete and accurate.

381
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,620
If you want us to investigate again,

382
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,580
there has to be solid evidence.

383
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,500
Otherwise,

384
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:39,660
the punishment cannot be changed.

385
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,460
Song Jianshe.

386
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,100
Yes.

387
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,260
You’re tougher than Qin Hanyong.

388
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:43,900
Division commander,

389
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,100
I’ve always been a tough guy.

390
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:45,700
Song Jianshe!

391
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,670
Division commander,

392
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,690
I know about it.

393
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,380
You can’t blame Song Jianshe.

394
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,540
The military district directly ordered him
to do that.

395
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,820
There’s a great deal of pressure on him.

396
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,300
Jianshe dares not neglect it.

397
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,580
Gao Liang is a naughty boy.

398
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,460
He made a mistake before.

399
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,620
He’s almost discharged from the army
during the last exercise.

400
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,820
Besides,
his physical fitness is not very good.

401
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:09,700
Well,

402
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,900
the kid who performed well
in the night shooting last time

403
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,740
is not Gao Liang.

404
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:13,860
His name is Gu Yiye.

405
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,980
He’s also involved in that matter.

406
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:16,540
Anyway,

407
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,780
he’s not the mastermind.

408
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,460
Think. People

409
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,540
are different.

410
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,500
You’re talking nonsense!

411
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,140
What’s wrong with soldiers
who don’t have good physical fitness?

412
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,340
Do they have to die?

413
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:27,740
No.

414
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,180
Lei Feng. Dong Cunrui.

415
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,380
If they’re in your regiment,

416
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,340
will you be able to
find that they’re good soldiers?

417
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,660
Today I’m gonna protect him.

418
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,420
Dispatch him to my office.

419
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,060
Let him be my public servant.

420
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,180
No, division commander,

421
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:39,940
he…

422
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,420
Let me set an example to you.

423
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,260
I’ll show you how to train soldiers.

424
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,180
[Be frugal and against waste.]

425
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,500
Comrades,

426
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,220
this is Jiang Nanzheng.
She’s from the Communication Company.

427
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,820
She’s lucky today.

428
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,100
She can feast on pork with us.

429
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,900
Great!

430
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,020
Today, there are two pieces of good news.

431
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,540
First,

432
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,180
during the field combined training,

433
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,900
Commander Zhao Hongying and me

434
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,460
held a paring event.

435
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,980
Today, she’s here to send the report.

436
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,500
The report is also a letter of challenge

437
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,740
so we have to practice more

438
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,900
and reply to the female soldiers.

439
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:28,980
Sir!

440
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:29,980
Sir!

441
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,580
I want to be the messenger.

442
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,300
Sir, please let old soldiers have a try.

443
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,340
Sir, new recruits can’t do that.
Let us have a try.

444
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,220
Enough.

445
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,580
Jiang Nanzheng

446
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,620
got this opportunity
because she’s the training pacesetter

447
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,300
of the Communication Company.

448
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,620
If you want to

449
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,180
send letters to female soldiers,

450
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,660
show me your achievements.

451
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,780
The second piece of good news is that

452
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:52,820
our division commander

453
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,620
will take his team

454
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,620
to inspect our company.

455
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,740
Guys,

456
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,180
greet them warmly
and behave yourselves later.

457
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,300
Yes!

458
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,860
Stand up, everyone!

459
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,820
Good.

460
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,780
Where are people who killed the pig just now?

461
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,780
Sir!

462
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,900
Hail, chief!

463
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:36,980
Let’s shake hands.

464
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,020
Chief, thank you!

465
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,340
Chief, thank you.

466
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,100
Why is there a female soldier?

467
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,740
Chief,

468
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,540
she’s the training pacesetter
of the Communication Company.

469
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,860
She’s here to pair with us.

470
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,340
Training pacesetter?

471
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,860
What’s your name?

472
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,980
Chief, my name is…

473
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,740
Jiang Nanzheng!

474
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,460
You seem to be popular
with soldiers of the Ninth Company.

475
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,140
Division commander, can we start to eat?
Please advise us.

476
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:02,820
Let’s get started.

477
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:03,700
Yes.

478
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,580
Smell good, right?

479
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,900
Yeah, the best.

480
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,060
Thanks, division commander.

481
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,780
- Have some more. Don’t starve yourselves. - Okay.

482
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,460
Nanzheng.

483
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,660
Have some more.

484
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,300
Don’t starve yourself.

485
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,620
Thanks, division commander.

486
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:26,980
Taste good.

487
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:28,980
Mancang,

488
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,780
chief is here.

489
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,100
Jiang is sitting next to him.

490
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,140
Keep it down.

491
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,620
Commander Qin said that

492
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,460
Gao Liang is still grounded.

493
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,460
Don’t worry.

494
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,780
Chief is not always here.

495
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,020
I’m sure that

496
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,180
Qin Dapao will not miss the chance.

497
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,900
Hail, chief.

498
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,610
Go ahead and eat.

499
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,460
Have some more. Don’t starve yourself.

500
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,300
- Okay.
- Thanks chief.

501
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,220
Have some more.

502
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,340
Smell good, right?

503
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,540
That’s right.

504
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,820
Oh my goodness.

505
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,940
That smells so good.

506
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,540
Come on, chief.

507
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,420
Stop.

508
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,580
They are not for you.

509
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,620
They are for the cooks and duty officers.

510
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:23,900
Qin Hanyong.

511
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:24,810
Yes sir.

512
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,660
Replace these dishes

513
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,540
with comrades’ daily ones,

514
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,900
regular dishes.

515
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,020
Yes sir.

516
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,300
Division commander.

517
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,340
Nanzheng.

518
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:40,620
What’s wrong?

519
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,140
Have some more.

520
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,500
This meat is the best.

521
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,940
How come you don’t eat some?

522
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,340
I’m not hungry.

523
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,020
It seems that you have lots of leisure time.

524
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,420
Nothing compares to the Training Company.

525
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,580
Check them out.

526
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,380
It will not be enough even butchering another pig.

527
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,220
Listen.

528
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,180
After the meal, we’ll have a meeting tonight

529
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,980
till 12 o’clock in the evening.

530
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,820
Nobody’s going to say that they are hungry.

531
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,020
Why do you stop?

532
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,180
Eat up.

533
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,420
I’m done.

534
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,660
I’m done.

535
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:13,700
I’m full.

536
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,500
I’m full.

537
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,540
Nonsense.

538
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,500
A pig weighing one to two kilograms,

539
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,820
and struggling for hours,

540
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,020
taking the breath out of you.

541
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,420
You call it “full”?

542
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,180
Comrades,

543
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,580
I always focus on your training,

544
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,500
instead of daily lives.

545
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,500
These days,

546
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,940
I’ve been such bureaucratic

547
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,340
and starved you all.

548
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,220
I apologize.

549
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,460
I promise that

550
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,780
I’ll change from now on.

551
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,980
I’ll not leave you starving.

552
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,140
You can learn the skills

553
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,820
of protecting our country with strengths.

554
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,380
I hope that you can all work hard,

555
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,980
just as this little female soldier,

556
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,140
and be the model soldier in the training ground.

557
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,540
Okay.

558
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,540
If you’re full, then let’s go.

559
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,340
Stand up.

560
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,180
Qin Hanyong.

561
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:32,740
Yes sir.

562
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,580
Take a bowl of braised pork with dark soy sauce

563
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,900
to Gao Liang.

564

756

Let me do a little introduction.

757
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,140
This is my new public servant.

758
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,140
How is him?

759
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,860
Handsome, huh?

760
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,500
Don’t hurry to clean that dirt.

761
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,860
You’ve got all dirty.

762
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,860
Tell political commissar,

763
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,700
where are you from?

764
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,080

00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,380
I’m from Regiment 720.

How long did you walk?

767
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,220
I walked over half a day.

768
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,140
My car broke down twice on the way,

769
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,540
or I would have been here before noon.

770
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,260
You heard that, political commissar?

771
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,020
Over 60 kilometers,

772
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,380

774
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,900
How can I not be so angry?

775
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,460
If that can solve the problem,

776
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,460
I’ll do it with you,

777
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,700

can the divisional Communist Party Committee

00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:40,800

791
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,940
I got here after I was a new recruit.

00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,020
You are transferred from frontline Training Company.

793
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,740
I hope you can infect me

799
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,860
I’ve got it organized

800
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:13,659
so you can start with ease.

801
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,460

802
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,699
get up at five thirty everyday

803
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,940
and change the water from yesterday.

804
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:20,860
Division commander likes to read and sleep late.

805
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:21,820
You need to get exactly on time

806
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,340
and wake commander up at six twenty-five.

807
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,780
He has simple food so he doesn’t go to canteen.

808
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,139
Get him a steamed bun,

an egg, and a bottle of water.

810
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,380
He reads the materials in the morning.

811
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,940
Give him the breakfast when he gets in the car.

812
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:30,860

814
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,780
The division commander never really had a meal,

815
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:36,460

Not you, it’s a comrade friend of mine.

829
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,140
His name is Gu Yiye, really dumb.

830
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,500

937
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:39,300
Colonel of Regiment 700

00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,580

is connecting with the Sixth Company, Regiment 720.

941
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,420
Wrong.

942
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,580
You were connecting to the Ninth Company.

943
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,260
The Third Battalion, Regiment 720, disconnected.

944
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,500

is connecting with the Second Battalion, Regiment 702.

947
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,660
Wrong. You were connecting to the Ninth Company again.

948
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,020
Number two chief

949
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,220

00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,980
is connecting with the Second Company, Regiment 720.

954
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:21,740
Stop.

955
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,020
Six minutes and thirty-five seconds.

956
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,500
Three mistakes.

957
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,420
Jiang Nanzheng,

958
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,340
this is not you.

959
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,500
What’s wrong with you?

960
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,740
You’re clearly absent-minded today.

961
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,180
What happened?

962
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,940
Are you sure to let her take the honor?

963
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:52,940
Yeah.

964
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,820
Commander,

965
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,420
although she scored less

966
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,500
than Song Xiaoluo today,

967
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,740
Song Xiaoluo has practiced for three years

968
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,460
while Jiang Nanzheng, three months only.

969
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,100
She’s amazing.

970
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,500
Really potential.

971
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,820
I’m aware of that.

972
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,700
But what happened to

973
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,380
Jiang Nanzheng today?

974
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,020
I should take the blame.

975
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,660
Recently,

976
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:15,660
I assigned the health work of the battalion

977
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,100
to the squad.

978
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,500
They have issues with me.

979
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,610
That’s taken out on me.

980
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,340
But no worries.

981
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,660
I’ll deal with it.

982
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,500
Giving this to Jiang Nanzheng

983
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,940
means that you give up

984
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,140
the seat of promoting cadre.

985
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,140
Do you know how scarce

986
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,220
this kind of opportunity is?

987
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,540
I know.

988
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,940
Therefore, unless you take the examination

989
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,770
to promote cadre in the future,

990
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,540
this will be your last chance

991
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,780
to fight for it.

992
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,020
Are you sure about that?

993
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,100
I’m the sergeant.

994
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,740
That’s what I ought to do.

995
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,700
That’s not what a sergeant has to do.

996
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,580
Company commander,

997
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:03,660
the competition in the army

998
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,300
aims at selecting the best soldier.

999
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,060
Jiang Nanzheng, with her gift

1000
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,500
and more hard work,

1001
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,820
will definitely surpass me in no time.

1002
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,380
I’ll have a lot of trouble with my ego

1003
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,300
if stifling her like this.

1004
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:22,710
Company commander,

1005
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,220
you know...

1006
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,620
I may not be the best,

1007
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,300
but I have my pride,

1008
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,380
my dignity

1009
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,020
will not allow me for doing this.

1010
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:41,100
[Raise vigilance, defend the motherland, be strict with requirements, and make solid preparations.]

1011
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,380
Stand up.

1012
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:45,180
[United and tense, serious and lively. ]

1013
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:46,760
Sit down.

1014
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,550
Now I’d like to make an announcement.

1015
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,020
According to the research decision of company party branch,

1016
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,510
and the consent of Regimental Communist Party Committee,

1017
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:58,030
comrades Song Xiaoluo and Jiang Nanzheng were selected as

1018
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,050
the reserve members of our company

1019
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,980
to participate in this telecommunication contest of

1020
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,600
the military district.
