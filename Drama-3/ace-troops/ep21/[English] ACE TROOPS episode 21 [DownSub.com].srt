[Episode 21]

4
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:49,539
Hello.

5
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,520
Yiye, the prizes of Regiment 720

6
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,320
have been revealed.

7
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,560
You are rewarded as a “Combat Hero”,

8
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,960
and Gao Liang won the First-Class Merit.

9
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,560
The Prize-giving Ceremony

10
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,759
will be hold by the division headquarter.

11
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,200
Yiye, I’m so happy for you.

12
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,480
What about our platoon leader?

13
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,040
What prize did he win?

14
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,120
What?

15
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,680
What about Zhao Hongliu,

16
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,560
Shu Jiagui,

17
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,800
Sergeant Mao,

18
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,040
and all our comrades that have been sacrificed?

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,160
What prizes did they win?

20
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,900
[Raise vigilance, defend the motherland.]

21
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,800
Yiye,

22
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,960
you need to stop that. The past is the past.

23
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,760
You need to face the reality and live the future.

24
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,360
Or else the comrades

25
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,360
were sacrificed for nothing.

26
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,880
What’s reality?

27
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,360
Keep studying.

28
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,079
And be a more powerful soldier

29
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,200
that you’ve always dreamed of.

30
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,880
I’ll do the same.

31
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:08,420
[Carry every red flag.]

32
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,360
She was so reasonable,

33
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,000
and so brave.

34
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,600
She practically thought of everything,

35
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,920
except for

36
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,079
the leaving of our platoon leader.

37
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,760
It’s not that she did not think of it.

38
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,079
Instead, she would never want to think of it that way.

39
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
Neither would I.

40
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,079
Platoon leader will be in front of me

41
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,440
once I close my eyes.

42
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,560
I’m afraid.

43
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,640
I have no idea what to do.

44
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,960
I have no idea how to end this.

45
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,840
Afraid.

46
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,480
I’m afraid as well.

47
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,760
I’ve been afraid.

48
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,400
I had a hunch that

49
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,070
there’s a chance

50
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,480
I could never see anything I was familiar with,

51
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,480
and could never come back to my beloved army.

52
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,280
When I was in the mountain

53
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,320
and injured,

54
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,040
I was more frightened than ever.

55
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,760
I felt so wronged.

56
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,200
I kept running in the mountain,

57
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,760
just like running for my life.

58
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,159
I ran to the end of the road,

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,040
and took out

60
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,800
the death bomb

61
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,120
and the white rabbit rolls.

62
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,400
That’s when I knew

63
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,159
it was the last minute of my life.

64
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,320
Bro,

65
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,080
and then I started crying,

66
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,240
crying like

67
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,400
a shameless bastard.

68
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,720
But suddenly,

69
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,040
I came to realize that

70
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,400
I did what we had to do

71
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,000
just like my brother.

72
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,800
Nobody was there to stop me.

73
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,240
I calmed myself down right away.

74
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,080
I was not scared anymore,

75
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,960
with nothing but just one faith

76
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,520
which was the last think I did

77
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,880
was killing

78
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,520
all the enemies standing in my way.

79
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,520
Go check on Jiang Nanzheng.

80
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,760
She misses you.

81
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,520
So much

82
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,160
that she doesn’t know how to face you.

83
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,040
She loves you.

84
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,360
You owe her.

85
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,320
Gao Liang.

86
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,760
That’s none of your business.

87
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,800
You care no one but yourself,

88
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,160
your pain, your despair.

89
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,480
What about her?

90
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,080
Yes.

91
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,760
You saved 26 comrades

92
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,520
from the battlefield,

93
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,880
which, for no doubt, a heroic gesture.

94
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,360
It was your day of triumph.

95
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,640
But don’t forget

96
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,280
she was the one who got the artillery regiment on line

97
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,680
which ensured our artillery support.

98
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,440
She was the one who intercepted the messages of the enemies

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,960
which made the superior placed orders for firing,

100
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,360
which also saved your own life.

101
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,920
She was the one who saved us all.

102
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,560
She saved Regiment 720,

103
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,760
instead of you.

104
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,520
What...

105
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,800
What right do you have to be mad at her?

106
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:34,840
Yiye.

107
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,800
Why are you here?

108
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,440
Did you just run for dozens of kilometers?

109
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,960
Look at your sweat.

110
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,920
Nanzheng.

111
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,400
Why don’t you beat me up?

112
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,320
What?

113
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,640
I’ll feel better if you beat me up.

114
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,840
Why are you so funny?

115
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,040
Is that what you want to say to me

116
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,159
all the way running here?

117
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,640
Yiye, what are you doing?

118
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,160
Who’s there?

119
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,680
They’ve just come back from the frontline.

120
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,840
They’ve practically died once.

121
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,520
Let it go.

122
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,320
What’s the matter?

123
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,240
Nanzheng.

124
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,640
I’m such a bastard.

125
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,280
I should not treat you like that.

126
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,840
Did Gao Liang tell you something?

127
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,549
No matter what Gao Liang told me,

128
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:39,789
it was all my fault.

129
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,600
I should not treat you like that. I’m a bastard.

130
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,040
Nanzheng,

131
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,800
forgive me.

132
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,160
Let it go.

133
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,880
It’s cold outside at night.

134
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,920
Put on a coat, or you’ll catch a cold.

135
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,800
Did I just scare you?

136
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,560
Does it hurt?

137
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,120
It doesn’t matter.

138
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,640
Surviving from the battlefield,

139
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,280
it’s not the injuries

140
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,240
or the pain that hurts the most.

141
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,560
It’s regret.

142
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,880
Regrets for those comrades

143
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,480
whose lives could have been saved but failed.

144
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,600
I know you’re upset.

145
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,520
But we need to stop thinking about things that happened in the battlefield.

146
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,240
Nanzheng,

147
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,680
you know what?

148
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,680
In the battlefield,

149
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,280
when facing the extreme despair,

150
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,320
someone stepped ahead

151
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,520
and took the bullet for you,

152
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,600
sacrificing their lives for yours.

153
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,880
From then on,

154
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,600
your life had changed.

155
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,480
Everything had changed.

156
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,760
You tell me,

157
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,240
how can I stop thinking of it?

158
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:24,880
I understand.

159
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,320
But since we survived from the war

160
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,000
safe and sound,

161
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,000
we should re-live

162
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,400
our lives.

163
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,400
You know...

164
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,080
When I was in the battlefield,

165
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,720
in the life-or-death moment,

166
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,800
the first person came into my mind

167
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,160
was you.

168
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,280
It’s nice you’re here.

169
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,440
Watch the stars with me.

170
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,840
Talk to them.

171
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,600
I always have a feeling that

172
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,480
the comrades that left us

173
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,000
would go there

174
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,280
and watch us from the sky.

175
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,880
They’re watching us to be better men.

176
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,920
Learning to accept losing the beloved ones,

177
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,520
and accept the imperfections in life

178
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,040
or the regrets in life

179
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,320
is a lesson we all have to learn.

180
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,800
No one can escape from that.

181
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,600
In fact, our regiment

182
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,440
should thank you.

183
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,200
You saved most of us.

184
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,440
But I wanted to save more.

185
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,480
I would never forget

186
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,160
when Xialin asked Sergeant Han, crying,

187
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,520
whether there was radio that would not be broken.

188
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,880
Is there radio that would not be smashed?

189
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,800
Is there any radio?

190
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,560
Is there radio that would not be smashed?

191
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,920
I always feel that

they would not die

193
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,600
if our connections could go through faster.

194
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,400

195
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,560

197
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,600
But we will never compromise.

198
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,240
I believe that in the near future,

199
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,360
as the development of technologies such as modern electronics,

202
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,160
will definitely usher in a new era.

Hu Yang is in America, right?

206

Have you two been in touch?

207
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,480
She wrote to me before. What’s wrong?

208
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,840
That’s great!

209
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,760

named Beckwith.

214
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,320
It’s mainly about special operations.

Take it, take it.

216
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,680
We should not experience all those things

217
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,040
in the battlefield for nothing.

218
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,960

Do you know why I gather you here

228
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,520
in the room of Company History?

229
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,800
Today is a memorable day.

230

Our army, that has experienced gunfire

231
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,920
and countless tests,

232
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,880
will have major changes soon.

The unprecedented disarmament.

234
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,640
Our filed army that is mostly infantry

235
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,000
will be reorganized into a group army

236
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,840
with combined forces of different arms.

237
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,920
The gunfire, assault fire and mobility

238
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,360
of the group army will be improved dramatically.

239
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,040
Our ability for combined training and combating

under modern conditions

241
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,600

The selection of talents

243

The personnel development of the army

247
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,080
is the top priority.

248
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,560
Even me can sense the crisis.

249
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,920
Commander,

250
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,000
does it mean that

251
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,160
we will be promoted in no time?

252
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,920
More or less.

253
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,800
You need to face the reality and live the future.

254
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,160
What’s reality?

255
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,240

The comrades that had outstanding performances in the battle

259
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,720
will have the chance to study in the academy.

260
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:12,880

264

00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,520
That goes without saying.

00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,120
I was the first place

00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,520
in the democratic appraisal of the company.

Not far from Army Academy.

00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,720
Dozens of miles maybe.

355
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,800
I made up my mind

356
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,200
owing to what you said about military communication technology earlier.

357
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,160
I will not sing anymore.

358
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,800
The army has a full capacity of singers.

359
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,440
Gao Liang will be so sad.

360
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,640
Your songs make us happy.

361
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,360
Which academy are you going to study in?

362
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,400
Engineering Academy.

363
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,160
Why?

364
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,640
Engineering Academy is great.

365
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,160
Most of the students in other academies are from official families.

366
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,480
They think that they are superior to others.

367
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,360
They’re just showing off.

368
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,360
Just like Gu Yiye, right?

369
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,840
It’s different in Engineering Academy.

370
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,400
I was born from farmer’s family.

371
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,840
I have real skills on me,

372
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:00,720
right?

373
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,960
Who’s there to show off in front of me?

374
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,000
I’ve checked it out.

375
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,280
The ration allowance in Engineering Academy

376
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,760
is higher as well.

377
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,560
24.5 kilograms a month.

378
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,560
I don’t assume you just go to this academy for ration allowance only.

379
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,680
Engineering Academy is far from Communication Academy.

380
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,920
Stop guessing. Give it to me.

381
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,080
Can you carry it?

382
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,680
That’s fine.

383
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,840
What about you?

384
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,280
We are nowhere compared to your combat company.

385
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:23,960
No quota for us.

386
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,400
I...

387
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,560
just won the Third-class Merit. Not a chance.

388
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,160
Sergeant Han.

389
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,240
Coming.

390
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,880
I’ll go there.

391
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,480
Why are you two sitting down here?

392
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,480
Hurry up and do the job.

393
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,320
- Or else you’ll miss the meal. - Shh.

394
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,000
What’s there to shush about? Hurry up!

395
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,920
Move it.

396
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,160
Stop talking.

397
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,640
What’s wrong?

398
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,240
Mancang delivered the mail here just now.

399
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,200
Xiu found out the fact that

400
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,160
platoon leader Zhang has died.

401
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,480
They told you to hurry back.

402
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,600
Xiu is going back to eastern Guangdong tomorrow.

403
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,640
Comrade Xiu

404
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,960
will not come over.

405
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,320
Didn’t she agree to come over

406
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,400
and check out where leader of the Third Platoon once lived and trained?

407
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,480
What’s there to see?

408
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,640
He was not there anymore.

409
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,320
Wouldn’t she be more upset

410
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,600
seeing the empty beds?

411
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,200
She heard that there were only 27 soldiers in the whole company,

412
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,480
and there’s a dozen of them who have not been discharged yet.

413
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,160
They would be more upset

414
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,000
seeing her there.

415
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,400
The army approved

416
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,800
the application of Xiu,

417
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,640
and bringing home the bone ash of the leader of the Third Platoon.

418
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,160
I’m thinking that

419
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,680
she will be all alone on her way home.

420
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,400
You send

421
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,080
someone

422
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,360
to escort her.

423
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,680
Xiu must be escorted to her home safely.

424
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,120
Yes, sir.

425
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,120
The army has issued pensions for her.

426
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,920
Hope it will help Zhang Fei’s families.

427
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,920
Let’s not talk about that.

428
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,200
The order from the division headquarter has been received.

429
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,680
You

430
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,520
go to Command Academy,

431
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,160
and will study in the intermediate class of commanders.

432
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,960
Don’t come back to the Ninth Company

433
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,520
after graduation.

434
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,400
Go to the Third Battalion

435
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,840
as the battalion commander.

436
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,040
There’re few soldiers in the regiment

437
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,320
who can be promoted from company commander to battalion commander.

438
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,840
You are one of the few soldiers.

439
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,920
Colonel has put in a lot of efforts this time

440
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,640
and promoted you jumping the ranks,

441
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,800
considering your contributions

442
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,600
for all these years,

443
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,120
in case there will be no such changes for you in the future.

444
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,800
Thanks, Colonel!

445
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,910
[We all come from different areas,]

446
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:56,260

All of you!

448
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,120
Salute to the hero!

449
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,800
Salute!

450
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:13,180
[Hongxing Hotel]

451
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,240
What’s wrong?

452
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,880
Close the door.

453
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,520
This is not something

454
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,960
that can be kept as a secret.

455
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,880
It will be found out whatsoever.

456
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,600
You and Gu Yiye,

457
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,720
one of you has to stay here,

458
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,360
instead of going to the military academy.

459
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:39,880
Why?

460
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,760
Originally, our company

461
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,200
has four quotas for the academy.

462
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,800
We thought that we could use all the quotas.

463
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,680
But the other companies did not accept that.

464
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,840
They reported to the superior

465
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,960
and said that we have less soldiers in the company

466
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,640
thus the quota of going to the military academy is too much.

467
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,120
After consideration, the battalion

468
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,120
removed

469
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,520
one of the quotas,

470
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,040
which means that

471
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,800
you and Gu Yiye

472
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,200
can share one quota only.

473
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,240
Commander,

474
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,760
the reason you told me about this here

475
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,600
is me staying here

476
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,320
and Gu Yiye going to the academy, right?

477
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,920
This is such a disaster.

478
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,480
But the battalion has to make the decision, based on the orders of the regiment.

479
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,840
Therefore, the battalion decided that

480
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,560
we have to

481
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,400
give up the quota.

482
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,920
Have to? How come it’s not Gu Yiye who has to do it?

483
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,680
I won’t.

484
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,600
Why do I have to give up everything for him?

485
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,760
I couldn’t send the bone ashes of our sergeant home.

486
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,000
I couldn’t go to the military academy.

487
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,240
Why are you always

488
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,200
show partiality to Gu Yiye?

489
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,880
Don’t you always say that I’m uneducated?

490
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,680
Now I have the chance to study,

491
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,880
and be educated.

492
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,960
Why would I give up to somebody who are more educated than me?

493
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:37,960
Why?

494
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,280
Isn’t Gu Yiye escorting Xiu now?

495
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,160
Do you have the heart to take up his quota

496
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,480
while he’s outside of the army?

497
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,480
Then do you have the heart to do this to me?

498
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,280
We do have less soldiers in our company.

499
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,640
Why’s that?

500
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,200
That’s because most of our comrades are martyrs.

501
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,880
What are their qualifications to take up our quota?

502
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,840
No, Gao Liang.

503
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,440
Commander, you don’t have to bother.

504
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,280
Okay.

505
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,480
I’ll fight for my own quota.

506
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,400
I will get my quota even that I have to beg for it.

507
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,840
I must go to the academy.

508
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,160
Don’t you dare to stop me.

509
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,600

512
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,760
I remember that

513
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,520
the moment I laid my eyes on her,

514
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,840
all I was thinking was that

515
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,320
who this girl was.

516
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,320
Such a pretty girl.

517
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,960
She said,

518
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,800
“Uniform.”

519
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,280
“That’s great.”

520
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,680
“I admire People's Liberation Army.”

521
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,840
Zhang Fei, you go fight your battles.

522
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,800
Don’t worry about your families.

523
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,520
I’ll take care of our mom.

Company Commander,

533
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,400
I know

534
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,360
you want Gu Yiye to study.

535
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,320
I’m not going to lie,

536
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,840
when the Battalion asked for my opinion,

537
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,360
I took into account the state of Gu Yiye

538
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,560
after his return,

539
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,320
I voted for him.

540
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,040
And

541
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,560
Gu Yiye is suitable for studying.

542
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,600
After my brother died,

543
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,520
I dropped out of junior high school.

544
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,400
Do you know the ranking of my graduation exam?

545
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,760
The last one?

546
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,320
It’s the first, but not last.

547
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,840
I’m the first in the village.

548
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,240
At that time, my class teacher, and the principal

549
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,400
wanted me to stay in school.

550
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,360
They thought I was a good student.

551
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,160
But there is no way.

552
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,320
I have no home.

553
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,280
I have to live first.

554
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,360
Therefore, it is not that I do not like studying,

555
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,920
I do not have a chance to study.

556
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,480
Later,

557
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,960
I joined the Army.

558
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,800
I felt that I had a chance

559
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,240
and had the conditions.

560
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,520
I hid in the quilt to read

561
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,880
and took notes every day.

562
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,800
When I went to work as a public servant for Division Commander,

563
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,040
I took his books to read.

564
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,120
Sometimes I couldn’t finish it,

565
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,120
so, I tore it down

566
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,560
and brought it back to read.

567
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,480
Later, Division Commander discovered it

568
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,720
and punished me for it.

569
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,320
He lost his temper with me.

570
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,720
I don’t want to disappoint Division Commander,

571
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,240
and I don’t want Jiang Nanzheng to think that

572
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,320
it’s embarrassing to know a rough guy like me.

573
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,440
I also worry that when I talk to the educated soldiers,

574
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,200
they don’t want to talk to me.

575
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,680
I also hope that one day

576
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,800
I can wear a big red flower

577
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,400
and stand on the podium,

578
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,880
looking at Jiang Nanzheng

579
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,080
and all of you.

580
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,880
There is another reason

581
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,560
why I try to educate myself

582
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,200
and study hard.

583
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,760
Because I love the army.

584
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,280
I want to stay in the army for the rest of my life,

585
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,200
the army is like my home.

586
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,360
Every one of my comrades

587
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,080
is like a family member to me.

588
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I have thought about it.

589
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,080
Only when I go to the military academy

590
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,320
and get promoted to a cadre

591
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,400
can I have a chance to stay in the army for life.

592
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,520
Otherwise, a few years later,

593
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,760
when I get out of the Army,

594
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,760
where do you think I can go?

595
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,560
I don’t think

596
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,560
you should deny me

597
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,080
a chance to go to school.

598
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:44,880
Gao Liang,

599
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,320
to be honest,

600
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,280
I just learned today that you think this way.

601
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,600
I’m sorry for you.

602
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,160
I didn’t pay enough attention to you.

603
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,080
Don’t worry.

604
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,040
I will go to see Colonel tomorrow.

605
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,720
If not, I’ll go to see Division Commander.

606
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,120
I will fight with them to the end.

607
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,080
In any case,

608
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,720
I will help you keep this place.

609
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,200
Let’s call it a day.

610
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,480
Get to bed early.

611
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,200
Company Commander,

612
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,720
thank you.

613
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,400
The Regiment has made a decision.

614
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,400
You know

615
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,120
the temper of Division Commander.

616
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,760
There’s no way he’d bend the rules for something like that.

617
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,280
I’ve thought about it.

618
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,360
I give up.

619
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,480
Give Gu Yiye this opportunity.

620
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,240
What did you say?

621
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,760
Whether I read or not,

622
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,240
that’s my business alone.

623
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,800
Gu Yiye goes to school,

624
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,680
it’s a two-person thing.

625
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,200
Let him go.

626
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,920
What do you mean?

627
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,840
Nothing.

628
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,190
Report to Company Commander,

629
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,400
I’m off to bed now.

630
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,630
Gao,

631
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,600
why do you always give yourself up?

632
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,720
Why?

00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:36,960
What’s up?

636
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,640
Zhang Fei took me to see the movie Liu Sanjie.

637
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,200
Did he?

638
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,440
Halfway through the movie that day, the power went out.

639
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,200
On the way home, we were always guessing

640
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,400
whether Liu Sanjie and Brother Niu

641
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,800
were together.

I don’t know what the result will be.

644
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,240
I guess brother Niu likes Liu Sanjie so much

645
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,760
that they must have become a family in the end.

646
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,240
The folk songs in the movie are wonderful.

648
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,640

00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,840
we came to see the movie.

652
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,000
It’s Liu Sanjie.

653
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,360
It’s the one we watched halfway through last time.

654
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,200
Did you hear the folk song?

655
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,880

Isn’t this

659
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,240
an urn for dead people?

660
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,000
I was right.

661
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,520
How can we watch the movie

662
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,480
when you bring such unlucky things

663
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,720
into the cinema

Well, PLA.

The PLA can't do this either.

Well,

698
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,040
I shouldn’t have hit you.

699
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,320
But you can’t do this to him either.

700
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,200
He was a brother from your hometown,

701
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,200
a comrade of mine.

702
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,320
He was a hero

703
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,200
who died defending his country on the battlefield.

704
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,320
He should have been sitting here

705
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,480
watching the movie, just like you.

706
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,800
Because he promised his wife that

707
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,240
he would bring her to see this movie.

708
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,720
But he died on the frontline

709
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,480
in order to let you sit here

710
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,000
and watch the movie in peace.

711
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,920
He can’t come,

712
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,000
he can only in this way,

713
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,240
in his hometown,

714
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,000
among his relatives,

715
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,360
with his wife,

716
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,800
sit quietly for a while.

717
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,200
Do not make a sound,

718
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,320
just sit quietly for a while.

719
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,600
Can’t this work?

720
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,360
How could you do this to him?

721
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,520
Sorry, Comrade PLA.

722
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,080
We remember the war a few years ago,

723
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,800
but we don’t remember much after that.

724
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,000
If it weren’t for the New Year greetings at the Spring Festival gala,

725
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:02,960
if it weren’t for being here today,

726
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,080
seeing you

727
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,640
and your comrade,

728
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,440
we really forgot that

729
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,400
the country is still at war.

730
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:10,800
Sorry.

731
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,640
Sorry, comrade.

732
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,400
My comrade won’t blame you.

733
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,240
Our sacrifice,

734
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,720
we hope you will forget it.

735
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,800
Only when there is true peace

736
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,320
can there be forgetting.

737
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,280
I didn’t do the right thing today.

738
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,520
I hit people,

739
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,240
and I accept the punishment.

740
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,240
I know you won’t do this.

741
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,520
I’ll do it myself.

742
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,240
Comrade PLA, I’m sorry.

743
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,200
It’s my fault.

744
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,640
I don’t know what’s going on.

745
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,920
What are you doing?

746
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:56,840
Comrade.

747
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,840
The hero,

748
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,480
what’s his name?

749
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,400
Whose child is he?

750
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,560
He is my Platoon Leader.

751
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,160
His name is Zhang Fei.

752
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,360
Come on.

753
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,800
