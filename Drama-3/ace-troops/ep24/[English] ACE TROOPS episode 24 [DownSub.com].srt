[Episode 24]

4
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,960
Why didn't you say anything to me?

5
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,880
Recently, I wrote letters to you

6
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,600
and called you,

7
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,759
but you made no response.

8
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:41,960
Gu Yiye.

9
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,479
Do you want to break up with me?

10
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,759
Gao Liang, your kick's

11
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:49,520
amazing!

12
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,520
- If you were not there, we wouldn't win.
- Awesome!

13
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,280
Of course you wouldn't win.

14
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,000
Do you know how amazing I am now?

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,039
- Gao Liang. Gao Liang.
- Do you know?

16
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,240
Hurry up. Let's...

17
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,039
Sergeant Han.

18
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,720
You know what?

19
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,280
Thanks to your cheer of encouragement,

20
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,200
we won the game.

21
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,600
We almost lost.
We only scored one more goal than them.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,040
You're amazing.

23
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,200
I didn't even shout.

24
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,160
Although you didn't shout,
I felt like I heard it.

25
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,360
If you shouted, I would get very excited.

26
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,120
You know what?

27
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,750
When I was in the new recruit company,

28
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,080
I could always hear your cheers.

29
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,200
Your cheers encouraged me.

30
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,360
Why are you so funny?

31
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,720
No kidding. I'm serious.

32
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,400
There are a lot of male soldiers

33
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,920
in the Communication Academy, right?

34
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:21,840
Yep.

35
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,520
Among all the female soldiers,

36
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,720
you're the most beautiful girl, right?

37
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,320
Just kidding.

38
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,880
What do you mean?

39
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,560
I've written a letter to you.

40
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,520
Have you received it?

41
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,800
What letter?

42
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,680
Gao Liang!

43
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,440
The unit leader wants to see you.

44
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,680
OK. I'll be right there.

45
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,960
- I...
- I gotta go.

46
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:42,920
It's going to rain.

47
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,200
Take my coat.

48
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,640
I gotta go. Bye.

49
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,000
Well...

50
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,400
Nanzheng.

51
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,440
Have you ever thought about a question?

52
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,200
What is it?

53
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,440
Do you think we are a good match?

54
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,040
What do you mean?

55
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,240
Sit down.

56
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,280
No.

57
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,880
I feel nervous when you stand here.

58
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,760
I said no.

59
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:15,920
I have a question for you.

60
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,840
We were under strict control

61
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,600
when we were in the company,

62
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,640
but

63
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,280
you were always on my mind.

64
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,440
Strict discipline was imposed on us,

65
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,600
but it couldn't prevent

66
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,079
our feelings for each other.

67
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,040
Now we're students of the military academy.

68
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,880
We're allowed to be in a relationship.

69
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,800
Why have you been avoiding me?

70
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,280
You shouldn't have asked me this question.

71
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,160
What's wrong with you?

72
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,000
Did you

73
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,240
fall in love with someone else?

74
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,480
I don't want to keep guessing.

75
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,000
Then stop guessing.

76
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,640
Nanzheng,

77
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,120
I wanna break up with you.

78
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,000
Why?

79
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,480
Gu Yiye,
look into my eyes and answer my question.

80
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,880
Why don't you look into my eyes?

81
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:22,800
Because...

82
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,440
Because you're the division commander's daughter.

83
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,920
I can't accept it.

84
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,320
Liar!

85
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,040
I don't think it's the reason.

86
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,440
Do you think I'm a fool?

87
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,960
Did you

88
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,720
get into trouble?

89
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,320
I got it.

90
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,920
You still

91
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,920
can't forget about that battle, right?

92
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,000
It's okay. I'll wait for you.

93
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,320
Or

94
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,000
do you think...

95
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,400
Do you think I'm not good enough?

96
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:00,800
No.

97
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,800
I've already made up my mind.

98
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,360
I said I disagree!

99
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,200
You know how much I like you.

100
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,120
You know how important you are to me.

101
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,800
Why would you treat me like that?

102
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,560
What is our previous relationship

103
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,640
to you?

104
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,040
Tell me, Gu Yiye!

105
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:35,730
♫ Yearning for me, looking at me. ♫

106
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:43,050
♫ Time turns into flowers,
like you, like me. ♫

107
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,800
Jiang Nanzheng.

108
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,360
What happened?

109
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
He hurt you, right?

110
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,040
Let's take revenge on him. Come on.

111
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,960
Let her go!

112
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,040
Mule Gu.

113
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,200
Will you feel uncomfortable

114
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,320
if you don't hurt Jiang Nanzheng?

115
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,680
You're happy to see her crying, right?

116
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,000
Are you really a man?

117
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,360
I'm not happy.
I'd rather die than live this way.

118
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,120
Then commit suicide. Don't hurt her.

119
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,960
I broke up with Jiang Nanzheng.

120
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,320
I don't care.

121
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,760
Anyway, you don't understand.

122
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,040
I don't understand?

123
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,400
I can't understand you.

124
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,120
It's not true that you can't understand me.

125
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,600
It's just that you can never see it.

126
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,920
I don't want to see anything.

127
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,680
I don't want to see anything!

128
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,720
Why do you look at me this way?
Did anything happen?

129
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,760
What happened?

130
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,680
Say something.

131
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,000
Because of a child.

132
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,320
Which child?

133
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:07,760
Stop guessing.

134
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,200
I'm asking you who the child is!

135
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,320
The child
of Xiu and Platoon Leader Zhang Fei!

136
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,760
Zhang Fei has a child, huh?

137
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,160
He's 4 months old.

138
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,600
He likes me so much.

139
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,720
Zhang Fei didn't know he has a child, did he?

140
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,400
I decided to raise the child

141
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,640
for our platoon leader.

142
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,120
Who do you think you are?

143
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,800
And then?

144
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,400
Both Xiu and the child need me.

145
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,760
I've already made up my mind, Gao Liang.

146
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,400
I chose Xiu

147
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,040
instead of Jiang Nanzheng.

148
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,440
I don't know if I should beat you.

149
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,570
You...

150
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,080
Do you feel sorry for Jiang Nanzheng?

151
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,520
Do you feel sorry for Xiu?

152
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,040
Do you feel sorry for yourself?

153
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,840
Listen!

154
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,840
Only in this way, can it be fair!

155
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,960
You hurt Jiang Nanzheng.

156
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,240
Where's the fairness?

157
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,840
You want to talk about the fairness with me, right?

158
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,400
You left Jiang Nanzheng and decided
to marry Xiu.

159
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,040
Is it fair to Jiang Nanzheng?

160
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,560
Is it fair to Xiu?

161
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,320
What about you?

162
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,200
Don’t you love her anymore?

163
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,549
Are you going to give up?

164
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,400
She loves you

165
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:38,640
instead of me.

166
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,200
Listen.

167
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,880
Xiu needs me.

168
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,240
Jiang Nanzheng also needs you.

169
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,200
That's different.

170
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,560
Jiang Nanzheng can still make choices

171
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,320
but Xiu can't.

172
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,720
More important, the child needs me.

173
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,120
That's what you think.

174
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,560
Will Xiu accept?

175
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,840
I'll try.

176
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,440
I'll try to make her accept.

177
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,440
Stop it!

178
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,480
Gu Yiye, listen.

179
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,880
If you do that,

180
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,840
two people's life will be ruined.

181
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,320
Look at the school where we stay every day.

182
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,760
We stay at such a beautiful school.

183
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,840
Every day we think about

184
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,240
how to achieve our ambitions,

185
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,960
how to make our life

186
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,880
better

187
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,800
and how to improve our relationship.

188
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,040
Do you know where Xiu is?

189
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,680
Xiu is in the mountain.

190
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,040
She lives in the rural area.

191
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,120
Every day she thinks about
how to earn a living,

192
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,400
how to support the elder

193
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,680
and how to raise the child!

194
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,720
Enough!

195
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,240
Gao Liang.

196
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,720
Sergeant...

197
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,080
Sergeant died on my back.

198
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,600
I have to carry him.

199
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,480
That's my fate.

200
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,560
I don't have to worry
because Nanzheng has you on her side.

201
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,920
How could you organize others' life?

202
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,840
Who do you think you are?

203
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,000
I did organize your life. So what?

204
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,760
Take care of Jiang Nanzheng.

205
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,680
Otherwise, I'll kill you.

206
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,120
That day,

207
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,720
Gu Yiye told me

208
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,320
the last words of Platoon Leader Zhang Fei.

209
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,800
When our platoon leader died,

210
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,120
the rest life of Gu Yiye was organized.

211
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:55,380
[Army Academy of People's Liberation Army]

212
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,140
One, two, three, four.

213
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,420
[Tutors]

214
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,680
I wanna make a call.

215
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:10,880
Hello.

216
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,720
Please put me through to
Jiang Nanzheng of the Sixth Squad.

217
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,880
Where are you from?

218
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,840
Infantry college.

219
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,040
She's not available. She said

220
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,480
male soldiers of
the infantry college are all jerks.

221
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,720
She's never available for them.

222
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,160
Well, you...

223
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,050
Hello?

224
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,480
Hello.

225
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,120
Please get me through
to Han Chunyu of the Third Troop.

226
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,440
I didn't expect that it's the reason.

227
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,760
I have the greatest respect for Gu Yiye.

228
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,360
He plucked up the courage

229
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,880
to make that choice.

230
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,840
A lot of people can make promises

231
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,400
but few of them

232
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,360
can keep their promises.

233
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,960
Nanzheng didn't choose the wrong mate.

234
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,480
But

235
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,080
why don't you tell Nanzheng

236
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,360
the real reason?

237
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,160
We think hatred is better than

238
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,240
sorrow.

239
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,320
Do you agree?

240
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,400
That's what men think.

241
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,440
Actually, it's still painful.

242
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,160
It's he. He.

243
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,520
Instead of men.

244
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,680
Gu Yiye is a jerk.

245
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,080
But you and Gu Yiye

246
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,040
conspired together.

247
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,640
Fine. We conspired together.

248
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,480
Don't tell Nanzheng about it.

249
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,840
You have to keep it secret.

250
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,320
Since you told me,

251
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,720
why do you want me to keep it secret?

252
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,760
You're Nanzheng's confidante

253
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,400
and my good friend, right?

254
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,720
Only you can comfort her.

255
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,720
She'll only listen to you.

256
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,720
OK.

257
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,600
I'll comfort her.

258
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,560
Your coat.

259
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:51,960
Take it back.

260
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,520
You washed it for me, huh?

261
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,920
Well, I'm going to return to the army soon.

262
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,000
I want to talk with you

263
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:02,720
about us.

264
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:03,960
Us?

265
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,400
What's wrong?

266
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,280
You... Sit down first.

267
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,520
Sit down.

268
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,400
What's wrong? Why do you want me to sit down?

269
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,840
Tell me.

270
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,280
Well, actually...

271
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,880
Actually, to me,

272
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,440
you're no longer

273
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,440
just a friend

274
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,120
or someone from the same city as me.

275
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,920
Do you remember the time when you were in
the new recruit company?

276
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,160
When you took me away from the river,

277
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,080
you became different to me.

278
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I already

279
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,840
told you that in the letter.

280
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,520
Which letter?

281
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,440
I haven’t received any letters.

282
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:53,760
Forget it.

283
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,480
Maybe it went missing halfway.

284
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,880
Anyway, that's not important anymore.

285
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,640
Actually,
I've been in a pickle for a long time.

286
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,440
I...

287
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,360
I've asked myself again and again.

288
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,280
Why would I have a crush

289
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,560
on a new recruit

290
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,720
who's younger than me?

291
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,080
But after I convinced myself,

292
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,080
my feelings for you became stronger.

293
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,400
I couldn't resist.

294
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,840
It's inevitable that we have
to face ourselves.

295
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,760
Am I right?

296
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,520
Yes, you're right.

297
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,280
I like you.

298
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,320
What about you?

299
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,560
I...

300
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,800
Well,

301
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,160
Sergeant Han,

302
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,400
I think...

303
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,320
I think...

304
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,720
To be honest,

305
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,720
I don't think we're a good match.

306
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,280
Why?

307
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,240
Why?

308
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,280
Every day I...

309
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,320
Well, I like a lot of people.

310
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,200
There are so many female soldiers.

311
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,560
I like every of them.

312
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,200
If I keep my mind

313
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,600
on all of them,

314
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,880
I'll be exhausted.

315
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,280
So many girls?

316
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,760
I think you only have a crush on Nanzheng.

317
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,240
Nanzheng...

318
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,120
Did I guess right?

319
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,680
Yes.

320
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,360
Actually...

321
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,360
I was touched by Gu Yiye's choice.

322
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,760
I think

323
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,760
we all need courage.

324
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,480
I always know

325
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,880
your feelings for Nanzheng.

326
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,720
However,
because of you three's relationship,

327
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,320
I saw what you did for Nanzheng.

328
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,720
So

329
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm concerned about you.

330
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,200
Anyway, that's all in the past.

331
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,920
Go to visit Nanzheng.

332
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,400
I think she needs you now.

333
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,040
It's a chance for you.

334
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,800
I don't need this chance.

335
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,560
Ask her out
when she just broke up with her boyfriend.

336
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,360
I will never do anything like that.

337
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,600
I don't want to humiliate myself.

338
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,880
Brat.

339
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,640
Both of
the process and the result are important.

340
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,960
You're right.

341
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,560
Sergeant Han.

342
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,160
Thank you for treating me as your friend

343
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,200
and

344
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,320
being honest with me.

345
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,680
Therefore,

346
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,800
I want to be honest with you, too.

347
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,680
I'm sorry.

348
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,320
I really

349
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,520
can't accept it.

350
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,800
Gao Liang.

351
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,520
You're waiting for Nanzheng

352
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,680
but I'm waiting for you.

353
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,920
Don't wait for me.

354
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,040
We can never be together.

355
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,310
Sergeant Han,

356
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,920
tell Jiang Nanzheng

357
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,240
that

358
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,800
from tomorrow onward,

359
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,589
I'll officially chase her.

360
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:14,880
I gotta go.

361
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,720
Take care, Sergeant Han.

362
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,829
Sorry, Sergeant Han.

363
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,829
I dare not turn around.

364
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,920
I know you're upset.

365
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,400
I really want to go back, comfort you

366
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,160
and tell some jokes.

367
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,360
I want you to laugh

368
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,760
instead of crying.

369
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,000
Besides Nanzheng and my brother,

370
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,640
you're the closest person to me.

371
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,440
But this time,

372
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,800
I dare not make you have illusions
or feel hopeful.

373
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,880
I'm afraid that you'll be more upset

374
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,040
so I'd rather pretend to be a bad guy.

375
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,880
I really don't want you to be sad.

376
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,080
I want to call you sister.

377
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,520
Sorry, Sister Chunyu.

378
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,700
[6 months later...]

379
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:25,540
[Create a new situation in
the revolution and modernization of the army]

380
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,360
Comrade.

381
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,760
Come on. Let me help you carry the suitcase.

382
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,280
Give it to me.

383
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,040
Come on. Give it to me.

384
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,480
You broke up with Gu Yiye.

385
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,680
He's like the United States.

386
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,840
It's right for you to break up with him.

387
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,320
But I'm like Cuba. You shouldn't have

388
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,120
avoided me.

389
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,400
We have a strategic alliance.

390
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,600
Why can I see you everywhere?

391
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,760
Our troop came here for training.

392
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,320
It's just a coincidence.

393
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,440
You know what?

394
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,280
It's fate that brought us together.

395
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,800
You can never avoid it.

396
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,200
Really?

397
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,240
Sergeant Han is also here.

398
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,960
Did you see her?

399
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,080
Why do you seem to be confused?

400
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,200
Are you pretending to be confused?

401
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,080
I don't know why you are so lucky

402
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,960
to have our wonderful sergeant's admiration.

403
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,760
You really changed.

404
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,960
Now you care about others.

405
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,200
Really?

406
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,920
Left, right, left.

407
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,080
Both of them lost some weight.

408
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,480
That means they didn't slack off.

409
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,800
Sergeant, are you okay?

410
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,880
I'm good.

411
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,840
All right. Go back now.

412
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,200
OK.

413
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,040
Go back for training.

414
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,120
Bye-bye.

415
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:38,960
Chunyu.

416
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,960
Deputy Company Commander Xia.

417
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,480
I'm so happy to meet you.

418
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,120
Why are you in the division?

419
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,000
My vacation just began.

420
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,160
You didn't go home, huh?

421
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,800
I missed the army so I came back.

422
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,120
What are you doing here?

423
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,400
We're teaching soldiers in the division.

424
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,960
A member got injured during the training.

425
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,640
He was hospitalized. I'm going to visit him.

426
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,000
Why didn't you reply to my letter?

427
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,600
I don't know how to reply.

428
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,200
I think

429
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,480
I've already made it clear.

430
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,920
You don't have a boyfriend.

431
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,240
Why did you give that reason
for refusing to be my girlfriend?

432
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,680
Don't look at me this way.

433
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,040
No one told me anything.

434
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,520
Your eyes

435
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,080
betrayed you.

436
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,800
Actually, you're good.

437
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,360
Many of our female soldiers

438
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,800
have a crush on you.

439
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,000
I believe you.

440
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,640
Are you so confident?

441
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,280
Of course.

442
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,320
Otherwise, I wouldn't chase you.

443
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,320
Honestly,

444
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,880
I had to pluck up the courage

445
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,560
to chase you.

446
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,560
Chunyu.

447
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,280
I have to

448
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,640
tell you something.

449
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,720
I know

450
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,440
it may make you

451
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,640
misunderstand me,

452
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,400
but if I don't make it clear,

453
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,440
I'll never forgive myself.

454
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,600
Tell me.

455
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,400
You wrote a letter to Gao Liang.

456
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,400
But I thought it was for me.

457
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,400
I opened it by accident.

458
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,200
When I took the letters
for me and him on that day,

459
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,320
I had no time to give him his letter.

460
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,720
There was an emergency muster.

461
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,240
And when we finished the training at night,

462
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,640
we were exhausted.

463
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,440
And then?

464
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,600
Then

465
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,920
I'd like to admit

466
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,120
I read the whole letter

467
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,840
due to the curiosity and jealousy.

468
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,360
Chunyu.

469
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,720
I always...

470
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,680
I always want to give it to you.

471
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,240
Luckily, I met you today.

472
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,320
Let me return it to you.

473
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,720
Why do you want to return it to me?

474
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,400
I wrote it to Gao Liang.

475
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,160
Because if I give it to Gao Liang,

476
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,640
it's likely that he'll misunderstand me.

477
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,840
But if I return it to you,

478
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:55,840
you won't misunderstand me

479
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,920
because you're an upright person.

480
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,760
You never misunderstand anything.

481
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,160
That's the reason why I trust you so much

482
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,560
and I confessed at the risk of

483
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,200
being refused and despised.

484
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,600
Soldier is a profession
that has a long history.

485
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,120
After your compatriot dies,

486
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,160
take care of his wife and children.

487
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,160
People who lived thousands of
years ago already did that.

488
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,960
It's pretty common all over the world.

489
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,040
To a large extent, classical armies

490
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,000
depend on the ancient tacit agreement

491
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,520
and brotherhood.

492
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,240
It's about the kindness

493
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,760
and responsibility.

494
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,600
Since Xiu and her child live a poor life,

495
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,520
you want to sacrifice the rest of your life.

496
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,960
What is the People's Army?

497
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,480
Why you?

498
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,280
When the sky falls,

499
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,240
you’re the tall one.

500
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,440
This is the mission that only you can accomplish.

the burden of responsibility fell on my shoulders.

530
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,960
Your companionship and inspiration along this journey

531
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,520
will be buried deep in my heart.

00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,200
I’m sorry.

534
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,240
I know what I’ve done here,

00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,400
with you.

536
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,200

Owe me for life.

549
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,760
Then I will never forgive myself.

550
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,520
Yiye,

551
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,080
I will look for the answer

552
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,800
until I find it.

553
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,880
There you go, daughter.

554
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:31,920
Eat.

555
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,160
Why don’t you eat?

556
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,920
I told you I don’t want to eat.

557
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,040
Look at you.

558
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,160
No matter how sad you are,

559
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,120
it is a bowl of rice noodles.

560
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,440
You can hate the guy,

561
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,640
but you don’t have to hate the rice noodles.

562
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,440
What did Gao Liang say to you?

563
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,000
Do I need Gao Liang to tell me?

564
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,760
It’s written all over your face.

565
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,880
The thinner you are, the more you look like your mom.

566
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,160
Your mom

567
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,680
was different from you.

568
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,320
She hated me and ignored me.

569
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,720
But she ate meat

570
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,560
and rice noodles as usual.

571
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,920
It takes physical strength to hate a person.

572
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,200
Only when you have eaten enough can you hate a person.

573
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,360
What do you say, daughter?

574
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,320
I don’t hate anyone.

575
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,000
Then I’m going to criticize you.

576
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,880
Why not?

577
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,440
If you had told me earlier,

578
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,800
I would have kicked his ass.

579
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,520
There’s no chance for him to go to the military academy

580
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,360
and be an elite. It's all bullshit.

581
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,400
I’ll send him to the farm to feed the pigs.

582
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,600
What are you doing?

583
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,720
You investigated me.

584
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,160
Otherwise, how do you know

585
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,240
so much about me?

586
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:52,880
I’m telling you,

587
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,000
this is my personal business,

588
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,160
and I can handle it,

589
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,320
without your interference, Division Commander.

590
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,640
Interference?

591
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,280
Well, sit down.

592
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,280
Did I intervene?

593
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,760
That’s a serious crime for me.

594
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,920
Did I interfere with you?

595
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,120
But when you fall in love with someone in the future,

596
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,520
I have to intervene.

597
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,600
I don’t believe it.

598
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,360
Who dares to bully my daughter?

599
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,280
Who dares to bully me? It’s you.

600
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,360
What did I do to you?

601
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,880
Do you know why he broke up with me?

602
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,400
Why?

603
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,640
Because I’m your daughter.

604
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,840
He doesn’t want to be the son-in-law of a Division Commander.

605
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,480
Well, this guy

606
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,680
has moral integrity. I like him.

607
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,200
Comrade Zheng Yuan.

608
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,600
Don’t you have your own principles?

609
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,720
You said you wanted him to feed the pigs,

610
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,240
and now you like him.

611
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,240
Do you love your daughter

612
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,480
or admire your soldier?

613
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,440
My beloved daughter, you know nothing.

614
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,640
A man

615
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,200
must know self-respect,

616
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,000
self-confidence.

617
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,000
That’s not self-respect and self-confidence.

618
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,320
That’s selfishness.

619
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,160
If you don’t tell me these bullshit reasons,

620
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,680
I won’t think about it.

621
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,520
After hearing what you said,

622
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,880
I think this guy must have something to suffer from,

623
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,400
or it doesn’t make sense.

624
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,320
You should understand him.

625
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,640
When your mom and I…

626
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,720
Dad, I don’t want to hear this.

627
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,040
Do you think I’d be happy

628
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,280
if you told me that?

629
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,600
Why can’t you learn

630
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,280
how to care about others?

631
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,120
You always feel that you are right

632
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,440
and impose your own ideas on others.

633
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,600
You’ve left everyone

634
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,160
around you scarred.

635
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,400
And

636
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,960
I won’t be like mom.

637
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,920
I won't live with hate.

638
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,720
Don’t worry about that.

639
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,720
You don’t have to defend yourself,

640
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,920
and you don’t have to tell me.

641
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,440
What a naughty daughter,

642
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,840
you really blocked me.

643
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,160
I have to knock down this wall.

644
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,320
I must tell you what happened in those days.

645
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:15,220
[Carry every red flag.]

646
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,940
♫ The south wind blows gently ♫

647
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,900
♫ Blows away the fog ♫

648
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:48,330
♫ Blowing me to you ♫

649
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:55,150
♫ The north wind comes quietly ♫

650
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,020
♫ It's plucking away the wheat ♫

651
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:03,660
♫ Let me find you ♫

652
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,360
Commander Gu.

653
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,480
Why are you willing to meet me today?

654
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:09,640
What’s up?

655
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,760
Cut it out. Have a seat.

656
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,480
Sit down and I’ll talk to you.

657
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,520
You’ll know when you read it.

658
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:27,150
♫ I’m willing to do everything about you ♫

659
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:37,170
♫ I’ll leave you the place in my hand ♫

660
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,320
Finished it?

661
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,440
The contents of these three letters are similar.

662
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,520
Xiu is rejecting me.

663
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,720
I’ve really thought of all kinds of ways,

664
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,960
but I can’t convince her.

665
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,840
I’m the one who gets the best

666
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,320
in the academy exams.

667
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,720
So why is it that when it comes to Xiu,

668
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,000
I feel like I’m never going to pass.

669
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,800
Those of you

670
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,680
who come from cadre families,

671
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,720
all of you

672
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,680
have learned a lot

673
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,240
and are full of knowledge,

674
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,120
how come you can’t understand the letter?

675
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,040
Shame on you.

676
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,000
Read it.

677
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,520
Why?

678
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,960
Just read.

679
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,200
Hello, Comrade Gu.

680
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,600
I’ve received the money you and Gao sent.

681
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,560
Thank you.

682
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,320
I’ll take the money.

683
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,680
But I don’t agree with the idea

684
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,920
you put forward.

685
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,440
I firmly disagree.

686
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,120
Fei boy won’t agree.

687
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,000
Don’t think like that again,

688
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,880
and don’t write any more letters.

689
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,200
Say hello to Gao.

690
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,720
Xiu.

691
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,480
Keep reading.

692
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,520
What do you want?

693
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,560
Do you want to solve the problem?

694
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,560
Read.

695
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,520
Gu,

696
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:24,620
[Xiu]

697
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,800
hello.

698
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,640
I’ve received the money you and Gao sent.

699
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,280
I can’t trouble you anymore.

700
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,680
Stop sending money.

701
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,480
Mom is in better health now.

702
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,760
She can hold the baby

703
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,800
to chase the chickens back to the nest.

704
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,000
The baby can crawl.

705
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,840
Don’t mention that again.

706
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,200
Like I said, I disagree.

707
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:40,960
You’ve trained hard.

708
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,320
You don’t have to write letters.

709
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,000
Say hello to Gao.

710
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,600
Xiu.

711
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,320
Well, next.

712
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,200
Your mom

713
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,520
is the only woman

714
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,640
I ever cared about in my life.

715
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,000
I owe her a lot.

716
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,000
Dad,

717
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,880
this is the first time

718
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,360
you’ve told me about mom.

719
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,670
Dad,

720
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,880
you are much older than before.

721
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,440
Nonsense.

722
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,230
I was in my twenties then,

723
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,630
and I was young

724
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,150
and handsome.

725
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,400
Dad,

726
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,880
you and mom

727
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,600
have a romantic story.

728
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:38,040
And I envy mom so much,

729
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,080
having a man like you to care about her and love her.

730
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,480
Mom doesn’t know how lucky she is.

731
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,040
Why didn’t you tell me before?

732
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,920
Would you listen to me when I told you?

733
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:53,880
Daughter,

734
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,840
I know you got two comrades on your side.

735
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,200
One is Gu Yiye, and the other one is Gao Liang.

736
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,880
They are all excellent.

737
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,160
But

738
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,200
they are two different

739
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,840
types of men.

740
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,160
Do you agree?

741
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,800
Gao Liang is enthusiastic and motivated,

742
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,120
brave and tenacious, exhausting all efforts.

743
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,280
Even the most critical Song Jianshe,

744
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,080
cannot say he is not good.

745
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,720
However, he only completed the life of an ordinary soldier.

746
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,280
For girls,

747
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,000
he is ordinary, down-to-earth, responsible,

748
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,280
and worthy of girls’ trust.

749
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,360
Gu Yiye, on the other hand,

750
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,680
is arrogant, confident, and unruly.

751
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,600
He will show superhuman courage

752
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,520
and strength in do or die,

753
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,640
and will not hesitate to burn himself and the people around him.

754
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,760
This is destructive to girls.

755
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,120
The girl who falls in love with him will be hard.

756
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,080
If Gao Liang fights all his life to become a hero,

757
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,560
then Gu Yiye is a legend.

758
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,160
But it’s too hard to be a legend.

759
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,680
Legends have the great risk of falling

760
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,920
and burning into ashes;

761
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,240
the risk of struggling through life

762
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,280
in the mire of mediocrity.

763
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,760
For ordinary people,

764
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,560
ordinary life is good.

765
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,600
But for people like Gu Yiye,

766
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,480
every minute and every second are a torment.

767
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,200
They will also vent their anger at the people

768
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,080
who love them because of the suffering every minute.

769
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,480
How do you know?

770
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,760
How could I not know?

771
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,880
I am the one

772
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,200
who is struggling in the mire of mediocrity.

773
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,280
I don’t want my daughter

774
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,120
to be such a worthless fuel

775
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,600
in that person’s life.

776
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,600
You mean,

777
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,440
mom is the worthless fuel, right?

778
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,960
Because your mom left me,

779
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,600
she lived up to her value.

780
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:07,720
Dad,

781
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,720
tell me that,

782
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,520
does someone like you

783
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,720
ever change?

784
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,120
I’d like to say yes.

785
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,920
But I can’t lie to you.

786
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,000
Come on.

787
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,240
Dad,

788
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,480
what happened to your hand?

789
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,240
It’s been a long time since I cooked.

790
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,800
Eat slowly and don’t choke, daughter.

791
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,400
Do you see the difference?

792
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,640
The content is the same,

793
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,240
they are all rejecting me.

794
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,480
Your stupid head. You’re killing me.

795
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,800
I’ll give you an analysis.

796
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:22,840
Three letters.

797
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,440
Do you see

798
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,560
what the names are?

799
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,600
Comrade Gu.

800
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,320
Gu.

801
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,000
Brother Yiye.

802
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,840
What does that mean?

803
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,600
That shows that her mind is changing.

804
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:37,840
Right?

805
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,840
Look at the content of the letter.

806
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,600
She has already started to talk to you about the family

807
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,080
and she’s going to send you the bacon.

808
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,680
What does this mean?

809
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,600
She misses you and cares about you.

810
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:50,680
And then what?

811
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,240
And then present yourself well.

812
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,040
I think the door is about to open.

813
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:57,960
No way.

814
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,080
What if Xiu says no to my face?

815
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,040
Forget about it and do what you have to do.

816
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,680
Yiye,

817
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,040
why are you getting so unsure of yourself?

818
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,280
Where is

819
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,160
your unruly attitude before?

820
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,560
I don’t know what happened.

821
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,200
When it comes to Xiu,

822
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,360
I feel nervous.

823
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,680
There you go.

824
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,480
You’re in character.

825
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,640
Cut it out.

826
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,720
Let me tell you something.

827
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,600
I think you know that

828
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,600
I

829
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,440
am quite popular

830
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,960
among the female soldiers in the Communication Academy.

831
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,000
They admire me.

832
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,040
So as far as this matter is concerned,

833
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,800
I’ll give you three secrets.

834
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,000
First,

835
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,240
insist on.

836
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,600
Second,

837
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,440
being shameless.

838
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,240
- Third…
- Come on.

839
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,840
I knew the third one.

840
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,800
Just like you,

841
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,720
insist on being shameless.  Is that right?

842
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,240
You seem to understand.

843
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,960
You know everything.

844
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,760
I can’t talk to you seriously.

845
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,560
Okay, fine.

846
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,920
Let me tell you something serious.

847
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,640
The root cause is that

848
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,640
those of you who came from cadre families

849
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,160
do not understand the sufferings of the world.

850
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,520
What does love

851
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,320
mean to Xiu?

852
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,640
She can’t even think about it.

853
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,080
What environment does Xiu live in every day?

854
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,560
All kinds of life pressure are on her.

855
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,480
She’s like

856
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,640
a drowning person.

857
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,840
What about you?

858
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,760
You’re the rope in the water.

859
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,440
Doesn’t she want to hold on to you?

860
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,640
That’s nonsense.

861
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,600
Xiu is not that kind of person.

862
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,440
Yeah, right.

863
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,080
I didn't say she was either.

864
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,480
Let me tell you,

865
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,560
what do you mean to Xiu

866
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:47,960
and the people in the village?

867
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,080
You are a PLA,

868
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,120
a Bodhisattva soldier

869
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,280
and a Chainbreaker

870
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,000
who can save Xiu from the hot water.

871
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,040
You

872
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,200
chose Xiu

873
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,280
because of your responsibility,

874
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,040
but that was only the beginning.

875
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,760
If you want to go on with Xiu

876
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,640
in the future,

877
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,400
you have to love her.

878
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,280
You have to let her feel the love

879
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,600
that she couldn’t even get from Zhang Fei.

880
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,520
That’s fair.

881
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,880
You should think about this matter carefully.

882
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,600
Love her. Can you do that?

883
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:25,800
Got it?

884
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,920
I will do my best.

885
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,560
I’m gonna make it happen.

886
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:34,960
Okay.

887
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,120
Then today’s lesson was not in vain.

888
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,400
Gao Liang.

889
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,240
Thank you.

890
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,840
You’re welcome.

891
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,880
Alright.

892
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,040
I have to go.

893
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:53,720
Wait.

894
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,600
What's wrong with you?

895
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,320
You stole all my knowledge,

896
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,320
and you just want to run away, huh?

897
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,280
Gao Liang.

898
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,160
Why didn’t I think

899
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,760
you knew so much about love?

900
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,880
I’m a late bloomer.

901
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,160
Jiang Weixing and Niu will be here soon.

902
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,000
Say hello to them for me.

903
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:26,900
[Carry every red flag.]

904
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,720
Don’t shine the flashlight on me.

905
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,920
Don’t shine the flashlight on me.

906
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,240
I’ll kick your ass.

907
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:30,960
There you go.

908
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,000
Well, the smell.

909
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:36,800
Are you ready?

910
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,840
Not bad.

911
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,440
Shouldn’t we sing a song before eating?

912
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,480
No singing, no eating.

913
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,400
Cut it out.

914
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,560
This is a small gathering. We’d better keep it low-key.

915
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,480
Don’t bring Song here.

916
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,080
Come on.

917
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:53,760
Did you bring the rules?

918
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,160
Rules.

919
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,480
Of course.

920
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,040
Come on.

921
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,440
Cheers.

922
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,480
To the Ninth Company.
