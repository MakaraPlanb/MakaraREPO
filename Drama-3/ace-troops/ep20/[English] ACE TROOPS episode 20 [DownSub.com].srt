00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,680
You are discharged, Gao.

5
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:40,600
Yeah.

6
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,960
I’ll report to the Company Commander first.

7
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,160
Company Commander,

8
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:54,960
I’m back.

9
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,600
Why did the hospital let you come back?

10
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,200
This’s nonsense!

11
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,560
A few days ago,

12
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,360
I used to pretend to be sleepwalking.

13
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,470
I pushed the door from ward to ward and entered.

14
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,880
They were all frightened.

15
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,760
I told the doctor that

16
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,440
I had a mental problem.

17
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,400
I have to hurry back to the Company

18
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,079
to see my comrades.

19
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,040
The doctor believed it.

20
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,079
I’m not lying to him,

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,240
I really want to go back to the Company.

22
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,440
You have to treat the wound even if you want to join the Company.

23
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,680
Okay, fine.

24
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,600
That’s it, then.

25
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,680
Don’t forget to go to the health clinic to change the dressing every day.

26
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,400
Don’t let the wound get infected.

27
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,280
Yes, Commander.

28
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,560
- Chief.
- Chief.

29
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,160
I’ve heard about you.

30
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,840
Twice wounded.

31
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,280
How’s the recovery going?

32
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,440
Report to the Chief,

33
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,600
all is well.

34
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,880
Fortunately, it is a perforating injury and not a blind tract wound.

35
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,000
You must check on schedule.

36
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,079
Don’t get infected, got it?

37
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,600
Don’t worry, it’s cured.

38
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,440
Let me show you.

39
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,360
I don’t want to see your wounds.

40
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,079
My heart will tremble when I see it.

41
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,800
You must get well,

42
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,760
don’t leave any problems behind.

43
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,200
By the time you can’t get married and have children,

44
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
I’ll convict you.

45
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,560
Yes, Chief.

46
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,079
Go ahead.

48
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,840
I have disciplined you in the past,

00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,280
the record stays and the opinion are written off.

50
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,079
It was a good fight.

51
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,200
That’s the kind of soldier I lead.

52
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,800
Get ready

53
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,360
and go back to the Regiment 700.

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,160
Go back to the Night Tiger Company?

55
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,920
Don’t you always want to go back to your previous company?

56
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,680
According to your performance this time,

57
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,120
your wish must be satisfied.

58
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,760
But you can’t go back to the Night Tiger Company.

59
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,120
The superior decided to send you to military school for a crash course.

60
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,560

62
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,269
I don’t care about the order,

63
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,000
that’s a matter for the cadre department.

64
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,720
I’m telling you in advance.

65
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,440
I’m here for nothing.

66
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,240
I had just come back and was upset.

67
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,040
I lied to the Political Commissar and said that

68
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,080
I had to see the officers and soldiers.

69
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,080
Political Commissar then believed it.

70
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,400
However,

71
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,400
it’s not a lie.

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,120
I visit my soldiers,

73
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,480
that’s not a lie.

74
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,480
Of course not.

75
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,840

He Bing?

86
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,080
Didn’t He Bing get pulled back?

87
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,440
The hospital operated on him

88
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,760
and failed to save him.

89
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,200
The operation was performed,

90
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,920
and he persisted for a week,

91
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,320
but he didn’t make it.

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,240
Why go through all this trouble?

93
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,960
There were only 27 people

94
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,360
who came back alive in our Company,

95
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,560
and 17 of them were lying in the hospital.

96
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,440
Can’t we make a list for the living

97
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,560
and hand over the rest of the guard bags

98
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,360
to the Battalion?

99
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,360
Even if it is handed over to the Battalion, the list must be made

100
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,000
and handed in only after it is cleaned up.

101
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,760
Do you think everything is that simple?

102
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,600

everyone sat in a daze.

110
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,880
I’m going to ask the Battalion for instructions,

111
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,040
and to see if we can

112
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,680
team up with the Ninth Company and the Third Company.

113
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,560
This way it will be livelier.

116
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,880
It’s a solution.

117
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,320
The issue of the formal organization will be considered in the Division.

118
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,360
Can you cook a few dishes in the evening?

119
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,159
I want to invite the soldiers to have a meal.

120
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,040
- Shall I prepare the wine?
- Yes.

121
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,920

You are all on the front line.

00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,240
this old villain,

157
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,520
he’s pretty good at it.

158
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,600
I, Gu Yiye, have never suffered a loss

159
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,920
in fighting with anyone.

160

But only to fight with you,

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,400
I have never taken advantage of it.

162
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,080

163
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,160
Hold him tight.

164

Don’t hit the recruits.

165
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,760
Come at me if you dare!

166
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,640

167

I found out that that’s what you like.

If you suffer losses,

169
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,040
you will retaliate anyway.

This time on the battlefield,

a lot of people in our Company

179

look down on you.

180
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,520
This quilt should be tidied up.

181
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,360
After a long time,

182
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,840
the internal affairs standard will naturally be improved.

183
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,400
Everyone says you are

Crawled desperately to the radio station,

188
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,680
and with your last breath,

189
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,400
sent out a distress signal.

190
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,200
We were ambushed.

191
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,880
Hongliu.

192
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,000
The Vice Sergeant.

193
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,200
Report to everyone,

194
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,800
my name is Zhao Hongliu.

195
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,200
As you said,

196
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,000
if comrades are in trouble,

197
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,920
you will bear it with us.

198
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,200
But I’m terrible.

199
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,000
Why am I so poor at everything?

200
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,960
I don’t want to hold the group back anymore.

201
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,880
On the way home,

202
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,720
you learned the news of the war,

203
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,040
took the train back

204
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,480
and caught up with the Company.

205
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,200
I am not as good as you in training.

206
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,040
But I’m also the People’s son,

207
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,680
with the blood of soldiers flowing in my body.

208
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,360
Even if I do the nastiest things,

209
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,680
I can’t be a deserter.

210
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,240
At the time of retreat,

211
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,840
you ignored your injuries.

212
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,040
Jiang Nanzheng sent me medicine,

213
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,480
which was tipped off by Hongliu.

214
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,040
Hongliu,

215
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,760
if God is kind enough

216
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,520
to let you come back alive,

217
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,920
I’d rather let you fool me ten more times.

218
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,360
Stand up.

219
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,880
Chief.

220
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,640
Niu Mancang.

221
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,240
He saved Gao Liang’s life.

222
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,680
You’ve worked hard, boy.

223
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,840
Thank you, Division Commander.

224
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,040
This is the bed of the Third Platoon Leader, Zhang Fei.

225
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,360
According to regulations,

226
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,840
he could have lived alone.

227
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,800
He is from the Ninth Squad.

228
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,840
But he insisted on moving back in with his brothers.

229
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,520
On the battlefield,

230
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,720
he died to cover his comrades

231
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,560
in the Squad.

232
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,920
You go out first.

233
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,160
I want to stay here for a while.

234
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,320
Yes, Chief.

235
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,760
Son,

236
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,680
I will stay with you.

237
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,600
Come on, fill up the wine.

238
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,280
Fill up the wine.

239
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,720
I know your feelings.

240
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,040
A company came back with less than 30 people.

241
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,960
Another half is lying in the hospital.

242
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,720
In the war history of Division 234,

243
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,760
it’s never been so tragic.

244
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,200
I can understand.

245
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,680
You don’t want to talk about it.

246
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,640
But I want to mention it.

247
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,640
Here, drink

248
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,760
this wine.

249
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,600
What are you watching them for?

250
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,160
I invite you today.

251
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,640
They’re here for company.

252
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,320
Drink.

253
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,109
Fill up the wine.

254
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,840
Today is my treat,

255
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,560
you have to enjoy this big meal.

256
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,680
There will be no such opportunity in the future.

257
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,080
Unless you become generals,

258
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,600
it’s my turn to enjoy the meal.

259
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,640
Come on.

260
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,520
Drink.

261
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,440
Why are you staring at him?

262
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,560
What’s wrong with crying?

263
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,320
Your Regiment sacrificed so many soldiers,

264
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,240
shouldn’t he cry?

265
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,120
Just cry.

266
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,800
Cry as much as you want.

267
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,240
I’m your boss.

268
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,080
Cry as much as you want.

269
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,120
A hero has tears.

270
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,640
No tears. That’s a stone.

271
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,820
[Never shed tears even for bloody sweat. Never be left behind even being peeled of the meat.]

272
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,240
Come on, let’s have a third toast.

273
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,080
Look at you guys,

274
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,640
I have no freedom at all.

275
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,840
Chen Dashan.

276
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,120
Yes.

277
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,160
You take some dishes. Go to that table.

278
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,760
Go ahead. Yes.

279
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,400
Eat as much as you like.

280
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,360
Drink as much as you like.

281
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,800
Come on.

282
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,720
I propose a toast to you.

283
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,400
Come on.

284
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,540
[Strive to be excellent officers and soldiers at the community-level.]

285
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,440
What’s going on?

286
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,520
Take care of the Chief.

287
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,040
Things are not right today.

288
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,680
How do I care? You’d better do it.

289
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,840
Don’t play dumb with me.

290
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,280
He listens to you.

291
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,480
Chief is right.

292
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,440
If you are human,

293
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,840
you will have tears.

294
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,160
No tears. That’s a stone.

295
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,040
It would be better if Chief cried with us.

296
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,200
It’s good if we all cry.

297
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,320
Don’t give me that.

298
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,360
You can’t teach a vet a lesson.

299
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,440
Okay, I see.

300
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,640
I’m going back.

301
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,760
Company Commander,

302
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,960
I want to take a leave of absence.

303
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:40,960
What’s up?

304
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,760
The wine,

305
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,360
I really can’t drink it.

306
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:53,580
[Strive to be excellent officers and soldiers at the community-level.]

307
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,840
I’ve got the list of credits

308
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,160
you asked for.

309
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,960
Why aren’t you in here?

310
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,520
Why are all the sacrificed brothers here?

311
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,480
Gu Yiye.

312
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,400
Selfless is right.

313
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,160
It is commendable

314
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,360
to give all the credits to the martyrs.

315
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,240
But this is not realistic.

316
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,280
Those who survived

317
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,040
are not without a chance to die.

318
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,040
They all narrowly escaped death

319
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,960
before they got their lives back.

320
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,000
What are they gonna think

321
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,520
when you did this?

322
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,160
Chief,

323
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,160
this is the list of credits of our Company.

324
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,480
I had Gu Yiye draft it for me.

325
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,760
I don’t care about your business.

326
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,960
Go back to dinner.

327
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,440
Chief,

328
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,880
Gu Yiye said he wanted to ask for leave.

329
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,320
He can’t drink this wine.

330
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,360
Why?

331
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,800
Chief,

332
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,600
I...

333
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,080
I’m going to deal with something with Gu Yiye,

334
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,000
can you invite the Colonel to have a drink with you?

335
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,040
Go back to dinner.

336
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,320
You go to work in half an hour.

337
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:10,960
Yes, Chief.

338
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,000
Have a seat, please.

339
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,320
Chief,

340
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,360
drink less.

341
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,360
Take care of your health and take the medicine.

342
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,520
Gu Yiye.

343
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,520
Yes, Chief.

344
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,120
Have a seat. Don’t be so nervous.

345
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,400
I just said that

346
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,240
you don’t want to mention things,

347
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,520
but I want to mention them.

348
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,480
Then I’ll start with you.

349
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,760
Gao Liang told me about you.

350
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,360
I won’t mention anything else,

351
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,280
just one thing.

352
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,440
Gao Liang.

353
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,580
[Live and die together]

354
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,680
I don’t know who wrote those five characters,

355
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,280
but they’re powerful.

356
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,520
People who have not experienced life and death

357
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,680
cannot write them.

358
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,800
Chief,

359
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,560
these five characters

360
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,280
were written by Gu Yiye.

361
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,040
We lost so many men in the Company,

362
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,120
these characters

363
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,240
are to tell the brothers,

364
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,800
we live and die together.

365
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,820
[Live and die together]

366
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,760
Gu Yiye,

367
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,120
you were ordered to rescue those lost comrades.

368
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,760
On the way, you met several times as many enemies as you.

369
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,720
The fighting was fierce.

370
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,640
You,

371
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,240
fought your way out of

372
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,160
the enemy’s encirclement,

373
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,040
brought back all your Company’s comrades,

374
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,840
other Company’s comrades,

375
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:56,060
[Live and die together]

376
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,120
and the wounded and sacrificed,

377
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,600
without leaving them behind.

378
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,800
Brought them all back.

379
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,560
Your Platoon Leader

380
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,280
died in the battle.

381
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,720
He was to rescue

382
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,480
13 comrades in the Third Company.

383
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,200
He didn’t know any of the 13 comrades,

384
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,880
but he gave his life

385
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,280
to save them

386
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,640
and to cover you.

387
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,200
And so are you.

388
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,680
You didn’t know any of these 13 people,

389
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,360
but you risked your life

390
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,080
for them.

391
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,040
And you, Niu Mancang.

392
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,000
Yes, Chief.

393
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,640
When Gao Liang rushed out

394
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,880
to attract the enemies’ attention,

395
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,440
you were in a relatively safe position.

396
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,080
You could have retreated with others,

397
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,240
but you didn’t.

398
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,560
You rushed out with Gao Liang

399
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,080
and saved him.

400
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,440
Why were you doing these?

401
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,800
Comrades,

402
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,880
think about it, everyone.

403
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,120
What made you

404
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,480
recklessly charge at the enemy.

405
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,000
You carried your comrades behind your backs, hold them in your arms,

406
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,400
and blocked bullets with your chests.

407
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,160
It is the determination to live and die together

408
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,560
that drives you.

409
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,960
We are soldiers,

410
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,160
and soldiers have to face war.

411
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,400
War is not an end, but a means.

412
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,960
The ultimate goal is for peace.

413
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,600
Only when we live and die together,

414
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,160
our army, which exists for war

415
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,980
[Live and die together]

416
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,640
and takes peace as its ultimate goal,

417
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,960
is an army with feelings,

418
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,320
an army that is invincible

419
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,880
but can defeat all enemies.

420
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,960
Your Company was outstanding

421
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,960
in this battle.

422
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,400
In the position,

423
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,040
you watched for 39 hours,

424
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,720
creating a favorable opportunity for our army

425
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,840
to wipe out the Division 177 of the enemy,

426
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,960
and you are sure to make great contributions.

427
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,240
Your Regiment has been reported.

428
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,320
The title of the Hero Company for standing your ground,

429
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,440
in my opinion,

430
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,800
is not as good as Live and Die Together.

431
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,440
Report to Chief,

432
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,080
please call us the Company of Live and Die Together.

433
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,240
Yeah, call us the Company of Live and die together.

434
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:21,920
Qin Hanyong.

435
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,200
Yes.

436
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,480
What’s your viewpoint?

437
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,720
If the Ninth Company can be rated as the Meritorious Company,

438
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,680
it is called the Company of Live and Die Together.

439
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,760
I will not return to the Regiment 700 either.

440
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,120
I will stay in the Ninth company.

441
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,560
With the brothers of the Ninth Company,

442
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,880
we live and die together.

443
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,880
Live and die together.

444
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,280
Cheers.

445
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,480
Have a seat and pour the wine.

446
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,440
Come on.

447
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,880
Hail, Chief.

448
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,440
Zhao, why are you here?

449
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,040
Report to Chief.

450
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,360
I came to fulfill my promise

451
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,200
and hope Chief will approve.

452
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:08,920
A promise?

453
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,400
Promise to whom?

454
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,120
Qin Hanyong.

455
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,720
What’s going on?

456
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,680
This is the first time.

457
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,360
I said

458
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,920
as long as you come back alive,

459
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:51,920
I will hug you ten times

460
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,440
in public.

461
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,840
Great.

462
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,440
- Great.
- Great.

463
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,040
- Great.
- Great.

464
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:11,900
[Never shed tears even for bloody sweat. Never be left behind even being peeled of the meat.]

465
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,960
Division Commander, slow down.

466
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,760
Division Commander was happy

467
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,640
when he left,

468
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,320
the soldiers were refreshed.

469
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,120
Qin Hanyong.

470
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,760
Colonel.

471
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,240
Well done

472
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,880
today.

473
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,960
I didn’t arrange it.

474
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,440
It’s Gao Liang.

475
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,760
Gao Liang.

476
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,040
He got the pulse of the Division Commander

477
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,680
and the pulse of

478
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,480
the officers and soldiers of the Ninth Company.

479
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,680
It was he who told Division Commander

480
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,520
about Gu Yiye.

481
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,160
He also said about

482
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,720
the Company’s flag.

483
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,200
This guy’s

484
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,680
got something.

485
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,040
Colonel,

486
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,880
please handle the Death Notice of Zhang Fei

487
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,520
as soon as possible.

488
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,040
His family

489
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,000
has been waiting in the hotel in town.

490
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,520
There are also notices of

491
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,720
other officers and soldiers in the Company who have sacrificed their lives.

492
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,480
Please handle them as soon as possible.

493
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,480
Song Jianshe,

494
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,840
put a rush on it.

495
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,840
They have been approved for more than ten days.

496
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,000
We can’t keep people waiting all the time.

497
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I’ve pushed it.

498
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,640
I’ll go again.

499
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,600
Let me show you.

500
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,040
This is the canned meat I saved and

501
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,040
didn’t eat.

502
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,080
It can be kept for a long time when taken home.

503
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,680
Take it back and taste it.

504
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,000
And this, this is awesome.

505
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,400
It’s called a 761-can box,

506
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,240
which is used to hold compressed biscuits.

507
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,680
We eat this at the front

508
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,480
to satisfy our hunger.

509
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,600
I've got a whole box for you.

510
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,880
Go home and share it to the villagers.

511
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,640
Let them taste it.

512
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,120
Don’t eat too much.

513
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,120
If you eat too much, it will swell to death as soon as you drink water.

514
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,520
Here you are.

515
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,440
And this.

516
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,720
Guess what this is.

517
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,480
What’s this?

518
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,880
The pull ring of a grenade.

519
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,320
Hang curtains.

520
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,880
It’s a curtain ring or something. It works great.

521
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,680
I saved more than one hundred for you.

522
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,440
See.

523
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,240
Give me all these?

524
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,440
Oh, no.

525
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,960
I can’t take the things from the Army.

526
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,000
Who are you?

527
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,640
You are a relative of the Army,

528
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,400
right?

529
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,920
It will be very hard for me

530
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,760
to make such a clear distinction between you and us.

531
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,600
The Ninth Company will be sad. The Army will be sadder!

532
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,760
There’s more. Wait for it.

533
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,480
Let me show you.

534
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:48,560
This...

535
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,280
Company Commander.

536
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,560
Comrade Gu.

537
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,920
Come in, please.

538
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,440
Come in!

539
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,200
Company Commander.

540
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:04,060
[Create the wonderful future for motherland.]

541
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,640
Have a seat, please. I’ll get you a glass of water.

542
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,280
I’ll do it.

543
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,160
I’ll do it.

544
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,920
Look at you, so careless all the time.

545
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,560
You should criticize him more, or he won’t learn.

546
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,880
Comrade Gao, you shouldn’t be like that.

547
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,200
You are the one that’s careless.

548
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,120
Gu is really careful.

549
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,080
Right.

550
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,080
Sister-in-law…

551
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,240
What are you saying?

552
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,320
Call her Xiu.

553
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,520
“Sister-in-law” sounds so distant.

554
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,520
Xiu sounds like a family.

555
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,120
Don’t just stand there.

556
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,880
You all take a sit. Come, sit.

557
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,640
Commander.

558
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,440
I brought you

559
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,400
some specialties from my hometown.

560
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,360
This,

561
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,720
this is citrus honey.

562
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,280
I kept the bees myself and made the honey.

563
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,320
Bring it back, bring it back so everyone can have a taste.

564
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,440
Right, and this.

565
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,480
I picked them fresh, it’s really good.

566
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,800
Bring them all back.

567
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,360
And this, all these are sweetened, fried flour.

568
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,720
These are sweetened, fried flour.

569
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,720
And this,

570
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,160
this is sweet ginger slice, it’s for you.

571
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,680
You take it back.

572
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,800
Only for him,

573
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,240
and we don’t get any, huh?

574
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,120
Are you coughing too?

575
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,120
You can share it.

576
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,920
I heard him coughing last time, so…

577
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,480
Take a few slices every day,

578
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,400
and you’ll recover in several days.

579
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,680
Sister-in-law,

580
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,600
Xiu, thank you.

581
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,520
Why are you thanking me, it’s already said

582
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,880
that we are a family.

583
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,320
You don’t have to say thank you to a family.

584
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,680
Right, there’s more.

585
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,960
I also brought this.

586
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,360
A whole big bag of rice flour.

587
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,000
I just don’t know if it’s enough

588
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
for the comrades in the company.

589
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:33,880
It’s enough.

590
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
Comrade Xiu, don’t work around.

591
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,440
Let’s sit and talk for a while.

592
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,520
Just say it.

593
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,000
Say, say what?

594
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,640
Things about Zhang Fei.

595
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,800
You haven’t spoken of him

596
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,320
since you came in.

597
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,400
This does not seem like his comrades-in-arms.

598
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,200
Um, comrade Xiu,

599
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,560
this,

600
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,640
this is Zhang Fei’s combat expense.

601
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,160
You can count it.

602
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,640
Is this the

603
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,160
disability pension?

604
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,920
No, no, definitely not!

605
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,240
Then I won’t take it.

606
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,880
He earned the money. You should give it to him.

607
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,120
I’m sorry, I’m sorry.

608
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,480
You talk, you go ahead.

609
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,280
Commander,

610
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,920
comrade Gao and Gu,

611
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,880
this is not like my home.

612
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,760
Just say what you have to say

613
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,400
and you can go back to rest

614
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,400
and let others rest earlier too, alright?

615
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,360
Just say it.

616
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,720
Thank you for coming to see me.

617
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,640
I know

618
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,440
you came here

619
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,000
because you have to say something to me,

620
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,240
but you can’t spit it out.

621
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,760
I also know

622
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,480
the military just experienced the war,

623
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,160
and there’re a lot of things need to be taken care of,

624
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,160
so I won’t take up too much of everyone’s time.

625
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,240
Commander,

626
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,000
when I and Fei boy got married,

627
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,240
we didn’t even hold the wedding

628
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,680
before he went to the frontline.

629
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,200
You see now that the war was over,

630
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,400
is it possible for the military

631
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,680
to reissue me a letter of introduction for marriage?

632
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,720
This,

633
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,160
this, I…

634
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,000
I know,

635
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,640
it’s the war,

636
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,200
and it’s dangerous.

637
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,080
Zhang Fei was on frontline.

638
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,360
That’s right to the danger.

639
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,680
I am prepared.

640
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,280
In this whole year,

641
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,400
in my heart,

642
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,360
I have constantly been worrying.

643
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,560
I heard the broadcast that you came back,

644
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,960
so I settled the things at home,

645
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,920
and came here overnight.

646
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,640
This time you came,

647
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,760
but Zhang Fei’s not here,

648
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,320
and you are not talking about him,

649
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,000
then I knew what’s happening.

650
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,960
I thought about it.

651
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,190
It’s nothing,

652
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,920
so long as he’s still alive.

653
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:26,230
Even if he’s hurt, disabled,

654
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,670
or lost an arm or a leg,

655
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,630
that does not matter.

656
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,520
I won’t complain about the military for once.

657
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,960
I’ll take him home,

658
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,560
and treat him like a hero.

659
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,520
And,

660
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,080
I won’t bother the troop after.

661
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,520
I’ll take care of him for my whole life.

662
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,260
[Dormitory]

663
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,040
Welcome sister-in-law, welcome, welcome!

664
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,800
Welcome sister-in-law, greatly welcome!

665
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:43,540
[Army Infantry battalion]

666
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,280
Sergeant,

667
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,400
since I saw you the first time

668
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,240
on the platform for new recruits,

669
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,000
I thought you were very nice.

670
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,360
Does it hurt?

671
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:19,960
No.

672
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,800
Then hurry up and get in.

673
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,760
If

674
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,680
I can’t be such an excellent soldier

675
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,960
in my life,

676
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,960
then the soldiers I’m responsible for should be.

677
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,920
Yiye, I really like you guys very much,

678
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,080
especially you.

679
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,960
In the troop,

680
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,160
I’m the platoon leader and you are the sergeant.

681
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,480
But when it’s just us,

682
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,000
you are like my brother,

683
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,360
my real brother.

684
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,320
When you face something difficult and dangerous,

685
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,280
you need to have a faith

686
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,480
in your mind.

687
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,600
Leader,

688
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,560
don’t you have Xiu?

689
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,200
You always had a smile on your face,

690
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,920
and you were so truthful

691
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,120
to everyone.

692
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,040
When I was most difficult

693
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,720
and disliked,

694
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,760
it was you

695
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,840
that always stayed with me,

696
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,400
comforted me,

697
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,240
and encouraged me.

698
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,360
I always said I didn’t have a brother.

699
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,080
I really hope,

700
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,280
really wish that you were my brother.

701
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,360
But until the moment

702
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,240
you took the landmine for me,

703
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,080
Drop down!

704
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,320
I haven’t called you brother for once.

705
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,560
All us Ninth Squad is waiting for you,

706
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,120
Xiu is waiting for you too.

707
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,760
How should she live alone?

708
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,920
How could you?

709
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,240
How could you?

710
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,320
How should she live alone?

711
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,360
How should she?

712
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:12,960
Commander,

713
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,480
Mancang

714
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,720
has been on sentry duty for three continuous nights.

715
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,280
He said he’s doing it for his sacrificed comrades.

716
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,520
During the day,

717
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,160
he just sits in the room,

718
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,040
eyes staring,

719
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,480
not talking to anyone,

720
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,840
and he doesn’t eat.

721
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,240
If this continues,

722
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,640
even if he’s immortal, he won’t hold on.

723
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,560
I talked to him,

724
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,560
so did Gao Liang and Gu Yiye.

725
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,040
What if

726
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,120
I go and try?

728
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,160
ready to change guard.

729
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,800
Comrade,

730
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,440
the sentry post is all normal,

731
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,160
clear to change guard.

732
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,280
I remember that

733
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,520
Jiagui and you

734
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,200
were both born from farming families.

738
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,720
weren’t you?

740
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,360
across the same river,

741
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,560
with my family being in the upstream,

742
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,640
while his in the downstream.

743
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,200
Jiagui said that

744
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,680
by jumping into the river,

745
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,280
I could drift to his place.

746
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:55,260
[Forging Blood Soldiers]

747
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,440
We had made an agreement

748
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,000
which was going back home

749
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,960
and visiting our families together,

750
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,000
thus the trip would be more enjoyable.

He said that

752
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,800
he would take me to watch casting iron,

753
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,440
which, in his opinion,

754
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,160
was gorgeous.

755
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,520
This

756
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,320
was found in Jiagui’s package.

757
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,280
It’s for you.

758
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,080
Come on,

[To: Niu Mancang]

760
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,240
I’ll stand guard for you.

761
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,320
Come on.

762
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,280
Niu, thanks for taking me home.

[Shu Jiagui]

764
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,320
Let’s go have a cigarette.

765
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:58,730
♫ The dawn, breaking through the sunshine, falls upon the ground. ♫

766
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:06,150
♫ The pain from before sharpens the ages. ♫

767
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:13,460
♫ The tracks from the past will be embalmed in the hearts. ♫

768
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:20,970
♫ My brother, the victorious trumpet has sounded. ♫

769
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:27,840
♫ I ignite myself. ♫

770
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:31,480
♫ With all my courage, ♫

771
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,130
♫ I face everything, never shirking, ♫

772
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,850
♫ since we’re together. ♫

773
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,420
♫ One life, one destiny. ♫

774
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:49,980
♫ We will be brothers in our next lives. ♫

775
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:48,060
[Never shed tears even for bloody sweat. Never be left behind even being peeled of the meat.]

776
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:02,950
Hello.
