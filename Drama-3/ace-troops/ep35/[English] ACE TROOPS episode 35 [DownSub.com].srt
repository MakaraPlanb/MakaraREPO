00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,840
How much did your decision weigh in this?

192
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,200
I...

193
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,440
My decision...

194
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,880
No.

195
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,040
I didn't get you, Army Commander.

196
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,680
Let me ask you, Chen Dashan.

197
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,640
What is it about Yu Sizhe?

198
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,600
He is just a leader at the platoon level.

199
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,760
Was it necessary that you, a division commander,

200
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,360
transferred him from the office

201
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,560
to the company for acting capacity?

202
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,760
He can't even do

203
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,920
pull-ups.

204
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,720
And yet,

205
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,800
he went to First Battalion of the Red,

206
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,080
the top training model battalion

207
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,680
to work as platoon leader.

208
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,800
And a merit citation class III was given away to him.

209
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,640
With this career experience

210
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,000
and military medal,

211
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,880
he can rightfully

212
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,640
be promoted in advance

213
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,120
for the next step, right?

214
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,760
You have calculated so well.

215
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,260
But this military medal

216
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,880
is too heavy.

217
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,680
It was at the cost

218
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,520
of a primary-level cadre's hand.

219
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,760
Army Commander.

220
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,800
Yu Sizhe had an upper-level connection.

221
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,880
It was the Chief's instruction.

222
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,720
I swear,

223
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,920
I have no selfish motives in this.

224
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,560
I did this for Division 234,

225
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,280
and also for the long-term construction of the army.

226
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,760
I have done my research.

227
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,160
Yu Sizhe's father is a real estate agent.

228
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,560
Got deals with him?

229
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,480
This can't count as a deal.

230
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,560
There has to be a price for a deal.

231
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,000
How much is it?

232
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,440
It has nothing to do with money.

233
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,920
This is nothing about money.

234
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,720
Chen Dashan.

235
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,880
Please, ask for the price for me.

236
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,320
What...what price?

237
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,880
Come here.

238
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,080
Chen Dashan.

239
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,920
I want you to ask the Americans for me,

240
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,240
that how many benefits

241
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,320
or how much money shall I give them

242
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,300
to stop them from bombing us?

243
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,500
[Strong condemn against the encroachment by the US-led NATO]

244
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,680
Tell me,

245
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
how much

246
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,600
shall we pay to redeem the three lives of Chinese people?

247
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,640
How much

248
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,520
is enough to remove

249
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,520
the dark clouds pressing down on the 2.5 million Liberation Army?

250
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,380
[Strong condemn against the encroachment by the US-led NATO]

251
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,680
How much

252
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,240
is enough to buy the tears and humiliation

253
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,360
suffered by 1.2 billion Chinese people?

254
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,920
Let me tell you, Chen Dashan.

255
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,160
Division 234

256
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,440
is the old troop for Xiao Changsheng and me.

257
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,200
For social connections,

258
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,760
you placed unqualified people in here,

259
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,640
and kicked out the qualified one.

260
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,990
Are you doing deals,

261
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,280
or making long-term plans?

262
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,120
No.

263
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,570
You are poaching from Division 234.

264
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,800
You are poaching from the Liberation Army.

265
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,360
You are poaching from the Chinese people.

266
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,680
You betrayed them.

267
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,840
Army Commander.

268
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,360
It's all my fault.

269
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,840
I will bring Gu Yiye back.

270
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,120
I will not dismiss you.

271
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,280
Thank you, Army Commander.

272
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,080
I will correct my faults.

273
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,040
I will kick you out.

274
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,600
You are not even qualified

275
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,600
to be an ordinary soldier here.

276
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,480
You don't deserve it.

277
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:07,960
Go.

278
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,760
Yes.

279
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,760
I have lived in this yard

280
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,520
for more than ten years.

281
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,240
I'm about to move away.

282
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,440
Here.

283
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,200
I brought here

284
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,000
roast sweet potatoes

285
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,320
and fried rice-flour noodles.

286
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,920
Do you remember the last time we had these?

287
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,160
Yes.

288
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,520
It was back when you were company commander,

289
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,280
and we ate these before you took me to the battlefield.

290
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,200
I couldn't eat.

291
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,640
You forced me

292
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,920
to eat them all.

293
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,640
You said that

294
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
we can only fight the enemy when we have strength from the food.

295
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,040
I remember that

296
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,440
it was my first time seeing action.

297
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,160
I was a little afraid.

298
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,880
But you kept on encouraging me.

299
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,560
Later, we charged forward,

300
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,560
took the highland

301
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,080
and won.

302
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,760
It was you

303
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,520
who gave me courage.

304
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,280
Chen Dashan.

305
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:34,960
During fights,

306
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,600
you always take the lead.

307
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,760
I remember you were promoted on the battlefield.

308
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,440
After that,

309
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,800
you served longest as a battalion commander

310
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,280
and the longest as a colonel.

311
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,520
Do you hate me?

312
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,240
I never hated you.

313
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,400
You are nice to me,

314
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,200
so I'm willing to serve you with my life.

315
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,440
I'm willing to complete every mission you assigned

316
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,560
with all my capacity.

317
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,440
I don't want to embarrass you.

318
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,400
You didn't take possession of

319
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:15,640
the fund given by the real estate investor.

320
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,240
You used it to

321
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,880
rebuild the Division History Museum

322
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,980
and build the culture corridor.

323
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,410
Did you do all these

324
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,480
to show the leaders?

325
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,400
I, Chen Dashan,

326
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,880
have not one bit selfish motives

327
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,160
in front of our country and our army.

328
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,000
I spent every penny

329
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,160
of that money

330
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,800
on troop construction.

331
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:42,960
Sit down.

332
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,160
If you did take possession of the money,

333
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,960
would you still be sitting here today?

334
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,640
Do you know

335
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,400
why I have to let you go this time?

336
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,400
It was written in the yard of Division 234

337
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,360
"The first battle with me".

338
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,520
Yet, you put someone

339
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,880
with absolutely no military skills

340
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,040
on the artillery position.

341
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,160
For the sake of a relative family's kid,

342
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,560
you kicked out the battalion commander

343
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,800
who had the deepest study on modernized war

344
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,320
in our division.

345
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,960
It seems that

346
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,960
you, Chen Dashan, has no idea

347
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,480
of the ace troop Division 234's

348
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,560
construction directions.

349
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,480
We have to replace you

350
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,720
as a commander.

351
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,480
Army Commander.

352
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,800
I was...

353
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,640
The foundation of troop traditions and work style

354
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,640
is the quality of soldiers.

355
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,600
What is an army for?

356
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,160
If we can't win in the battlefield,

357
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,880
then we are nothing.

358
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,080
There has been major military revolution in the world these years.

359
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,720
I lost count on how many times

360
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,120
the military equipment has evolved.

361
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,360
At this critical time,

362
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,480
we have to foster

363
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,200
and make good use of primary-level cadres

364
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,080
to prepare for troop construction

365
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,000
and military struggle,

366
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,280
to provide new military talents

367
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,560
and intelligence support for them,

368
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,640
to raise the troops' fighting capacity.

369
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,520
Division 234 has been focusing

370
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,840
too much on living these years,

371
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,000
with ack of fighting capacity.

372
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,400
Chen Dashan,

373
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,440
you have drifted off course.

374
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,360
You even became a bystander during battle preparation.

375
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,560
You lost

376
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,520
the vigilance of war during peaceful times.

377
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,000
Army Commander.

378
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,120
If me leaving the troop

379
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,000
is the best way

380
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,800
to shoulder my responsibility for those commanders

381
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,680
who love the troop

382
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,480
and are ready for battle

383
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,000
at all times,

384
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,120
I, Chen Dashan,

385
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,520
am willing to do this.

386
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:29,540
[Six months later]

387
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,960
Chen Dashan has transferred to civilian work.

388
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,440
What Zheng did

389
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,440
was just like Fight fire with fire in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

390
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,640
Chen Dashan used to be

391
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,720
his beloved man.

392
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,080
I know what it felt like to take off the military uniform.

393
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,600
It hurt.

394
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,280
Division Commander Chen transferred to civilian work.

395
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,600
I was quite sad about it.

396
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,880
Actually, he had always tried hard

397
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,240
to be a good soldier.

398
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,200
Yes.

399
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,320
But I have to say that

400
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,160
to the troop,

401
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,960
Chen Dashan's leaving is a good thing.

402
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,640
I had never seen my father

403
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,760
cry silently for anybody like this before.

404
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,400
Yiye.

405
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,440
The expensive sovereign remedy

406
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,800
that Hu Yang sent every month from abroad,

407
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,400
you asked her to do that, right?

408
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,640
No.

409
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,440
She offered to send it herself.

410
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,480
For free.

411
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,040
Why would she do such a nice thing?

412
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,840
Because of this military uniform,

413
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,120
she treats you like

414
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,320
a special patient to her.

415
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,040
To be frank,

416
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,920
I'm quite impressed,

417
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,120
with great respect for her.

418
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,240
Do you think I should thank her,

419
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,480
or thank my military uniform for this?

420
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,320
Thank yourself first.

421
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,680
Kiss yourself

422
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
in the mirror for three times.

423
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,120
With clear sound.

424
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,080
No problem.

425
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,680
Then Nanzheng,

426
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,120
you know how to thank her, right?

427
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,480
You don't need my help.

428
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,240
Look at you, alright,

429
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,280
teach me how to thank her.

430
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,080
You bad boy.

431
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,200

At ease.

440

Attention.

441
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,440
Report to you, Battalion Commander.

442
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,240
From all the officers and soldiers of Second Battalion of Special Forces.

443
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,760
Welcome back to the training field, Battalion Commander.

444
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,600
Welcome back to the training field, Battalion Commander.

445
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,200
Please review, Battalion Commander.

446
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,080
Please review, Battalion Commander.

447
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,560
Gao Liangmi.

448
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,240
Stand up.

449
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,840
You can do it.

450
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,680
Salute!

451
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,680
Gao Liang really stood up.

452
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,240
But his body has a permanent disability.

453
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,720
He said to me that

454
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,080
he is a disabled person now.

455
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,080
He doesn't have the strength to chase after me anymore.

456
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,600
I should fulfill my promise

457
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,400
to let him leave after he stood up.

458
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,600
This reason was dumbfounding to me.

459
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,800
When Gao Liang said it,

460
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,160
his eyes

461
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,760
were resolute

462
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,160
and serious.

463
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,440
Even a little bit calmness there.

464
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,880
That was something I had never seen before.

465
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,560
He was strange to me.

466
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,040
I think

467
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,000
we both need to face

468
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,200
and accept ourselves going through changes.

469
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,120
Bearing each other in mind

470
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,440
keeps us from feeling lonely.

471
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,240
In our busy lives,

472
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,560
we will march forward hastily,

473
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,240
and become leading figures in each other's fields

474
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,360
for this rapidly-developing troop.

475
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,920
I believe

476
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,080
we will meet again.

481
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,280

482

Stand up.

483
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,240
Comrades.

484
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,600
First, I'd like to congratulate you

485
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,160
on completing the mission of this drill.

486
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,400
You were very passionate about the drill.

487
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,560
Individual actions

488
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,760
were completed perfectly.

Tactic movement coordination

490
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,680
were also seamless.

491
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,280
Having seen this,

492
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,760
I'm very pleased.

However,

494
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,880
I have experienced this kind of pleasure

495
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,880
for many years.

[Li Shaobing Chief of Division 234, Troop A]

501
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,720
should be changed.

Battlefield

503
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,920
is the only standard

504
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,080
to testify if a troop is capable for fighting.

505
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,480
On a real modern battlefield,

506
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,560
will you survive or not,

507
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,760
will you win again?

508
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,280
Half a month later,

509
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,480
there will be a military drill in the Military Command

510
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,320
which will be very similar to actual combat.

511
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,800
Those who participate

512
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,120
will be selected from the troops of each group army.

513
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,400
Comrades from different offices

514
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,360
and military executives at division and regiment levels

515
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,200
will form an observation team

516
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,160
and operate full-on observation

517
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,320
as observers.

518
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,600
I have seen your plan.

519
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,400
We have to make adjustments to it.

520
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,120
Combat won't wait for anybody,

521
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,760
and it won't start according to your schedule.

522
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,400
As soon as the gunshot was fired,

523
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,280
our troops have to rush out.

524
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,280
There's no time for you to tie your ties.

525

526
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,520
Zheng suddenly

527
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,320
announced the drill will be ahead of schedule.

528
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,720
He seemed to be disappointed about our report this time.

529
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,120
He was just promoted to Chief of the Military Command.

530
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,680
It seems that the training style will be changed in the command.

531
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,760
The report performance was very good-looking,

532
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,680
but how much essence is in there,

533
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,880
don't we know clearly?

534
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,120
We were courting death

535
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,600
trying to fool Zheng with this.

536
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,280
But

537
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,720
we have been testing all the old training stuff over the past few years.

538
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,520
No wonder Zheng was pissed off.

539
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,280
But even if we change the training stuff like recipe,

540
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,600
we can only switch radish to green vegetables,

541
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,040
but we can't change the salt.

542
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,760
The Regiment 700 of Division 234

543
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,000
is just like salt to Army A.

544
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,160
No matter what you change, you have to fight with me.

545
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,520
Is there a possibility that

546
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,360
our Special Operations Battalion

547
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,720
won't get together with you "salt"?

548
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,880
We won't follow the trail of

549
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,120
you focusing on the besiegement and us focusing on fortified positions.

550
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,160
We can imitate Zheng

551
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,760
and let Special Operations Battalion and Regiment 700 fight against each other.

552
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,920
It's very likely.

553
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,400
Let me make it clear.

554
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,200
I hate you Special Operations Battalion.

555
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,520
The elites of Regiment 700

556
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,960
were all stolen by you.

557
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,040
Judged by status,

558
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,160
we can say we Regiment 700 gave birth to Special Operations Battalion.

559
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,640
No matter where you go, you have to call me father.

560
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,280
All the benefits came to you.

561
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,440
You should be the son,

562
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,440
while you took everything away.

563
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,270
Alright.

00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,160
The desolate father is still a father.

00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,220
Tell me when.

568
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,160
I totally understand you, Li.

570
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,560
you are the Chief of Division 234 now.

571
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,800
Don't act like a colonel.

572
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,440
You are focusing on the small picture, you know?

573
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,800
On the position of a Chief,

574
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,000
you should turn in

If we don't achieve some good results,

578
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,000
then you, the only captain in the Military Command

579
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,840
in the post of deputy division commander,

580
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,960
won't have a good time either.

is Qiaotou Island,

which is 12 nautical miles from the naval training field.

610
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,600
The content of the drill

611
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,640
is to capture and control the island.

612
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,840
The length of the drill

613
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,800
is 48 hours.

is "Operation Azure".

The Red Army

617
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,760

how will you do it?

All the chiefs are here,

643
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,720
so I will do whatever

644
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,760
the chiefs ask me to.

645
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,120
Sit down.

646
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:18,840
Yes.

648
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,440
Here.

649
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,320
What about you?

650
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,080
According to different operational needs

651
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,680
and different targets,

652
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,040
we should adopt different operational modes.

653
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,360
Naval sabotage operations

654
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,600
require the use of all measures

655
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,430
to control, attack and hit the target.

656
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,760
However, for island scramble,

657
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,280
I think we should adopt the way of

658
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,760
attack without destroy

659
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,480
to achieve the goal of making it work for me.

660
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,240
I don't understand.

661
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,330
Tell us how can you make it work for you?

662
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,250
Qiaotou Island

663
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,310
was once used by the Japanese troops as the naval fortress.

664
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,380
[Defense Layout of Qiaotou Island]

665
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,080
They sent mass engineer corps

666
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,320
and labor workers

667
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,560
to build in three years

668
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,160
a solid fort

669
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,040
with a shooting angle of 360 degrees

670
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,000
on the island.

671
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,760
Also, they built a fortification system

672
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,920
deep down the ground.

673
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,400
There's also a freshwater factory under the cliff.

674
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,320
Bunkers were all over the island,

675
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,960
so it was basically hollow.

676
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,720
An island like this

677
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,200
can't be blown up.

678
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,170
Last year,

679
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,900
I went on the island

680
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,960
with Deputy Navy Commander Zhu,

681
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,240
and visited the underground fortifications.

682
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,480
The facilities were basically in good condition.

683
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,200
After the Nationalist Party fled to Taiwan,

684
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,560
they once used this island

685
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,920
as the outpost of counterattacking the main land.

686
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,040
They upgraded and rebuilt

687
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,760
the fortifications left by the Japanese troops.

688
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,680
They accredited

689
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,440
a thousand-people army there.

690
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,320
In the early 50s,

691
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,920
our army once took this place

692
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,840
as the top capturing target

693
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,560
in the coastal island capture battles.

694
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,520
After several times of

695
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,880
three-dimensional attacks of amphibious forces,

696
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,400
the battle commander

697
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,720
still couldn't give the command

698
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,920
to operate attack.

699
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,760
Instead, he took the detour

700
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,800
and spent six years of battle.

701
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,160
The food source was cut out on the Qiaotou Island,

702
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,720
so the defense troops' confidence was crashed,

703
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,320
and they had to leave the island on vessels.

704
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,760
You studied this period of history?

705
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,800
This is the research topic

706
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,050
of my father's study.

707
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,520
The Chief Director

708
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,600
of this island capture drill

709
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,340
referred to this exact period of history.

710
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:12,550
Go on.

711
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,800
The military tactic is

712
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,230
to surround the enemy with ten times of forces and attack with five times.

713
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,710
The major force of Red and Blue Army has a gap of less than five times,

714
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:20,840
therefore, if we Regiment 700

715
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,389
will be defending the island,

716
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,560
we won't lose

717
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,520
Qiaotou Island

718
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,659
in two days.

719
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:28,840
How come only two days?

720
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
In five days,

721
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,150
Special Operations Battalion

722
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,280
can't even take one piece of stone from the island.

723
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,960
I won't need 48 hours

724
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,360
to grasp all of your people.

725
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,670
Wait a second.

726
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,320
The Drill Command decided

727
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,440
to let Regiment 700

728
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,630
defend the island,

729
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,320
while Special Operations Battalion captures.

730
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,000
Yes.

731
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,230
For what reasons?

732
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,600
Special Operations Battalion operated island capture training

733
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,400
earlier than other troops.

734
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,560
They are experienced.

735
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,280
Regiment 700

736
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,700
has always operated positional warfare.

737
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,960
So they are confident about this.

738
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,560
If I may say, we should switch it.

739
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,790
Let the pig-butchers go lasso a horse,

740
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,090
and let the hunters go sheep-herding.

741
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,080
Let Special Operations Battalion defend the island,

742
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,020
and Regiment 700 capture it.

743
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,600
Make them step out of their comfort zone.

744
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,280
Chief.

[Defense Layout of Qiaotou Island]

746
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,520
Special Operations Battalion has always

747
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,200
shouldered the mission of special operations.

748
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,720
It may not be suitable for them

749
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,160
to defend the island.

750
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,840
This drill is to expose our problems

751
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,840
and raise the real fighting capacity of the troop.

752
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,680
Any more questions?

00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,800
You said that

755
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,720
the observation team will go on the island.

756
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,920
Members of the team

757
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,720
are composed of leaders from Military Command offices

758
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,280
and the troops participating in the drill.

759
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,960
The executives will be above regiment level.

760
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,400
Any attack operated by the Red Army

761
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,160
shall not harm the safety of the observation team.

762
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,980
The Blue Army will assure the safety of the observation team

763
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,740
beside the normal drill missions.

764
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,410
If there's a violation by either side,

765
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,440
it will be regarded as defeat.

766
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,800
We will all be busy fighting,

767
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,600
how can we keep an eye on them?

768
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,640
The drill is not only to solve problems in the troops,

769
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,160
but also the commanding capacity.

770
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,040
Put it in this way,

771
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,760
the island capture operation

772
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,160
is not only a combat between the Red and Blue Army,

773
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,600
but it involves the whole Military Command.

774
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,680
We have to put brains in it.

775
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,520
We won't be discussing this anymore.

776
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,640
It's settled.

777
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,920
If there's no other opinions from the Red and Blue Army,

778
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,280
the Director Department will make changes

779
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,040
according to the original attack and defense settings.

780
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,840
And we will operate

781
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,760
according to the current plan.

782
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,720
Wait a minute.

783
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,120
What did you say?

784
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,520
You will be busy fighting?

785
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,400
The Blue Army should follow the battalion system,

786
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,880
why are you, a captain,

787
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,160
gettin involved in here?

788
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,960
What I meant was that...

789
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,600
Chief,

790
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,480
the drills have always been like this.

791
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,240
The commanding office will raise a level.

792
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,000
This is what I hate

793
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,380
about your pretentious drills.

794
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,000
You take training as performance.

795
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,240
You let commanders at different levels

796
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,760
compete to go on stage and grab the microphone.

797
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,560
Those who really fight a battle

798
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,850
have no right to command at all.

799
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,360
Change the drill settings.

800
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,600
You have already changed them.

801
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,800
Yes, chief.

802
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,560
The commanding rights will be delegated to the regiment level.

803
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:00,920
You will pick out

804
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,700
the regiment-level commanders on each side

805
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,440
to be real commanders.

806
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,760
It will be fine with the Blue Army.

807
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,810
But the Red Army has

808
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,230
the enhanced regiment settings now.

809
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,600
I'm afraid...

810
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,400
Afraid of what?

811
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,560
It won't happen because you are afraid?

812
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,120
No one wants wars.

813
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,880
No one wants to fight.

814
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,920
Do you think you can just dodge that?

815
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,080
Take it as

816
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,200
the commanding office of the Red Army has been destroyed.

817
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,860
The commanding rights are delegated.

818
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,640
Stop following me.

819
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,680
Go back and assign missions.

820
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,760
Division commander, without your instructions,

821
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,080
Yiye can't make his decisions.

822
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,640
Yes, Division Commander.

823
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,600
Our regiment needs division instructions.

824
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:50,600
Without the backbone of Division Commander,

825
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,760
we are just clueless.

826
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,140
We don't know where to attack at all.

827
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,080
Right.

828
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,620
From now on,

829
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,120
the commanding rights of the Red Army

830
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,280
will be handed to Gu Yiye.

831
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,280
Yes.

832
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,200
Stay out of it.

833
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:09,450
As you instructed, Division Commander.

834
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:10,640
Yiye.

835
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,320
I won't say more

836
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,720
about the importance of this drill.

837
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,440
However,

838
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:16,940
bear it in mind that

839
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,720
it's not important to make impressions,

840
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,680
just don't make mistakes.

841
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,470
Put the safety and stability of the troop

842
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,710
as priority.

843
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:25,800
Yes.

844
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,240
Division Commander,

845
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,520
you are so right.

846
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:28,730
Before the drill,

847
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:29,810
I motivated the troop in person

848
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:31,970
on the topic of

849
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:33,570
assuring the safety and stability of troops

850
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:35,210
under the new circumstances and features in the new era.

851
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:36,610
Stay out of it, will you?

852
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:38,650
Don't you understand the Chief?

853
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,450
We will let the youngsters shoulder great responsibilities

854
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:42,970
to train the troop.

855
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:44,480
What are you getting involved for?

856
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,530
Here.

857
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:50,970
It's so hot.

858
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,450
Look at you, so happy.

859
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,810
With no one covering for you now,

860
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:01,570
are you satisfied?

861
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,130
Or you can just dismiss me,

862
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:03,930
if you don't care about win or lose.

863
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:05,170
Special Operations Battalion isn't afraid of defeat anyway.

864
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,250
Stop it.

865
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,880
Can you bear your leg injuries?

866
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,840
I have participated in countless tryouts with the injuries,

867
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,200
and I never had a bad result.

868
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,120
My leg will only be lame

869
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,560
when there's no outsider here.

870
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,960
It works fine in other cases.

871
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,400
Alright.

872
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,920
Then let's talk about the observation team.

873
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,120
About the observation team, I feel...

874
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,640
Just let Mule Gu take care

875
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,400
of the observation team.

876
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,640
They have rear services and better conditions.

877
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,440
How do you know Regiment 700

878
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,640
will assign him as commander?

879
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,040
Get ready.

880
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,480
The division will fully support you.

881
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,330
If you need anything, personnel or facilities, just name it.

882
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,580
Thank you, Chief.

883
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,550
Please be assured.

884
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,940
I will definitely plant the flag of Regiment 700

885
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,760
on the main peak of Qiaotou Island.

886
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,780
48 hours.

887
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,400
We still need to add half the time.

888
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,280
Can't you see from the drill settings?

889
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,720
You haven't practiced island capture,

890
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,280
while Special Operations Battalion hasn't practiced positioned warfare.

891
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,560
Chief Zheng wants to dash the babies.

892
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,800
Only after the babies get hurt from the dash,

893
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,280
they can run around.

894
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,600
It's such a brutal move.

895
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,120
I made my move first

896
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,480
and studied Qiaotou Island.

897
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,960
Gao Liang hasn't done it yet.

898
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,480
He is still confused.

899
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,640
Do you think you are the landmine buried in Division 234

900
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,240
by the Chief Command War Department?

901
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,400
How do you know your opponent is Gao Liang?

902
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,160
Except for Gao Liang,

903
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,920
no one can stop me from getting on the island.

904
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,240
Special Operations Battalion

905
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,800
won't risk it.

906
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,240
We have already

907
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,320
assigned high-level lieutenant,

908
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,360
who will they assign to get beat?

909
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,360
Look at you, all cocky.

910
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,850
Don't get carried away.

911
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,400
The observation team won't participate in commanding

912
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:35,960
after they get on the island.

913
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:37,680
So they won't stand in your way.

914
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,200
Plus,

915
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,120
stop hating leaders from now on.

916
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,040
You should establish your determination

917
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,400
to love and respect your leaders.

918
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,320
Well,

919
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,080
it should be patience.

920
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:49,920
Same.

921
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,880
If there's no patience, there won't be determination

922
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,760
Patience will be nothing without determination.

923
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:54,800
I'm telling you,

924
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,160
I don't encourage you to approach

925
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,640
ther leaders,

926
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,240
but Chief Zheng is in charge of

927
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,960
the observation team.

928
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,560
Play it by ear.

929
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,280
Oh my god.

930
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,000
Just dismiss me already.

931
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,080
It's much harder than defending the island.

932
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,680
When did you become such a coward?

933
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,800
Is it that you recovered physically,

934
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,280
and got damaged mentally?

935
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,000
Hurry up.

936
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,280
You only have two days

937
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,160
to investigate terrain on the island in advance.

938
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,560
Ship the facilities onto the island

939
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:28,240
and claim two days' food and fresh water.

940
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,600
