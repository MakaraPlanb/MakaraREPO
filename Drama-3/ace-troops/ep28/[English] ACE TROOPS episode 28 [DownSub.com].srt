Good one.

I've never seen that before.

00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,800
We always think we're on top of the world

00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,600
As Deputy Commander Xiao said,

war is those who know how to fight fighting those who don't.

It's rude if I tell the truth,

This is the team job.

If it's safe,

45
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,800
then the second partner goes in to check another angle.

46

192
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,080
-Help me, Mom! -I'm taking him outside.

193
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,800
Let's go!

194
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,280
Let me go!

195
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,280
I'll go get you some fruit.

196
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,720
Come and get me!

197
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,900
[Love]

198
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,680
You can't get me!

199
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,240
Let me do it.

200
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,720
Xiaofei is naughty.

201
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,680
Comrade Gao must be tired.

202
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,120
He won't.

203
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,920
Gao is never tired.

204
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,080
Here, Xiu.

205
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:22,840
Take a seat.

206
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,320
Let me do it.

207
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,000
I got it.

208
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:40,920
Xiu,

209
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,480
my dad said that

210
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,840
he's not coming

211
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,360
to our wedding.

212
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,920
Is Uncle Gu

213
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,680
mad at me?

214
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,440
No way.

215
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,200
My dad likes you very much.

216
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,160
And he's happy to see

217
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,480
us getting married.

218
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,740
But this time…

219
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,750
Comrade Gu,

220
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,530
you don't have to comfort me.

221
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,490
It's my fault.

222
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,120
I know well

223
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,160
about my situation.

224
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,520
I just feel sorry

225
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,840
to make Uncle Gu unhappy.

226
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:16,960
Xiu,

227
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,240
the relationship between me and my dad

228
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
is unlike other father-son relationships.

229
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,000
Ours

230
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,760
is special.

231
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,040
Let me tell you a story.

232
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,440
My mom died when I was little,

233
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,080
and my dad tried to make me independent

234
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,280
since I was young.

235
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,200
I grew up in a boarding school,

236
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,240
so, the bond between my father and I

237
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,120
is different from that of others.

238
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,400
It's tacit,

239
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,440
but is never spoken.

240
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,800
It's like the dummy game.

241
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,400
Whoever talks first

242
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,400
loses the game.

243
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,560
And later,

244
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,920
we got used to such a way of communication.

245
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,080
It's quite enjoyable.

246
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,360
So this time,

247
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,160
he just wants me

248
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,360
to take care of this thing myself,

249
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,240
and then take you home.

250
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,080
Will you and Xiaofei

251
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,560
become such father and son?

252
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,680
To be honest,

253
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,080
I really don't know.

254
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,200
The road I'm going to take is in the army.

255
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:26,960
When I was a child,

256
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,080
I determined to become a soldier

257
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,920
and forever.

258
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,720
And I want to see

259
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,920
how far I can go as well.

260
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,080
I don't have the experience of being a dad at all.

261
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,160
I still need to learn.

262
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,320
You're good.

263
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,760
If Xiaofei can

264
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,240
be like you in the future,

265
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,920
I'll be satisfied.

266
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,680
And that's also what I'm worrying about.

267
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,730
People like me

268
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,240
are going to suffer a lot.

269
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,120
I don't want this to affect the kid.

270
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,440
Xiaofei and I,

271
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,550
are we holding you back?

272
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,630
Don't think that way.

273
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,810
Look,

274
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,200
Comrade Gu,

275
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,120
I know you're

276
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,480
good to me,

277
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,120
and I also understand that

278
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,720
I don't deserve you.

279
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,080
If it weren't for Fei boy,

280
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,320
we wouldn't have met.

281
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,950
We belong to two different worlds.

282
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,930
I didn't dare to expect

283
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,600
you to like me,

284
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,000
I only want to

285
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,650
repay your kindness.

286
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,550
I'll be nice to you,

287
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,280
and I want to do this as well.

288
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,800
I'll treat you well more than you think,

289
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,120
a lot more.

290
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,280
Don't worry.

291
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,280
If you get tired one day,

292
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,960
Xiaofei and I will leave immediately

293
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,760
and won't be a burden for you.

294
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,040
Are you done?

295
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,280
I can see why you feel anxious,

296
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:06,000
but I think you don't understand

297
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,890
why I want to be with you.

298
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,500
You said that I was comforting you,

299
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,130
but have you thought that

300
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:15,670
you're the one who's comforting me?

301
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,730
How's that possible?

302
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,020
I'll tell you one thing,

303
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,619
but you have to promise

304
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:28,820
you won't get mad.

305
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,300
You might have heard of it

306
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,420
that I was in a relationship with Nanzheng

307
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,380
when I first came to the army.

308
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,380
You two are such a good match.

309
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,580
I felt the same

310
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,260
at first.

311
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,780
But after a few years,

312
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,620
I started to think that I was wrong.

313
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,660
I was asked to be

314
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,460
a tough person when I was a kid.

315
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,980
I was fascinated by

316
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,100
the distant world that

317
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,060
could not be seen or touched.

318
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,460
I don't care about

319
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,620
the people around me.

320
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,460
I don't know how to take care of others.

321
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,260
And I thought Nanzheng was just like me

322
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,140
who only wants to go forward.

323
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,540
So we broke up.

324
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,980
But then I also wanted to change myself.

325
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,660
I want to be a person

326
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,420
who isn't just tough

327
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,420
and only thinks about

328
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,540
the distant world.

329
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,340
Then,

330
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,060
I met

331
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,220
you and Xiaofei.

332
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,260
Xiu,

333
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,740
I'm telling you the truth.

334
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,590
And I really think that

335
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,700
it's me that doesn't deserve you.

336
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,650
Don't talk about yourself like that.

337
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,860
You are a really good person.

338
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,060
Let me ask you a question.

339
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,100
Why do people get married?

340
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,180
They want to spend time with someone,

341
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,300
forever.

342
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,900
They want to spend time with someone,

343
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,020
forever.

344
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,220
It requires strong determination,

345
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,940
deep affection,

346
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,740
and big courage

347
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,380
to do it.

348
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,020
Xiu,

349
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,020
thank you and Xiaofei

350
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,700
for giving me a home.

351
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,050
Are you saying

352
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,850
we give you a home,

353
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,980
and you are going to hand you over to us?

354
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,420
A real home.

355
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,740
Besides Xiaofei,

356
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,220
I am the most important person to you.

357
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,450
Yiye,

358
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,810
I am afraid that I'm too clumsy

359
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,580
to give you a good life.

360
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,900
But I'll try my best.

361
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,300
I will try to

362
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,860
make our life better.

363
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,020
A real man

364
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,300
is fully capable of building his own family

365
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,700
and taking good care of it with his heart.

366
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,860
[Love]

367
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,540
How was that?

368
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,260
Great!

369
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:57,860
Go,

370
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,740
ask your dad to bring me some water.

371
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,860
Hope they're done talking now.

372
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,780
He is not my dad.

373
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,900
What are you talking about?

374
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,180
He didn't give you life, but he get to raise you.

375
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,260
If you want to be my nominal father,

376
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,420
I can think about it.

377
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,700
Thanks, but no.

378
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,860
I'd rather have my own son.

379
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,340
I'm telling you,

380
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,500
from now on,

381

as much as you love your mom, got it?

383
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,780
If you are naughty,

384
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,180
I'll beat you.

385
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,220
Got it?

386
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,740
Do you want to learn that move?

387
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,180
Yes.

388
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,230
Come here, try it.

389
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,340

Thank you all for coming.

I'm going to say something today.

400
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,660
I'm not

401
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:56,900

402
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,780
I want to

403
00:21:59,020 --> 00:21:59,940
say something to Xiu.

404
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,020
Xiu,

405
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,540
honestly, I feel quite ashamed.

406
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,460
It's a little bit late

407
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,300
for you to wear this bridal gown.

408
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,060
You had been waiting for

409
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,740
this day for five years.

410
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,500
Two years waiting for me

415

You've been always

417
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,100
But since today,

00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,940
you are my wife.

419
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,180
It's my responsibility

420
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,660

holding your hands in mine.

429
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:58,980
Maybe it's going to be hard,

430
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,860
but I'll treasure it.

431
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,220

00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,620
where's Gao? I haven't seen him today.

436
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:20,540
He's on his way.

437
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,900
I'm late.

438
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:27,660
It's okay.

439
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,500
You're in time.

440
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,420
The school is strict.

441
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,700
It is hard to ask for a leave.

[Zhangmu station]

443
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,500

a good dress up

445
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,500
and make her the most beautiful bride in the world.

446
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,540
What?

447
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:41,740
What about you?

448
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,420
Me?

449
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,940
When are you going to be my bride?

450
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,500
Stop kidding, we're running late.

451
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,260
Xiaofei,

452
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,460
you're eight today.

453
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,180
You can do arm wrestle with me now.

454
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,620
From today,

455
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,940
I'll take good care of you as my son,

456
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,580
and take the responsibility

457
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,060
a father should take.

458
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,860
I am not your son!

459
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,820
You are not my dad!

460
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,620
Xiaofei,

461
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,020
what are you talking about?

462
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,660
The Village Clerk told me that

463
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,180
my father was a combat hero.

464
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,860
He is the pride of the village.

465
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,460
My father is Zhang Fei.

466
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:23,620
Yes,

467
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,300
Xiaofei,

468
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,460
your father Zhang Fei

469
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,260
is our hero.

470
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,100
You should know it.

471
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:30,940
Where is he?

472
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,340
He sacrificed.

473
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,100

474
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,820
He's old enough to know the truth.

475

478
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:40,940
I'm not.

479
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,180

He is a hero.

484
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,060
He sacrificed himself

485
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,300
saving his mate,

486
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,220
and for people's peaceful life.

487
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,820
He is this country's hero,

488
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,380
and everyone's hero.

489
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,700

this is your dad's military medal.

493

504

has found the new happiness.

507
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,380
Dad Gu

508
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,460
loves your mom very much, too.

he's reborn,

512
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,740
and made a lot of people reborn, too.

513
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:15,820
Xiaofei,

514
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,180
after you got your new dad,

515
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,460
your dad Zhang Fei

516
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,760
would also be very happy.

and we love your dad and mom very much.

521
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,720
We are telling your dad Zhang Fei

522
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,180
in this way

523
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,260
that we live and die together,

524
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,780

tell us,

528
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,260
what's your name?

529
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,020
But,

530
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,540
I don't want to be Gu Xiaofei.

531
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,460
I want to be Zhang Xiaofei.

532
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,700
Then, Zhang Xiaofei it is.

533
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,060
It's a good name.

534
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,860
I'm Zhang Xiaofei.

535
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,140
“Zhang” is easier to write.

536
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,900
“Gu” has more strokes.

537
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,620
I don't want to be Gu Xiaofei.

Nanzheng,

609
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,580
I've been transferred to the Special Operation Battalion of the military district

610
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,460
for three months.

611
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,820
I learned

612
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,220
what the real savageness is,

613
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,180
and what real desperation is in this team.

614
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,140
We are aiming at

615
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,340

00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,100
can't be angels.

619
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,580
Almost every day, I wake up

620
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,100
grateful

621
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,300
for being alive.

622
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,340
I'm grateful that my arms and legs

623
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,220

624
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,380
I'm grateful that I didn't give up.

Then,

626
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,420
I think of you.

627
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,220
It warms my heart all the time.

628
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,420
No matter how hard or cold it is,

629
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,900
I can always pull through.

00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,700

632
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,220
the reason for that

633
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,860
is because I have you in my life.

634
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:18,580
Lower your head.

00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,460
Dear Gao Liang,

00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:27,140
your team is the blade of the troop.

637
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,780
It is the true man among the men.

638
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,020
Also,

639
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,140
I concern this kind of you deeply.

640
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,500
I can't imagine

641
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,140
what savageness and desperation you said about are,

642
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,540
but I know that

643
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,380
they must be impasses one after another.

644
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,500
I love you growing in impasses,

645
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,620
because that kind of growth

646
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,180
is the charm that solely belongs to men

647
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,380
and solely belongs to soldiers.

648
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,180
I like this hormonal feeling.

649
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,500
I think this kind of love

650
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,460
is the only one in this world.

651
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,580
This feeling

652
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,620
hurts

653
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,980
but also brings happiness.

654
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,060
It makes me feel that

655
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,140
even though we are apart,

656
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,940
our hearts

657
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,020

664
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,540
I'll make a toast to you.

665
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:41,660
Chief,

666
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,420
you are making me scared.

667
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,380
I've been with you for all these years,

668
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,340
and you didn't toast to me

669
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,380
when I got awarded in the war.

670
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,260
What's happening today?

671
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,740
You've been in the Special Operation Battalion for a year and a half, right?

672
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:52,700
Yes.

679
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,340
Thank you, Chief.

680
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,380
Fill in.

681
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,380
Your cooking is great.

682
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,580
It's been 10 years,

683
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,500
and your cooking hasn't gone rusty at all.

684
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:24,380
It hasn't changed, right?

685
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,179
I can't forget the skills of cooking for you.

686
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,219
Let me have a taste.

687
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:31,340
This Meng big nose,

688
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,580
where does he surpass me?

689
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:34,980
He's not as good as me for training soldiers.

690
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,900
He's not as good as me for fighting in wars.

691
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:39,580
But that guy has one thing better than me.

692
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,380
His three sons are all married.

693
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:44,860
And me?

694
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:46,020
Why is this?

696
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,940
when Zheng graduates,

697
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,060
we'll get married.

698
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,219
Stop bluffing.

699
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,100
Chief,

700
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,020
do you think

701
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:54,900
I can only

702
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:56,540
get gold medals on the training field?

703
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,620
Today,

704
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,780
I'm officially reporting to you.

705
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,620
Zheng and I,

706
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,340
our relationship,

707
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,220
has a rapid development

708
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,180
and deep growing.

709
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,660
Two letters a week.

710
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,060
She's thinking about me every day.

711
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,780
Did I agree to give my daughter to you?

712
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:14,500
Chief,

713
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,980
you encouraged me to do it before.

714
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,740
Why are you changing your mind

715
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:19,820
when I'm about to make it?

716
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:20,700
But,

717
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,740
why doesn't she tell me herself?

718
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,020
I have no information at all.

719
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,860
Does she still know I'm her dad?

720
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,580
Chief, you are not making any sense on this.

721
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,460
Zheng definitely didn't tell you

722
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,340
because she hasn't thought it through,

723
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,420
and she's not ready yet.

724
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,260
Zheng's your daughter,

725
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,180
don't you know her well?

726
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,660
Wait till she's ready.

727
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,980
When everything's all set,

728
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,420
she'll definitely tell you first.

729
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,980
That's more like it.

730
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,820
I'll tell you something.

731
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,460
The Artillery rapid reaction system experiment

732
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,620
of our district

733
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,940
had the first success.

734
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,540
Next, we need a breakthrough

735
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,340
on improving soldiers' and canons' coordination level.

736
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,580
To be frank,

737
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,060
that means when soldiers need

738
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:05,780
artillery support,

739
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,340
it can be ready whenever it is called.

740
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,300
About this,

741
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,220
Gu Yiye should be an expert.

742
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,900
He is called that

743
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,100
Armor Madman.

744
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:15,980
Let me finish.

745
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:18,460
The key here is the communication problem.

746
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,220
The headquarters prepared a plan,

747
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,700
trying to organize

748
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,020
a unified experiment contingent

749
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,620
to fully examine this system's

750
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:28,820
technology

751
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,300
and tactic performance.

752
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,940
They are planning on transferring a contingent

753
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,820
that has top training records from the Special Operation Battalion to corporate.

754
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,540
I think this mission

755
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,100
should be assigned to you.

756
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:41,940
Then how many days

757
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,380
will it take?

758
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,460
Days?

759
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,980
You won't be off the mission for less than 3 months.

760
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:47,940
That won't work.

761
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,020
Three months,

762
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,540
how will we catch up

763
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,580
what we miss on the training field?

764
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:54,660
Chief,

765
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,300
now every Special Operation Battalion in the army

766
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,980
is fixing their eyes on us like we are the target.

767
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,740
I'm telling you

768
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,580
Meng big nose's Army B

769
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,300
is working on this thing, too.

770
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,740
When the equipment is nearly set,

771
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:06,940
and the Army B gets a head start

772
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,300
in front of us Army A,

773
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,020
that's a big problem.

774
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,900
This is a great thing,

775
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:13,700
understand?

776
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:14,980
Chief,

777
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,180
I'm just

778
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,700
a small

779
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,540
cadre at battalion and company level.

780
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,500
I could barely manage the things in our squadron.

781
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,500
The things in the army

782
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,440
still need you to worry about.

783
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,380
Cut it out.

784
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,210
If you won't go, I'll dismiss you.

785
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:30,180
I really can't go.

786
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,230
The training comes first.

787
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,220
Are you nuts?

788
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,260
I forgot to tell you,

789
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,180
the deputy leader of the research group for that system

790
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:41,860
is Zheng.

791
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:44,820
Chief,

792
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,580
you

793
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,820
always told me

794
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,580
the collective interests are above

795
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,140
the individual interests.

796
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,580
I think this mission

797
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:53,860
has to be accomplished by me.

798
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:02,620
Report.

799
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:03,820
Come in.

800
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:05,780
Section Chief Zhao, come.

801
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,460
Sit.

802
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:08,900
Please.

803
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,900
Who's Shanwang One

804
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,620
examine group's leader?

805
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,500
The Deputy Section Chief Yang Ping from the Communication Section.

806
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,540
Communication Section is mainly responsible

807
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,460
for the developing and debugging the equipment,

808
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,180
and this mission

809
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,340
is focused mainly on

810
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,420
testing if the equipment is of use,

811
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,020
and of how much use

812
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:29,860
in the process of battle and training,

813
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,020
so, the keywords

814
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,700
are battle and training.

815
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,620
We should let

816
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,780
the training unit take charge.

817
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,540
Deputy Chief He,

818
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,740
what do you have in mind?

819
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,620
Let Xia Lin take charge.

820
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,660
He's from Regiment 720,

821
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,420
and is more familiar

822
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,260
with the situation there.

823
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,500
I don't think that's appropriate.

824
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,980
You still don't really

825
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,780
trust him?

826
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:57,700
Yes.

827
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,620
Since this mission is of great importance,

828
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,220
there's something

829
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,540
I have to make clear now.

830
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,540
I'm just talking about the business here.

831
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,420
Comrade Xia Lin,

832
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,660
his working style

833
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,740
is not really dependable to me.

834
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,100
When he was leading the grassroots troop,

835
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,100
he was always looking up to the leaders.

836
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,620
He cares too much about the benefits,

837
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,260
and he likes playing tricks.

838
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,700
That's why in the Red Arrow Exercise

839
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,140
he fell so hard.

840
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,740
I don't think it's a great idea

841
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:26,980
to hand him this important mission.

842
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:27,740
Chief Zhao,

843
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:28,940
you shouldn't use

844
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,900
the old vision to examine the problem.

845
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,020
As the old saying goes, a fall into the pit, a gain in your wit.

846
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,140
Don't you believe he can change?

847
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:37,900
He's the one.

848
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,780
That's settled.

849
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:43,740
Help.

850
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:44,580
Yes, sir.

851
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,740
Hurry up, hurry!

852
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,900
Welcome all the leaders to the Special Operation Battalion

853
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,100
to guide our work!

854
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:00,620
Welcome!

855
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:02,700
Welcome!

856
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:03,780
Welcome!

857
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,900
What kind of leaders are we?

858
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,780
The leader is beside me.

859
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,220
Leader, come on.

860
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,500
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

861
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,860
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

862
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:13,740
Welcome!

863
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,900
You must be exhausted.

864
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,500
Thank you so much.

865
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:21,820
Why is he here?

866
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:24,380
Be careful.

867
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,420
Captain Xia is really something.

868
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,780
I'm Captain Xia of the United Team.

869
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,380
Welcome, Captain Xia.

870
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,020
We sincerely welcome

871
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,140
the visiting of the United Team.

872
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,420
They are all experts and scholars.

873
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,100
Their visits are reasonable.

874
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,940
But Captain Xia, which unit are you in?

875
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,580
Who sent you here?

876
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,620
The army sent him here.

877
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,140
He's here on behalf of Army Headquarter.

878
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:57,700
Shut your mouth.

879
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:58,860
I said nothing wrong.

880
00:40:58,940 --> 00:40:59,940
I was telling the truth.

881
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,740
Dear leaders, welcome to guide our work!

882
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,420
Welcome!

883
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,460
Welcome!

884
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,860
Hello, Captain Xia. I'm Commissar Jiang Weixing.

885
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,780
Hurry up, unpack your stuff.

886
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,500
Honestly,

887
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:31,660
that guy

888
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,020
is indeed

889
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:33,820
arrogant.

890
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,940
He's on behalf of the Army Headquarter.

891
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,420
Our attitude to him

892
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,100
implies our attitude toward the higher-ups.

893
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,460
The Validation Team is in charge of technical problems.

894
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,020
Which unit is Xia Lin in?

895
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,260
He's coming with them.

896
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,180
How can he be helping?

897
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,340
Gao,

898
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:53,900
you're wrong.

899
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,180
It's empiricism.

900
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,140
Empiricism

901
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,020
is one of the great inventions of mankind.

902
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,500
It improves the efficiency

903
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,980
of interpersonal interactions greatly.

904
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,140
No matter what he did in the past,

905
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,420
he's the Captain now.

906
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:07,940
We need to respect that.

907
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,860
This is basic awareness.

908
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:11,980
Niu's right.

909
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,420
From now on,

910
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,180
in the name of

911
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,780
Party Branch Secretary of the Squadron,

912
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:17,420
I remind you

913
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,340
to stop being judgmental.

914
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,140
Do well and cooperate with them.

915
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,540
By the way, your girlfriend

916
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,660
is in our team.

917
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,820
Watch it and control

918
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:26,900
your own emotions.

919
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:27,860
Understand?

920
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,340
Are you being bossy to me?

921
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,740
What? You don't like it?

922
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,380
Why don't I give you a lesson on political theories?

923
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,780
I'll teach you a lesson.

924
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,260
I'll teach you a lesson on how to fight the war of annihilation,

925
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,900
and how to hit on

926
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,340
the Head Nurse Tong Bing in the General Hospital.

927
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:39,860
Get out!

928
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,180
Don't rub it in.

929
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,180
Wait.

930
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,100
Just tell me how to fight

931
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:47,540
the war of annihilation.

932
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:53,540
Chunyu.

933
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:56,100
Hi there.

934
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,020
Let's have a meeting

935
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,060
an hour later

936
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,500
to reschedule

937
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,100
the plan.
