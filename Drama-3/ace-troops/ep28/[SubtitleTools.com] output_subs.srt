EPISODE 8

3
00:00:21,952 --> 00:00:22,912
Hello?

4
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:25,164
Yes. And?

5
00:00:26,123 --> 00:00:28,542
What? What are you talking about?

6
00:00:30,127 --> 00:00:31,295
Eun Yeong-u?

7
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:34,799
How did that happen
to an administrative clerk?

8
00:00:45,226 --> 00:00:46,977
What? Where is he going?

9
00:00:52,525 --> 00:00:54,902
MYEONGDONG GENERAL STORE

10
00:01:04,995 --> 00:01:06,622
You're good at that.

11
00:01:06,705 --> 00:01:07,665
Of course.

12
00:01:15,798 --> 00:01:17,716
Are you here to pick up your clothes?

13
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,011
I thought you weren't coming today.

14
00:01:22,138 --> 00:01:24,265
I stopped by the Hosu University dorm.

15
00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:29,436
Why would you go there?
It must be quite chaotic there.

16
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,773
I figured they probably hadn't had
anything to eat, so I went

17
00:01:33,357 --> 00:01:34,358
to give them some food.

18
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,407
Could you step aside?

19
00:01:47,454 --> 00:01:49,456
Step aside?

20
00:02:03,846 --> 00:02:05,264
Or I will for you.

21
00:02:09,393 --> 00:02:11,896
Ma'am, this is bad.

22
00:02:12,813 --> 00:02:14,023
It's Yeong-u.

23
00:02:16,442 --> 00:02:17,610
What?

24
00:02:20,029 --> 00:02:21,322
My son is?

25
00:02:21,864 --> 00:02:22,740
Where's my husband?

26
00:02:23,324 --> 00:02:24,658
He's at the hospital.

27
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:27,870
That rude wench.

28
00:02:27,953 --> 00:02:30,748
Did she just leave without saying bye?

29
00:02:32,124 --> 00:02:33,542
I'm sorry, sir.

30
00:02:34,084 --> 00:02:36,128
I asked them to take
special care of your son,

31
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:38,214
so they assigned him
to somewhere far from HQ.

32
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:40,758
But I didn't know
they sent him to Udo Island.

33
00:02:43,677 --> 00:02:44,803
This way, sir.

34
00:02:47,681 --> 00:02:50,184
ARMED FORCES HOSPITAL

35
00:02:56,774 --> 00:02:58,067
Good work, guys.

36
00:03:04,365 --> 00:03:05,616
He's asleep, right?

37
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:07,076
We gave him a sedative.

38
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,084
Yeong-u.

39
00:03:16,293 --> 00:03:17,753
I shouldn't have let them

40
00:03:18,337 --> 00:03:20,089
assign you to the front lines.

41
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:29,515
Dad.

42
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:31,058
Hey.

43
00:03:33,185 --> 00:03:34,186
I…

44
00:03:36,146 --> 00:03:37,731
promised Mom…

45
00:03:39,108 --> 00:03:40,109
Mom?

46
00:03:42,444 --> 00:03:46,156
…that I would protect…

47
00:03:49,326 --> 00:03:53,998
That I would protect Yeong-ro.

48
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,667
<i>Mom.</i>

49
00:03:58,627 --> 00:04:00,421
I'll protect Yeong-ro.

50
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,673
So don't worry.

51
00:04:03,674 --> 00:04:05,718
I'll make sure she marries

52
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:07,970
someone who loves her so much.

53
00:04:08,846 --> 00:04:12,808
And I'll look out for her by her side
until she becomes an old lady,

54
00:04:13,392 --> 00:04:15,102
so don't worry about a thing, Mom.

55
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,314
I'm just three years younger than you.

56
00:04:27,614 --> 00:04:28,490
Dad.

57
00:04:29,408 --> 00:04:30,492
Yes?

58
00:04:32,786 --> 00:04:34,204
Yeong-ro…

59
00:04:40,878 --> 00:04:42,421
Keep her safe.

60
00:04:43,505 --> 00:04:44,923
Of course, I will.

61
00:04:45,507 --> 00:04:48,427
But you should get better
and do it yourself.

62
00:04:50,429 --> 00:04:51,764
You should do that.

63
00:04:56,101 --> 00:04:57,394
Yeong-u?

64
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,980
Don't fall asleep. Talk to me.

65
00:05:01,148 --> 00:05:02,399
Cardiac arrest!

66
00:05:02,483 --> 00:05:03,400
What's that sound?

67
00:05:03,484 --> 00:05:05,277
-Move aside!
-Move aside, sir.

68
00:05:05,361 --> 00:05:06,570
Do something!

69
00:05:07,446 --> 00:05:09,239
Yeong-u! Don't fall asleep.

70
00:05:09,323 --> 00:05:10,783
Don't fall asleep!

71
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:12,409
Yeong-u, wake up!

72
00:05:12,493 --> 00:05:13,911
Wake him up!

73
00:05:13,994 --> 00:05:15,496
Come on, do something!

74
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:16,789
Yeong-u, wake up!

75
00:05:17,498 --> 00:05:20,501
Wake him up!

76
00:05:21,668 --> 00:05:24,421
Don't fall asleep! Yeong-u!

77
00:05:32,054 --> 00:05:35,015
SECURITY CHECKPOINT, RESTRICTED

78
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:34,111
This is the Rhine.

79
00:08:35,112 --> 00:08:36,405
This is the Rhine.

80
00:08:36,488 --> 00:08:37,948
VIP, answer me.

81
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:43,370
<i>During the engagement
on the West Sea around 22:00 last night,</i>

82
00:08:43,453 --> 00:08:47,332
<i>Eun Yeong-u, the son of the ANSP director,
was injured and passed away.</i>

83
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:51,378
<i>It has been known that the person KIA
was corporate Kim Seong-hun,</i>

84
00:08:51,461 --> 00:08:54,631
<i>but it turned out
that it was marine Eun Yeong-u,</i>

85
00:08:54,715 --> 00:08:56,842
<i>the ANSP director's son, that died.</i>

86
00:08:56,925 --> 00:08:59,011
<i>What's more shocking is that Lim Soo-ho,</i>

87
00:08:59,094 --> 00:09:01,805
<i>the leader of the spies
who killed Eun Yeong-u,</i>

88
00:09:01,888 --> 00:09:05,809
<i>is holding the students hostage
in Hosu University dorm as we speak.</i>

89
00:09:05,892 --> 00:09:09,313
<i>He'd been acting secretly
all over East Germany,</i>

90
00:09:09,396 --> 00:09:12,691
<i>but he disguised himself as an economics
graduate student at Berlin University</i>

91
00:09:12,774 --> 00:09:14,610
<i>and came to Korea</i>

92
00:09:14,693 --> 00:09:17,362
<i>to approach Professor Han I-seop.</i>

93
00:09:17,654 --> 00:09:21,241
<i>This is the shocking truth revealed a day
after the engagement on the West Sea.</i>

94
00:09:21,325 --> 00:09:24,244
<i>We will update you
as soon as we find out more.</i>

95
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:45,432
What…

96
00:09:46,683 --> 00:09:48,185
What did she just say?

97
00:09:53,106 --> 00:09:54,399
My brother…

98
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,195
was killed?

99
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,250
My brother is dead?

100
00:10:22,469 --> 00:10:23,470
No…

101
00:10:26,973 --> 00:10:28,100
No…

102
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:29,810
No…

103
00:10:30,727 --> 00:10:32,479
It can't be true.

104
00:10:34,272 --> 00:10:36,942
Why… Why is my brother dead?

105
00:10:37,025 --> 00:10:37,984
No…

106
00:10:39,486 --> 00:10:40,737
That's not true…

107
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:47,953
Yeong-u… Yeong-u!

108
00:10:52,124 --> 00:10:54,126
Yeong-u… Yeong-u!

109
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:55,127
Eun Yeong-ro!

110
00:10:56,294 --> 00:10:57,129
Eun Yeong-ro!

111
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,508
-Yeong-ro!
-Yeong-u!

112
00:11:03,385 --> 00:11:06,388
Let go! Let go of me!

113
00:11:06,972 --> 00:11:08,056
Calm down!

114
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,768
I need to go see for myself!

115
00:11:15,355 --> 00:11:17,482
It's dangerous.
You don't want to die, do you?

116
00:11:45,677 --> 00:11:47,637
You're the leader of those
who killed Yeong-u?

117
00:11:48,805 --> 00:11:50,557
You evil bastard.

118
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,435
Holding us hostage wasn't enough?
Why did you kill my brother?

119
00:11:53,518 --> 00:11:55,187
What did he do wrong?

120
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,481
He didn't do anything to deserve it!

121
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:01,401
Bring him back.

122
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,904
Bring him back!

123
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:53,036
DORM ROOM 208

00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,205
DORM ROOM 205
DORM ROOM 204

00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:14,975
PRAYER ROOM

126
00:13:15,058 --> 00:13:16,059
2ND FLOOR LOUNGE

127
00:13:28,405 --> 00:13:30,240
<i>Don't worry, Hye-ryeong.</i>

128
00:13:30,323 --> 00:13:32,492
I checked that
the hall director wasn't in her office.

129
00:13:32,617 --> 00:13:34,911
<i>After roll-call, in room 207,</i>

130
00:13:34,995 --> 00:13:38,456
<i>Yeo Jeong-min, Ko Hye-ryeong,
Yoon Seol-hui, and Eun Yeong-ro</i>

131
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,626
<i>ate</i> ramyeon <i>and chat with Lee Jang-hui
from room 209</i>

132
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,129
<i>and Kim Gang-hui and Lim So-yeon
from room 206.</i>

133
00:13:44,212 --> 00:13:47,340
<i>Yeong-ro received a necklace as a gift
from an unnamed man who was</i>

134
00:13:47,424 --> 00:13:48,925
<i>her partner at the Open House.</i>

135
00:13:49,384 --> 00:13:50,969
<i>They must be seeing each other.</i>

136
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,346
The girl who treated me?

137
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:58,059
<i>I heard the ANSP director's son is dead.
What if they try to retaliate against us?</i>

138
00:14:03,565 --> 00:14:05,233
<i>Did you forget about the instructions?</i>

139
00:14:06,151 --> 00:14:08,695
But they were given before his death.

140
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,365
<i>I'm at Hosu University where
the armed spies are holding people hostage</i>

141
00:14:12,449 --> 00:14:15,285
<i>after escaping the ANSP surveillance.</i>

142
00:14:15,368 --> 00:14:17,162
<i>The university is closed to the public</i>

143
00:14:17,245 --> 00:14:20,498
<i>including its students, and the police
special forces have been sent in.</i>

144
00:14:20,582 --> 00:14:25,045
<i>ANSP has camped in front of the dorm
and taken control of the scene--</i>

145
00:14:28,173 --> 00:14:31,885
Set a booby trap on the cafeteria windows
and put an extra bomb.

146
00:14:32,969 --> 00:14:34,888
<i>A bomb?</i>

147
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,682
If they try to deceive us again,

148
00:14:40,268 --> 00:14:41,519
I'll push the button.

149
00:16:02,308 --> 00:16:04,853
Talk about bad timing.

150
00:16:05,562 --> 00:16:07,230
If only you'd come in a bit later.

151
00:16:08,773 --> 00:16:09,816
Turn around.

152
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:37,177
That…

153
00:16:37,844 --> 00:16:39,846
Why is that…

154
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:00,366
You know I have
a detonator in my pocket, right?

155
00:17:01,076 --> 00:17:02,994
Don't try anything funny.

156
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,330
Will you blow everyone up?

157
00:17:06,414 --> 00:17:09,834
You know Lee Seong-jo, right? The one
who came to assassinate the president.

158
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:14,172
He fell in love with someone in the South
and is living happily.

159
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:19,427
Don't you want to live here
with someone you love, like him?

160
00:17:25,391 --> 00:17:28,269
If you want to live happily
with that woman, don't do anything stupid.

161
00:17:29,104 --> 00:17:30,313
I won't let it slide twice.

162
00:17:31,815 --> 00:17:33,942
"That woman"? Who?

163
00:17:35,276 --> 00:17:39,906
Oh, her? She's just
one of my subordinates. Nothing more.

164
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,450
Just colleagues.

165
00:17:58,174 --> 00:17:59,259
Go in.

166
00:18:27,495 --> 00:18:28,705
How is she?

167
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:31,124
I gave her a tranquilizer,

168
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:33,793
so she'll be fine after some sleep.

169
00:18:46,014 --> 00:18:47,724
Can we have a word for a minute?

170
00:19:11,873 --> 00:19:13,750
I know the North and the South
made a deal,

171
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,501
but we never know

172
00:19:16,044 --> 00:19:18,379
how things will turn out and when.

173
00:19:20,048 --> 00:19:21,299
You know that, right?

174
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:23,801
Of course, ma'am.

175
00:19:23,885 --> 00:19:25,678
So the ANSP director's daughter…

176
00:19:28,806 --> 00:19:31,100
hid you in this dorm?

177
00:19:32,727 --> 00:19:33,770
Yes.

178
00:19:37,482 --> 00:19:41,194
Since you're indebted to her, it must
be bothering you. I understand that.

179
00:19:43,404 --> 00:19:47,116
But don't let
your personal feelings ruin our mission.

180
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,665
I never had any personal feelings for her.

181
00:19:56,751 --> 00:19:58,378
I'm relieved to hear that.

182
00:20:08,388 --> 00:20:11,182
The hostage situation
hadn't been in the news all this time,

183
00:20:11,266 --> 00:20:13,142
but the news about it just broke out.

184
00:20:13,601 --> 00:20:15,311
And my face has been disclosed.

185
00:20:16,437 --> 00:20:20,108
Will we really be able
to go back alive in ten days?

186
00:20:22,986 --> 00:20:24,237
Comrade Lim Soo-ho.

187
00:20:25,571 --> 00:20:28,241
Are you worried about that
or doubting the party?

188
00:20:28,324 --> 00:20:30,451
I'm not doubting the party's orders.

189
00:20:31,202 --> 00:20:32,996
I just don't trust the ANSP.

190
00:20:33,579 --> 00:20:34,831
As I told you,

191
00:20:35,873 --> 00:20:38,793
last time we followed
the instructions and went out there,

192
00:20:38,876 --> 00:20:41,337
they sprayed us with bullets to kill us.

193
00:20:43,631 --> 00:20:47,093
If what you're saying is true, it means
they stabbed the party in the back.

194
00:20:47,176 --> 00:20:48,970
Would the party really have

195
00:20:49,762 --> 00:20:52,181
negotiated with such backstabbers again?

196
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,476
Then…

197
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,855
let me ask you one thing.

198
00:21:04,569 --> 00:21:06,070
Why in ten days?

199
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,990
You seriously don't know?

200
00:21:09,866 --> 00:21:13,494
A veteran spy like you who's been
acting in covert all over Germany?

201
00:21:53,034 --> 00:21:54,160
That's a bomb, isn't it?

202
00:21:54,744 --> 00:21:58,873
They said they'd release more of us,
but aren't they going to just kill us all?

203
00:21:58,956 --> 00:22:01,292
There you go again.
Don't jump to conclusions.

204
00:22:01,876 --> 00:22:04,337
They wouldn't dare.
The army is surrounding this place.

205
00:22:06,422 --> 00:22:09,175
Wait. Where's Yeong-ro?

206
00:22:09,258 --> 00:22:11,677
What if they took only her somewhere safe?

207
00:22:12,178 --> 00:22:13,096
Keep it down.

208
00:22:13,179 --> 00:22:16,182
He took her out of here in secret.

209
00:22:16,766 --> 00:22:18,309
Stop talking nonsense.

210
00:22:20,353 --> 00:22:21,479
Get back to sleep.

211
00:22:21,854 --> 00:22:24,565
Even when they tried
to kill the doctor by the window,

212
00:22:24,649 --> 00:22:27,193
he desperately tried
to save Yeong-ro first.

213
00:22:27,276 --> 00:22:28,611
I saw it with my own eyes!

214
00:22:28,694 --> 00:22:29,821
Gye Bun-ok.

215
00:22:31,739 --> 00:22:33,699
I bet even if all of us here are killed,

216
00:22:33,783 --> 00:22:35,993
he'll still try to save Yeong-ro.

217
00:22:37,161 --> 00:22:38,579
It's already been two hours.

218
00:22:39,664 --> 00:22:41,165
They must've released her. Right?

219
00:22:41,249 --> 00:22:42,375
Of course not.

220
00:22:45,378 --> 00:22:46,879
She passed out.

221
00:22:47,547 --> 00:22:51,217
After hearing that her brother died during
an engagement with a Northern spy boat.

222
00:22:52,176 --> 00:22:53,636
Her brother died?

223
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:55,513
I feel so bad for her.

224
00:22:55,596 --> 00:22:58,266
-Oh, no.
-Poor Yeong-ro.

225
00:23:10,194 --> 00:23:11,112
Honey.

226
00:23:11,195 --> 00:23:14,115
What are you doing here?
The guests are coming.

227
00:23:15,616 --> 00:23:17,118
It's all my fault.

228
00:23:18,202 --> 00:23:20,496
I'm the one who got him killed.

229
00:23:22,707 --> 00:23:24,959
That's not your fault.

230
00:23:25,543 --> 00:23:27,879
When you sent him to the front lines,

231
00:23:27,962 --> 00:23:31,757
you were in a crisis because of the Campus
Stabilization Act. You had no choice.

232
00:23:32,467 --> 00:23:34,802
On top of that, he protested
against the government.

233
00:23:34,886 --> 00:23:36,971
Very enthusiastically, at that.

234
00:23:37,054 --> 00:23:40,558
I was so worried
that you might get on Code 1's bad side.

235
00:23:43,978 --> 00:23:44,896
Honey.

236
00:23:46,063 --> 00:23:48,483
I know it's really hard for you,

237
00:23:48,566 --> 00:23:52,236
but our Yeong-u
bravely sacrificed his life

238
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,407
for our country and people while
fighting against spies from the North.

239
00:23:58,117 --> 00:24:00,328
If only it weren't for Operation Phoenix…

240
00:24:02,455 --> 00:24:03,623
If Code 1 finds out

241
00:24:03,706 --> 00:24:06,334
you blame the operation for it,
you'll be doomed!

242
00:24:06,792 --> 00:24:08,920
Now that the operation has failed,

243
00:24:09,504 --> 00:24:11,005
if you're pushed out,

244
00:24:11,088 --> 00:24:12,215
what about Yeong-ro?

245
00:24:12,298 --> 00:24:14,425
We can't bring Yeong-u back,

246
00:24:14,509 --> 00:24:16,719
but we must save Yeong-ro at all cost!

247
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,347
I know you made a deal with the North,

248
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:23,851
as long as she's in the hands of
those brutal spies, she can never be safe.

249
00:24:24,435 --> 00:24:26,229
Honey!

250
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,774
You must pull yourself together!

251
00:24:30,441 --> 00:24:32,985
I know. I know that.

252
00:24:33,778 --> 00:24:34,987
Yeong-u…

253
00:24:35,363 --> 00:24:36,864
Yeong-u…

254
00:24:40,952 --> 00:24:42,703
<i>And I'll look out for her</i>

255
00:24:43,204 --> 00:24:45,623
by her side until she becomes an old lady,

256
00:24:46,832 --> 00:24:49,085
so don't worry about a thing, Mom.

257
00:24:49,168 --> 00:24:51,170
I'm just three years younger than you.

258
00:24:59,262 --> 00:25:00,471
Yeong-u!

259
00:25:04,058 --> 00:25:05,184
Yeong-u!

260
00:25:07,562 --> 00:25:08,521
Yeong-u!

261
00:25:11,482 --> 00:25:12,483
Yeong-u…

262
00:25:14,777 --> 00:25:15,987
Yeong-u!

263
00:25:20,324 --> 00:25:21,951
Yeong-u…

264
00:25:22,702 --> 00:25:24,704
Get it together.

265
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:27,957
My brother

266
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:29,917
is gone.

267
00:25:32,336 --> 00:25:34,005
You must've had a nightmare.

268
00:25:34,797 --> 00:25:35,881
Don't you remember

269
00:25:36,465 --> 00:25:37,550
passing out?

270
00:25:55,318 --> 00:25:57,028
It's all right.

271
00:25:57,194 --> 00:25:58,029
It's okay.

272
00:25:58,613 --> 00:26:01,198
All right, breathe in again.

273
00:26:04,577 --> 00:26:05,911
It's okay.

274
00:26:11,917 --> 00:26:13,210
<i>Wait.</i>

275
00:26:14,503 --> 00:26:19,091
Can you give me that necklace?
No, can you sell it to me?

276
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:28,768
I'm sorry,

277
00:26:29,852 --> 00:26:33,898
but it's more precious
than my own life to me.

278
00:26:38,694 --> 00:26:40,488
They must be mistaken.

279
00:26:40,571 --> 00:26:42,698
Maybe someone by the same name.

280
00:27:31,831 --> 00:27:33,666
<i>The late Eun Yeong-u, the Marine</i>

281
00:27:33,749 --> 00:27:37,086
<i>who sacrificed his life to kill our
enemies during the life-and-death battle.</i>

282
00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:39,088
<i>The last thing he did while alive</i>

283
00:27:39,171 --> 00:27:43,050
<i>was write a letter
to his one and only younger sister.</i>

284
00:27:43,134 --> 00:27:46,512
<i>He was going to finish writing it
after the patrol,</i>

285
00:27:46,637 --> 00:27:50,599
<i>but the blank space
will never be filled now.</i>

286
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,019
<i>I'm Yoo Young-jun, MBS.</i>

287
00:28:21,922 --> 00:28:23,257
Go back to the room.

288
00:28:29,513 --> 00:28:31,056
Go back to the room.

289
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,018
Let me go.

290
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:39,857
Let me out.

291
00:28:47,198 --> 00:28:48,491
My brother…

292
00:28:52,536 --> 00:28:54,205
I want to go see my brother.

293
00:28:59,043 --> 00:29:00,044
Please.

294
00:29:00,795 --> 00:29:02,922
Please let me see him one last time.

295
00:29:41,168 --> 00:29:42,169
Thank you.

296
00:29:42,253 --> 00:29:43,754
What? Okay.

297
00:29:47,341 --> 00:29:51,011
I can't imagine how devastated
you must be to have lost your child.

298
00:29:51,595 --> 00:29:54,348
But his sacrifice won't be in vain.

299
00:30:01,647 --> 00:30:02,481
Be strong.

300
00:30:04,358 --> 00:30:08,988
Mr. Park, you don't need to worry
about the Han I-sep abduction case.

301
00:30:09,989 --> 00:30:13,409
We've broken the hostage situation
in the news to take care of it neatly--

302
00:30:13,492 --> 00:30:16,036
Stop. How could you be so inconsiderate?

303
00:30:17,162 --> 00:30:19,582
They just lost their child.

304
00:30:25,004 --> 00:30:26,213
Right.

305
00:30:26,547 --> 00:30:30,092
I heard your daughter
is being held at Hosu University.

306
00:30:32,887 --> 00:30:34,096
Yes,

307
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:37,433
I just found out
that Yeong-ro is one of the hostages.

308
00:30:37,516 --> 00:30:41,812
He's just so worried about our country
even when his children are in danger.

309
00:30:41,896 --> 00:30:43,022
-Stop it.
-It's just…

310
00:30:43,606 --> 00:30:47,651
I'm sure the people will appreciate
your true patriotism someday.

311
00:30:48,903 --> 00:30:49,904
Stay strong.

312
00:31:01,332 --> 00:31:02,333
Let's go.

313
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,799
I can't believe you!

314
00:31:10,883 --> 00:31:11,884
I just…

315
00:31:15,846 --> 00:31:17,222
I mean,

316
00:31:17,306 --> 00:31:21,769
since when were
Mr. Park and Eun that close?

317
00:31:22,478 --> 00:31:24,813
If Mr. Park is to be elected president,

318
00:31:25,606 --> 00:31:27,483
you'll end up as a fifth wheel.

319
00:31:27,566 --> 00:31:28,734
That's enough!

320
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:31,862
What do you even know? Don't jinx it.

321
00:31:31,946 --> 00:31:32,947
I mean,

322
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:37,618
he used to treat Eun like a nobody
until recently. What's changed?

323
00:31:37,701 --> 00:31:38,994
What a sly snake.

324
00:31:39,495 --> 00:31:42,915
He's after sympathy votes
he might get thanks to Eun.

325
00:31:43,374 --> 00:31:47,544
If the Han I-seop case broke out without
any counterplan, he would've chewed me up!

326
00:31:49,296 --> 00:31:50,339
Wait.

327
00:31:51,131 --> 00:31:54,343
So there's a counterplan
to bury the Professor Han scandal?

328
00:32:01,058 --> 00:32:02,267
What do I do with you?

329
00:32:04,228 --> 00:32:06,480
Eun's wife caught on quick.

330
00:32:06,563 --> 00:32:08,440
You seriously don't know?

331
00:32:09,024 --> 00:32:10,943
What other than the hostage situation?

332
00:32:13,737 --> 00:32:15,531
You'll use the hostage-taking?

333
00:32:17,116 --> 00:32:19,868
But what if something
happens to the students?

334
00:32:19,952 --> 00:32:20,869
Do you think--

335
00:32:21,495 --> 00:32:24,081
That's not important right now!

336
00:32:24,164 --> 00:32:28,585
Look how well the former actress is
supporting her husband. What about you?

337
00:32:29,169 --> 00:32:32,464
All you do is act
like the leader among some ladies.

338
00:32:33,924 --> 00:32:34,925
My goodness.

339
00:32:38,929 --> 00:32:40,014
Honey.

340
00:32:44,018 --> 00:32:46,311
Don't worry about a thing.

341
00:32:47,604 --> 00:32:50,649
No matter what Ms. Hong does,

342
00:32:50,733 --> 00:32:53,027
unless 13 people die,

343
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,779
it'll be all for nothing.

344
00:33:00,325 --> 00:33:02,077
What are you talking about?

345
00:33:05,539 --> 00:33:09,209
For Eun to become president,

346
00:33:09,293 --> 00:33:13,672
13 young virgins must die
according to the fortuneteller!

347
00:33:13,756 --> 00:33:16,633
Again? You went to see
a fortuneteller again?

348
00:33:16,717 --> 00:33:19,720
He's not just any fortuneteller.

349
00:33:20,304 --> 00:33:24,308
Even when you agonized
over whether to join the coup,

350
00:33:24,391 --> 00:33:28,645
he's the one who told me you should
take out the commander and join it!

351
00:33:28,729 --> 00:33:31,774
Are you a birdbrain? Are you?

352
00:33:31,857 --> 00:33:33,609
I told you never to talk about it!

353
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:36,487
How many times must I tell you?

354
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,739
Right.

355
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:40,783
Gosh.

356
00:33:43,035 --> 00:33:45,120
I'm sorry, honey.

357
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,083
I forgot.

358
00:33:53,253 --> 00:33:55,047
You must want to screw me over.

359
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,840
There's no other explanation.

360
00:33:56,924 --> 00:33:58,258
God damn it!

361
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:04,181
Darn it.

362
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:06,475
That little sly minx.

363
00:34:12,356 --> 00:34:14,942
Mr. An. Can't you see what I mean?

364
00:34:15,025 --> 00:34:18,987
I know the fact that he died
during the engagement is important,

365
00:34:19,071 --> 00:34:22,157
but the fact that the director
sent his own son to the front lines…

366
00:34:22,533 --> 00:34:23,534
No!

367
00:34:24,993 --> 00:34:27,329
You should leave out the protesting part.

368
00:34:28,163 --> 00:34:31,083
People need to know
he sent his son to the front lines

369
00:34:31,166 --> 00:34:33,961
so that they'll be
impressed by his patriotism.

370
00:34:34,586 --> 00:34:35,963
I understand, ma'am.

371
00:34:36,964 --> 00:34:41,009
Mr. Eun will make a great
presidential candidate in the future.

372
00:34:41,093 --> 00:34:43,637
<i>And I'll make sure people
will remember that.</i>

373
00:34:44,888 --> 00:34:48,600
By the way, I should go there
to pay my respects to him.

374
00:34:48,684 --> 00:34:51,436
You just focus on preparing
for tomorrow's announcement.

375
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,731
Don't worry. We're even rehearsing it.

376
00:34:55,023 --> 00:34:55,983
Salute!

377
00:35:02,281 --> 00:35:03,365
Where were we?

378
00:35:09,163 --> 00:35:10,289
<i>Let's continue.</i>

379
00:35:12,249 --> 00:35:13,584
I'm Gal Sang-sik from JBC.

380
00:35:15,335 --> 00:35:16,253
Thank you.

381
00:35:17,004 --> 00:35:19,965
The ANSP announced that Han was killed
while defecting to the North.

382
00:35:20,549 --> 00:35:23,218
Why are you trying
to frame the best brains

383
00:35:23,302 --> 00:35:25,679
of the opposition candidate for it?

384
00:35:26,597 --> 00:35:28,140
I told you.

385
00:35:30,392 --> 00:35:32,144
In Professor Han's bag,

386
00:35:32,227 --> 00:35:35,272
we found a letter
from his son in the North

387
00:35:35,355 --> 00:35:37,316
that says they should destroy

388
00:35:37,399 --> 00:35:39,109
the pro-US candidate--

389
00:35:39,193 --> 00:35:40,068
No!

390
00:35:41,111 --> 00:35:43,488
You can't get so worked up.

391
00:35:43,572 --> 00:35:44,823
Right.

392
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:47,201
I should relax.

393
00:35:47,284 --> 00:35:48,243
Let me try it again.

394
00:35:48,327 --> 00:35:50,078
Are you going to do this all night?

395
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,831
Look.

396
00:35:52,915 --> 00:35:56,335
It's going to be live. It'll be
broadcast live all over the country!

397
00:35:56,418 --> 00:35:59,463
It's my chance
to become popular nationwide.

398
00:35:59,546 --> 00:36:01,298
Of course, it must go perfectly!

399
00:36:04,176 --> 00:36:05,177
Guys.

400
00:36:08,013 --> 00:36:09,848
What should I wear tomorrow?

401
00:36:10,224 --> 00:36:11,099
Pardon?

402
00:36:35,749 --> 00:36:37,376
YOON SEOL-HUI, EUN YEONG-RO
YEO JEONG-MIN, KO HYE-RYEONG

403
00:38:35,202 --> 00:38:38,080

CAFETERIA

407
00:38:55,555 --> 00:38:57,432
Take your time and eat little by little.

408
00:38:58,433 --> 00:38:59,434
Here.

409
00:39:21,331 --> 00:39:23,333
Yeong-ro, you should eat.

410
00:39:27,921 --> 00:39:29,464
Or you'll collapse.

411
00:39:37,806 --> 00:39:40,934
I think he should be untied to eat this.

412
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,940
-Untie him.
-Okay.

413
00:39:47,858 --> 00:39:48,775
Come on.

414
00:39:52,362 --> 00:39:54,739
Hey, come eat.

415
00:39:54,823 --> 00:39:56,199
What are you doing?

416
00:39:56,283 --> 00:39:58,910
-Eat? What…
-I saved some for you.

417
00:39:59,786 --> 00:40:01,329
Try anything funny, and I'll kill you.

418
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:07,294
This is for you. Come on.

419
00:40:07,377 --> 00:40:09,463
-You get out of here.
-Come on.

420
00:40:13,341 --> 00:40:15,051
-Sir.
-Yes?

421
00:40:16,553 --> 00:40:17,762
Why don't you eat with me?

422
00:40:48,126 --> 00:40:49,628
Did you sleep at all?

423
00:40:49,711 --> 00:40:52,756
I don't even know
if I did for the past two days.

424
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,553
Your face has become
such a mess in two days.

425
00:41:01,765 --> 00:41:03,683
If I'd searched more thoroughly,

426
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,269
this wouldn't be happening.

427
00:41:06,561 --> 00:41:10,023
They were determined to hide him,
so you wouldn't have found him.

428
00:41:10,106 --> 00:41:11,149
Stop it.

429
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,492
I know the hall director is
a stickler for the rules,

430
00:41:21,576 --> 00:41:23,453
but I still don't get why

431
00:41:23,537 --> 00:41:25,622
she stopped us from searching like that.

432
00:41:27,374 --> 00:41:28,375
I found that weird too.

433
00:41:29,125 --> 00:41:32,712
A man who'd been shot came to hide
in the dorm. A spy, at that.

434
00:41:33,463 --> 00:41:34,756
What if he harmed the kids?

435
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,509
She should've been scared
and let you search.

436
00:41:40,011 --> 00:41:42,180
There are so many
suspicious things about her.

437
00:41:46,601 --> 00:41:48,019
There are many?

438
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,648
Yes. Once a month,

439
00:41:52,315 --> 00:41:55,193
-without anyone knowing, she went to--
-Hey, you.

440
00:41:55,277 --> 00:41:57,362
Stop talking nonsense.

441
00:41:57,445 --> 00:41:58,363
Just eat.

442
00:41:58,446 --> 00:42:00,907
You said you found it suspicious too.

443
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:03,493
Suspicious?

444
00:42:05,245 --> 00:42:06,454
Maybe she has no family.

445
00:42:06,538 --> 00:42:08,748
She's cooped up in the dorm
even during holidays.

446
00:42:08,832 --> 00:42:10,375
But once a month,

447
00:42:11,209 --> 00:42:15,922
she goes out at dawn and comes back
all exhausted right before roll-call.

448
00:42:25,682 --> 00:42:27,350
<i>All exhausted?</i>

449
00:42:27,934 --> 00:42:29,978
Yes. That's not all.

450
00:42:30,562 --> 00:42:33,565
And it was really strange
when she took the job in the dorm.

451
00:42:33,648 --> 00:42:34,899
Hey, now.

452
00:42:34,983 --> 00:42:36,276
Shut it.

453
00:42:36,359 --> 00:42:39,321
I overheard what you told Ms. Oh.

454
00:42:40,155 --> 00:42:42,115
What on earth did you overhear?

455
00:42:46,328 --> 00:42:49,080
The day before Ms. Song died, she saw

456
00:42:50,665 --> 00:42:51,833
Ms. Pi's picture.

457
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:53,501
Picture?

458
00:42:56,254 --> 00:43:00,634
No, it wasn't a picture.
What was it? It was…

459
00:43:06,056 --> 00:43:07,724
Put him on right now!

460
00:43:07,807 --> 00:43:09,851
Don't you know who I am?

461
00:43:09,934 --> 00:43:11,519
I'm still the hall director!

462
00:43:16,358 --> 00:43:17,233
Sir.

463
00:43:18,777 --> 00:43:22,447
I may be quitting for personal reasons,

464
00:43:23,031 --> 00:43:27,327
but I've been working
as hall director in this dorm

465
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:29,704
for 11 years, 5 months, and 12 days.

466
00:43:30,705 --> 00:43:32,832
Can just anyone be in this position?

467
00:43:34,209 --> 00:43:37,504
If you hire such a woman as hall director,
you'll be insulting me

468
00:43:37,587 --> 00:43:40,006
and tarnishing
Hosu University's history and tradition!

469
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:43,635
You'll also be
threatening the students' safety!

470
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,810
You think I haven't done
the reference check?

471
00:43:52,394 --> 00:43:54,938
My cousin lives in Munich.

472
00:43:56,272 --> 00:43:57,691
<i>My goodness.</i>

473
00:43:57,774 --> 00:44:01,945
<i>Her eyes are so big that she looks scary.</i>

474
00:44:02,612 --> 00:44:06,074
<i>Thinking that,
I was looking at her picture.</i>

475
00:44:06,157 --> 00:44:08,785
She's not good enough to be my successor.

476
00:44:13,289 --> 00:44:15,041
I'm quitting, but I care.

477
00:44:16,292 --> 00:44:18,962
Who the hell asked you to do this?

478
00:44:20,213 --> 00:44:23,091
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

479
00:44:23,883 --> 00:44:26,970
She'll be the next hall director
over my dead body!

480
00:44:27,053 --> 00:44:28,346
Do you understand?

481
00:44:30,598 --> 00:44:31,599
Ma'am.

482
00:44:40,525 --> 00:44:42,110
<i>And that night,</i>

483
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,697
<i>Ms. Song killed herself.</i>

484
00:44:48,533 --> 00:44:50,034
Killed herself?

485
00:44:50,827 --> 00:44:51,745
Why?

486
00:44:51,828 --> 00:44:53,913
How would I know?

487
00:44:53,997 --> 00:44:57,459
She was about to quit
because she'd been quite ill.

488
00:44:57,542 --> 00:45:00,211
So I just thought
she didn't want to live anymore.

489
00:45:00,295 --> 00:45:01,963
But why did she

490
00:45:02,046 --> 00:45:05,467
oppose hiring Ms. Pi
as hall director like that?

491
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:09,220
I mean, Ms. Pi graduated from
Hosu University and studied in Germany.

492
00:45:09,304 --> 00:45:10,764
I don't know.

493
00:45:10,847 --> 00:45:13,391
How would we ever know
what the high-ups think?

494
00:45:14,225 --> 00:45:15,810
Anyway,

495
00:45:15,894 --> 00:45:19,272
when I went to see
the new hall director afterward,

496
00:45:20,231 --> 00:45:24,986
it turned out to be
the woman with big eyes.

497
00:45:42,921 --> 00:45:47,425
COLT 25 POCKET PISTOL
LIGHTER, RADIO

498
00:45:52,555 --> 00:45:53,473
Hey.

499
00:45:54,057 --> 00:45:55,183
Yes?

500
00:45:55,266 --> 00:45:56,935
Showing off your drawing skills?

501
00:45:57,519 --> 00:45:58,436
Is that it?

502
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,021
Darn it.

503
00:46:01,105 --> 00:46:02,857
Add a scar or something.

504
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,235
Right here.

505
00:46:05,902 --> 00:46:07,028
A scar? What for?

506
00:46:15,745 --> 00:46:19,415
You drew him well. It's very similar.

507
00:46:19,499 --> 00:46:20,542
Thank you.

508
00:46:21,334 --> 00:46:23,002
We're not using it to catch him.

509
00:46:23,086 --> 00:46:25,088
It's for promoting
a sense of national security.

510
00:46:25,171 --> 00:46:27,423
Yes, and Lim Soo-ho looks too pretty.

511
00:46:27,507 --> 00:46:29,592
We need the other guys to look scary

512
00:46:30,176 --> 00:46:32,053
to make them look like bad guys.

513
00:46:37,141 --> 00:46:38,309
What's that?

514
00:46:38,977 --> 00:46:42,856
We added them in. People can't think
we're failing to catch only three guys.

515
00:46:42,939 --> 00:46:46,109
Lim Soo-ho and the six spies.
Seven in total.

516
00:46:46,776 --> 00:46:47,861
That's right.

ANNOUNCEMENT ON INVESTIGATION
OF HOSU UNIV. HOSTAGE SITUATION

518
00:46:57,161 --> 00:46:58,162
<i>Lim Soo-ho</i>

519
00:46:58,246 --> 00:47:02,375
went to the Hosu University dorm
to hide with lethal…

520
00:47:02,876 --> 00:47:06,087
Lethal.

521
00:47:06,671 --> 00:47:07,839
Lethal.

522
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:13,344
You don't even knock now?

523
00:47:19,225 --> 00:47:21,269
Aren't you worried about the students?

524
00:47:21,352 --> 00:47:24,522
Do you expect them to be safe
after provoking the spies like this?

525
00:47:25,106 --> 00:47:27,734
I'm telling you,
he was holding the detonator!

526
00:47:27,817 --> 00:47:29,444
If he pushes it, everyone will die!

527
00:47:31,487 --> 00:47:32,572
Han-na.

528
00:47:33,573 --> 00:47:35,950
Don't go against the flow.

529
00:47:36,534 --> 00:47:38,202
We do what we're told

530
00:47:38,912 --> 00:47:41,039
without question. Absolute obedience.

531
00:47:42,957 --> 00:47:43,917
The detonator?

532
00:47:45,585 --> 00:47:47,337
The director's daughter is in there.

533
00:47:47,921 --> 00:47:50,256
You think he'd do
something that might kill her?

534
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,509
What do you mean?

535
00:47:53,593 --> 00:47:55,511
It's better for you not to know.

536
00:47:56,012 --> 00:47:57,805
What you don't know won't hurt you.

537
00:47:58,598 --> 00:47:59,724
Stop bothering me.

538
00:48:01,935 --> 00:48:03,728
Lethal.

539
00:48:05,605 --> 00:48:06,648
He's here again.

540
00:48:09,859 --> 00:48:12,362
Gal, that bastard. How dare he come here?

541
00:48:13,112 --> 00:48:14,405
That bastard.

542
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:19,827
He's here!

543
00:48:27,794 --> 00:48:30,922
I'm An Gyeong-hui,
Chief of Anti-communist Investigations.

544
00:48:31,881 --> 00:48:33,299
Before the announcement,

545
00:48:33,383 --> 00:48:35,927
I pray for the souls of

546
00:48:36,427 --> 00:48:38,304
the late Eun Yeong-u,

547
00:48:38,388 --> 00:48:40,515
the son of director Eun,

548
00:48:40,598 --> 00:48:43,643
and the late Marine Kim Yeong-jun.

549
00:48:43,726 --> 00:48:47,772
And I also offer my sincere condolences
to the bereaved families.

550
00:48:54,112 --> 00:48:55,113
Now,

551
00:48:55,947 --> 00:48:59,158
I'll explain how the investigation
for the hostage situation is going.

552
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:04,872
Lim Soo-ho disguised himself as
an economics student at Berlin University

553
00:49:05,415 --> 00:49:06,874
came to Korea early this year.

554
00:49:07,291 --> 00:49:08,626
The ANSP

555
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:12,463
started to try to find out
his whereabouts, suspecting he was

556
00:49:12,547 --> 00:49:16,175
Taedong River 1
who'd been acting in Germany.

557
00:49:16,676 --> 00:49:20,930
We had our agents tail him
and keep a close eye on him.

558
00:49:21,472 --> 00:49:26,811
Finally, we saw Professor Han I-seop
secretly meeting Lim Soo-ho.

559
00:49:27,145 --> 00:49:29,731
So we started chasing those two.

560
00:49:34,444 --> 00:49:38,114
A case without hard evidence
but with circumstantial one.

561
00:49:40,575 --> 00:49:41,743
Want to dig into it?

562
00:49:41,826 --> 00:49:43,202
A case?

563
00:49:44,996 --> 00:49:46,330
What kind of case?

564
00:49:48,374 --> 00:49:50,668
Here! Take photos of these.

565
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:56,424
These are booby traps
that the spies have set all over the dorm.

566
00:49:56,507 --> 00:50:01,596
"It's better for you not to know. What you
don't know won't hurt you." He said.

567
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:07,226
The Hosu hostage situation?

568
00:50:08,436 --> 00:50:09,771
Without An knowing?

569
00:50:09,979 --> 00:50:13,983
On the ANSP's honor, we'll solve
the case safely. Take a photo of me too.

570
00:50:14,067 --> 00:50:15,359
Take it!

571
00:50:19,781 --> 00:50:21,491
We won't give in

572
00:50:21,574 --> 00:50:24,702
<i>to the brutal scheme and threats
from the puppet regime.</i>

573
00:50:24,786 --> 00:50:26,621
<i>The ANSP and military</i>

574
00:50:27,413 --> 00:50:31,000
<i>try our utmost best to rescue</i>

575
00:50:31,751 --> 00:50:34,337
<i>all of 64 hostages safely</i>

576
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:36,464
<i>from the seven Northern spies.</i>

577
00:50:36,547 --> 00:50:39,759
The brutal scheme and threats
from the puppet regime…

578
00:50:41,928 --> 00:50:45,348
They know we're just three,
but they announced that we're seven.

579
00:50:46,307 --> 00:50:49,268
Should I trust them and
follow the instructions from the party?

580
00:50:49,352 --> 00:50:51,562
I'm sure they just want to avoid the blame

581
00:50:51,646 --> 00:50:55,775
that they're failing to catch
just three with hundreds of soldiers.

582
00:50:57,401 --> 00:50:58,694
What about ten days later?

583
00:51:00,238 --> 00:51:02,657
They just created four more spies.

584
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:05,910
How do you think they'll put an end
to this hostage situation?

585
00:51:10,039 --> 00:51:12,208
Release half of the hostages.

586
00:51:13,876 --> 00:51:14,752
Pardon?

587
00:51:14,836 --> 00:51:17,088
If 30 hostages get released

588
00:51:17,171 --> 00:51:19,841
and say there are only three spies,

589
00:51:19,924 --> 00:51:21,592
won't that be fun to watch?

590
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:25,972
They won't be any use to you anyway.
Plus, it's hard to control all of them.

591
00:51:29,642 --> 00:51:32,186
I'll release everyone
except the ones we really need.

592
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:34,397
Is there anyone you want to release?

593
00:51:43,489 --> 00:51:48,327
No, I just know Director Eun Chang-su's
daughter is the one we need the most.

594
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,739
We don't intend to hurt you.

595
00:52:25,615 --> 00:52:28,284
We want this to end
without anyone getting hurt.

596
00:52:28,951 --> 00:52:30,661
To prove that, I will

597
00:52:32,788 --> 00:52:34,290
release 30 of you today.

598
00:52:37,418 --> 00:52:38,502
Quiet!

599
00:52:41,964 --> 00:52:43,174
Ms. Pi.

600
00:52:43,925 --> 00:52:45,801
This is the list of those I'll release.

601
00:52:46,385 --> 00:52:47,762
Call their names.

602
00:52:53,434 --> 00:52:54,602
Yeong-ro.

603
00:52:54,727 --> 00:52:55,937
I think they'll release you.

604
00:52:56,604 --> 00:52:58,397
I hope they'll release us too.

605
00:52:58,481 --> 00:53:00,024
Please.

606
00:53:03,319 --> 00:53:04,237
Je Min-gyeong.

607
00:53:05,112 --> 00:53:06,489
Finally!

608
00:53:06,572 --> 00:53:07,865
Kim Bit-ni.

609
00:53:07,949 --> 00:53:09,158
-Hey!
-Me?

610
00:53:09,909 --> 00:53:10,785
Yang Hye-ji.

611
00:53:12,245 --> 00:53:13,579
Kim Dong-hui.

612
00:53:15,289 --> 00:53:16,499
Ko Jeong-gyeong.

613
00:53:18,251 --> 00:53:19,418
-Koo In-na
-Yes!

614
00:53:20,878 --> 00:53:22,546
30 people right away?

615
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:23,798
What?

616
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:25,549
You don't want them?

617
00:53:26,884 --> 00:53:30,054
How could you release them like that?
We got to work together.

618
00:53:30,638 --> 00:53:33,391
Right after the announcement?
It makes no sense.

619
00:53:34,767 --> 00:53:36,894
In return, send in things we demand.

620
00:53:36,978 --> 00:53:38,062
Hey, wait!

621
00:53:39,146 --> 00:53:41,232
Keep them for now. Don't release them yet.

622
00:53:41,315 --> 00:53:43,818
We'll send in anything you need.

623
00:53:44,944 --> 00:53:45,861
And

624
00:53:46,862 --> 00:53:48,030
Dr. Kang…

625
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:51,575
Release her right now.

626
00:53:53,703 --> 00:53:54,829
She won't be released.

627
00:53:55,621 --> 00:53:58,082
<i>She had hidden a gun in her bag.</i>

628
00:53:59,041 --> 00:54:01,168
What? A gun?

629
00:54:02,878 --> 00:54:03,713
You…

630
00:54:03,796 --> 00:54:06,465
If you lay a finger on her, I will--

631
00:54:06,549 --> 00:54:10,678
<i>We need drugs for diabetes
and blood pressure and some men's clothes.</i>

632
00:54:11,387 --> 00:54:14,390
Have the ANSP agent from yesterday
bring them here.

633
00:54:19,854 --> 00:54:21,397
Some cup noodles too.

634
00:54:28,362 --> 00:54:29,655
Ten boxes of cup noodles too.

635
00:54:33,034 --> 00:54:34,618
Hello?

636
00:54:34,702 --> 00:54:38,331
This damn bastard hung up on me again.
What a rude bastard.

637
00:54:38,414 --> 00:54:39,332
Cup noodles.

638
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:43,002
But what kind of cup noodles?

639
00:54:58,351 --> 00:55:00,603
He's such an ungrateful bastard.

640
00:55:01,187 --> 00:55:04,398
We even hid bloodstained towels
in our bras to save him.

641
00:55:04,815 --> 00:55:07,443
How could we not be included in those 30?

642
00:55:07,526 --> 00:55:09,862
Yeong-ro, Seol-hui, and I even got naked.

643
00:55:10,446 --> 00:55:12,698
If only I knew he was such an ingrate.

644
00:55:13,032 --> 00:55:16,243
I mean, how could he not release Yeong-ro?
He knows his brother is dead.

645
00:55:18,496 --> 00:55:19,663
Yeong-ro.

646
00:55:22,541 --> 00:55:24,001
How about we talk to Ms. Pi?

647
00:55:26,003 --> 00:55:29,799
I mean, I know she's cold-hearted,
but I doubt she'll just ignore her.

648
00:55:29,882 --> 00:55:32,968
You're right.
And what's one more person to 30?

649
00:55:33,052 --> 00:55:35,304
Right. Pi may have a nasty temper,

650
00:55:35,888 --> 00:55:37,264
but she's quite eloquent.

651
00:55:37,348 --> 00:55:40,393
You guys obviously don't know her well.

652
00:55:41,143 --> 00:55:43,354
Hey. Dream on.

653
00:55:44,772 --> 00:55:45,689
Bun-ok.

654
00:55:48,943 --> 00:55:50,111
Go bring some water.

655
00:55:51,779 --> 00:55:52,863
Hot water.

656
00:55:59,161 --> 00:56:00,162
You.

657
00:56:01,497 --> 00:56:02,915
Stay put.

658
00:56:04,834 --> 00:56:06,544
But Ms. Pi told me to fetch water.

659
00:56:08,003 --> 00:56:09,296
You little…

660
00:56:19,557 --> 00:56:20,933
Don't take long!

661
00:57:15,362 --> 00:57:17,990
Hold on. What's that?

662
00:57:22,036 --> 00:57:23,204
Oh, my.

663
00:57:23,287 --> 00:57:25,372
What's all this?

664
00:57:26,457 --> 00:57:27,625
I knew it.

665
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:29,460
There's always a silver lining.

666
00:57:30,544 --> 00:57:32,129
What are you doing?

667
00:57:43,724 --> 00:57:47,269
Are you out of your mind?
If you get caught, we'll all die!

668
00:57:47,353 --> 00:57:49,688
Hey, do you think I'm blind or something?

669
00:57:49,772 --> 00:57:51,440
How can I ignore this?

670
00:57:53,025 --> 00:57:54,693
How will they know who took it?

671
00:57:54,777 --> 00:57:56,654
I'll just play dumb.

672
00:57:56,737 --> 00:57:58,030
Darn it.

673
00:58:00,324 --> 00:58:01,408
Of course, they'll know.

674
00:58:01,992 --> 00:58:04,537
Because I'll tell them you took it.

675
00:58:05,746 --> 00:58:07,081
Bun-ok.

676
00:58:07,164 --> 00:58:09,208
How could you say that?

677
00:58:11,001 --> 00:58:13,629
Don't you know
I liked you for your fighting spirit?

678
00:58:14,129 --> 00:58:17,341
Do you take me for a pushover? Damn it.

679
00:58:26,892 --> 00:58:28,561
Damn it. Don't come near me.

680
00:58:28,644 --> 00:58:29,812
Stay away.

681
00:58:31,522 --> 00:58:32,523
Darn it.

682
00:58:54,503 --> 00:58:56,547
I told you!

683
00:58:58,299 --> 00:58:59,842
I told you not to do this.

684
00:58:59,925 --> 00:59:03,304
I told you we'd all die if we were caught!

685
00:59:07,266 --> 00:59:09,518
That wench talked me into it.

686
00:59:09,852 --> 00:59:13,230
She approached me and coaxed me into this!

687
00:59:17,776 --> 00:59:19,320
I didn't.

688
00:59:20,863 --> 00:59:22,239
I really didn't.

689
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:31,874
That damn bastard.

690
00:59:34,376 --> 00:59:36,128
I'm so sorry.

691
00:59:38,881 --> 00:59:41,008
Sang-beom.

692
00:59:41,091 --> 00:59:43,052
What happened to your face?

693
00:59:47,181 --> 00:59:48,557
Please, sir.

694
01:00:02,279 --> 01:00:03,656
Sang-beom.

695
01:00:48,951 --> 01:00:51,662
Sang-beom, you idiot. My goodness.

696
01:00:58,460 --> 01:00:59,920
Please, sir.

697
01:01:01,171 --> 01:01:02,131
Sir.

698
01:01:02,798 --> 01:01:05,259
-Let it slide this once.
-Sir.

699
01:01:05,926 --> 01:01:08,262
He's just an ignorant fool. Please, sir.

700
01:01:10,305 --> 01:01:13,559
It's all my fault. I'm so sorry. Please.

701
01:01:13,726 --> 01:01:14,852
Come here, you fool.

702
01:01:17,479 --> 01:01:18,397
Sang-beom!

703
01:01:18,981 --> 01:01:20,149
Sang-beom!

704
01:01:20,232 --> 01:01:21,692
How dare you!

705
01:01:23,527 --> 01:01:25,779
Please, sir! Are you okay?

706
01:01:30,993 --> 01:01:32,327
-I'm sorry.
-Move!

707
01:01:32,411 --> 01:01:33,370
I'm so sorry.

708
01:01:35,914 --> 01:01:38,125
-Stop hitting him!
-I'm so sorry.

709
01:01:41,795 --> 01:01:44,506
Please don't kill them! Please!

710
01:01:45,632 --> 01:01:48,135
Why are you doing this to us?

711
01:01:48,969 --> 01:01:52,097
Please don't kill them! Please!

712
01:01:52,181 --> 01:01:53,307
You bastard!

713
01:01:54,933 --> 01:01:56,351
Stop it, you s***!

714
01:01:57,186 --> 01:01:58,270
Stop it!

715
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:02,024
You can't do that to an old man!

716
01:02:06,445 --> 01:02:08,155
Go ahead. Shoot me!

717
01:02:08,238 --> 01:02:09,615
Shoot me, you bastard!

718
01:02:09,698 --> 01:02:10,532
Comrade Joo!

719
01:02:10,616 --> 01:02:11,575
Go ahead.

720
01:02:12,159 --> 01:02:13,744
Shoot. Shoot me!

721
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,708
Shoot me, you bastard!

722
01:02:19,792 --> 01:02:20,751
Comrade Joo!

723
01:02:28,759 --> 01:02:30,219
Damn it!

724
01:02:43,607 --> 01:02:45,234
He tried to steal our money--

725
01:02:45,317 --> 01:02:47,361
Lock the three in the prayer room.

726
01:03:04,586 --> 01:03:05,546
That hurts.

727
01:03:22,396 --> 01:03:23,981
You idiot!

728
01:03:24,064 --> 01:03:27,150
You can't just stop
getting into trouble, can you?

729
01:03:27,401 --> 01:03:29,695
What on earth did you do this time?

730
01:03:29,778 --> 01:03:30,654
Shut up.

731
01:03:31,947 --> 01:03:33,949
It's all your fault

732
01:03:35,242 --> 01:03:36,660
I turned out this way.

733
01:03:36,743 --> 01:03:37,661
What?

734
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:43,125
Aren't hundreds of special forces
surrounding this place? Aren't they?

735
01:03:43,709 --> 01:03:44,960
There are just three of them.

736
01:03:45,043 --> 01:03:46,795
Can't they just snipe at them?

737
01:03:46,879 --> 01:03:50,591
They're being cautious
because the hostages might get hurt.

738
01:03:52,426 --> 01:03:55,470
They're right out there.
This is driving me crazy!

739
01:03:55,554 --> 01:03:56,972
Stop it, you idiot!

740
01:03:57,055 --> 01:03:59,808
Oh, my back. It hurts so much.

741
01:04:03,645 --> 01:04:04,771
-Hey.
-Yes?

742
01:04:04,855 --> 01:04:06,690
-Are you okay?
-What? Yes.

743
01:04:06,773 --> 01:04:09,109
Untie me too. Untie me first!

744
01:04:09,693 --> 01:04:11,320
Listen, sir.

745
01:04:11,403 --> 01:04:14,031
I'll tell you a way out of here,

746
01:04:14,114 --> 01:04:15,574
so take him with you.

747
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,368
A way out of here?

748
01:04:18,952 --> 01:04:20,495
Is there a way out?

749
01:04:24,917 --> 01:04:26,084
Come on.

750
01:04:27,085 --> 01:04:28,045
This way.

751
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:32,549
Here. This is the one.

752
01:04:35,135 --> 01:04:38,263
Where does this lead?

753
01:04:38,347 --> 01:04:40,390
If you go all the way down the stairs,

754
01:04:40,474 --> 01:04:43,560
you'll find the exit on basement two.

755
01:05:03,747 --> 01:05:05,457
Just keep working.

756
01:05:10,045 --> 01:05:12,422
Hey! You did such a good job!

757
01:05:12,506 --> 01:05:15,467
You didn't even seem nervous.
You must be a natural on TV.

758
01:05:15,550 --> 01:05:16,843
I'm flattered.

759
01:05:19,763 --> 01:05:21,598
These are things they're demanding.

760
01:05:22,099 --> 01:05:23,266
Get them ready

761
01:05:23,767 --> 01:05:27,104
and have the agent
who was sent in yesterday deliver them.

762
01:05:28,397 --> 01:05:29,940
You mean Jang Han-na?

763
01:05:31,483 --> 01:05:33,276
But she's enraged right now.

764
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,237
How about we send another agent?

765
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:36,947
That bastard said it must be her.

766
01:05:37,531 --> 01:05:40,283
He specifically told me to send her.

767
01:05:40,492 --> 01:05:44,287
He must love women.
That young bastard even hung up on me.

768
01:05:44,371 --> 01:05:45,747
Understood, sir.

769
01:05:46,915 --> 01:05:50,335
By the way, sir, since you stepped up,

770
01:05:50,419 --> 01:05:52,629
things have been going smoothly.

771
01:05:54,923 --> 01:05:56,008
That goes without saying.

772
01:05:57,426 --> 01:05:58,343
Now,

773
01:06:00,137 --> 01:06:03,223
we just need to wait
until the election's over.

774
01:06:04,057 --> 01:06:06,059
Make me some coffee. Nice and sweet.

775
01:06:07,853 --> 01:06:08,729
Do you mean me?

776
01:06:12,899 --> 01:06:14,067
Right away.

777
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:21,324
This is so nice.

778
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:23,410
It really is.

779
01:06:58,403 --> 01:07:01,281
<i>Damn it! I told you, I won't get out!</i>

780
01:07:03,408 --> 01:07:06,745
But why? Why do you not want to get out?

781
01:07:06,828 --> 01:07:09,581
How many times do I have to tell you?

782
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:13,710
While he escapes and brings
the special forces to kill the spies,

783
01:07:13,794 --> 01:07:16,046
I'll turn my life around here!

784
01:07:16,129 --> 01:07:18,423
What? How will a fool like you
turn his life around?

785
01:07:18,507 --> 01:07:19,841
Tell me how you will.

786
01:07:21,343 --> 01:07:23,345
You don't need to know.

787
01:07:23,428 --> 01:07:24,930
Just get out of here alone.

788
01:07:25,639 --> 01:07:28,517
How can I possibly leave without you?

789
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:31,019
God, this is driving me crazy.

790
01:07:31,103 --> 01:07:34,606
Dad, you won't be of any help anyway
if you stay here.

791
01:07:34,689 --> 01:07:37,109
So stop getting in my way

792
01:07:37,192 --> 01:07:38,985
and just go!

793
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,866
For God's sake, Sang-beom!

794
01:08:25,073 --> 01:08:28,410
Don't shoot! I'm Lee Gang-mu, the team
leader of Anti-communist Investigations 1!

795
01:08:29,369 --> 01:08:31,288
SWAT team, follow me!

796
01:08:34,166 --> 01:08:35,041
A situation occurred.

797
01:08:35,125 --> 01:08:39,004
<i>Team Leader Lee Gang-mu just came out
of the exit and is asking us to go in.</i>

798
01:08:45,218 --> 01:08:46,720
Make him go back in right now.

799
01:08:46,803 --> 01:08:49,222
Make him go back in! At all cost!

800
01:08:58,940 --> 01:08:59,816
Follow me now!

801
01:09:04,654 --> 01:09:06,573
We received an order. Go back in.

802
01:09:08,074 --> 01:09:09,868
Who the hell gave such an order?

803
01:09:17,751 --> 01:09:18,835
The exit.

804
01:09:22,964 --> 01:09:24,382
You crazy bastards!

805
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:32,349
If you come any closer,
we'll have to shoot you.

806
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:38,605
Go back in. It's an order.

807
01:09:43,693 --> 01:09:44,986
Go back in!

808
01:11:46,316 --> 01:11:47,150
Sir, please.

809
01:11:48,234 --> 01:11:49,611
Please, sir.

810
01:11:49,694 --> 01:11:51,404
Please don't kill him.

811
01:11:53,907 --> 01:11:55,533
How did that bastard get out?

812
01:11:58,787 --> 01:12:00,080
I'll tell you.

813
01:12:00,163 --> 01:12:02,457
He got out through here. This way.

814
01:12:10,131 --> 01:12:11,299
Here.

815
01:12:50,171 --> 01:12:51,339
<i>Why in ten days?</i>

816
01:12:52,674 --> 01:12:53,883
<i>You seriously don't know?</i>

817
01:12:54,426 --> 01:12:58,012
<i>A veteran spy like you who's been
acting in covert all over Germany?</i>

818
01:12:58,596 --> 01:12:59,597
The doctor?

819
01:13:00,598 --> 01:13:03,726
The South Korean presidential election
is in ten days.

820
01:13:05,854 --> 01:13:07,564
Does it have to do with it?

821
01:13:10,442 --> 01:13:12,777
For the ruling party to regain power,

822
01:13:13,403 --> 01:13:16,114
I think the North and the South
made a secret deal.

823
01:13:16,197 --> 01:13:19,200
As long as the North has
the South at its mercy,

824
01:13:19,784 --> 01:13:21,786
<i>the ANSP can never hurt you guys.</i>

825
01:13:26,833 --> 01:13:30,378
Kang Cheong-ya, the Chief of Surgery
at Hankuk Central Medical Center.

826
01:13:32,297 --> 01:13:33,756
It's taken me

827
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,468
as many as 17 years to come this far.

828
01:13:38,344 --> 01:13:40,138
Only a handful of people

829
01:13:41,347 --> 01:13:44,058
know who I really am, even in the North.

830
01:13:45,351 --> 01:13:49,230
<i>The fact that the party ordered me
to send you back safely</i>

831
01:13:49,731 --> 01:13:52,066
proves how much you mean to the party.

832
01:13:52,484 --> 01:13:53,693
Can't you see that?

833
01:13:59,741 --> 01:14:00,909
DOCTOR, PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION,
SECRET DEAL

834
01:14:00,992 --> 01:14:02,660
The doctor is what?

835
01:14:03,745 --> 01:14:05,705
The doctor the agency sent in…

836
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:08,958
is a Northern spy?

837
01:14:21,638 --> 01:14:23,848
The North and the South made a deal
for the election?

838
01:14:27,477 --> 01:14:29,229
Then the Han I-seop case is also…

839
01:14:35,985 --> 01:14:37,445
And this hostage-taking too?

840
01:15:00,885 --> 01:15:02,595
Go back to your seats!

841
01:15:03,721 --> 01:15:05,223
What was the gunfire about?

842
01:15:06,307 --> 01:15:07,642
You want us to all die?

843
01:15:08,226 --> 01:15:12,230
Watch your tone, you bastard.
Because of you…

844
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:15,942
The ANSP team leader tried
to escape through the exit.

845
01:15:16,025 --> 01:15:18,194
<i>We shot at him to make him go back in.</i>

846
01:15:18,736 --> 01:15:20,572
You made him come back in?

847
01:15:21,614 --> 01:15:22,490
Why?

848
01:15:22,574 --> 01:15:23,950
Why do you think?

849
01:15:24,576 --> 01:15:27,954
He insists we should have the SWAT team
break in. How could we let him out?

850
01:15:28,037 --> 01:15:31,291
<i>What if he comes out here
and tells everyone we should break in?</i>

851
01:15:31,374 --> 01:15:33,209
He'll be a pain in the neck.

852
01:15:33,793 --> 01:15:36,379
<i>It's not looking good.
Why did they have to kill</i>

853
01:15:36,462 --> 01:15:38,506
the ANSP director's son of all people?

854
01:15:38,590 --> 01:15:42,468
Why do I have to talk with a mere spy
like you here, standing by 24 hours?

855
01:15:42,552 --> 01:15:47,265
A high-up like me shouldn't be
doing this. You hear me, you bastard?

856
01:15:54,772 --> 01:15:57,942
Watch him closely
so that he won't come out again. Okay?

857
01:15:58,901 --> 01:16:00,862
Hold out for nine more days,

858
01:16:00,945 --> 01:16:03,781
<i>and we'll send you back to the North
without anyone knowing.</i>

859
01:16:28,181 --> 01:16:31,017
<i>They don't hesitate
to abandon their own agent.</i>

860
01:16:31,601 --> 01:16:33,811
<i>Will they really let us live
as they promised</i>

861
01:16:35,021 --> 01:16:36,689
<i>to the North?</i>

862
01:16:38,983 --> 01:16:41,861
<i>They don't intend to rescue the hostages.</i>

863
01:16:43,237 --> 01:16:45,531
<i>Only to use them
for the presidential election.</i>

864
01:16:47,033 --> 01:16:48,409
<i>Then…</i>

865
01:16:49,994 --> 01:16:52,705
<i>the hostages, as well as me,</i>

866
01:16:54,457 --> 01:16:56,000
<i>and the Northern spies…</i>

867
01:18:20,710 --> 01:18:23,755
The ANSP agent who went out yesterday
is coming back with supplies.

868
01:18:29,469 --> 01:18:31,554
If you want her to live,
don't try anything.

869
01:18:34,974 --> 01:18:36,058
Don't do anything.

870
01:18:36,142 --> 01:18:37,810
You bastard.

871
01:18:38,895 --> 01:18:40,313
Don't you dare touch her!

872
01:18:45,818 --> 01:18:48,279
You think you can get out of here alive?

873
01:18:49,113 --> 01:18:52,575
You used to work in both
East and West Germany, so you must know

874
01:18:53,075 --> 01:18:57,538
this is the scheme the high-ups of
our countries planned for the election.

875
01:18:59,457 --> 01:19:01,417
For them to win the election
by a landslide,

876
01:19:02,001 --> 01:19:06,380
would it be better to rescue all
of the hostages and make people happy?

877
01:19:07,089 --> 01:19:10,593
Or would it be better to kill all of them
and make people furious?

878
01:19:11,552 --> 01:19:13,387
Of course, the latter would be better.

879
01:19:13,471 --> 01:19:16,224
Because that'll make the voters
vote for the ruling party.

880
01:19:17,934 --> 01:19:21,604
They'll spare the Northern spies
while killing all those innocent students?

881
01:19:22,855 --> 01:19:24,357
You think that makes sense?

882
01:19:26,692 --> 01:19:30,530
If you're right,
that means the North gave up on our lives.

883
01:19:31,489 --> 01:19:34,283
The high-ups in the South,
who don't hesitate

884
01:19:36,285 --> 01:19:38,996
to kill the innocent
to gain power, would certainly do that.

885
01:19:40,373 --> 01:19:42,333
But my country is different.

886
01:19:44,418 --> 01:19:45,253
What?

887
01:19:45,336 --> 01:19:48,256
My country never gives up on the comrades
even if they fall behind.

888
01:19:49,882 --> 01:19:52,260
The party considers the people
as its children.

889
01:19:53,261 --> 01:19:54,971
They'd never abandon us.

890
01:19:58,224 --> 01:19:59,392
Look.

891
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:02,645
Wake up, will you?

892
01:20:03,062 --> 01:20:04,730
You still don't get it.

893
01:20:04,814 --> 01:20:07,149
In this scheme
for the presidential election,

894
01:20:07,692 --> 01:20:11,362
pawns like you and I are just tools
to use and throw away.

895
01:20:19,829 --> 01:20:22,373
If that's what I need to be
for my country,

896
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:26,252
I'll gladly be one.

897
01:20:34,635 --> 01:20:37,555
According to An Gyeong-hui,
Chief of Anti-communist Investigations,

898
01:20:37,638 --> 01:20:39,265
in the dorm you can see,

899
01:20:39,348 --> 01:20:41,559
64 hostages, including female students,

900
01:20:41,642 --> 01:20:44,937
are being held hostage
by seven Northern spies.

901
01:20:45,021 --> 01:20:47,148
Because of the gunfire heard not long ago,

902
01:20:47,231 --> 01:20:49,150
people fear for their safety.

903
01:21:03,247 --> 01:21:06,876
<i>You used to work in both
East and West Germany, so you must know</i>

904
01:21:07,335 --> 01:21:08,169
<i>this is</i>

905
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:12,256
<i>the scheme the high-ups of our countries
planned for the election.</i>

906
01:21:15,301 --> 01:21:16,636
<i>Don't you still get it?</i>

907
01:21:17,887 --> 01:21:19,764
<i>Pawns like you and I are just tools</i>

908
01:21:20,681 --> 01:21:22,433
<i>to use and throw away.</i>

909
01:22:07,603 --> 01:22:09,605
Why aren't they rescuing us?

910
01:22:10,189 --> 01:22:11,899
Why aren't they trying anything?

911
01:22:13,651 --> 01:22:14,610
You are

912
01:22:16,028 --> 01:22:17,697
the director's daughter, right?

913
01:22:19,156 --> 01:22:22,243
I have to go see my brother.
I must get out.

914
01:22:23,285 --> 01:22:24,704
What do I need to do?

915
01:22:24,787 --> 01:22:26,664
Help me. Please.

916
01:22:32,586 --> 01:22:34,255
Don't act rashly.

917
01:22:35,965 --> 01:22:38,092
He has a detonator in his pocket.

918
01:22:38,676 --> 01:22:40,219
If he pushes the button,

919
01:22:42,013 --> 01:22:43,889
the whole dorm will explode.

920
01:22:49,645 --> 01:22:52,231
I know it's hard, but be patient.

921
01:22:53,149 --> 01:22:54,734
-I'll come up with--
-Hey!

922
01:22:57,278 --> 01:22:58,821
I just wanted to give him bread.

923
01:23:09,707 --> 01:23:10,541
I need

924
01:23:11,125 --> 01:23:12,626
to go to the restroom.

925
01:23:13,461 --> 01:23:14,962
Can I go?

926
01:23:29,852 --> 01:23:31,020
Make it quick.

927
01:23:38,611 --> 01:23:40,946
-What aren't you going in?
-Comrade Joo.

928
01:23:42,782 --> 01:23:45,951
Leave her to me and go watch the hostages.

929
01:24:14,438 --> 01:24:15,648
Please

930
01:24:17,066 --> 01:24:18,400
let me rest a bit.

931
01:24:25,116 --> 01:24:26,158
Follow me.

932
01:24:37,962 --> 01:24:39,672
You didn't answer my question.

933
01:24:45,136 --> 01:24:46,303
That paper airplane…

934
01:24:48,055 --> 01:24:50,099
That's the one I flew out.

935
01:24:52,685 --> 01:24:54,103
Why do you have it?

936
01:24:58,649 --> 01:25:00,860
Did you come to the dorm because of it?

937
01:25:04,405 --> 01:25:06,323
I just found it while being chased.

938
01:25:07,158 --> 01:25:08,450
Get some rest here.

939
01:25:11,078 --> 01:25:12,329
Then why did you come back?

940
01:25:14,832 --> 01:25:16,250
You should've just left.

941
01:25:17,626 --> 01:25:19,670
Why did you come back here?

942
01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:33,309
I just tried to hide in that old shrine.

943
01:25:35,811 --> 01:25:39,148
If I'd known
it led to the inside of the dorm,

944
01:25:42,943 --> 01:25:44,445
I would never have gone in.

945
01:25:54,955 --> 01:25:56,081
I'm sorry…

946
01:25:59,210 --> 01:26:00,294
about your brother.

947
01:26:11,096 --> 01:26:12,097
We will

948
01:26:13,641 --> 01:26:15,184
leave in nine days.

949
01:26:18,103 --> 01:26:19,980
All this will be over in nine days.

950
01:26:22,316 --> 01:26:24,985
And I don't want to
hurt anyone in this dorm.

951
01:26:25,527 --> 01:26:28,072
I don't want to hurt anyone. I mean it.

952
01:26:29,823 --> 01:26:31,325
I want to

953
01:26:33,744 --> 01:26:35,454
release you right now.

954
01:26:41,585 --> 01:26:43,087
But I can't.

955
01:27:14,201 --> 01:27:15,536
No. Don't go.

956
01:28:46,752 --> 01:28:47,920
If this button is pushed,

957
01:28:49,671 --> 01:28:51,632
the dorm will explode.

958
01:28:53,008 --> 01:28:54,218
Right?

959
01:29:07,064 --> 01:29:08,148
Eun Yeong-ro!

960
01:29:08,732 --> 01:29:11,985
Please believe me.
I don't want to make you suffer anymore.

961
01:29:12,069 --> 01:29:14,863
<i>The party considers the people
as its children. They'd never abandon you?</i>

962
01:29:14,947 --> 01:29:16,198
You really think so?

963
01:29:16,281 --> 01:29:18,700
<i>If you want to go back alive,
just do as I say.</i>

964
01:29:18,784 --> 01:29:21,161
If you don't,
you can just forget about negotiation.

965
01:29:21,245 --> 01:29:23,288
<i>Bring me proof that what you say is true.</i>

966
01:29:23,372 --> 01:29:27,167
Hard evidence that
our countries are scheming to kill us all.

967
01:29:27,251 --> 01:29:29,378
<i>What are you going to do in here?</i>

968
01:29:29,461 --> 01:29:30,879
<i>Be honest with me.</i>

969
01:29:30,963 --> 01:29:33,549
-Are you willing to kill the students too?
<i>-They're not</i>

970
01:29:33,632 --> 01:29:35,300
planning to kill the students, are they?

971
01:29:35,384 --> 01:29:38,429
Let's save the students together.

972
01:29:39,179 --> 01:29:41,181
How about you use me?

973
01:29:41,265 --> 01:29:44,309
<i>Then before that,
there's something you need to know.</i>

974
01:29:44,393 --> 01:29:47,187
<i>We might all be killed?</i>

975
01:29:47,271 --> 01:29:48,397
<i>Eun Yeong-ro ran away.</i>

976
01:29:50,566 --> 01:29:53,819
<i>I must find you first to save you.</i>

977
01:29:59,616 --> 01:30:02,411
BONUS

978
01:30:07,166 --> 01:30:08,375
Yeong-ro, close the door.

979
01:30:08,459 --> 01:30:10,127
Pi might smell it and wake up.

980
01:30:16,592 --> 01:30:18,343
Don't worry, Hye-ryeong.

981
01:30:18,427 --> 01:30:20,512
I checked that
the hall director wasn't in her office.

982
01:30:20,596 --> 01:30:22,055
Fine. Hurry up.

983
01:30:24,516 --> 01:30:27,186
Hey, your partner is really hot.

984
01:30:27,853 --> 01:30:29,146
Set me up with his friend.

985
01:30:29,229 --> 01:30:30,981
Yes. Set me up too.

986
01:30:31,064 --> 01:30:33,734
-Please?
-Please?

987
01:30:34,568 --> 01:30:37,488
I'll talk to him when he calls me.

988
01:30:37,571 --> 01:30:39,364
-Great!
-Great!

989
01:30:40,282 --> 01:30:42,701
His friends? He's being chased--

990
01:30:51,251 --> 01:30:52,669
I haven't seen that necklace before.

991
01:30:54,963 --> 01:30:56,840
-Did he give it to you?
-Really?

992
01:31:01,845 --> 01:31:03,847
Oh, my. I'm so jealous!

993
01:31:03,931 --> 01:31:05,641
Good for you!

994
01:31:07,142 --> 01:31:08,602
That's pretty. What bird is it?

995
01:31:09,436 --> 01:31:10,646
A dove.

996
01:31:11,313 --> 01:31:13,106
-Isn't this a bit salty?
-Yes.

997
