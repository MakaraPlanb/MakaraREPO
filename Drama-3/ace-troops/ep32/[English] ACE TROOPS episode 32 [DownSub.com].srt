what are you looking for?

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,660
Grandpa Zhu.

00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,420
Grandpa Zhu is not here.

00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,740
Grandpa Zhu?

9
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:57,700
Why?

10
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,500
During the rainy season,

11
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:01,980
grandpa Zhu is here everyday.

12
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,940
Everyday there will be a long-distance coach coming in and out,

00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,100
and he will be here to watch.

14
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,620
Boss, we have a bus coming into the village.

15
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,810
They are all civilians.

16
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:21,660
Ignore them.

17

are you sure

21
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,260
they will go by water?

00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,780
I will do this.

Going by water

25
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,600

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,640

how thick these clouds are.

153
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,490
If you jump down blindly,

154
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,080
when you open your eyes,

155
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,160

There is not enough time to response.

157

I have to be responsible for your lives.

158
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,950
We are responsible for ourselves.

159
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,070
We are responsible for ourselves.

160
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,960
Circle one more time.

161
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,200
See if there are any chance.

Hurry.

168
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,400
Look carefully.

169
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,400
Our man is down there.

170
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,120
He is in danger

171
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,760
and he needs us.

172
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,080
Battalion commander Gu,

173
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,440
I was a parachutist before.

174
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,800
I am not afraid of death either.

175
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,880
But,

176
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,920
I have to be responsible for your lives.

177
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,080
Gao,

178
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,600
hang on there.

We are leaving.

184
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:08,960
Goodbye.

185
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,720
You will lose your guy.

186
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,160
I will give their relatives the money.

187
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,720
Go.

00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:27,920
Yeah.

196
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,840
Soldier.

197
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,520
Not police?

198
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,120
This is a tough guy.

199
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,000
Change your shoes.

200
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,440
They will send you abroad.

201
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,200
Take off your shoes to him.

202
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,920
How will you see me off?

203
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,160
I am going to kill him myself.

204
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,080
What are you doing?

205
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,120
Personal grudges?

206
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,760
You're a sensible mercenary.

207
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,920
How could you fight

208
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,360
without being paid?

209
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,720
My professional reputation is important.

210
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,480
He killed so much of my men.

211
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,280
No one would work

212
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,840
with me when I'm back.

213
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,800
I must kill him.

214
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,760
What's your idea?

215
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,640
I know Chinese soldiers.

216
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,560
They got

217
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,640
a strange belief.

218
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,680
They believe that they're responsible

219
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,200
for their people at all times.

220
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,920
They won't hesitate

221
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,040
to sacrifice

222
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,200
themselves.

223
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:56,920
Good.

224
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,240
Very nice.

225
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,080
So that will be the weakness.

226
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,600
Go.

227
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,720
Come on. Go.

228
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,160
Find him out. Go!

229
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,600
Stop! Don't move!

230
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,800
Put down your weapons!

231
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,829
Don't be scared, Jing.

232
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,160
The gunshots are getting closer and closer to us.

233
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,120
Let's leave here!

234
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:00,600
Go!

235
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,240
Go now!

236
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,160
Don't go.

237
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,000
Prince,

238
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,040
we've got a bunch of hostages.

239
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,120
Get the hostages together.

240
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,520
Roger.

241
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,240
Twenty in total.

242
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,680
Good.

243
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,080
Meet at the agreed place.

244
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,720
We're the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

245
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,400
Please put down your weapons.

246
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,800
Stop resisting.

247
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,520
A compartment is a good place.

248
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,520
Because it can make the power of a grenade

249
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,040
exerted for the best.

250
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,040
However, you can use these chairs as shields.

251
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,760
Because

252
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,640
they can help to protect you from

253
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,120
most of the shrapnel.

254
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,800
Showtime.

255
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,020
Hands off!

256
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,880
There are twenty hostages

257
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,880
inside the bus.

258
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,760
Nanzheng is also inside there.

259
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,760
They are guarded only by one terrorist.

260
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,960
But he tied a grenade to the bus.

261
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,960
If we shoot him dead,

262
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,080
it'll explode.

263
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,920
It's easy to handle

264
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,800
the terrorists.

265
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,520
The key is

266
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,880
the grenade

267
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,520
inside the bus.

268
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,320
Don't get off.

269
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,920
You'll only irritate them if you get off now.

270
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,160
I know you're watching.

271
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,160
I'm going to kill them one by one.

272
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,560
You have five minutes.

273
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,390
Only you can stop this.

274
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,160
Come on!

275
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
How long does it take to aim at

276
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
all the terrorists?

277
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,160
Twenty seconds.

278
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,160
If a gunshot is heard,

279
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,320
it means a hostage has been killed.

280
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,560
The fight lasts longer,

281
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,160
it's more dangerous for the hostages.

282
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,080
So the key of the action this time

283
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,760
is to distract

284
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,000
the terrorists' attention

285
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,240
before the raid.

286
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,160
Here's the solution

287
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,880
to Dutch terrorists' hijacking of a train

288
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,880
in 1977.

289
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,080
They sent six supersonic fighters,

290
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,600
and flew low over the train.

291
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,640
The sonic boom of supersonic flight

292
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,440
blasted all the glass of the train.

293
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,720
Then they fired overwhelmingly

294
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,200
and blow up to scare them.

295
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,480
The fight was over soon.

296
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,200
I'm the fighter jet.

297
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,880

Buddy,

328
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,960
You keep nagging about fighting in a war all the time.

329
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,520
We did have one this one.

330
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,600
We had an anti-terrorism war in the era of peace.

581
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,530
All of these are history.

♫Yearning turns into winds. Read my mind, read your mind♫

583
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:41,290
Put them back.

584
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:44,530
When we get old,

585
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:45,650
it will be interesting to see them.

♫Yearning for me, watching over me♫

In the future, Jiang Nanzheng

588
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,450
will live with Gao Liang.

589
00:33:54,040 --> 00:34:01,750
♫Time turns into flowers, like you, like me♫

590
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:54,890
I will try my best.

591

I will be better.

592
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:00,930
You've been great all the time.

593
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:02,630
Don't change.

594
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:17,580
[Division 234, part 700]

595
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:21,250
Don't mention simple shooting with single gun.

596
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:24,199
What do you want to do

597
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:25,889
with double-bang with double firepower?

598
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,889
Why do you always show me the unreliable thing?

599
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:31,810
Ten percent of mortar problems are due to ammunition

600
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:34,239
and one percent of that  is due to shooting speed.

601
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,050
If you increase the shooting speed,

602
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:37,889
the danger will increase by a hundred times.

603
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,570
Now all units

604
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:41,719
have suspended

605
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,530
high-risk subjects one after another.

606
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:45,010
Aren't you afraid of an accident

607
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,050
by going against the trend?

608
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:49,650
These technologies are limited by terrain and personnel.

609
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,650
They are easy to maneuver and have high practical value.

610
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,610
There are certainly some risks in training.

611
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:56,889
But if we can't win on the battlefield,

612
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:58,730
it will be the biggest danger.

613
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:01,050
But it's still not like what you would do.

614
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:03,250
I've heard

615
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:05,450
Gao Liang was doing these

616
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,130
in Regiment 720 before.

617
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:08,570
I don't want to give up these subjects.

618
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,010
But he belongs to Regiment 720.

619
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:11,410
You belongs to Regiment 700.

620
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,930
If you do these because of him,

621
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,450
I won't agree with it.

622
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,290
From the small aspects,

623
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:18,170
we are Division 234.

624
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,450
From the big aspects,

625
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:20,770
we are all People's Liberation Army.

626
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,610
However, these techniques

627
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,450
are like crafts,

628
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:27,810
and it takes time to improve them.

629
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:30,330
This requires investment and talent.

630
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:31,370
Its rate of fostering talents is low.

631
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,290
After so many years,

632
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:34,930
people have only remembered

633
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:35,730
the general Zhao Zhangcheng.

634
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:39,010
During the demonstration and competition in military skills in the 1960s,

635
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:41,730
General Zhao is also doing demonstration teaching at the grass-roots level.

636
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:44,050
This shows that

637
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,090
many experiences gained during the war

638
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:46,650
will be lost

639
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:47,730
if they are not used at the grass-roots level.

640
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,530
No matter how long peace has lasted,

641
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,050
our troops

642
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,610
should keep some techniques.

643
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,370
We can't

644
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:55,450
have them lost.

645
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,330
I understand

646
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:02,690
when you say that.

647
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,090
But Yiye,

648
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,770
you must pay attention to risks.

649
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:10,410
People don't like such a person

650
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:12,970
who runs in the morning.

651
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:16,210
while everyone else in the same room is sleeping.

652
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,050
Release.

653
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,890
Huang Tianwei, the sergeant of Squad Three,

654
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,410
is really good.

655
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,530
He never forgets

656
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:44,690
the technology he has learned.

657
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:46,330
They are all training objects.

658
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:49,930
Release.

659
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,130
Quickly, second platoon leader.

660
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:10,730
Who is him?

661
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:11,930
A second lieutenant?

662
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,570
Quickly, second platoon leader.

663
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,810
Yu Sizhe, the new acting second platoon leader.

664
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,050
Second platoon leader.

665
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:24,770
Isn't Chen Jian the second platoon

666
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,890
leader in gun company?

667
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,570
He participated in the crack gunner training of the group army.

668
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,240
He will come back in three months.

669
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:32,410
When did we have this second platoon leader?

670
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,170
Just checked in.

671
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,180
He was appointed as

672
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,620
the acting second platoon leader of the gun company.

673
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:39,050
You're holding on to this little thing,

674
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:40,570
aren't you?

675
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:41,530
Director,

676
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:42,890
this is not a tiny thing.

677
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:44,490
The honor of the First Battalion of the Red

678
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:47,010
has been accumulated in the step-by-step trek

679
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:48,330
and shot by shot of officers and soldiers in the First Battalion of the Red.

680
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:50,450
This is about the morale of the officers and soldiers of the First Battalion of the Red.

681
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:52,090
Although I have a small position,

682
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,810
I will never shrink my head

683
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:55,050
when I need to bear the responsibility.

684
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:56,810
You're scoffing me, aren't you?

685
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,960
My position is big

686
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,680
so I am suitable to bear the responsibility.

687
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,680
Director,

688
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,080
I say it again.

689
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,560
This man is not suitable to be

690
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,760
the acting platoon leader of the gun company.

691
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,560
Please return him to the regiment

692
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,440
and make other arrangements.

693
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,480
Are you crazy, Gu Yiye?

694
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,800
How dare you command me?

695
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,120
Whether you understand it

696
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,840
or not, you have to implement it.

697
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,680
In a word,

698
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:16,920
he can't leave.

699
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,200
I...

700
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,000
Background.

701
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,560
Even if there is a background, he has to be reasonable.

702
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,040
How can the First Battalion of the Red,

703
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,640
a top troop of the whole military region,

704
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,960
allow such a person to be the platoon leader.

705
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,720
What will be the result?

706
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,480
Have they thought about it?

707
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,490
If it's not the First Battalion of the Red, he wouldn't have come.

708
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,280
He is for getting gilded.

709
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,960
The training of the First Battalion of the Reds is so harsh

710
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,800
that he can't stand it

711
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,480
if you let him work for a long time.

712
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,920
I estimate that he has calculated the three months

713
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,000
since the second platoon leader left the line.

714
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,880
As soon as the training of crack gunner is over,

715
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,600
he will take this grass-roots resume

716
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,000
accumulated in the gun company

717
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,330
and go back to find a chance for promotion.

718
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:53,560
That's how bad the atmosphere is.

719
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,000
It can't be.

720
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,560
I can't let them do this recklessly.

721
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,120
I am going to visit the regimental commander.

722
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,080
Mule Gu, can you calm down?

723
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,960
How do you know the regimental commander has no pressure?

724
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,360
If he's under pressure, who does he talk to?

725
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,520
Try first.

726
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,120
Train him.

727
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,600
At least let him learn some real skills,

728
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,840
which is worth it.

729
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,440
The second group, run.

730
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,200
Squat down.

731
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,360
Sergeant,

732
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,920
if it explodes wrongly,

733
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,640
will all of us die?

734
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,160
This is smoke bomb.

735
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,720
It consists of 600 grams of yellow phosphorus and 25 grams of RDX.

736
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,400
If it does explode,

737
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,480
just both of us die.

738
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,360
If I want to make military exploit,

739
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,560
I have to take risks.

740
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,320
Ready!

741
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,480
Release.

742
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,120
Lie down.

743
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,800
The people haven't recovered yet.

744
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,800
The cause of the accident has not been worked out.

745
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,840
They took him away.

746
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:22,760
They want to hide him.

747
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,880
Mule Gu,

748
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,840
shut up.

749
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,600
You said that he didn't perform well

750
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,760
and that he shouldn't be awarded Merit Citation Class III.

751
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,520
That must

752
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,560
have been heard by him.

753
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,120
In order to make your mouth shut,

754
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,420
he wants to get some achievements in training.

755
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,240
But he...

756
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,240
I remind you.

757
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,240
Don't mess with the division working group.

758
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,680
Shut up.

759
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,080
What can I do for you?

760
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:02,920
What's this?

761
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,720
Bone scraps

762
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,960
pulled from Yu Sizhe

763
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,400
during debridement in the hospital.

764
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,960
Don't be nervous.

765
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,440
It's not his.

766
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,240
It's Huang Tianwei's.

767
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,960
What are you doing?

768
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,240
I can't find Yu Sizhe.

769
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,920
I've heard he was brought to the Division.

770
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,440
I've also heard that he will be praised for his meritorious service.

771
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,760
So I've brought him some material.

772
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,240
When you give the report,

773
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,560
you can show it to everyone.

774
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,240
Listen to me, Gu Yiye.

775
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,920
The division working group has investigated it.

776
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,600
It was Huang Tianwei who found the repeated loading

777
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,020
and warned them.

778
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,240
But it was Yu Sizhe

779
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,600
who finally saved people.

780
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:58,840
Understand?

781
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,160
Division commander.

782
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:00,920
What conditions?

783
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:02,960
What？

784
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,720
What are the conditions for Huang Tianwei to lie?

785
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,720
Nonsense.

786
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,680
What are the conditions

787
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,760
for you to help Yu Sizhe like this?

788
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,680
Shut up.

789
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:16,620
[Military soul]

790
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:13,720
I ask you.

791
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,640
Who wants an accident?

792
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:18,160
Nobody.

793
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,830
But it occurred.

794
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:21,920
What can we do?

795
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,040
How can make everyone suffer the least

796
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,720
and get the most compensation?

797
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,400
This is what we should consider.

798
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,280
The parties have agreed.

799
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,210
What are you dissatisfied with?

800
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,160
I disagree.

801
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:34,880
You disagree?

802
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,280
What gives you the right to disagree?

803
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,120
Gu Yiye.

804
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,760
You are a qualified and experienced person in our army.

805
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:43,880
Honestly speaking,

806
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,680
in order to protect you,

807
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,360
I didn't hold you accountable.

808
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,320
If I do,

809
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,400
do you think you can get out?

810
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,960
Then be realistic.

811
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,320
Say what you have to say.

812
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,000
If the division

813
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,720
believes in this conclusion,

814
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,510
I will also report the real situation

815
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,640
to the superior.

816
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,000
OK.
