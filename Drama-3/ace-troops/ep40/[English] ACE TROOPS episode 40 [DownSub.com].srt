00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,880
let Army A have a place

191

in the coming military reform

192
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,000
and have a chance to win.

193

Commander,

194
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,440
you will not be able to

195
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,320
protect the unit and formation of this army.

196
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,440
Not only can you protect it...

197
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,400
I need to try regardless of the result.

198
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,320
If I cannot save it,

199
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,280
where should the 50,000 soldiers

200
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,240
risking their life go?

201
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,360
Go back home and hug their children?

202
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,920
Do you know

203
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,360
how much blood the martyrs devoted to

204
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,040
the honor of the flag of Army A?

205
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,160
It includes

soldiers.

211
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:18,960
If

212
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,280
we lose the unit and formation,

213
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,680
where can they

214
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,960
find their former army?

215
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,800
Can I tell them

216
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,440
to find it in the military history museum?

217
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,240
How should I tell the truth to my old chief

218
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,640
and my old comrades in the army?

219
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,960
As long as I am in this position,

220
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,760
I will never let such a thing happen.

221
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,160
Unless

222
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,160

is the engine to regional economic growth.

227
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,640
The strategy

228
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,720
has brought new vitality to southeast Asia.

At the same time,

230
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,400
I would also like to thank China

231
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,360
for its contribution to the regional peace.

cannot come here

as he is visiting other cities.

259
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,040
So he assigned me

260
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,120
to contact you.

261
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,320
Thank you all.

262
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,480
My officer has already introduced the details

263

to his Chinese counter partners.

Now,

265
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,920
I would give some brief introduction

270
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,160
He is also a very good friend of the king.

271
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,640
He has encountered difficulties

272
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,360
that are very hard to overcome.

273
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,440
I was entrusted by the king

274
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,880
to bring him here for help.

275
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,360
Respected Chinese friends.

276
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,720
Please save my grandson.

00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,160
And he is my only grandson

279
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,840
and my successor.

280
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,720
At the beginning of the month,

281
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,760
Kim started his first

282
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,400
global voyage

283
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,840
in his life time.

284
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,640
About two weeks ago,

285
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,360
he met some pirates

286
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,640
in the Strait of Malacca

287
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,360
and was kidnapped.

288
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,400
We hired a security advisor with a universal relationship

289
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,800
in the intelligence community

290
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:22,840
and knew

291
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,320
an unfortunate message.

292
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,560
Kim was bought

293
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,520
by someone with 10 thousand dollars from the pirates.

294
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,520
The one who bought Kim

295
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,040
is a terrorist,

296
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,680
who

297
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,480
travels between Middle Asia and West Asia constantly.

298
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,880
As he is afraid of the attack

299
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,200
from drones and missiles to him.

300
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,800
He tends to hold a hostage

301
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,360
in his place of hiding all the time.

302
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,000
In this way,

303
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,280
the air attack aiming him will be restrained.

304
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,520
Last month,

305
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,680
the hostage he held for five years

306
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,920
died due to disease

307
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,880
unfortunately.

308
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,920
So he needed a new one,

309
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,440
a new amulet.

310
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,760
He chose Kim.

311
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,200
Our Defense Minister held a meeting

312
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,000
and finally considered

313
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,040
that our military capacity

314
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,109
and diplomatic resources

315
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,640
were not capable of

316
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,310
such a rescue operation.

317
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,440
Now,

318
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,200
Chinese government and army

319
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,920
are our last hope.

We need someone.

325
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,440
Who?

326
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:04,690
Hello.

327
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,880

belongs to the ground force.

333
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,280
It has nothing to do with Region N.

334
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,360
You just want me to gather there with your command?

335
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,560
You are thinking too much.

336
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,240
Don't forget.

337
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,720
Your son is in my hand.

338
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,240
Be cautious or I will take it out on him.

339
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,920
Stop the nonsense. It's formal.

340
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,960
The order of the Military Commission has reached your department.

341

Come quickly.

342
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,000
Make it clear.

343
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,280
The Military Commission or the Ground Force.

344
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,380
The Military Commission, the highest command.

345

Have you seen the helicopter?

346

Save your words and get aboard quickly.

we are all waiting for you.

354
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,080
Please have a seat.

355
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,760
Yes, sir.

356
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,040
I will make some introductions.

357
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,120
In 1990s,

358
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,280
Mr. Yi,

359
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,200

360

provided selfless help

361
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,600
for us

362
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,840
in shipping and finance.

363
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,840
Mr. Yi

364
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,920
is an old friend of Chinese people.

365
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,240
Apart from that,

366
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,560
we have got

367
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,080
two pieces of relevant information.

368
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,040
I will let

369
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,680
our colleague of intelligence service

370
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,240
explain it to everybody.

371
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,880
Next,

372
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,640
I would like to add up two points.

373
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,440
First,

374
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,880
before the business ship of Country T

375
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,200
was hijacked by pirates,

376
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,640
they hijacked a Chinese fishing boat

377
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,520
as cover first.

378
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,480
We are not sure about

379
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,160
the number of hostages till now.

380
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,000
Please have a look, everyone.

381
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,480
This is a sea island

382
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,320
I found in Region X.

383
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,160
It is the

384
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,200
headquarter where

385
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,760
the pirates have been living for these days.

386
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,200
Our hostages

387
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,240
should be prisoned here.

388
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,640
The terrorist

389
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,560
who bought hostages from the pirates

390
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,600
is Prince.

391
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,440
He ever committed crime in China

392
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,360
and had fought with Chinese army and police before.

393
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,000
But he escaped.

394
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,600
He carries

395
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,280
a debt of blood

396
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,760
of Chinese people and our friends.

397
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,680
I have been tracking him for almost 20 years.

398
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,240
This is one of the important reasons

399
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,720
why I am

400
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,920
here today.

401
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,680
Yiye.

402
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,440
According to the information from Country T,

403
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,760
Prince

404
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,160
has transported Kim

405
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,160
with his own

406
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,600

407
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,960
to Country P,

408
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,720
and he is being transferred to a strongpoint in the middle of Middle Asia.

409
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,280
He will

410
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,840
meet a bunch of desperadoes

411
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,280
and go to

412
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,320
a terrorist training camp together

413
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,160
in the mountainous area of Hindu Kush.

414
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,360
And he will

415
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,560
prison the hostage there.

416
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,560
Prince has turned this place

417
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,200
into a transportation supply station

418
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,200
to steal into China

419
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,600
for terrorists.

420
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,680
It has threatened

421
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,520
the security of China.

422
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,600
If we decide to take action,

423
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,200
the fight

424
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,720
should be divided into two parts.

425
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,040
The first

426
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,960
is to strike suddenly and destroy

427
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,560
the terrorist transportation station

428
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,960
in the mountainous area of the northwestern border of China,

429
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,720
save Kim, the hostage,

430
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,880
and capture and kill

433

Prince.

434
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,040
The other part

435
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,160
is to attack

436
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,040
the pirate base in the nameless island in the South China Sea,

437
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,720
and save the hostages prisoned by the pirates.

438
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,760
As the two targeted groups

439
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,640
may contact each other through satellite phones,

440
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,600
the two sides should take action together.

441
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,200
Considering the time difference,

442
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,360
we only have

443
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,760
about 14 hours

444
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,200
left

445
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,680
before the action starts.

446
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:06,920
Okay.

447
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,640

Before the military reform,

470
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,600
the training

471

of intelligence service and supportability

472
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,320
was not enough for supporting special forces

473
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,360
to accomplish

474
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,800
such combat missions

that cross the whole area of China.

498
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,840
You just need to check the clock

499
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,480
and make sure two sides

500
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,480
start the action together.

501
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,840
After the operation begins,

502
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,480
we will screen

Hello.

509

How will you go there?

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,600
Height of the cabin.

512
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,240
4,200 meters

513
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,360
High Altitude Low Opening.

514
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,760
The altitude is high there.

515
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,080
It is quiet at night.

516
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,480
The planes need to pass at that height

517
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,280
without being found.

518
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,160
Take care of Gao Liang.

519
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,160
Are you jumping, too?

520
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,840
What do you mean?

521
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,600
Of course I need to jump.

522
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,760
You need to stay at the command post of frontline.

523
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,840
I am the commander of the frontline only when I jump with you.

524
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,040
But you didn't participate

525
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,160
the running-in training with us.

526
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,400
Don't worry.

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,120
I participated in such projects before.

00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,280
Okay.

529
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,200
But there is a bottomline.

530
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,120
You need to jump with us,

531
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,920
in the team.

532
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,520
Okay.

533
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,760
And me.

534
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,360
I want to go, too.

535
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,520
You too?

536
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,280
Absolutely no.

537
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,400
We cannot have any

538
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,440
unforeseen factors anymore.

539
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,400
Xia Lin,

540
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,920
you never

541
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,360
jumped in this project before.

542
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,840
It is indeed dangerous.

543
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,400
Alright.

544
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,960
I won't make trouble for you.

545
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,040
Come back safe.

546
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,240
Okay.

547
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,360
Gao Liang.

548
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,360
Wear it for me for one day.

549
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:19,920
Xiaofei.

550
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,440
Pay some attention to your dad.

551
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,440
He is boarding the island by helicopter, too.

552
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,680
Don't let emotions

553
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,620
influence your judgement.

554
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,160

557
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,640
and come back safe.

558
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,800
This is the target.

559
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,960
He came to China

560
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,760
many years ago.

561
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,560
I ever fought against him.

562
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,640
But he escaped.

563
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,960
He once killed

564
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,360
our citizens,

565
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,880
police and armed police.

566
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,960
The wife of Director Xia

567
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,680
was killed by a mine

568
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,880
just a few days after the wedding.

569
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,400
The mines

570
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,840
were buried by him.

571
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,520
For all these years,

572
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,400
Director Xia has been

573
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,600
waiting for this moment.

574
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:23,960

00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,200
Our heroic army

768

has the confidence and capability

769
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,840

00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,120
safety

771
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,200
and interests of development.

772
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,320
Our heroic army

773
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,480
as the confidence and capability

774
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,040
to write a new chapter of a strong army,

775
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,380
and make new

776
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:24,160

777
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,480

and protecting world peace.

779
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,120
Brother.

780
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,920
Witnessing our team

781
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,680
go through the combats

782
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,240
and the history,

783
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,160
I now understand

784
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,400
what that watch means to me.

785
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,280
Our army

786
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,680

is always on the road.

789
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,520
Chinese army

790
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,000
is becoming strong from backwardness.
