You all saw that.

What were they doing?

00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,440
What were you doing?

10
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,800
Before the meeting today,

11
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,720
someone came to me

12
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,520
and reflected the cheating

13
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,280
during the maneuvers.

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,840
The new Company Commander
of the Ninth Company of Regiment 720,

15
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,240
Gao Liang,

16
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,520
cheated during the maneuvers.

17
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,240
Instead of

18
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,120
trying to win,

19
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,280
he let

20
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,720
the opponent off his hands

21
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,560
and let him blow up the ammunition dump,

22
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,000
having Regiment 700 win it.

23
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,200
So, today,

24
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,440
I called the people involved in this incident

25
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,920
to attend this meeting.

26
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,280
Political Commissar,

27
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,600
we can have a discussion

28
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,200
on this issue.

29
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,640
I want to say something.

30
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,079
We've been away from war for so many years

31
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,800
that many comrades now take the army

32
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,320
as a pasture for poultry,

33
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:56,840
and regard the maneuvers

34
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,360
as vanity fair.

35
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,280
Instead of victory on the battlefield,

36
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,000
they compete just for

37
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,920
the chance of getting promoted,

38
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,280
which is

39
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,680
a dangerous situation.

40
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,560
Political Commissar's words
hit the nail on the head.

41
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,120
The military

42
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,920
exists for the purpose of war.

43
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,840
As for a soldier,

44
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,240
indulgence in peace

45
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,320
is a disease.

46
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,120
It devours our fighting capacity

47
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,520
and spirit.

48
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,200
Any soldier

49
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,920
who fails to face peace properly

50
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,520
will slip off the right track.

51
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,560
They do not take the actual fighting capacity

52
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,200
as the standard,

53
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,600
but make false

54
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,160
and superficial efforts.

55
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,640
This is the most obvious point!

56
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,680

[Traitor]

58
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,360
a Company Commander cheated.

59
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,440
Let's take a closer look at

60
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,200
who benefits and who suffers.

61
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,720
On the face of it,

62
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,480
Regiment 720 was typically entrapped.

63
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,320
They lost a sure and certain victory

64
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,280
and gave it to Regiment 700

65
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,760
because of a traitor.

66
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,640
Then we have to ask the Company Commander.

67
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,920
Why did you do that?

68
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,120
What's wrong with you?

69
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,000
Why you betrayed your troop?

70
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,160
Did Regiment 700

71
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,829
bribe you?

72
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:19,920
No.

73
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,360
I don't think so.

74
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,320
He just

75
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,360
didn't want Regiment 720 to win.

76
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,000
So,

77
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,040
what could possibly go wrong

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,080
that would make a Company Commander

79
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,400
not want his troop

80
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,600
to win in the maneuvers?

81
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,280
The answer is fake.

82
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,440
Fake training,

83
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,560
fake maneuvers,

84
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,920
fake victory,

85
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,400
and fake morale.

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,920
The Company Commander wanted to smash his bones

87
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,360
to blow up all this,

88
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,120
which led to the cheating in the maneuvers.

89
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:55,760
Report.

90
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,760
I think the issue of Gao Liang,
Commander of the Ninth Company,

91
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,200
can be re-examined.

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,760
Sit down!

93
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,760
Yes, sir.

94
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,640
I don't want to discuss

95
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,560
what this Company Commander did at all.

96
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,800
As for the Company Commander,

97
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,080
it's up to you

98
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,000
whether to punish him

99
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,720
or reward him.

100
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,800
This issue, however,

101
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,600
is not even worth mentioning.

102
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,520
Regiment 720 is an example,

103
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,600
and a negative one.

104
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,960
Over the years,

105
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,040
you look very glamorous

106
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,480
and have played a lot of fancy games.

107
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,760
But in terms of fighting capacity,

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,240
what level are you on?

109
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,640
In this grenade incident,

110
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,080
three people were injured

111
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,680
and two were disabled.

112
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,560
This is a lesson paid by blood.

113
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,200
Your main leaders should be responsible for it!

114
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,080
In fact,

115
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,320
this tendency

116
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,400
exists in many units.

117
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,760
They have a lot of examples

118
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,920
and rich experience.

119
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,360
They only focus on superiors,

120
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,080
and never think about the future battlefield.

121
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,760
It will lead our troops

122
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,440
to deaths in comfort!

123
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,000
To sum up,

124
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,640
if you can't win the battle,

125
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,200
everything will be in vain.

126
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,080
This is my summary of

127
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,640
the maneuvers today.

128
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,880

129
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,159

130
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,680
-next,
-Hurry up.

131
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,320
there will be a major overhaul of

132
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,520
Regiment 720 by the Division,

133
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,560
starting with the leading cadres.

134
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,240
Song Jianshe

135
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,680
was supposed to be

136
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,880
the Colonel of Regiment 720,

137
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,280
but now it seems that

138
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,600
this plan needs to be adjusted.

139
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:56,000
The Division is going to transfer him

140
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,280
to Logistics Department of the Division Office.

141
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,840
However, who should be appointed as

142
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,240
the Colonel of Regiment 720

143
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,360
is now the hardest problem.

144
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,880
He needs to be both capable

145
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,840
and familiar with Regiment 720.

146
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,760
It's not easy to choose.

147
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,920
Just put it aside for now.

148
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,760
Let me ask you,

149
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,760
who transferred the Second
Battalion of Artillery Regiment

150
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,120
to Sandouping

151
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,120
and almost crippled Qin Hanyong?

152
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,800
Lu Pingfan, Chief of Staff of Regiment 720.

153
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,840
Him?

154
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,120
He's kind of talented,

155
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,240
but has many problems.

156
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,480
What do you mean?

157
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:25,960
He's arrogant.

158
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,960
He doesn't get along with anyone who leads him.

159
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
Is that a problem?

160
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,880
I think that's an advantage.

161
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,040
Even a good horse has a temper.

162
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
I think we can consider

163
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,880
handing over Regiment 720 to him.

164
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,840
When he and Qin Hanyong
were Company Commanders,

165
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,440
they competed.

166
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,840
Now let them be the Colonels,

167
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,240
and then compete.

168
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,960
This is not a bad thing

169
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,000
for the building of regiments.

170
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,520
What?

171
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,240
You think I'm meddling in your cadre issues?

172
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,600
No.

173
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,080
He's been transferred to the Command Academy.

174
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,120
What?

175
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,320
Can you call it off?

176
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,400
The Division has already approved it.

177
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,200
There is no need to stop it in the army, right?

178
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,760
No need to stop?

179
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,560
In the war years,

180
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,200
when a good gun's lost,

181
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,000
not to say a soldier,

182
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,960
even Platoon Leader and Company Commander,

183
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,680
would be sad for days.

184
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,360
Now,

185
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,280
Regiment 720

186
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,280
has cultivated a good cadre

187
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,960
who understands command.

188
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,520
But you let him go?

189
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,960
The regiment felt no pity for that,

190
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,360
how about you in the Division?

191
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,960
Chen Dashan,

192
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,549
don't stare at subordinates

193
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,400
whenever there is a problem.

194
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:42,840
To cure the peace diseases,

195
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,560
we must start with cadres
at the division level.

196
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,160
Understand?

197
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,800
Yes, sir!

198
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,400
If there is no suitable candidate,

199
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,800
transfer Qin Hanyong

200
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,040
back to Regiment 720.

201

Qin Dapao?

202
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,920
What if…

203
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,160
What if he disagrees?

204
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:58,880
He disagrees?

205
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,360
If so, I'll shoot him myself.

206
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:08,510

Get away from me!

210
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,240
Since my first year as a soldier,

211
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,680
I've been dreaming of being

212
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,840
the Colonel of Regiment 700.

213
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,120
After 20 years,

214
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,200
I became the Acting Colonel

215
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,600
and got so close to my dream.

216
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,720
But you took it away.

217
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,720
Just raise your consciousness, okay?

218
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,160
Does it really matter

219
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,640
which regiment you lead as a Colonel?

220
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,120
Stop being sarcastic.

221
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,000
I didn't expect you to be this agitated.

222
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,720
Shut up!

223
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,160
Ever since I became

224
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,800
the Acting Colonel of Regiment 700,

225
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,840
I've been working day and night.

226
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,600
It's over now.

227
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,800
All hope is lost.

228
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,280
I heard that

229
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,400
it was Army Commander Zheng

230
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,080
who suggested the divisional

transferring you to Regiment 720.

232
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,720
I'll go reason with him.

Don't move.

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,000
You're leaving so soon.

238
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,160
Don't pretend to be merciful in front of me.

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,400
Aren't you expecting this all the time?

Qin Hanyong is coming back,

Now, Regiment 720

243
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,400
is the Ninth Company's world again.

244
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,160
You are my nemesis!

245
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,120

00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,920
Exactly what I want.

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,520
The Ninth Company was solid before.

249

this opportunity.

00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,880

Fine.

you would be removed from the post of Colonel

you are suitable

I know you don't like many of my practices,

00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,440
will fight bravely

334

and shed blood on the battlefield.

335
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,400
But I do not agree that

336
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,760
war should be

00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,320

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,200
pay great sacrifice for it.

341
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,600
Times are different, Chief.

342
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,520
In the first half of this century,

343
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
the theme of time was war

344
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,560
and revolution.

345
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,480
Now,

346
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,320
we are in the nineties,

and the themes of our time are peace and development.

Some of the soldiers I led

349
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,600
came from remote places

350
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,000
and wanted to change their fate.

351
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,120
Some came back from the battlefield

352
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,400
and experienced a narrow escape.

00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,920

But in any case,

356
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,960
they've all sacrificed

00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,520
It is an age of peace.

360
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,400
Is it necessary

361
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,480
for them

362
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,280
to shed blood

363
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,760
or give their lives

364
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,160
in regular training and maneuvers?

365
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,080
Many people believe that

366
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,880
since we're not at war,

367
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,840
the army's fighting capacity is less important.

368
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,800
We can put the weapons back in the arsenal

369
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,120
and graze the war horses on the hillside.

370
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:44,840
Everything

371
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,200
can be solved on the negotiating table.

372
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,040
But is it?

373
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,560
Stupid!

374
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,320
Naive!

375
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,920
Do you think war will not break out?

376
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,160
Do you think war is far away from us?

377
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,920
If we had not fought in the Korean War,

378
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,240
the Americans would have
hit our doorstep long ago.

00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,040
Lenin's “Imperialism”

384
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,160
and read it.

385
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,960
There are two of them

386
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,400
in the division library.

387
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,600
The old one was torn by Gao Liang,

388
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,400
and I asked him to compensate with a new one.

389
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,680
Read it thoroughly,

390
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,800
and you will understand

391
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,680
the nature of imperialism.

392
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,200
You will understand

393
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,120
the mission of a soldier.

394
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:33,960
Yes, sir.

395
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,960
There is no other reason

396
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,240
why the maneuvers failed.

397
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,520
It's because something in your mind

398
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,560
went wrong.

399
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,240
I hope to see

400
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,240
the courageous Song Jianshe again.

401
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,800
Hey, Chunyu,

402
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,160
why are you here?

403
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,280
I knew about Xia Lin.

404
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,109
Xia Lin was demoted,

405
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,040
and almost got demobilized

406
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,589
because of the Ninth Company.

407
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,800
It is me who should be demoted.

408
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,640
He was the Acting Battalion Commander

409
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,069
and should be held accountable.

410
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,349
Where was he transferred?

411
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,680
The Military Training Section.

412
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,440
Deputy Chief of Staff He stood up for him.

413
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,600
Actually, I feel sorry

414
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,080
for Xia Lin personally.

415
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,760
But for the Ninth Company,

416
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,400
it's not a bad thing to transfer him away.

417
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,600
I understand.

418
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,840
But then again,

419
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,280
he did his duty as a soldier

420
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,200
and was an uncompromising performer,

421
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,560
and that's where he shone.

422
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,080
But he's in the wrong direction.

423
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,160
In the wrong direction,

424
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,880
the better he is,

425
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,360
the worse he is.

426
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,840
He's not like you.

427
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,640
You dare to stick to yourself,

428
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,400
lead soldiers down-to-earth,
and pay attention to practical results.

429
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,080
And he

430
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,680
does sometimes pay attention to form.

431
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,560
In fact, if you two combine,

432
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,600
you are the most perfect commander.

433
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,920
Thank you for the advice.

434
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,280
So why are you here?

435
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,920
Let's have a seat and talk about it.

436
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:20,800
Have a seat, please.

437
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm really

438
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,570
worried about you.

439
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,120
I know about Hou Jian.

440
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,080
He pursued Nanzheng

441
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,040
when he was at school.

442
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,440
But Nanzheng didn't take it seriously.

443
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,750
He's just a good helper at work for Nanzheng.

444
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,160
How can an inexperienced
young man be a good helper?

445
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,400
Don't blame others,

446
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,760
blame yourself.

447
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,000
Do you really like Nanzheng?

448
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,840
How could you ask that?

449
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,160
The person I care about

450
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,520
and like most in this world

451
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,600
is Nanzheng.

452
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,840
I'm curious

453
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,240
where the courage you had
in the New Recruit Company is now?

454
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,840
At that time, you were not allowed

455
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,840
to have a relationship,

456
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,560
but you showed yourself everywhere.

457
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,880
Now that you are allowed,

458
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,120
you are afraid to do so.

459
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,920
What are you afraid of exactly?

460
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,160
I am afraid that I am not good enough.

461
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,320
Excuse me?

462
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,880
That doesn't sound like you

463
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,680
at all.

464
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,720
Nanzheng is a good girl

465
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,200
and has made great progress
in the past two years.

466
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,240
But you're a Company Commander,

467
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,840
and you'll get better in the future.

468
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,400
So that's not good enough?

469
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,040
It's not what I meant.

470
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,800
It's that Nanzheng is excellent.

471
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,640
She has always been excellent.

472
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,440
I don't think I'm good enough for her,

473
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,320
and I'm afraid she'll be
disappointed in the future.

474
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,240
Love

475
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,600
is to strive for and express.

[Information Technology Reconnaissance Bureau]

477
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,320
Comrade Deng Xiaoping

478
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,640
made many important speeches

479
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,520

The east wind blows, and
the eyes are full of spring scenery.

483
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,360
The story of this spring

484
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,240
has opened the prelude to

485
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,840
China's reform and opening up.

486
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,840
Since the introduction of
reform and opening up,

00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,520
within more than a decade,

488
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,040

developing positively and vigorously.

But my relationship with Gao Liang

495
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,480
stays exactly the same over the years.

496
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,400

497
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,200
running away from something.

00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,120
Thanks.

What about your plant?

502
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,640
How about I keep it for you?

503
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,400
I'll give it to you when you come back.

Do you get to call her Zheng?

00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,440
She told me to call her that.

513
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,880
Maybe you don't know

514
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,360
that I've been Zheng's boyfriend

00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,580
didn't I make it clear to you?

We're friends.

539
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,220
See?

00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,980
No matter how nice you are to her,

00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,860
as soon as she turns around,
you become a stranger,

542
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,260
a complete stranger.

543
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,100
What's the point?

544
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,140
Can you handle this kind of girl?

545
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,580
I'm telling you,

546
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,180
first, these girls are uncultivated,

00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,900
and second, they are unruly.

548

I've been dealing with her for years.

549
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,500
I'm used to it,

550
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,260
and I've been riddled with holes.

551
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,420
I've been through many battles
and my armor has been worn through.

552
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,780
You're going too far.

553
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,380
Learn something and you begin to be arrogant.

554
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,660
Just like this, can you stand it?

555
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,140
Why do we field forces

556
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,140
practice kung fu every day?

Who is your beloved?

When did I agree to be your beloved?

562
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,060
I'm telling you,

564
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:04,980
if one person looks like

565
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:05,860
your beloved,

566
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,260
sounds like your beloved,

567
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,460
and feels like your beloved,

568
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,860
then she must be the one,

569
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,500
right?

570
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,580
Get your hands off me.

571
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,260
I get it.

572
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,060
You are using me to express love for each other.

573
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,380
Gao Liang,

574
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,660
Nanzheng is strong on the outside

575
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,700
but fragile on the inside.

576
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,900
She needs a strong

577
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,460
and reliable man.

578
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,460
Aren't you talking about me?

579
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:40,940
Get out of here.

580
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,940
-Big blabber-mouth.
-Gao Liang.

581
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,900
My clothes and hat.

582
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,140
What are you doing?

583
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,380
He's my colleague.

584
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,380
Be polite.

585
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,500
I know.

586
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,820
Your colleague is very nice.

587
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,900
He's just too talkative.

588
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,940
He's nice.

589
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,540
Are you being jealous?

590
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,860
Of that guy?

591
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,140
Why should I?

592
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,900
He's specially recruited by our bureau,

593
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,140
with an IQ of 180.

594
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,580
I don't care about the IQ.

595
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,180
Even if he has an IQ of 250,
he's not the one for you,

596
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:19,980
okay?

597
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,940
So do you think

598
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,740
you're right one for me?

599
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,140
I'm better for you than he is.

600
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:33,860
Louder.

601
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,820
It's rare to help you pack,

602
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,060
and I won't see you for years this time.

603
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,740
But you can rest assured that

604
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,420
I will visit you often.

605
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,780
You can take in advanced knowledge there,

606
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,780
and I'll help you get rid of

607
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,100
all the tech guys around you.

608
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,100
Gao Liang,

609
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,420
you weren't like this before.

610
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,020
What was I like before?

611
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,020
You're questioning yourself.

612
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:56,940
You're not confident.

613
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,900
Why am I not confident?

614
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,340
I'm asking you.

615
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,180
Want to take this book with you?

616
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,940
Don't try to change the subject.

617
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,220
You know what I mean.

618
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,180
Answer me!

619
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,780
How long are you going to avoid it?

620
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,380
I'm asking you.

621
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,220
I'm not avoiding, I...

622
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,740
I'm not.

623
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,620
I just

624
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,300
don't think I'm good enough right now.

625
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,020
What do you mean not good enough?

626
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,580
Which aspect is not good enough?

627
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,100
Don't you like me?

628
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,180
Say something. Look me in the eye.

629
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,580
I don't know.

630
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,500
Just go.

631
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,500
Leave and never come to me again.

632
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,220
I won't wait for you anymore.

633
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,660
I don't want you anymore.

634
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,860
Bad Gao Liang.

635
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,460
Have you really thought this through?

636
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,620
Company Commander.

637
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,780
Silly girl,

638
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,100
still call me Company Commander?

639
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,220
I'm the Lieutenant Colonel.

640
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,780
Company Commander is the closest name.

641
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,740
Recruit Comrade Jiang Nanzheng,

642
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,020
tell me,

643
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,740
why are you crying?

644
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,700
Company Commander.

645
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,700
That's okay.

646
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:07,900
Why are you here?

647
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,700
Are you trying to get away from me?

648
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,620
I...

649
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,980
I want to be alone.

650
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,340
The bed is clean,

651
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,180
the shoes are shiny,

652
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,700
and the clothes are neat,

653
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,620
which means you're still calm.

654
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,580
But,

655
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,700
you forgot one thing.

656
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,540
You said

657
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,820
you're going to propose to me

658
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,300
after the maneuvers.

659
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,620
I'm still waiting.

660
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,860
I was demoted,

661
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,220
but I got your heart.

662
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,380
God is so kind to me.

663
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,180
I can't believe it's true.

664
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:11,020
In fact, this heart has always been there.

665
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,420
It's just that you focus on

666
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,660
something else

667
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,580
and couldn't feel it.

668
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,460
Chunyu,

669
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,900
please give me some time.

670
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,100
I have to think it over.

671
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,220
Xia Lin,

672
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,020
didn't you

673
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,020
think clearly

674
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,540
before you told me

675
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,620
that you want to pursue me

676
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,980
and confess your love to me?

677
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:48,620
Yes, I did.

678
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,100
But I need a real victory.

679
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,140
I want to defeat Gao Liang.

680
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,980
Otherwise, I can't convince myself.

681
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,660
There's no big deal

682
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,620
to hear you say so.

683
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,180
It depends on

684
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,580
what you think.

685
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,860
Do you think

686
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,300
you can let him go?

687
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,900
I tried,

688
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,180
but I can't.

689
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,380
That's it.

690
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,420
Tell him

691
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,380
you love him.

692
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,540
I can't say it.

693
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:29,860
Why?

694
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,500
He knows I have a thing for him,

695
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,260
and he's been avoiding me.

696
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,460
Besides,

697
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,460
he used to pursue me.

698
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,620
He took the initiative.

699
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,220
Can't you pursue him once?

700
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,180
Where is the courage that

701
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,700
you risked everything

702
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,100
to pursue Gu Yiye?

703
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,020
I think

704
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,540
maybe I've been hurt,

705
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,020
so, I'm scared.

706
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,780
Being scared

707
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,260
because of love.

708
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,380
Being scared or hesitated?

709
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,580
Are you scared that Gao Liang

710
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,580
will fail you

711
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,620
like Gu Yiye did?

712
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,660
He won't.

713
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,060
He won't fail me.

714
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,740
Why are you so sure?

715
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,420
So, that means,

716
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,740
you are too proud

717
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,420
to get married to Gao Liang,

718
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,220
right?

719
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,940
If you're scared, be brave.

720
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,540
Listen to me,

721
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,220
enjoy the sweetness now.

722
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,060
Before you get married,

723
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,340
being in love is so wonderful.

724
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,820
After you take the vows,

725
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,220
lots of things

726
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,340
will change.

727
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,420
Is it true?

728
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,340
You may not believe

729
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,060
whatever others say

730
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,580
if not experiencing it yourself.

731
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,140
Company Commander, how have you been lately?

732
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,580
Rapid response is close to an end, isn't it?

733
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,500
Yes.

734
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,380
The contingent will withdraw first tomorrow.

735
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,900
Have you recovered well from the abortion?

736
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:28,740
See?

737
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,620
Even you concerns about me.

738
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:32,780
But he...

739
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,020
Never mind. Enough about me.

740
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,220
Tell me something about you.

741
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,140
When are you leaving for school?

742
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,860
The trains leaves tomorrow afternoon.

743
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,020
Nanzheng,

744
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,860
I am truly happy for you

745
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,380
having the opportunity
for further study with subjects.

746
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,500
Listen,

747
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,860
no matter for your beloved ones,

748
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,140
or for your business,

749
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,940
never give up easily

750
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,660
even facing with

751
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,300
difficulties or misunderstandings.

752
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,140
It's easy for a girl

753
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,980
to dawdle away her time in the army.

754
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,100
However, to accomplish remarkable things,

755
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,060
girls have to pay a much greater price than guys,

756
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,540
even for our beloved ones.

757
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,380
That's not fair.

758
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,700
Yeah,

759
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,660
that's not fair.

760
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,500
Sometimes, even if
we are aware of the unfairness,

761
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,500
we have to be persistent whatsoever,

762
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,460
because we know that

763
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,740
one day,

764
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,860
we will be proud of

765
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,980
what we have accomplished.

766
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,820
The road is in front of us.

767
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:41,940
We have to keep moving on

768
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,580
no matter what,

769
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,340
right?

770
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,860
Faster! Run!

771
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,060
Keep it up!

772
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,380
Chest to the ground!

773
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:05,820
Colonel,

774
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,100
in the last three months,

775
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,300
the Ninth Company has
lost for three times in a row

776
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,740
on the training ground.

777
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,260
First to Night Tiger Company of Regiment 700,

778
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,620
then to Iron Sixth Company of Regiment 702,

779
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,700
and last, to the First Company of our Regiment.

780
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,820
Is it acceptable?

781
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,580
Fake model fell down,

782
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,620
you have no back-ups now.

783
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,500
The former advanced teams

784
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,580
will definitely take this opportunity
and get it back on you.

785
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,860
They'll get it back. But what about me?

786
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,780
I'm pissed off!

787
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,220
What's the point of that anyway?

788
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,140
Being the Company Commander,
you must think of something.

789
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:41,900
Colonel,

790
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,380
I've come up with a plan.

791
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,660
And that's the only way.

792
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,700
We'll become the Trash Company again.

793
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,340
How?

794
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,740
Jiang Weixing is now

795
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,620
writing articles for
Publicity Unit of Regiment 700.

796
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,020
And Niu Mancang

797
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,980
is the administrator in the Administration
and Registration Section of Division Headquarter.

798
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,820
These two have not changed a bit,

799
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,660
and are still troublesome.

800
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,020
They must be transferred back here.

801
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,140
Hey, you!

802
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,220
Hold it!

803
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,660
Sergeant, keep an eye on them!

804
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,260
You really talk big,

805
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,179
asking for transferring two officers

806
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,820
from other units.

807
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,659
Do you think it's easy to transfer personnel?

808
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:16,900
I'm not Division Commander.

809
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:17,980
Colonel,

810
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,620
I'm not transferring personnel.

811
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,820
I'm transferring the work style
of the former Ninth Company.

812
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,020
Without those big bullies,

813
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,420
how can we revive the domineering Ninth Company?

814
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:28,500
Colonel.

815
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:30,580
Colonel, I...

816
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,340
Okay.

817
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,980
I'll go to the Division Headquarter
tomorrow and deal with it.

818
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:36,060
If the Ninth Company would not change a bit

819
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,900
after I manage to transfer them here,

820
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,139
I'll not let you off.

821
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:40,780
Yes, sir!

822
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:46,739
Run!

00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,580
Jiang Weixing,

826
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,980
you don't want the job anymore, do you?

827
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,260
That's exactly right!

00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,860

830
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:22,980
What brings you here?

831
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,380
How dare you

832
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,580
talk back to Section Chief?

833
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,260
So what he's Section Chief?

834
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,420
I will talk back to Colonel

835
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,340
as long as I'm right!

836
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,260
You're indeed comfortable now.

837
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,180
But you don't want to get promoted anymore, do you?

838
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,380
Better be a centurion

839
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,900
than a scholar.

840
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,460
I'm here to be a soldier,

841
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,700
rather than an ass-kisser.

842
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,220
What are you smelling?

843
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,780
Are you crazy?

844
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,420
The smell of big bully.

845
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,140
Big, authentic bully of the Ninth Company.

846
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,500
What?

847
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,220
Do you come here to make fun of me in my evil days?

848
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,940
Seeing your miserable life here,

849
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,420
I'm here to pick you up to Regiment 720.

850
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,460
Why would I go back there?

851
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,340
Writing papers again?

852
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,140
Didn't Song Jianshe hire

853
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,020
several writers these two years?

854
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:08,140
I know nothing but telling the truth.

855
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,300
What's the use of me going back?

856
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,140
Song Jianshe has been transferred.

00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,860
Our former Company Commander

858
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,100
has come back to be the Colonel now.

859
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,460
He's been transferred?

860
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,580
I'm working on the reportage lately,

861
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,460
and didn't pay much attention

862
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,700
to the personnel change in our Division.

863
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,620
I'll replace your reportage with this.

864
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:39,500
Transferring me back
to Regiment 720 to be a Commissar?

865
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,820
How does a promotion sound like?

866
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,860
I'm an artist,

867
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,820
a man with enthusiasm.

868
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,860
Things like welfare and promotion

869
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,460
mean nothing to me.

870
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,180
However,

871
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,980
I'll go back with you,

872
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,900

873
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,260
Never mind the enthusiasm.

00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,060
That's easy.

00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,980
Niu can be the Commissar.

876
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,620
And you can go back and raise pigs.

877
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,540
You can pay no respect to art,

878
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,940
but not to enthusiasm.

879
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,300

which we have raised for eight years,

884
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,580

Report, Chief!

896
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,780
One month is not enough.

897
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,500
One month

898
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,580

899
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:50,340

902
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,620
It's difficult for us

904
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,580
No more excuses!

905
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,300
What?

906
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,260
Are you just eager to win, but afraid of losing?

907
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,620
Report, Chief!

908
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,660
The Ninth Company claims the tasks!

909
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,340
We will beat the night tigers

910
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,660

911
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,740
Old friends,

912
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,740
are you ready to be beaten up?

913
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,100
We're ready to beat you up.

914
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,100
Only two squads of ours

915
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,940
beat you up

916
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,740

917
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,460
This time, it's one whole Company instead.

918
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,060
I'll take down the Commander first.

919
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,780
Do you have too much energy to consume?

920
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,780
Don't use them against me.
Go find Jiang Nanzheng.

921
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,780
Are you unconvinced?

922
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,620
What are you doing? Come on!

923
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,460
Take down the enemy's officer.

924
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,140
Go!

925
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:40,420
I give up.

926
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,620
Give up. Okay.

927
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,100
Alright, time to talk business.

928
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:46,740

You are?

930
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,140
When?

931
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,820
After the competition.

932
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,580
Fine.

933
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,060
After the competition,

934
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,620
we'll throw you a nice ceremony.

935
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:00,820
Never mind.

936
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,220
Xiu will not like it.

937
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,540
She said that we would hold a small ceremony

938
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,180
for our bros and friends

939
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,100
getting together.

940
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,460
Nonsense!

941
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,540
How can you have a small ceremony?

942
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,660
Marriage is a big thing.

943
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,740
You'll have nothing but a great ceremony.

944
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,660
You know Xiu well.

945
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,620
And I don't like the crowds, either.

946
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:18,820
Just a small ceremony

947
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,060
for our acquaintances.

948
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:23,620
Right,

949
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,620
a new information.

950
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,580
This will not be a small competition.

951
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:27,700
The unit who wins

952
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,300
will be considered as

953
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,980
the pilot unit for the new unit.

954
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,860
What kind of new unit can Infantry have?

955
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,660
Rapid Response Unit.

956
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,180
Since you didn't keep your secret,

957
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,060
I'll disclose some information to you as well.

958
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,220
There will be foreign armies

959
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,700
joining this competition.

960
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:00,620
Mule,

961
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,180
we're talking about your
Night Tiger Company here,

962
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,940
instead of other Companies.

963
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,820
You are cruel!

964
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,340
Such a cold-blooded animal!

965
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,700
According to the rules of the maneuvers,

966
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,540
Night Tiger Company is led by Mena Suvari

967
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,900
that is the foreign armies.

968
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,380
We are

969
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,100
the comrades-in-arms in the same trench.

970
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,540
We will either quit it,

971
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,060
or take part in it

972
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,500
for real.

973
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,820
You are such an animal.

974
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:30,940
But I like it.

975
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:31,900
Come on.

976
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,500
Thanks for the compliment.

977
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,220
Take cover! Watch out!

978
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,780
Take cover!

979
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:34,660
Withdraw!

980
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:35,700
Withdraw!

981
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,460
Hurry up!

982
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,700
Follow up! Follow up! Keep up!

983
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,900
Your army has stepped into the mind field.

984
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,180
Out!

985
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:13,060
[Operational Zone Map of Army A]

986
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,740
Is foreign army just like that?

987
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,860
Special forces are nowhere special.

988
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:18,140
The basic skills of their officers
are even inferior to

989
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,100
our Training Units with stronger infantries.

990
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,380
The Light Infantry of our army
is the best around the world.

991
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,460
This sentence will not be out-dated

992
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,140
even after all these years.

993
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:30,620
Army Commander,

994
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,220
if the skills of the foreign army are just like that,

995
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,060
we have nothing to learn from them.

996
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,220
We all have our strong points and weak points.

997
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,940
Can the Scout do the stitch-work well?

998
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:39,820
Can you?

999
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,420
Watch them closely.

1000
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,380
Next is

1001
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,060
Stimulation Drilling of Reverse Hijacking Tactic.

1002
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,740
It requires personnel cooperation.

1003
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,940
There will be a group of five coaches
from the foreign army.

1004
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,780
You elect five officers as well.

1005
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:54,580
Report!

1006
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:55,580
I'll go!

1007
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:56,940
Report, me!

1008
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,420
Report, I'll go!

1009
00:42:59,020 --> 00:42:59,620
Report!

1010
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,940
I'll wait and see.
