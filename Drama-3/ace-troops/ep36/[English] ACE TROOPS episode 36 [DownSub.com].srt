00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,550
Chief.

191
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,620
Chief.

192
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,140
The accommodation is ready,

193
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,900
chief, please go and have a rest.

194
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,340
Chief won't go.

195
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,280
He worries about our shore artillery positions

196
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,500
and thinks we have placed it in the wrong place.

197
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,820
Captain.

198
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,740
The shore artillery positions are set here

199
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,250
with a good view.

200
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:33,220
By the way.

201
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,340
I thought we have made a deal not to intervene.

202
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,250
You should keep your promise.

203
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,150
Gao Liang.

204
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:36,980
Sir.

205
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:41,140
Do you really want to put the shore artillery here?

206
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:41,789
Yes.

207
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,570
We don't intervene

208
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,780
and give you the power, but look how you have used it.

209
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,980
Not to mention 48 hours,

210
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,340
you cannot withhold for even

211
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,480
48 minutes.

212
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,240
Captain,

213
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,520
it is true that it is quite conspicuous

214
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,480
to place the shore artillery here.

215
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,000
But I have also set up some

216
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,580
powerful insurance measures.

217
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,780
I am sure

218
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,320
the Red Army

219
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,740
will not dare to point its finger in this place.

220
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,070
Gao Liang,

221
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,740
what do you mean?

222
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,980
Chief.

223
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,860
In fact,

224
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,660
you are with the observation team.

225
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,480
So according to the regulation of the drill,

226
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,460
I can't tell you about the details.

227
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,900
But to be frank,

228
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,180
the observation posts of the chiefs

229
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,780
are just behind this place.

230
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,460
It is less than 100 meters from here.

231
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,780
So I place the shore artillery here.

232
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,900
Gu Yiye will never have the guts

233
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,020
to blow this place.

234
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,420
So you want to use the observation team as the shield, right?

235
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,940
But don't forget.

236
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,620
Although we use the

237
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,660
laser simulation countermeasure system now,

238
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,980
the fireworks

239
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,420
can still hurt people.

240
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,340
You have placed all these chiefs

241
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,240
in danger.

242
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,680
If something happens, who can bear the responsibility?

243
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,620
Captain Qin,

244
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,660
this is your fault.

245
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,740
The most important thing is that you have cheated.

246
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,100
Li,

247
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,660
this is not cheating.

248
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,140
Qin, don't fool with me.

249
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,780
Gao Liang, let me just ask you this.

250
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,880
Do you have any idea

251
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,140
of respecting the cadres and love your soldiers?

252
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,620
In thirty minutes,

253
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,180
move 300 meters back.

254
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,020
This is the oder.

255
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,240
Captain.

256
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,100
Gao Liang.

257
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,220
You really don't want to relocate your shore artillery?

258
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,100
Chief.

259
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,300
Yes.

260
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,460
Really?

261
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,340
Yes.

262
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,820
Then don't change it.

263
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,480
Chief.

264
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,800
I think it is a good idea

265
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,900
to place the shore artillery here.

266
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,300
You should let him command.

267
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,540
Don't intervene.

268
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,860
You should mind your own business.

269
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,540
Chief.

270
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,360
You are making the promise again.

271
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,300
I am the only commander here on the island.

272
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,500
The observation team will not intervene in

273
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,080
anything.

274
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,780
How can we take back what we said.

275
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,660
All orders on this island

276
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,460
will come from you.

277
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,220
You don't need to mind us.

278
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,300
Bring the food and drink

279
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,100
to the observation team

280
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,060
and go fight your war.

281
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,100
Yes.

282
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,140
Thank you, Chief.

283
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,100
Chief.

284
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,920
This way please.

285
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,910
Chief.

286
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,660
The safety problem is a major issue.

287
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,180
If we don't intervene,

288
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,740
if anything happens...

289
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,860
If nothing happens,

290
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,580
how can we know where problems will occur?

291
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,780
If we talk about safety all day,

292
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,580
how can we conduct military drills

293
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,140
and how can we strengthen our army?

294
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,000
But...

295
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,740
But what? Qin Hanyong,

296
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,340
you really think Gao Liang means what he said?

297
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,740
Do you really think he is going to use us as the shield?

298
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,500
How dare he?

299
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,440
But, just now...

300
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,660
No more buts.

301
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,100
With so many people here, no one noticed it.

302
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,140
Just go and touch it.

303
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,180
Touch the oil on the artillery.

304
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,980
Is this real artillery?

305
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,260
It is just a camouflage.

306
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,700
The whole shore artillery is camouflaged.

307
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,480
Gao Liang's shore artillery position

308
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,020
is not even here.

309
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,220
A group of captains

310
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,900
pretend to be teachers and lecture others.

311
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,600
Gao Liang gets the scores

312
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,900
with his first move.

313
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,460
Seventeen objects on the island,

314
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,340
nearly half of them are fake.

315
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,820
He is messing with us.

316
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,500
The important point is not on the known targets.

317
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,820
Gao Liang is not a cook.

318
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,980
He will not place the fire points in the spotlight

319
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,140
for us to get rid of.

320
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,100
Now we have to find a way

321
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,940
to figure out his real intention.

322
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,460
Otherwise we will definitely be in a disadvantaged situation

323
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,020
when we get on the island.

324
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,740
How is

325
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,780
the deployment

326
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,780
of the Blue Army's coordinated operations?

327
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,500
The intelligence is all collected,

328
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,180
and we are making the defense plan.

329
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,460
Defense?

330
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,420
Be clear of our identity.

331
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,780
We are attacking and they are defending.

332
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,100
At the first sound of the gunshot,

333
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,380
I want the Special Operations Battalion to know

334
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,620
what it means to sit still waiting for death

335
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,300
and what it means to be beaten up.

336
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,160
No, no, no.

337
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,520
No regrets.

338
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,840
You are fooling with us.

339
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:54,580
[Idea Map of "Operation Azure" Island Capture Drill]

340
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,900
You are fooling with us.

341
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,020
You already started playing.

342
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,500
Your sister-in-law Hongyan brought something to us.

343
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,020
What is it?

344
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,660
Here, have a try.

345
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:00,930
Sure.

346
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,540
Chief.

347
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,080
What is the director department doing?

348
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,040
We have so many chiefs here.

349
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,950
They didn't even arrange some officials for us.

350
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:08,960
And we have to run errands ourselves.

351
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,900
Yes.

352
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,520
Here.

353
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,000
Let's keep playing.

354
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,680
Keep playing.

355
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,320
Go, go.

356
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,440
The director group of Red and Blue Army in Operation Azure.

357
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,120
I am the General Director He Zhigeng.

358
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,400
The commanders of both Red and Blue Army, please adjust your time.

359
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,880
Now it is the 15th.

360
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,200
58 past 23.

361
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,660
The drill will begin in two minutes.

362
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,700
Repeat.

363
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,360
The director department will offer no further notice.

364
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,820
The drill will begin in two minutes automatically.

365
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,380
The show starts.

366
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,500
Apart from the air defense post and the observation post,

367
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,140
everyone gets down to the bunker.

368
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,900
Tell them to block their ears

369
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,420
and get a good sleep.

370
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,700
What should we do about the observation team?

371
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,460
They like to see the noisy hilarity.

372
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,900
So let them stay there

373
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,120
and listen to the shore artillery.

374
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,460
Inform the drill director department.

375
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,100
Tell them that

376
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,040
there is no fire point from me

377
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,500
within 100 meters around the observation team.

378

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,180
In your view,

485
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,790
our army does not deserve to be

00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,120

487
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,820
We are not that bad.

488
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,500
Right.

489
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,180
I have considered this as well.

490
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,700

491
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,840

492
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,300
it must conduct bold innovation.

493
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,180
We have to let the younger generation

494
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,900

00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,680

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,100

00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,300
Spread out and search.

500
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,420
Yes.

501
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,700
The two planes we shot down are

502
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,620

503
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,180
We have caught the pilots.

504
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,800
Their mission is to

505
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,780
observe the battle situation of the Red Commando

506
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,060
and report to the red command post in real time.

507
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,420
They need three observation planes?

508
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,540
It is the first strike and also a raid.

509
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,100
It means a lot to the battle.

510
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,630
We didn’t use our major force.

511
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,420
If we had used…

512
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,640
What if one plane ran off among the three?

513
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,080
Then they will know

514
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,940
the deployment of troops on the island.

515
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,740
I think something was wrong.

516
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,220
What?

517
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,760
If you want to have a sneak attack, you will definitely choose

518
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,860
a time when defenses are more slack.

519
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,260
But as soon as the director team said the time began,

520
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,620
he started to attack.

521
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,860
There are so many defenders on our island

522
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,100
and heavy weapons.

523
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,940
They only sent 26 people.

524
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,700
They are intended to be killed.

525
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,340
If you say so,

526
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,300

00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,420

529
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,420
The two powered hang gliders that were shot down are in your hands.

530
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,880
Did the plane that have an emergency landing give off smoke?

531
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,860
No.

532
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,080
It can continue to fight.

533
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,260
No smoke.

534
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,220
So,

535
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,140
he made a forced landing on purpose.

536
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,700
Hurry up and contact Niu

537
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,660

540
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,300
He hid in the dark.

541
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,920
and stunned Niu.

542
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,420
He then pulled him into the powered hang glider

543
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,380
and flew off.

544
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,460
A bird with a broken wing

545
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,480
can take Niu away from

547
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,940
The terrain in that place is particularly dangerous,

548
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,600
and it is impossible for a hang glider to land safely.

549
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,900
But he did make it.

550
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,540
Did you see the pilot?

551
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,520
No.

552
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,460
But I guess

553
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,700
it is the King of the gliders, Dao Xiaohui

554
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,020
Did Niu give off smoke?

555
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,580
Yes, he did. But got captured anyway.

556
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,160
You should shoot him down

557
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,620
if he was captured

558
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,900

The elimination rate is as high as 80%.

00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,340
Gu, Gu, Gu.

755
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,800
Are you serious? Gu, Gu Yiye.

756
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,860
Gu Yiye, what are you doing?

757
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:41,900
Commander.

758
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,960
Taking him down from the hang glider

759
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,780
really caused him a lot of trouble.

760
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,420
He is stubborn, he will not tell.

761
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,700
If he really tells,

762
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,140
he is about to transfer to civilian work.

763
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,180
Actual combat drill

764
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,060
needs to look like an actual combat.

765
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,380
Dao Xiaohui,

766
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,020
I am not expecting him to tell,

767
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,700
I just want him to stay in tense.

768
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,460
The tighter, the better.

769
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,420
Yes.

770
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,020
Lightly.

771
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,220
Don't cause any internal injuries.

772
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,260
If his wife wants to divorce him,

773
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,380
I won't spare you.

774
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,900
Gu Yiye.

775
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:12,920
Gu Yiye.

776
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,860
I am about to have my second child, Gu Yiye.

777
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,160
Tell me, how did I

778
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,420
teach someone like you?

779
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:18,820
Qin Hanyou.

780
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,420
Will you stop?

781
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,300
If you want to make an conclusion,

783
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,140
do it

784
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,740
after the drill.

785
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,540
You don't even think about the situation.

786
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,180
Chief is here.

787
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,500
Can not you see how Regiment 700 fights?

788
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,800
They are doing continuous attack.

789
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,720
There's a line waiting for you in the back,

790
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,100
and he won't let you get a good night's sleep.

791
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,940
Can't you do it flexibly?

792
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,080
What are you doing with your weapons?

793
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,340
What is it for to bury them in the soil?

794
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,460
To hatch eggs?

795
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,600
Can't you organize a counter-offensive operation?

796
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,780
Take them out of the reef.

797
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,660
Are you waiting for them to catch your turtle?

798
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,540
Captain.

799
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,460
Who is commanding?

800
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,040
You.

801
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,820
Qin Hanyong.

802
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,300
Are you here to report to the observation team?

803
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,500
Chief.

804
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,260
Now,

805
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,780
this is called...

806
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,700
Yes. Change of words.

807
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,420
Notify the observation team.

808
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,060
Yes.

809
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,660
Tell me.

810
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,200
I would like to give a briefing

811
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,620
to the chiefs of the observation team.

812
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,960
I hope the chiefs of the observation team

813
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,740
can save water and food.

814
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,590
My soldiers are going back and forth.

815
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,100

I... it's my first time to participate in the drill.

827
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,700
and I got captured.

828
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,260
When I become soldier again in future, what should I tell others?

829
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,420
This is so embarrassing.

830
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,300
No, this is not embarrassing at all.

831
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,620
Firstly, this is just a training subject.

832
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,380
And moreover, we have completed our mission.

833
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,460
We successively brought the eaglet here.

834
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,300
We are the heroes of the Red Army.

835
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,820
A bunch of idiots.

836
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,260
Who is there?

837
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,420
The Red Army is really strange.

838
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,040
They marched forward three times in the morning.

839
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,900
Aren’t they afraid of having their lives shortened?

840
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,500
Have we calculated the life loss?

841
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,580
72 people.

842
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,300
Half of them were left in the tidal flats.

843
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,740
Half were killed by the enemy’s power on the sea.

844
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,900
It really cost them a lot to hit me.

845
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,060
We have searched the whole island

846
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,660
but we did not see anyone.

847
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,260
The captives' confession might be wrong.

848
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,220
Commander.

849
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,480
One fishing boat says that due to mechanical failure,

850
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,440
it asked for docking.

851
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,200
I thought we have agreed to seal the sea and the air.

852
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,260
Where did the fishing boat come from?

853
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,100
Tell them that no docking is allowed.

854
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,780
Already docked.

855
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,140
It is an order issued by the observation team.

856
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,940
These old men.

857
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,420
They have agreed not to interfere in the drill.

858
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,420
Who let the ship dock?

859
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,020
Who?

860
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,660
Who gave the order?

861
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:16,580
Gao Liang,

862
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,700
the villager’s fishing boat was caught in waves at sea.

863
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,880
The fishing boat lost power

864
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,460
and floated here in the wind.

865
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,420
If you don’t let them get on the island, you want to drive them to the sea?

866
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,840
Moreover, the military-civilian relationship

867
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,500
is a good tradition of our troop.

868
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,550
We can‘t abandon this

869
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,700
just for a drill.

870
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,440
I can not think of traditions now.

871
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,460
I am in a war.

872
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,780
Qin,

873
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,780
did you see?

874
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,150
The soldiers in your Special Operations Battalion,

875
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,680
they forget

876
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,380
whom do they wear this military uniform for.

877
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,220
Anyway, let's put it aside.

878
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:50,980
Let them get off the ship.

879
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,680
No, I am in a war.

880
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,590
Enough!

881
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,640
Song is right.

882
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,580
Why do you fight in wars?

883
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,220
Isn’t it just for the ordinary people?

884
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,220
Moreover, this is just a drill.

885
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,140
There is no need to destroy the military-civilian relationship.

886
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,380
Alright, get off the ship.

887
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,460
Let’s get off the boat.

888
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,139
Alright, let's get off.

889
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,500
Brothers of the People's Liberation Army, do you have a pit?

890
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,900
I want to take a shit.

891
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,429
We don’t have anything to eat.

892
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,730
Give us some vegetables.

893
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,500
We only have rice and noodles.

894
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,620
Won’t the PLA give us a little?

895
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,060
Don’t try to play with me.

896
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,460
Capture them!

897
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,380
Yes.

898
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,290
Sir.

899

[Idea Map of "Operation Azure" Island Capture Drill]

901
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,620
I request the observation team

902
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,020
to get off the island now.

903
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,620
Gao Liang.

904
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,380
Don't act on impulse.

905
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,100
It’s fine if you don’t leave the island.

906
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,659
I will inform the drill director

907
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,320
that the Blue Army admits failure and surrenders.

908
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,060
We can’t fight this war.

00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,380
what do you want to do?

What do I want to do?

912
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,620
What are you doing?

913
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,300
You have agreed to leave the authority to me.

914
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,470
Do you really give me the power?

915
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,960
You give orders and change my plan again and again.

Gao Liang.

919
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,500
It is the observation team's fault

920
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,740
to let the fishermen get on the island.

921
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,440
This won’t happen again.

922
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,140

00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,420
and follows the principles.

925
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,420
Even if all our soldiers are defeated and killed,

926
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,180
we have to leave

928
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,160
Right?

929
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,420
This is true.

930
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,800
This is true.

931
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,900
But are they real fishermen?

932
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,320
Have you seen a boat of fishermen with

933
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,960
all young men in their twenties?

934
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,100
A group of people with flat heads and

935
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:39,880
speak in

936
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,720
Sichuan dialect and Hunan dialect?

937
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,140
Is there any sea in Sichuan and Hunan provinces?

938
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,520
They were sent by the Red Army

to disrupt the defense system on my island.

940
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,020
They sent me some civilians

941
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,300
to consume food and fresh water on my island.

942
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,660
Fools can see it.

943
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,300
I can deal with all these.

944
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,000
But if the Red Army and the observation team

945
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,140
continue to make trouble,

946
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,860
I can’t fight this battle.

947
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,940
No distinction between authorities.

948
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,020
This is

949
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,620
the mistake of our observation team

950
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,900
and also my mistake.

951
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,380
I promise you

952
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,940
there will be no such problems in the future.

953
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,300
Chief,

954
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,500
can I say something aloud?

955
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,020
Yes.

956
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,020
What can you do to guarantee?

957
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,460
My soldiers are desperately guarding the island here.

958
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,680
You just eat and drink here

959
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,340
and give orders out of your own will.

960
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,940
How will you change? And how can I believe?

961
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,660
Gao Liang.

962
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,380
You don’t know who you are after the drill.

963
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,680
Gao Liang.

964
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,740
You didn't mean it, right?

965
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,300
He didn't mean it.

966
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,500
He didn't mean it.

967
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,180
Gao Liang,

968
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,540
you know it even if I don't say it.

969
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,440
The significance of the drill is

970
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,780
not only in the grassroots army,

971
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,180
but also,

972
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,500
in the effective operation of the command system.

973
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,140
The observation team cannot go off the island.

974
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,700
You tell me.

975
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,420
How can I make you believe us?

976
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,540
The observation team

977
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,460
should change the identity.

978
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,380
How can we change the identity?

979
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:28,940
Hostage.

980
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,360
Is there something

981
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,820
wrong with your head?

982
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:32,900
Sir.

983
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,520
Commander.

984
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,240
Three fishing boats were found five nautical miles away.

985
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,400
They sent a distress signal,

986
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,340
saying that there is something wrong with the boats

987
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,740
and requested to get on the island.

988
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,980
Did you see?

989
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,420
Again.

990
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,180
Tell them

991
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,900
to turn around immediately.

992
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,180
If they dare to continue to drive into Qiaotou Island,

993
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,080
we will send air-explosive bomb,

994
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,060
fifty meters to the ship.

995
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,100
Fishing boats are absolutely not allowed to land on the island.

996
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,900
Yes.

997
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,540
Li Shaobing,

998
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,060
is this really your Regiment 700?

999
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,240
Will this ever end? You play this despicable trick

1000
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,480
over and over again.

1001
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,920
Why don’t you just change to the reserve force?

1002
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,800
How do you know

1003
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,820
it is the Regiment 700?

1004
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,860
Alright, if it is,

1005
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,760
then what?

1006
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,760
There can never be too much deception in war.

1007
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,580
Is it wrong?

1008
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,620
Come on, Chief.

1009
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,480
How can it be like this?

1010
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,020
Gao Liang really can’t fight in this war.

1011
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,180
What’s wrong is not about

1012
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,940
the two sides in this battle.

1013
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,220
But

1014
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,300
about their head office.

1015
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,640
Notify drill director department.

1016
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,220
Tell them it’s my opinion.

1017
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,380
The observation team will change the identity.

1018
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,220
We will stay on the island as hostages.

1019
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,280
Come on.

1020
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,180
Chief.

1021
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,460
As hostages,

1022
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,580
we have no rights to give orders.

1023
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,180
But,

1024
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,540
we will keep our rights

1025
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,260
to observe the drill.

1026
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,340
Sure.

1027
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,540
Someone.

1028
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,980
Turn right.

1029
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,860
From now on,

1030
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,060
the identity of the observation team

1031
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,660
is changed to hostages.

1032
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,460
Take them to the bunker and lock them up.

1033
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,540
Yes.

1034
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,220
Gao Liang.

1035
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,300
This is not necessary.

1036
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,060
Chiefs, please.

1037
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,220
I said

1038
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,140
we only change our identity,

1039
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,100
we still have the rights to observe the drill.

1040
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,740
You should select a representative.

1041
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,900
I will communicate directly with the representative.

1042
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,660
Every link and detail of this drill

1043
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,940
will be reported.

1044
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:22,820
Take them away.

1045
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,020
Chiefs, please.

1046
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:27,890
Let’s go.

1047
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,100
I am sorry, Chiefs.

1048
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,460
For the drill,

1049
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,420
I have to use this tactic.

1050
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,700
How's the fishermen team doing?

1051
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:43,730
They were kicked off the island four hours after landing.

1052
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,600
The Blue Army filled their water cabinets

1053
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,180
and gave them two days' food.

1054
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,620
The other three boats failed to get on the island.

1055
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,220
In this daylight,

1056
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,980
I didn’t expect them to land on the island successfully.

1057
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,140
Let’s do this.

1058
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,620
At one o'clock in the morning,

1059
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,380
send another boat to the island.

1060
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,540
Tell everyone on the boat.

1061
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,860
If the Blue Army

1062
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,820
refuses to let them get on the island,

1063
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,500
then they should abandon the boat and swim to the island.

1064
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,700
The Red Army has seriously violated the rules of the drill.

1065
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,220
Will the director department do something about this?

1066
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,160
Put civilians into the battlefield

1067
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,500
is against our army’s principle.

1068
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:15,940
But,

1069
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,060
the wars in the future

1070
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,140
are complex.

1071
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,620
The director department believes this tactic works.

1072
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,620
Fine.

1073
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,300
What will the observation team do?

1074
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,260
We do according to the Chief's idea.

1075
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,400
The director department agrees

1076
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,940
to turn the observation team members into hostages.

1077
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,470
The director group will

1078
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,320
pass on the information

1079
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,860
to the Red Army.

1080
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,720
The director department

1081
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,980
identifies those who get on the island

1082
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,220
as fishermen.

1083
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,100
But,

1084
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,750
their ships did break down.

1085
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,380
It will take some time to repair them.

1086
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,100
You should ensure their safety.

1087
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,180
Give them necessary supplies.

1088
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,460
Shameless.

1089
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,880
The integrity in this war

1090
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,260
is not that easy to guarantee.

1091
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,240
Gu Yiye used civilian-participation in the war.

1092
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,180
But Gao Liang

1093
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,500
also turned the chiefs to hostages.

1094
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,060
According to my understanding of Gao Liang,

1095
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,120
I am sure,

1096
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,540
he played a bitter trick with the chief.

1097
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,740
We can’t blame him.

1098
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,820
Regardless of who loses or wins this battle,

1099
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,140
the biggest gain is our Troop A.

1100
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,340
So the current situation is like

1101
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,820
two troubled gallbladders and a pile of experience.

1102
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,580
They are enough for us to stay busy in the next half-year.

1103
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,660
Sir.

1104
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,480
General director,

1105
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,480
the Red Army launched the forth attack

1106
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,780
onto Qiaotou Island

1107
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,560
and retreated again.

1108
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,740
They still couldn't land on the island.

1109
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,180
Are the residual obstacles at the beach head

1110
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,300
cleared?

1111
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,020
We opened several roads,

1112
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,790
cleared half of the obstacles on the sea.

1113
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:52,760
But this is useless,

1114
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,700
as soon as our people retreat

1115
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,380
they just made up the gap.

1116
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,940
How many beach mines are left for them?

1117
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,350
He must have fought a fake war.

1118
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:03,260
But he didn't take much advantage of it either.

1119
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,380
He lost quite a lot of people.

1120
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,540
It's still dawn.

1121
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,660
Shall we organize another charge

1122
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,180
before dark?

1123
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:12,860
No need.

1124
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,740
We took their whole day up.

1125
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,500
The eaglet is ready.

1126
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,380
Notify the supporting artillery soldiers.

1127
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,180
Ask them to hurry up and replenish the ammunition,

1128
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,420
and save the energy until tomorrow.

1129
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,820
Notify the troops.

1130
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:25,820
Take some rest.

1131
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,020
Get ready to go to the island tomorrow

1132
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:28,820
to catch the turtle.

1133
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:29,940
Yes.

1134
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,860
[Information Technology Reconnaissance Bureau]

1135
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,960
So there's no winner or loser now.

1136
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,580
Sir.

1137
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,540
Come in please.

1138
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,660
Chief.

1139
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,940
Miss Jiang from Mountain Net Number Two arrives.

1140
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,060
Come in please.

1141
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,140
Chief.

1142
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,420
You are finally here.

1143
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,740
The superiors notified me to check in before the drill.

1144
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,960
But the military command has a temporary duty,

1145
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,740
so I came here today.
