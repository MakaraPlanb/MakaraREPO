[Episode 26]

4
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,160
Welcome!

5
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,039
Yiye,

6
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,640
as the former

7
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,680
- commander of the Night Tiger Company,
- Left, right, left.

8
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,360
this is my first handshake with you,

9
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,640
the current Night Tiger Company commander.

10
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,039
To be exact,

11
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,600
it's the first handshake between

12
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,080
the 28th company commander

13
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,880
and the 32nd company commander.

14
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,680
Couldn't be more accurate.

15
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,400
This time your opponent is Gao Liang.

16
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,000
This should be interesting.

17
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,440
But I think that's why Army Commander Zheng

18
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,000
made such deployment.

19
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,640
Don't worry, sir.

20
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,720
Gao Liang just took office

21
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,840
and he was still not familiar with the situation.

22
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,720
Now the Ninth Company is bluffing.

23
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,160
However, we are

24
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,190
in a very good shape.

25
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,030
I will not show any mercy.

26
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,080
It's good to be confident.

27
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,800
But do not forget

28
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,640
you came from the Ninth Company.

29
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,040
Others may be afraid

30
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,400
of hurting feelings,

31
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,840
but I am not one of them.

32
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,680
And according to my knowledge of

33
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,440
Gao Liang, he isn’t, either.

34
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,640
It's good to be that way.

35
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,280
But I must remind you

36
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,079
that the Ninth Company has a solid foundation.

37
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,079
You need to take them seriously.

38
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:32,960
Sure.

39
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,720
You two company commanders,

40
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,200
let's catch up later.

41
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,440
What?

42
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,320
I am the colonel, he is the company commander.

43
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,520
Here is the thing.

44
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,600
The comrades
of the rapid response experiment group

45
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,400
of the military artillery will arrive soon.

46
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,560
They want to use the exercise as a chance

47
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,000
to test their previous research accomplishments.

48
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,320
This time the exercise arranged

49
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,520
by our army commander has a great influence

50
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,880
and brought them here.

51
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,200
You seem to feel extra cordial

52

seeing your old company commander.

53
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,960
Have you forgotten how I trained you?

54
00:02:59,079 --> 00:02:59,920
When I was a new recruit,

55
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,160
I was with my old company commander.

56
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,680
We have a special relationship.

57
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,280
Fine.

Turn right.

Let's be more careful
and not bother them.

83
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,480
How's Xiu?

84
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,760
She's fine.

85
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,000
She attends the evening college

86
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,240
and takes cooking lessons.

87

Your choice back then
has influenced many people.

93

That's it. Enough talking about me.

94

How are you and Battalion Commander Xia?

95
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,120
He's quite lucky to have you.

96
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,600
You do think highly of me.

97

In fact,

98
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,400
Xia Lin is also excellent.

117
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,160
getting further away from us.

We've only seen each other once for a long time.

123
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,960
Hurry up and give me back my girlfriend!

If they get in,

195
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,280
once the artillery positions of Regiment 720 moves,

196
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,520
we will have a chance to spot it

197
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,400
and shoot it down.

198
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:38,680
Hold on,

199
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,600
our troops have traveled long distance

200
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,920
and it's too hard to

201
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,080
launch continuous attack.

202
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,200
Can we still hold on?

203
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,560
No problem!

204
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,520
We just had a victory,

205
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,560

206

Well,

209
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,400

210
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,440

211
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,080

212
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,840

213
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,040

214
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:57,600
Yes!

215

Sir,

216
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,280
are you going to give Regiment 720 up?

217
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,360
In my opinion, Position 501

218
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,200
was given to us by Regiment 700.

219
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,600
We got this position not because

220
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,000
the Ninth Company have destroyed

221
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,600
their defense.

222
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,480
It's a trap they set up.

223
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:18,880

224
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,640

226
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,000
After our Highland 501

227
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,400
was taken by Regiment 720,

228
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,680
they did not continue their attack.

229
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,280
If they won't

230
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,760
fall into the trap,

231
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,880
it could be a problem.

232
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,880
So the bait is not big enough.

241
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,800
How could he

242
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,440
lose Highland 501

243
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,360
at the beginning of the exercise?

244
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,840
In this case,

245
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,040
Regiment 720 can aim directly

246
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,200
at their company command at the East Mountain.

If he's that stupid,

248
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,760
that's my fault.

Before the exercise,

251
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,280
I did some field survey.

252
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,720
If we want to strike Highland 502,

253
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,680

once the artillery is left
behind the Greenstone Gorge,

260
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,560
the risk will be multiplied by several times.

If we continue our assault forward,

262
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,000
the battlefront will be stretched.

how can you puff up the enemy

I agree, sir.

Either an army or a person,

282
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,080
we should know who we are,

283
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,360

to the battle accurately.

in the division combined.

382
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,600
The key point is that

383
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,960
everyone of Regiment 720

384
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,320
is longing to win.

385
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,880
I’ve heard

386
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,360
that high morale will increase

387
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,080
their battle power by 50% at least.

388
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,640
It's nice to have high morale.

389
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,160
But if the operational principle is wrong,

390
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,560
the high morale may become

391
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,720
a recipe for failure.

392
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,240
Why?

393
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,760
Sir,

394
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,520
what do you mean?

395
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,600
Qin is not that stupid

396
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,800
by welcoming the enemy.

397
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,700
[Blue Ridge Area Red vs Blue Posture Map]

398
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,720
If Song Jianshe prepares a deep strike,

399
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,520
the troops will be stretched longer.

400
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,320
Too many battle points and longer battlefront

401
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,200
will become the weak point for Regiment 720.

402
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,320
Qin Hanyong

403
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,520
has given up all the positions,

404
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,760
defends by attack

405
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,840
and gathers his main force

406
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:31,760
to

407
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,840
concentrate fire

408
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,960
on

409
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,320
Song Jianshe's stretched troops.

410
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,720
As they have the same

411
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,120
amount of soldiers,

412
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,120
then the decider will be

413
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,200
the quality of their daily training.

414
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,120
So there will be a tough fight.

415
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,160
Report!

416
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,440
The main force of Regiment 720 is

417
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,120
attacking forward towards Highland 502.

418
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,680
Regiment 700 has given up all the positions

419
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,120
and started to encircle and defeat

420
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,320
the main force of Regiment 720 step by step.

421
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,760
The forward troops of the Regiment 720

422
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,680
are already trapped.

423
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,800
Now we'll see

424
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,680
the resilience of Regiment 720.

425
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,040
They've had so many models
and so much experience.

426
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,800
Whether it works or not,

427
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,960
this exercise

428
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,400
is the test.

429
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,560
Messenger?

430
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,760
Yes!

431
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,880
The First Battalion?

432
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,600
What's happening up there?

433
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,240
Sir,

434
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,720
we are surrounded.

435
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,080
They've got 7 positions to defend.

436
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,400
How can they encircle you?

437
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:43,960
As we observed,

438
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,000
they gathered all their force in the forests

439
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,640
alongside both sides of Highland 502

440
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,160
and ambushed us.

441
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,440
Commander of the Second Battalion,

442
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,960
how's your situation?

443
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,240
We are blocked at the Greenstone Gorge.

444
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,400
Speed up!

445
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,280
Listen,

446
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,880
the Second Battalion is right behind you.

447
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,920
You must hold on

448
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,880
for support.

449
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,560
Their fire is extremely strong,

450
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,840
we are not able to hold on.

451
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,520
Sir,

452
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,880
Sir!

453
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,880
Hold on. Hold on.

454
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,120
Don't panic.

455
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,560
Yes!

456
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,160
What's the matter?

457
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,360
The troops are moving too slowly.

458
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,280
The Second Battalion hasn't passed
the Greenstone Gorge yet.

459
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,760
Where is Gao Liang's Ninth Company?

460
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,440
Report!

461
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,640
I don't know.

462
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,760
And where did Lu Pingfan

463
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,600
take my artillery position to?

464
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,000
Sir,

465
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,240
no worries,

466
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:28,920
no worries,

467
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:29,840
hold on.

468
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,080
Sir,

469
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,200
reported by scout from the upfront,

470
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,680
8 cannons of the enemy were found

471
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,840
on No. 5 Highway.

472
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,680
The amount doesn't match.

473
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,560
The division assigned an artillery battalion

474
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,840
to Regiment 720.

475
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,600
There should be at least 15 cannons.

476
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,560
Shall we wait longer

477
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,280
and keep scouting?

478
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,680
There's not enough time.

479
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,760
Control the cannons

480
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,800
and we can question them afterwards.

481
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,080
Move!

482
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,720
Have we got in contact
with the artillery battalion?

483
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,920
Sir,

484
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,400
they suddenly lost contact

485
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,480
on No. 5 Highway.

486
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,560
The situation is unclear.

487
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,920
Report!

488
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:17,720
Speak!

489
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,880
The First Company was surrounded and annihilated
by Regiment 700.

490
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,880
And the Exercise Conducting Department determined

491
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,200
that they shall exit the exercise.

492
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,680
Sir,

493
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,800
maybe we shall retreat.

494
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,440
If we keep holding on,

495
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,360
we may lose the Second Battalion as well.

496
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,400
Hold on,

497
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,440
what about Gao Liang?

498
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,600
After the Ninth Company took Highland 501

499
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,960
and the order of assault forward,

500
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,360
Chief of Staff Lu sent them to

501
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,120
cover the movement of the artillery battalion.

502
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,920
Lu Pingfan

503
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,560
really has got me into a fix.

504
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,760
Order!

505
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,480
Yes!

506
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,880
The front troops all

507
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,520
retreat to Highland 501.

508
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,480
Since we couldn't take Regiment 700,

509
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,640
we can't let them

510
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,240
beat us all.

511
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,320
Yes!

512
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,680
Commander of the Second Company?

513
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,760
You are from the artillery battalion
of Regiment 720.

514
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,720
Where are your other cannons?

515
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:18,520
Forget about that.

516
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,720
You won’t get it.

517
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,480
Bro,

518
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
stay alert.

519
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,280
When the enemy is unknown,

520
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,000
you moved your artillery positions at will

521
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,200
without a plan of what to do when attacked.

522
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,600
And you just lost like that.

523
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,640
Gu,

524
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,160
today you are my enemy.

525
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,160
Don't try to be matey with me.

526
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,600
Since the commander sent the order

527
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,600
of attack,

528
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,200
all that we need is to follow without hesitation.

529
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,560
As for the plan,

530
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,600
it's none of your business.

531
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,680
So, there is one.

532
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,480
I said nothing.

533
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,040
You’ve already

534
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,400
told me everything.

535
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,800
Report to the command,

536
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,440
the eight cannons of the enemy

537
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,960
were taken by us.

538
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,400
Request all these staff

539
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,560
to exit the exercise.

540
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,560
Leader of the First Platoon.

541
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,080
Yes!

542
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,360
Arrange a squad to

543
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,080
look out for the cannons we captured.

544
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:02,760
Yes!

545
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,000
Hurry up!

546
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,200
Get out! Get out!

547
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,960
What's wrong, sir?

548
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,520
My waist hurts.

549
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,720
Ah…

550
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,960
This time we may be captured.

551
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,680
Nonsense!

552
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,360
After the incident of the Zhangmu Train Station,

553
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,400
I swore I’d never be captured again

554
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,800
all my life.

555
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,200
Hurry up!

556
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,640
Run faster!

557
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:22,920
Run!

558
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,840
Stop!

559
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,440
Drop your weapons,

560
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,720
and stop!

561
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,200
Regiment 700, stop your pursuit and attack.

562
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,480
Why?

563
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,200
How could the Guidance Department
be so biased?

564
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,320
You already entered the coverage of

565
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,480
their artillery.

566
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,480
What kind of cannon can shoot this far?

567
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,680
The 122 Cannon.

568
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,080
I don't believe this.

569
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,800
Their 122 Cannon is still

570
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,240
blocked on No. 6 Highway.

571
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,200
They've already laid
their artillery positions upfront

572
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,440
and launched a simulated artillery fire

573
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,840
on your route forward.

574
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,160
Now you are separated from

575
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,240
Regiment 720 by cannon fire.

576
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,400
They are right in front.

577
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,480
How could this happen?

578
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,040
Lu Pingfan,

579
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,880
well done!

580
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,160
Fifteen minutes ago,

581
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,720
the Second Battalion of the Divisional Artillery Regiment
assigned to Regiment 720

582
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,800
blocked the pursuit route of Regiment 700

583
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,520
with intensive simulated artillery fire

584
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,360
on the newly constructed artillery positions

585
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,400
in the area of Sandouping,

586
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,280
covering Regiment 720 to retreat from the battlefield.

587
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,360
Now

588
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,800
Regiment 720 has begun to

589
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,240
collect and organize the retreated troops,

590
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,280
adjust their deployment

591
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,000
and prepare for counterattack.

592
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,360
What did you say?

593
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,920
The Second Battalion of
Artillery Regiment has arrived in Sandouping?

594
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,680
Yes.

595
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,560
Gosh!

596
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,560
It's a bit surprising.

597
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,440
Yeya Lake is between

598
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,380
[Regiment 720 Artillery Positions Data-Flow Diagram Regiment 700]

599
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,760
Sandouping and No. 7 Highway.

600
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,040
Cannons are so heavy.

601
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,920
Can they swim across the lake?

602
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,440
In the northeast corner of Yeya Lake,

603
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,280
there is a part

604
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,000
where the surface is narrow.

605
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,720
The water level is very low in this season.

606
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:48,700
[Regiment 720 Artillery Positions Data-Flow Diagram Regiment 700]

607
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,040
The bottom of the lake is flat and solid.

608
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,720
They're able to fill the lake

609
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,000
with a few trucks of soil.

610
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,440
Song Jianshe was supposed

611
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,480
to lose.

612
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,400
But with the cover of the artillery,

613
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,760
the situation may change.

614
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,560
Who did this?

615
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,960
He's a genius.

616
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,200
Lu!

617
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:12,720
Colonel.

618
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,600
Colonel.

619
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,040
It has been proved that

620
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,280
your tactic

621
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,880
did work.

622
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,200
We have

623
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,280
joined forces triumphantly.

624
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,120
Welcome back, Colonel.

625
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,520
Thank you for that.

626
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,680
You brought the cannon here?

627
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,200
This is the best place.

628
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,600
You crossed the Xiaotuo River?

629
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,120
Yep.

630
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,360
How did you cross it?

631
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,120
How did I cross it?

632
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,040
Drove through it, of course.

633
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,360
Lu.

634
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,440
This batch of equipment

635
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,440
was just distributed.

636
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,040
It's a brand-new batch.

637
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,000
I didn't even remove the oiled paper.

638
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,160
But you just crossed the river

639
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,600
with the equipment.

640
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,280
Colonel.

641
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,920
The equipment was distributed

642
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,680
to us to use.

643
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,080
Shall we put it aside

644
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:11,880
and exhibit it?

645
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,680
If you're a woman,

646
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,520
I believe you'll be a big spender.

647
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,200
Oh, please.

648
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:19,840
Colonel.

649
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:20,920
We can only test the performance

650
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,320
and combat effectiveness

651
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,920
of the equipment

652
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,440
in real battles.

653
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,480
But you have to cherish it.

654
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,840
The army is not rich.

655
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,960
Save something for the days

656
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,720
after the exercise.

657
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,640
It's an actual combat exercise.

658
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,200
Yes.

659
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,400
An actual combat exercise.

660
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,760
We have to treat it as an actual combat.

661
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,560
But

662
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,280
there's a huge difference

663
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,640
between the exercise and the actual combat.

664
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,960
If it had been

665
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:48,680
an actual combat,

666
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,800
why would those soldiers

667
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,600
chase me just now?

668
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,080
They would have shot me

669
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,480
and I would have been dead.

670
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,640
There should have been a gravestone

671
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,080
in front of you.

672
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,440
Why did you laugh?

673
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,120
You won the bet this time.

674
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,240
He really didn't say thank you.

675
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,600
I wanted to say it

676
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,880
but you stopped me.

677
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,960
Colonel Song.

678
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,400
If you don't listen to me,

679
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,480
you'll be in trouble again.

680
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,760
Did you hear me?

681
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,160
Gao Liang,

682
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,200
did you hear him?

683
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,640
How could you talk to your supervisor
in this way?

684
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,680
I think now you know

685
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,760
why Qin Hanyong

686
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,480
became an acting colonel

687
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,320
but you're still my chief of staff.

688
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,840

if the infantry doesn't have artillery,

691
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,960
they'll have to suffer.

692
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,800
A quick battle

693
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,080
is our key to winning.

to penetrate through

destroy their Command

and stop them from using the artillery.

Meanwhile,

00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,080
I'll launch an attack, too.

706

this artillery position

The weather is bad today.

724
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,200
It's very easy for them to

725

dispatch two squads to this area.

726
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,480

730
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,400
there is

731
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,680
nothing special

732
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,800
about your plan.

733
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,600
Even if you're going
to keep glaring at me today,

734
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,360
I'll still say it.

735
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,440
I'm sure

736
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,880
Lu Pingfan will expect

737

you to send people to deal with it.

738
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,600
I believe he'll have a countermeasure

739
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,480
and strengthen the protection
of the artillery.

740
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,800
If, at this moment,

741
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,480
we still only order a company

742
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,400
to launch an attack,

743
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,520
they'll be captured.

744
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,120
Come on.

745
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,120
Let's listen to

747
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,200
Come on.

748
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,920
Let's follow your plan.

749
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,920
Send a company

750
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,760
to penetrate.

751
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,080
But...

752
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,360
Let me lead a squad of twenty people

753
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,880
to carry out a raid.

754
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,600
What a dirty trick!

755
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,000
What if you can't find them?

756
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,120
Then we’ll left him

757
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,840
with a company of cannon fodders.

758
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,400

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,760
The artillery is performing
simulated shooting.

763
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,240
According to the exercise rules,

764
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,840
they can only learn the general direction

765
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,640
of our artillery
from the Guidance Department.

766
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,640
They cannot rely on this

767
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,520
to ascertain

768
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,200
the specific location
of our artillery position.

769
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,160
They can't even ascertain the location.

770
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,520
How can they destroy the artillery position?

771
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,240
It's all about math.

772
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,000
What will you get if you

and Gu Yiye's raid ability together?

776
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,160
You'll lose if you think you're lucky.

Encrypt it.

Yes.

Commander Gu?

What are you doing here?

786
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,920
Can I ask you

787
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,000
a question?

788
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,000
The war is going to break out.

789
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,200
We can't violate the rules.

790
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,400
Why are your clothes covered in dirt?

791
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,680
Learning from an old comrade

792
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,520
is not a violation of rules, right?

793
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,080
Listen.

794
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,680
I'll only answer technical questions.

795
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,040
I'll never provide you

796
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,360
with any war information.

797
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,160
Got it.

798
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,840
As a front-line commanding officer,

799
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,560
I'll give you battle reports

to help you instantly store data

801
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,760

00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,840
That's the reason why your group

803
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
came here, right?

804
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,800
At dawn,

805
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,600
when our army chased Regiment 720,

[Blue Ridge Exercise Ground]

807
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,360
we were stopped by gunfire.

808
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,520
Here's the location.

809
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,000
Take this as the origin point.

810
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,880
There are three open grounds

811
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,840
in the range of Position 122.

812
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,920
The enemy gunfire

813
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,440
came from the northwest.

814
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,040
Position 122

815
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,600
needs open terrain.

816
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,000
Therefore, we can tell

817
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,400
that the enemy

My speculation is right, isn't it?

823
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,400
No, but...

824
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,640
The data is confidential.

825
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,680
It's the exercise rule.

00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,640
If Qin Hanyong attacks my base camp,

827
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,000
I'll let him pay for it.

Yes.

to reach Niudu Outpost

within an hour.

834
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,040
If you let anyone of Regiment 700 go,

835
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,000
I'll punish you.

Yes.

837
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,120
Make sure

838

both the equipment and soldiers are safe.

00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,760
Make sure of their safety.

Yes.

00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,520
Yes.

843
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,520
Keep going.

844
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,600
Yes. Keep going!

845
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,600
What happened?

There’s a venomous snake.

Wang Xiaolei was so scared

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,520
that he threw away a grenade.

850
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,320
However, the distance was short.

851
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,280
The grenade exploded and someone got hurt.

852
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,880
How could you throw away
a grenade so carelessly?

853
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,360
Even the fake grenade can hurt people.

854
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,080
Don't you know that?

855
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,160
Send him to the Combat Medic now!

Come on.

Take a rest.

Sir!

861
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,320
Say it.

862
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,640
We found that a company
of Regiment 700

863
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,760
is penetrating into
our Position 3 and Position 4.

864
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,440
I didn't expect that our prey

865
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,720
arrived at our door so fast.

867
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:43,560
Yes.

868
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,240
We're going to have a big meal.

869
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,760
How's your appetite today?

870
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,920
I promise I'll finish all of the food.

871
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,960
If anyone flees,

872
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:49,720
dismiss me from my post.

873
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,520
Good.

874
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,480
Let's get started!

Yes!

The First Contingent,
outflank enemies on the left.

877
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,120
Gunners, cover them.

00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,880
The Second Contingent,

879
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,160
outflank enemies on the right.

880
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,120
Mortars,

881
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:35,800
fire!

882
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,400
Fire!

883
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,000
Battalion Commander,
the Colonel wants to talk to you.

884
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,440
Hello.

885
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,000
This is Xia Lin.

886
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,720
How's everything with you?

887
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,520
They entered our ambush.

888
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,480
We're attacking them from two flanks.

889
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,360
Now they’ve been cornered.

890
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,240
Good.

891
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,360
Do you need support?

892
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,160
No!

893
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,200
The battle is going to end soon!

894
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,200
Wonderful!

895
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,880
Listen.

896
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:08,920
This time

897
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,800
if you annihilate one of his companies,

898
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,920
it's like

899
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,720
extracting one of Qin Hanyong's teeth.

900
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,200
I'll give you the highest Merit.

901
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,760
I promise I'll complete the task!

902
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,800
Gao Liang! Go!

903
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,640
Go!

904
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,560
Hurry up!

905
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,240
Hurry up!

906
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,080
Yes.

907
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,240
Colonel.

908
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,360
According to the Guidance Department,

909
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,800
the Second Company
of our First Battalion were annihilated.

910
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,520
What did I say?

911
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,960
Gu Yiye played such a dirty trick.

912
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,120
The whole company

913
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,080
became cannon fodders because of him.

914
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,720
We were ordered

915
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,760
to try our best to attack the position.

916
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,160
There's nothing else.

917
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,320
Take him away.

918
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,240
How's it going?

919
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,680
They were ordered

920
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,200
to go full force.

921
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,760
They have no idea why they need to attack us.

922
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,520
What's your opinion?

923
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,360
I think

924
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,560
it's a feint attack.

925
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,240
They have other goals.

926
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,600
They were attracting our attention.

927
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,080
Gao Liang.

928
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,200
Think about it.

929
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,800
They wouldn't waste

930
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,240
a company.

931
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,120
The Ninth Company has already
won a victory.

932
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,360
Besides, we have artillery.

933
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,360
Obviously,

934
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,120
the result is certain.

935
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,480
Obviously, it's a trap.

936
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,640
Where's Gu Yiye now?

937
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,640
Half an hour ago, he told us

938
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,640
he found the location
of the enemy artillery position.

939
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,200
He was going to go deep in Regiment 720.

940
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,480
He's a little cruel

941
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,800
but he knows to focus on the essentials.

942
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,160
He's a good commander.

943
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,840
As long as he destroys the command system

944
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,560
of the artillery of Regiment 720
before the attack,

945
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,040
no matter how big the price is,

946
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,120
it’s worth it.

947
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,680
Gao Liang, listen.

948
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,200
Your primary task

949
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,000
is to make sure the Ninth Company
keeps the advantage

950
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,560
and wins

951
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,840
instead of

952
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,920
turning victories

953
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,280
into casualties.

954
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,240
Xia Lin.

955
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,080
You are being penny-wise.

956
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,360
If you do that,

957
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,800
the Ninth Company will be ruined.

958
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:16,720
Gao Liang.

959
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,960
If you do anything rash,

960
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,320
the Ninth Company will be ruined for real!

961
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,640
Obey my order.

962
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,960
What will happen if I don't obey it?

963
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,480
If you don't obey it,

964
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,840
I'll tell the Conducting Department

965
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,480
that you disobeyed my order

966
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,520
and ask them to

967
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,760
punish you.

968
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,680
He Dazhuang!

969
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,440
Yes!

970
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,440
Lead the Third Platoon. Follow me.

971
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,000
Yes!

972
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,280
All of them are here.

973
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,400
The eight cannons are all here.

974
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,720
You're amazing, Company Commander.

975
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,160
We just reached here

976
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,680
without even firing once.

977
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,400
Outflank them at the rear

978
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,720
with the First Contingent.

979
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,600
Make sure you destroy

980
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,960
their artillery's command system.

981
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,440
OK.

982
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,560
Guys, follow me.

983
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,050
Don't move!

984
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:11,960
Commander Gao.

985
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,240
You ran so fast.

986
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,160
Commander Gao.

987
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,040
I have a question for you.

988
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,200
Did you join Regiment 720?

989
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:20,960
No.

990
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,040
But Gao,

991
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:22,960
soon we'll

992
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,880
annihilate Regiment 720.

993
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,000
You're not that good.

994
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,400
According to the exercise rules,

995
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,880
you've already lost.

996
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,440
Really?

997
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,360
Put the guns down.

998
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,440
If it was the real battlefield,

999
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,520
now

1000
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,280
I should capture all of you.

1001
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,160
But today I'll be a traitor
to Regiment 720

1002
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,800
because we'll have to
fight on the real battlefield one day.

1003
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,440
Why?

1004
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,920
Regiment 720 needs a crushing defeat.

1005
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,320
Only in this way, can it be a real exercise.

1006
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,920
If it was a real exercise,

1007
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,920
you should kill me now.

1008
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,520
What I pursue is not the authenticity

1009
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,120
or the exercise.

1010
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,920
What I pursue

1011
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,320
is the thing behind the real exercise.

1012
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,560
So now my best solution

1013
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,200
is to let you go.

1014
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,080
Got it.

1015
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,720
I use my blood

1016
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,680
to show my deep love for my country.

1017
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,280
Gao is going to

1018
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,680
be a tragic hero this time.

1019
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,280
You don't get it!

1020
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,600
To be a traitor.

1021
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,840
Do you know how hard it is for me?

1022
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,360
Gao.

1023
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,120
Let's have a talk.

1024
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,440
There are more ways to

1025
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,680
make a change.

1026
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,840
Even if I can't change it,

1027
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,120
I promise you

1028
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,160
the reality will never change me.

1029
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,200
Their fraud really made me

1030
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,240
angry.

1031
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,440
Gao Liang.

1032
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,480
Enough. Time is running out.

1033
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,920
Blue Army, attention, please!

1034
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,520
Today I'll let you go.

1035
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,200
Before the deadline,

1036
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,560
make sure
you occupy Red Army's artillery position.

1037
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,760
Help Regiment 720. It's your former regiment.

1038
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:16,760
You can go.

1039
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:19,920
Everyone,

1040
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,000
follow me!

1041
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:43,100
[Regiment 720 Artillery Positions Data-Flow Diagram Regiment 700]

1042
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:42,960
Sir!

1043
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,960
The command system of the artillery position
of Regiment 720

1044
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,600
was destroyed
by Qin Hanyong's small contingent.

1045
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,000
The Conducting Department considers it
a valid attack.

1046
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,190
Then why the artillery of Regiment 720

1047
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,800
is still firing?

1048
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,840
We received a notification.

1049
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,670
Regiment 720

1050
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,200
created the second command system
a long time ago.

1051
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,520
Qin Hanyong's small contingent

1052
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,920
only destroyed one of the stand-ins.

1053
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,920
Go and check.

1054
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,280
Who came up with this idea?

1055
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,320
Good job.

1056
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,080
Yes!

1057
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,760
It's time to launch an attack.

1058
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,120
What's wrong with Gu Yiye?

1059
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,720
He's nothing

1060
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,800
but eye candy.

1061
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,040
It's really hard

1062
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,320
to deal with Lu Pingfan.

1063
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,960
He's smarter than me.

1064
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,560
We need not only the interception

1065
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,840
but also a countermeasure.

1066
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,760
Countermeasure?

1067
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,520
Yes, countermeasure.

1068
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:28,880
Our infantry

1069
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,360
cannot beat theirs.

1070
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,680
Soldiers and canons’ synergy

1071
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,640
is our advantage.

1072
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,280
Gao Liang’s strategy is superior.

1073
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,320
When they're on their way
to the place of departure,

1074
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,400
he thought

1075
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,160
there might be many accidents
in the real battle

1076
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,560
so he brought a company's

1077
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,680
100-mm mortars.

1078
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:44,960
Colonel.

1079
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,640
Our attacker army

1080
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,920
was attacked by the gunfire of Regiment 720.

1081
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,480
Order the army

1082
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,560
to hang in there,

1083
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,560
separate

1084
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,800
and head for the front-line position.

1085
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,800
Fight against Song Jianshe.

1086
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,880
If we have to die, die with him!

1087
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,440
Yes!

1088
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,080
Company Commander!

1089
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,880
The ammunition dump is at the front
of this place.

1090
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,000
They're prepared.

1091
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,960
We can't blow it up in a short time.

1092
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,320
Don't worry.

1093
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,440
They don't have a lot of people.

1094
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,320
The gunfire on the left flank is powerful.

1095
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,360
Lead two soldiers,

1096
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,560
carry out a raid from the left flank

1097
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,680
to attract the gunfire of our enemies.

1098
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,120
Rest of you

1099
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,240
carry out a raid
from the right flank with me.

1100
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,560
Blow their ammunition dump

1101
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,640
at any price.

1102
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,600
Destroy their

1103
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,760
cannons!

1104
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,280
Sergeant of the First Squad, follow me!

1105
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,240
Let's go!

1106
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,200
Company Commander!

1107
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,200
Enemies on the left

1108
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,760
outflanked us from the rear.

1109
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,640
Now there are enemies
at both the front and the rear.

1110
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,480
What should we do?

1111
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,000
Time is running out.

1112
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,040
If we don't hurry up,

1113
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,440
Colonel and his people will be annihilated.

1114
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,120
Company Commander.

1115
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,240
Hurry up.

1116
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,040
Give orders.

1117
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,040
I did that.

1118
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,320
Am I wrong?

1119
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:36,680
No, you're not.

1120
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,480
We don't care about the defeat.

1121
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,280
What we care is how we can win
in the future.

1122
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,280
Stop hesitating.

1123
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,200
Cease fire!

1124
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,440
Let them go.

1125
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,960
Stop them!

1126
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,400
Stop them!

1127
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,040
Don't let them run away!

1128
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:39,920
Stop them.

1129
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,440
What are you doing?

1130
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,000
What are you doing?

1131
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,960
Your artillery's ammunition dump

1132
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,040
has already been blown up by us.

1133
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,320
Just a few

1134
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,480
of you?

1135
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:08,880
No.

1136
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,560
Gao Liang helped us.

1137
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,960
He betrayed Regiment 720.

1138
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,000
If he didn't put the weapon down,

1139
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,760
we would never win.

1140
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:20,800
He's brave.

1141
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,320
Don't you feel ashamed?

1142
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,840
If he didn't do that,

1143
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,520
Regiment 720

1144
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,440
would keep dreaming

1145
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,600
in their fantasy world.

1146
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,520
Wake them up in a harsh way.

1147
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,400
It's worth it.

1148
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,440
It's a fraud.

1149
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,720
My victory is disgraceful.

1150
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,520
Victory?

1151
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,680
You just won the trophy.

1152
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,400
We got

1153
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,240
more than you.

1154
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,960
Left, right, left.

1155
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,040
Leave some water for me.

1156
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:57,220
Three, four.

1157
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,840
I let you win the exercise.
Why can't I drink your water?

1158
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,400
Enough.

1159
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,280
Don't take it for granted.

1160
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,240
I have a question for you.

1161
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,240
Have you ever thought of the consequence?

1162
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,120
Forget about the distant future.

1163
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,520
I had to save the Ninth Company, right?

1164
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,440
I'm a company commander.

1165
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,520
I have to be responsible
for the whole company.

1166
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,040
They all said as soldiers,
we have to make sacrifices.

1167
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,400
But I can't let my soldiers

1168
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,080
sacrifice

1169
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,080
for some useless people.

1170
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,960
That's not their goal.

1171
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,440
As members of a Training Company,

1172
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,160
they’ve never practiced
throwing real grenades.

1173
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,680
I just returned from the hospital.

1174
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,640
Two of my soldiers got injured.

1175
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,120
One has an injured leg

1176
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,760
and the other has an injured arm.

1177
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,200
That’s the result of cheating

1178
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,720
so we had to lose once.

1179
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,200
Destroy the team and rebuild it.

1180
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:51,800
Am I right?

1181
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,160
No making without breaking.

1182
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,800
In the future,
I'll be strict with the training.

1183
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,520
Do you know what's the biggest problem

1184
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,040
of the Ninth Company now?

1185
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,640
They don't know who they are now.

1186
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,040
They became overconfident
after being praised by others.

1187
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,000
Thinking that my old company is like this now,

1188
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,600
I feel bad.

1189
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,640
I'm sorry for

1190
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,240
the seniors who have passed away.

1191
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,640
It's not too late

1192
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,280
to change.

1193
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,600
I can help you

1194
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,200
make Night Tiger Company

1195
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,080
better.

1196
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,720
Just try to

1197
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,360
catch up with us.

1198
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,200
What are you gonna do?

1199
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,240
You're the light
that will never be swallowed by the darkness.

1200
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,360
What can I do for you?

1201
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,640
Cows and sheep flock

1202
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,440
but beasts

1203
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,520
live alone.

1204
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,280
Are you going to wait?

1205
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,440
I'll observe

1206
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,360
and think.

1207
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,160
I'll make changes

1208
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,320
in my way.

1209
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:49,920
What you did

1210
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:50,920
is heroically tragic

1211
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:54,810
but it would affect a lot of things.

1212
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,080
Are you scared?

1213
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:00,800
No, I'm not.

1214
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,520
But I know

1215
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,440
what reverence and respect are.

1216
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,000
If I really want to make changes,

1217
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,480
I'll carry out a plan step by step.

1218
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,240
I won't make a drastic change

1219
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,480
like you.

1220
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:18,060
[Gulf War Materials]

1221
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,250
The onslaught on Saddam's line of defense

1222
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,480
prevented Iraq from knowing

1223
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,400
the real intention
of the Multinational Force.

1224
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,680
When Saddam finally realized,

1225
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,610
it's too late.

1226
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:27,420
Kuwait was liberated.

1227
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,220
Iraq had surrendered.

1228
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,100
The Gulf War has ended.

1229
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,080
Did you see it?

1230
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,240
What were they doing?

1231
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,960
What were you doing?

1232
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,320
Before today's meeting,

1233
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,240
someone talked to me.

1234
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,040
He said someone cheated

1235
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,800
in the exercise.
