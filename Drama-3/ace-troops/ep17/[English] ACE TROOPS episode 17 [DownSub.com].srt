Platoon Leader!

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:38,900
Platoon Leader!

3
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,340
Platoon Leader, I’m sorry.

4
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,259
Yesterday, we…

5
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,100
That was my own business,

6
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,660
it has nothing to do with you guys.

7
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:57,900
What are you doing?

8
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,260
Platoon Leader, it was all my idea.

9
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,700
I’m sorry.

10
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,020
I told you!

11
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,900
This has nothing to do with you guys!

12
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,860

13
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,220
Sister-in-law!

14
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,980
Sister-in-law!

15
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,700
Sister-in-law!

16
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,340
Fei boy!

17
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,660
Your regiment’s mission is inserting into the enemy’s back.

18
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,380
To put it in a simpler way,

19
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,180
you have to go into the enemy’s troops.

20
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,980
If you made it, it’s called center flowering.

21
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,780
The enemy will break apart in a second.

22
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,380
Sounds like a good tactic.

23
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,460
Five years ago,

24
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,140
my regiment also got the order to insert ourselves into the enemies.

25
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,540
But I got trapped by the enemy,

26
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,180
and fought for 3 days and 4 nights. It was a hard fight.

27
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,860
A whole mountain,

28
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,820
except the trees blown down, are corpses.

29
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,740
After the mission was accomplished and all soldiers counted.

30
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,940
The whole regiment lost 187 soldiers,

31
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,940
692 got hurt.

32
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,220
It was such a fierce battle.

33
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,340
Sir, I’m not afraid.

34
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,500
I joined the army to protect my country.

35
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,260
I’ve thought about it, and am prepared.

36
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,700
I know, I know.

37
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:05,980
Sir…

38
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,860
Don’t talk,

39
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,660
let me think.

40
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,900
Has the colonel come back yet?

41
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:19,480
[Raise vigilance, defend the motherland, be strict with requirements, and make solid preparations.]

42
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,420
No.

43
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,540
Deputy Colonel is already gone.

44
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,779
You stay here and wait for the Colonel.

45
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:17,820
We’ll go ahead.

46
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,060
Deputy Staff Officer!

47
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,380
The troop has moved on to the frontline.

48
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,580
I’ll go to the train station.

49
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,500
You tell Political Commissar.

50
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,140
Yes, sir!

51
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,990
Let’s go.

52
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,500
Your personal equipment is already in the back trunk.

53
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,300
I’ve got your recommendation letter

54
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,140
and supply relationship all ready.

55
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,180
When you arrive at the train station,

56
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,590
Secretary Wang will hand them to you.

57
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,190
When you get to the troop,

58
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,870
remember to write me often.

59
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,020
Sir,

60
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,260
you thought about letting me back to the army a long time ago?

61
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,820
I was a soldier before.

62
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,580
How can I not understand your feeling?

63
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,780
We don’t need to say those big words.

64
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,700
Alright.

65
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,140
You know what,

66
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,500
I can order you to stay.

67
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,980
I know

68
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,980
keeping you here

69
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,340
might be keeping your life.

70
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,740
But I know you’ve thought it through.

71
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,980
You’ve thought through,

72
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,540
I won’t ask you to stay.

73
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:28,860
Sir,

74
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,380
then why didn’t you

75
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,180
let me go back with the Colonel?

76
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,140
My Public Servant is like my half son.

77
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,420
I need to give you a ride myself.

78
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,940
A man

79
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,500
should not do so much meaningless things.

80
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,340
It’s not meaningless, sir.

81
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,980
I’m not doing this because you said I’m your half son.

82
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,170
Attention!

85
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,900
Infantry Regiment 700 is all set,

86
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,380
please give the orders! Deputy Colonel Wang Anren.

87
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,060
Set out in five minutes.

88
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:31,740
Yes, sir!

89
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:41,980
Sir,

90
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,060
do you have anything else

91
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,640
to say to me?

92
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,620
Sir,

93
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,620
when I was with you,

94
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,240
I caused you quite a lot trouble,

95
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:17,820
please don’t be mad.

96
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,600
When I’m gone,

97
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
eat meals normally, don’t stay up all the time.

98
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,200
I’ll keep it in mind.

99
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,680
When the war is over,

100
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,040
will you come back?

101
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,160
If you need,

102
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,160
I definitely will!

103
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,840
You boy!

104
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,760
Don’t have me find you in the martyrs cemetery!

105

the Communication Company is just around here.

113
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,320
Do you want to make the car stop for a while?

114
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,520
I can call Jiang Nanzheng in.

115
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,280

116

00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,880
who’ll see them?

118
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,240
I already took

119
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,360
their parents’ place just now,

120
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,360
and Gao Liang took all the soldiers’ place.

121
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,289
We’ve already said goodbye.

122
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,000
The farewell from me, the division commander,

123
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:35,880

Did you get dismissed by the Division Commander?

What nonsense are you talking about?

158
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,750
Division Commander is giving me a chance to serve the motherland.

159
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,760
Okay, fine.

00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,940
Didn’t she go to the art troupe?

192
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,630
She could have stayed off the front lines.

193
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,430
Division Commander asked me to get her back.

194
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,240
They belonged to the Communication Company in the rear command post.

195
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,200
It’s not that dangerous.

196
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,560
Really naive.

197
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,480
Everyone up and inside.

198
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,370
Watch out for slippery feet.

199
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,450
Hurry up in the back!

200
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,460
Comrade female soldiers,

201
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,280
good job.

202
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,480
Comrade female soldiers, good job.

203
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,440
All attention!

204
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,000
Salute to our female comrades!

205
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,920
Salute!

206
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,600
Communication Company,

207
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,360
all attention.

208
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,680
Salute!

209
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:08,840
Hands down!

210
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,960
Stop fooling around and get in the train.

211
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,840
All attention!

212
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,960
Turn right!

213
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,200
At the double-quick march!

214
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,880
Stop. Which unit are you from?

215
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,160
I’m from the Regiment 720.

216
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,160
That’s our company.

217
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,080
Comrade,

218
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,240
I came back on purpose.

219
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,320
By the way, I’ll show you my ID.

220
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,250
Hurry up!

221
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,210
People in the back, keep up.

222
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,480
Company Commander!

223
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,320
Zhao Hongliu.

224
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,640
Okay, you can go now.

225
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:32,200
Thank you.

226
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:32,880
Company Commander.

227
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,560
Company Commander.

228
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,560
Zhao Hongliu.

229
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,880
I thought you went to visit your family members.

230
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,400
Company Commander.

231
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,040
Why are you back?

232
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,080
Leave your sister alone?

233
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,800
Never mind.

234
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,640
As soon as the bus arrived at Huining to stop at the station,

235
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,920
I saw the troops of the Division 231

236
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,640
boarding the train.

237
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,520
I knew there was going to be a war.

238
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,600
So, I ran back.

239
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,480
Okay, fine, get in the train.

240
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,160
Get on the train quickly.

241
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:48,680
Boarding quickly.

242
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,560
Hongliu, you’re back.

243
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,480
Come here, come here.

244
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,600
You really went to find your sister,

245
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,480
not as a deserter.

246
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,120
Screw you.

247
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,440
You look down on people too much.

248
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,120
Okay.

249
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,000
I admit that

250
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,840
I am not as good as you in training.

251
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,240
But I’m also the People’s son,

252
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,680
with the blood of soldiers flowing in my body.

253
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,520
Even if I do the nastiest things,

254
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,800
I can’t be a deserter.

255
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,400
Good boy.

256
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,400
Now the men are all here.

257
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,360
As long as our brothers in the Ninth Squad go to the battlefield,

258
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,680
we will not let the enemy succeed.

259
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,360
Yeah, beat up the enemy.

260
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,240
Beat up the enemy.

261
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,320
Comrade, no entry here.

262
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,600
Look at that, sister-in-law.

263
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,240
I need to find someone. I’ll give it to him.

264
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:23,890
Xiu!

265
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,000
No.

266
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,480
Xiu!

267
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,860
Sister-in-law!

268
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,080
Xiu!

269
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,440
Fei boy, I bought this for you.

270
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,840
Please let me in.

271
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,440
I’ll just give this…

272
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:32,880
No way.

273
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,680
Gu Yiye.

274
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,080
Stop.

275
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
What are you doing?

276
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,040
That comrade over there

277
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,400
is our platoon leader’s fiancée.

278
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,440
- Neither can fiancée. There are rules from above.
- Fei boy, I bought this.

279
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,800
No one is allowed to enter or leave the station.

280
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,080
Just let them see each other.

281
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,760
Not even for one time.

282
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,480
What time is it? Hurry up.

283
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,480
Hurry up, go back.

284
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,520
What are you doing?

285
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,840
What are you doing?

286
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,000
Stand still!

287
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,440
Salute!

288
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:54,920
Hands down.

289
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,000
What’s going on?

290
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,440
Deputy Chief of Staff, here is the thing.

291
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,960
The girl is Zhang Fei’s fiancée.

292
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,300
- She came to the Army yesterday.
- Please let me in.

293
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,400
- They didn’t see each other
- I’ll give this to him.

294
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,160
when he left this morning.

295
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,200
Let them see each other.

296
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,480
Are you kidding me?

297
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,120
The train is about to leave.

298
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,160
Just three minutes.

299
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,280
Let them meet once.

300
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,160
Not for a minute.

301
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,480
If he does,

302
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,440
what about the others?

303
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,920
Does everyone take a leave of absence?

304
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
It would be unreasonable of you to say so.

305
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,880
Qin Hanyong.

306
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,120
- I command you to bring soldiers to the train.
- Fei boy.

307
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,120
Deputy Chief of Staff,

308
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,720
I’m not trying to contradict you.

309
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,960
It is not easy for the girl to come all the way here.

310
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,600
Just a few steps away.

311
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,760
I said get in the train!

312
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,840
Get in the train.

313
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,880
Do you hear that?

314
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,680
Do you want to violate military disciplines?

315
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,680
Song Jianshe.

316
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,520
Qin.

317
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,760
I lead my soldiers into battle,

318
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,880
not on a spring trip.

319
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,960
Believe it or not, I will remove you from your position.

320
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
It’s too late to remove me before going to the battlefield.

321
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,120
Somebody!

322
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:42,880
What are you doing?

323
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,240
What are you doing?

324
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,080
Fei boy!

325
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:49,920
Xiu!

326
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,320
Xiu!

327
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,680
Fei boy.

328
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,680
Don’t fight.

329
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,080
Xiu.

330
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,520
Go home.

331
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,080
I’ll come back alive.

332
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,960
Fei boy.

333
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,760
I’ll be fine.

334
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,720
When I come back,

335
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,240
when I come back, we will live a good life.

336
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,240
Go home.

337
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,040
I told you to go back, you hear me?

338
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,840
Go back.

339
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,720
[Zhangmu Train Station]

340
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,440
[Zhangmu Hongshikou Lanxi]

341
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,800
[Zhangmu Train Station]

342
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,120
Report to the Chief,

343
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,400
Gu Yiye of the Ninth Company

344
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:49,000
[Zhangmu Train Station]

345
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,600
has been waiting for you outside the station.

346
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,400
Go.

347
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,280
Song Jianshe, you bastard!

348
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,160
He’s so relentless.

349
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,120
I counted the bill with him.

350
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,040
Where’s Gu Yiye?

351
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,640
Gu.

352
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,040
Gu Yiye.

353
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:14,880
Gu.

354
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:23,839
Where is he?

355
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,040
How did I lose Yiye?

356
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,920
Gu Yiye is over there.

357
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,200
And sister-in-law.

358
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,160
Gu Yiye.

359
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,440
Xiu.

360
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,600
Xiu, look to the right.

361
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,680
It’s over there.

362
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,320
There, sister-in-law.

363
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,360
Don’t rush.

364
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,760
Wait a minute, change clothes.

365
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,720
What clothes to change, Qin?

366
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,320
Wear my cadre uniform.

367
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,320
Put on my cadre uniform.

368
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,600
Quick, quick.

369
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,160
Sister-in-law.

370
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,440
Zhang Fei.

371
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,520
Sister-in-law.

372
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,520
Sister-in-law.

373
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,160
Sergeant, hurry up.

374
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:27,960
Is that all right?

375
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:28,680
Okay, okay.

376
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,800
Sergeant is in the back.

377
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,800
Sister-in-law.

378
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,400
Hurry up, hurry up.

379
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,360
Zhang Fei.

380
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,040
Can you hear me?

381
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,000
Xiu.

382
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,960
I have four pockets. Did you see them?

383
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,160
Four pockets!

384
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,560
Do you see them?

385
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,840
Zhang Fei.

386
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,120
Can you hear me?

387
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,400
I can hear you.

388
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,960
Do you see them?

389
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,120
Zhang Fei.

390
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,040
You can fight at ease

391
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,240
and don’t worry about home.

392
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,880
I’m not going anywhere

393
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,520
just going home.

394
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,800
I will take care of our mom.

395
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,440
Feed the pigs at home well.

396
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,600
Zhang Fei,

397
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,520
make contributions to our country.

398
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,920
Xiu.

399
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,680
Sister-in-law.

400
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
[August First]

401
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,080
I command

402
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,880
all officers and soldiers

403
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,800
to salute our loved ones who bid farewell to us!

404
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,520
Salute!

405
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,800
All salute!

406
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,640
[August First]

407
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,560
The First Company, all of you!

408
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,840
Salute!

409
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,880
Communication Company, all of you!

410
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,120
Salute!

411
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,360
[August First]

412
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,120
Do you know who sent them here?

413
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:52,920
I don’t know.

414
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,920
Song Jianshe.

415
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,360
Surprise, right?

416
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,880
I did not expect him

417
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,680
to do something like this.

418
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,680
I’ll apologize to him

419
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,320
for what he did.

420
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,040
Gu Yiye has gone aboard,

421
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,960
and has been waiting for us

422
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,920
in the next stop.

423
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,520
You just bring him back

424
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,240
upon arriving at the station.

425
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,920
Gu Yiye

426
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,840
did nicely.

427
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,640
That’s right.

428
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,560
But you can

429
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,760
cut the compliments.

430
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,760
It’s a sensitive matter.

431
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,080
I know.

432
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,880
Okay.

433
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,560
It’s about time.

434
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,120
Get ready for the pick-up.

435
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,400
Don’t goof up.

436
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,320
Don’t worry.

437
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,320
What’s that?

438
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,840
You scared me.

439
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,680
Why don’t you sleep?

440
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,520
I can’t.

441
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,800
Thinking of Xiu.

442
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,040
Gao Liang,

443
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,120
is my wife

444
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,280
gorgeous?

445
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,680
She is so gorgeous

446
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,400
that she amazes the whole regiment.

447
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,680
You should be proud.

448
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,720
Such an honour.

449
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,680
Alright, cut if off.

450
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,400
Stop pretending.

451
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,880
That’s my wife.

452
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,080
You can get your own wife

453
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,320
in the future.

454
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,960
Don’t interrupt me. What is in it?

455
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,600
Steamed stuffed buns.

456
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:38,800
Steamed stuffed buns.

457
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,720
Give me one. I’m hungry.

458
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,200
Stop it.

459
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,960
I saw you eating eight buns

460
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,640
for dinner tonight.

461
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,800
Eight big buns. You’re good!

462
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,440
You can’t have them, even if you’re hungry.

463
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,160
They’re for Yiye.

464
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:52,880
Is he coming back?

465
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,280
Our train will stop shortly

466
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,040
in the next station for water refilling.

467
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,040
Yiye will be waiting for us on the platform.

468
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,600
Stop it, stop it.

469
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,560
Go to sleep,

470
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,760
and save some of your energy.

471
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,480
Okay.

472
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,400
Go to sleep. What are you looking at? Go ahead and sleep.

473
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,760
I can’t.

474
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,600
You have to sleep even if you can’t.

475
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,800
Close your eyes.

476
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:12,960
Close your eyes.

477
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,240
Close your eyes. Shut it.

478
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,160
Close your eyes.

479
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,080
Thanks.

480
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,040
Report, Platoon Leader!

481
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,160
Gu Yiye’s reporting.

482
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,080
Do you know what my sister-in-law

483
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,360
said to me today when I left?

484
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,880
What did she say?

485
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,320
What did she say?

486
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,640
I asked her today when I left,

487
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:46,960
“sister-in-law,”

488
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,720
“did you see our Platoon Leader wearing the cadre uniform?”

489
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,120
“Isn’t he handsome?”

490
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,080
Guess what she said.

491
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,080
She saw that, right?

492
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:52,800
I was wearing

493
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,680
the uniform of Qin Hanyong, right?

494
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,520
With four pockets, right.

495
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,360
She said that

496
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,840
she was eager to talk to you back then

497
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,520
without concerning at all what you wore.

498
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,520
Besides,

499
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,720
all the soldiers in the carriage were wearing the same green uniforms.

500
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,520
She could not find you either.

501
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,200
Don’t worry, Platoon Leader.

502
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,840
Deputy Chief of Staff Song has made arrangements

503
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,440
and send sister-in-law back to the camp.

504
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,400
Okay.

505
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,720
Steamed stuffed buns.

506
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,320
I’ve been kept them in my bag.

507
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,640
They should still be warm.

508
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,640
Hurry up and eat it.

509
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,440
Jiang Nanzheng,

510
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,840
why are you here?

511
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,120
I’m here for you.

512
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,080
Why?

513
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,160
Have you asked for leave?

514
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,040
[Frontier]

515
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,480
Yeah.

516
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,040
Hurry back. You’re jumping on my back.

517
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,480
Okay, then I’m leaving.

518
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,000
I’m leaving

519
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,880
with the message from your dad.

520
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,040
You can’t say a word without pissing me off, can you?

521
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,240
You wouldn’t listen to me if I don’t piss you off.

522
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,270
- Speak. - Keep it down.

523
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,160
Go ahead.

524
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,160
What’s the matter?

525
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,800
I seldom went back home

526
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,520
all these years being in the army.

527
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,040
The year before last,

528
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,520
I took a vacation.

529
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,920
As soon as I went back home and laid down my luggage,

530
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,760
my mum rushed me to a blind date

531
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,520
with the matchmaker right away.

532
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,640
I understand her anxiety,

533
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,280
after all I’m turning 30 and still single.

534
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,440
On my way to the blind date,

535
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,520
I met Xiu.

536
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,640
I remembered that, at that time,

537
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,080
I was going up the mountain, and she was going down.

538
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,640
The minute I laid my eyes on her,

539
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,090
my heart started beating,

540
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,840
beating as rapidly as I could imagine.

541
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,480
I wondered

542
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,000
who this girl was.

543
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,240
So beautiful.

544
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,880
I just moved along and didn’t dare to keep staring at her.

545
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,520
Out of nowhere,

546
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,200
Xiu caught me up from behind

547
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,560
and stopped me.

548
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,280
She said,

549
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:51,840
“You...”

550
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,760
“is this uniform borrowed from someone?”

551
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,200
My uniform,

552
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,440
how was it possible for me borrowing a uniform?

553
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,040
It was from the army.

554
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,280
I am an official member of People's Liberation Army.

555
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,000
I could not stand it,

556
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,120
and wanted to show her

557
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,240
the name tag

558
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,280
on the collar.

559
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,680
And then Xiu

560
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,080
burst into laughter.

561
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,920
She said,

562
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,640
“Uniform”

563
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,040
“is nice.”

564
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,520
“I really admire soldiers from People's Liberation Army.”

565
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,240
I did not get it.

566
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,640
I was a soldier from People’s Liberation Army.

567
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,800
And she liked soldiers from People’s Liberation Army.

568
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,440
The matchmaker, seeing this,

569
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,680
came to me and whispered to me.

570
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,120
She said,

571
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,200
“Quit the fantasy.”

572
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,040
“This girl is a bee-keeper on the mountain,”

573
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,400
“and has a well-off family.”

574
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,440
“The matchmakers for this girl”

575
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,760
“were beyond count,”

576
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,000
“but she just turned her nose at anyone of them.”

577
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,560
Without any further consideration,

578
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,800
I’ve decided.

579
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,840
Why couldn’t I be one of them?

580
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,320
I said,

581
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,640
I said, “Miss,”

582
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,280
“I am a soldier from People’s Liberation Army.”

583
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:53,920
“And...”

584
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,840
“I will be promoted”

585
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,840
“after returning army from the vacation.”

586
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,360
“I’ll be a platoon leader.”

587
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,720
“And in my army,”

588
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,440
“I’m the best-looking one.”

589
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,560
At that time,

590
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
at that time I was anxious.

591
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,720
Unexpectedly,

592
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,840
Xiu said,

593
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,800
“Comrade,”

594
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,200
“I’m not seeing anyone.”

595
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,160
“How about”

596
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,160
“we try and date.”

597
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,960
Just like that,

598
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,800
we started our relationship.

599
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,600
Yiye,

600
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,200
I must have done

601
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,400
tons of good deeds all my life,

602
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,600
and was being paid back with luck.

603
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,880
Otherwise I could never meet Xiu.

604
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,440
Xiu completes me.

605
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,280
Yeah.

606
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,720
I always thought that

607
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,440
the reason I joined the army

608
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,640
was for my dream of being a soldier.

609
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,960
It was not until today

610
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,120
when I heard of what Xiu said to you,

611
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,040
I understood the meaning of being a soldier.

612
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,680
My mind was broadened.

613
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,520
What’s that?

614
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,800
We always had a slogan, “support the army and cherish the people”,

615
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,240
which I did not comprehend.

616
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,120
But today when seeing sister-in-law,

617
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,160
I truly comprehend the meaning of “people”.

618
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,080
They trusted us

619
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,440
and relied on us

620
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,480
with all their hearts.

621
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,880
I should never trifle with them,

622
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,760
so as to be worthy of their trusts,

623
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,320
and not disappoint them.

624
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,400
Chief originally thought that,

625
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,080
on behalf of the parents of all the soldiers in the division,

626
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,920
he sent them off.

627
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,960
Therefore he snapped to attention and saluted.

628
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,890
All the soldiers burst into tears,

629
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,160
but not me.

630
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,160
I should not bring disgrace upon the Chief.

631
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,160
What a scene!

632
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,240
Just think of it...

633
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,520
Are you crying?

634
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,480
It’s none of your business.

635
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,480
Okay, none of my business.

636
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,360
I’ll leave you alone.

637
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,840
Little flower Gao Liang!

638
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,240
Why are you calling me that? Didn’t you always call me “Little Rice Gao Liang”?

639
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,360
That’s my choice.

640
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,360
I will call you whatever as I like.

641
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,760
Okay, as you wish.

642
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,160
But can you call me that...?

643
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:04,880
What?

644
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Just that.

645
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,680
What are you thinking?

646
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,120
I did not say anything.

647
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,120
Then what are you going to say?

648
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,360
I’m just saying that

649
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,400
you call me

650
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,440
dear

651
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,160
comrade Gao Liang.

652
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:35,080
[Frontier]

653
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,000
Yiye,

654
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,480
since I

655
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,320
recruited all of you

656
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,400
to our army,

657
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,880
I’ve truly liked you all,

658
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,760
especially you.

659
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,880
In the army,

660
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,160
I’m the platoon leader, and you, the sergeant.

661
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,360
But in private,

662
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,840
I think of you as my brother,

663
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,600
my beloved brother.

664
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,160
I’ll definitely take all the bullets

665
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,800
for you

666
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,280
if we’re in the battlefield.

667
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,520
But you

668
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,800
have to promise me one thing.

669
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:12,920
Anything.

670
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,120
No matter what happens,

671
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,800
you must not die before me.

672
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,720
Okay?

673
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,840
You tell Gao Liang

674
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,160
and the guys.

675
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,800
There are no cowards in our squad.

676
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,080
Whenever you’re in danger,

677
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,600
you have to

678
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,080
hang in there

679
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,320
with your faith.

680
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,000
Platoon Leader,

681
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,080
you have Xiu, haven’t you?

682
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,200
How can I charge into battle

683
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,000
if thinking of her all day long. Besides,

684
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,440
she will laugh at me

685
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,840
for thinking of her all the time.

686
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,480
Prepare to board! Sentry check!

687
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,680
I have to go.

688
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,520
Comrade Gao Liang,

689
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,480
follow the commands, and come back safe.

690
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,920
[One Chinese border]

691
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,880
[Front-line Command of Division 234]

692
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,440
At 3pm on 12nd,

693
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,560
our division will arrive at the place of departure as orders.

694
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,920
And initial attack at 4am on 13rd.

695
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,920
Regiment 702 is in charge of

696
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,040
wiping out the four supporting points of the enemy on the left.

697
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,920
Regiment 700 will capture

698
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,600
enemy’s battle position from the front,

699
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,000
and then attack and seize

700
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,120
position 175 and 286.

701
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,000
Regiment 720 will fight a deep-thrush,

702
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,440
and attack with Regiment 700

703
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,840
from the back,

704
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,160
to make sure that

705
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,680
we can destroy Division 177.

706
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:33,960
Division Commander,

707
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,560
are you worrying about Regiment 720?

708
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,280
Can it be possible

709
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,880
to replace the position of Regiment 720

710
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:42,800
with

711
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,320
Regiment 702?

712
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,840
Regiment 702 will fight a deep-thrush.

713
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,080
Division Commander,

714
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,320
military working group required that

715
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,920
we must protect the flank of Division 230

716
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,240
from being destroyed by the counterattack of the enemy.

717
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,800
I’m afraid that Regiment 720 cannot stop it.

718
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,280
Information from the Command shows that

719
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,920
there is only one reinforced battalion without main force

720
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,360
in the rear of the enemy’s battle position.

721
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,080
Relatively speaking,

722
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,560
fighting a deep-thrush will be easier.

723
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,360
But it’s more dangerous

724
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,760
to attack the rear of the enemy’s battlefield.

725
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,080
Hurry up!

726
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:24,960
Zheng,

727
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,159
you want to speak with me, right?

728
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,239
I want to make a mistake.

729
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,480
For the kid?

730
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,360
I’m worried.

731
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,870
As usual,

732
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,560
harsh words first.

733
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,420
At this point,

734
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,080
the kid cannot be transferred anymore.

735
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,400
I will stop you

736
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,239
even if you want to do that.

737
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,480
Stop talking about the principles.

738
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,560
I won’t.

739
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,840
Alright.

740
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,240
Being a division commander, you are somehow absent-minded.

741
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,080
How can you lead the whole division

742
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,600
without me teaching you a lesson?

743
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,760
Let’s just say that I think of nothing.

744
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,400
No.

745
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,080
Zheng.

746
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,240
I know you how much you love Nanzheng.

747
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,160
You two

748
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,520
are both proud,

749
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,440
and keep all the secrets to yourself.

750
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,680
As a political commissar,

751
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,280
I have no right to blame you.

752
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,160
But as a father,

753
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,080
I have to say that

754
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,040
you are not qualified

755
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,000
to be a father.

756
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,640
Indeed I am.

757
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,080
I am totally messed up upon hearing the sound of the artillery.

758
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,200
Political Commissar,

759
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,000
could it be possible

760
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:47,920
that I trade ten of my lives

761
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,040
with one of my child’s life?

762
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,520
I understand.

763
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,080
I know.

764
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,240
I understand your feeling.

765
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,240
Okay.

766
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,040
Let’s just say that I’ve made a mistake.

767
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,360
Political Commissar,

768
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,520
could you do me a favor?

769
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,600
Could you help check on my kid

770
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,040
while without disturbing

771
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,880
other units?

772
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:18,920
Why don’t you

773
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,320
go check on her yourself?

774
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,520
I can’t.

775
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,000
I’ll be crashed

776
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,400
if she called my dad.

777
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,000
I can’t.

778
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,600
Platoon Leader,

779
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,360
what’s the mission for our platoon?

780
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,400
We did nothing but shouting slogans

781
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,400
in the oath-taking rally, instead of assigning missions.

782
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,640
When will the mission be assigned?

783
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,200
The mission will be assigned from the regiment to battalion, and then the company,

784
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,840
one level at a time.

785
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,440
I have no idea what the mission will be.

786
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,880
We write down our resolution,

787
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,200
and application for battle assignments first.

788
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,680
I think that,

789
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,690
we can pack our necessities packs

790
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,480
up front.

791
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,880
Don’t pack any individual belongings.

792
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:09,520
If you have anything,

793
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:10,830
any money borrowed from others,

794
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,360
return them as soon as you can.

795
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,040
Besides,

00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,600

798
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,280
and buy something to eat.

799
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,280
What does that mean?

800
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,240
Do you think the front-line is nothing but a park,

801
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,000
where you can take a walk there and then go back?

802
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,400
The point is

803
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,600
whether you can come back.

804
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,200
Didn’t Colonel say that

805
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,640
most of the soldiers

806
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,960

807

from the battle years ago?

808
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,320
But the questions is

809
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,300
nobody knows that

810
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,200
whether we are one of the “most soldiers”.

811
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:50,800
Alright,

00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,070

which do you think is better,

817
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,760
“a narrow escape from death”

818
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,000
or “fight with dignity”?

819

“a narrow escape”?

823
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:24,960
That’s not enough.

824
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,600
I’ll risk all of my life.

825
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,640
I’ll write down “die for my country”.

827
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,080
