1
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,210
I wish you a safe return.

2
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,530
Make sure you return safely.

3
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,690
Don't worry, Sergeant Han.

4
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,010
We'll come back.

5
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:34,890
Take care.

6
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:37,530
Thank you for looking after my dad.

7
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:38,930
And

8
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,170
when you're on the battlefield,

9
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,610
take care of yourself.

10
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,250
Don't do anything rash.

11
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,050
You have to come back in one piece.

12
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,170
Otherwise, I won't forgive you.

13
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,050
Did you hear me?

14
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:50,010
Don't worry.

15
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:53,930
Can I

16
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:55,850
also give you a hug?

17
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,130
Shall we say goodbye to each other?

18
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:17,970
Take care.

19
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,090
I mean...

20
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,090
Just like what they did just now.

21
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:28,770
Commander of the Ninth Company.

22
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,370
If

23
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,410
you don't disgrace Chinese soldiers' name,

24
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,050
I'll give you ten hugs

25
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,250
in public

26
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,010
when you return.

27
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:40,810
Yes.

28
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,500
Hurry up!

29
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:55,430
Political Commissar.

30
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,350
Hurry up!

31
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,530
Deputy Division Commander Hu
is leading the Division Command

32
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,770
to Regiment 700.

33
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,170
I'll go down the mountain and have a check.

34
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,290
Don't worry.

35
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,890
No matter where you go,

36
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,250
the Division Command

37
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:06,650
will try our best to have your back.

38
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:07,930
We will never be a drag on you.

39
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,050
Staff Officer Wang,

40
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,450
ask the Communication Company to
install wires for the Division Commander now.

41
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,800
Ensure the telecommunication of
the Division Command. Besides,

42
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,209
tell Zhao Hongying

43
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,810
to send Jiang Nanzheng

44
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,930
to take charge of the telecommunication line
of the Division Command.

45
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:25,970
Yes.

46
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,690
When will the division headquarters
give orders?

47
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,890
The bombing raid just started.

48
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,530
The division has spent a lot this time.

49
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,730
Three goals about the gunfire were achieved
within 60 minutes.

50
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:53,970
There will be three raids.

51
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,570
Then the guns will be fired for a long time.

52
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:56,650
I think

53
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,250
we still have to wait for a while.

54
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:02,920
Sir!

55
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,850
The Command wants us to dispatch two soldiers

56
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,330
to the Communication Company and cover them
while installing wires.

57
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:06,970
Please advise.

58
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,090
Got it.

59
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:08,650
Yes.

60
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:10,410
Who's at the back?

61
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,610
The Ninth Company of the Third Battalion.

62
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,490
Tell Qin Hanyong to send two people there.

63
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,250
Yes.

64
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,210
Do you know what it is?

65
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,170
What's this?

66
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:21,730
You never saw it before

67
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,250
and you don't know it, right?

68
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,850
Honor Grenade.

69
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,530
We have to depend on it
when it's crunch time.

70
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,370
Understand?

71
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,290
Yiye.

72
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,570
Go to the back ravine

73
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,330
with Jiang Weixing.

74
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,010
The Communication Company...

75
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,730
The Communication Company is installing wires
for the Division Command.

76
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,130
The Communication Company?
I'm in. I'll go there.

77
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,570
No.

78
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,090
Why do you always meddle in people's affairs?

79
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:47,650
They don't need a lot of people.

80
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,570
Well, who knows more about
the Communication Company

81
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,250
than me?

82
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,930
I spent over half a year
in the division headquarters.

83
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,730
Besides, we have to install wires
for the Division Command.

84
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,010
If we can't complete the task,

85
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,140
will you be able to take responsibility?

86
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,130
Am I right?

87
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,170
Platoon Leader,

88
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,290
let him go.

89
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,490
OK.

90
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:04,690
Go.

91
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:32,930
Lie down!

92
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:46,930
Stop!

Yellow River.

96
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,450
Do you think I'm an agent?

97
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:52,490
Are you from the Communication Company?

98
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,090
Who is Jiang Nanzheng?

99
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,130
Me!

100
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,290
I'm with the Division Command.

101
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:58,250
Please follow me.

102
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,450
Take care.

Dad.

108
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:54,290
Don't forget to take medicine.

109
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,010
Sir.

110
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,730
Colonel,
the Division Commander is on the line.

111
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,010
This is Chen Dashan.

112
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:39,890
Colonel Chen.

113
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,970
The guns will be fired in ten minutes.

114
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:48,990
[Determination Diagram of Chief 234]

115
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,010
Just launch attacks.

116
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,570
Don't worry about anything

117
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,210
or tangle with our enemies.

118
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,370
Raid at their back.

119
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,890
Destroy their second line of defense.

120
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:50,530
Then

121
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,090
try your best to stop them.

122
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,170
Yes!

123
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,130
This time

124
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,850
you can't make any mistakes.

125
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,330
Otherwise, I'll punish you when we go back.

126
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:02,970
Move.

127
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:03,890

128
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:07,850
Catch up, people who are at the back!
Hurry up!

Colonel.

131
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:29,890
The Sharp Knife Company
has entered the minefield.

132
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,010
There are casualties in the company.

133
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,450
How large is the minefield?

134
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,690
I have no idea now

135
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,610
but the intersection is already filled with

136
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:35,690
pressure land mines and tread land mines.

137

in the Sapper Platoon are injured.

139
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,210
Tell Lu Pingfan

140
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,730
to form a new minesweeping team

141
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:43,530

142
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,930

00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:03,730
to breathe down his neck

155
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:04,890

of the First Company are here.

Why are there also people
of the Communication Company?

Keep going.

163

What happened?

164
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,290
Why is it so bloody?

00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,610
What happened?

168
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,290
Is this the Communication Company?
The Artillery is off the line.

169
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,530
Restore it now. Otherwise,
the army that is in charge of the penetration

170
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,810
will lose artillery support.

00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,930
Their radio has been muted.

176
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,250
We've already missed

177
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,490
three appointed contact times.

178
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,250
I think the line is broken.

179
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,690
But we can't leave them behind.

180
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,210
Let's try to find a solution.

00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:03,770
There are four hours left

00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:04,690
until the next contact time.

00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,210
to find the disconnection point

185
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,530
and fix the line

186
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:10,810
for the Artillery in 30 minutes.

187
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,070
We have to hurry.

188
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,370
Go. This way.

189
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,130
Watch out!

190
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:20,290
- Are you okay?
- You okay?

191
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:21,850
Come on. Let's go.

192
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:39,330
How's it going?

193
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:40,930
It's silent.

194
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:43,530
Sir!

195
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:45,730
Regiment 700 has launched an attack.

196
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,810
The exterior fortification
has already been occupied.

197
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,250
They're attacking the dominant peak.

198
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,130
Tell Leng Rui

199
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,210
not to stop the attack at any time.

200
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,170
Don't let enemies have a chance to rest.

201
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,010
Yes!

202
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,210
Have you spoken to the Artillery?

203
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,730
Sir!

204
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:00,490
Sir!

205
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,330
Not yet.

206
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,290
I've already told the Communication Company
to check the line in groups.

207
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,930
The line will be fixed within half an hour.

208
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,970
Tell me as soon as it's fixed.

209
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:07,490
Yes!

210
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,010
Sergeant.

211
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,130
Sergeant.

212
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:22,970
It's not our wire.

213
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,130
This wire was left in the past.

214
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,330
No, the wire belongs to our enemies.

215
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,730
Jeez! Someone is targeting at us!

216
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:37,890
It's the strafing of the machine gun.

217
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,170
Maybe no one is targeting at us.

218
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,290
But it's not safe here.

219
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:45,490
What are you doing?

220
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:46,810
I'll have a try.

221
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,370
Watch out!

222
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:24,930
Sir!

223
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:25,890
People of the Communication Company

224
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,490
has found a telecommunication line.

225
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,690
The Intelligence Department has monitored
something important.

226
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:30,570
What's it?

227
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:31,690
Enemies estimated that

228
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:32,210
The route between the Highland 36

229
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,490
and the Highland 486

230
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,130
is likely to be the penetration route
of our army.

231
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,050
They've set all kinds of obstacles

232
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,670
and prepared a lot of shells along the route

233
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,590
to shoot.

234
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:40,430
Division Commander.

235
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,150
Regiment 720 will suffer a lot.

236
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,630
Try your best to

237
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,030
contact the Artillery.

238
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,110
Stop our enemies from firing.

239
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:48,310
Besides,

240
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,430
ask the military

241
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,550
to give abundant shells
to the Third Artillery Division.

242
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,110
Destroy the enemy artillery position.

243
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:53,670
Yes!

244
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,170
Division Commander,

245
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,270
we haven't got the location

246
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,350
of the enemy artillery position yet.

247
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,670
What's wrong with the Reconnaissance Company?

248
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:58,750
Two of their radios

249
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,790
were destroyed during the penetration.

250
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,230
Xia Lin ran with five people.

251
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,230
On their way back, one of them died.

252
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,790
They met the Sharp Knife Company
of Regiment 720 by chance.

253
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,150
However,
they entered a large minefield later.

254
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,550
In order to go back early,

255
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,630
they just crossed the minefield.

256
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,910
Then four of them died.

257
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,790
Only one of them came back alive.

258
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,030
Find all the suspicious

259
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,510
gun emplacements

260
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,430
on Regiment 720's way.

261
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,470
Fire them off.

262
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,750
Exchange shells for our soldiers' life.

263
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,270
Use all the scouting methods.

264
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,590
If we miss an enemy out,

265
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,230
I'll only allow him to fire for one round.

266
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,310
After he fires for a round,

267
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:24,590
spare no effort to fight back.

268
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,310
Yes!

269
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,230
Company Commander,

270
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,790
the first two vanguards are safe.

271
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:50,830
The main force can pass now.

272
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:52,670
Leader of the First Platoon.

273
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,150
Go.

274
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,430
Disperse! Take cover!

275
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,550
Pull the wounded back! Pull them back!

276
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,070
The top right corner!

277
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,550
Fire suppression!

278
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,630
Company Commander.

279
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,950
We've been surrounded.

280
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,390
When?

281
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,510
Dispatch the main force.

282
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,630
How can they surround us?

283
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,550
I think there's a group of
enemies who left the main force.

284
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:46,390
Commissar,

285
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,550
I'll lead the Third Platoon to the front.

286
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,190
You lead the First Platoon at the back.

287
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,230
- OK!
- Leader of the First Platoon, let's go!

288
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,510
Medic!

289
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,710
Medic!

290
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,150
What are you doing?

291
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:54,990
Hongliu.

292
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,670
Are you okay?

293
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,350
Hongliu.

294
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,030
You okay?

295
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:05,750
I'm fine.

296
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,430
Jiang, stay with Hongliu.

297
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,150
Take care of him.

298
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:08,870
OK.

299
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:11,990
Are you okay?

300
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:12,550
I'm fine.

301
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,390
Beihai, are you okay?

302
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,550
When the auxiliary force reaches here,

303
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,310
go down.

304
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:19,870
Did you hear me?

305
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:20,830
No, I won't.

306
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,150
I'm totally fine.

307
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,790
You're totally fine? Your legs are broken!

308
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,630
There are enemies!

309
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,350
Go! Disperse!

310
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,110
Get out! If you give your gun to us,
we'll keep you alive.

311
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,550
Get out! If you give your gun to us,
we'll keep you alive!

312
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,770
Don't shoot.

313
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,230
It's me,

314
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,150
Gao Liang.

315
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,630
Gao Liang?

316
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,910
Gao Liang, are you there?

317
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,110
Yes, it's me!

318
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,350
Hurry up! Move.

319
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,830
Hurry up! Help me!

320
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,510
You really surprised us.

321
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,790
How's it going in the cave?

322
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,510
You know what?

323
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,990
There are several living people.

324
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,390
They almost throttled me.

325
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,950
If I used the Honor Grenade,

326
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,230
who could save my life?

327
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:11,910
You really surprised us.

328
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,070
Go back to your position.

329
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,230
Strengthen the fortification.

330
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,110
After enemies retreat,

331
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,070
we'll have to fight again.

332
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,670
Disperse, everyone!

333
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,070
Jiang,

334
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:31,830
now

335
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,390
the picture of
a young female soldier is your treasure.

336
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:33,870
Give it to me.

337
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,230
The war has changed you.

338
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,450
Maybe

339
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,590
it's because we hugged
before leaving each other

340
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,150
or her picture

341
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,590
was just put

342
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,630
so close to my head.

343
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,670
I started to have feelings for her.

344
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,070
I think

345
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,310
if I get injured,

346
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,630
she'll be the person

347
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,150
who touches my head.

348
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,950
When I come back as a winner,

349
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,150
she'll be the person

350
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,030
who stands by the triumphal arch,

351
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,790
kissing

352
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,190
and hugging me.

353
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,110
When I die,

354
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,670
there will be someone

355
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,230
on my mind.

356
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,110
It's also her.

357
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:43,710
Gu.

358
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,590
It's just that

359
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,270
you're really good at bragging.

360
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,390
Honestly, since you're so good at bragging,

361
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,990
I believe you'll be the sergeant
of the Ninth Squad.

362
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,510
Deputy Colonel.

363
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,190
Yes.

364
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,910
Tell the Ninth Company

365
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,670
that they're in the main position.

366
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:00,750
Make sure they defend it.

367
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:01,750
Don't give an inch.

368
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:02,470
OK.

369
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:08,630
Colonel.

370
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:09,630
How's it going down the mountain?

371
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,990
All companies are strengthening
their fortifications.

372
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,590
There are so many enemies' bodies left.

373
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,150
I've asked them to collect the bodies,

374
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,270
cover the bodies with tarps

375
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,510
and put marks.

376
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,830
After enemies come up to us,

377
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,270
let them bury the bodies.

378
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:23,830
How many soldiers did we lose?

379
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,470
34 deaths

380
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,150
and 91 injuries.

381
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,630
In midstream,

382
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,310
13 soldiers got lost.

383
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,110
They got lost, huh?

384
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,110
All of them are from the First Company.

385
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,790
What's wrong with Lu Pingfan?

386
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,190
Tell him to find them!

387
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,030
Find all of them!

388
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,230
The First Company is the vanguard company.

389
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,710
There are a lot of casualties.

390
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,630
Besides soldiers of the Sapper Platoon,

391
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,670
all the other dead people belonged
to the First Company.

392
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,150
I'm afraid that no one is available.

393
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,990
The distance between the site
and the Ninth Company is the shortest.

394
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,350
We have to dispatch them.

395
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,590
Send two squads to look for them.

396
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,870
Take all of them back!

397
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,270
Yes!

398
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,710
Sergeant of the Ninth Squad.

399
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,030
Swap your position with Sergeant Wang's.

400
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,270
You

401
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,230
take your squad

402
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,830
and the Seventh Squad

403
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,190
back.

404
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,430
Back? Where should we go?

405
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,190
I mean the route that we took

406
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,070
when we penetrated deep into
enemy lines yesterday.

407
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,270
Go back.

408
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:36,950
Yesterday,

409
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,670
13 soldiers of the First Company lagged.

410
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,670
I think some of them were dead
and others were wounded.

411
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,030
Our supervisors ordered us

412
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,150
to find them.

413
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,510
This task will be assigned to your squad

414
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,870
and the Seventh Squad.

415
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:48,910
Sergeant of
the Seventh Squad will be the leader.

416
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:50,750
I'm not going.

417
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,230
Ask others to perform this task.

418
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,110
Why?

419
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,230
We've been fighting for a long time.

420
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,710
We're finally here.

421
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,830
We're desperate to fight against our enemies.

422
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,390
Now you tell me to go back.

423
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:03,630
How can I go back?

424
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:07,480
Gu Yiye,

425
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,350
is it the time to bargain?

426
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,070
Just perform the task.

427
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,390
No, I'm not going.

428
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:17,590
I'll stay here.

429
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,390
Yiye is right.

430
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,430
We can't go back.

431
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,270
We're vanguards.

432
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,390
We have to stand at the front.

433
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,190
Ask other squads to rescue people.

434
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,150
What?

435
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,790
Are you rebelling against me?

436
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,030
The situation is critical.

437
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:38,430
Listen,

438
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:39,880
you have to go

439
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,390
even if you want to stay here.

440
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,230
Let me replace the sergeant of
the Seventh Squad. I'll be the leader.

441
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,430
Let's depart in ten minutes!

442
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:45,590
Get ready!

443
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,070
Colonel, look at the dominant peak!

444
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,030
Attention, companies.

445
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:09,790
This is Chen Dashan.

446
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,350
Regiment 700

447
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,790
has already occupied the position
of the dominant peak.

448
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,670
Soon enemies will retreat.

449
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,230
It's time for Regiment 720

450
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,550
to bleed and die

451
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,790
for our country.

452
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:20,590
I order

453
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:21,750
cadres

454
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,750
and members of the Chinese Communist Party
of all companies to serve in the front line.

455
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,550
Members of the Communist Youth League
of China serve at the second line.

456
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,150
Defend our positions till we die.

457
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,950
Stop every enemy

458
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,150
from passing.

459
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:25,430
Where are you from?

460
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,550
We're from the Third Squad
of the First Company.

461
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,350
Our company commander is Lu Pingfan.

462
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:30,860
We had fought with
people of your Ninth Company

463
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,710
in the bathhouse.

464
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,230
Bro, leave it to me.

465
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,390
Where are other people of your squad?

466
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:49,710
We lost each other.

467
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:56,910
Can you walk?

468
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:58,470
Yes.

469
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:03,990
Drink some water.

470
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:08,190
Don't swallow it. Spit it out.

471
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,510
You'll be chocked.

472
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:14,310
I remember you.

473
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,470
You were hit by me.

474
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:17,870
I remember it.

475
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,150
I remember that when you lay on the ground,

476
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,070
I kicked you twice.

477
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,310
I should have brought canned oranges.

478
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,150
If I eat them now,

479
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,430
I'll be very happy.

480
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,230
If I also have chili sauce,

481
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,070
it'll be better.

482
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,830
The situation is critical

483
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,030
but you're still thinking about food.

484
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:40,870
Drink some water.

485
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:45,470
Can you walk?

486
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,270
Yes.

487
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,190
I promise

488
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,070
I'll take you back to the army

489
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,070
in one piece.

490
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:54,390
Help him get up.

491
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,030
Yes.

492
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,630
Let's go. Go.

493
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,270
Platoon Leader, where are we?

494
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:35,750
I think

495
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,630
we're in Lijiagou now.

496
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,070
The distance between here and the place

497
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:39,790
where there was an ambush yesterday

498
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,470
is within 5 kilometers.

499
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:41,870
We've already here.

500
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:42,710
Did the remaining two soldiers

501
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,030
backtrack?

502
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,670
Some of our soldiers

503
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,030
died

504
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,830
and others hid somewhere after got injured.

505
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,270
Even if they died,

506
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,830
we have to find their bodies.

507
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,470
Otherwise, we'll let their parents down.

508
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,110
We have to take them back.

509
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:55,870
Dudes,

510
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:56,950
follow me. Follow me!

511
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:07,950
Take cover!

512
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:14,150
Disperse, everyone! Don't gather!

513
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,590
Take cover!

514
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:45,870
Take cover!

515
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,470
Take cover!

516
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:48,590
Take cover! Take cover!

517
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,230
Platoon Leader!

518
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,270
Enemies are too powerful.

519
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,909
They have 12.7 Anti-aircraft Guns.

520
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,230
They can keep firing.

521
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:11,230
Don't tangle with them.

522
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:12,110
Retreat now!

523
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:25,070
We can't retreat.

524
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,150
Why? Why can't we retreat?

525
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:32,270
The main force passed here yesterday.

526
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:34,310
It's dark at that time.

527
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,870
Enemies dared not move.

528
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,389
Now Regiment 700

529
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,630
has occupied the dominant peak.

530
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,070
There are a lot of enemies who retreated
on the way.

531
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,070
But we only have 30 people.

532
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,790
As soon as guns were fired,
we couldn't go back anymore.

533
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:14,470
Hongliu! Take cover!

534
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,990
Hongliu!

535
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:41,750
Platoon Leader.

536
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:42,630
Cover the wounded

537
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,550
and retreat with the Seventh Squad.

538
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:45,430
The Ninth Squad and me

539
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:46,870
will cover you at the back.

540
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:50,190
Listen!

541
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,030
Soldiers of the Ninth Squad can run fast.

542
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,430
Retreat with the Ninth Squad.

543
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,950
I'll cover you with the Seventh Squad.

544
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:54,950
Platoon Leader!

545
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,870
Stop talking! Obey my order!

546
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,710
Beihai!

547
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,390
Cover me!

548
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,590
Sergeant Mao!

549
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,150
Enemies are firing!

550
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,110
Lie down!

551
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:19,850
Sergeant.

552
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,110
Has the line there been fixed?

553
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,190
No.

554
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,150
Gao!

555
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:29,150
Where's our fire support?

556
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,630
Are we gonna die here?

557
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,670
It's fixed! It's fixed!

558
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,670
Chief,
the telecommunication has been restored!

559
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,830
Order the Artillery to fire

560
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:13,830
in Area 3.

561
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:14,670
Yes!

562
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:39,950
Our support is here!

563
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,150
Let's go!

564
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,510
Platoon Leader!

565
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,510
Cover me!

566
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:14,670
Platoon Leader!

567
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:24,190
Platoon Leader!

568
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:24,910
Medic!

569
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,310
Somebody help!

570
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,190
Please help me stop bleeding!

571
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,270
Platoon Leader.

572
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,550
Go with them.

573
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,790
Go away!

574
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:55,110
Go.

575
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,190
Don't worry, Platoon Leader.

576
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:57,790
I'm here.

577
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:58,750
Don't worry.

578
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,230
Give them to me. Give them to me.

579
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:04,830
Give them to me.

580
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,150
Give your guns to me.

581
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:09,950
Gao Liang! What are you doing?

582
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:12,950
I'll divert enemies' firepower.

583
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,630
No! It's too dangerous!

584
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:15,790
Let's do it!

585
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,710
Otherwise, none of us will be able to leave!

586
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:20,070
Gao Liang, I order you to stop!

587
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:21,790
I have no family or friends.

588
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,950
Take our soldiers back!

589
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,150
Gao Liang!

590
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,470
Gao!

591
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,510
Where are you going?

592
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,430
Mom,

593
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:42,990
I'm sorry.

594
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,030
In your next life...

595
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,030
In your next life, please wait for me!

596
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:57,070
Retreat!

597
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,550
Fire at me!
