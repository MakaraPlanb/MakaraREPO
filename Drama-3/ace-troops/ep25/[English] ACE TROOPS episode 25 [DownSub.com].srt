121
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,800

00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,320
What does that have to do with the disease?

192
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,360
Certificate of Outstanding Student.

193
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,680
You are the only one in the unit.

194
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,280
With this,

195
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,960
you don’t have to be a second lieutenant.

196
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,040
You’ll graduate as a first lieutenant.

197
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,580
[Certificate of Outstanding Student]

198
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,240
Is that so?

199
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,520
I’m the only one?

200
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,200
Uh, did Gu Yiye

201
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,320
not get one?

202
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,040
Gu Yiye gave up in the Red Wolf Exercise,

203
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,000
disqualifying himself as an Outstanding Student.

204
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,040
However,

205
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,960
he’s the only one who won the White Wolf Exercise,

206
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,480
but that doesn’t count.

207
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,160
What is he thinking about?

208
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,480
He has a different level of horizon,

209
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,080
and he sees a different word from us.

210
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,120
Do you mean that

211
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,840
I, the Outstanding Student,

212
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,040
has a narrower horizon than that fall-behind?

213
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,800
Let me put it this way.

214
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,000
Scout.

215
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,920
It’s an insignificant major.

216
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,720
Only one kind of person likes it.

217
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,160
Boys.

218
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,640
Some people are boys for life.

219
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,400
They don’t care about

220
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,680
big unit or small unit,

221
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,080
big troop or small troop.

222
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,560
They just like adventure,

223
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,520
and they are suitable scouts.

224
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,600
Then Gu Yiye is not suitable.

225
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,680
Many are not.

226
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,440
However,

227
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,440
what makes me admire Gu Yiye

228
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,600
is that he could have avoided the question,

229
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,040
but he didn’t.

230
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,800
He went so far as sacrificing his future

231
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,960
just to solve

232
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,240
the question that is not suitable for him.

233
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,000
You can’t say he’s

234
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,320
utilitarian.

235
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,360
He’s definitely not.

236
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,760
He’s just showing off.

237
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,960
But to whom?

238
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,680
It doesn’t matter.

239
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,080
You just mind your own business.

240
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,400
Tonight,

241
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,640
our school and the Communication Academy

242
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,080
are having a prom together.

243
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,040
If you don’t have a girlfriend yet,

244
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,480
it will be the chance.

245
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,120
Nanzheng.

246
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,600
Did Gao Liang come and look for you?

247
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,600
You know that, Sergeant.

248
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,240
After I was appointed as the Unit Leader,

249
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,120
there are lots of studies, management,

250
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,400
business communication from in and out of the academy,

251
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,320
and expanding communication.

252
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,800
All these left me no time

253
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,680
even to cut my hair.

254
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,800
In holidays,

255
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,120
I’ll go to the military and do technical service.

256
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,320
From plateaus to islands,

257
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,680
I basically walked through every meter

258
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,000
of the north borderline.

259
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,280
It’s tough,

260
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,520
but it’s full.

261
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,240
That’s why I rarely gave you thought report.

262
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,480
Don’t blame me for it.

263
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,720
Blame? I’m proud

264
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,080
for having a soldier like you.

265
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,280
Congratulation on getting the Outstanding Student title.

266
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,600
Thanks, Sergeant.

267
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,720
And that’s why

268
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,240
I rarely contact Gao Liang and the guys.

269
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,880
Actually,

270
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,240
Gaoliang came to me when you broke up

271
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,120
with Gu Yiye.

272
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,320
He told me that

273
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,720
He wanted to openly pursue you.

274
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,560
I know in fact

275
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,560
that it’s his way of rejecting me.

276
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,520
I’m sorry, Sergeant.

277
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,640
It’s not your fault.

278
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,200
I always know

279
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,720
that we’re not meant for each other.

280
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,160
I know that his mind is on you.

281
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,720
But you know me.

282
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,560
I just have to fight for it

283
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,560
no matter the outcome.

284
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,360
Gao Liang always takes me as a sister.

285
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,880
I’m good

286
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,080
with such a brother.

287
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,360
However,

288
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,080
Nanzheng,

289
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,280
Gao Liang is the boy that knows about love most that I know.

290
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,400
You and he...

291
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,400
Sergeant.

292
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,120
Actually I think now

293
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,840
that there’s more

294
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,440
than love

295
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,480
in one’s life.

296
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,040
Some feelings that is greater than love

297
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,200
is also beautiful.

298
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,120
Maybe even more beautiful.

299
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,440
I just think that

300
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,200
people

301
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,960
sometimes can be greedy.

302
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,040
They forget what are by their side,

303
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,200
what they already have,

304
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,880
and crave

305
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,120
for those they don’t have.

306
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,240
If you think about those around us,

307
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,680
those who are nice to us,

308
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,760
and think about what we have already got,

309
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,600
it’s really a lot.

310
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,320
So we must know to cherish.

311
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,440
To be content.

312
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,320
And we are people

313
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,680
that walked through the battlefield.

314
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,040
We experienced life and death.

315
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,720
What is more precious

316
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,880
than the friendship

317
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,320
of comrades-in-arms?

318
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,220
[Rhythm of youth; Happy barrack.]

319
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,400
Let’s dance, Chunyu.

320
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,760
I can’t dance.

321
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,760
Sergeant is a good dancer!

322
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,960
Come on, come on.

323
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,140
[Rhythm of youth; Happy barrack.]

324
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,520
Gao Liang.

325
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,200
You were lying.

326
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,720
What did I lie about?

327
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,360
You said that

328
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,960
you were going to ask me out in public.

329
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,760
Did I?

330
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:10,880
Keep lying.

331
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,560
You’re so full of it.

332
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,280
Denying is doubly guilty.

333
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,800
I heard that

334
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,280
you are a love expert now,

335
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,600
and knows how to pursue girls well.

336
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,440
You’ve helped the guys in your team

337
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,080
trick lots of girls in our Communication Academy.

338
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,240
They are all byproducts.

339
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,160
They are all byproducts of me studying

340
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,680
war and psychology.

341
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,280
By regarding love relationships

342
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,800
as a

343
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,560
goal-oriented war

344
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,400
with people attacking,

345
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,160
seesawing,

346
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,200
assaulting

347
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,920
and defending,

348
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,520
strategies and tactics emerge from nowhere.

349
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,000
It’s not my own intentions knowing this kind of stuff.

350
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,280
I was poisoned.

351
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,600
Have you ever used these strategies and tactics

352
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,080
on me?

353
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,120
If I could,

354
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,720
I would blow your heart open

355
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,840
with all the atomic bombs in the world.

356
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,800
In relationships,

357
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,240
you can always

358
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,600
be analytical and logical being a bystander.

359
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,520
But when it comes to your own relationship,

360
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,760
not one logic would work anymore.

361
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:08,200
Gao Liang,

362
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,680
you’ve been a changed man.

363
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,520
You too.

364
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,760
We both are.

365
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,920
Yeah,

366
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,040
we’ve both changed.

367
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,280
That’s not bad.

368
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,440
Life is indeed a changing process.

369
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,960
What does your train leave?

370
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,880
I’ll drop you by the station.

371
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,920
I’ve checked it out.

372
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,200
We are in the same train.

373
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,360
What?

374
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,120
Is it okay for your reconnaissance on me,

375
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,720
while not for my counter reconnaissance?

376
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,040
Do you remember what happened five years ago?

377
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:49,960
Yeah.

378
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,080
I still have

379
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,600
the tiger cowrie back then.

380
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,040
Something

381
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,880
will never change.

382
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,760
Like what?

383
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,520
Like...

384
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,640
I will always like a girl named Jiang Nanzheng.

385
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,920
Nothing will change it.

386
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,360
Aren’t you curious about

387
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,800
where Mule Gu was assigned?

388
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,000
Where?

389
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,200
He was assigned to Night Tiger Company, as what he wished.

390
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,840
It seems that you are truly relieved now,

391
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,320
not avoiding his name.

392
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,600
I think

393
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,080
time is a great healer for everything.

394
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,760
Nanzheng,

395
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,840
there’s something

396
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,800
I’m going to tell you now.

397
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,520
Gu Yiye did not break up with you

398
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,280
for the reason he said.

399
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,880
It’s because of Xiu and the baby.

400
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,360
The baby?

401
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,400
Yes.

402
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,320
Gu Yiye went to eastern Guangdong

403
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,680
when the school just began.

404
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,720
He found out that

405
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,160
Zhang Fei’s mother was badly ill.

406
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,400
Xiu could not hold it

407
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,480
with a little baby to raise.

408
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,200
It was really tough

409
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,480
and painful for him

410
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,640
to make a choice like this.

411
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,320
I knew.

412
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,560
You knew?

413
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,200
The truth

414
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,680
is just like a sword

415
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,640
which draws a think wound.

416
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,280
But the reality is like a blunt knife

417
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,440
which brings wrenching pains.

418
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,840
What could I possibly do knowing the truth?

419
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,240
Who could help out

420
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,280
Xiu and her family?

421
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,040
Didn’t you want to

422
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,000
talk to Gu Yiye and find out?

423
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,840
I wouldn’t ask

424
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,400
if he decided not to tell me.

425
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,480
It was a kind of

426
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,560
mutual understanding between him and me.

427
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,240
This mutual understanding

428
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,920
made me feel

429
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,120
kind of noble.

430
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,480
I wanted to hold on to this nobility.

431
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:28,020
[Three years later]

432
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,440
A Company that was once behind other companies

433
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,720
fought through obstacles again and again,

434
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,440
which drove the construction of Regiment 720.

435
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,720
This report seems inspiring indeed.

436
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,680
Chief, you taught us well.

437
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,720
And,

438
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,000
we’re in a good time.

439
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,360
I believe that

440
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,320
after this

441
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,560
unprecedented structural reform

442
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,840
and slimming,

443
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,560
our army,

444
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,240
especially Army A,

445
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,800
will have much more younger soldiers.

446
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,840
I didn’t have time

447
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,280
to congratulate you.

448
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,960
Congratulations for Chief being promoted to Army Commander!

449
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,280
Song Jianshe.

450
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,320
Yes, sir!

451
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,000
Why do you come to me today?

452
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,760
I want somebody.

453
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,640
Who?

454
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,640
Gao Liang.

455
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,360
Isn’t he the Commander of Reconnaissance Company

456
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,040
in Division 234 now?

457
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,320
Deputy Company Commander.

458
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,520
Quite slow.

459
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,840
Why do you want him?

460
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,880
Back to Regiment 720 and be the Commander of the Ninth Company.

461
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,520
You two!

462
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:24,720
What are you looking at?

463
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,680
All of you! Keep on training!

464
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,880
Song Jianshen,

465
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,480
you’re bypassing the immediate leadership.

466
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,040
You should apply this

467
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,200
to your Division Commander.

468
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,520
I did.

469
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,800
He disagreed.

470
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,880
Why?

471
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,600
He said that Gao Liang was trained by you.

472
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,520
Without your consent,

473
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,560
he wouldn’t dare to make the decision.

474
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,200
What a Chen Dashan!

475
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,920
Learning nothing

476
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,560
but flattery.

477
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,800
You two don’t care about Red Arrow Exercise

478
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,160
but only flattering the higher-ups.

479
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,240
Report, Chief!

480
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,640
The reason I want Gao Liang

481
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,800
is for Red Arrow Exercise.

482
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,920
We all know that

483
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,840
you put more emphasis on the exercise.

484
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:21,800
To be honest,

485
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,160
Regiment 720

486
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,840
is under a lot of pressure.

487
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,160
The Ninth Company is the focus of this exercise,

488
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,240
let alone the fact that it was trained by you.

489
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,280
It is considered as the model of military training.

490
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,880
As the saying goes,

491
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,720
the leading sheep in the herd is the most important.

492
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,480
Communist Party Committee, after thorough investigation,

493
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,840
believed that the strongest Company Commander

494
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,320
is a must-do

495
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,640
to keep the Ninth Company stand up well.

496
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,360
Besides,

497
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,320
Gao Liang has been a Deputy Company Commander for almost four years.

498
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,440
He’s been trained and tested for too long.

499
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,720
It’s no good

500
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,320
for his improvement

501
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,840
if not promoted him sooner.

502
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,600
Most importantly, we all think that

503
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,640
Chief is a man of principle,

504
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,840
and really strict

505
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,520
to your soldiers.

506
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,360
Therefore nobody dares to apply

507
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,800
for promoting Gao Liang in front of you.

508
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,600
They are wise enough

509
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,760
not to be scolded.

510
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,160
Song Jianshe,

511
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,920
as you said,

512
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,680
I have absolutely no reason

513
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,960
to agree your application of transferring Gao Liang.

514
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,160
I agree.

515
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,760
Yes, sir!

516
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,280
Thanks, Chief.

517
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,480
Leader of the Third Platoon!

518
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,440
Yes, sir!

519
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,320
Lead the training.

520
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:36,960
Yes, sir!

521
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,480
Which division are you from?

522
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,880
Stop pretending, Gao Liang.

523
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,920
Cut it out. I already fell for someone.

524
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,280
Her name is Jiang Nanzheng.

525
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,400
You may be a bit prettier than her,

526
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,040
but I wouldn’t do anything wrong to her.

527
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,120
You two!

528
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,200
What are you looking at?

529
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,200
Okay, I’ll take it.

530
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,280
It’s for you.

531
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,280
What is it?

532
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,480
Stop smelling. It’s scentless.

533
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,360
It’s from Fiery Cross Reef.

534
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,120
The flowers are of tough vitality,

535
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,040
blooming whenever there’s sunlight.

536
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,880
It’s named sunflower by the soldiers.

537
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,360
Isn’t it just like me,

538
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,280
blooming with a ray of sunlight, right?

539
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,040
Don’t get all clever with me.

540
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,360
Have you seen Army Commander?

541
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,920
The old man was more informed than you.

542
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,320
He picked me up upon my arrival to Naval Port.

543
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,840
The old man was not loyal,

544
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,400
keeping this information to himself.

545
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,520
Alright,

546
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,920
I will have sources to all your information

547
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,200
after being a Chief.

548
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,520
Are you going to military office?

549
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,880
What’s the fun in military office?

550
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,040
I like being in command of troops.

551
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,440
I’m going back to the Ninth Company and be the Company Commander.

552
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,920
Congratulations, Company Commander Gao!

553
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,520
I couldn’t say no even if I didn’t want to.

554
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,480
Red Arrow Exercise in the Army

555
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,440
is about to begin.

556
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,240
Regiment 720 has nobody to lead the team,

557
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,560
thus transferring me back.

558
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,080
Who did that?

559
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,160
Song Jianshe.

560
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,680
He’s now a Colonel.

561
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,160
Song Jianshe is a Colonel?

562
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,440
Deputy Colonel for now.

563
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,480
He’ll be the principal Colonel after this exercise.

564
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,600
Then behave yourself.

565
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,680
We made him a lot of troubles in New Recruit Company.

566
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,760
That is true.

567
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,360
Have you seen Mule Gu?

568
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,680
Not yet.

569
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,480
How is he?

570
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,040
Night Tiger Company. Outstanding.

571
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,720
But he and Xiu...

572
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,720
just like old times, unmarried.

573
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,120
Why?

574
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,600
Mother Zhang passed away.

575
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,080
Based on the customs of their hometown,

576
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,120
they have to observe a three-year mourning period.

577
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,600
This year...this year is the third year.

578
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,360
Okay.

579
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,240
Come with me to our company. Let’s go.

580
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,360
Deputy Company Commander,

581
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,560
fighting!

582
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,320
Come in.

583
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:57,700
[Value the honor, be the best.]

584
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,700
[1st Place]

585
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,000
Sit here.

586
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,400
Deputy Company Commander, what about Miss Chief

587
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,480
staying for dinner?

588
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,960
Yeah, we can add more dishes.

589
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,400
Deputy Company Commander,

590
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,600
I can go to the market and shop for food.

591
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,680
Stop it.

592
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,360
You want more training, don’t you?

593
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,440
Hurry back.

594
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,160
Remember to stay for dinner!

595
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,720
I kind of like it here in the company of community-level.

596
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,240
And you...

597
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,760
you’re now the Chief of major military office.

598
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,200
You being here

599
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,720
is no less than inspection work.

600
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,720
Besides, you’re major in

601
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,360
the weak spot of our Army.

602
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,840
You are exactly the talent strengthening our weak spot.

603
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,680
Aren’t you tired of talking like a bureaucrat?

604
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,920
Exhausted. It’s your turn to talk practically.

605
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,320
I remember when I first arrived in Communication Company,

606
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,520
we were practicing connecting lines

607
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,720
day and night.

608
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,480
Nothing could go wrong even when we were eating, sleeping and with our eyes closed.

609
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,720
But current fully automatic system

610
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,200
has knocked out all the manual work.

611
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,280
I don’t feel sad for myself.

612
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,840
I just feel that

613
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,920
there’s a sense of urgency and crisis.

614
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,000
In the old man Zheng’s words,

615
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,360
the video tape of desert storm

616
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
gives us goose bumps whenever we watch it.

617
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,240
Having watched it for a hundred times

618
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,280
is just like taking a hundred times of cold bath

619
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,960
in winter nights.

620
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,960
Missiles aside,

621
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,360
armoured units, in the sandstorm with merely a few meters of visibility,

622
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,720
marched forward for hundreds of miles.

623
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,760
I would never believe it if not watching it with my own eyes.

624
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,280
Yeah.

625
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,000
Who would have thought that this was what modern warfare looked like?

626
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,720
The development of foreign armies

627
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,280
is a lot faster than we thought.

628
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,960
The development of our military technology

629
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,240
is even much farther behind than we thought.

630
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,960
We have to keep up.

631
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,000
Then you chase after the technology.

632
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,040
I chase after you.

633
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,880
Don’t make jokes. I’m being serious here.

634
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,040
I’m not joking. I’m being serious as well.

635
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,600
I don’t have enough knowledge on this.

636
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,760
Therefore,

637
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,160
I want to go on with further study.

638
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,880
Military District asked me to study

639
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,640
in National University of Defense Technology with my subject,

640
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,760
and learn more about computer technology

641
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,160
and information networks,

642
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,120
so as to better serve the army

643
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,080
and transfer knowledge into combat effectiveness.

644
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,120
Then I can do good things for you guys in community-level.

645
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,640
Nanzheng, I am awestruck by

646
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,280
your field of vision

647
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,040
and awareness.

648
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,120
Give me a chance to farewell to you.

649
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,560
Don’t you dare leave without saying.

650
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,040
Or I’ll be definitely through with you.

651
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,600
Gao Liang,

652
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,680
thanks for being so good to me.

653
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,920
No, no.

654
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,320
You don’t have to force yourself to accept me.

655
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,560
I enjoy seeing you

656
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,800
living a wonderful

657
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,720
and happy life.

658
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,560
I’ll be delighted on your happiness.

659
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,720
It’s my own business of adoring you.

660
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,720
Really?

661
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,000
I heard that you have a boyfriend now.

662
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,280
You’re spying on me.

663
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,800
Tell me,

664
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,440
what else do you know?

665
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,120
Nothing.

666
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,160
I don’t buy it.

667
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,760
To be honest,

668
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,040
I am planning of getting married.

669
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,360
Yeah?

670
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,920
After all these years,

671
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,400
looking back,

672
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,560
you found the man you loved standing in the lights, didn’t you?

673
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,680
I...

674
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,920
am going to get married with

675
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,520
information technology.

676
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,000
What did you just say?

677
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,600
Deputy Company Commander,

678
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,120
all the soldiers in our Company don’t want you to go.

679
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,560
Several of them went crying in my place.

680
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,560
I’m getting promoted as principal Company Commander.

681
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,080
Why are you all crying?

682
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,120
A bunch of sissies.

683
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,000
Lei!

684
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,560
Lei, what’s wrong? Lei!

685
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,240
Stop. Pull over!

686
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,040
Lei, wake up! Lei!

687
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,920
Don’t die, Lei!

688
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,040
Mouth-to-mouth.

689
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,920
Come on, hold his nose and lift up his chin.

690
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,600
Breath into it.

691
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,680
Let him do it!

692
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,680
Breath!

693
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,560
Lei.

694
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,120
You two

695
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,560
were from the Ninth Company.

696
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:58,600
Yes, sir.

697
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,880
What are you doing here?

698
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,080
We were asked to take a day off,

699
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,720
thus we were fishing here.

700
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,360
What do you mean by asking you to take a day off?

701
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,440
How come you need to take a day off?

702
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,600
The Ninth Company is the advanced Company.

703
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,520
We are both bad at boxing and shooting,

704
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,090
and will drag our Company down.

705
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:16,530
Therefore whenever there are people visiting,

706
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,010
Commander asked us to take the day off

707
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,240
and go fishing here.

708
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,400
Yes.

709
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,960
Your Commander is so stupid.

710
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,120
He can just transfer you two.

711
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,200
He doesn’t want us to leave.

712
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,480
For real.

713
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,760
Because you can fish well?

714
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,000
We were main players

715
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,960
in the school table tennis team before joining the army.

716
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,590
Our Company is counting on us

717
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,560
to win the National Table Tennis Competition.

718
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,680
And you are?

719
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,480
I’m your new Company Commander.

720
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,960
You’re Commander Gao.

721
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:44,140
[Unit 53082 of People's Liberation Army]

722
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,160
Report!

723
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,360
Come in.

724
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,760
Deputy Company Commander Gao Liang from Reconnaissance Company is reporting for duty!

725
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,240
Sit down, please.

726
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,040
Yes, sir.

727
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:57,920
Great.

728
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,120
I’ve harassed the Division headquarter

729
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,480
for three times, just for you.

730
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,240
They did not approve my application even if I traded three Commanders in Training Company

731
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,400
for you only.

732
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,560
Do you know why I went through all these troubles?

733
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,080
I don’t know.

734
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,080
Thanks, Colonel.

735
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,480
You see,

736
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,280
we can do the math

737
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,360
and know that the three of them

738
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,880
are surely better than one of you.

739
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,000
However,

740
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,400
if you can accomplish

741
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,560
the mission that the three Commanders can’t,

742
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,720
then others

743
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,040
are ordinary soldiers,

744
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,360
while you are the ace.

745
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,200
Colonel, don’t say that.

746
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,360
They would never leave me alone if hearing your words.

747
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,280
In the movie Decisive Engagement,

748
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,480
there’s a line goes as,

749
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,400
“I don’t need the casualty figures.”

750
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,920
“I just need Tashan.”

751
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,440
The model of the Ninth Company

752
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,240
can never go down.

753
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,720
Regiment 720 can never lose in Red Arrow Exercise.

754
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,240
This is your battle of Tashan.

755
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,200
Understand?

756
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,320
This is also

757
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,040
your Tashan, right?

758
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,640
What do you mean?

759
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,160
After the exercise,

760
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,360
you should be promoted, right?

761
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,160
Do you think

762
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,600
I enjoy being an officer?

763
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,360
I dare not.

764
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,560
Do you remember

765
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,640
the pyramid

766
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,440
I told you about?

767
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,360
It’s been almost ten years.

768
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,280
Whether I am on or off the battlefield,

769
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,720
I am diligent and extremely cautious.

770
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,480
This is a war.

771
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,240
Alright,

772
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,880
go back and get ready.

773
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,000
Yes.

774
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:45,920
Colonel.

775
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,660
Hello.

776
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,400
Yeah.

777
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,640
I’ll be right there.

778
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:58,840
Let’s go.

779
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,880
Army Commander Zheng is here. Follow me to greet him.

780
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,400
Yes.

781
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,620
[Raise vigilance]

782
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,420
[Be strict with requirements]

783
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,080
Stand up.

784
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,320
Chief.

785
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,480
The acting Commander of the Third Battalion, Xia Lin,

786
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,760
was a scout.

787
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,360
It is indeed a good choice

788
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,630
to let him take charge of shooting.

789
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,630
Don’t try to fool me with a few top soldiers,

790
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:37,760
give me the roster.

791
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,800
Commander of the Third Battalion.

792
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:40,960
Yes.

793
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,190
The roster.

794
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,320
Yes.

795
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,840
Move closer

796
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:49,800
to the number one shooter.

797
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,000
Chief.

798
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,440
At the double-quick march!

799
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,150
Left, right, left.

800
00:34:55,400 --> 00:35:01,040
One, two, three, four.

801
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,040
Halt.

802
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,560
Left face.

803
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,480
Dress right.

804
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,940
[Roster]

805
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,240
Eyes front.

806
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,360
Zhang Bing.

807
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,520
Yes.

808
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:17,880
Wang Jian.

809
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,440
Yes.

810
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:22,940
[Roster]

811
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,520
Chief.

812
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,080
Wang Xiaolei.

813
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,640
Wang Xiaolei.

814
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,160
Report, Chief!

815
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,040
Wang Xiaolei visited his family.

816
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,840
No way.

817
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,400
I saw him just now.

818
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,680
Wasn’t he fishing by the river?

819
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:41,840
Commander of the Third Battalion.

820
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,480
Yes.

821
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,040
What’s wrong with you?

822
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,200
Get him here.

823
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,080
Yes.

824
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,200
Chief,

825
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,000
look at that.

826
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,120
How much does it weigh?

827
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,720
Four hundred and thirty-eight jin.

828
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,600
So big!

829
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,160
It is more than twice as big as

830
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,160
the wild boar caught that year.

831
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,400
That's for sure.

832
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,720
Let me put it to you this way.

833
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,680
At present, it is the heaviest pig

834
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,520
in the Army A

835
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,400
and the champion.

836
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,440
In the future,

837
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,080
I will try to make it break the military district record.

838
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,440
Colonel,

839
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,080
Chief wants to see our ammunition depot.

840
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,000
Don’t make up ideas for Chief.

841
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,440
That's what I mean.

842
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,320
Let’s go see your ammunition depot.

843
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:28,800
Yes.

844
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,000
Do you save so many grenades

845
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,440
for the pigsty?

846
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:37,840
Chief,

847
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,040
the Ninth Company is typical.

848
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:40,920
All kinds of work are

849
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,720
heavier than ordinary companies’.

850
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,360
For live grenade throwing,

851
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,000
the training implementation is more complicated.

852
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,360
Gao Liang has just arrived

853
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,880
and hasn’t had time to organize.

854
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,400
It is reasonable to assume that

855
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,560
live ammunition training is a must.

856
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,760
Practicing for war, right?

857
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,400
Yeah, right.

858
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,080
But now,

859
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,080
we are preparing for the Red Arrow exercise

860
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,720
and there is no time or energy

861
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,920
for live ammunition training.

862
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:02,920
What’s your opinion?

863
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,120
Report to Chief.

864
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,560
It’s because of the exercise that

865
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,280
we should do more

866
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,360
live ammunition trainings before it.

867
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,280
So

868
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,800
we don’t get into trouble

869
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,320
during the exercise.

870
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,080
Well.

871
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,040
Look at him.

872
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,200
After spending a few years with Chief,

873
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,560
you don’t even know to think twice before speaking.

874
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,400
Don’t get involved in the affairs of the leaders.

875
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,640
I follow the instructions of Chief.

876
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,400
As long as Chief gives instructions,

877
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,680
I will return to the company,

878
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,000
end their training,

879
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:31,840
and change into regular uniforms.

880
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,560
We would memorize the training syllabus every day,

881
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,920
get our strength up,

882
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,840
and wait at home for Army Chief to review.

883
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,160
You reported for duty on your first day today.

884
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,520
Why

885
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,840
mess with your superiors?

886
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:52,520
Chief,

887
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,480
I don’t want to get myself into trouble

888
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,960
or suffer.

889
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,080
I want to please everyone.

890
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,360
But

891
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,960
this is a field force.

892
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,600
As a field force,

893
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,480
if you cheat in training,

894
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,520
one day,

895
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,000
if the gun goes off,

896
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,840
if I lead such a troop to the battlefield,

897
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,800
I will end up sacrificing all the Ninth Company.

898
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,760
I’ll suffer as a Company Commander.

899
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:16,840
Have a seat.

900
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:17,840
Yes.

901
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,960
I found a problem.

902
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,600
There are many people in the army,

903
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,080
all infected with a disease.

904
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,760
That’s the peace disease.

905
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,080
Anyway, there is no war,

906
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,560
so, there is no sense of crisis.

907
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,080
Just keep the surface shiny all day.

908
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,960
Their eyes are only on their superiors,

909
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,800
not on the enemies on the battlefield.

910
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,200
No fault is merit.

911
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,480
Such a force

912
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:41,880
is a cause for concern.

913
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,680
Are you also infected with this disease?

914
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,680
I’m not.

915
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,560
I have antibodies.

916
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,200
In the smoke of countless wars,

917
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,800
veterans who have experienced hundreds of battles are not immune.

918
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,280
What makes you say that?

919
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,360
An epidemic spreads through a population

920
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,800
without any symptoms.

921
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,120
A portion of the population is infected,

922
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,440
but does not feel it.

923
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:05,920
But

924
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,640
the immunity of the organism gets worse and worse,

925
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,360
such as Song Jianshe.

926
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,960
For others,

927
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,160
having antibodies

928
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,720
can lead to allergies,

929
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:16,720
aches and pains,

930
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,360
fevers, and other symptoms,

931
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,680
such as you.

932
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,160
But the former thinks

933
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,280
the latter is sick.

934
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,720
Well, we’ll see what will happen on the battlefield.

935
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,080
What if the war never breaks out?

936
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,200
Then we have examinations

937
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,000
and exercises.

938
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,360
Song Jianshe had taken great effort to transfer you back.

939
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,960
First, you are famous for

940
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,600
your achievements in military skills,

941
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,080
so, the Ninth Company can add extra points

942
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:47,880
and win glory.

943
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,160
Second,

944
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,560
he wants to save

945
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,120
the face of the advanced Ninth Company.

946
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,920
He treats you well.

947
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,440
And this is how you repay him?

948
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,600
Chief,

949
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,240
do you think

950
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,240
I went too far?

951
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,080
That’s your business.

952
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:04,960
I don’t care.

953
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,400
But I’ll make you a request.

954
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,560
Training

955
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,840
is not for watching

956
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,360
but for fighting.

957
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,040
With the current training state of the Ninth Company,

958
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,520
we can’t expect

959
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,680
such a troop to fight on the battlefield.

960
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,000
That would be the price of a crushing defeat.

961
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,680
Chief, please rest assured.

962
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,000
In my case,

963
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,240
there is only one standard.

964
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,760
How to fight the war,

965
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,960
then how to train the soldiers.

966
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,160
Absolutely no falsification.

967
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,280
Be mentally prepared.

968
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,040
Our troops

969
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,160
need to learn to

970
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,760
fight wars far from the battlefield,

971
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,160
at times and places far from the battlefield for a while.

972
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,160
This war

973
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,400
is more arduous than the real war.

974
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:46,880
Got it.

975
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,760
Okay, you can go.

976
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:49,680
Yes.

977
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,520
Chief,

978
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,840
give me a message.

979
00:40:59,080 --> 00:40:59,760
Nanzheng

980
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,880
really has a boyfriend?

981
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,800
Who told you that?

982
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,320
Since the incident of Gu Yiye

983
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,280
a few years ago,

984
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,680
she has never revealed any information to me.

985
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,120
You’re a terrible father.

986
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,440
Intelligence work is completely paralyzed.

987
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:15,960
Chief,

988
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,200
your peace disease is serious.

989
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,840
How dare you talk about me?

990
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,840
You’ve been spending so much time with her,

991
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,040
and you’re asking me about this.

992
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,480
Shame on you.

993
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,120
You are a good leader of soldiers,

994
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,680
how come you are so stupid in this thing?

995
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,080
You are so passive and beaten,

996
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,840
don’t look for death when the time comes.

997
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:32,960
Also,

998
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,120
have you ever seen a father

999
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,160
who is willing to send his daughter

1000
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,080
to other men?

1001
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,880
You can’t even figure out this kind of thing.

1002
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,480
Get out of here. I’m going to sleep.

1003
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,560
Yes.

1004
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:57,620
[Red Arrow Exercise, Station of Regiment 700]

1005
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,200
Left, right, left.

1006
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,960
Come on, hurry up!

1007
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,120
Colonel Qin.

1008
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,840
You’ve come back after a lot of effort.

1009
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,680
It’s acting Colonel.

1010
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,520
Don’t talk nonsense.

1011
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,320
Fried Pancake,

1012
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,720
aren’t you a tutor at the Infantry College?

1013
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,040
The Academy is not as enjoyable as the community-level.

1014
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,520
A bottle of Guilin Sanhua Liquor,

1015
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,040
then the old Division Commander gave me the green light.

1016
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,680
You are so corrupt.

1017
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,000
It’s a good deal for the Regiment 700.

1018
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,800
With you Fried Pancake,

1019
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,560
I have a good dish.

1020
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,560
What a narrow-minded idea.

1021
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,600
You also have a Senior Staff Officer.

1022
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,000
Old Company Commander.

1023
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:48,920
Welcome.

1024
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:50,800
Yiye,

1025
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,400
is it the first time for me,

1026
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,440
- The former Company Commander of the Night Tiger Company,
- Left, right, left.

1027
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,120
and you, the current Company Commander of the Night Tiger Company,

1028
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,400
to shake hands?

1029
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,800
To be precise,

1030
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,360
it’s the 28th

1031
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,840
and 32nd Company Commanders

1032
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,640
who shook hands for the first time.

1033
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,440
You count clearly enough.
