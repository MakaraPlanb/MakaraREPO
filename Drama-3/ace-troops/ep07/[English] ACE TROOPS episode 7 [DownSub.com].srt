00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,260
♫ Harder than iron ♫

189
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,940
♫ Stronger than steel ♫

190
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,820
You brats!

191
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,860
When did you come in?

192
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,540
I didn't hear anything!

193
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,580
What are you doing?

194
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,020
You just need water for washing your feet.

195
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,060
Why is there a squad?

196
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,540
Zhao Hongliu.

197
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,340
Yes.

198
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,420
Take them back.

199
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,100
There will be a drill tomorrow.

200
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:31,980
Buddies!

201
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,700
Go!

202
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,700
What are you doing? What are you doing?

203
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:38,700
Come on.

204
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,500
What are you doing?

205
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,260
Sit down.

206
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,460
What are you doing?

207
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,220
No, no!

208
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,340
Relax. Relax.

209
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,300
Relax.

210
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:44,940
What are you doing? What are you doing?

211
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,680
Company commander!

212
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,600
Hang in there!

213
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,140
Attention!

214
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,620
What are you doing?

215
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,300
Did you make trouble for me?

216
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,340
I knew it.

217
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,100
You won't reset
until the new recruit company is disbanded!

218
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,810
I have to worry about you every day!

219
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,380
Tell me.

220
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,620
What did you do?

221
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,580
Password.

222
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,660
Battle. Over.

223
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,660
Sharp sword.

224
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,380
Chief,

225
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,920
we're making a night patrol.

226
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,940
Lower your voice.

227
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,540
Well,

228
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,380
make more patrols near the short wall

229
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,860
to the east of the family housing facility.

230
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,220
Did you hear me?

231
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:50,940
Yes!

232
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,300
[Iron Great Wall, Iron Soldiers]

233
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,340
We only have one hen!

234
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,660
Find it as soon as possible!

235
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,700
Otherwise, you're not allowed to go home!

236
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,060
Company commander.

237
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,100
There's a cup of wine and a cup of water.

238
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,740
Brat,

239
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:18,820
what are you doing?

240
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,460
We've been trained for three months.

241
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,620
We did make you upset.

242
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,940
Just like what you said.

243
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,980
You had to worry about us every day.

244
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,580
Our company will be disbanded tomorrow.

245
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,380
We want to

246
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,220
apologize to you now

247
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,500
since there will be no chance in the future.

248
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,340
Right?

249
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,420
Well,

250
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,500
I'll go first.

251
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:47,860
Company commander.

252
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,820
During the first week of our training,

253
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,060
I destroyed

254
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:52,940
your bed.

255
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,860
[The cannon is always ready!]

256
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,740
When we went back after the field training,

257
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,700
I sewed

258
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,140
the bottom of your pants.

259
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,060
I tried to stop him

260
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,020
but it's a pity that I failed.

261
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,620
I was punished
because I ate steamed buns and had a fight.

262
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,980
Someone added pepper spray

263
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,780
to your toothpaste.

264
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:13,740
Yeah, it's me.

265
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,300
I did those things

266
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,020
with them.

267
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,700
Anyway, company commander,

268
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,460
although those things happened,

269
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,260
you didn't give up on us.

270
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,580
You didn't even want to quit

271
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,820
torturing us.

272
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,780
You still received training
and do wrestling with us.

273
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,260
Our pants and shoes were torn.

274
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,060
Our skin was renewed again and again.

275
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,620
We had never been through this.

276
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,500
But company commander,

277
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,860
we really hated you.

278
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,380
We hated you so much.

279
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,340
We wanted to kill you every day.

280
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,700
I know.

281
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,540
Company commander,

282
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,220
whenever you folded your hands
behind your back

283
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,180
and scolded us,

284
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,580
you were so arrogant.

285
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,860
Whenever you stood in front of the queue
with arms akimbo,

286
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,260
you didn't have to say anything.

287
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,820
Your stare

288
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,940
could turn us into

289
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,020
bullets that had already been loaded.

290
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,700
It's weird.

291
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,740
Whenever you coughed,

292
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,620
we were

293
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,100
weirdly shocked.

294
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,100
We hate you

295
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,340
but we also like you.

296
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,180
After all,

297
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,140
you're our soul.

298
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,340
During the three months,

299
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,300
what we wanted to hear the most

300
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,620
is your

301
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,780
"disband".

302
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,980
Brats!

303
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,860
Well, company commander,

304
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,740
there's another thing.

305
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,420
I'm responsible

306
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,900
for that.

307
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,340
No.

308
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,420
He beat me to it.

309
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:02,980
Otherwise, I would also...

310
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,900
Enough.

311
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,900
Stop it.

312
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,460
I've already been punished.

313
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,540
Let's stop it. Sit down.

314
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,340
OK. Let's stop it.

315
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,700
Company commander,

316
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,220
you'll go to Night Tiger Company tomorrow.

317
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,820
Our company will be disbanded this time.

318
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,620
We just have a question for you.

319
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,420
Are you satisfied with us?

320
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,460
Are you satisfied?

321
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:32,900
Company commander.

322
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,660
That depends on how you will

323
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,260
take revenge on me tonight.

324
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,940
We won't take revenge on you.

325
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,500
We'll repay you, company commander.
We'll repay you.

326
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,180
Company commander, well,

327
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,340
if you're satisfied with us,

328
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,380
please drink wine.

329
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,540
If you're not,

330
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,100
please drink water.

331
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,260
Stop it.

332
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,700
I don't know if there's a trap.

333
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,700
Will you drink? Just answer it.

334
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,980
Sincerity matters.

335
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,090
No, no, no!

336
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,620
The alcohol content of Shaodaozi is 62%.

337
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,780
You finished it at a time?

338
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,460
We need food besides alcohol.

339
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,980
Get something to eat!

340
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,500
Come on!

341
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,260
There's food.

342
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:17,860
Come on, cups.

343
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,060
Come on.

344
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,180

345
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,540

Company commander.

355
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:50,620
Company commander.

356
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,940
Braised chicken with dark soy sauce.

357
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,740
Great, Gao Liang!

358
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,060
I like you for this.

359
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,660
You're very active.

360
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,740
Come on, let's have a taste.

361
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,220
Gao's braised chicken with dark soy sauce.

362
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,180
Give me a piece.

363
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,200
Hurry up. Here's one...

364
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,220
Get your hands off me.

365
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,700
Company commander.

366
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:27,940
Song.

367
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:28,980
Come on.

368
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,540
Sit down. Let's sit together.

369
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,380
It's quite lively here.

370
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,580
You stay up late.

371
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,420
Chief, we...

372
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,060
We're catching up with our commander

373
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,300
before we leave the new recruit company.

374
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,340
Yep.

375
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,340
Catching up?

376
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,660
I think you're hitting the bottle.

377
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,980
Song, no kidding.

378
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,140
We're fine.

379
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,580
Well,

380
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,900
sit down and drink with us.

381
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:00,900
Listen,

382
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,180
I've investigated.

383
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,340
Chief Song

384
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,660
can hold his liquor.

385
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,900
Come on, Song.

386
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:09,620
Taste this.

387
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,100
Gao's braised chicken with dark soy sauce.

388
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,980
Pour wine for Chief Song.

389
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,620
Pour wine. Pour wine.

390
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,180
Come on.

391
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,500
What do you think?

392
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:24,860
It's good, isn't it?

393
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,220
Open your mouth.

394
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,820
It's my Erhuang's left foot.

395
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,940
Who killed it?

396
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,820
According to the investigation
of the Military Affairs Unit,

397
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,900
the Third New Recruit Company

398
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,500
violated our rules again and again,

399
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,410
which shows the training is not enough

400
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,940
for the Third New Recruit Company

401
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,780
and there's a great problem

402
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,060
about personnel management.

403
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,700
Company Commander Qin Hanyong

404
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,340
is responsible for that.

405
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,500
The Regimental Communist Party Committee

406
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,500
decided to demote Qin Hanyong
from company commander

407
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,060
to deputy company commander.

408
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,860
Pay greater attention
to the related new recruits

409
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,980
while dispatching them.

410
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,580
Roll call for the Third Company.

411
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,340
Wang Dong.

412
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,260

Wang Dake.

432
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:21,580
Yes.

440
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,540
Shu is going to raise pigs.

441
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,540
Raise pigs?

442
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,900
It's good. Awesome!

443
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,180
Ma Yuanbo.

444
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:39,900
Yes.

445
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,620
We

446
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,860
- are qualified to raise pigs,
- The target

447
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,540
- aren't we?
- is the second car.

448
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,700
Turn right.

449
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,580
Run.

450
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,220
The remaining people

451
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,860
will join the Ninth Company
of your Regiment 720.

452
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,540
Yes!

453

Look forward.

456

All of you

457
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,460
follow the commissar to
the Ninth Company of Regiment 720.

458
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,380
Sergeant,

459
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,500
what do you think of the Ninth Company?

460
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,100
The Ninth Company of Regiment 720

461
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,780
is the worst company of the whole regiment.

462
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,540
Worrying about things that might never happen
increases their chances of happening.

463
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,260
The worst is yet to come.

464
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,820
Everyone,

465
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,340
turn right.

466
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,780
Run! One, two, one.

467
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,020
One, two, one.

468
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,580
Thank you for your concern.

469
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,260
I'm so envious of you.

470
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,980
I want you to teach me

471
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:51,900
how to train soldiers.

472
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:52,980
Company Commander Zhao,

473
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,660
I've already suffered a lot.

474
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,100
Stop teasing me.

475
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,460
Maybe they're not

476
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,020
traditional good soldiers,

477
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,340
but I believe

478
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,740
after they enter the battlefield,

479
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,580
they'll be able to take the bullet
for each other.

480
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,260
If you treat soldiers like babies,

481
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,340
they'll be willing
to share wear and woe with you.

482
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,100
If you treat soldiers like your kids,

483
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,580
they'll be willing to die with you.

484
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:15,820
Company Commander Zhao,

485
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,100
I don't understand complicated terms,

486
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:19,860
but I know

487
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,420
if I keep getting demoted,

488
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,740
I'll have to call you chief

489
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,060
when I see you next time.

490
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,980
If I give you a chance,

491
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,340
will you do the same thing again?

492
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,510
If you take responsibility,

493
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,660
you'll be demoted to a lower rank.

494
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:32,780
I think I will.

495
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,420
Cheer up

496
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,180
since you think it's right.

497
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,500
I have to help my soldiers

498
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,340
even if I'll be demoted.

499
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:03,820
[Sweat buckets during your daily life]

500
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:14,580
Listen.

501
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,260
From today onward,

35 new comrades

503
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,340

504

and receive training with us.

505
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,500
Some of them

506
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,100
are already familiar to us.

507
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,740
In the future,
there will be more chances and time

508
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,140
for us to study with them.

509
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,100
The post of commander of the Ninth Company

510
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,500
is vacant for the time being.

511
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,380
Next, our new deputy company commander

512
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,740
will give a speech.

513

and a gun to train with you back then,

528
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,860

00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,540
these years,

570
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,340
missing your chances every time.

571
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,060
I was thinking of

572
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,420
assigning a few physically fit

573
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,140
and advanced soldiers

574
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,180
in your squad this time,

575
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,260
right?

576
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,260
So, at the end of the year,

577
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,340
I'll honor you an excellent sergeant,

578
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,780
then you'll get

579
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,500
promoted naturally.

580
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,180
I still want Gao Liang, Gu Yiye

581
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,740
and those soldiers.

582
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,360
I want to make them into a squad.

583
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,140
After so many years in the army, I found that

584
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,900
some people

585
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,690
are born to be soldiers.

586
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,420
Gu Yiye, for example,

587
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,140
he's smart

588
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,420
and has a good understanding
of military theories.

589
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,090
No one else can compare.

590
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,260
And Gao Liang.

591
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,380
How should I put it?

592
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,300
If the army is

593
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,380
a big family,

594
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,300
soldiers like Gao Liang

595
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,460
are the master of this big family.

596
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,300
Although he's a new recruit,

597
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,820
he is very well-adapted here.

598
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,060
I... I really want to

599
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,100
be there with them

600
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,540
and to see how far they can go

601
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,380
If I can't be

602
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,300
an excellent soldier

603
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,580
myself this life,

604
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,580
the soldiers I lead surely will be.

605
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,700
Can you understand that?

606
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,580
Yes, I do.

607
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,140
I also know

608
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,900
that the soldiers you mentioned are good,

609
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,860
however,

610
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,620
I have to remind you

611
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,580
that these guys

612
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,140
are dynamite together.

613
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,360
It could easily explode.

614
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,180
You won't get what you want.

615
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,420
I want to give it a shot, Song.

616
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,460
Why be so stubborn?

617
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,220
If something goes wrong,

618
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,770
your chance of promotion

619
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,620
this year will be spoiled.

620
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,380
Your clock's ticking

621
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,820
and are about to be demobilized and go home.

622
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,900
Your years of service will be in vain.

623
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,980
Even if you're willing to do it,

624
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,220
have you thought about him?

625
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,580
This man

626
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,340
has already been demoted twice.

627
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,820
One more time,

628
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:55,980
he will be a lieutenant.

629
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,370
All right, save it.

630
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,740
Don't get me involved, Song.

631
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,100
Zhang Fei,

632
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,740
I'm not Guan Yu

633
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,500
and he's not Liu Bei.

634
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,180
Although we never took an oath of fraternity,

635
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,780
the three of us

636
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,180
were in the same new recruit company.

637
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:16,980
If you

638
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,180
really set your mind

639
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,020
on this,

640
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,220
you have my support.

641
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,620
Qin, thank you.

642
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,240
Song, I can lead them well.

643
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,880
Of course you can.

644
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,540
If you can't,

645
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,060
why have you been serving for so many years

646
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,820
without being promoted?

647
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,980
But this is no joke.

648
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,180
You have to be careful

649
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,300
and really think it over.

650
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,220
I've already decided.

651
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,140
All right.

652
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,300
Since you have the same opinion,

653
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,180
we've reached a consensus,

654
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,140
and it's settled.

655
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,660
All right.

656
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,060
Others can always count on

657
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,700
their friends and comrades

658
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,060
to get some benefits in the future.

659
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,060
But I'm afraid

660
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:12,020
[Company Office]

661
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,500
you two will be a burden on me.

662
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,580
I'm off.

663
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,780

664
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,500

00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,220
Sergeant.

666
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,820
I'm in a bad mood.

667
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,580
What's wrong?

668
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,940
Those mischievous soldiers
from the new recruit company

669
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,860
are all in the same squad.

670
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,220
And I'm leading them.

671
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,300
I don't know why this is keep happening.

672
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,420
I really can't avoid you brats.

673
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,420
To be honest,

674
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,940
I really don't like to work with you.

675
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,860
If I perform well

676
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,060
and get you promoted,

677
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,780
you'll have to come back and thank us later.

678
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,460
What you said

679
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,580
does make sense.

680
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:51,780
Well,

681
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,980
you guys hurry up.

682
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,580
Let's have

683
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,780
a meeting

684
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,620
to elect a vice sergeant.

685
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,080
You know that

686
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,260
Zhao Hongliu's weak in health.

687
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,240
The training alone is stressing him.

688
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,500
If he's the vice sergeant,

689
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,380
I think it's too much for him.

690
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,580
The deputy company commander

691
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:10,940
said that the vice sergeant

692
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,180
should be chosen from

693
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,260
among the top trainers.

694
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,140
Okay, I know what that means.

695
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,780
Don't get too cocky yet.

696
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:20,860
See,

697
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,140
the deputy company commander

698
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,140
also said that

699
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,180
appointment in the army is an art.

700
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,500
Do you know why?

701
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,260
Because every company

702
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,110
has mischievous soldiers.

703
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,060
But,

704
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,580
if they are

705
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:33,780
assigned to the right posts,

706
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,220
they will not only be able to perform well,

707
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,260
they can also train the new recruits, right?

708
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,540
As in our squad,

709
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,620
or even the company,

710
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:40,420
well,

711
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,620
you two

712
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,100
are count top of making trouble.

713
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,620
So, the vice sergeant

714
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,460
will be chosen between the two of you.

715
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,460
Sergeant,

716
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,220
is this an honor or a disgrace?

717
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,060
It sounds weird to me.

718
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,260
Of course it's an honor.

719
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,620
So it's me, right?

720
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,460
What's the point of electing?

721
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,580
How about this?

722
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,760
If I win,

723
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,340
you run 50 laps in the playground,

724
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,420
and I'll count for you.

725
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,580
Thank you.

726
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,580
20 kilometers is nothing.

727
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,820

734
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,980
I don't want that to happen to me, okay?

of getting promoted this year.

00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:18,100
One! Two! Three! Four!

759
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,940
One! Two! Three! Four!

760
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,500
Commander.

761
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,780
Sorry. Deputy Commander.

762
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,300
The new recruits are doing well,

763
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,300
training themselves

764
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,580
before the whistle.

765
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,580
I think

766
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,460
they know what they're doing.

767
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,060
You came to the 9th company
because of a punishment.

768
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,460
How can they not work hard?

769
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,820
Why are they all recruits?

770
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,620
Where are the veterans?

771
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,740
Still sleeping.

772
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,980
♫ Unity is strength ♫

773
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:10,500
♫ This power is iron ♫

774
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,220
♫ This force is steel ♫

775
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,820
♫ Harder than iron ♫

776
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:17,220
♫ Stronger than steel ♫

777
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:20,540
♫ Fire upon Fascism ♫

778
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,900
♫ Let all... ♫

779
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:46,980
Are you insulting us?

780
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,420
You little bastard, how dare you?

781
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,540
Are you insulting us?

782
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,300
Boys, they're insulting us.

783
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,940
Hold them firm.

784
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,340
It's okay. Brush your teeth.

785
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:13,620
You rookie,

786
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,739
do you know what
feel suddenly refreshed means?

787
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,820
What are you looking at?

788
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,860
You rookie!

789
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:24,100
How dare you!

790
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,179
- Stop it.
- Stop fighting.

791
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:28,820
Sergeant is coming.

792
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,020
What are you doing?

793
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:37,580
Mess with us as you outnumber us?

794
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,179
188.

795
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:44,620
189.

796
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,980
Are you two girls?

797
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:51,620
Pushup's not your thing, huh?

798
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:52,739
Faster!

799
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,580
If Jiang Nanzheng

800
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,500
heard that,

801
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,380
she would snap at him

802
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,780
for looking down on woman soldier.

803
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,300
What's so funny?

804
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,020
I think you look down on them, too.

805
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,100
So you're the same kind.

806
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,460
What about you?

807
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,900
You know them well?

808
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,420
I'll kick your ass.

809
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,380
Look at you two.

810
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,260
Still have the energy to make chit-chat?

811
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,900
Seems it's not enough for you.

812
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,180
No, it's all right, Sergeant.

813
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,060
Really?

814
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,140
100 more each!

815
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,500
Keep an eye on each other.

816
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,180
After you finish, 5 km on the playground!

817
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,900
Move faster!

818
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,860
You're really something.

819
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,500
Fought with the new recruits

820
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,980
and lost?

821
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,060
They're just not on my level.

822
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,940
You have a good sense of the big picture.

823
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,300
If you guys are really good,

824
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,820
surpass them in training.

825
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,060
Run faster than them,

826
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,540
shoot better than them,

827
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,900
beat them in tactics, and smarter than them.

828
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,540
If you can do that,

829
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,820
then you can say to them,

830
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,460
"You're not on my level."

831
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,260
Understand?

832
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,940
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

833
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,500
Really?

834
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,620
Yes, sir.

835
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,580
Bullshit!

836
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:22,180
The new recruits are easily provoked.

837
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,740
And the veterans?

838
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,860
Even mortars can't blast them.

839
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,540
I'll tell you what.

840
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,220
All I can do now

841
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,780
is to make the new recruits
stomp on you hard.

842
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,780
They'll stomp on your faces
with the soles of their shoes,

843
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,260
reminding you all the time

844
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,220
to take the veterans of the 9th company

845
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,820
and work together to beat them.

846
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,500
Yes, sir!

847
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,420
We're about to have shooting training.

848
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,820
If the new recruits

849
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,340
who just got their hands
on a gun win you over,

850
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,060
that'll be fun.

851
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,020
Don't worry, sir!

852
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,300
It won't happen!

853
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,700
In your position!

854
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,260
Start shooting.

855
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,140
This is

856
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,060
a Dragunov sniper rifle.

857
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,780
The tactical use of this firearm

858
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,700
is on killing

859
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,060
living targets at about 600 meters away

860
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:27,220
[Honor Roll, First Class Achievement,
Third Class Achievement]

861
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,180
and the destruction of military equipment.

862
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,540
Ordered by the division,

863
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,740
my 1st company

864
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,100
was given the mission of testing guns

865
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,220
and selecting shooters

866
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,220
among the new recruits
who had no shooting experience.

867
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,460
They'll serve as a control group
for the new gun project

868
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,260
and cooperate with the veterans
of 1st company

869
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,060
to complete the gun-testing mission.

870
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,740
The index finger moves, other fingers remain.

871
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,300
Yes, sir.

872
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,620
Keep your hands steady.

873
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,580
Yes, sir.

874
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,380
Every new recruit

875
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,620
has the opportunity

876
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,580
to participate the gun-testing.

877
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,910
But there is a prerequisite.

878
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,540
You must have the best grades.

879
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,420
We have only one

880
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,540
principle of selection,

881
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,660
and that is

882
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,180
you must be the best one.

883
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,340
Do you understand?

884
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,580
Yes, sir!

885
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,660
Try to feel

886
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,940
the weight of the gun,
your center of gravity,

887
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,300
and your connection with the gun.

888
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,420
Yes, sir.

889
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,420
If you can't hold on,

890
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,660
go to the playground and run a lap,

891
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,660
and 50 push-ups when you come back.

892
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,540
Report!

893
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,220
Report!

894
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:28,820
Report!

895
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:30,940
Report!

896
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,500
Report!

897
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,820
Keep it steady.

898
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,460
Strengthen the upper body training.

899
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,660
Little comrades,

900
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,580
we will not make a move today,

901
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,340
or you'll be shocked.

902
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,980
But I'll tell you what.

903
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,100
Other items aside,

904
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,410
in terms of shooting alone,

905
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,520
9th company veterans

906
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,420
are on the same level as the 1st company's.

907
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,610
Good luck.

908
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:01,860
Sergeant Mao,

909
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,900
how many rings per person in the 1st company?

910
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,820
45 rings.

911
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,420
Your hands are shaking, right?

912
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,860
Our 9th company's 42 rings.

913
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,380
Two rings less for your new recruits.

914
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,660
40, what do you think?

915
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:13,940
Bring it on!

916
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,220
Losers get to wash the socks.

917
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,960
Gao Liang, bet with him.

918
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,410
If you lose, I'll wash the socks.

919
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,180
You're practice the moment of firing

920
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,260
to stabilize your hands when it goes off.

921
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,140
This is also taught by the veterans?

922
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:56,700
Commander,

923
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,060
I asked the company commander
of the first company

924
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:58,980
and figured it out myself.

925
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,340
But a battlefield is not a shooting range.

926
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,500
The focus is different.

927
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,660
Don't go astray.

928
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,420
Yes, sir.

929
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,260
Hey, wait.

930
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,660
Why did you bring me here?

931
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,260
Tell me what's going on.

932
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,820
I'm busy with training.

933
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,940
Don't stand on ceremony.

934
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,140
We're no strangers.

935
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,660
I invited you here today

936
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,020
because firstly, I want you

937
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,820
to feel the connotation of our 9th company,

938
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,100
and secondly,

939
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,900
I'd like you to give us some advice

940
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,140
on the construction of our company

941
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,260
as an advanced company.

942
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,780
So you admit that you are less advanced?

943
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,930
Recognize the reality.

944
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,180
This is easier to talk this way.

945
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,420
Admitting our shortcomings

946
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,220
is the starting point to growth.

947
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,260
You're so modest.

948
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,360
It can't be that simple.

949
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,860
Hey, come on.

950
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,140
But to be honest,

951
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,940
the 9th company is of great merit.

952
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,820
In the history of the Tashan Hero Regiment,

953
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,620
the 9th company was at
the forefront of the charge.

954
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:01,940
A few years ago,

955
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,380
you were the first in the whole army

956
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,460
to capture a Soviet-made PKM machine gun

957
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,980
from the front.

958
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,460
On top of it,

959
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,300
we mapped and duplicated the Type 80

960
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,180
and improved Type 67

961
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,260
and produced Type 67-2.

962
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,420
Lu, you're quite knowledgeable.

963
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,140
I've read

964
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,620
the internal documents on that battle.

965
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,340
This one.

966
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,940
It's an old friend of mine.

967
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,100
When I was at the Academy,

968
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,970
I worked on the replica.

969
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,540
Soviet-made PKM

970
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,820
is a miracle of engineering.

971
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:31,940
How about the performance?

972
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,620
The military district has tested

973
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,660
the PKM with the Type 67-1.

974
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,980
The overall performance of the PKM is better.

975
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,660
The body and the frame of the gun

976
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:41,940
is not as heavy as

977
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,900
the tripod of Type 67-1.

978
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,860
How is that possible?

979
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:46,940
Flexibility

980
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,820
The shooting technique you taught Gu Yiye

981
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,540
is all about

982
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:51,740
flexibility.

983
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,940
He's smart, good at learning,

984
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,020
and quite talented.

985
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:55,980
Don't worry.

986
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,540
I'll treat them all equally

987
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:58,700
in this gun-testing mission.

988
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,460
It doesn't matter if he's from
1st or 9th company,

989
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,860
whoever has the best grades
will be on the team.

990
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,180
But I can't just watch you

991
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,100
guide Gu Yiye,

992
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,100
I need to give Gao Liang

993
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,140
some advice.

994
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,820
The design of the flexible gun frame

995
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,400
needs to rely on the superpower.

996
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,870
Except for the Soviet Union,

997
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,500
only the United States

998
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,780
has the capability of solid basic science.

999
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,500
But their system lacks strong scheduling.

1000
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,160
So,

1001
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,010
they can't do it for the massive
mathematical calculations

1002
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:25,140
that consume a lot of resources

1003
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,060
and interdisciplinary communication

1004
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,540
It's a beautiful path,

1005
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,580
but it's not for everyone.

1006
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,740
We don't have it today,

1007
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,740
but we will in the future.

1008
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,340
Yes.

1009
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,420
We can't hold it now in our hands,

1010
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,020
but Gao Liang and Gu Yiye

1011
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:44,540
will get to hold it someday.

1012
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,540
I believe in the future,

1013
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:48,900
and I never doubt that

1014
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,380
even in the clumsiest way,

1015
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,460
millions of soldiers like Gao Liang

1016
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,060
will build a powerful army

1017
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:57,180
that terrifies the enemy.
