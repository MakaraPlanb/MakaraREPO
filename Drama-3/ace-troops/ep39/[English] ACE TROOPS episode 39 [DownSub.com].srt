00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,610
No.

385
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,290
Keep them going on.

386
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,760
The drill is not over yet.

387
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,570
They are enemies.

388
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,650
Gao Liang.

389
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,850
Stand up.

390
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,770
Gao Liang.

391
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,810
Let go of him.

392
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,450
You are comrades.

393
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,530
You should live and die together.

394
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,250
Let's get married.

395
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,930
I want to marry you.

396
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,480
The wind is strong,

397
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,250
so I can't hear that.

398
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,730
You asshole.

399
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,250
Gao Liang.

400
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,050
Good.

401
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,250
Chief.

402
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,530
Enjoy that?

403
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,340
[Integrated coordination, Blue Side Director, Chief Director]

404
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,530
好Great.

405
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:01,380
[Integrated coordination, Blue Side Director, Chief Director]

406
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:14,340
[Be alert and protect our country]

407
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,330
Secretary Wang,

408
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,810
do you find Wei Xiaopao?

409
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,050
I'm waiting for news.

410
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,330
It's been two hours.

411
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,570
Aren't you tired of standing?

412
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,730
Relax.

413
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,240
Chief.

414
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,730
I don't know when he will be back.

415
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,000
It's okay.

416
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,010
Go ahead.

417
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,170
Leave us alone.

418
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,130
Admit defeat this time, right?

419
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,170
Excuse me?

420
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,650
You'd better count how many teeth you have left.

421
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,730
I should kick all your teeth, right?

422
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,250
I mean,

423
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,850
you have got her.

424
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,010
Well.

425
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,050
Actually,

426
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,690
she got me.

427
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,810
I have to admit that.

428
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,490
Don't you congratulate me?

429
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,450
Forget it.

430
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,290
I'll bless her.

431
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,010
I bless you both.

432
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,250
Zheng.

433
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,090
Zheng.

434
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:11,930
Calm down.

435
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,930
How can I?

436
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,490
Look.

437
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,730
It's fine to punish me.

438
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,360
There's no need for punishing them two,

439
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,570
Gu Yiye and Gao Liang.

440
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,520
Wang, why did they do that?

441
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,770
Why?

442
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,810
Zheng.

443
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,650
The superiors are in a higher power than us.

444
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,850
You saw that, too.

445
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,290
The chief of headquarters

446
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,440
especially praised Special Force Team and Regiment 700

447
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,450
at the meeting.

448
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,090
They thought the drill

449
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,880
showed up

450
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,210
the brave spirit of the Special Troops.

451
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,200
They are indeed

452
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,320
the first Special Forces of

453
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,010
Sword of the South.

454
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,530
They also saw

455
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,610
the main force of

456
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,640
our Military Command's

457
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,410
fighting attitude.

458
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,730
Generally,

459
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,850
they affirmed our competence.

460
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,050
Afraid of getting hurt,

461
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,720
nd does that get men real skills?

462
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,330
I'm in charge of the drill.

463
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,760
The members of the observation group

464
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,890
were on the scene.

465
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,090
I saw

466
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,120
that kind of state

467
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,490
when they're in real fighting.

468
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,170
That is real fighting power,

469
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,530
real fighting spirit.

470
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,880
It makes me, a veteran,

471
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,190
so excited.

472
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,530
I'm educated.

473
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,120
With such troops

474
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,270
and soldiers,

475
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,730
shall we still need to worry about winning?

476
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,130
But now,

477
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,610
each of them gets a punishment.

478
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,490
How can they lead their soldiers in the future?

479
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:21,970
Whether to tell them,

480
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,450
while training in the future,

481
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,520
you don't need to make efforts

482
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,730
on the actual fighting.

483
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,800
If there is an accident,

484
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,850
you will get punishment.

485
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:29,930
Tell them this?

486
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,370
Why?

487
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,890
Man.

488
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,530
I understand.

489
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:35,850
The army

490
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:36,880
has always been

491
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,970
subordinate to its superiors.

492
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,930
We got such a result.

493
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:41,810
Do not mention you,

494
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,970
I also need a while to take it.

495
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,400
But one missing,

496
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,530
and five seriously injured,

497
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,130
which is unprecedented in the history

498
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,370
of drills in our Military Command.

499
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,450
And,

500
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,090
the missing soldier has not been found yet.

501
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,650
Aren't we working hard to find him?

502
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,210
But then again,

503
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,890
as long as there are drills

504
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,050
and training,

505
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,170
there will be accidents.

506
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,970
That's the price we have to pay.

507
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,120
Of course,

508
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,490
the fewer accidents the better.

509
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,730
However, we should not be less strict

510
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,050
for fear of accidents

511
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,810
and then loosen training.

512
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,120
In that case,

513
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,490
we will pay a huge sacrifice

514
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,690
in the future war.

515
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,690
I remember

516
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:23,880
six months ago.

517
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,770
On the first two days of the Iraq war,

518
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,810
you spent every day

519
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,850
in the training room

520
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,170
on a drip.

521
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,730
On March 20th.

522
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,090
During those days,

523
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,480
we all gathered

524
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,330
in the preparation room

525
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,330
and studied the war.

526
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,050
While the results

527
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,650
were not beyond your judgment.

528
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,490
Don't mention

529
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,610
the 2,000 precision missiles for the air attack.

530
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,610
On April 8th,

531
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,130
the US-UK coalition forces

532
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,490
began the ground war.

533
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,090
The Iraqi army

534
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,130
got badly beaten.

535
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,530
It's because the strength was too different.

536
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,210
That's just one of the reasons.

537
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,410
I am not talking about the defeated side,

538
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,930
I'll say the victor.

539
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,970
At the end of the war,

540
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,810
The US

541
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,330
officially declared

542
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,570
in this war,

543
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,440
262 Americans

544
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,410
have been killed.

545
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,530
The war between the two countries

546
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,480
ended up

547
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,290
at the cost of 262 men.

548
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,050
Do you know

549
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:23,680
how many Americans

550
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,080
actually died

551
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,970
in this war?

552
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,330
Didn't you just say that?

553
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,530
262.

554
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,010
It's 139,

555
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:33,960
and another

556
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,280
123 men

557
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,450
died in the accidents.

558
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,490
Wang,

559
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,650
when it comes to politics,

560
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,770
I can't compete with you.

561
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,970
But in my understanding,

562
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,890
the highest politics of the military

563
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,690
is that

564
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,410
when the state gives the order,

565
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,010
the military can keep pace.

566
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,430
The first battle

567
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,090
must be won.

568
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,250
What shall we take to fight now?

569
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,250
How can we win?

570
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,720
Accidents always happen

571
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,890
in war and training,

572
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,450
and there are casualties.

573
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,400
We only have to turn the training

574
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,570
into the actual fighting,

575
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:06,920
so that

576
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,409
when the war starts,

577
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,150
we don't panic,

578
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:09,760
get messy

579
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,409
and feel horrible.

580
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,760
That's what Gao Liang and Gu Yiye did.

581
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,400
At the last step,

582
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,000
they were still fighting together,

583
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,050
never giving up,

584
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,050
and showing courage,

585
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,320
will,

586
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,050
and determination.

587
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,480
Such an army

588
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,610
is invincible.

589
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,409
I've got to go out.

590
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,280
Zheng.

591
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,130
Where are you going?

592
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,929
I'm going to Army A

593
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,330
to check the missing soldier.

594
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,040
None of my soldiers

595
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,050
can be lost.

596
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:36,000
Well.

597
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,440
What are you two doing here,

598
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,199
not at the hospital?

599
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,280
Zheng.

600
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,889
I got an idea.

601
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,230
I'll go

602
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:47,840
to the commander and political commissar

603
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,570
to make a report,

604
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,190
suggest

605
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,199
making a report to the superiors.

606
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,650
Let them off punishment.

607
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,679
Ask them to go back to the hospital.

608
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:55,889
Alright.

609
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,530
I'll immediately report to chief.

610
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,250
Chief.

611
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,490
Chief,

612
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,330
Army A reports

613
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,210
they've found the missing soldier of the Special Force Team.

614
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,600
Where did they find him?

615
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,520
How is he going on?

616
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,480
Thirteenth District Sea Area.

617
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,770
He was rescued by a fishing boat.

618
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,040
And the detail of his injuries is unknown.

619
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:10,730
But he is conscious.

620
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,210
He's on his way to the military hospital.

621
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,450
Tell Dean Chen

622
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,770
to try his best to save him.

623
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,000
If there is any problem,

624
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,970
report it directly to me.

625
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:18,890
Yes sir.

626
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,770
Since the wounded have been found,

627
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:23,880
you don't have to go.

628
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,830
Have them go back to the hospital.

629
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:25,320
No.

630
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,450
I have to go and see the soldier.

631
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,720
I have to ask him

632
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,130
what he thought when he disappeared.

633
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,650
I'll get him next time.

634
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,370
Chief.

[Secretary]

636
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,200
Captain Qin, they've

637
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:34,970
been waiting in the meeting room

638
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:35,950
all morning.

639
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:36,950
Tell them to get back to me,

640
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,040
and after 70 minutes,

641
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,050
I'll listen to their report.

642
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,010
Yes, sir.

643
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,210
Thank you, chief.

644
00:35:55,140 --> 00:36:01,060

[One month later]

647
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,530
You know, you got removed this time.

648
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,290
It's probably a good thing.

649
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,250
Actually,

650
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,890
you can take advantage of this recovery period

651
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,370
to get everything done.

652
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,320
You know what I'm talking about?

653
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,410
Yeah.

654
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:23,680
Okay.

655
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,570
I got to go.

00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,530
Xia.

657
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,650
I heard

658
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,410
you've been tracking Prince?

659
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,010
You know,

660
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,930
for six years,

661
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,010
there has been no whereabouts.

662
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,650
Listen to my advice.

663
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,810
You are not young.

664
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,610
You should hurry up

665
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,050
and sort out your personal issues.

666
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,320
You are disabled now,

667
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,370
but you still care about others' business.

668
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,210
You should take care of yourself.

669
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,050
It's been six years.

670
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,050
If you keep tracking down Prince,

671
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,810
it will get in the way of you doing something else,

672
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,410
You should move forward.

673
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,610
Think about it.

674
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,450
Cut the crap.

675
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,130
I'll leave.

676
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:13,850
Just go.

677
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,730
Hello, Uncle Xia.

680
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,210
I heard

681
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,880
you got admitted to Tsinghua University

682
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,920
majoring in computer science and technology.

683
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,010
You're amazing.

684
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:25,890
How about

685
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,010
joining the army after graduation?

686
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,400
Joining the army?

687
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,850
Maybe talk about it later.

688
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,160
You little brat.

689
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:31,520
Alright.

690
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,010
Enjoy your chat.

691
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:32,880
You may leave.

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,730
Goodbye, Uncle Xia.

00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,530
Bye.

Bro Xia.

695
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,840
I told Gu,

696
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,810
I won't be a soldier.

697
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:40,600
Sit down.

698
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,210
Why are you standing there?

699
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,890
You're rude.

700
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,410
You come to the hospital

701
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,530
and don't ask me how well I'm getting.

702
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,810
You guys are really hurt?

703
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,880
I thought Gu pretended to be injured

704
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,930
to get my Mom's love.

705
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,070
Of course, we got injured.

706
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:57,920
If we hadn't been injured,

707
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,690
we wouldn't have been in hospital for so long.

708
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,250
You're right.

709
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,690
Come.

710
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,330
Come on.

711
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,010
What do you intend to do?

712
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,530
Let me see if you get well.

713
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,050
Try harder.

714
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:09,800
Come on.

715
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,250
Come on.

716
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,130
Try harder.

717
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,090
Try harder.

718
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,130
Harder!

719
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,640
You're messing around here.

720
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,810
Okay. That's enough.

721
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,570
I don't feel like you're hurt.

722
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,690
I'll tell you one last thing.

723
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,130
Keep it between us.

724
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,250
Go ahead.

725
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:30,930
I

726
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,610
applied for Tsinghua's National Defense Student.

727
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:34,930
So what?

728
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,290
Regret it?

729
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,330
Nonsense.

730
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,050
It's not afraid of Gu.

731
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,290
A few years ago,

732
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,930
there was the Confederate Embassy bombing

733
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,370
and the South China Sea collision.

734
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,810
These two times I cried,

735
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,770
but that's enough.

736
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,570
I don't want anything else to happen.

737
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,250
So I determined

738
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,690
to join the army in my own way,

739
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,090
to make a contribution to my country

740
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,610
and people.

741
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:13,850
Good.

742
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,290
Perfect.

743
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:16,930
Well done.

744
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,970
Don't tell anyone else.

745
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,530
Don't worry.

746
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,410
I heard both of you have been removed.

747
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,290
It's really exciting.

748
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,170
This is more exciting than my application to Tsinghua University.

749
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,130
Stop nonsense.

750
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,680
Little brat.

751
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,520
You know nothing.

752
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,490
Let me tell you.

753
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,010
This is called

754
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,930
cultivating future talents for our army.

755
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,770
Do you get it?

756
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,560
Well. Cultivating...

757
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,010
Cultivating talents.

758
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,690
Stop showing off.

759
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,930
Let me tell you.

760
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,250
Your dad and I

761
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,130
are going to school in Beijing, too.

762
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,130
That place is not far from Tsinghua University.

763
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,000
That's where all the generals are trained.

764
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,690
Do you know?

765
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,370
Really?

766
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,370
Let's go.

767
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,250
Get out of the hospital.

768
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,480
Come on. Let me help you.

769
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,450
Stop.

770
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,450
Go and get

771
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,720
the stuff inside the cupboard

772
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,810
and put it on the bed.

773
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,370
What's that?

774
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,170
Is it this one?

775
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,090
Put it on the bed.

776
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,050
Stop looking at it.

777
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,820
[To Jiang Nanzheng only]

778
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,620
[To Jiang Nanzheng only]

779
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,130
Nanzheng.

780
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,730
I knew

781
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,890
you would come to get me out of the hospital today.

782
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,370
And then,

783
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,810
as you wish,

784
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,410
we can get married.

785
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,730
But I want to tell you,

786
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,890
I already have someone I love.

787
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,010
It makes me suffer.

788
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,450
I don't know how to tell you.

789
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,370
I think we need to

790
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,410
have a talk.

791
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,090
I'll wait for you in the barrack of the Ninth Company in Sanling Mountain.

792
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,770
You can choose not to come,

793
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:35,540
[Ward]

794
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,170
but I will keep waiting.

795
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:41,860
[Never shed tears even for bloody sweat. Never be left behind even being peeled of the meat.]

796
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:06,820
[Learn from Comrade Lei Feng. Mao Zedong]

797
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:16,100
[Iron discipline, iron company, iron style, iron quality]

798
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:24,900
[Strengthen ideals and beliefs]

799
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:24,970
Nanzheng.

800
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,610
Yiye.

801
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,530
How come you are here?

802
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,450
Nanzheng.

803
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,650
After hearing what I say,

804
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,370
you must hold on.

805
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,330
Gao Liang, he

806
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,370
doesn't know how to face you,

807
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,450
so he asked me to tell you.

808
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,490
But I...

809
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,210
I don't know how to tell you, either.

810
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,450
Where is he?
