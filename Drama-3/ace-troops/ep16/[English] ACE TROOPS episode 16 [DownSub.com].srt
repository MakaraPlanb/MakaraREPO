5
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,920
you are my best comrade.

6
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,960
We used to climb walls,

7
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,840
hide from boars,

8
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,000
and shun the provost together.

9
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,720
But what about the future?

10
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,560
I can only see you off the stage

11
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,440

12
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,320
Gao Liang,

13
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,080
the art troupe will always follow

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,400
Whether at the sentry post at remote places,

or on the top plateau,

17
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,840
and even on the battlefield,

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I will visit you

19
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,400

20

The distance between soldiers and our actors

21
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,400
is always the closest.

22
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,440
That's not true.

23
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,240
You will be everyone's Jiang Nanzheng,

24
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,920
not my own.

25
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,040

00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,960
I want to

29
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,200
ask you for help.

Do you make up your mind?

39
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,170
Have you asked the sergeant for leave?

40
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,000
The sergeant doesn't have time for Gu.

41
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,730
All the sergeant is thinking about

42
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,490
is wearing the cadre uniform

43
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,090
and he wishes to give everyone time off.

44
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,600
You're finally here.

No way.

47
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,000
Gao was specially transferred

48
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,440
to perform the task assigned by the platoon leader.

49
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,880
So you know it.

50
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,370
Let's go.

51

Why are you more anxious than Gu?

54
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,440
Well,

55
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,640
you don't want Jiang to leave, do you?

56
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,520
Yes.

57

Why is your thought so complicated now?

No!

88

00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,200
OK.

196
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,640
Fine. I'll be done soon.

197
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,520
Hello.

198
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,560
I have thirty yuan.

199
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,320
How about thirty yuan for two dresses?

200
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:22,960
Well,

201
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,120
I can't decide.

202
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:24,840
Think about it.

203
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,120
Just two yuan short.

204
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,920
And I'll buy two dresses.

205
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,360
Here is the money.

206
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,920
Let me wrap them for you.

207
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,490
OK.

Nanzheng,

209
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,560
I'm done.

210
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,760
How much is it cheaper?

211
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,320
Two yuan.

212
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,760
Two yuan.

Look at your smile,

214
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,000
I thought you cut six yuan.

215
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,440
Let's go.

216

217
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,960
wait a moment.

218
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,680
I'm really sorry.

219
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,320
Our manager doesn't accept your price.

220
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,320
Please make up the difference,

221
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,880
or give the dresses back to me.

222

Comrade,

223
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,000
I gave you all my money.

224
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,970
Can't it cover the expense?

225
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,170
Why don't you

226
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,240
ask her for help?

227
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:09,740
No way!

228
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,160
How could I ask her for help?

232

236

May I ask

237
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,960
whom the other dress is for?

238
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,010
It's for you.

239
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,760

240
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,100
it looks good on you.

241
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,000
So I want to buy one for you.

242
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,830
Then you don't need to repay me.

243
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,160
I bought it myself.

244
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,040
I'll give you the rest of the money
when I go back.

245

249
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,000
The dress is too expensive.

250
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,120
I can't take it

251
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,480
unless you let me pay for it.

253

Today is Gu Yiye's first day as a sergeant.

291
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,360
You behave like this.

292
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,480
Do you still want to be in the Ninth Squad?

293
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,960
Yes, we do.

This is my first squad meeting

as your sergeant.

296
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,240
We all know each other very well

297
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,560
and have lived together for nearly a year,

298
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,360
so I don't put on airs.

299
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,240
Let's go straight to the point.

302
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:09,920
All of us in the Ninth Squad

00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,280
are his soldiers.

304
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,360
The Ninth Squad is like home to him.

305
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,280
His fiancée came.

306
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,080
Tell me, won't he bring her to us?

00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,600
So I think

00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,280
he will bring his beautiful fiancée

he will assume great airs.

313
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,760
The former sergeant has just been promoted
to the platoon leader.

314
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,080
Should we test him?

315
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,480
He got promoted and shouldn't forget about us.

316
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,400
Why would he forget us?

317
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000

322
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,440
he must be very busy.

323
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,600
In the evening,

324
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,080
the company will give him leave.

325
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,960
Then let's keep him with us,

326

We only test him for two days.

00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,280
His fiancée came all the way to the army.

Of course. It's just announced.

371

as an ordinary soldier.

You go to sleep.

572
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,160
I'll ask the company commander for leave.

573
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,400
I'd like to

574
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,560
accompany you to the county town tomorrow.

575
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,090
Then we can hang out

576
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,200
and stay a little longer.

577
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,280
Where are you going?

578
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,320
I'll go to the platoon.

579
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,320
My bed is there.

580
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,110
I have to sleep there.

581
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,080
The door is locked.

582
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,360
It must be done by those boys.

583
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,680
I can't get out.

584
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,680
Fei boy,

585
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,160
I don't mind your poor family.

586
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,480
I want to marry you

587
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,240
because you're a soldier.

588
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,520
You don't live a good life

589
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,960
like others,

590
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,560
but you take responsibility for others.

591
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,640
A man like you is a real man.

592
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,760
That's why I want to marry you.

593
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,560
I can see that

594
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,160
the army is busy

595
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,080
and you have made progress.

596
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,320
I'm not here to hold you back.

597
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,600
I'll leave tomorrow.

598
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,040
Xiu,

599
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,240
isn't it appropriate to go home tomorrow?

600
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:29,960
Besides,

601
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,240
our letter of introduction...

602
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,240
Take it easy.

603
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,720
I have two requests.

604
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,280
Tell me.

605
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,480
First,

606
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,000
take me to your chief tomorrow.

607
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,400
Why?

608
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,240
I want to thank them

609
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,080
for cultivating you.

610
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,640
If they agree,

611
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,600
I'd like to invite them to

612
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,280
be our marriage witnesses.

613
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,200
Second,

614
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,800
stay here tonight.

615
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,840
Don't go.

616
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,280
Take me to the station tomorrow morning.

617
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,040
I'll wait for you at home.

618
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,360
If you don't go back and marry me,

619
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,880
I'll keep waiting.

620
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,470
Xiu.

621
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,480
Hail, Platoon Leader.

622
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,960
Platoon Leader.

623
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,920
Comrades, what are you doing?

624
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,840
Platoon Leader, something happened to the Ninth Squad.

625
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,080
It's true.

626
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:53,920
If you're not busy,

627
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,960
please go and take a look.

628
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,200
Xiu,

629
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,000
I have something to deal with.

630
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,440
Good night.

631
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,920
My comrades, it's three o'clock.

632
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,520
Go to bed and stop horsing around.

633
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,160
[Create a new situation in the revolution and modernization of the army]

634
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,440
There'll be a big move.

635
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,080
Stand up.

636
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,600
Our division is ordered to

637
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,040
complete the assembly

638
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:56,960
within 12 hours,

639
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,000
carry all weapons and equipment,

640
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,920
prepare two cardinal numbers of ammunition,

641
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,360
march to Zhangmu Railway Station,

642
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,360
and go to the border.

643
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,480
In a word,

644
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,160
prepare for war.

645
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,080
That is all.

646
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,080
Everybody, go back immediately

647
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,600
and take action according to the order.

648
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,840
Yes.

649
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,400
Our division has already turned to
Level II readiness,

650
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,880
with all soldiers assembled,

651
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,960
equipment replenished

652
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,120
and relevant operation plans improved.

653
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,600
I asked the security section to investigate.

654
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,880
Those who violated confidentiality rules

655
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,480
by spreading gossip

656
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,760
were criticized and educated.

657
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,800
My opinion is to

658
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,920
freeze all transfers immediately.

659
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,870
No one is allowed to leave.

660
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,760
You can rest assured that at this moment...

661
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:43,360
Section chief.

662
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,640
I'll stand firm.

663
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,720
Report.

664
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,800
- Your lunch.
- OK.

665
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,060
Gao Liang.

666
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:50,840
Yes.

667
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,160
Go to the Communication Company

668
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,200
to see if Jiang Nanzheng leaves.

669
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,720
Chief, she has left.

670
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,440
Drive to the railway station now

671
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,480
and bring her back.

672
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,040
Zheng,

673
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,280
what do you mean?

674
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,080
I just said that we'll freeze all transfers.

675
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,960
This rule applies to both other soldiers

676
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,440
and my daughter.

677
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,720
Our purpose is to

678
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,960
stop those who want to be deserters.

679
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,120
Jiang Nanzheng doesn't have that problem.

680
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,880
And her transfer order

681
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,280
was issued 20 days ago.

682
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,720
Nothing happened at that time.

683
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,520
No matter when the order was given,

684
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,640
my daughter can

685
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,240
only move forward at this time,

686
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:25,800
but not step back.

687
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,440
Go.

688
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,280
Yes.

689
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:28,920
Attention!

690
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,360
Dress right!

691
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,160
Eyes front!

692
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,060
At ease!

693
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:37,670
Listen.

694
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,310
Tonight,

695
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,620
do your internal affairs.

696
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:47,720
Stop knocking on my door.

697
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,040
- Disband.
- Yes.

698
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,440
Platoon leader, have you met yet?

699
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,720
Get a clear picture first, right?

700
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,540
Yes.

701
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,760
Inform the cooking corps
to serve the meal in advance.

702
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,800
After lunch,

703
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,040
assemble in 20 minutes

704
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,760
and prepare to march.

705
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,360
Yes.

706
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,880
Clerk, what happened?

707
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,160
The lunch will be served early.

708
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,440
Pack up in twenty minutes

709
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,320
and go to the frontline.

710
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,520
I didn't say anything.

711
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,280
Get off! Get off!

712
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,880
Go back with me.

713
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,520
Gao Liang, stop it.

714
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,120
The train is leaving.

715
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,920
I'm in a hurry to report to the art troupe.

716
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,960
I'm not kidding.

717
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,380
The division commander asked me
to take you back.

718
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,720
What's going on?

719
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,470
Report.

720
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,680
Come in.

721
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,480
Staff Officer Sheng.

722
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,080
Yes.

723
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,640
The division headquarters is going to set off in ten minutes.

724
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,160
Tell Leng Rui to arrange a command van for me.

725
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,160
I'll set out with Regiment 700.

726
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,000
Yes.

727
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,480
Chen Dashan.

728
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:02,960
Yes.

729
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,840
This time,

730
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,240
your Regiment 700

731
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,440
responded faster than

732
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,200
the last maneuver

733
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,160
and didn't lag behind.

734
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,680
I called you here to remind you

735
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,160
that your problem has just been corrected.

736
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,160
You should maintain vigilance.

737
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,000
Do you understand?

738
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,560
Yes.

739
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,680
On the battlefield,

740
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,240
2,500 officers and soldiers of Regiment 720

741
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,280
are both soldiers

742
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,400
and lives.

743
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,200
They need to complete

744
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,000
the mission of defending national territory.

745
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,240
Their families

746
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,960
are looking forward to their safe return.

747
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,320
Do you understand the great significance?

748
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,120
Yes.

749
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,200
Go.

750
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,400
[Create a new situation in the revolution and modernization of the army]

751
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,080
Chief,

752
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,440
I have something to report.

753
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:47,960
You want to go to the subordinate unit, right?

754
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,440
Yes.

755
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,360
Get in!

756
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,440
Division Commander, I can't be a coward.

757
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,560
I ordered you to get in!

758
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,400
Yes.

759
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,400
Come on.

760
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,280
The Third Platoon, hurry up.

761
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,560
Come on.

762
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,640
Stop hanging about.

763
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,080
Come on. Hurry up.

764
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,800
Hurry up.

765
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,880
Everyone, hurry up.

766
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,240
Come on.

767
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:46,640
Hurry up.

768
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,640
Come on. Hurry up.

769
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,360
Go inside. Come on.

770
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,320
The Third Platoon, hurry up.

771
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,520
Come on. Hurry up.

772
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,440
Hurry up. Get on.

773
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:57,640
Zhang Fei.

774
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,200
Why hasn't Xiu come back?

775
00:40:59,200 --> 00:40:59,760
Hurry up.

776
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,320
Come on. Hurry up.

777
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,560
She wanted to

778
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,000
thank you and the commissar.

779
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,640
She should go shopping for gifts.

780
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,560
Zhang Fei.

781
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,840
You made me speechless!

782
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,800
At this important moment,

783
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,000
why did you ask her to buy gifts?

784
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,760
You have one hour

785
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,160
to wait for her.

786
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,000
One hour later,

787
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,040
manage to get to the railway station

788
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:18,680
and meet with the Company.

789
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,840
No, Commander.

790
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,240
I can't be separate with

791
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,160
my soldiers.

792
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,800
Execute the order. Stop talking.

[August First]

795
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,000
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

796
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,600
Wait for me.

797
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,960
Sergeant, I get on the truck.

798
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,720
Come on. Give me a hand.

799
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,680
Didn't I tell you to stay?

800
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,880
What are you doing here?

801
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,440
You all go to the frontline.

802
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,240
Why should I be left behind? I won't accept it.

803
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,800
I was approved to join you by the battalion.

804
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,760
You've been feeding pigs for months.

805
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,680
One year later,

806
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,240
you can get third-class merits.

807
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,840
What are you doing here?

[Unit 53082 of People's Liberation Army]

809
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,440
How is it going?

810
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,480
It's done boarding.

811
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:22,960
Let's go.

812
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,280
OK.

813
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,760
Let's go.

814
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,600
We ruined

815
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,160
their chance of being together

816
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,480
by clowning around.

817
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,320
It's hard to

818
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:47,950
know

819
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,120
when we're supposed to be back.

820
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,440
Stop looking.

821
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,800
Didn't you join us last night?

822
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,840
