[ACE TROOPS]

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,979
[Episode 22]

4
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,960
Admission quotas of our Company for the academy have been announced.

5
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:38,880
There’s a total of 3 quotas,

6
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:40,600
one of which

7
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,240
is in your squad.

8
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,120
The Company decided to give the quota

9
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,479
to Sergeant Han Chunyu.

10
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,000
What about Jiang Nanzheng?

11
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,640
She’ll remain and fill in your position

12
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,360
as a Sergeant.

13
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,320
Company Commander.

14
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,800
Nanzheng has witnessed the sacrifice

15
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,680
of her comrade-in-arms in this battle.

16
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,800
All she wants is to go for further study.

17
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,520
If she cannot make it this time,

18
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,720
it’ll break her heart.

19
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,000
That’s irrelevant.

20
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,920
But she’s got a Second-class Merit.

21
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,120
Xu Jialu, Sergeant of the Second Squad, also has a Second-class Merit.

22
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,600
She’s not getting the quota either.

23
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,040
That’s not fair.

24
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,440
Sergeant Han.

25
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,240
Don’t get me started on fairness.

26
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,240
There are many soldiers participated in the battle

27
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,520
and got merits.

28
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,160
They, too, are not getting the quotas.

29
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,040
What about fairness for them all?

30
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,400
But there’s a policy.

31
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,720
According to the policy of the military district,

32
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,760
anyone with a Second-class Merit

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,680
can go to the academy in principle.

34
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,160
That is the principle, but

35
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,800
it is much more complicated

36
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,760
when actually implemented on the army.

37
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,000
The leadership has taken it into consideration,

38
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,400
and made a specific explanation

39
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,480
that the quotas shall be decided

40
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,680
according to specific cases in the army.

41
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,560
Well, I have the right

42
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,080
to give up my quota

43
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,280
and give it to other comrades.

44
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,720
Han Chunyu.

45
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,080
The decision is made by company party branch.

46
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,600
You’ve been a soldier for 4 years,

47
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,920
and a model sergeant, no less.

48
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,480
This time you’ve got a Third-class Merit on the battlefield.

49
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,480
We will not treat a sergeant like you

50
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,360
badly here.

51
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,200
It’s for the righteousness of Company construction.

52
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,120
Thank you, Sergeant.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,600
But I will not take the quota.

54
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,800
If you were me,

55
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,640
and I gave my quota to you,

56
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,920
would you accept it?

57
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,520
Jiang is right.

58
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,560
You’re young.

59
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,360
You still have the chance to study for the exam.

60
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,040
This is the decision made by the collective,

61
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,520
and I hope that

62
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,000
you can understand.

63
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:54,880
Nanzheng.

64
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,760
Nanzheng, wait.

65
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,920
Sergeant.

66
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,120
I’m sorry.

67
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,080
Don’t be that way, Sergeant.

68
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,120
If anyone should be sorry,

69
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,160
it would be me.

70
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,040
Every time like this,

71
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,600
you are always the first

72
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,520
to show the dedication.

73
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,800
I always pale by comparison.

74
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,159
Sergeant.

75
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,880
Jiang Nanzheng.

76
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,640
Jiang Nanzheng.

77
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:48,960
What’s wrong?

78
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,240
You okay?

79
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,880
A bad mood, huh?

80
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,960
Don’t be sad

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,320
and be like a warrior of revolution.

82
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,480
Jiang Nanzheng.

83
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,400
Jiang Nanzheng.

84
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,720
Did someone give you a hard time?

85
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,000
Quit it.

86
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,960
I can’t go to the military academy.

87
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,600
Here, let me take that for you.

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,800
What went wrong?

89
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,840
I thought there’s a quota for you.

90
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,440
The Company called me and Sergeant for a talk.

91
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,400
They gave the quota to Sergeant Han.

92
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,320
Here, wipe your tear.

93
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,720
Then...

94
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,360
What tissue is this?

95
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,920
Are you going to

96
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,920
make more attempts?

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,280
How?

98
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,960
I’m not even allowed to speak.

99
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:35,120
Sergeant Han spoke for me

100
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,320
and tried to give her quota to me,

101
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,800
but it’s denied immediately by the Company Commander.

102
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,120
It’s okay. Uh... I’m staying here for you.

103
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,840
It’s good.

104
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,520
Okay?

105
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,840
What are you talking about, staying?

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,640
Don’t be stupid because of me.

107
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,240
I’m worried that you’ll be stupid

108
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,960
when I thought of the dumb things you did.

109
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,720
Don’t worry about me.

110
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,960
I can take care of myself.

111
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,200
Thanks, comrade.

112
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,360
Jiang Weixing?

113
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,480
How’s your wound?

114
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,680
Better.

115
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,640
Good.

116
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,160
I’m going back.

117
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,760
Niu.

118
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:17,840
Came back.

119
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,480
The Ninth squad.

120
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,560
We are all that’s left of it.

121
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,720
I know.

122
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,240
I know.

123
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,280
-I know.
-Why are you so heavy?

124
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,320
What are you doing? He just got discharged from hospital!

125
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,880
He’s not injured in the waist.

126
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:53,840
It’s okay.

127
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,320
It’s just a shot here.

128
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,880
Not a big deal for me.

129
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,520
Discharged already?

130
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,640
Are you fully recovered?

131
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,480
What did you say?

132
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I’m already here!

133
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,280
I just can’t stand another minute in the hospital.

134
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,560
They don’t let me go,

135
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,920
and I broke out.

136
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,200
And you,

137
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,960
you didn’t visit me in the hospital.

138
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,400
It kind of hurt my feelings.

139
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,880
I’m not in your Company.

140
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,080
Why would I visit you?

141
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,240
And... did you really pay attention?

142
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,000
She had visited you many times.

143
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,760
Just shedding tear outside the window

144
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,280
she didn’t go in

145
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,480
so that you can rest.

146
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,680
Be clear about that.

147
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,920
So you did visit me.

148
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,080
When?

149
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,000
Why didn’t I know?

150
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,640
Don’t believe him.

151
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,760
I was in the hospital but I,

152
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,280
I didn’t visit you.

153
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,360
Don’t lie.

154
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,600
That’s bad.

155
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,560
Go about your business.

156
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,680
I’ll have a talk with him.

157
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,320
Talk to you later.

158
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,280
Go.

159
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,960
What’s the situation?

160
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,840
There are only 3 quotas in the Company.

161
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,520
Gao Liang didn’t get it either.

162
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,920
That’s the situation.

163
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:11,840
Then

164
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,720
do we still

165
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,600
have a chance?

166
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,760
Political Commissar.

167
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,440
I thought you won’t be back till tomorrow.

168
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,000
There’s just too much to mind in my family

169
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,320
to have meetings.

170
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,080
I did a little twist

171
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,600
and bothered to reduce the schedule.

172
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:38,640
The Army Commander and the Political Commissar took the advice

173
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:40,960
and reduced the meeting schedule

174
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,200
from two days and a half to one day.

175
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,840
I’m not going to the dinner tonight.

176
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,320
You’re not?

177
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,880
I’m going to the military to take the place for you.

178
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,960
I told you not to criticize.

179
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,160
Now you’ve put the Vice Army Commander

180
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,520
in a really awkward place.

181
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,680
Words do spread fast.

182
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,400
Don’t blame me.

183
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,400
The army has experienced battle.

184
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,480
We shall train the army

185
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,920
according to the battle.

186
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,720
Isn’t it obvious?

187
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,760
They’re still following the old pattern,

188
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,440
and I just have to criticize.

189
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:12,960
Let’s talk about this

190
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,480
later in the night.

191
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:15,880
I need to give you a heads-up

192
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,040
for a certain matter.

193
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,360
Just be prepared.

194
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,440
What is it?

195
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,800
Gao just told me that

196
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,400
Nanzheng didn’t get the quota for the academy.

197
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,440
Is she not qualified?

198
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,000
She is, and there was a quota for her.

199
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,240
But the quota

200
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,040
is given to a Sergeant who has been a soldier for four years.

201
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,400
She’s also an asset.

202
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,320
Did she give the quota away?

203
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,600
Why are you looking at me?

204
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,120
This is not like you.

205
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,720
Did I say something?

206
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,400
I didn’t criticize you.

207
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,360
I’m just giving you a heads-up.

208
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,760
Nanzheng

209
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,680
is not the only one suffered from this.

210
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,960
The leadership wants balance.

211
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,680
They want to cover everything,

212
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,760
and to change the policy.

213
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,160
There’s over a hundred persons

214
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,240
who were cut off

215
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,400
just in our division alone.

216
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,000
I talked to Gao that

217
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,800
we should honor the spirit of the leadership,

218
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,280
and the Political Department must do the ideological work

219
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,360
of the comrades whose quotas were cut off.

220
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,920
They’ve contributed to the people

221
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,200
and bled for the country.

222
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,480
Do not let things like this

223
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,440
shake their faith.

224
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,800
You, as the Division Commander, must hold it first.

225
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,560
What do you mean?

226
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,280
When did I fail to hold it?

227
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,440
You may have held it in the past.

228
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,440
But this time is different.

229
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,240
I know that

230
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,960
you’ll worry about Nanzheng.

231
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,720
It’s why

232
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,240
I gave you this heads-up.

233
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,080
I’m not getting involved.

234
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,320
Do you think I want to deny my responsibility?

235
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,240
It’s different this time.

236
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,720
You and the kid had not known each other for 18 years.

237
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,840
It is your responsibility.

238
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:43,840
You can

239
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,520
take this opportunity

240
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,320
to get to know

241
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,880
each other a little more.

242
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,840
I don’t want to get involved.

243
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,120
Stop.

244
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,800
It makes sense.

245
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,560
As a father,

246
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,440
it’s okay either to step in or not.

247
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,440
I,

248
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,480
as a Political Commissar,

249
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,960
can publicly state that

250
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,040
I’m not getting involved,

251
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,400
but some of the cadres will.

252
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,680
It’s normal.

253
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,760
What you just said,

254
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,280
“I don’t WANT to get involved.”

255
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,640
Are you worried that it will hinder you?

256
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,840
Don’t want to take care of your own daughter?

257
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,680
And you stressed the word WANT instead of INVOLVE.

258
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,240
Do you understand now

259
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,000
that why you got divorced?

260
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,280
Stop using that against me.

261
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,880
You’ll do the ideological work of Nanzheng for me.

262
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,080

263
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,880
Okay, I understand.

264
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,160
Oh, by the way,

265
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,600
Where’s the admission person?

266
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,920
Yeah, the admission office, yeah.

267
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,560

She took the subsidies by the Company,

272
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,560
but would not accept those

Platoon Leader never said anything about it.

00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,160
the military must find worthy opponents,

379
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,080
not just scratching itself.

380
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,480
And second,

381
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,440
master the war if you want peace.

382
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,760
Without an ace in the hand,

383
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,680
someone will come and get you.

384
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,000
It’s a glorious fight,

385
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,800
but many problems were revealed.

386
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,200
Yeah.

387
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,960
Our army has fallen behind

388
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,880
on concepts, systems,

389
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,920
and operational ideas.

390
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,400
The idea of training soldiers and officers in peace

391
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,520
is toxic.

392
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,520
There must be an ace for the military.

393
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,520
It’s not about how many military forces a country has.

394
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,640
It’s about how many ace troops it has.

395
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,080
It’s the No.1 principle.

396
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,069
Zheng.

397
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,680
That’s a nice concept of aces.

398
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,480
Simple as the one word,

399
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,680
and you’ve got the standard.

400
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,000
It agreed with the strategic idea of

401
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,680
elite force of the military leadership.

402
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,920
There’s about to be

403
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,760
a new slimming on the military.

404
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,280
It is a forceful one.

405
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,400
Military is the field with the most intense confrontation,

406
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,200
and the most intense competition.

407
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,480
I got some data from the headquarter,

408
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,040
and the top military power

409
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,640
of the world

410
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,120
has long started the technological construction

411
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,440
and military revolution of their armies.

412
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,320
We can’t fall behind.

413
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,920
I understand your concern.

414
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,320
This reform

415
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,480
is more forceful than ever.

416
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,960
Slimming the military

417
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,680
while developing technological content

418
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,800
and efficiency.

419
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,080
We must prepare

420
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,120
for the reform.

421
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,160
Look at me,

422
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,000
almost forgetting the important issue.

423
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,560
The policy is drastically changed,

424
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,800
and the military academy is having enrollment plan

425
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,000
in addition to the recommendation.

426
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,400
Is this true?

427
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,360
Is it still in time

428
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,080
to sign up now?

429
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,600
The deadline is 3 days later.

430
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,880
Okay, I see.

431
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,520
Sir.

432
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,400
Come in.

433
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,560
Chief.

434
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,160
Why are you here?

435
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,240
It’s been a while,

436
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,240
and I think I’ll pay a visit.

437
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,120
A visit?

438
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,680
You little brat, did you grow complacent

439
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,040
for having a First-class Merit?

440
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,360
There’re reports from agencies

441
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,280
that

442
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,600
some comrades who

443
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,360
have distinguished performance on the battlefield

444
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,520
are lowering their self-standard

445
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,280
after the battle,

446
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,440
slacking and stuff.

447
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,800
The division is trying to get examples,

448
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,360
and would you be that unlucky one?

449
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,440
Chief.

450
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,400
I’m not that kind of guy.

451
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,960
After I retreated from the front line,

452
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,160
I’ll remind myself

453
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,040
in daily training

454
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,920
that I’m training for the sacrificed comrades-in-arms.

455
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,880
When I’m on a duty,

456
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:55,640
I’ll remind myself

457
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,360
that I’m on duty for the sacrificed comrades-in-arms.

458
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,160
Then how come you have time

459
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,480
to visit me?

460
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:02,920
Chief.

461
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:04,920
I’m here today

462
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,880
to complain for Jiang Nanzheng.

463
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,320
Complain?

464
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,640
For Nanzheng?

465
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,440
Yes.

466
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,200
Division Commander.

467
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,080
I’ve served you for a long time,

468
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,840
and I know you are a righteous person.

469
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,600
The wine smashing,

470
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,320
it was like smashed on my head,

471
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,680
and I’ll never forget it in my life.

472
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,760
But there’re things

473
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,000
like

474
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,840
Nanzheng going to the military academy.

475
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,560
It’s really important to her,

476
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,160
and I hope you can help her out.

477
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,200
Help her out? How?

478
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,480
Then

479
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,360
what about other kids?

480
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,960
What about those who are

481
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,200
not capable of helping out their children?

482
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,840
I heard that

483
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,720
your quota got cut off too.

484
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,720
Would you need my help too?

485
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,520
No, Chief.

486
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,040
If I can’t go to the military academy, I’ll stay in the military.

487
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,160
I’ll do my best in training.

488
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,320
I’ll show you that

489
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,800
you can get good soldiers without going to the academy.

490
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,880
But it’s different for Nanzheng.

491
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,720
Nanzheng not going to the military

492
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,280
is a matter of two people.

493
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,720
Two people?

494
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,560
Which two people?

495
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,800
No, a matter of one person.

496
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,000
Don’t play that with me,

497
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,920
I am familiar with you.

498
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,480
Tell me the truth.

499
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,440
Sir, there’s really nothing to tell.

500
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,200
When you were at the division headquarters,

501
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,360
you went to the Communication Company as soon as you got some time,

502
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,560
and always talked to me

503
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,640
about this and that about Nanzheng.

504
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,360
What’s really happening between you two?

505
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,320
Are you in a secret relationship?

506
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,560
How’s that possible?

507
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:32,920
Zheng?

508
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,400
Dad,

509
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,160
I am in a relationship,

510
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,480
but it’s not with him.

511
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,040
Then who is him?

512
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,120
I can’t tell you that.

513
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,200
Or else with your warlord-like parent conduct,

514
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,400
his future will definitely be ruined.

515
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,280
Is he a soldier?

516
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,600
How dare you!

517
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,320
Do you know

518
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,760
that soldiers can’t be in relationships.

519
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,400
Chief…

520
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:01,880
You step out

521
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,800
of this.

522
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,600
Chief,

523
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,840
she’s a girl and too shy to say it,

524
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,280
so I’ll do it for her.

525
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,000
She, she is in a relationship,

526
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,440
but she hasn’t even held that man’s hand,

527
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,320
not to mention effecting work.

528
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,800
The military discipline does ask us

529
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,480
not to be involved in relationships,

530
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,000
but it didn’t ask us

531
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,360
not to like someone, right?

532
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,880
Gao Liang, Gao Liang,

533
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,520
what should I do with you?

534
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,760
You little jerk.

535
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,520
You said all these, and you know

536
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,080
that I, as the Division Commander, can’t say anything,

537
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,000
but I’m her father,

538
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,880
and I really want to shoot you!

539
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,880
Zheng!

540
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,120
Dad,

541
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,080
you were right at not asking for favors

542
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,640
to try to get me the test opportunity.

543
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,520
I would be disappointed

544
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,880
if you actually did.

545
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,480
I hope you can always be this tough.

546
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:02,960
This

547
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,720
is the dad my mom hated

548
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,520
yet couldn’t let go for decades.

549
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,040
But dad,

550
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,480
Gao Liang is the role model of the whole army,

551
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,320
and if this kind of soldier’s opportunity

552
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,200
of pursuing education is taken away,

553
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,480
then does it mean Division 234’s standard

554
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,320
of nurturing talents has some problems?

555
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,800
I, as a soldier,

556
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,280
hope the Chief’s Office

557
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,680
can consider this with great care.

558
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,240
This is our community-level soldiers’ aspiration,

559
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,160
and the reason for me coming here for you today.

560
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,320
By the way,

561
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,280
I, as your daughter, really hope my relationship

562
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,600
can be understood by my father,

563
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,560
and have your blessings.

564
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,440
Especially when it’s here in the military,

565
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,440

00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,480
just lacks this kind of man with mind

753
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,880
and combat experience.

754
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,040
They talked directly to the military district,

755
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,360
said they must take this soldier with them.

756
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,160
Great!

757
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,960
Don’t tell me you did it.

758
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,480
My public servant,

759
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,440
how can I not know what he’s capable of?

760
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,840
How can I not inspire his potentials?

761
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,320
I didn’t hear you talked about it even once!

762
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,600
Wang,

763
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,680
in this foreign operation,

764
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,160
I really understood.

765
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,600
They were combating us with special forces.

766
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,600
And they won’t fight you on positional warfare,

767
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,920
won’t give you chances to move in a large scale.

768
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,840
They use top soldiers only.

769
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,360
Synth tactics will be the future war form.

770
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,080
I’m telling you here.

771
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,200
Special forces will be formed soon.

772
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,200
An old acquaintance of mine, Beckwith

773
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,520
wrote a book in America

774
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,200
which has been translated into Chinese.

775
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,840
Do you know who told me this?

776
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,720
Who?

777
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,960
Gao Liang.

778
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,480
What?

779
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,200
He explored the military history

780
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,000
based on the information collected from the army,

781
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,920
and found this man.

782
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,040
Then a comrade’s girlfriend

783
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,720
who is studying in America

784
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,040
found this book.

785
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,400
A soldier was only

786
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,360
three days later

787
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,240
than our Military Information Department.

788
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,080
He was even planning on learning English just to read the book.

789
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,320
But how long would it take?

790
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,680
Considering this, he, even unwillingly,

791
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,200
gave me the book.

792
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,360
Little Wangcheng only knows to learn from Lei Feng,

793
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,920
without learning that someone around us did things like that.

794
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,720
Not everyone can accomplish things like that.

795
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,840
It’s owing to the persistence and respect towards the war.

796
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,600
And you,

797
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,160
finally find your confidant.

798
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,840
The future is on their hands.

799
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,860
[Dormitory]

800
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,600
Gao Liang.

801
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,320
Yes, sir!

802
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,520
Commander.

803
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,280
Are you feeling so good wearing leather shoes?

804
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,360
You can’t stop showing off, can you?

805
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,600
What are you saying?

806
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,600
Division Commander called

807
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,880
and told you to come over.

808
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,280
What’s the matter?

809
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,040
And bring two bottles of wine.

810
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,440
I can’t afford good wine.

811
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,400
Take it easy.

812
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,840
Division Commander said that

813
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,920
just the cheap one would do.

814
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,200
I’ve prepared for you already.

815
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:30,960
Commander.

816
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,040
What kind of cheap wine?

817
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:33,520
Commander.

818
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,400
Here they are.

819
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,720
Here, take them.

820
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,840
Hurry up and go.

821
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,400
- Hurry up. The car is waiting.
- No.

822
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,080
What’s the rush?

823
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,600
Division Commander,

824
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,040
this is my first time

825
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,560
sitting in the back seats with you. I’m...

826
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,200
I’m pretty nervous.

827
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,360
Who are we going to meet with the wine?

828
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,440
Don’t bother to ask.

829
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,320
I have a good news for you.

830
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,120
Infantry College

831
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,000
made a special-recruiting for you.

832
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,720
Chief, you’re the big boss.

833
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,120
Don’t make jokes on me.

834
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,760
How can I be special-recruited

835
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,960
when there’s no quota at all?

836
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,520
Ten more quotas have been allocated

837
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,520
to our division.

838
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,760
Your comrades who had no quotas originally,

839
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,200
can now have the chances.

840
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,440
Are you serious?

841
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,840
Ten quotas?

842
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,560
Then all of us can go there, can’t we?

843
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,400
Chief, I’m telling you.

844
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,280
If I tell this news to Niu Mancang,

845
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,560
the whole squad will wash my underwear for me for a whole year.

846
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,320
Don’t be funny.

847
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,320
You don’t even bother to ask that

848
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,800
how we can get these quotas.

849
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,280
It must be credited to you, Chief.

850
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,680
I have no such power to pull it off.

851
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,720
Then who has?

852
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:46,300
[Raise vigilance, defend the motherland.]

853
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,880
Chief, Chief, is this...

854
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,680
is this the military community?

855
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,400
Why are you taking me here?

856
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,120
What’s going on?

857
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,280
Listen,

858
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,280
I had been a public servant for Deputy Commander Xiao,

859
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,800
just like you for me.

860
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,200
The reason I told you to sit in the back seats with me is to let you know that

861
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,480
we are both public servants

862
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,440
when visiting him.

863
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,600
To tell you the truth,

864
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,040
your quotas for the college

865
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,080
were applied by Deputy Commander Xiao.

866
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,880
Deputy Commander Xiao?

867
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,440
Chief, why didn’t you tell me earlier?

868
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,720
The wine we brought would not

869
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,680
be good enough for visiting Deputy Commander Xiao.

870
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,520
I would borrow money from Qin Dapao

871
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,080
and buy quality liquor if told sooner.

872
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,160
This wine would never be good enough!

873
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,760
How can we bring this kind of wine to Commander?

874
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,440

875
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,640

876
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,560
Report, Division Commander!

878
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,880
Colonel Chen called our duty room

879
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,280
and told me to pass on this information.

884
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,600
kind of missed my former company,

885
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,200

886

00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,560
Those who stayed

940
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,400
could have the uniforms from 1985,

941
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,440
while for those who would leave soon,

942
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,680
uniforms from 1978.

943
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,120
Their different uniforms

944
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,600
signified different paths.

945
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,280
The comrades who were about to leave

946
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,640
would even lose the title of Liberation Army,

947
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,040
the name that all of them once shared.

948
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,840
But they all knew that

949
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,640
they had a common goal

950
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,040
which was making our army much stronger.

951
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,960
You always said that I talked loudly.

952
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,000
But you had no idea

953
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,320
why I did that.

954
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,400
That’s because I was scared.

955
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:11,460
[Be frugal for foods dined. Be grateful for favors received.]

956
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,880
When we were in the war,

957
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,200
my Sergeant was severely injured.

958
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,960
He asked me,

959
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,360
“Are you scared?”

960
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,640
I said yes.

961
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,600
He asked, “What are you scared of?”

962
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,160
I answered, “I was scared of death.”

963
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,760
He said that people would not be scared

964
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,520
if they did die.

965
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,880
I thought that it was the truth.

966
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,680
And then I said,

967
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,560
“I was scared of the ghost.”

968
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,960
He said, “Don’t be.”

969
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,760
“I’m dying.”

970
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,960
“After I die,”

971
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,080
“I will protect you right by your side.”

972
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,840
“Those bad guys that turned into ghosts”

973
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,560
“will dare not to be close to you.”

974
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,080
I’ve not been scared ever since,

975
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,600
because I know that

976
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,240
there are lots of comrades by my side,

977
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,800
watching me, guarding me.

978
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,560
Therefore, from then on,

979
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,520
I’ve talked loudly

980
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,200
for every words.

981
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,960
And I’ve done

982
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,240
everything nicely,

983
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,400
because I know that

984
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,160
they are listening to me

985
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,920
and they are watching me.

986
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:29,880
Come on.

987
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,040
Chief,

988
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,360
your former subordinates said that

989
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,080
if you stayed in Beijing,

990
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,840
you would go on wearing this uniform

991
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,840
and protecting us.

992
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,560
If you leave us,

993
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,680
there will be no one who can help me

994
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,080
to apply for the funds of repairing combat readiness road.

995
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,880
You will be much better with me being gone.

996
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,400
Regardless of what happened before liberation,

997
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,200
from 1960s

998
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,280
when mules were everywhere to see

999
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,000
to today when motorcycles were everywhere to see,

1000
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,200
in these 20 years,

1001
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,480
in just 20 years,

1002
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,560
what kind of changes have taken place in our army?

1003
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,040
But for me, that’s not enough. Not enough.

1004
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,800
In the battlefield, it’s always the faster armies winning over slower ones,

1005
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,240
changing armies winning over non-changing ones,

1006
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,080
and new ones over old ones.

1007
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,560
What use can it be if the army does not welcome revolutionary?

1008
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,440
Take myself for example,

1009
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,640
I, with no doubt,

1010
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,520
have better interpersonal connections than the youngsters.

1011
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,760
However,

1012
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,240
when it comes to study, theories,

1013
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,000
revolutionary and improvement,

1014
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,520
the youngsters are far beyond my reach.

1015
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,120
You can do the math, ten youngsters

1016
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,480
go to the college and become officers

1017
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,320
with just me retiring.

1018
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,920
What a great deal!

1019
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,200
Come on.

1020
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,120
Chief.

1021
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,960
The reason I brought him here today

1022
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,080
is paying tribute to you

1023
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,640
on behalf of his comrades.

1024
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Thanks, Chief!

1025
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,520
Good.

1026
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:19,840
Ceremony completed!

1027
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,320
Today,

1028
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,560
we can dispense the formalities.

1029
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,680
Division Commander Zheng was once my subordinate.

1030
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,320
But,

1031
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,000
unlike me,

1032
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,600
he’s not timorous at all,

1033
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,320
which is an improvement.

1034
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,120
You’re his subordinate,

1035
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,840
thus you need to

1036
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,400
jump over his shoulder as well.

1037
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,600
Yes, sir!

1038
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:46,060
[Be frugal and against waste.]

1039
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,160
Come on, let’s propose a toast again.

1040
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:43,760
Come on.

1041
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,600
Chief,

1042
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,320
your decision

1043
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,960
has changed the lives of ten youngsters,

1044
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,560
and also changed the lives

1045
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,800
of these ten officers-to-be.

1046
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,160
Thanks, Chief!

1047
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,040
After they grow up,

1048
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,440
I believe that

1049
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,080
the path of Liberation Army

1050
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,720
will change greatly.

1051
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,240
Here.

1052
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,400
Deputy Commander Xiao

1053
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,640
declined the appointment to the headquarter,

1054
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,080
and chose to take off the uniform

1055
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,560
with millions of officers and soldiers

1056
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,680
during the disarmament.

1057
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,200
In the autumn and winter of the year,

1058
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,360
military vehicles

1059
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,800
could be seen everywhere.

1060
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,960
Disappearing and evacuation

1061
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,800
shared a similar solemn and stirring atmosphere to be on the warpath.

1062
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,560
That’s a day

1063
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,320
when the two veterans were drunk.

1064
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,340
[Be frugal for foods dined. Be grateful for favors received.]

1065
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,920
Sergeant!

1066
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,960
Soldier Xiao Changsheng

1067
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,880
is reporting to you!

1068
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,760
My final mission assigned by the army

1069
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,840
is leaving.

1070
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,200
Sergeant!

1071
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,120
I promise

1072
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,720
to finish this mission no matter what!

1073
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,680
Sergeant!

1074
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,000
I miss you!
