You finally came.

6
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,729
The superior had informed us to report for duty before the drill.

7
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
But the Military Command gave us a special mission

8
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,729
so we came here hurriedly today.

9
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,250
It's not too late.

10
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,880
Though half of the drill has been finished,

11
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,410

Today's progress of the battle is as follow.

The Red Army

22
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,610
cut the collaborative power of the Blue Army.

23
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,930
The collaboration and supply of Qiaotou Island has been cut.

24

The Red Army

25
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,240
launched a sneak attack

26
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,009
and four strong attacks in total today.

27
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,330
But they still failed to land on the island.

28
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,410
Both parties suffered loss.

29
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,610
So they're in a standoff?

30
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,410
Yes.

31
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,010
In terms of the battle,

32
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:15,920
the Blue Army

33
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,329
has been focused on the intertidal zone of the battle field.

34
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,880
They stopped the Red Army from going forward,

35
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,970
but that's all.

36
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,410
For the Red Army,

37
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,840
they have obvious strength in peripheral firepower

38
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,570
and maneuverable power.

39
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,570
Moreover,

40
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,250
their number of troops is four times bigger than that of the Blue Army,

41
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,600
while their wastage ratio

42
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,810
is far lower than the Blue Army's,

43
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,490
which means that

44
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,040
the Blue Army

45
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,730
has been entirely trapped on the Qiaotou Island.

46
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,560
As they have lost the peripheral collaboration,

47
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,290
we can't see the possibility of further changes.

48
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,010
Who are the commanders of both parties?

49
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,160
The commander of the Red Army

50
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,880
is the acting colonel of Regiment 700,

51
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,370
Gu Yiye.

52
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,930
The commander of the Blue Army

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,910
is the chief of the Special Operations Battalion,

54
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,410
Gao Liang.

55
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,650
Who?

56
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,770
Gu Yiye and Gao Liang.

57
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,450
Are they in command of the drill or just carrying out orders?

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,010
In full command.

59
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,970
That's the idea of the chief of the Military Command.

60
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,850
By the way,

61
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,360

62

63

is also on the island now.

64
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,960
However,

65
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,850
his identity now

66
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,130
is Gao Liang's hostage.

67
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,410

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,970

Let's talk about it later.

80
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,280
Ask the logistics to send a few boxes of milk here.

81
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,960
Meals weren't prepared when we went into the island yesterday.

82
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,570

If they show their true strength,

88
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,560
you would have been captured.

89

Eaglet said

121
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,960
there were only a small number of observation posts on the island.

122
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,730
The observation team has been transferred to the underground fortifications officially.

123
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,880
He has kept us in this hoax

124

00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,010

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,370

00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,240

Yes.

383
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,970
How come you're here?

384
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,680
Haven't you been killed in the blast by me?

385
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,450
Shut up.

386
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,530
You're dead.

387
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:18,680
But…

388
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,810
What?

389
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,640
You thought my command post

390
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,530
was on the Yue Mountain?

391
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,000
Alright.

392
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,800
Say it.

393
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,720
How did you get out of the island?

394
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,690
I won't tell you.

395
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,130
Sergeant,

396
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,120
rest in peace.

397
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:32,680
Let me do it.

398
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,240
Behave yourself.

399
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,250
Don't touch us.

400
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,330
Alright.

401
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,290
Take them out.

402
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:36,890
Yes.

403
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,930
Gu Yiye,

404
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,610
why did you tie me up and take me here?

405
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,320
Let me go.

406
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:41,910
Behave yourself.

407
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,840
Gu Yiye!

408
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,810
Behave yourself.

409
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,890
Report the position

410
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,450
of our command post to the director department.

411
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,750
Inform the second

412
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,650
and the third commandos

413
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,850
to stop attacking,

414
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,170
and withdraw from the fight.

415
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:54,970
Yes.

416
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,890
Report.

417
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,480
Director Xia,

418
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,570
the command post of the Red Army has called.

419
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,210
The command post?

420
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,650
Which command post?

421
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,970
The Red Army's.

422
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:07,920
Transfer the call here.

423
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,490
Yes.

424
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,970
Say it again.

425
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,120
♫ The sun went down. The sunset is glowing ♫

426
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,680
♫ Soldiers were back from shooting range♫

427
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,600
♫ shooting range ♫

428
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,530
How come the result is like this?

429
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,770
We clearly have controlled the situation.

430
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,080
Our Regiment 700

431
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,050
did have chance to win.

432
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,400
Asked four frogmen

433
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,810
to take down the command post?

434
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,520
That's why they're called

435
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,650
the Special Operations Battalion.

436
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,690
That's what they're specialized in.

437
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,360
They just like to do…

438
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,210
Keep it down.

439
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,040
If I'm going to invite the chief and other leaders to a meal,

440
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,210
what do you think we should eat?

441
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,770
Out.

442
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,610
How could you…

443
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,210
…have such an attitude?

444
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,850
Eat instant noodles.

445
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,130
Let's wait for the news after we finish eating.

446
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,770
What news should we wait for?

447
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,530
The Red Army's command post hasn't been blasted.

448
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,850
The director department

449
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,370
is trying to verify the situation.

450
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,370
Wait. Wait..

451
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,200
It hasn't been blasted?

452
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,410
How so?

453
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,800
The commander of the Red Army moved their command post

454
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,960
from the Yue Mountain

455
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,840
to the

456
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,330
to the Teng Mountain.

457
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,970
The Blue Army's frogmen only

458
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,130
blasted the original command post

459
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,050
and their First Commando.

460
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,930
Good job.

461
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,930
Gu Yiye

462
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,050
is really something.

463
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,530
It means Gu Yiye

464
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,050
is still alive.

465
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,490
He isn't dead?

466
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,890
Then why did the director department make a false report about the military situation?

467
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,280
It made me

468
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,610
almost have a heart failure.

469
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,090
Chief,

470
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,220
[Chief Coordinator]

471
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,930
the director department has verified it.

472
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,200
It's true that the Red Army's

473
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,290
command post isn't on the Yue Mountain.

474
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,770
The director department determines that

475
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,490
the Blue Army's Beheading Action is not successful.

476
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,410
The drill goes on.

477
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,690
Is there any point to continue?

478
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,080
The director department also thought so

479
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:01,970
ten minutes ago.

480
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,330
After the Red Army lost this chance to attack,

481
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,970
it would be hard for them

482
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,170
to launch an attack again before dark.

483
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,210
After it gets dark,

484
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,250
the Blue Army will gain the advantage instead.

485
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,890
But the premise is that

486
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,400
the Red Army's command post

487
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:14,970
has been taken down.

488
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,210
However, this premise doesn't exist now.

489
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,720
Considering about the materials

490
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,520
sent by the Mountain Net Number Two

491
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,720
about the combat logic of

492
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,170
the Red Army's commander,

493
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,550
the director department has estimated that

494
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,400
within the five hours

495
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,170
and forty-four minutes before dark,

496
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,050
there might be a miracle.

497
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,250
What miracle?

498
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,050
Mountain Net Number Two analyzed that

499
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,850
the commander of the Red Army

500
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,080
has a meticulous logic about combat,

501
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,130
and is good at planning every step carefully.

502
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,330
During

503
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,770
the 997 Action in 1999,

504
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,130
and the Guang 20 Drill in 2000,

505
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,690
he once used irregular approaches

506
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,330
and got victory.

507
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,850
Mountain Net Number Two thinks that

508
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,650
this time

509
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,890
he may also do this.

510
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,530
If that's the case,

511
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,330
the situation

512
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,490
may be reserved.

513
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,130
What's wrong?

514
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,810
Is my order not clear enough?

515
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,000
But there are so many reefs on the east and north sides

516
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,730
of the Qiaotou Island.

517
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,530
We are not able to launch attacks at all.

518
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,240
If we choose to land on the island from those two places,

519
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,410
we'll suffer great loss.

520
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,490
Right.

521
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,370
It's true we will lose some men.

522
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,850
But just think about it.

523
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,600
If we expand one landing target

524
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,690
to three,

525
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,520
the Blue Army's limited military strength

526
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,490
will also be distracted.

527
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,050
Keep attacking them,

528
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,130
their weakness will surely be discovered.

529
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,530
Don't leave any reserve forces here.

530
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,050
All the troops should join the attack.

531
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,720
There are few firing point left on the island

532
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,490
for the Blue Army.

533
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,130
Our number is four times bigger than theirs.

534
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,810
Even if we should fight by the quantity of soldiers,

535
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,690
I would send all men to fight bloodily with them.

536
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,770
It's a strategy to perish together.

537
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,530
Right.

538
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,050
That's what I want.

539
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,010
You might ask

540
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,210
what will be

541
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,090
the cost.

542
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,330
Soldiers

543
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,450
aren't merchants.

544
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,200
No bargain

545
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,090
if it relates to sovereignty.

546
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,410
During the War of Resistance Against Japan,

547
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,160
that island

548
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,610
was occupied by the Japanese.

549
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,170
It was given back

550
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,850
to our country after seven years.

551
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,250
I ask you.

552
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,440
If the island were still

553
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,690
occupied by the Japanese now,

554
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,490
and the country needed us to fight

555
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,410
and take it back,

556
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,210
would you still calculate the cost?

557
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,010
Fight!

558
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,650
Fight!

559
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,850
Even if I might die, I would take it back.

560
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,750
Action!

561
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,330
Yes.

562
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,170
Comrades,

563
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,840
the last battle

564
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,610
of the Operation Azure will begin soon.

565
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,330
In four and a half hours,

566
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,570
no matter how fierce the battle is,

567
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,410
the sun will set.

568
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,370
The battle

569
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,530
will also end.

570
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,580
[Bayi]

571
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,170
Now we're facing

572
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,290
an enemy whose number is several times bigger than ours.

573
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,010
This is their last chance.

574
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,210
They will also have the resolution

575
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,530
to win like us.

576
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,920
Rush to us

577
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,370
and fight bloodily with us.

578
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,410
At this time,

579
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,650
I want to tell you

580
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,280
we don't have enough military strength

581
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,690
to fight a war of attrition.

582
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,770
So

583
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,250
at this point,

584
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,960
you are chosen

585
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,130
as elites.

586
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,610
Comrades,

587
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,610
ready to go.

588
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,290
Let's

589
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,770
end this battle.

590
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,130
Yes!

591
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,050
It sounds so heroic.

592
00:24:59,080 --> 00:24:59,770
Buddies,

593
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,450
we're special troops.

594
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,210
We always perform

595
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,690
the toughest

596
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,990
and most difficult

597
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:06,970
tasks among all the troops.

598
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,810
Today,

599
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:10,960
the twelve of you

600
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,170
have been chosen.

601
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,130
The purpose is to protect our country's territory

602
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,680
and win more time

603
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,330
for our army

604
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,880
so that our comrades

605
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,010
are able to prevent the enemy from landing on the island.

606
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,650
This time

607
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,290
there will be no returning for you.

608
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,210
The instructor and I

609
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,170
are saying goodbye to you here.

610
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,730
For this action,

611
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,490
we only have a few words.

612
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,930
We'd rather go forward and die

613
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,970
than step back and stay alive.

614
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,160
We'd rather go forward and die

615

than step back and stay alive.

616
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,850
We'd rather go forward and die

617
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,610
than step back and stay alive.

We'd rather go forward and die

620
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,210
than step back and stay alive.

Number One,

625
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,280
the enemy's attack is very intensive.

626
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,240
We've repelled their attack for three times.

627
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,570
The second battalion has suffered heavy losses.

628
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,400
Two hundred and sixty-two people quit the battle,

629
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,530
more than half of our establishment number.

630
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,170
How is it going on the northeastern side?

631
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,160
It's a bit better there,

632
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,390
but there are also some losses.

633
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,400
The instructor and his men

634
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,490
are also have great pressure.

635
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,970
The enemy try to suppress the First Company by firepower.

636
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,040
They operate forcibly

637
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,250
and blow up the reefs.

638
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,480
The instructor applies for

639
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,970
the backup of flat fire guns.

640
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,240
Tell the instructor

641
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,240
to hang in there.

642
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,530
This is the enemy's plot.

643
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,480
Unless there is no other way,

644
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,570
we can't mobilize the reserve forces.

645
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,490
Yes.

646
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,290

Twelve powered hang gliders

652
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,370
have been released from the island.

653
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,480
What's their purpose?

654
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,190
They're flying towards the landing team.

655
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,330
We're not sure about their purpose now.

656
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,490
Shoot them down.

657
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,810
Don't let them get close to the landing team.

658
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,970
Yes.

659
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,890

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,770

The southwestern side has fallen.

676
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,520
The enemy have landed on the island successfully.

677
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,000
They've built a beachhead

678
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,210
at the depth of two hundred meters.

679
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,400
The instructor has also lost all his men.

680
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,450
They can't keep their place anymore.

681
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,850
Inform the commander of the Third Company

682
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,530
withdraw to the underground fortifications.

686
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,770
a supporting beachhead,

687
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,570
there will be more troops landing on the island.

688
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,280
Then

689
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,890
we'll be besieged.

690
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,080

00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,810

We are not being besieged,

693
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,610
but entrapping them.

694
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,280
It does not depend on the duration,

695
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,200
but the approaches.

There are thirty minutes left to end the drill.

700
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,930
It's impossible that the Red Army can defeat the Blue Army.

701
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,690

Yes.

But time isn't enough.

705
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,330

00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,890
to withdraw to the underground fortifications.

712

00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,090
A plan is a plan.

765
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,400
But Mountain Net Number Two

766
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,320
needs the overall and complete parameters of the drill

767
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,090
so as to get the final result accurately.

768
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,800
If the drill ends halfway,

769
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,600
there will be a lack of necessary steps and data.

770
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,210
The research project can't be continued.

771
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,050
Your words make sense.

772
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,090
However,

773
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,200
our whole plan of the drill

774
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,570
has been reported to the Military Command for record.

775
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,810
Our troops must

776
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,920
carry out the Military Command's official reply unconditionally.

777
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,490
There mustn't be any alteration.

778
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,280
But chief…

779
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,890
Chief.

780
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,650
Chief Zheng of the observation team has called.

781
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,360
Transfer it here.

782
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,130
Yes.

783
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:39,580
Hello.

784
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,210
Have you given the order to end the drill?

785
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,410
I'll give it at once.

786
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,410
Stop it.

787
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,970
Don't give the order.

788
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:46,730
Why not?

789
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,370
He,

790
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,730
this is a critical moment.

791
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,080
Chief, what do you mean?

792
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,130
Think about the predetermined

793
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,850
plans given by both parties before the drill,

794
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,410
and the director department's

795
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,130
analysis of them.

796
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,200
Have you discovered two things?

797
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,280
Firstly,

798
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,650
the Red Army emphasizes stability greatly,

799
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:05,930
and is not flexible enough.

800
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,530
Except for the first attack

801
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,080
and this offensive with irregular approaches,

802
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,130
they barely have any other tactics.

803
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,880
And the Blue Army

804
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,280
is poorly prepared for handling the transition of attacking

805
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,170
and defending.

806
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,290
They have never changed their attitude from attacking

807
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,560
to defending.

808
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,890
This exposes the problems existing in the troops.

809
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:27,930
Secondly,

810
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,000
The combat practice of both parties

811
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,280
doesn't proceed according to

812
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,170
the predetermined plans provided by them.

813
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,720
After the start of the drill,

814
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,290
their logic and tactics

815
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,370
changed rapidly.

816
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,370
By now,

817
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,610
the drill has exceeded the old pattern.

818
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,080
I can understand.

819
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,600
At this point of the drill,

820
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,290
the predetermined plans no longer work.

821
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,970
This trend is more like a real battle.

822
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,280
The director department has also discovered these problems

823
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,170
and we are confused.

824
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,810
Chief, your analysis

825
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,970
has enlightened us.

826
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,480
For this circumstance,

827
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,730
even the director department, observation team

828
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,800
and the participating troops of the drill

829
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,090
have never experienced it before.

830
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,290
Superior commanders like us

831
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,530
have never experienced it, too.

832
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,449
However, the drill is getting more and more similar to a real battle.

833
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,679
Not only their tactics

834
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,280
but also their attitudes

835
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,120
are like those in a real battle.

836
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,449
This is a rare chance.

837
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,760
No drill we used to have

838
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,130
can compare with it.

839
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,280
It makes sense.

840
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,530
He, don't stop the drill.

841
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,050
Let them continue

842
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,010
until the final result comes out.

843
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,719
If we persist,

844
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,130
it will be very beneficial for our troops.

845
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,170
But chief,

846
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,050
if we let the drill continue,

847
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,920
it'll be dangerous.

848
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,320
No planning. No prearrangement.

849
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,280
No predetermined plan.

850
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,560
If we continue like this, it might lead to a mess.

851
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,050
It's not safe, chief.

852
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,810
I also thought about the same thing.

853
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,800
Both the commanders of the red and blue armies are young

854
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,670
and inexperienced.

855
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,679
They've never experienced

856
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,600
a drill like this.

857
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,730
Nor have we had such experience.

858
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,530
It's the first time for all of us.

859
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,880
If we continue,

860
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,080
it's not a possibility

861
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,650
but a certainty to become messy and even

862
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,450
have some trouble.

863
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,130
However, He,

864
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,810
the army has a different view

865
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,570
on safety with others.

866
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,640
The army thinks that

867
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,040
we have to make sure soldiers are able to fight in the battle field,

868
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,360
and can win after joining the fight.

869
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,930
We have to make sure they can be useful for the country.

870
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,290
No losing the sovereignty or any territory.

871
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,130
Protect our countrymen from being bullied.

872
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,210
From this perspective,

873
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,250
continuing the drill

874
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,930
is the safest choice.

875
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,050
But if we continue the drill,

876
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,930
there will be a series of new problems.

877
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,010
For example,

878
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,760
the purpose of the battle,

879
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,000
the supply for both parties,

880
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,290
and the ending time of the battle.

881
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,720
The director department must give

882
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,760
a reason to continue the drill.

883
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,000
Moreover, we need to get approval from the Military Command.

884
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,520
Chief,

885
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,040
chief, the purpose of the drill

886
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,360
has been determined previously.

887
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,250
It's to get the control power on the island.

888
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,410
We shouldn't change the purpose.

889
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,050
On the first stage of the drill,

890
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,240
the Red Army defeated the collaborative power of the Blue Army,

891
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,840
blocked their electronic communication,

892
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,850
and cut off their contact with the outside world.

893
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,440
The Blue Army is like being on an isolated island now,

894
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,650
being unable to get any supply.

895
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,160
But the Red Army's supply conditions

896
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,490
haven't been eliminated by the Blue Army.

897
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,530
Wars aren't estimated by time

898
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,650
but the result.

899
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,400
Who is talking there?

900
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,730
Vice director of the research group of Mountain Net Number Two,

901
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,490
Jiang Nanzheng.

902
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,250
He,

903
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,000
the reasons given by Lt Col Jiang are very sensible.

904
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,330
The director department should think about them carefully.

905
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,610
I suggest

906
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,520
to give supply to the Red Army

907
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,080
under limited conditions

908
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,290
and no supply to the Blue Army.

909
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,330
Continue the drill

910
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,530
until the result comes out.

911
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,920
Report to the Military Command first.

912
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,010
Tell them it's my idea.

913
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,120
Then send a report

914
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,570
to the Military Command in the name of our troops.

915
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,730
I'll call Commander Zhao later.

916
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,960
I know the situation here the best.

917
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,160
Otherwise, I would be an incompetent director

918
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:47,810
of the observation team.

919
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,810
Yes.

920
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:49,810
Chief,

921
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,000
I'll call the Military Command at once.

922
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,130
Meanwhile, I won't declare the closing of the drill for time being,

923
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,970
and will wait for the superior's reply.

924
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,570
All members of Special Forces

925
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,690
attack them fiercely.

926
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,410
All the Red Army retreat.

927
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,010
Time is nearly up.

928
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:56,740
[Blue Army Director, Chief Director, Red Army Director]

929
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,610
Chief, the Blue Army has launched a counter-attack.

930
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,160
Director Xia,

931
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,610
shall we inform the participating troops to end the drill?

932
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,730
I'm He Zhigeng.

933
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,590
Yes.

934
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,120
The drill continues.

935
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:15,850
Chief,

936
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,090
our drill this time has aroused the headquarters' attention.

937
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,370
The headquarters keep a watchful eye on it.

938
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,530
Number One Chief of the Military Command

939
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,170
has asked Vice Commander Meng

940
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,960
to take the combat troops of Military Command

941
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,290
and officers over the division level

942
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,720
to the site of the drill

943
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,880
for watching and learning.

944
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,650
Okay. Got it.

945
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,650
So the Number One Chief intervene personally?

946
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,690
Twenty years ago,

947
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,250
I saw him on the train of new recruits for the first time.

948
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,730
He stole Instructor Lu's uniform.

949
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,910
and tricked all the people successfully.

950
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,630
From then on,

951
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,550
I've been wanting to kick his ass.

952
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,710
For these twenty years,

953
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,870
we've fought with each other for many times.

954
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:06,950
In terms of victory,

955
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,870
I've won more times than him.

956
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,670
But it's not until today that I realize

957
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,510
I've never defeated him truly.

958
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,430
Number One,

959
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,820
the director department has asked us

960
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,150
to submit the supply list of personnel and equipment.

961
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,670
Take record.

962
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:26,190
Three rounds of firepower backup by six bombers.

963
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:29,790
Two rounds of firepower strike by four  Oriental 11.

964
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,590
Number One.

965
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,890
Well,

966
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:33,830
the Blue Army has sent

967
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,630
more than a team of frogmen to the periphery of the island.

968
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,410
Search the reefs within

969
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,930
ten kilometers' distance from the Qiaotou Island.

970
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,650
Remove all

971
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,890
his infiltrators.

972
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,890
Yes.

973
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,090
The drill director department has informed

974
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,530
to continue the drill

975
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,070
until the result comes out.

976
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:50,130
But the director department won't offer us any supply.

977
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,770
We also won't get any new soldiers if we lose some men.

978
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,210
Got it.

979
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,960
Fortunately, I've brought

980
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,130
all the resources I have.

981
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,890
Half of the ammunition is left.

982
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,440
But half of the equipment is gone.

983
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,490
All these things aren't important.

984
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,720
What matters is that

985
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,930
we've lost one third of our soldiers.

986
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,200
Now they say they won't add new members to us.

987
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,890
With no supplement of soldiers, how do I continue the fight?

988
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,210
Should I go up the mountains to catch some monkeys

989
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,570
or go to the sea to catch some tortoises?

990
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:14,800
I just catch them,

991
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,370
and give each of them two guns to charge forward.

992
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,640
Why are you guys so stingy?

993
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,330
You've brought no food at all.

994
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,320
The fight lasted for half a day yesterday.

995
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,650
We didn't have time to eat.

996
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,530
We could only rely on the biscuits,

997
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,210
canned food and sausages we'd brought with us.

998
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,410
Let me tell you what has been left.

999
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,970
Some rice is left as we skipped two meals yesterday.

1000
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,210
Two bottle of oil.

1001
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,570
And some vegetables.

1002
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,410
Almost all of the vegetables have got rotten.

1003
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,360
Those old guys of the director department asked me

1004
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,080
to figure out some solutions myself.

1005
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,160
I figure out some solutions myself?

1006
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,760
But how?

1007
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,530
What's more, the freshwater

1008
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,090
has been poisoned by the Blue Army.

1009
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,440
Luckily, the water in the spare pond

1010
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,650
wasn't discovered by them.

1011
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,570
But it'll be used up soon.

1012
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,410
We're discussing.

1013
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,410
The Red Army asks for supplement of soldiers.

1014
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,600
Even if they don't agree,

1015
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,930
they should give us half a day's time.

1016
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,440
Ask our troops to take a rest

1017
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,210
and re-construct our positions.

1018
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,360
After half an hour,

1019
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,370
meet with me at the observation pointon on the main peak

1020
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,170
to make a battle plan.

1021
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,490
Besides,

1022
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,480
figure out a way to solve the problem of supply at once.

1023
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,570
I'm starving.

1024
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,650
Where are you going?

1025
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,970
I'm going to check those old men,

1026
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,090
to make sure they're still fine.

1027
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:26,770
Chief,

1028
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,690
if the troops have no supply,

1029
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,690
how does the drill go on?

1030
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,810
Despite other things,

1031
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,490
our observation team

1032
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,040
should get the supplements, huh?

1033
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:39,760
Yes.

1034
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,570
Right.

1035
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,680
With disadvantageous terrain,

1036
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,490
strange combat environment,

1037
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,610
extremely tough conditions,

1038
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,290
and complicated and fickle situation in the battle field,

1039
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,730
it's easier for the troops to discover potential problems

1040
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,280
and be tested.

1041
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,890
I'm not talking about the troops.

1042
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,530
I'm talking about the observation team.

1043
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,610
We're hostages now.

1044
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,090
The treatment is different now.

1045
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,360
No, chief.

1046
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,520
The hostages shouldn't starve.

1047
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,360
If they get ill from the starvation,

1048
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,960
it'll be meaningless to have hostages.

1049
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,290
It's useless.

1050
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,930
-Gao Liang. -Come on.

1051
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,570
Gao Liang.

1052
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:15,970
Well done.

1053
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,090
You haven't been defeated by Regiment 700 for these two days.

1054
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,170
Good.

1055
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,490
I'll put more bet on it.

1056
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,970
In the next 24 hours,

1057
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:24,810
no,

1058
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:25,610
30 hours,

1059
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,800
if you can still hold on

1060
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,650
for the next 30 hours,

1061
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,170
I'll take the lead

1062
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,850
to ask all the cadres of the Special Forces

1063
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,090
to lift you up over the heads

1064
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,290
and take a turn around the site of Special Troops.

1065
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,370
No way.

1066
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,090
Let me lift you up.

1067
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,210
What's wrong, Song?

1068
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,240
What do you mean?

1069
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:45,890
Anything wrong?

1070
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,580
Supplements.

1071
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,770
There are still some food in the troops.

1072
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,770
I've told them

1073
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,360
to give each person two meals and three bottle

1074
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,570
of water a day.

1075
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,410
Salt will be enough.

1076
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,610
Forget the shower. You won't be starved.
