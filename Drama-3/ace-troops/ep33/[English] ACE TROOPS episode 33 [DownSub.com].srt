194
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,160
Take more pairs of rubber shoes and boots.

195
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,080
Take the diving suit.

196
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,960
Yes.

197
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,040
Why are you still standing here.

198
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,280
Get out of here.

199
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,280
I am busy.

200
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,000
Captain.

201
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,680
Twenty-eight of my

202
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,040
soldiers live in the Yangtze valley,

203
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,480
their homes are inside the stricken area,

204
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,040
and I am here watching other divisons

205
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,800
to fight against the flood

206
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,720
while myself getting married at home.

207
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,680
What am I going to say to my soldiers?

208
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,880
I say that because your battalion commander is getting married,

209
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,560
other battalions will need to go to the front line to fight against the flood and rescue,

210
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,400
we will be at home to attend the wedding and make fish stew.

211
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,040
Does it make sense to you?

212
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,520
How am I going to lead my team in the future?

213
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,520
You teach me.

214
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,480
Hold it.

215
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,880
You can put the dynamite here for him.

216
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,520
Subprefect Chen.

217
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,720
Thanks for assisting us.

218
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,760
By the urgent notice of Flood Prevention Command of this province,

219
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,320
we are required to

220
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,320
carry out the explosion at the Changchun Levee

221
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,960
which is completely flooded.

222
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,400
In this way, we can drain part of the water

223
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,760
into Nanwa River to

224
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,880
relieve the pressure at the middle and lower reaches.

225
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,640
Setting up the points of burst

226
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,880
and burrying tons of dynamites

227
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,680
should be our Department of water and power's responsibility.

228
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,000
But we are unable to complish the diving operation.

229
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,200
We will do it.

230
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,080
Just tell me, what should I do.

231
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,960
Dive to the coverway,

232
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,320
and burry the dynamites at the four cross joints.

233
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,600
The river is fast flowing now,

234
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,960
the deepest position is

235
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,960
30 meters deep.

236
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,400
So the situation is very dangerous.

237
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,520
The mission will be accomplished.

238
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,160
Gather the Special forces team.

239
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,200

[Use knowledge to arm the brain, use responsibility to secure communication]

242
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,120
this is great.

243
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,160
This working distance has increased 5 times,

244
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,440
the signal decay index is only

245
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,480
a quarter of Mountain Net Number One.

246
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,320
Also, its containment of technical parameters

247
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,440
have enlarged 100 times.

248
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,200
Call Director Zhao right away and report.

249
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,000
Yes.

250
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,800
I am here.

251
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,280
Senior company commander.

252
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,620
Mountain Net Number One's system is successfully upgraded.

253
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,880
Congratulations, Nanzheng.

254
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,160
You have defeated yourself.

255
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,280
It's not easy.

256
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,200
Don't be thrilled just yet.

257
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,990
We have received the order from headquarters just now,

258
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,200

259
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,800
within one hour.

260
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,960
Follow the main force

261
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,480
and move towards Northern Hunan by motorbikes and cars.

262
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,040
When the flood peak passes through

263
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,840
Dongxiang protective embankment,

264
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,720
we will face the danger of serious levee breach.

265
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,830
Special Forces team A and Division 700 both need our

266
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,240
support immediately.

267
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,680

274
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,960
Gao Liang was supposed to stay,

275
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,160
but he gathered his batallion

276
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,440
and handed in application for battle.

277
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,480
This is his habit,

278
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,160
he would face to the difficulties

279
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,680
whenever there is a critical moment.

280
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,240
He is a fighter,

281
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,520
this is the Gao Liang I love.

282
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,200

No.

Tuanjie Levee is my place.

344
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,280
It is my business to go down,

345
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,520
what does it have to do with you?

346
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,920
Because I am better in water.

347
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,000
Admit it.

348
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,240

we just need to follow.

350
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,240
Are you sure

351
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,360
you will come back as a whole?

352
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,080
你What are you talking about?

You still have Xiu and kid.

356

I am different.

357
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,040
Your mission is to block the pipe,

358
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,320
if you cannot do it,

359
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,880
I won't be able to come back for real.

360
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,560
Save it.

361
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,440

00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,680
I will come back.

363
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,120

00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,360
during that swim across training in Venezuela.

365
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,920
The situation underwater this time

366
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,560
is more complicated than that time.

367
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,080
Promise me

368
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,520

Don't talk nonsense,

370
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,320
go back to your position.

371
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,640

Tell Nanzheng that

375
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,640
I love her.

376
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,920
You tell her by yourself.

377
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,520
Gao Liang and his comrades

378
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,400
jumped into the water without any fear.

379
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,080
At that moment,

380
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,960
I realized what it is like to feel your heart is rended.

we need to think another way.

757
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,400
Right.

758
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,720
I need to think another way.

759
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,920
I am going to marry him and

760
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,600
become his legal wife.

761
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,200
Nanzheng,

762
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,320
you cannot solve anything doing like this.

763
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,000
I just want him

764
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,960
to be happy everyday

765
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,200
until the last moment of his life.

766
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,840
He would not be alone

767
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,280
with me.

768
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,640
I love him,

769
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,720
it is our mutual wish for

770
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,880
us to become his bride.

771
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,600
Nanzheng, we are touched by

772
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,320
what you are doing.

773
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,080
But, unless he is coming back alive,

774
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,640
unless he gives you a healthy body.

775
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,960
I think by then,

776
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,880
he will try his best to marry you and

777
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,000
ask you to become his happiest bride.

778
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,480
So what we need to do is

779
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,280
to try our best

780
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,600
to make him live,

781
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,520
right?

782
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,360
But doctor Lou has announced his death.

783
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,440
I don't believe it.

784
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,960
I don't believe it either.

785
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,080
Medicine has rapidly developed,

786
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,280
and the world is so vast,

787
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,200
we will find an expert to

788
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,640
cure Gao Liang.

789
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,040
What we need to do now

790
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,320
is to find this person,

791
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,200
right?

792
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:19,980
[Central hospital of Military Command -burn medicine center of People's Liberation Army]

793
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,000
Yiye,

794
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,000
thank you,

795
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,400
for real.

796
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,920
Thanks for telling me.

797
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,120
In this way,

798
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,880
I know

799
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,800
how to live the rest of

800
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,360
my life.

801
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,600
I, Gao Liang,

802
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,040
even my death needs to be honourable.

803
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,400
Alright,

804
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,520
don't say something like this.

805
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:44,880
Right,

806
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,840
Nanzheng,

807
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,760
she has been struggling.

808
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,760
I cannot talk her out of it.

809
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,280
She went back to Military Command

810
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,880
and filed marriage certificate.

811
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,800
She said she want to be your bride

812
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,440
and make you happy

813
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,480
in the future days of your life.

814
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,920
Yiye,

815
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,680
actually

816
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,480
the God treats me very well.

817
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,280
I have a brother like you,

818
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,800
and a lover like Nanzheng,

819
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,600
it is enough.

820
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,280
But I don't want to die,

821
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,560
still want to live.

822
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,720
I still want to fight with you

823
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,800
and Nanzheng is still waiting for me.

824
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,800
Yiye,

825
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,160
there are still a lot of things I haven't done yet.

826
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,520
Yiye,

827
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,440
I don't want to die, Yiye.

828
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,440
Don't be panicked,

829
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,680
it is also good to let it out

830
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,840
and calm down.

831
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,160
Don't say death so easily,

832
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,280
it is not that easy to die.

833
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,880
Nobody could give up,

834
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,160
we will try together.

835
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:10,880
Yiye,

836
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,400
Yiye.

837
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,760
Stay longer.

838
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,200
Stay longer.

839
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,280
Old pale, I think

840
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,960
we cannot let Zheng do whatever she wants for this.

841
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,240
Zheng is not a kid anymore,

842
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,400
she is a soldier who is

843
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,920
in the Army for more than ten years.

844
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,400
This is not temperament,

845
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,400
but it is too costly for

846
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,640
Zheng's future.

847
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,800
Zheng knows her own mind,

848
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,440
she wants to show Gao Liang her love

849
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,720
and to save him

850
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,320
using action.

851
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,720
I am very gratified,

852
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,320
I know what this means

853
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,160
to Zheng by doing this.

854
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,840
If I stop her,

855
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,400
she will be heartbroken for whole life.

856
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,160
So I agree with her choice.

857
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,200
Qin Hanyong does not agree.

858
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,080
You tell Qin Hanyong that I agree,

859
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,280
as a father

860
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,440
and army commander of group army A.

861
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,080
I am proud for my daughter's choice.

862
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,320
At this time,

863
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,320
none of us has right to give up.

864
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,360
Connect me to Qin Hanyong from Special Forces.

865
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,400
Are you OK?

866
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,920
What do you mean?

867
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,040
Chen Dashan does not like you.

868
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,920
I know you are hard

869
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,680
because you cannot do whatever you want.

870
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,440
It is lonely.

871
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:04,880
So,

872
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,560
you need to get well soon.

873
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:09,840
Right,

874
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,520
tactics battle of next week.

875
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:14,840
I got your

876
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,160
mission.

877
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,840
Get well soon.

878
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,160
Otherwise I will take

879
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,840
more and more advantages of you.

880
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,840
Take it.

881
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,760
Train yourself more

882
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,800
and train for me.

883
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,240
If I am not capable,

884
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,520
you would need to be on the battlefield

885
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,920
when enemy comes.

886
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,960
You will need to go on behalf of me.

887
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,200
We go and fight against them as two brothers.

888
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:49,800
Gao,

889
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,000
promise me,

890
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,280
we would not escape.

891
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,200
We will stay on the ground

892
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:58,960
until our last breath.
