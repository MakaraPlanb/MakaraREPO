1
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,240
Chief,

2
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,800
I insist on repairing the road

3
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,280
even for being damned.

4
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,720
Chief,

5
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,360
I’m really scared.

6
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,440
At the end of last year,

7
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,200
the main force of Division 234

8
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,479
was stuck on the highway for 12 hours

9
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,720
during the Southern 83 Exercise.

10
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,240
I have never been afraid in all my years as a soldier.

11
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,080
I’m really scared this time.

12
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:01,800
I’m afraid that

13
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,480
when the country needs us in the field,

14
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,200
we won’t be able to make it.

15
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,750
The war will be lost before it has even begun.

16
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,120
The thought of this

17
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,840
makes me break out in a cold sweat.

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,120
If our Division 234 is not the main force,

19
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,800
there will be no problem in repairing the road a few years later.

20
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,320
Once the war comes,

21
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,520
there will be the main force in front of us.

22
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,440
But chief,

23
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,160
we are the main division.

24
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,520
We are the first motorized infantry division

25
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,640
in the entire military district.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,440
Once the war breaks out,

27
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,320
who will stand in front of us?

28
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,640
Are you lecturing me?

29
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,800
Well, the porridge smells good.

30
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,920
It makes me hungry.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,840
Let me have a taste first.

32
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,960
That’s not for you.

33
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:48,280
One, two, three, four.

34
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,440
The Ninth Company is back.

35
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,600
One, two, three, four.

36
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,440
Hurry up, keep up.

37
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,520
Rest in place for a minute.

38
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,820
[Outstanding community-level officers and soldiers. Advanced community-level company.]

39
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,280
Stop.

40
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,280
All attention!

41
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,560
Stand at attention!

42
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,680
Dress right!

43
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,560
Eyes front!

44
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,840
Comrade deputy commander,

45
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,480
the Ninth Company has completed its training plan

46
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,880
and has returned to the camp.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,760
Please give instructions.

48
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,079
Company Commander Qin Hanyong.

49
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,480
Stand at ease, please.

50
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,120
Yes, chief.

51
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,400
Stand at ease.

52
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,360
Qin Hanyong.

53
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,040
Yes.

54
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,960
Why did you come back now?

55
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,880
Chief,

56
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,200
two kilometers of highway roadbed

57
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,320
had been washed away

58
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,560
and vehicles could not pass through.

59
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,000
We could only get off the bus and walk for six hours,

60
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:47,920
climb over Banyueling

61
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,079
and return to the camp.

62
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:50,760
Chief,

63
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
we did not return to the camp

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,400
beyond the time stipulated

65
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,200
in the training plan.

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,600
Great.

67
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,560
Comrades,

68
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,840
I see something

69
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,240
in your eyes.

70
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,960
Something that

71
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,960
I once saw in the eyes of my comrades

72
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,760
on the Long March.

73
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,000
On the anti-Japanese front,

74
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,320
I saw it in the eyes of

75
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,000
the officers and soldiers of the Iron Hiker Regiment.

76
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,440
In the Korean battlefield,

77
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,920
I also saw it in the eyes of

78
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,240
the officers and men of

79
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,680
the Division 234 of the volunteer army.

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,760
That is the determination

81
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,600
to complete the task,

82
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,440
to overwhelm the enemy

83
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,360
and to seize the victory!

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,200
Comrades, you have worked hard!

85
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,040
Here are my orders.

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,680
Stand at attention.

87
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,440
Target Canteen

88
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:56,960
It’s dinner time.

89
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,240
Yes, Chief.

90
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,440
Er Ganzi.

91
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,280
After all these years with me,

92
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,560
can you see

93
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,000
why I care so much about

94
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,560
the food and shelter of my soldiers?

95
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,160
Chief,

96
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,120
When you were a soldier,

97
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,880
the troops were in poor condition and

98
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,600
logistics were not perfect at that time.

99
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,440
Our troops

100
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,400
have come from hard times.

101
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,800
In fact,

102
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,960
regardless of the era,

103
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,600
being a soldier is the most bitter.

104
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,960
For example,

105
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,960
I have sacrificed

106
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,480
many comrades

107
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,159
all the way from the Red Army period.

108
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,200
I can’t even remember

109
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,080
how many of my comrades

110
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,440
were killed by a bullet

111
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,720
with delicious food on their backs

112
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,600
or new shoes made by their mothers

113
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,480
or wives in their bags.

114
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,120
In the end,

115
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,760
when people died,

116
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,720
they left behind delicious food and clothes.

117
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,720
So,

118
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:06,900
[Learn from Comrade Lei Feng. Mao Zedong]

119
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,200
the last thing I can tolerate is

120
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,120
to keep the soldiers waiting.

121
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,120
However,

122
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,920
you’re right too.

123
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,600
A meal's late for six hours.

124
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,280
If there is a war,

125
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,560
some soldiers

126
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,000
may not get the meal.

127
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,680
I admit my mistake.

128
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,000
Chief, it’s my fault.

129
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,080
I pushed too hard.

130
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,560
I’ll

131
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,880
make a statement to you two.

132
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,440
The barracks

133
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,200
need to be renovated,

134
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,800
but your readiness road

135
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,080
needs to be repaired as well.

136
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,120
Thank you, Chief.

137
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,480
What?

138
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,040
Many thanks to Chief.

139
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,600
Well, I will immediately convey the good news

140
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,360
to all officers and soldiers in the division.

141
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,560
Thanks, Chief.

142
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,000
Political Commissar,

143
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,960
this trip to the headquarters of Deputy Commander Xiao

144
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,200
asked for the money

145
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,920
for road repairing for us.

146
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,600
The older, the wiser.

147
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,040
Have a seat, please.

148
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,640
Deputy Commander Xiao said that

149
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,520
this is due to

150
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,080
the report you wrote.

151
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,680
After reading the letter,

152
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,840
the head officer in charge of logistics

153
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,520
was in tears.

154
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,880
It’s your pen.

155
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,800
The credit must be

156
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,240
attributed to Deputy Commander Xiao.

157
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,760
However,

158
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,320
in order to balance with other units,

159
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,960
the funds allocated this time

160
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,400
are still 2-3 million

161
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,120
shorts of the actual cost.

162
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,680
So, what should we do?

163
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,280
There’s no choice.

164
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,720
We’ll repair the road ourselves,

165
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,280
tighten our belts

166
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,280
to repair this readiness road.

167
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,840
The construction section of the Regiment 720

168
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,680
is the most dangerous terrain in the whole section,

169
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,120
but they have an amazing construction speed.

170
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,800
Especially the Ninth Company, can complete the most difficult task.

171
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,800
Extremely combative.

172
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,480
More than half of the equipment and materials for road construction

173
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,560
are in their place.

174
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,080
You remind them to take precautions in advance

175
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,120
and reinforce the wall behind the warehouse

176
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
to prevent mountain torrents.

177
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:12,950
Hurry up.

178
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,000
In addition,

179
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,040
the No. 3 National Defense Readiness Depot

180
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,240
is in their neighborhood.

181
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,280
You send Chen Dashan to ask

182
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,520
what they need us to do.

183
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,480
These are all the country’s readiness materials.

184
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:23,960
They are treasures

185
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:24,920
and should be protected.

186
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,520
Yes, Commander.

187
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,280
Notify the Regiment 720

188
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,240
to withdraw from the construction site immediately

189
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,760
to ensure the safety of officers and soldiers.

190
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,320
All attention!

191
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,240
Stop

192
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,200
and move back.

193
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,400
We can’t stop.

194
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,840
If the flow of water is too strong, the warehouse may be washed away.

195
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,030
Director Zhao,

196
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,840
there’s nothing I can do. Our superiors told us to withdraw.

197
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,320
I have to follow orders.

198
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,800
I…

199
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,320
Qin Hanyong.

200
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,240
Division Commander.

201
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,560
How is it going?

202
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,920
The roadbed has been reinforced.

203
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,920
All the materials

204
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,320
have been rescued to the safe place.

205
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,120
Division commander,

206
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,240
Commander Qin is helping us to reinforce the flood wall,

207
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,680
but they are going to withdraw now.

208
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,720
They cannot withdraw.

209
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,600
If they withdraw,

210
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,360
the No. 3 Readiness Depot will be destroyed.

211
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,840
Qin Hanyong,

212
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,640
this is country’s readiness depot.

213
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
It’s like fighting a war.

214
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,640
Can you withdraw when a war is being fought?

215
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
Now I order you to

216
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,400
send your men up there right now

217
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,440
and secure the No. 3 Readiness Depot.

218
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,240
Yes, Commander.

219
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,320
Gao Liang, come on.

220
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:12,960
Yes, Commander.

221
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,180
All of you

222
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,360
follow me.

223
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,520
Political Commissar,

224
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,240
how is it going?

225
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,800
The Division Commander is at the site of the Regiment 720,

226
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,800
leading them

227
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,200
to repair the flood wall of No. 3 Readiness Depot.

228
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,640
How about the other regiments?

229
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,840
Less than 10 minutes after

230
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,680
the Regiment 700 and Regiment 702 withdrew,

231
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,360
the construction site was flooded.

232
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,040
What?

233
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,160
Take care.

234
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:44,960
Chief,

235
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,320
go down, I’ll do it.

236
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,600
Don’t worry about me.

237
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:47,920
Hurry up.

238
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,840
Don’t mind me.

239
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,320
Hurry!

240
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,360
Go for it!

241
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,440
Don’t go.

242
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,960
Plug it up now!

243
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,000
Plug it up.

244
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
Chief, you go first.

245
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,360
Come on, do as I say.

246
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,360
Execute the command.

247
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:35,960
Come on.

248
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,400
Pull the Chief.

249
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,000
- Chief.
- Chief.

250
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,560
- Chief.
- Chief.

251
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:57,880
Chief.

252
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,560
Chief.

253
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,640
Hold him.

254
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,760
Chief.

255
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,080
Gao Liang.

256
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,280
Gao Liang.

[ICU]

259
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,040
Any of the chief’s family members here?

260
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,600
It’s me.

261
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,280
I am.

262
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,240
Doctor.

263
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,200
I’m the political commissar.

264
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,760
Let me know what’s going on.

265
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,360
Chief’s internal organs were severely impacted,

266
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,200
the old injury recurred,

267
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,440
and the rescue was not timely.

268
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,000
The director

269
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,360
has asked to be reported critically ill.

270
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,850
Chief,

271
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,720
don’t pull me.

272
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,830
Chief is critically ill, why are you pulling me?

273
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,960
It’s my fault for not catching chief.

274
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,040
Calm down, Gao Liang.

275
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:00,720
Gao Liang.

276
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,440
We have to find a way to get the division commander back.

277
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,160
I can drain my blood.

278
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,080

Hurry up!

282

How is he?

283

Still in the coma.

Dad, can you hear me?

290
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,360
Dad, you have to promise me that

291
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,640
you can’t just lie there and ignore me.

292

You can’t go away

293

for 18 years as before.

294
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,120
Dad, I’ll do as you say.

295
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,360
You can transfer me away.

00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,160
down to below sixty.

- Dad.

Wake up, daddy.

- Dad, don’t scare me.
- Electric shocks.

Dad.

315
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,160
Doctor Zhang, wait a minute.

00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,480
- Seems to have regained vital signs.
- Dad.

[Outpatient Building]

319
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,960
Nanzheng,

320
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,120
I’m telling you,

321
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,560
the mountain is so big that

322
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,920
you can’t see it clearly at night.

323
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,640
I can’t find him anywhere.

324
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,840
And then when I finally saw chief,

325
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,760
and I pulled him out.

326
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,600
I don’t know how long it took.

327
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,160
To me,

328
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,880
chief is usually a division commander,

329
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,720
sometimes he’s like my father.

330
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,040
He’s not only my father,

331
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,480
I think our division commander

332
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,320
is the father of all soldiers.

333
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,840
He is too tired every day.

and making battle plans.

336
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,040
Sometimes he was in a daze.

337
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,080
I brought him water to wash at night.

338
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,760
I saw him busy all the time,

339
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,000
and I didn’t disturb him.

340
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,600
In the end, I was so sleepy that

341
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,160
I sat at the door and fell asleep.

[Henry Norman Bethune]

343
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,240
When I woke up,

344
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,760
I saw chief,

345
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,920
all alone in the yard,

346
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,440
and the sight of his back

347
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,440
was poignant.

00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
He wrote a bunch of letters,

352

and your name

353
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,280

355
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,680
after chief was rescued,

356
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,480
he said one thing to me.

357
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,000
He asked me not to tell you,

358

384
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:58,880

385
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,800
What’s up, Chief?

386
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,720
What’s up, dad?

387
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,680
What are you doing standing there?

388
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,800
Help me.

389
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,680
Yes, Chief.

390
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,920
Dad, do you want to take a leak?

391
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,800
Let me help you.

392
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,520
How can you help?

393
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,360
You can't help, and you don’t know how.

394
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,360
Okay, Chief, come on.

395
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,000
Go out.

396
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:19,960
Chief is nervous.

397
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,040
I’ll go out.

398
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,960
Okay, fine.

399
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,680
Close the door.

400
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,400
Okay, Chief.

401
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:37,800
One, two, three, four.

403
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,280

404
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,720
Well, that’s not cool.

405
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,560
Look at you.

406
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,210
How do you let me live

407
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,480
without a daughter?

408
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,920
I can’t help you.

409
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,360
We are blessed, anyway.

410
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,080
You are recovering well.

411
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,720
Look at your glowing face,

412
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,080
don’t even look like someone who just got out of the hospital.

413
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,160

414
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,200

00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,480
out of us.

416
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,280
You recovered too suddenly.

417
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,560
It’s like a joke.

418
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,600
What do you mean?

419
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,600
Political Commissar.

420
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,520

423
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,120
Don’t you realize it?

426
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,480
Lunch break is almost over,

427
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,640
I have to go back.

428
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,600
Okay, fine.

429
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,720
I’m leaving, dad.

430
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,800
The transfer order of the political department of the military district has been approved,

431
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,200
and it is necessary to transfer Jiang Nanzheng

432
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,520
to the military district art troupe.

433
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,360
Colonel Ge said that

434
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,360
they had already inspected Jiang Nanzheng

435
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,520
and believed that her voice was good

436
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,200
and

437
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,360
her professional basis was solid.

438
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,320
The transfer order was sent half a month ago,

439
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,640
and now, since it’s a long way,

440
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,160
it came to us

441
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,880
today.

442
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,080
Colonel Ge has called more than once.

443
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,360
Political commissar,

444
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,160
they are transferring Nanzheng

445
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,400
to be an actress?

446
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:11,870
Yeah.

447
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,520
Division’s

448
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,640
art troupe wants her,

449
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,390
we

450
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,080
have to support it.

451
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,160
After all,

452
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,160
cultural and art work is also

453
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,670
an important part of military’s

454
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,960
ideological and political work.

455
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,400
Zheng, what do you think?

456
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,320
That’s right.

457
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,480
Well, I see you’ve recovered pretty well,

458
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,190
so,

459
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,560
in these two days,

460
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,600
you father and daughter can get together well.

461
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,000
After all the procedures are complete,

462
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,440
next week at most,

463
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,840
she’ll go there to check in.

464
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,360
Alright.

465
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,680
That’s it, I’ll go now.

466
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:42,920
See you, political commissar.

467
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,520
Alright, see you.

468
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,520

469
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:56,920
Here.

470
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,320
Go,

471
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,960
get some good liquor.

472
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,840
Make up for what I owed the political commissar last time.

[One Yuan]

474
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,200
But this is not enough.

475
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,640
Then borrow some from the political commissar.

476
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:16,960
From political commissar?

477
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,640
So stingy…

478
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,640

479
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,280
This is Zheng Yuan.

480
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:26,720
Hello.

481
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,200
Last time your art troupe came to our troop

482
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,680
and performed that show, Fire,

483
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,720
it was very impressive.

484
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,240
It’s like we had

485
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,840
the political study for three months.

486
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,480
All the community-level soldiers like it very much.

487
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,840
Not worthy mentioning.

488
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,360

489
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,000
Here’s the thing, Colonel Ge,

490
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,400
I have a soldier here,

491
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,600
and I looked into her files.

492
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,800
She has great quality,

493
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,280
sings well,

494
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,880
dances well,

495
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,680
and her family are all in music.

496
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,280

497
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,760
you can look into her.

Two bottles of liquor.

501
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,080
I need something with great quality.

502
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,600
Well, that’s tough,

503
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,800
quality liquor is hard to get now.

504
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,520
I’ll think about it.

505

The division commander’s business is my business.

506
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:24,760
Don’t worry.

507
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,440
No, no, no,

508
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,480
I didn’t say anything about the division commander,

509
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,480
you said it yourself.

510
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,920
You can’t make it special.

511
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,480
I won’t get it. I’m going.

513
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,640
- Don’t go.
- No, no.

514
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,800
Listen to me, the division commander told me

515
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,320
that you can skip meals, or skip liquors,

516
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,320
but you can’t owe others. Owing someone is a big problem.

517
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,640
I really won’t get anything.

518
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:40,720

00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,160
I just hope to become a cadre this year.

574
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,400
Now getting promotions for soldiers are becoming more and more difficult.

575
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,040
My age

576
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,680
is getting older and older too.

577
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,240
The last chance.

578
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,840
Your dear brother…

579
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,360
You are around the chief.

581
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,400
If you can,

582
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,640
please help me.

585
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,560
Little Wangcheng,

586
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,560
do you think

587
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,200
Lei Feng had made any mistake?

588
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,160
You are not up to something bad,

589
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,440
and making an excuse for yourself, are you?

590
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,360
No, no!

591
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,200
I’m telling you Gao Liang.

592
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,840
You are different now.

593
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,400
You are division commander’s public servant.

594
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,720
All eyes in the division

595
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,680
are on you.

596
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,080
Remember,

597
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,680
don’t be hot blooded.

600
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,960
Let’s get to the next topic.

601
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,520
Let’s discuss the list of soldiers’ getting promotion

602
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,040
from the cadre section.

603
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,680
Let’s see if you have any things to say.

604
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,080
The lists have already given to you.

605
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,520
Why isn’t Zhang Fei from Regiment 720 on the list?

606
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,560
Qin Hanyong told me

607
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,040
Zhang Fei

608
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,620
was the first on the list of promoted soldiers,

609
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,680
why isn’t he on this list?

610
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,580
Here’s the thing,

611
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,760
this time,

612
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,160
the places for soldiers’ promotion

613
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,960
are really few.

614
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,200
Zhangfei,

615
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,570
in Regiment 720,

616
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,200
is very outstanding.

617
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,400
But

618
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,400
among the whole division,

619
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:06,400
especially his

620
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,440
meritorious, awards,

621
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,810
and education background, age,

622
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,840
these solid conditions

623
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,280
compared to other soldiers in competition

624
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,800
are really at disadvantage.

625
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,560
Is that really the case?

626
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,080
Division commander,

627
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,480
we’ve investigated it,

628
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,640
that is the real situation.

629
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,280
Hello,

630
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,160
I’m the Deputy Section Chief Wu Jianwen of the cadre section.

631
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,120
The division commander is not here, huh?

632
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,000
He was inspecting the troops.

633
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,840
Chief Wu,

634
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,000
has the list of promoted soldiers

635
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,960
been out yet?

636
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,280
Soldiers’ promotion is always strictly controlled.

637
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,400
A battle company

638
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,080
has to wait for years to get one place,

639
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,160
and it’s basically for volunteer soldiers

640
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,680
and long served cadres.

641
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,640
Did you want to know…

642
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,480
You don’t have to explain it to me.

643
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,600
I just want to know

644
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,200
whether You Qianjin from the division’s administration and registration section is

645
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,320
on the list.

646
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,280
You Qianjin…

647
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,680
Does he know the division commander?

648
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,600
Or,

649
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,680
does the division commander know him?

650
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,680
The division commander doesn’t know him.

651
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,760
I do.

652
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,160
I mean,

653
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:05,920
just,

654
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,160
if you can help,

655
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,320
please help him.

656
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,240
After the investigation above,

657
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,480
it is proved

658
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,760
that during the process of soldiers’ promotion,

659
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,120
there really exists

660
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,160
serious disciplinary problems.

661
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,760
I took him here for you.

662
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,160
You take care.

663
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,200
Wang Tianming!

664
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,040
Don’t always do my job.

665
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,120
If I used the toilet, would you flush it for me too?

666
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,600
You dumby!

667
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,240
Ungrateful.

668
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,200
Stand straight!

669
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,720
I’m telling you!

670
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,240
That You Qianjin took full responsibility.

671
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,040
He said

672
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,280
this has nothing to do with you.

673
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,520
Chief,

674
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,360
he’s actually

675
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,640
kind of buddy great-hearted.

676
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,520
Great-hearted?

677
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,440
I didn’t see that.

678
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,640
He’s a recidivist.

679
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,680
He used to be the cook.

680
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,560
He was getting all comfortable

681
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,800
in the guest house doing nothing.

682
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,040
It’s him

683
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,840
that took your old sergeant’s

684
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,080
promotion place.

685
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,080
Do you know?

686
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,080
Chief,

687
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,120
actually,

688
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,280
I actually helped him

689
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,240
because he told me that

690
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,880
he’s one of the comrades of Gao Shan.

691
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,160
He just met Gao Shan once

692
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,840
together with over a thousand other comrades in the regiment.

693
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,880
How would you know that they knew each other?

694
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,480
They did.

695
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,520
He was on good terms with my brother.

696
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,800
He even showed me their picture.

697
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,320
I’ve investigated on it.

698
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,760
He’s Guan Zili,

699
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,040
who has transferred to civilian work,

700
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,200
instead of You Qianjin.

701
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,520
He fooled me!

702
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,880
Did you lie to Wu Jianwen as well?

703
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,800
I did not lie to him. I just...

704
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,640
told him to

705
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,040
give a hand when possible.

706
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,840
He thought that he was so clever.

707
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,480
Your attitude is on behalf of mine.

708
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,800
What have you done?

709
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,480
Is that your so-called wisdom?

710
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,280
Chief,

711
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,320
I understand now.

712
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,200
I’ll not be fooled again.

713
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,640
You’ll never be fooled

714
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,360
as long as

715
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,040
you stick to principles

716
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,200
and behave yourself,

717
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,240
understand?

718
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:00,840
Yes sir.

719
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,320
Did you bring your notebook?

720
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,000
Confiscated when I was grounded.

721
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,520
Then keep it in mind.

722
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:09,800
Yes.

723
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,680
I’ve looked into it.

724
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,320
The two bottles of wine you drank

725
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,560
were plonk, but filled

726
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,550
into the bottles of nice wine.

727
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:19,860
You pay him back

728
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,040
the two bottles of plonk,

729
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,520
and then the whole thing is over.

730
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,040
Yes sir.

731
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,280
I pay for

732
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,440
these two bottles of wine,

733
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,280
as a lesson learned.

734
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,520
My expectation for you

735
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,040
is having a bright future.

736
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,880
This lesson is learned

737
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,280
in fairly reasonable price.

738
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,560
Chief.

739
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,280
Smell it.

740
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,720
Can you smell it?

741
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,720
What a nice-smelling lesson.

742
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,400
Chief,

743
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,400
I have a question.

744
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,400
Don’t know whether I should ask.

745
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,440
If that’s about the wine,

746
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:09,760
then go ahead.

747
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:10,960
Chief,

748
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,800
how come this smell

749
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,080
is the same as the plonk?

750
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,360
Nonsense!

751
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,480
How stupid do you think I am?

752
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,120
Jiang Nanzheng is coming for lunch tomorrow.

753
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,680
Do we need more wine?

754
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:28,880
Yes sir.

755
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,120
What did I say?

756
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,680
You meant soup only. No more wine.

757
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,720
Get out!

758
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,520
Yes sir.

759
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,580
[Raise vigilance, defend the motherland]

760
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,240
Go!

761
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,080
Jiang Nanzheng.

762
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,200
After failing in the maneuver,

763
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,840
I’ve locked

764
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,240
my heart away,

765
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,240
and did nothing

766
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,640
but training.

767
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,400
Just as what I said to my father,

768
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,440
I forge myself

769
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,520
for my dreams.

770
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,080
Other than that,

771
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,180
[Carry every red flag.]

772
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,120
nothing else matters.

773
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,160
Jiang Nanzheng,

774
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,000
wish you all the best.

775
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,370
Chief.

776
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,480
Jiang Nanzheng

777
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,080
has always loved singing and dancing since her childhood.

778
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,560
Being recruited into the art troupe

779
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,920
is a dream come true.

780
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,120
Congratulations!

781
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,360
Thanks!

782
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,640
How do you know my childhood hobbies?

783
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,440
I’m just guessing.

784
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,080
Didn’t they give you assessments?

785
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,600
Yeah, they did.

786
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,680
Actually,

787
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,360
I was extremely nervous

788
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,520
facing a row of supervisors.

789
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,240
They asked me to perform

790
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,440
two songs and one dance.

791
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,680
I think that

792
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,720
I did okay.

793
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,780
It seems that the examination of art troupe

794
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,340
is much more difficult than college entrance examination, chief.

795
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,150
That depends on

796
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:15,120
whose daughter she is.

797
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,670
Come on.

798
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,120
Have some more.

799
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,800
Eat more meat.

800
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,760
Thanks, chief.

801
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,230
Thanks, dad.

802
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,520
Go ahead and eat.

803
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,040
That’s okay. Thanks.

804
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,360
Gao Liang,

805
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,670
you risked your life to save mine.

806
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,600
With the soup, on behalf of wine,

807
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,600
I thanked you for saving my life.

808
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,280
Here.

809
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,080
Chief!

810
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:39,840
Sit down.

811
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,340
[Carry every red flag.]

812
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,160
Sergeant.

813
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,400
Come on. Stop it.

814
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,080
Let me do it for you.

815
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,360
I’ll wash it myself.

816
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,800
You can wash mine

817
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,920
upon recovery.

818
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:47,560
Sergeant,

819
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,720
something’s wrong.

820
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,080
What?

821
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,040
What’s wrong?

822
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,240
Anything wrong?

823
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,560
Yiye,

824
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,880
are we bros?

825
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,960
As my bro,

826
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,640
you have to do me a favor.

827
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:06,840
What favor?

828
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,560
I got promoted.

829
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,000
Sergeant!

830
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,760
That’s great!

831
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,480
How about that?

832
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,560
I’ll call up the guys and get together for a drink.

833
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:20,520
Yes.

834
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,840
That’s for sure.

835
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,440
But the major problem now

836
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,640
is that I am badly in need of

837
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,760
a dress.

838
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,480
A dress?

839
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,560
A red dress.

840
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,960
A stylish dress.

841
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,600
You’ll buy me one.

842
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,320
What?

843
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,200
See, I got promoted.

844
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,720
And I promised Xiu

845
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,920
to marry her

846
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,200
after being a platoon leader.

847
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,760
No, sergeant.

848
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,000
No, platoon leader.

849
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:51,960
Now,

850
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,680
let me get this straight.

851
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,200
You need a red dress.

852
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:56,640
Yes.

853
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,800
And you need it for Xiu in your wedding.

854
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,240
That’s right.

855
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,200
And I’ll buy this dress for you, right?

856
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,600
Right.

857
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:05,920
You...

858
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,040
How should I put it?

859
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:08,960
Just that...

860
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,040
You...

861
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:10,760
You are highly educated,

862
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,480
what’s the word?

863
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,160
Aesthetic.

864
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,320
Aesthetic.

865
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,200
You have the aesthetic judgement.

866
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,320
You are literate, well-educated

867
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,760
and will definitely buy a nicer dress than I do.

868
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,120
No, platoon leader.

869
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,080
This may not be appropriate.

870
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,120
Let alone the fact that I’m a soldier and you’re a platoon leader,

871
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,400
you should never assign me this kind of task

872
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,880
even if I were the university professor.

873
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,280
Xiu is your wife.

874
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,240
You’re her husband.

875
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,160
You can buy her anything

876
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,920
as her husband.

877
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,640
But what about me?

878
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,320
That’s inappropriate.

879
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,680
What’s wrong with it?

880
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,980
I want to give her the best.

881
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,660
And the dress you choose will be the best.

882
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,140
It doesn’t matter

883
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,020
who buys it,

884
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:55,740
right?

885
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:56,860
Platoon leader,

886
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,260
you are all Xiu wants,

887
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,500
instead of something nice.

888
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,220
Understand?

889
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,220
No.

890
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,180
I thought that, simple as it is,

891
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,980
you would say yes without hesitation.

892
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,380
What a fuss

893
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,700
you made!

894
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,140
No wonder Gao Liang said that

895
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,220
he would marry you

896
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,860
if he were a girl.

897
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,500
You think too much.

898
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,380
Platoon leader,

899
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,260
girls do not expect you

900
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,700
to give her anything nice.

901
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,900
You need to look out for her,

902
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:24,820
be there for her.

903
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:26,980
Then...

904
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:29,420
Then...

905
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,580
What happened between you and Jiang?

906
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,500
Platoon leader,

907
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,580
don’t bring that up again.

908
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,880
I won’t.

909
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,460
Here’s what I am thinking.

910
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,300
I think that Xiu...

911
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,460
She...

912
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,500
She doesn’t expect for anything nice.

913
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:50,980
Whatever from me is fine.

914
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,500
It means that she loves me.

915
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:53,980
As for me,

916
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,140
I want to give her everything nice.

917
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,700
Whoever buys it is fine.

918
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,180
What does it mean?

919
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,460
It means I love her, right?

920
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:13,580
Platoon leader.

921
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,140
Alright, how about this?

922
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,500
I’ll help you.

923
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,140
You may rest assured.

924
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,420
I’ll not let you down.

925
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,580
Chief.

926
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,220
Comrade Jiang Nanzheng.

927
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,100
Now that chief is here,

928
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,660
I would like to take this opportunity,

929
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:29,860
and say something.

930
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,060
Comrade Jiang Nanzheng,

931
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,580
you’re the best comrade,

932
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,460
female comrade,

933
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:38,540
I have ever had

934
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,540
since I joined the army.

935
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,380
Here’s to you.

936
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,460
Gao Liang.

937
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,140
You’ve been so good to me

938
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,740
from Zhuangmu to division headquarter.

939
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,580
You’re not only my comrade,

940
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,980
but also my best friend.

941
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,660
You will always be my comrade

942
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,260
after I go to the art troupe.

943
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,020
And you will be my best friend for a lifetime.

944
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:58,740
Come on.

945
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,380
Here’s to you.

946
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,140
Okay.

947
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,020
Comrade Jiang Nanzheng.

948
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:14,740
Yes sir.

949
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,220
All of us here

950
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,100
want to

951
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,980
listen to a song

952
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,540
from the comrade from art troupe.

953
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:23,580
Yeah.

954
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,700
That’s right.

955
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:43,380
♫ Your shadow, your voice ♫

966
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,380
Chief,

967
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,140
I have something in my eyes.

968
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,020
I’m going out.

969
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,260
Zheng.

970
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,060
Go check it out.

971
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,780
What’s matter?

972
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,260
Are you crying?

973
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,340
No.

974
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,260
Who’s crying?

975
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:10,770
I’m just

976
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,140
happy for you.

977
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,900
Aren’t you crying?

978
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,860
This is happy tears.

979
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,180
Is this happy?

980
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:24,900
Come on, take a look.

981
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:25,660
No.

982
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,500
Just take a look.

983
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,580
Look at you.

984
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,140
No.

985
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:34,960
What?

986
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,140
You don’t want me to go to the art troupe, do you?

987
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,220
I can’t finish my words just now

988
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,860
with division commander there.

989
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:45,700
You’ve always been my best comrade

990
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,740
from Zhangmu

991
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,420
to division headquarter.

992
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,460
We were climbing walls,

993
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,340
hiding from provost together

994
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,500
to avoid being overseed.

995
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,220
But from now on,

996
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,860
I can only see you

997
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,940
in the performance as an audience.
