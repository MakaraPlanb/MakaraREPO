1
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:45,080
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:37,960
Who's there?

3
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,840
That's the provost.

4
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,200
It was there moments ago.

5
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,759
Where did it go?

6
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,479
I see you.

7
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,560
Let's go.

8
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,120
Are you trying to take advantage of me?

9
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,230
What?

10
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,440
How can you not tell my intention

11
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,160
with the big eyes of yours?

12
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,640
Then why are you staying so close to me?

13
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,560
I'm not close to you.

14
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,440
Go away.

15
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,840
Stay far from me.

16
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,400
How far?

17
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,440
Let's be precise and give me a number.

18
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,240
The appropriate distance between comrade-in-arms.

19
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,720
Don't you mess with me.

20
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,760
And how much is that?

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
20 cm.

22
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,000
Turn around and don't look at me.

23
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,480
Is that enough?

24
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,800
No, go further.

25
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,079
I'm gonna hit the stone.

26
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:37,960
Just go.

27
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,320
You happy?

28
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,720
Comrade Jiang Nanzheng.

29
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,320
That's not the appropriate distance

30
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,120
between comrade-in-arms.

31
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,000
This

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,840
is too close.

33
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,200
That's too much.

34
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,640
Too much.

35
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,000
Don't be so initiative.

36
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,560
A boar.

37
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,560
Stop this.

38
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,960
You're strangling me.

39
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,720
It's going this way.

40
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,720
Keep quiet.

41
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,840
Get out.

42
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,280
I see you.

43
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,079
Sergeant.

44
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,200
There's a boar.

45
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,110
Let's hurry.

46
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,280
Go get people and get that boar.

47
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,040
You're killing me.

48
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,520
That's close.

49
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,960
How did you know they're still there?

50
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,780
That nerd Gu Yiye is a bookworm.

51
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,060
It's my special ability.

52
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,180
What ability?

53
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,019
I can see better

54
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,579
if it's dark.

55
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:21,339
I've got night vision.

56
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:23,540
I picked it up when I was working in the mine.

57
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,820
I can see you going this way before.

58
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:26,980
So you stalked me?

59
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,300
I didn't stalk you.

60
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,140
I just

61
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,780
wanna apologize for what happened in the afternoon.

62
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,860
I saw you slacking off by yourself.

63
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,860
I'm not slacking off.

64
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,100
Just watching stars.

65
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,020
I know.

66
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,300
Fluttering is the flag and the world is red,

67
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,140
Heavenward we gaze up and see The glaring Plough.

68
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,940
Where's the Plough?

69
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,780
Look.

70
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:47,940
It's there.

71
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,940
Did you ask for a leave?

72
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,060
I did.

73
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,420
So did I.

74
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,420
A bathroom break.

75
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,380
Gao Liang.

76
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,820
This might be my imagination but,

77
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,860
Do you have a crush on me?

78
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,820
What are you...

79
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,140
I mean

80
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,260
now that you've asked,

81
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,140
it's possible.

82
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:16,820
Gao Liang.

83
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,980
I don't want you to misunderstand.

84
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,940
I take you as a brother.

85
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,540
I like you.

86
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,900
But not that kind of like.

87
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,580
And we are new recruits.

88
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,340
We can't have that affection, right?

89
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,260
Don't overthink.

90
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,060
Jiang Nanzheng.

91
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,420
Let me ask you a question.

92
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:40,620
Why

93
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,340
are you always here

94
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,080
looking at the plants and the stars?

95
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,659
I'd love to chat, Gao Liang,

96
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,060
but it's getting late.

97
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,020
Let's report back.

98
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,820
The provost is coming soon.

99
00:05:59,260 --> 00:05:59,780
Bye.

100
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,500
Go back.

101
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:06,620
Brother.

102
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,500
I have a secret for you.

103
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,620
In this world,

104
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,860
other than you,

105
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,340
There's one more soul I admire,

106
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,860
or,

107
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,620
like,

108
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,140
or,

109
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,860
one that I wanna love for the rest of my life.

110
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,860
I don't know why.

111
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,380
But I feel

112
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,140
that I have so much to expect in the military.

113
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,220
I wanna perfect myself.

114
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,540
Better than Gu Yiye.

115
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,500
Anyone can't run

116
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,460
go over there and plank!

117
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,659
All the way to the end of the exercise!

118
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,100
Speed up!

119
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,340
Speed up!

120
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,210
Come on!

121
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,100
Move!

122
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,100
Don't think about the goal.

123
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,580
Just remember the direction.

124
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,840
So you can keep running.

125
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,460
[Training ground]

126
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,340
Move up!

127
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,380
Sergeant of 9th squad.

128
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,540
Yes sir.

129
00:06:59,180 --> 00:06:59,820
All rise.

130
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,820
Comrade provost.

131
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,060
8 out of 11 men of 9th squad of new recruit

132
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,140
reporting for duty.

133
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,420
Three are absent for mission.

134
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,620
Others are

135
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,020
performing cleaning duty.

136
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:14,740
Please give orders.

137
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,500
Take out all your liberation shoes.

138
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,340
Liberation shoes?

139
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,860
Don't be scared, Niu Mancang.

140
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,940
It's okay to have smelly feet.

141
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,060
You don't get punishment for that.

142
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,420
Comrade provost.

143
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,980
May I ask

144
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,140
why you check our liberation shoes?

145
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,180
Last night we were on duty at the barrack site,

146
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,500
and we spotted someone sneaking out

147
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,540
from a fracture of the wall.

148
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,220
We checked the bushes outside the fracture,

149
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,820
and found footprints of two military shoes.

150
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,100
Two footprints.

151
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,500
A male,

152
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,700
And a female.

153
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,780
Why did you wash your shoe?

154
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,540
Sir,

155
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,620
my shoes were dirty.

156
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,700
Why were they dirty?

157
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:08,740
I stepped on some shit, sir.

158
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,940
Where did you step on shit,

159
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,540
and whose shit was that?

160
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,180
Sir,

161
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,860
all that I know is I stepped on shit,

162
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,380
and I really don't know whose it was.

163
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,340
We found lots of cinders refilled

164
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,700
at the site of footprints,

165
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,660
which means

166
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,980
we are looking for someone

167
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,900
either with cinders on his shoe,

168
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:30,940
or,

169
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,419
washed his shoes for no reason.

170
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:35,460
I'm asking you again,

171
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,260
why did you wash your shoes?

172
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:39,980
Let me show you.

173
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,460
You can check it out yourself.

174
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:52,660
No way.

175
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,460
How is this stinkier than Niu Mancang's feet?

176
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,120
I...

177
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,640
We had running exercise yesterday,

178
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,980
and I was the last.

179
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,940
So the company commander ordered me

180
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,020
to fertilize the vegetable garden.

181
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,500
I wasn't careful enough when I load the fertilizer,

182
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,860
and stepped in the pit.

183
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,820
I brushed my shoes twice when I was back,

184
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,460
and it still stinks.

185
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,460
There was really no time for the sock,

186
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,940
so I put it away in the box

187
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,260
to not contaminate the barrack.

188
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,700
Let's go.

189
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:33,740
[Military service]

190
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,810
Next is the contribution from the 23rd company of our regiment:

191
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,260
Doing our own jobs well

192
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,110
is an enhancement to our fighting capacity.

193
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,970
The soldiers from the 3rd squad, 1st platoon of our company...

194
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,140
Sergeant Han.

195
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,260
What are you doing?

196
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:41,980
Let's keep this a secret.

197
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,300
I wanna ask something.

198
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,460
Now you are aware?

199
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,380
I'll be honest.

200
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,780
The provost took Jiang Nanzheng away.

201
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,860
Pray to the heaven

202
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,980
that she doesn't give you away.

203
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,980
Don't scare me.

204
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,020
I know that you may be harsh on the outside,

205
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,380
but you have a good heart.

206
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,140
What exactly happened?

207
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,940
So you must be the male one.

208
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,620
Why are you new recruits

209
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,340
always mess up?

210
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,780
The provost was here last night,

211
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,060
inspecting everyone's shoes

212
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,580
for cinders.

213
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,140
So,

214
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:17,940
did he find out?

215
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,700
What do you think?

216
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,300
Please tell me, Han.

217
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,780
We're from the same village.

218
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,180
You are the one I trust the most in the military.

219
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,420
Please tell me the truth.

220
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,660
I noticed something's wrong,

221
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,660
and I said they were my shoes.

222
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,620
The girl almost got into trouble.

223
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:36,980
And,

224
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,060
Did they do anything to you?

225
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,580
Good of you to ask.

226
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,500
I was on duty last night,

227
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,580
and there's nothing they can say about that.

228
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,700
Good, good.

229
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:49,860
I'm just worried

230
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,740
that you may get involved in this.

231
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,020
Oh, shut up.

232
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,620
But I have to warn you.

233
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,900
The provost is being too precise.

234
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,740
I'm guessing there's a snitch.

235
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,260
Be careful out there.

236
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,140
Don't be told on.

237
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:01,900
Alright.

238
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,380
Now hurry up and get back.

239
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,020
Sergeant Han,

240
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,900
You are so pretty even when giving lessons.

241
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,340
Shut up.

242
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,420
Just leave.

243
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,540
Ok.

244
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,220
The provost is being too precise.

245
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,820
I'm guessing there's a snitch.

246
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,460
Be careful out there.

247
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,260
Don't be told on.

248
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,380
Niu Mancang.

249
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,660
You got a partner?

250
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,780
Nope.

251
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,100
No?

252
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:33,900
I'm gonna practice with you.

253
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,220
Gao,

254
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,860
What's going on?

255
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,500
I'm a bit scared.

256
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,260
Come on, there's nothing to be afraid of.

257
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,260
You're like a female soldier.

258
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,060
Put on.

259
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:49,500
[Take root]

260
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,900
Niu.

261
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,540
You brought the provost, right?

262
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,300
Don't move.

263
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,700
Gao.

264
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,220
It's not me.

265
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,620
Not you?

266
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,100
If no one snitched,

267
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,500
why would the provost come to our squad?

268
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,180
And only targeted me.

269
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,620
All gatherings!

270
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,300
Bayonet charging,

271
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,740
is an important means of wiping out the enemy
in close combat.

272
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,300
It wins in technique

273
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,860
and even more in momentum.

274
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,460
We should carry forward

275
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,780
our army's heroic spirit of
overwhelming all enemies,

276
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,300
learn the basic movements of
bayonet charging,

277
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,060
master the skills of bayonet charging

278
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,260
under various circumstances,

279
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,060
and cultivate our

280
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,420
brave and indomitable fighting style

281
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,900
in the course of training.

282
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,380
All groups prepare!

283
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,900
Gao, be merciful, okay?

284
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,500
How can a peasant be afraid of a bayonet fight?

285
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,460
Your rival is over there!

286
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,100
Go!

287
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,100
All right, Gao.

288
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:06,940
Listen to me.

289
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,460
I didn't do that.

290
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,900
Believe me, please, Gao.

291
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,020
Don't worry.

292
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,020
I'm not gonna stab you.

293
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,220
The attack is not fast enough,

294
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,460
nor accurate enough!

295
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,100
You should attack harder!

296
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,580
Charge! Charge! Charge!

297
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:26,660
Go on!

298
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,780
Niu Mancang.

299
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,500
Sergeant, I'm fine.

300
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,820
- Is that your so-called “fine”?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

301
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,620
Zhang Fei.

302
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,860
Get him to the health station now.

303
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,660
What are you waiting for?

304
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,420
Come and carry him.

305
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,340
Gao.

306
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,260
The rest of you, keep training.

307
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,260
Gao, believe me, please.

308
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,740
[Loyalty, excellence, knowledge, sincere, unity, innovation, strictness, truth]

309
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,660
I didn't say that.

310
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,940
Put me down, Gao.

311
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,620
Put me down.

312
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,380
Don't move.

313
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,140
Let me down.

314
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,540
What are you doing?

315
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,700
Sergeant,

316
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,620
I have something to say.

317
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,700
Say it.

318
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,980
Go ahead.

319
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:17,900
Gao,

320
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,020
believe me,

321
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,420
I didn't say anything.

322
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,780
The company soldier

323
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,820
with the provost,
came over and questioned me.

324
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,180
They told me that

325
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,140
if I covered up others,

326
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,380
I would be punished.

327
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,860
I was scared

328
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,740
and I wanted to say something,

329
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,260
but I didn't.

330
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,860
I didn't say anything.

331
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,220
You have to believe me.

332
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,020
The sergeant can testify for me.

333
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,300
Gao,

334
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,060
say something!

335
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,580
Say something!

336
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,500
Don't you believe me yet?

337
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,220
What else to say?

338
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,340
Why don't you believe me?

339
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,220
What do you suspect me of?

340
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:03,900
Brother,

341
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,180
Niu is my best comrade in the army.

342
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,020
I should never have doubted my comrades.

343
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,020
I feel guilty.

344
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,820
I know the feeling.

345
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,060
I've always

346
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,980
felt this kind of guilt about you.

347
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,100
I can't make the same mistake again.

348
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,660
I'll take a chance

349
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,540
and tell him

350
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,580
I'm sorry.

351
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,500
Let me dry it for you, Niu.

352
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,020
Help me tighten.

353
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,460
Okay.

354
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,900
Did you use half a bag of laundry detergent?
It smells so good.

355
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,820
I just want to clean it up.

356
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,540
Sure, you can use it. Go ahead.

357
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,220
Come on.

358
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,900
Don't be like this.

359
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,420
You've apologized three times.

360
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:57,900
Gao,

361
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,180
May I make a request of you?

362
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,020
We're brothers, so feel free to say anything.

363
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,220
Just say it.

364
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,460
Lend me your watch.

365
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,700
The watch. Lend me that watch!

366
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,940
Don't say you don't have one!

367
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:15,980
I've seen it.

368
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,900
Every time the lights go out,

369
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,540
you take the watch out from
under your pillow.

370
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,020
That dial is so bright!

371
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,380
Niu, the company has just finished

372
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,420
the ideological education class.

373
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,980
We must oppose money worship, right.

374
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,660
And hedonism and extreme individualism.

375
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,140
The company is not allowed to wear a watch,

376
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,140
what do you need it for?

377
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,380
I don't want to take your watch.

378
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,980
Every time I stand guard,

379
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,100
the last shift is

380
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,100
always an hour early to call me up.

381
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,540

I asked Gu Yiye to do me a favor.

540

When he was 8,

548
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:50,960
he took me home,

549
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,860
and raised me as his own brother.

he got promotion,

552
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,500
and the parents thought

553
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,780
they should save money and get my brother a Shanghai watch.

554
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,340

555
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,100
that I can wear it for 3 days when the watch comes.

556
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,980
I was so happy.

00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,220
In our village, if I owned a Shanghai watch,

558
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,180

560
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,100

561
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:21,980
And everyday,

562
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,420
day after night,

563
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,620
my brother finally came back.

564
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,900
But he didn't bring anything with him.

565
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,980
I was so angry

566
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:35,850
that I didn't talk to him.

567
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,460
Later I found out

568
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,340
that when my brother went in town to buy the watch

569
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,820
he met a fellow-townsman.

570
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,660
That man's child was severely ill,

571
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,140
he was in town taking his child to hospital.

572
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,220
But their money got stolen.

573
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,660
Then my brother gave all his money for the watch

574
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,340
to the fellow-townsman.

575
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,150
And after that

576
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,460
my brother had to go back to the troop.

577
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,500
I really didn't want him to leave,

578
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,420
but I didn't tell him.

579
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,940
The day before he went to the battle field,

580
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,980
his letter to my mom was saying

581
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,020
"tell Gao Liang don't be mad,

582
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,700
I'll definitely buy him a watch",

583
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,900
saying "ask him to talk to me,

584
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,500
when I got to the military,

585
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,420
tell him to write to me".

586
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,620
But I didn't write a word.

587
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,980
I didn't know he was not coming back.

588
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,780
My brother went away.

589
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,500
After some days,

590
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,340
two men from the military

591
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,620
came for my mom with my brother's remains.

592
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,540
After we opened the remains,

593
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,580
there was a Shanghai watch.

594
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,770
I saw it and knew that it wasn't my brother's.

595
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,940
And the two soldiers said,

596
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,860
they said my brother

597
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,220
was always thinking about me.

598
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,100
He always wanted to buy me that watch.

599
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,500
But he died on the battle field

600
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,780
before he could buy that watch.

601
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,980
The money for that Shanghai watch

602
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,900
is collected from his comrades in arms.

603
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,940
They bought it for me

604
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,220
to fulfill his last wish.

605
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,300
Then they took out

606
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,220
that smashed watch.

607
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,540
They said

608
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,500
that it was given to my brother from the military before he went to the battle field.

609
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,340
My brother was wearing this watch

610
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,100
when he died.

611
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,700
There's my brother's blood on it.

612
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:53,860
This watch,

613
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,180
its watch-face was smashed,

614
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,980
and all the hands were gone.

615
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,380
I stared at it and thought,

616
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,500
the time the hands were pointing

617
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,900
must be when my brother died.

618
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,700
I didn't know

619
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,780
when my brother died at last.

620
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,340
I didn't know when he passed away.

621
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,620
Was he really missing me and my mom.

622
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,140
Was he missing his younger brother,

623
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,860
thinking if he's still mad at him.

624
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:34,940
He didn't know,

625
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,720
I stopped being mad at him a long time ago.

00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,020
Don't worry. We will not fall.

755
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,700
Slow down.

756
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,140
Slow down.

757
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,500
Don't worry. The faster the safer.

758
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,020
Are you ok?

759
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,380
Yeah.

760
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,740
Gu Yiye.

761
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,400
Gu Yiye.

762
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,100
Gu Yiye, if you don't get up now,

763
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,380
I'll report to your sergeant.

764
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,340
Why are you here?

765
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,380
Take it.

766
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,460
I'm leaving.

767
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:31,780
Wait a minute.

768
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,820
What's this? Why do you drop it and leave?

769
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:35,660
Rat poison?

770
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,900
You're such ungrateful.

771
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,860
It's anti-fever medicine. Really effective.

772
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,700
Take three pills each day. Don't overdose it.

773
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,540
Are you ok?

774
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,660
Keep it down.

775
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,740
Yeah, I'm ok.

776
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,140
Just hurry back.

777
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,940
Don't get caught by your sergeant.

778
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,110
Or you'll be punished again.

779
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,440
Sergeant Han is not here today.

780
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,780
But this is the dormitory of male soldiers.

781
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,260
I just came here to give you the medicine,

782
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,420
and then I'll leave.

783
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,740
Are you some kind of hunting dog?

784
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:16,660
Gu Yiye,

785
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,460
I saw you.

786
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,620
Comrade Jiang, stand up.

787
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,900
Jiang, stand up.

788
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,220
I just go out to get the medicine.

789
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,100
How come you...

790
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,700
how come you are here?

791
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:36,940
Just...

792
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,780
He's sick. And then I ran into him, so...

793
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,020
just checking him out.

794
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,940
Who sent you here?

795
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,620
Since you're back, I'll leave now.

796
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,180
Stop, stop there.

797
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:50,140
Sergeant.

798
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,060
Sergeant, I feel dizzy.

799
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,580
Why are you here?

800
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,580
Sergeant, why are you...

801
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,980
I accidentally fell into the river

802
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,100
on my way back to the battalion.

803
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,620
Why didn't you take part in the training?

804
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:20,860
I...

805
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,500
I just came back to change my equipment.

806
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,220
And I got my period today.

807
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,540
So I came back to change.

808
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,220
Sergeant,

809
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,050
hurry up and change your clothes.

810
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,380
Don't catch cold.

811
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:51,780
[Learn from Lei Feng. Mao Zedong.]

812
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:51,740
No way.

813
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,180
I'm exhausted. Dead tired.

814
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,300
Gu Yiye.

815
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,140
Gu, you...

816
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,380
why are you lying in my bed?

817
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,700
My tidy bed...

818
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,500
Don't you have any mercy?

819
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,660
Gu's sick.

820
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,220
And it's Sergeant who permitted him to take a rest here.

821
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,100
But what about my bed?

822
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,620
Stop it, stop yelling.

823
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,700
I'll help you with it.

824
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,500
Check it out.

825
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,020
Check out the awareness of Vice Sergeant.

826
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,980
You are no match. You know that?

827
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,660
- You shut your mouth.
- What?

828
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,140
Here's our Sergeant!

829
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,100
Come on, Sergeant.

830
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,100
You be the judge.

831
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,420
See what Niu did just now.

832
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,660
Sergeant.

833
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,020
I'm here to report back from leave.

834
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,540
I'm worn out.

835
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,860
Here, notebooks.

836
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,220
Notebooks are wet. My clothes are wet.

837
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:33,900
Where did you go?

838
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,200
Learning from Lei Feng,

839
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,690
I helped an old lady go across the river.

840
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,610
Do you believe me?

841
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,100
If you said so.

842
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,980
Mule Gu, what happened?

843
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,380
Take extra practicing on your own,

844
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,640
and hurt yourself, right?

845
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,760
Do you want my massage?

846
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,140
Let me massage you, massage.

847
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,140
Gao Liang, he's sick.

848
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,300
What are you doing?

849
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:04,500
Yiye, has the fever gone?

850
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,100
What's this?

851
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:10,860
It's for smelly feet.

852
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:11,820
Take a few drops into the shoes,

853
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:12,780
and it'll cover the smell.

854
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,900
How many drops?

855
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:17,900
How many drops?

856
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,460
Ten drops for once.

857
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,380
Three times a day. Just like eating.

858
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,340
Don't forget it.

859
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,080
It's such a waste. How much is it?

860
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,100
It's none of your business.

861
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,660
Internal affair assessment is going to start soon.

862
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,020
We have to make sure that nothing goes wrong.

863
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,220
Understand?

864
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:36,620
[Be an outstanding soldier.]

865
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:34,940
Let's try to be fair

866
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:36,240
for all companies.

867
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,140
Chief Song,

868
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,150
isn't the internal affair assessment tomorrow?

869
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:43,030
What?

870
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,630
Surprise attack?

871
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:45,840
Don't you welcome us?

872
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,380
No, not at all.

873
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,910
I have to accompany with the chief from our headquarter.

874
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,470
Therefore, the assessment is moved to tonight.

875
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,620
The headquarter assigned a task

876
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,540
of gun tests.

877
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,540
Will our new recruit company have the chance?

878
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,420
Don't worry.

879
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,460
The thing is,

880
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,220
it's fair chance

881
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,900
for every new recruit.

882
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,260
And I can tell you for sure

883
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,100
that we will choose soldiers

884
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,580
on different levels for the test,

885
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,980
so as to test the difficulty of mastering new weapons.

886
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,260
That's our goal.

887
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,660
It means that our new recruits

888
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,700
have the chance to compete, right?

889
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:23,700
Of course.

890
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,900
This is an excellent policy.

891
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,500
Ok, don't show off.

892
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,620
The most important thing now

893
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,580
is the internal affair assessment of the regiment,

894
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,820
and achieve good scores on queueing.

895
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,300
Then there's a good chance.

896
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,220
Well noted.

897
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,140
Okay.

898
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:41,500
Show us the way.

899
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,420
Let's go.

900
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,900
[The 9th squad of new recruit]

901
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,380
Chief Song,

902
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,780
I know that you're here with a microscope.

903
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,620
We have worked even harder.

904
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:56,700
What do you think?

905
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,020
Is it okay?

906
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,140
That's good.

907
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,620
Next squad.

908
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:02,580
No.

909
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,420
Chief Song,

910
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,100
This is the ninth squad.

911
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,380
The next squad is the vegetable garden.

912
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,940
What about we go have a cup of tea in the company?

913
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,100
Let's go.

914
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,420
What?

915
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:33,460
Qin,

916
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:34,540
come here.

917
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,540
Don't bother.

918
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,860
I've smelled every bed.

919
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,420
This soldier has the most smelly feet.

920
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,460
We put a lot of efforts on it.

921
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,820
Not smelly at all, don't worry.

922
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,020
Come on, smell it.
