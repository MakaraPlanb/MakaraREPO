What’s up, Company Commander?

10
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,840
Looking at them,

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,840
it reminds me of the time when you were recruits.

12
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,520

Company Commander, don’t tease us.

26
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,320
Why am I teasing you?

27
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,400
It’s true.

28
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,800
This is all rather sudden.

29
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,640
I don’t know what to say.

30
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,680

00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,360
I don’t want to talk about the brothers.

But I can’t help it.

Thanks to Gao Liang,

59
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,240
I got a place in the exam.

60
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,480
He signed up for me

61
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,560
and had been busy all the time.

62
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,240
He kept encouraging me

63
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,640
before I entered the examination room.

64
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,880
What’s wrong with you?

65
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,520
It was supposed to be my boyfriend’s job,

66
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,320
and now he’s taken it.

67
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,520
You just say “hmm”.

68
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,400
I’ve been taking part in the Hero Model report Group,

69
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,800
and I don’t have time.

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,560
So, you’re not worried that

71
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,120
he’s being so nice to me, huh?

72
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,070
Okay.

73
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,440
Tell you the truth.

74
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,880
There are two main reasons

75
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,600
for this matter.

76
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,760
The first reason

77
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,280
is his warm heart.

78
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,400
The second reason

79
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,560
is that I asked him to help.

80
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,080
I learned the admissions policy from my dad in detail

81
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,920
and asked him to tell you.

82
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,920
No wonder.

83
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,040
No wonder he said to keep it a secret.

84
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,520
He just wants to show off for a few more days.

85
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,600
Why do you boys always do this?

86
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,880
Always says things in a roundabout way.

87
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,400
Nanzheng.

88
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,760
I feel sorry that

89
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,920
I can’t stay with you all the time.

90
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,680
So,

91
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,200
I asked Gao Liang for help.

92
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,920
Although he seems to be

93
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,440
cheeky all day long.

94
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,600
But every time I turn around,

95
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,160
he is standing in place,

96
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,320
being my powerful backing,

97
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,480
which is quite reassuring.

98
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,040
Especially after returning from the war,

99
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,480
I found that he suddenly grew up.

100
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,240
Unlike me,

101
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,080
I’m losing myself.

102
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,760
Don't worry.

103
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,640
It will get better gradually.

104
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,840
The person I like, Gu Yiye,

105
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,840
can do things that others cannot do.

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,880
Of course, he will also encounter troubles

107
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,200
that others cannot encounter.

108
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,320
But he’ll figure it out

109
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,600
and get out of the haze.

110
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,240
I grew up

111
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,560
without any good friends,

112
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,560
and never envied anyone.

113
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,320
But some time ago, I was thinking,

114
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,280
if Gu Yiye

115
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,800
is always so tired,

116
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,120
then I shouldn’t be Gu Yiye.

117
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,920
Wouldn't it be nice to

118
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,720
become Gao Liang?

119
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,440
Yiye,

120
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,159
you and Gao Liang are completely different people.

121
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,720
Gao Liang,

122
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,360
just like my family.

123
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,520
He’s a close and dear comrade of mine.

124
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,720
I remember when I was on the front line

125
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,800
and saw him coming back from the dead,

126
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,080
I cried.

127
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,720
At that moment, I was thinking that

128
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,800
I would never let him feel lonely again.

129
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,400
Have you told him about these words?

130
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,480
If he heard these,

131
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,280
he would be moved to tears.

132
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,880
He loves to cry.

133
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
That’s it.

134
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,880
A man of his age,

135
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,560
a man of his size,

136
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,360
crying all the time,

137
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,760
is like a baby.

138
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,120
Nanzheng,

139
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,680
your kindness

140
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,960
will hit all men’s hearts.

141
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,680
Then I’ll try to be

142
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,280
a family of him.

143
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,200
But only if

144
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,800
he accepts me.

145
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,680
In fact, he has always regarded you

146
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,760
as the motivation to struggle.

147
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,720
He always wants to catch up with you

148
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,320
and surpass you.

149
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,840
Sometimes,

150
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,120
I kinda appreciate his silly energy.

151
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,120
It shows me the hope of a man.

152
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,240
Your comments

153
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,640
make me feel

154
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,000
a sense of urgency.

155
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,920
Gu Yiye will also have a sense of urgency.

156
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,240
Isn’t that good?

157
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,600
Race, learn, catch up, help, and surpass.

158
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,440
Only in this way can we have the motivation to move forward.

159
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,080
But it’s his rhythm.

160
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,240
Also, a rhythm that

161
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,040
most people accept and are familiar with.

162
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,720
But not mine.

163
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,720
What rhythm?

164
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,040
In battle,

165
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,320
the most important thing is rhythm.

166
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,040
99% of people

167
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,400
just need to follow.

168
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,160
But someone

169
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,360
has to step up

170
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,160
and find his rhythm

171
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,880
in the noise.

172
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,040
It will be hard to be a different person

173
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,680
from others, right?

174
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,080
I’m not doing well.

175
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,320
Really.

176
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,600
No.

177
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,669
You have done well.

178
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,400
Yiye.

179
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,280
I can understand you.

180
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,400
I know you didn’t mean to neglect me.

181
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,840
You were busy settling down

182
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,440
the affairs of Platoon Leader Zhang’s family.

183
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,240
Your heart

184
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,920
is slowly pulling back from the battlefield.

185
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,160
You are trying.

186
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,600
I can feel it.

187
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,920
Nanzheng,

188
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,040
I feel like I owe you a lot.

189
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,080
I like that you owe me.

190
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,440
Owe me for life.

191
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,160
Then I will never forgive myself.

192
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,320
Don’t say unforgivable things.

193
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:13,920
Yiye,

194
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,440
I think

195
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,800
you should relax.

196
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,560
We are all people who have come back from the battlefield

197
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,240
through hardships.

198
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,240
How nice it is

199
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,400
to be able to

200
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,520
sit next to each other intactly and talk.

201
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,720
Han Chunyu.

202
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,280
Be brave!

203
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,520
Is it Jiang Nanzheng?

204
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,040
No.

205
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,560
This is Han Chunyu.

206
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,480
Hey, Sergeant Han.

207
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,320
By the way,

208
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,520
congratulations on your admission to the military academy.

209
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,680
I’d like to congratulate you

210
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,080
on your bailout to the army academy.

211
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,400
I made a special inquiry.

212
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,840
Our schools are

213
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,800
close to each other.

214
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,760
On weekends,

215
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,840
we can hang out together.

216
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,080
Really?

217
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,600
Sure.

218
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,560
Gao Liang.

219
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,720
I mean,

220
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,840
we are going to be promoted into cadres.

221
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,480
In fact,

222
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,600
there are many things

223
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,320
that would not violate the discipline.

224
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,320
What would be a violation of discipline?

225
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,600
I mean,

226
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,400
we could

227
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,120
hang out,

228
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,120
watch a movie or something.

229
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,320
No problem.

230
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,960
Then let’s invite a few more people

231
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,640
and go to the movies together.

232
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,200
Our company is having the celebration party,

233
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
so, I have to get over there.

234
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,680
I… wait a minute.

235
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,360
We’ll talk tomorrow at the train station.

236
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,760
- I want to tell you that we can…
- Hello?

237
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,080
Excuse me, is Comrade Han Chunyu there?

238
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,600
It’s me.

239
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,800
Who is that?

240
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,720
Do you remember

241
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,080
when I asked you a question

242
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,520
at the front camp

243
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,840
and you gave me a hug

244
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,680
instead of an answer?

245
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,120
Sergeant Han,

246
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,760
is there an unbreakable radio?

247
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,080
Platoon Leader Xia.

248
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,360
Later,

249
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,320
I read the interview with you on the military newspaper.

250
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,600
In order to send back the information in time,

251
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,320
your platoon paid a terrible price.

252
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,800
You finally crossed the minefield.

253
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,880
You were the only one who came back,

254
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,480
along with

255
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,680
the blown-up radio.

256
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,280
I didn’t expect

257
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,560
you to read the report.

258
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,120
After I came back from the front,

259
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,160
my heart couldn’t come back for a long time.

260
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,720
Therefore,

261
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,440
I often read the military newspaper or something

262
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,720
and learned from various channels

263
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,600
what we had experienced.

264
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,720
Comrade Han Chunyu,

265
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,040
you know what?

266
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,760
What that hug of yours

267
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,720
meant to me.

268
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,280
I should hug

269
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,640
every comrade who came back from the front.

270
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,800
They are all my brothers,

271
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,640
and so are you.

272
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,760
Thank you.

273
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,400
Comrade Han Chunyu.

274
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,280
I’m here today

275
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,920
to tell you something important,

276
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,240
and to hear your opinion.

277
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,800
Deputy Company Commander Xia,

278
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,440
if there is anything you need, just tell me.

279
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,840
As long as I can help,

280
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,840
I will do my best.

281
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,280
You will go to

282
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,920
the military academy tomorrow

283
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,480
and become a cadre.

284
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,320
So, I won’t keep you from your progress.

285
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,320
I wonder

286
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,280
if our relationship

287
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,360
can go further

288
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,240
on the basis of comrades-in-arms.

289
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,440
Comrade Han Chunyu.

290
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,080
I like you.

291
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,720
Deputy Company Commander Xia.

292
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,560
Call me Xia Lin.

293
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,600
It’s more natural this way.

294
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,840
What you said is

295
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,840
a bit sudden.

296
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,040
I have a poor cultural foundation.

297
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,320
After arriving at the military academy,

298
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,440
I have many classes to make up.

299
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,480
So, I don’t want to

300
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,760
focus on this issue

301
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,320
for the time being.

302
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,440
Comrade Han Chunyu,

303
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,960
I understand your thoughts.

304
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,200
It’s okay.

305
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,400
I won’t bother you too much.

306
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,280
A relationship is a lifetime event.

307
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,920
It’s not easy to meet someone

308
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,640
who makes your heart flutter.

309
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,320
You

310
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,560
are the girl who makes me flipped.

311
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,120
I don’t want to miss it.

312
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,200
Comrade Xia Lin,

313
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,520
I think

314
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,320
the relationship is a matter of two people.

315
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,280
We are not suitable.

316
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,320
Please forgive my frankness.

317
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,040
We haven’t even started yet.

318
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,000
Why isn’t it suitable?

319
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,760
Because…

320
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,920
Because I have a crush.

321
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:37,920
What?

322
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,720
I’m gonna go back.

323
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,240
Comrade Han Chunyu.

324
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,960
Comrade Han Chunyu.

325
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:50,820
[Zhangmu Station]

326
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,040
The Department of Organization at the Political Science Academy, do you know that?

327
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,800
Report.

328
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,320
I’m going to…

329
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,080
Put things on.

330
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,600
They’re all there.

331
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,640
Diarrhea again?

332
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,320
Oh, come on.

333
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,000
The female soldiers are coming.

334
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,000
I’ve put your book up for you.

335
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,400
What are you doing, Jiang Weixing?

336
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,480
Orange flavored soda.

337
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,560
Sweet?

338
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,760
Yeah.

339
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,940
[Zhangmu Station]

340
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,960
Look at you.

341
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,280
You are really a veteran of love, playing hard-to-get!

342
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,000
Handsome?

343
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,340
[Zhangmu Station]

344
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,960
What are you doing?

345
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,200
Come on, I’ll do it, I’ll do it.

346
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,200
Give it to me. Give it to me

347
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,200
I’ll do it.

348
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,320
I got it.

349
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,000
Well, here you are.

350
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,360
Give it to him.

351
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,760
Hang everything on the mule.

352
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,840
Take care of these things and don’t lose them.

353
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,349
Great.

354
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,700
[Zhangmu Station]

355
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,480
Great. Let’s applaud.

356
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,880
Commander Qin is here.

357
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,720
I know.

358
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:25,520
Commander Zhao.

359
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,800
It’s been two years.

360
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,440
I’m gonna miss you so much.

361
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,600
Before parting,

362
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,200
give me a hug.

363
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,760
That’s even worse.

364
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,400
So handsome, Company Commander.

365
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,240
Good job, Company Commander.

366
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,400
Company Commander.

367
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,000
You can also be handsome.

368
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:57,960
Yeah, right.

369
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,740
[Zhangmu Station]

370
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,440
What are you doing?

371
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,680
Is this handsome?

372
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,400
Handsome, right?

373
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,080
Yiye, Gu Yiye, your letter.

374
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,120
It’s from eastern Guangdong.

375
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,920
Commissar asked me to bring it to you

376
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,360
in case of delay.

377
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:17,800
Thank you.

378
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,760
You’re welcome.

379
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:19,920
Check it out.

380
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,160
Letter!

381
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,600
You can’t even open a letter.

382
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,000
Hello, Comrade Gu.

383
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,160
I’m Zhang Yuanshan, Party Secretary of the village.

384
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,920
Ever since you left,

385
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,880
the village has been praising

386
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,600
the army for its kindness.

387
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,760
We miss you. They miss you.

388
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,520
I shouldn’t have written this letter to you,

389
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,160
but something happened to Zhang Fei’s family.

390
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,400
Shortly after you left,

391
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,520
Zhang’s mom fell ill.

392
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,120
She was devastated by her son’s sacrifice,

393
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,760
and she was too sick to get up.

394
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,720
The village doctor said

395
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,760
she wouldn’t last a few days.

396
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,960
Xiu is reluctant to trouble the troops again.

397
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,960
She’s not willing to write to the army

398
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,560
for help in any case.

399
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,840
The village tried everything,

400
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,080
but there was nothing we could do.

401
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,800
I am writing this letter to you rashly

402
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,120
to ask if you can contact the hospital

403
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,400
to treat Mother Zhang and help Xiu

404
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,040
through your troops.

405
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,920
The 533 train to Gaozhuang

406
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,960
is about to leave.

407
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,800
Passengers who have not yet boarded…

408
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,760
What should we do? The train is leaving.

409
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,480
The train is about to leave.

410
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,000
Qin, take it.

411
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,200
Yiye.

412
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,280
Gu, this is mine and Tong Bing’s.

413
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,400
Yiye,

414
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,240
Xiu is familiar with you.

415
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,480
If you go to help,

416
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,680
she may accept it.

417
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,280
You should go to eastern Guangdong right away.

418
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,520
The problem is how to get there so far away.

419
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,640
It will take a week to get there and back.

420
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,720
If you are late for registration,

421
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,080
you will be punished.

422
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,760
So,

423
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,040
Gu Yiye, you should go there now.

424
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,960
When Gao Liang arrives,

425
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,200
explain the situation to the team leader,

426
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,560
and I will call the academy to explain it.

427
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,160
What are you waiting for? Are you going or not?

428
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,360
If you don’t go, then give me the letter and I’ll go.

429
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,600
Just one.

430
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,960
Yiye goes.

431
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,920
Yiye, don’t hesitate.

432
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,040
This is the time to stand up.

433
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,440
Comrade PLA, the train is about to leave.

Nanzheng, you don’t know that

436
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,880
Platoon Leader Zhang and Xiu had a child,

437
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,440
only a few months old.

438
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,480
What’s more, you don’t know that

439

She was saved at last.

443

[Emergency Room]

445
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,720
made me feel

446
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,240
deeply guilty.

447
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,080
Comrade nurse, how’s Mother Zhang?

448
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,600
You brought her to the rescue just in time.

449
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,720
Comrade, help him to have a seat.

450
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,600
Are you okay?

451
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,760
He carried my mother for 35 kilometers

452
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:27,760
and was tired.

453
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,880
I’ll be fine after a little rest.

454

Don’t worry.

455
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,200
She is in a stable condition. Don’t worry.

456

457
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,880
Comrade Gu, Comrade Gu.

458
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,000
Come here.

459
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,880
Comrade Gu, you can’t do this.

460
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,080
My mom said to me as soon as she woke up,

461
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,360
we can’t let you spend any more money.

462
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,120
Xiu,

463
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,000
I was entrusted by my comrades before I came here,

464
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,240
so, I must take good care of Mother Zhang.

465
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,160
We are a family,

466
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,320
so don’t treat me like a stranger.

467
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,840
I don’t treat you like a stranger,

468
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,600
but you can’t pay the money.

470
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,680
I know you don’t want to show weakness and bother us,

471
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,640
but if you don’t let us

472

do something,

You can’t do that.

before Platoon Leader died,

491
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,360
he told the story of Cao Yuhai,

Before he sacrificed,

494

497
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,200

[Dean’s Office]

499
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,600
he shouldn’t have married Xiu.

on the train back to the academy from eastern Guangdong,

595

and the lonely figure of Xiu at the end of the corridor

599
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,120
made me make a decision.

600
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,200
That means living with Xiu,

00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:17,040
and the weight

758
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,280
all your life.

759
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,400
I can never forgive myself.

760
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,630
I understand.

761
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,360
Hurry up!

762
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,880
Are you being funny here?

763
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,600
If you don’t want to die soon

764
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,120
and die miserable

765
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,880
in the future battlefields,

766
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,150
be crueller to yourselves!

767
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,040
From now on,

768
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,360
whoever stand before you

769
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,960
are your enemies.

770
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,760
If you don’t kill them,

771
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,520
they will.

772
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,320
Harder!

773
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,680
Much harder!

774
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,200
Much harder to yourselves!

775
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,040
You, out!

776
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,560
Brother,

777
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,640
the path from a soldier to an officer

778
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,120
is not smooth at all.

779
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,640
There are thousands of difficulties and obstacles,

780
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,040
and narrow escapes.

781
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,280
But they mean nothing

782
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,120
to me.

783
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,040
The most important thing is that

784
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,840
I’ve made up my mind

785
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,560
to stay away from Jiang Nanzheng.

786
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,480
I will not date her anymore.

787
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:37,760
And...

788
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,640
The situation of Platoon Leader Zhang’s family

789
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:40,880
is not good.

790
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,560
I can sense

791
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,640
the internal changes of Gu Yiye.

792
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,320
It’s just like a mushroom cloud.

793
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,000
We have no idea

794
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,520
what’s waiting for us.

795
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,920
Jiang Nanzheng,

796
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,040
I’m a petrel,

797
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,080
the unstoppable petrel!

798
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,520
Nanzheng.

799
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,480
Yiye.

800
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,680
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

801
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,080
This is for you.

802
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,800
It’s beautiful.

803
00:36:59,080 --> 00:36:59,960
Thanks!

804
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:00,960
I’ll take it.

805
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,760
Have you made remittance for Xiu?

806
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,080
I had been delayed

807
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,320
by the long queue there.

808
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:08,960
Sorry.

809
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,480
That’s okay.

810
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:11,880
Right,

811
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,240
has Mother Zhang been discharged?

812
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,640
Don’t worry. I’ve taken care of it.

813
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,280
How come you don’t wear the red dress?

814
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,520
You promised to wear it for me, didn’t you?

815
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,360
I was not in the mood

816
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,960
thinking of what happened on Platoon Leader Zhang’s family.

817
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,960
I will definitely wear it next time.

818
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,160
Let’s go. The movie is about to start.

819
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,920
It’s a ten-minute walk from here.

820
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,480
Let’s go.

821
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,120
What about not going to the movie?

822
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:44,920
Why?

823
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,840
It’s your favorite movie.

824
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,400
I finally managed to buy the tickets.

825
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,120
I’d rather listen to you,

826
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,400
listen to you talking about the school,

827
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,360
and talking about Platoon Leader Zhang.

828
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,720
I don’t have to report to duty

829
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,280
two hours after the movie.

830
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,760
We can talk about them on our way back.

831
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:02,800
There’s still time.

832
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:03,960
Do you know that

833
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,080
this may probably be the first time,

834
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,600
as well as the last time for us watching movies together?

835
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,400
How come?

836
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,160
Just kidding.

837
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,040
Come on. The first five minutes of the movie are important.

838
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,000
We would get lost if missing them.

839
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,640
Let’s go.

Coming.

846

Hello.

Hello.

00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,120
there will be a friendly basketball match

853
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,840
between Communication Academy and Army Academy.

854
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:00,600
I know.

That’s for boys, right?

856

What are you worrying about?

857
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,120
Our girls are cheerleading.

858
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,760
And I’m the cheerleader.

859
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,840
We will meet

860
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,040
if you take part in the match.

861
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,520
We’re selecting the players.

862
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,440
It’s Xia Lin’s choice. He’s the leader.

863

Xia Lin?

864
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,400
Is he the Deputy Company Commander Xia

865
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,040
from Division Reconnaissance Company?

866
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,320
Yeah, he’s now our tutor.

867
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,120
Such a coincidence, right?

868
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,400
What a coincidence!

869
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,960

870
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,040
What letter?

871

The letter I wrote to you.

872

You should receive it tomorrow.

874
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,640
Why bother to write letters

875
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,560
when we can talk on the phone?

876
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,120
I’m afraid to talk to you in person.

877
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,640
You’re joking about it.

878
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,200
Read the letter first,

879
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,000
