Commander Lu, may I ask you a question?

5
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,600
If we want to damage the enemy's equipment,

6
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,080
and fire special bullets
that burn through shells

7
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,880
we must shorten the twist rate of rifling.

8
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,400
But once it's shortened,

9
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,759
the precision of firing ordinary bullets

10
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,720
will decline.

11
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,800
When the twist rate is shortened,

12
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,560
the spinning of bullets will be reduced

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,400
and the precision will decline by 25%.

14
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,920
Is there any chance

15
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,720
we can produce a gun with two twist rates

16
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,240

17
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,320
Sorry, it's a silly question.

18
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,320

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,480
What do you mean even?

191
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,160
Why can't I be better than you?

192
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,080
It was just your luck.

193
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,160
I did a better job than you,

194
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,240
not only because of my skills.

195
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,600
It was just a shooting competition.

196
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,240
You used tricks.

197
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,320
Why didn't you shoot like us?

198
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,120
I only compete with my own limits.

199
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,040
What do you mean?

200
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,480
I'm not good enough to be your opponent?

201
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,000
We don't win a real victory

202
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,520
unless we compete with ourselves.

203
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,360
Another question.

204
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,280
Think about it.

205
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,000
Even if I defeat you,

206
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,640
will Jiang Nanzheng still think

207
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,960
you're better than me?

208
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,760
Boring.

209
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,360
Attention!

210
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,240
Eyes right.

211
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,360
Eyes front.

212
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,360
Extra competition for tonight.

213
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,880
Firing practice.

214
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:40,960
The result will count.

215
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,320
You'll compete with elder soldiers.

216
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:42,840
Report.

217
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,480
We've never practiced night shooting.

218
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,440
But I'm not scared.

219
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,920
The competition should be flexible.

220
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,360
We'll test what you haven't practiced.

221
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,380
In the daytime, think about
how to shoot at night.

222
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,540
In peace,

223
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,660
think about how to shoot in a war.

224
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,380
Gao Liang and Gu Yiye

225
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,860
are the most hard-working recruits

226
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,180
during the training.

227
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,780
But they use quite different ways.

228
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,500
Let me put it this way.

229
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,220
One uses strength

230
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,700
while the other uses knacks.

231
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,340
Oh, you realized that?

232
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:23,060
[Company]

233
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,740
Gu Yiye

234
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,620
does scientific training.

235
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,740
Gao Liang

236
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,220
focuses on hard work.

237
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,020
So what do you think?

238
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,660
Which one is right

239
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,860
or which one is more effective?

240
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:30,900
Well,

241
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,900
victory is my only standard.

242
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,500
As long as a man can win,

243
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,780
I only care for the result,

244
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,860
not the process.

245
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,180
A commander

246
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,580
should care about the process,

247
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,620
as well as the result.

248
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,380
Division commander.

249
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,940
Qin Hanyong,

250
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,940
the division commander thinks highly of you.

251
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,060
During his inspection this time,

252
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,900
he especially comes here to see you.

253
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,180
I don't want to visit him.

254
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,420
But I have to.

255
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,260
He rubbed my back

256
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,740
and prepared water for my footbath.

257
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,140
He keeps speaking ill of me.

258
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,620
Everyone in the division knows

259
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,140
how many scars I have on my back

260
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,660
and how many corns I have on my feet.

261
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,100
Division commander, please sit down.

262
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,340
No. No. I've got something else to attend to.

263
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,260
Your colonel told me

264
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,020
that you were busy with the training.

265
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,140
How's the training going?

266
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,300
Be brief.

267
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,180
And I'm leaving after you finish.

268
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,620
Your regiment is quite stingy.

269
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,100
You only offered noodles and I'm not full.

270
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,900
I noticed

271
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,100
that Gao Liang has been training hard.

272
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,940
He doesn't even stop in the dorm.

273
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,340
He's still standing upside down.

274
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,220
He's making up by hard work.

275
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,700
He does more than hard training.

276
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,460
You know what?

277
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,300
He even reads secretly in his quilt.

278
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,500
Come on.

279
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,180
I sleep next to him and I'm certainly award.

280
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,380
He keeps whispering in his quilt.

281
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,740
I can't even fall asleep.

282
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,980
[It's everybody's duty to save water]

283
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,460
I sleep on your top bunk
but why do I not know that?

284
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,140
Are you sleepless, Jiang?

285
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,940
Shall we go running for 20 laps?

286
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,660
I'm not going. Go with Gu Yiye.

287
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,380
It's your standard.

288
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,460
I've already increased my running standard

289
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,180
to 30 kilometers.

290
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,580
Look.

291
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,140
With weights!

292
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,660
Gu Yiye,

293
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,580
no wonder you win first place in every item.

294
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,980
You're not training, but risking your life.

295
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,300
Jiang, let's have a private training

296
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,460
and work hard tonight.

297
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,060
No one shall go out tonight.

298
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,020
[It's everybody's duty to save water]

299
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,460
Cadres of the regiment are here.

300
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,180
Why?

301
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,460
When I came out of the company,

302
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,740
I saw our colonel

303
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,260
go there with the division commander.

304
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,620
Your company is the backward company in the division.

305
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,420
Right?

306
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,700
Right.

307
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,900
Some of my soldiers are unruly.

308
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,700
Some of them are disobedient, too.

309
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,540
But there are soldiers with potential.

310
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,260
For example?

311
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,540
Report.

312
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,380
I'm Gu Yiye from the Ninth Squad,
the Ninth Company.

313
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,380
I ask to see the division commander.

314
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:50,940
Qin Hanyong,

315
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,060
what's going on?

316
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,340
Gu Yiye, what are you doing?

317
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,060
Can't you see
we're in the middle of something?

318
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:55,780
I have something

319
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:56,940
to report to the division commander.

320
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,340
Gu Yiye, go back first.

321
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,900
Why do you try to stop him?

322
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,740
Let him in. Come on.

323
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,660
Come on in.

324
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,140
What do you want me for?

325
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:09,859
For your information,

326
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,619
before I met you,

327
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:13,220
I've heard about your heroic deeds.

328
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,339
I really admired you.

329
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,460
I first visited you

330
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,900
because of the withdrawal.

331
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,819
But I failed to see you.

332
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,060
Here I apply

333
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,099
to be transferred
to Night Tiger Company of Regiment 700.

334
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,420
Please approve.

335
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,540
What's your name again?

336
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,580
I didn't hear it clearly.

337
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:38,940
Gu Yiye.

338
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,460
What a special way to ask for a transfer.

339
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,580
Do you know what sort of company

340
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,860
Night Tiger Company is?

341
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:45,940
I do.

342
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,060
It's an ace troop of Troop A.

343
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,060
As early as there was the Red Army,

344
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,060
Night Tiger Company was
a famous model company.

345
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,460
They have won

346
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,620
countless battles.

347
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,900
I joined the army for this company.

348
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,980
I don't want to stay in Regiment 720.

349
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,340
Gu Yiye!

350
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,220
Why do you yell at him?

351
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,660
Let him finish.

352
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,340
A lot of soldiers

353
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,340
want to join Night Tiger Company.

354
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,300
Why do you think

355
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,900
I should transfer you?

356
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,460
I was born in a military family.

357
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,460
I love the army.

358
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,380
I have common military knowledge.

359
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,180
I have good military accomplishments, too.

360
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,700
Speaking of the training,

361
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,460
I'm No.1 in integrated training
in our platoon

362
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,060
and No.1 in shooting of the company.

363
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,780
When we have some more items,

364
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,180
I'll do as well as now.

365
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,260
How's your shooting?

366
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,140
48 rings.

367
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,420
When I'm not in a good condition.

368
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,180
When I am,

369
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,020
I can hit all the bull's-eyes.

370
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,060
You sound arrogant.

371
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,700
You're daring, too.

372
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,620
You knew I was here

373
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,140
and then you came to block me?

374
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,100
There are very few chances
in a grass-root company.

375
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,060
I just want to seize the chance.

376
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,220
Honestly,

377
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,260
I like the way you're doing this.

378
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,300
I hate it a little bit, either.

379
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,580
But now that you applied,

380
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,540
I have to reply.

381
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,580
Chan Dashan.

382
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,780
See?

383
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,060
This is an unnoticed talent of yours.

384
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,060
He's more ambitious than you.

385
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,500
You'll have a shooting tonight?

386
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,540
Yes, chief.

387
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,700
Do the best you can do.

388
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,220
I don't decide

389
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,580
how far you can go.

390
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,260
It depends on you.

391
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:27,860
Yes.

392
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,420
Division commander,

393
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,900
I have another request.

394
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,620
You're greedy. Speak.

395
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,180
I want to confirm something.

396
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,420
Is the bullet in your body

397
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,180
a 9mm bullet

398
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,460
from Parabellum Pistol?

399
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,620
Come on, boy.

400
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,900
Don't try to get in good with me.

401
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,460
I won't tell you until you finish shooting.

402
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,740
Yes.

403
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,300
Chen Dashan,

404
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,620
I'll forgive you

405
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,820
for the noodles.

406
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,660
Go arrange it.

407
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,900
I'm going to watch their shooting tonight.

408
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:04,500
Yes.

409
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,400
Wait.

410
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,260
Don't tell them in advance.

411
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,080
By the way,

412
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,760
ask Gao Liang

413
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,780
to take part, too.

414
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,460
Yes.

415
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,400
Subject, night shooting.

416
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,900
How can we shoot when we can't see anything?

417
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,020
Unit,

418
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,020
in squads.

419
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,020
- Isn't it supposed to be a night shooting?
- Shoot at fixed targets.

420
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,260
It's too bright to see anything.

421
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,940
They're making it more difficult.

422
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,420
Close your eyes.

423
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,220
The blaze will cause visual errors.

424
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,420
If you get spots in your eyes,
there'll be trouble.

425
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,820
Participants

426
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,940
shall determine the shooting target

427
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,380
within ten seconds

428
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,780
after the light beams

429
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,740
begin to move.

430
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,980
When the light beams fade away,

431
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,900
participants shall shoot

432
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,260
within ten seconds.

433
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,420
Remember.

434
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,940
Don't look at the light beams.

435
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,620
When they move,

436
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,780
cover your eyes with your hand

437
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,500
and look through your fingers.

438
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,860
What did you say? Louder. I...

439
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,780
On your marks.

440
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,100
Ten.

441
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,700
Nine.

442
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,460
Eight.

443
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,740
Seven.

444
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,620
Six.

445
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,380
Five.

446
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,980
Four.

447
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,740
Three.

448
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,740
Two.

449
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,420
One.

450
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:43,820
Start!

451
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,580
Stop shooting.

452
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:58,700
Inspect your rifles.

453
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,180
Target one, Gao Liang,

454
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,820
45 rings.

455
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,500
Target two, Zhao Hongliu,

456
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,780
18 rings.

457
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,820
Target three, Niu Mancang,

36 rings.

459
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,100
Target four, Lin Beihai,

42 rings.

461
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,580
Target five, Jiang Weixing,

462
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,020
39 rings.

463
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,820
Target six, Gu Yiye,

464
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,100
47 rings.

465
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,090
Today, the division commander

466
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,340
requested to watch your night shooting.

467
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,820
You haven't practiced it before.

468
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:27,060
Just try your best.

469
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,100
You should relax.

470
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,860
Don't be stressed out.

471
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,460
It's okay if you don't do a good job.

472
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,540
It won't be recorded
in your daily performance.

473
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,740
Let me emphasize one thing.

474
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,300
Your performance

475
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,780
will be directly related

476
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,540
to the honor of our regiment.

477
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,300
I hope

478
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,660
you'll do a good job.

479
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,020
Remain calm

480
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,060
and try

481
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,620
to shoot better than we expect.

482
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,100
Report!

483
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:53,660
Speak.

484
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,300
I'm not nervous!

485
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,780
The more stress I'm under,
the better I'll do!

486
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,900
I'll shoot exceedingly well!

487
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,020
Division commander,

488
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,780
how about not watching the Ninth Company?

489
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,740
Let me transfer several soldiers

490
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,420
from Lu Pingfan's First Company to perform for you.

491
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,460
They start from high bases,

492
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,420
and work very hard.

493
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,420
They will definitely

494
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,340
get in.

495
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,340
Your model company?

496
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:14,980
Knock it off.

497
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,140
I also started from the battalion,

498
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,820
and worked all my way to this position.

499
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,940
I know it too well.

500
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,580
Units only show their pacesetters to leaders.

501
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,420
I want to see the ninth company.

502
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,300
Am I not allowed?

503
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,260
Of course not.

504
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,300
Then cut the nonsense. Let them shoot by turn.

505
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:36,060
[Learn to fight wars from the range]

506
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:33,660
Gao.

507
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,220
The light was too bright.

508
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,620
Now,

509
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,860
I can't see anything.

510
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:41,940
If you can't see anything,

511
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,580
neither can they.

512
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,100
It's too dark to see anything.

513
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,140
Before hearing the scoring,

514
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,380
we can only rely on our ears.

515
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,380
I thought we are going to practice with the old soldiers.

516
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,060
Where is sergeant Mao?

517
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,380
Target six,

518
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,900
prepare to shoot.

519
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,380
It really feels like the last few minutes

520
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,380
before the rifle squad's ambush.

521
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,020
Sir,

522
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,620
it seems that

523
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,620
you even enjoy fighting battles more than drinking.

524
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,900
Report! Shooting is completed!

525
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,040
-That was quick.
-Target seven.

526
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,070
-A “hot head”.
-Prepare to shoot.

527
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,540
All at once.

528
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,220
Quick and neat.

529
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,020
He shot too fast.

530
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,180
That doesn't sound good to me.

531
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,380
Such fast shooting may work during the day.

532
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,500
But in such a night, there's no time for aiming,

533
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,500
unless he can see things in the dark.

534
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,460
You mentioned the first company, right?

535
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,100
Yes.

536
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,660
Bring them, wait for orders.

537
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:13,860
Yes!

[Learn to fight wars from the range]

540
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,020
This shooting sounds good.

541
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,540
Sir, I don't quite understand.

542
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,060
His shooting speed is not even.

543
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,000
Why is he better than the previous one?

544
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,220
Normally, aiming, shooing,

545
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,620

-the more accurate you shoot, right?
-Target five.

548
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,780
Prepare to shoot.

549
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,580
Actually, as an experienced shooter,

550
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,860
you'll notice that

551
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,500
the first one or two bullets

552
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,260
have different trajectories.

553
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:33,140
Because when the first bullet is shot,

554
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,180
the barrel is still cold.

555
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,420
That is the cold gun accuracy.

556
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,580
Therefore,

of the first two bullets

00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,820
is different.

560
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,420
Sweet mother of God.

561
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,940
You must have shot numerous bullets, sir.

Left, right, left.

563
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,100
Sir, the first company is here.

One, two, three, four.

565
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,570
After the ninth company finishes, let them start.

00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,220
Yes.

Target six, Gao Liang.

Target eight, Gu Yiye.

577
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,460
Ten shots, eight hits.

578
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,810
Did you really get so many hits, Gao?

579
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,860
Did you get it wrong?

580
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,700
Maybe you just got lucky.

581
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,140
Nonsense,

582
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,020
I got sharp eyes,

583
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:28,900
alright?

584
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,500
Gao Liang,

585
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,060
it's perfectly normal for Gu Yiye to score high.

586
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,060
He's just playing his normal role.

587
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,740
But you really outdid yourself.

588
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,700
Don't talk nonsense.

589
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,660
Why can't I score high?

Good to see you again.

Si…sir!

594
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,420
You are target six, right?

595
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,220
Yes.

596
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,340
Your shooting speed was very fast.

00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,660
Don't you need to aim?

598
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,740
Sir,

599
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,180
I was a miner,

600
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,900
used to work in the dark.

601
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,820
so I'm used to it.

602
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,710
See?

603
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,140
That's a good lesson for us.

604
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,500
Soldiers are not born good,

605
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,500
they need practice.

606
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,940
We have good soldiers,

607
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,190
but also bad ones,

608
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,380
you know?

609
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,860
You are target eight, right?

610
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:38,900
Yes.

611
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,070
Pretty good.

612
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,770
Tell your colonel,

613
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,500
how can you see things clearly in the dark?

614
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,700
Sir, I…

615
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,260
Just say it.

616
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,180
Yes.

617
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,380
It's dark in the night,

618
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,620
so you can't stare at the target with the center of your eyes.

619
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,740
The wider your eyes open,

620
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,380
the fuzzier the target is.

621
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,020
Retina consists of rod cells

622
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:06,950
and pyramidal cells.

are concentrated in the middle of eyes,

00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,780
mainly used for the day.

626
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:11,980
While rod cells

627
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,620
are distributed around eyes,

628
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,740
and are photosensitive,

629
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:15,940
mainly used for the night.

630

631
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,180
you and Gu Yiye will definitely get in.

632
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,100
Don't be so sure.

633
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,780
Why would we work so hard?

634
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,060
Gao has eyes of the owl.

635
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,740
Gu…

636
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,580
Gu, what's that thing you were talking about?

637
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,020
I have no idea,

638
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,900
don't understand a word.

639
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,620
You see, the rest of us

640
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,300
compete with each other.

641
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,740
But Gu, he can only compete with himself.

642
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:50,900
So unfair.

643
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,420
Unfair.

That's the way it is.

646
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,740

But in the end, it will be fair.

718
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,140
What we need to do,

719
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,140
is to work extra hard.

726
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,580

00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,380
Our company is defeated by the first company, alright?

758
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,220
Just go take the bath.

759
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,100
Come on.

760
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,340
I'm gone take a bath.

761
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,620
Tomorrow is another day.

762
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,700
Hurry up, you guys.

763
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,900
The water will run out soon.

764
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,540
Just leave him alone.

765
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:08,620
It looks like

766
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,220
you still need more practice.

767
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,500
You should know that

768
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,140
you are not qualified for the Night Tiger Company.

769
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:22,700
Section Chief,

770
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,820
I really like the army,

771
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,140
I like being here.

772
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,420
It's warm and lively here.

773
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,420
The army makes me

774
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,100
feel like home.

775
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:36,060
It's just that…there are too many rules.

776
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,500
I can't get them straight.

777
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,580
So I'm always in trouble.

778
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,540
I know that you don't like me.

779
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,820
Nonsense.

780
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,460
Let me tell you this.

781
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,580
When you join the army,

782
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,340
it looks like you are all the same,

783
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,340
but,

784
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,060
you are all very different.

785
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,300
If you think of the military service

786
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,020
as a tower.

787
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,380
Gu Yiye is already on the second floor

788
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,580
or even the third floor

789
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,820
when he joined the army.

790
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,940
While those on the first floor

791
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,020
need to work harder,

792
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,380
and practice harder

793
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,540
to get to the upper floors.

794
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,140
What can I do? I'm on the first floor.

795
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,580
No, you are not.

796
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,100
You are in the basement.

797
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,660
People like you,

798
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,020
most of them

799
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,580
have little talents,

800
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,500
and were born in a poor family.

801
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,620
Just like someone

802
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,500
who's lax in discipline

803
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,500
and makes trouble everywhere he goes.

804
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,020
You see, for the army that takes disciplines seriously,

805
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,820
people like this is the worst kind,

806
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,580
habit like this is the worst kind.

807
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,100
This kind of people will make mistakes.

808
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:45,980
Therefore,

809
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,020
if you want to change your fate,

810
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,500
you'll have to get rid of your bad habits.

811
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,860
Everyone needs to grow up,

812
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,660
and discipline himself.

813
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,260
Yes.

814
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,540
You can't do whatever you want.

815
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,700
Yes.

816
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,300
Oh, no.

817
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,700
My waist starts to hurt.

818
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:08,940
Come on, sir.

819
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,220
Come on, get up here.

820
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,140
- What are you doing?
- I'll carry you.

821
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,180
You'll carry me?

822
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,020
No need.

823
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:17,900
It's okay.

824
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:18,980
I've heard about it.

825
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,740
In the previous battle,

826
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,940
you got shot and a shrapnel was stuck in your waist.

827
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,620
So every cloudy and rainy day, your waist hurts.

828
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,820
It's alright, just get up here.

829
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:26,460
Come on.

830
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,580
No, no, no.

831
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,460
Stand up.

832
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:29,980
Rise!

833
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,180
I'll walk by myself.

834
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,300
The army

835
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,100
has its own rules.

836
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,100
There's no military rank

837
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,060
on our uniforms.

838
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,740
That's very rare

839
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,340
all over the world.

840
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,780
This is because we need to remember

841
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,900
that officers and soldiers are equal.

842
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:55,980
Do you understand?

843
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,260
Yes.

844
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,860
There are four pockets on the officer's uniform,

845
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,460
but only two on the soldier's uniform.

846
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,340
The extra two pockets

847
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,900
represent for responsibility.

848
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,340
Do you understand?

849
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,380
Yes.

850
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,140
You want to carry me.

851
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,380
If we were on the battleground, you can carry me.

852
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,940
But now you can't.

853
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,540
That's discipline.

854
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,420
For the next minute,

855
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,980
I'm not your section Chief,

856
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,340
and you are not a recruit.

857
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,660
From the bottom of my heart,

858
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,020
between you and Gu Yiye,

859
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,660
if I have to choose one to stay,

860
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,620
I'll choose you.

861
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,580
Because he's too excellent,

862
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,220
he has so many chances.

863
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,740
But you,

864
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,540
you need this place.

865
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:51,980
Do you understand?

866
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:57,820
Alright,

867
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,020
welcome,

868
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,540
comrade Gao Liang.

869
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,860
-Keep it up.
-Okay.

870
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:13,980
Thank you, sir.

871
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,940
Bro, I have this strange feeling.

872
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,260
From militaries

873
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,980
like Lu Pingfan,

874
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,340
Qin Hanyong, and Song Jianshe,

875
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,220
I see you.

876
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:29,700
Sometimes,

877
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,860
I feel like they are you.

878
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,220
They make me feel the warmth of family,

879
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,820
lead me out of confusion

880
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:37,180
and loneliness.

881
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,620
[Public Bath]

882
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,860
To hell with your advanced company.

883
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,180
Man to man, I dare you!

884
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:54,940
Gao!

885
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:55,660
Why such a hurry?

886
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,220
Where are you rushing to?

887
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,060
Gao.

888
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,620
The first company insulted us.

889
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,860
They called us rubbish.

890
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,140
So we got into a fight with them in the bathhouse.

891
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,260
Got into a fight?

892
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:05,580
Come on.

893
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,020
Come on.

894
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,700
Stop it!

895
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,860
Save your energy for the practice!

896
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,860
Stop it!

897
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,500
Eighteen moves of the Black Dragon!

898
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:19,980
The palm of the Azure Dragon!

899
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,780
Tripping over by the Jade Dragon!

900
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,100
The Dragon shows!

901
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,820
This is outrageous!

902
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,700
How dare you start the fight?

903
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,380
You are really out of control!

904
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,460
You sure know how to make me proud, huh?

905
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,260
Qin Hanyong.

906
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,980
The ninth company of yours

907
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,020
wants to be the backward company forever, right?

908
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,940
Not so good at practice, but excellent in picking up fights!

909
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,580
And you, Lu Pingfan.

910
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,780
Does your advanced company

911
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,900
have to take shower first?

912
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,060
Is your advanced company

913
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,540
the father of the backward company?

914
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,300
Dashan,

915
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,740
how about letting them go back first,

916
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,220
and deal with the soldiers?

917
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:01,820
Song Jianshe.

918
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,140
Here.

919
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,420
Find out exactly what happened.

920
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,540
Who started this fight,

921
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,260
who stirred up the trouble.

922
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,380
Find it out!

923
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,260
Find some negative examples

924
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,420
and punish them hard!

925
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,500
Unbelievable!

926
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,740
Just a few new recruits,

927
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,460
are they going to ruin the whole Regiment 720?

928
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,580
Yes.

929
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,500
What are you doing?

930
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,540
What do you want?

931
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,700
Wait for your punishment!

932
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,700
Company Commander already knew about this.

933
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,060
He will definitely punish you hard!

934
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,620
You look like you're not convinced.

935
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:56,380
Niu,

936
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,740
why did you start fighting?

937
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,220
Because of the bathwater.

938
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,540
What…just because of the bathwater?

939
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,700
And started a fight?
