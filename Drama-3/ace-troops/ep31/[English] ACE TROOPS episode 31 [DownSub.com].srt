Why exclude Gui'er Ridge?

It is the key experimental area of this place.

This is also my question.

16
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,610
Because it is a mine field,

17
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,490
it is dangerous to carry out.

18
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,610
Should we detour because it is dangerous?

19
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,730

00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,330
I know, I know that is Sister Chunyu.

194
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,970
Carry her home with me.

195
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,850
Send her back with me.

196
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:50,970
Calm down.

197
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,970
She is gone.

198
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,930
Why don't you contact us.

199
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,290
The telephone that we used to look up the lines was bombed up.

200
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,330
The cable could not get connected.

201
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,490
How about the wireless?

202
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:11,530
This freaking talkback has no signal

203
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,650
behind the Xiangsi Village.

204
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,100
[Central Hospital of Military Command]

205
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,500
[Clinic]

206
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,010
Where is the emergency room?

207
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:33,970
Where is the emergency room?

208
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,450
Where is the emergency room?

209
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,370
Where is the emergency room?

210
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,730
Emergency room.

211
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,490
Gao Liang, where is Chunyu, where is Chunyu?

212
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,160
Speak up!

213
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,930
Where did you leave Chunyu?

214
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,130
Speak to me, Gao Liang.

215
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:58,050
We left her at the Gui'er Ridge.

216
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,890
We left her there together.

217
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,570
What did you say?

218
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,450
Say it again, what did you say?

219
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:08,730
Don't shout.

220
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,930
Don't shout, I am begging you.

221
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,250
Keep it down.

222
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:14,890
Let Sister Chunyu,

223
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,170
let her be in peace.

224
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:19,770
Alright?

225
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,460
Nanzheng,

226
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,230
these are the candies

227
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,810
that instructor Han wanted to give you.

228
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,690
She said you did not taste them

229
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,370
when you were drunk the other day.

230
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,690
She told me

231
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,210
she wished

232
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,770
to see you in your wedding dress soon.

233
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,530
I'm the chief designer of Mountain Net Number One.

234
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,850
Because its performance is not up to par,

235
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,130
it led to such a bad result.

236
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,490
I feel guilty about her.

237
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,850
I am willing to accept any punishment.

238
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,730
I was the vice captain of the joint test team

239
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,010
when Mountain Net Number one got tested.

240
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,930
At that time, our Special Forces Two

241
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,370
was responsible for working with them to verify.

242
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,890
I'm the one who didn't insist on covering Gui'er Ridge.

243
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:45,970
I am primarily responsible

244
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:47,970
for this.

245
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,130
You guys don't need

246
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,330
to fight over responsibility.

247
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,690
I have to stress

248
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,690
what Han Chunyu stepped on is not an ordinary mine.

249
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,450
They got blown up twice.

250
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:58,650
This is

251
00:11:59,090 --> 00:11:59,930
a rare case.

252
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,930
The military has set up a task force

253
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,730
to investigate.

254
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,970
You want to take primary responsibility?

255
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,370
I should have taken it.

256
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,130
Xia Lin.

257
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,650
Tell you the truth.

258
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,050
In holding you accountable.

259
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,930
Chief's view is

260
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:20,770
to be as light as possible.

261
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:24,850
Which chief?

262
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:26,410
Commissar.

263
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,970
He said you're the martyr's family.

264
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,450
Thank you for his kindness.

265
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,330
But I've thought about it.

266
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,170
I'll never run away from this responsibility.

267
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,410
Xia Lin.

268
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,360
You've got to calm down.

269
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,920
Have you considered the consequences of this?

270
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,840
The order to appoint you

271
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,080
as Colonel of Regiment 720

272
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,040
has been officially approved by the Military Command.

273
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,520
If you take the main responsibility,

274
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,800
this matter will definitely get failed.

275
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,600
You may even have to

276
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,240
face the risk of changing careers.

277
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,720
Xia Lin.

278
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,960
I'm watching how you grow up.

279
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,680
I know how much you love this job.

280
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,600
Otherwise, you wouldn't have

281
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,480
overdue served in the army for so many years,

282
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,840
and shamelessly stayed

283
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,280
in the division reconnaissance,

284
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,720
until you

285
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,320
put on this uniform.

286
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,800
Otherwise,

287
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,200
you won't fall again and again,

288
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,320
and each time you have thrived on pressure,

289
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,600
and tried hard until today.

290
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,280
You are right.

291
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,840
I really love this job.

292
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,640
More than love

293
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,480
but obsession.

294
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,720
Before this accident,

295
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,920
I had never thought of doing any other job.

296
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,920
But because of my fault,

297
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,720
Han Chunyu,

298
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,200
my comrade in arms,

299
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,240
the one I loved the most is gone.

300
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,960
This is not just about my personal feelings.

301
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,880
If something goes wrong with the army,

302
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,440
someone has to take responsibility.

303
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,840
So,

304
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,360
this responsibility,

305
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,600
I can't escape,

306
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,880
I have to take.

307
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,640
In this way,

308
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,920
I will feel a little better.

309
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,440
Not just because of Chunyu,

310
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,960
but because of my love.

311
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,680
If I run away from it,

312
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,000
Chunyu would look down on me

313
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,200
if she found out.

314
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,680
Chief.

315
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,640
I have only one request now.

316
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,600
Please approve it.

317
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,920
Brother.

318
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,920
I failed to save her life,

319
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,320
I can't forgive myself.

320
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,280
Just as I can't forgive myself

321
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,080
for not having a chance

322
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,520
to ask for your forgiveness.

323
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,260
[Honor with the glorious team Shame with the decaying team]

324
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,040
She's like another you.

325
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,600
I admit

326
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,440
I am totally knocked down.

00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,040
She said it's nice for her

381
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,630
♫ I still remember ♫

382
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,040
to have a sister like you.

383
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,720
♫ The river we helped each other cross ♫

384
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,810
♫ I still remember ♫

385
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:14,220
♫ The song I shouted with tears ♫

386
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:20,720
♫ We have been together ♫

387
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,660
♫ And never been apart ♫

388
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,320
Jing.

389
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,440
What do you see?

390
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,800
Jing.

391
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,640
I'm Uncle Gao Liang.

392
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,840
Jing.

393
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,080
I'm Aunt Jiang.

394
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,660
Jing.

395
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,360
Can't you see?

396
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:06,880
Jing.

397
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,920
Jing.

398
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,600
Don't you see?

399
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,800
I want to wait for mom.

400
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,720
I won't open my eyes

401
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,560
until mom comes.

402
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,600
So you see none of us are your mother,

403
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,240
right?

404
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,280
None of you three are my mother.

405
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,900
She can see.

406
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,480
Yes.

407
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,440
Where is mom? When is she back?

408
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,320
Why isn't she here now?

409
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,680
Jing.

410
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,600
Your mother

411
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,840
is a soldier.

412
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,920
And a soldier has to carry out her missions.

413
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,480
She's out on a mission.

414
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,240
She is brave.

415
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,400
Before she went,

416
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,240
she asked me to tell you,

417
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,720
she loved you so much.

418
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,040
The place she goes,

419
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,680
it's dark,

420
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,420
there's no light.

421
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,260
She said

422
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,520
you must open your eyes,

423
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,640
see the world,

424
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,960
and see the light.

425
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,480
What you see

426
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,280
is what she sees.

427
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,400
Do you get it?

428
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,280
Why is there no light where mom goes.

429
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,720
Jing.

430
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,960
Because your mother

431
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,520
left you the light.

432
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,280
Really?

433
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,880
What I see, Mom can see it too?

434
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,320
Yes.

435
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,680
Jing.

436
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,800
Open your eyes, okay?

437
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,640
That's how mom wiped my face.

438
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,560
Jing.

439
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,280
Good girl.

440
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,840
I'm Aunt Jiang.

441
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,840
Mom Han told me

442
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,280
before she left

443
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,960
to be your mom temporarily

444
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,200
before she is back.

445
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,160
Is that okay?

446
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,320
No. I only want Mom Han.

447
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,720
-Reporting for duty.-Come in.

448
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,120
I can tell you are not in a good mood.

449
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,720
Can you still execute your task?

450
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,320
Chief,

451
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,280
the Military Command has sent mine sweeping teams

452
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,430
to clear the mines in the Gui'er Ridge again.

453
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,920
I think I am more  familiar with the conditions there.

454
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,480
So I would like to apply

455
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,800
to sweep the mines in the front.

456
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,240
Aren't you attending the contest against the First Battalion of the Red?

457
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,000
You mentioned before that

458
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,600
practice is for fighting.

459
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,800
Mine fields

460
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,200
are the closest places

461
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,960
to battlefields in peaceful times.

462
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,800
I don't want innocent people

463
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,480
to die

464
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,040
in that mine field after many years.

465
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,280
As soldiers,

466
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,040
the trainings

467
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,480
and contests

468
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,960
are all for

469
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,400
the peaceful lives

470
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,400
of people.

471
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,600
I'm glad that you can think like that.

472
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,160
But I won't permit your application.

473
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,400
That's not what you should do.

474
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,240
Chief.

475
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,720
Soldiers present

476
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,320
for people's deeds.

477
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,600
How can it not be my duty?

478
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,880
Can I only be called a member of special troops

479
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,240
when I fly to the sky and go under the sea with the camouflage clothing?

480
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,200
If the soul

481
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,280
of me as a member of special troops is lost,

482
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,520
why should I still care the shell?

483
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,160
Fighting is the duty of soldiers.

484
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,800
Under any pressure,

485
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
they should be able to control their emotions,

486
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,320
analyze problems,

487
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,200
and give a precise attack.

488
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,480
I will give you 10 seconds to walk out of the emotion.

489
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:47,960
Yes, sir.

490
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,200
The battlefield will give you none.

491
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:07,800
Your turn.

492
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,120
Gao Liang. You have let me down.

493
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,560
As you are in this mood,

494
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,200
I cannot send you to the mine field

495
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,480
nor

496
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,800
assign you to

497
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,480
execute any dangerous tasks.

498
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,160
Reporting for duty.

499
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:31,880
Come in.

500
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,080
Emergency meeting of the War Room is ready.

501
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,400
Inform Gu Yiye of First Battalion of the Red of Regiment 700

502
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,200
to attend the meeting.

503
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,080
Yes, sir.

504
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,480
Director Wang,

505
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,720
what happened?

506
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,120
You just lost

507
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,600
the qualification to attend a fight.

508
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,280
Reporting for duty.

509
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,200
Come in.

510
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,800
How much do you know about terrorist organizations?

511
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,160
In March, 1991,

512
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,360
Flight 117 from Singapore was hijacked.

513
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,200
In May,

514
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,920
Gandhi, the former prime minister of India, was murdered.

515
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,360
In February, 1993,

516
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,760
US World Trade Center exploded.

517
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,080
In December, 1994,

518
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,880
an airliner of Air France was hijacked in Northern Africa.

519
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,320
In March, 1995,

520
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,160
the Sarin Poisonous Gas Incident in the subway of Tokyo.

521
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,760
In April, the explosion of Oklahoma in the US.

522
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:40,920
In June,

523
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,360
hostage-taking in Budennovsk, Russia.

524
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,520
In November,

525
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,280
Rabin, the prime minister of Israel, was murdered.

526
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:46,760
That's enough.

527
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,720
What about China?

528
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,440
Have a seat.

529
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,080
Don't think terrorist organizations are far away from us.

530
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,720
They not only act abroad

531
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,800
and in the border provinces of China.

532
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,120
It is very possible

533
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,160
that they have already

534
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,600
reached places under our nose.

535
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,840
Director Wang.

536
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,960
Introduce the condition.

537
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:11,880
Yes, sir.

538
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,320
This morning,

539
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,600
an encrypted emergency telegram was received.

540
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,120
A week ago,

541
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,040
two armed border-crossers

542
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,280
had an exchange of fire with border armed police.

543
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,560
The armed police failed to chase them.

544
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,640
Two of them died and three injured.

545
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,920
The other party had abundant experience in fighting in jungles

546
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,560
and was cunning and sophisticated.

547
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,720
It is confirmed that they crossed border with weapons.

548
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,560
What kind of weapons?

549
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,160
According to the description of the combatants there,

550
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,720
they were attacked by surprise

551
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,520
by two Scorpions.

552
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,000
And two Type 81 Assault rifles were taken by them.

553
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,440
Can they be drug dealers?

554
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
According to the analysis of the Department of Public Security,

555
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,080
they don't match the features of drug crime.

556
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,600
There is one more condition.

557
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,200
Yesterday afternoon at five,

558
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,320
the local police found some clues.

559
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,400
The suspects were located and monitored in a residence successfully.

560
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,760
37 armed police participated in the fight.

561
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,640
The capture was acted at four in the morning.

562
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,960
And it had a gunfight again.

563
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,040
What was the result?

564
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,880
Three joined the gunfight.

565
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,320
It ended at seven in the morning.

566
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,240
One was killed and the other two escaped.

567
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,920
As for the armed police,

568
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,920
five died and six injured.

569
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,880
And three innocent people were killed.

570
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,080
According to the analysis of the corpse

571
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,680
and the check of combatants,

572
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,680
none of the three in the gunfight

573
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,320
were the two escaped a week ago.

574
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,800
According to the preliminary judgement of the police,

575
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,080
they are relevant

576
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,800
multiple illegal armed border-crossers.

577
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,840
They are sophisticated in military skills

578
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,200
and have abundant experience in fighting.

579
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,840
And they are well armed.

580
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,560
It is suspected that it is highly relevant

581
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,880
to terrorism.

582
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,880
What is their goal?

583
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,640
That is the point.

584
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,720
We do not know

585
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,440
their goal yet.

586
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,280
The local police and armed forces

587
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,360
have asked Commander Yang of the Provincial Military Command for help.

588
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,440
Commander Yang sent a report to the Military Command,

589
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,600
which commanded the group army,

590
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,600
the Special Force Team,

591
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,920
the local police

592
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,040
and armed forces

593
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,240
work together to capture the nefarious

594
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:55,960
criminals.

595
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,480
The group army commanded that

596
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,760
the action

597
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,160
should be executed

598
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,360
by the Special Force Team and Regiment 700 together.

599
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,600
Yes, sir.

600
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,180
The contest between Special Forces Two and First Battalion of the Red

601
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:12,880
will be delayed.

602
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,680
Transfer capable personnels

603
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,160
and form a special force detachment.

604
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,560
Gu Yiye will be the commander of the detachment.

605
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,040
Yes, sir.

606
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,120
Reporting for duty.

607
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,720
I apply Gao Liang to be

608
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,760
the deputy commander of Special Forces Two.

609
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,080
Please approve.

610
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,120
Denied.

611
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,680
Considering his mood,

612
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,840
it is not appropriate for Gao Liang to join the fight.

613
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,680
Form two detachments

614
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,760
and take turns to be in position.

615
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,880
Before the local police

616
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,200
and armed forces sound the all-clear,

617
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,600
you should be in position and get ready all the time.

618
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,440
Yes, sir.

619
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,840
Why are you looking at me?

620
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,800
You are having a rest too?

621
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,640
Being kicked out.

622
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,080
You are a relative of a martyr.

623
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,720
My condition is similar to yours.

624
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,440
Gao Liang.

625
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,520
It was me that should be sorry for Chunyu.

626
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,240
In the past,

627
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,680
I was restless,

628
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,160
ambitious

629
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,640
and longed for being a leader.

630
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,560
I know you

631
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,710
do not like me

632
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,280
behaving like that.

633
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,520
Neither did Chunyu.

634
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,060
If this time

635
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,360
I still need to take advantage of

636
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,160
the sacrifice of Chunyu

637
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,600
to get promoted,

638
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,400
I will look down upon myself.

639
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:22,700
[Special forces, special spirits. Special forces, special humans. ]

640
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,840
But you cannot think like that.

641
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,600
Well.

642
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,840
Sister Chunyu definitely doesn't want to see you be like this.

643
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,720
Gao Liang.

644
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,360
I feel bad

645
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,320
for Chunyu.

646
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,920
And in the force,

647
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,840
I have done many wrong things.

648
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,480
Alright.

649
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,080
Don't repent in front of me here.

650
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,240
We can communicate more in the future.

651
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,200
Communicate more.

652
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,520
Then there definitely will be quarrels, right?

653
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,440
Alright.

654
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,480
I'm leaving.

655
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,400
What do you mean?

656
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,960
You really drive to see me?

657
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,000
You came for nothing?

658
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,640
There was something.

659
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,160
But seeing you like this.

660
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,320
You are already taking a rest.

661
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:19,960
Never mind.

662
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,280
I won't bother you.

663
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,920
It's ok. Say it quickly.

664
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,240
I am almost bored to death.

665
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,840
If I am okay,

666
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,240
I would be in the position of Gu Yiye

667
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,560
and have no time for you.

668
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,680
Hurry up and say it.

669
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,040
OK.

670
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,440
I would like to go to Xiangsi Village.

671
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,660
The second mine sweeping action has ended.

672
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,050
The superior departments have agreed.

673
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,450
Actually, I have started the investigation

674
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,010
and found something.

675
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,340
What did you find?

676
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,840
I have checked

677
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,120
the rainfall of the Gui'er Ridge

678
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,800
in recent months.

679
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,400
There were two times of heavy rain.

680
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,200
But in Lidong,

681
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,620
there was no mountain torrents.

682
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,380
That is to say.

683
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,140
If there are no other reasons,

684
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,380
the possibility of Sister Chunyu

685
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,820
stepping on rolling mines

686
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:08,940
is about zero.

687
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,290
There is one more possibility.

688
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,580
The mine sweeping group did not clear all the mines.

689
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,820
I thought so, too.

690
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,900
So several days ago,

691
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,660
I went to the Military Command

692
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,700
and asked the captain of the Mine Sweeping Team.

693
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,700
He denied it completely,

694
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:25,180
saying it was impossible to have any left,

695
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,940
especially in Lidong.

696
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,900
He took people to sweep the area by himself.

697
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,900
And he was unhappy with me

698
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,660
because he thought I slandered their team's honor.

699
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,820
Then, there is only one possibility.

700
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,740
Someone planted mines on purpose.

701
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,260
And

702
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,420
according to the description of the other two soldiers,

703
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,260
that mine

704
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,980
is not like the mines being left in previous wars.

705
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,380
The Mine Sweeping Team had never seen it before.

706
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,140
I

707
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,980
have found some similar types

708
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,700
from the equipment table of foreign forces.

709
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,740
I have also thought about it before.

710
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,980
But who would plant mines

711
00:32:58,980 --> 00:32:59,780
in mine fields?

712
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,380
What's their purpose?

713
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,740
This is it.

714
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,900
Xia Lin,

715
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:03,780
have a look.

716
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,730
It was not blown up by bombs

717
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,620
but cut off by pliers.

718
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:12,770
It's obvious.

719
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,330
The guy failed at first and left the mark.

720
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,330
He must put forth his strengths at the second time and succeeded.

721
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:19,770
That't true.

722
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,659
It seems that the landmine

723
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,460
was laid by an expert.

724
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,500
And his purpose is obvious.

725
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:29,980
He wants to kill

726
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:31,940
the signalman who came to check the lines.

727
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:33,940
And this.

728
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,330
It is 9mm.

729
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,020
Was it left from the past?

730
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,580
Before liberation, this is

731
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,580
the most common type of bullet.

732
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:45,380
Yeah.

733
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:46,900
FN M1900, FN M1903, and FN M1910.

734
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,100
All pistols were loaded with this kind of bullet.

735
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,250
But this one is new.

736
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,580
It seems that it was produced in recent years.

737
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,770
Besides those old pistols,

738
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:56,420
there is another type of gun that is using these bullets.

739
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,420
Italian M9 handgun.

740
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,420
Sir,

741
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,660
do you remember me?

742
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,740
I have come here once.

743
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,300
Sir, don't be afraid.

744
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,180
We are from the People's Liberation Army.

745
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,460
I know that.

746
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,240
But you can't take away my guns.

747
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,440
Sir,

748
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,040
we...

749
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,440
Sir!

750
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,000
Why is he so afraid of us?

751
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,480
When I came here with Nanzheng

752
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,840
to rescue Jing, I had met him.

753
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,240
He has already told us.

754
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,480
He is afraid that you will take away his guns.

755
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,280
The Gun Control Regulations were established last year nationawide.

756
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,160
Here

757
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,880
is montane ghettoize

758
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,200
but is not qualified for hunting.

759
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,000
All guns should be handed over.

760
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,560
Let's walk further.

761
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:01,550
Hello.

762
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,600
Nanzheng.

763
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,720
Hou Jian.

764
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,560
Did you go to sleep?

765
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,960
No, I am sorting the projects.

766
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,240
The thing you asked me to do,

767
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,920
Jing's household register for enrollment,

768
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,320
needs a certificate from the original place of domicile.

769
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,080
From the original place of domicile?

770
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,040
How about Civil Affairs Bureau?

771
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:17,880
I tried.

772
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:18,840
That's not enough.

773
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,160
Got that.

774
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,370
Thank you, bye.

775
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,320
Mom! Mom!

776
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,000
Jing, what's wrong?

777
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,000
Come on.

778
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,280
What happened?

779
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,500
Did you have nightmares?

780
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,140
You are sweaty.

781
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,020
I dreamed about mom and dad.

782
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,480
I heard a boom.

783
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,800
And they all flew into the air.

784
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,240
Sweetheart. Nothing happened.

785
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,280
This is a dream. It's not real.

786
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,560
Auntie will be here with you.

787
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,120
Nothing will happen, ok?

788
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,560
Auntie, I wanna go home.

789
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,360
I miss mom.

790
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,480
Jing,

791
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,160
your mom

792
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,640
has gone to a faraway place.

793
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,360
She wrote us a letter, right?

794
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,480
Did you forget?

795
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,240
I wanna go back to Xiangsi Village.

796
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,320
My dog is waiting for me at home.

797
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,920
How about this?

798
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,880
Aunt Jiang will ask Uncle Gao

799
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,160
to bring your dog here.

800
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,600
But my dog doesn't know Uncle Gao.

801
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,230
He will be frightened.

802
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,400
Auntie, I wanna go home.

803
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,240
I miss mom.

804
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,480
Here, here.

805
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,640
From now on,

806
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,480
Aunt Jiang is also your mom,

807
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,440
ok?

808
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,800
Come on. Don't cry, sweetheart.

809
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:36,820
Who's there?

810
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,040
Sir!

811
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,420
Hello, sir.

812
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,880
You are non-natives, right?

813
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,560
We came here to collect medicines.

814
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,060
Collect medicines?

815
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,660
Do you

816
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,500
live in the village?

817
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,100
No.

818
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,060
Here is

819
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,220
the observation station.

820
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,540
There are landslides in every rainy season.

821
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,420
Others can't get in once the road is stuck.

822
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,980
I am responsible for

823
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,540
prediction and early warning.

824
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,260
If we want to get in the Xiangsi Village,

825
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,620
is this the only way?

826
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,620
There is another path. But

827
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,500
the path is heading beyond the borders.

828
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,540
When was the last landslide?

829
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,020
About three months ago.

830
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,940
But that was not severe.

831
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,460
They cleared the roads in a month.

832
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,460
You have asked me so many questions.

833
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,060
Are you aimed at taking away my guns?

834
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:55,580
[Lan Municipal Public Security Bureau]

835
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,700
Squad leader of the ninth squad!

836
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,300
Soldier from Division 234, Regiment 720,

837
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,380
the Third Battalion, the Ninth Company, the third platoon, the ninth squad,

838
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,620
Lin Beihai

839
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:17,900
is here ready for your order.

840
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,180
Beihai!

841
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,660
You

842
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,180
disappeared after retiring from the army.

843
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,620
You don't wanna see us, right?

844
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,580
You should know my character,

845
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,020
holding back bad news.

846
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:53,660
Your leg...

847
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,580
It was amputated. I got an artificial limb.

848
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,300
Although I took off my military uniform,

849
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,420
I keep thinking about the military camp

850
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,700
and you guys.

851
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:05,260
After leaving the army,

852
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,380
I had tried two different jobs.

853
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,140
But once they knew my condition,

854
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,300
they would refuse me.

855
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,670
But I am competent.

856
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:12,860
Finally,

857
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,570
the undersecretary of Division 234,

858
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,420
Li Guilin, who used to be a soldier,

859
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,280
picked me.

860
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,480
He employed me

861
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,920
and gave me this uniform.

862
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,400
Come on.

863
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,640
Don't worry.

864
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,320
There's no problem at all.

865
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,160
My child is 8 years old now.

866
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,640
Hongliu's mother

867
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,920
is being well taken care of.

868
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,520
Don't worry.

869
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,480
Three gangsters and prisoners

870
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,520
dived from here.

871
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,080
When the speedboat approached,

872
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,240
they were quickly picked up.

873
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,760
How many people were picked up?

874
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,000
Three.

875
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,040
One escaped.

876
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,480
We didn't find his body.

877
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,160
Maybe the body was carried away along the river.

878
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,440
This time, our police accidentally caught

879
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,800
an important figure of their gang.

880
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,440
However, because of the difficulties we had

881
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,430
when we checked his identity with foreign police,

882
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,990
we failed to lay emphasis on the case.

883
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:03,170
And that caused the armed hijacking.

884
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,560
Some time ago,

885
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,920
the two groups of people who stole into our territory

886
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,050
came for this important figure?

887
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,530
Yes. And they also hired professional mercenaries.

888
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,920
Can you investigate

889
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,180
the identity of this person?

890
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,480
We just got the report.

891
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,040
The Interpol offers a reward of a million US dollar.

892
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,320
His code name is "Earl".

893
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,520
By now,

894
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,760
criminal's escape route

895
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,160
is still unclear.

896
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,200
We still don't know where

897
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,560
he landed and turned to the land route.

898
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,420
We have got a speedboat.

899
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,580
Hang on to it.

900
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,940
The enemy has strong firepowers

901
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,380
and high-level tactics.

902
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,260
Don't worry.

903
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,140
We will do everything in our power to support you.

904
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,380
I also want to know that

905
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,360
if the Command has thought about

906
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,080
that the enemy didn't turn to the land route

907
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,600
but escaped by water

908
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,520
and left the country.

909
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,320
The fuel oil of the speedboat

910
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,840
is not enough for the trip.

911
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:52,760
Also,

912
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,240
downstream,

913
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,800
we had arranged checkpoints.

914
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:56,960
After all,

915
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,400
it is just a speed boat.

916
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,960
Its firepower and protective equipments

917
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:00,800
are limited.

918
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:01,920
It cannot break

919
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,120
the water police's line of defense.
