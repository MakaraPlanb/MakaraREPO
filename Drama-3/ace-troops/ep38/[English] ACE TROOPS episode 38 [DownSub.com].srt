experiencing the feeling of being a hostage.

192
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,480
Take it as a kind of experience.

193
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,840
It may be useful some day.

194
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,880
Just forget it.

195
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,360
I am not angry.

196
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,680
It doesn't matter.

197
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,600
Right.

198
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,880
Who won't be angry?

199
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,880
It's hurting my self-esteem.

200
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,160
What's wrong with peeing frequently?

201
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,840
That's because of the wounds

202
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,000
on the battlefield.

203
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,080
You've brought a diaper with you?

204
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,480
Sticking-plaster.

205
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,000
Who asks you to pee eight times a day?

206
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,200
Hold it.

207
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,460
Yes.

208
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,800
Song, stick with it.

209
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,960
It's just a day.

210
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,960
That's right.

211
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,120
If Gu Yiye fails to take down the Qiaotou Island today,

212
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,440
I swear I will

213
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,240
hang him up and hit him after I go back.

214
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,080
Chief.

215
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,320
So here are the night snacks?

216
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:39,880
Yes.

217
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,040
OK. Bring them in.

218
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,840
-Yes. -Hurry up.

219
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,520
Be quiet.

220
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,160
Nanzheng.

221
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,760
Engineer Jiang, we are going back first.

222
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,200
I am looking for you.

223
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,840
The data you broadcast this morning

224
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,880
was read by chiefs.

225
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,800
They are all satisfied.

226
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,960
The commander also asked

227
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,000
whether they could sponsor the Mountain Net Number Two.

228
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,640
He said that troops were enjoying benefits

229
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,960
while the Command Military was paying.

230
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,200
Did the Red Army withdraw again today?

231
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,320
Yes. Soon after it got dark.

232
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,440
And they chose to withdraw.

233
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,480
Why did they do it again?

234
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,160
It was mainly because Gu Yiye

235
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,560
lost ten tanks

236
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,640
and more than 200 soldiers on the island.

237
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,600
He learned his lesson

238
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,480
so he withdrew soon after it got dark.

239
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,160
He launched all attacks

240
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,400
in daytime.

241
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:27,800
ow about him?

242
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,120
How is he doing?

243
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,240
You mean Gao Liang?

244
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,880
Wait, didn't you have the real-time data?

245
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,080
You didn't see him?

246
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,040
He only showed up once today.

247
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,400
And left quickly.

248
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,440
No wonder.

249
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,400
He seldom stays at the Operational Command Post.

250
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,960
Jiang Weixing is in that position.

251
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,280
The signal is poor

252
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,360
and smoke and fire is heavy outside.

253
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,880
And the director department

254
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,360
asks for the whole scene.

255
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,120
They emphasized not to shoot the details.

256
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,800
So you can't see him.

257
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,320
What?

258
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,440
You miss him?

259
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,880
Just now,

260
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,160
did you notice

261
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,520
why I drank the rainwater

262
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,120
instead of negotiating with hem?

263
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,680
Since the attack from yesterday's afternoon,

264
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,680
the Special Force Team has not put flour on

265
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,880
the face of the Regiment 700's soldiers they captured.

266
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,840
Also,

267
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,920
it is almost the noon.

268
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,200
The three bottles of fresh water they promised

269
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,320
haven't been sent yet.

270
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,280
He did not forget.

271
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,160
Gao Liang

272
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,800
is doing one thing.

273
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,400
He wants to delay the battle

274
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,200
until the time that no one could predict.

275
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,520
It is true that they are soldiers from Regiment 700.

276
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,280
I know my soldiers.

277
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,920
They are all hung in the water.

278
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,800
I didn't dare to stay longer.

279
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,320
I think

280
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,320
they are the 25 soldiers

281
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,840
that were captured at the first attack.

282
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,880
Any guards?

283
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,760
There's one.

284
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,280
We have to figure out ways to release them.

285
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,520
Release them?

286
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:16,920
Wait.

287
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,160
For what?

288
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,360
Calculate the number and hang them up again?

289
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,760
After being locked up for several days,

290
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,760
you get crazy?

291
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,640
For these 25 soldiers,

292
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,320
who are they?

293
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,200
Captured personnel.

294
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,080
They are captured but not dead.

295
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,000
After they are released,

296
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,360
they are sill powerful enough to fight.

297
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,520
Division commander.

298
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,640
You get crazy.

299
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,360
Has Qin Hanyong driven you mad?

300
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,880
Regiment 700 cannot lose to the Special Force Team.

301
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,400
If we are just waiting here,

302
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,840
even though we are thirsty or starving to death

303
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,400
Gu Yiye can't get in.

304
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,240
Then what do you want to do?

305
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,760
I know the ammunition depot of the Blue Army.

306
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,680
As long as we release our soldiers,

307
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,480
take the weapons,

308
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,680
bomb the ammunition depot

309
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,480
and make the headquarter a mess,

310
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,680
the Special Force Troop will lose.

311
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:24,920
But

312
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,320
we are not combat troops

313
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,760
but hostages.

314
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,040
That's the point.

315
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,240
Don't you know the duties of hostages?

316
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,560
Never give up to the hijackers

317
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,080
and seize chances to revolt.

318
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,400
Go.

319
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,280
Release them.

320
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,520
I am from the official troop.

321
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,640
I cannot do that.

322
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,960
This is emergency.

323
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,560
Let me think about it.

324
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,560
Think about what?

325
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,440
If you are not in,

326
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,200
I will do it on my own.

327
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,960
What happened?

328
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,920
Hush.

329
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,680
Keep silent.

330
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,040
I am the division commander of Division 234.

331
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,560
Song Jianshe.

332
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,520
Everyone, keep silent.

333
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,480
Watch out.

334
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,320
Are you ok?

335
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,560
You are out.

336
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,320
You cannot violate the disciplines.

337
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,200
Is that clear?

338
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,200
Yes.

339
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,880
Chief.

340
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,720
They are so bad.

341
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,080
Cut off food and drinks

342
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,560
and eavesdrop our conversation.

343
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,920
Save your complaints.

344
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,680
Say them later.

345
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:41,880
Now,

346
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,160
I am leading you to

347
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,440
take revenge.

348
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,240
Who are combatants?

349
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,480
Report.

350
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,560
leader of Platoon 1, Company 2 under the Battalion 1 of Regiment 700

351
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,400
Zhao Xiaoyong is ready for your order.

352
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:53,920
OK.

353
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,760
Now, I will recover your identities as combatants.

354
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,360
We will work in three groups.

355
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,160
Two groups are going to take their weapons and their channels away.

356
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,600
The other group

357
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,880
follow me and bomb their ammunition depot.

358
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,400
Clear?

359
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,200
Clear.

360
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,120
Wu Bo, Chen Tong.

361
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,920
Yes.

362
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,840
Both of you pick seven soldiers.

363
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,520
The rest follow me.

364
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,640
Yes.

365
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,000
Don't move.

366
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,470
Go.

367
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:21,860
Chief,

368
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,440
this is the situation.

369
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,340
Got it.

370
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,880
What?

371
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,680
What happened?

372
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,920
Where is Song?

373
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,240
Song went to rescue the captured personnel of the Red Army.

374
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,320
To rescue the captured personnel of the Red Army？

375
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,360
Yes.

376
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,320
And then

377
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,360
he will take them to blow up the ammunition depot of the Blue Army.

378
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,200
This is bullshit.

379
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,400
The director department stated clearly that

380
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,800
superiors cannot intervene

381
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,560
and let commanders fight themselves.

382
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,640
If the Division 234 is doing so,

383
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,440
I will take part in the battle, too.

384
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,280
Qin, calm down.

385
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,480
Theoretically,

386
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,320
you can actually do so.

387
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,080
According to the director department,

388
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,560
we are hostages now, right?

389
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,280
As criterion for hijackers to blackmail,

390
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,000
which are commonly called hostages,

391
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,440
among us

392
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,320
there will be hostages who are willing to cooperate,

393
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
hostages who

394
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,160
get Stockholm syndrome,

395
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,280
and hostages who would fight back.

396
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,320
I think Song belongs to the last type.

397
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It not only fits the real identity of hostages

398
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,040
but also the content of the practice.

399
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,080
In other words,

400
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,280
when you two

401
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,880
are planning secretly,

402
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,160
I have already figured out your plan.

403
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,560
That's also why

404
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,920
I did not stop them.

405
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,640
Chief,

406
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,880
you gave birth to the Special Force Team

407
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,280
and you cultivated them.

408
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,480
It is your own son in certain degree.

409
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,960
If you are rebelling, just do it together.

410
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,360
Stop there.

411
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,040
Since the beginning of the drill,

412
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,280
you have been in opposing camps,

413
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,200
causing conflicts.

414
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
I didn't criticized you.

415
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,960
And you think that i am indulging you?

416
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,720
What's your current identities?

417
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,960
You are hostages.

418
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,349
Can you be hostages of your own troop?

419
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:17,160
The people who lock you up

420
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,349
are your enemy.

421
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,440
Not being aware of your identities,

422
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,560
how can you rebel?

423
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,920
The ammunition depot is here.

424
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,560
Open the door.

425
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,640
In the past a few days,

426
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,280
I haven't said a word.

427
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,680
But at this critical moment,

428
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,480
I think I have to say something.

429
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,560
Considering from the aspect of actual combat,

430
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,760
Song's starting point

431
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,920
is fine

432
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,000
and courageous.

433
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,120
But technically,

434
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,160
there are some problems.

435
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,880
If the purpose of

436
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,760
releasing the captured personnel

437
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,040
can be altered,

438
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,400
not aiming at bombing the Blue Army's ammunition depot

439
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,400
but aiming at

440
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,720
the information.

441
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:25,800
What does that mean?

442
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,600
It means

443
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,000
they should work separately

444
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,400
and send out information.

445
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,840
Such an action

446
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,680
will be perfect, right?

447
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,920
As an Information Minister, you did learn something.

448
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,720
You are seriously studying the actual combat.

449
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,560
Thank you, Chief.

450
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,080
Chief,

451
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,320
we cannot open the door.

452
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,840
Who's there?

453
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,320
Chief!

454
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,080
Being busy?

455
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,600
What are you still waiting for?

456
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,240
For the Spring Festival?

457
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,600
For the chief setting off firecrackers for you?

458
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,520
Hands behind your head. Crouch.

459
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,560
Crouch. Hands behind your head.

460
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,680
Chief,

461
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,600
take a rest.

462
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,560
You are captured.

463
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,240
After the drill of Camphorwood Station,

464
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,160
I have sworn that

465
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,320
in the rest of my life,

466
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,880
I will not be a captive again.

467
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,560
But you did again.

468
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,080
Hand over your guns.

469
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,800
Chief, you are violating the rules.

470
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,480
So what?

471
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,920
Come on.

472
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,880
Chief is old. Be more careful.

473
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,320
Come on!

474
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,200
Fall in battle?

475
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,080
Failed to escape?

476
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,080
Song Jianshe...

477
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,640
Politically,

478
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,120
we call it sacrifice.

479
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,600
But

480
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,800
in terms of information work,

481
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,520
we won't announce it to the public.

482
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,040
He can only be the hero on the intelligence front.

483
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,200
If so, I...

484
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,920
I actually admire Song.

485
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,320
He is a real soldier.

486
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,840
It seems that we've reached an agreement.

487
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,400
This kind of situation

488
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,720
has never happened before.

489
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,200
It is the first time.

490
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,080
However,

491
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,080
throughout out the world,

492
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,120
it hard to tell whether it will happen again.

493
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,080
If that's the case, I have a suggestion.

494
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,360
Report Song's performance

495
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,600
to the Military Command,

496
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,800
and ask for an award for him.

497
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,680
If you agree,

498
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,080
raise your hands.

499
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,080
Water?

500
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,600
Good boy.

501
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,240
Your mom didn't give birth to you for nothing.

502
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,920
I didn't cultivate you for nothing.

503
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,440
Where did you get it?

504
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,840
I fill it with the freshwater  from the pool in north.

505
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,920
It's not an easy task, but I met a nice guy.

506
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,440
Ma Jianfei.

507
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,640
Did you lose your mind?

508
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,560
Company commander...

509
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,320
The freshwater in the pool

510
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,760
is poisoned.

511
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,400
Even though you taste a drip of it,

512
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,760
you will be regarded as fall in battle.

513
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,400
Do you want to trap our company?

514
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,920
But if you don't drink it,

515
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,960
you will bleed to death.

516
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,200
But I'll die righteously.

517
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,520
Company commander, I heard that

518
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,600
the water was not poisoned.

519
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,080
If you die, we will lose our company commander.

520
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,840
He's right.

521
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,640
The water

522
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,960
is clean.

523
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,760
They just dropped a bottle of vitamin.

524
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,880
But according to the rules of drilling,

525
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,360
we take

526
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,880
the water as being toxic.

527
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,840
Yes.

528
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,360
Commander.

529
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,640
Private from the Ninth Company, the Second Platoon, the Fifth Squad,

530
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,760
Ma Jianfei,

531
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,360
broke the roles

532
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,480
and stole forbidden items.

533
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,040
I...

534
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,600
The company commander of the Ninth Company,

535
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,640
Li Guoqiang,

536
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,600
ask for punishment for him.

537
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,600
I didn't do it for myself.

538
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,160
I did it for our company.

539
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,120
I don't want the Red Army to defeat us

540
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,280
and lose the island.

541
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,280
We are the Live and Die Together Company.

542
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,400
I don't want buddies in my company to die.

543
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,080
I...

544
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,640
I want to do something for them.

545
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,760
Are you still reluctant to admit mistakes?

546
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,160
Do you know how serious your mistake is?

547
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,280
That's enough.

548
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,840
You drank the water?

549
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,280
Just two sips. I didn't dare to drink more.

550
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,200
Ok.

551
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,080
You should go

552
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,560
and find Director General Sun.

553
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,520
Tell him that you fell in battle.

554
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,160
Go.

555
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:06,880
Yes.

556
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,320
The company commander of the Ninth Company.

557
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,120
Yes.

558
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,520
Go with him.

559
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,200
I can't leave the Ninth Company.

560
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,480
We only got these people.

561
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,200
We should respect the rules.

562
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:28,960
Yes.

563
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,160
Platoon leader.

564
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,800
Yes.

565
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,200
The paltoon leader of the Second Platoon, Ding Youyuan,

566
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,280
is reporting.

567
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,520
From now on,

568
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,960
you act as the company commander of the Ninth Company

569
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,240
and command battle.

570
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,920
Bring your company commander

571
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,680
to the treatment room.

572
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,880
Yes.

573
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:52,300
[Chief Director]

574
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:57,500
[Red Army Director]

575
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,720
Yes.

576
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,740
[Red Army Director]

577
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,320
Report. The Red Army reported that

578
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,920
they organized a night attack one hour ago.

579
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,880
Now, they've landed on the intertidal zone.

580
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,400
The Red Army changed their strategy.

581
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,960
Contact their Command Post

582
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,720
and ask them about

583
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,240
the reason why they changed the time to attack.

584
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,760
Unnecessary.

585
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,560
It is stated that there will not be plans

586
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,240
and let them battle on their own.

587
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,440
Leave him alone.

588
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,640
Deputy commander,

589
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,280
Gu Yiye

590
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,160
is taking risks again.

591
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,960
That's right.

592
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,680
Win with fancy strategies.

593
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,640
Win with high risks.

594
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,360
Attack the enemy

595
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,440
at the most unexpected timing and place.

596
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,200
Maybe the war will end.

597
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,000
You woke up?

598
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,720
How come I fell asleep?

599
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,280
You have stayed up for several nights.

600
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,520
You only slept for three hours.

601
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,080
And

602
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,360
the second batch of equipment has arrived.

603
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,480
Department of Communication wants the leader to sign.

604
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,840
But the team leader is having an intravenous drip in the clinic.

605
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,560
I will go.

606
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,520
They fought on the island for half a night.

607
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,520
The Red Army attacked in a point-to-point way.

608
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,720
And they eliminate

609
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,800
every fire bases of the Blue Army.

610
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,120
The Blue Army suffered a lot.

611
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,560
Their soldiers are less than half a company.

612
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,840
And the Red Army

613
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,400
doesn't seem like they will withdraw.

614
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,240
They have built support position in the intertidal zone.

615
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,800
If so,

616
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,000
the Red Army is getting ready for the final shot.

617
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,920
Observers of the director department have reported that

618
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,640
the commander of the Red Army

619
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,800
is not on the island.

620
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,480
Then where is he?

621
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,720
Arraign Niu Manang.

622
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,920
I wonder that

623
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,920
whether everyone in the Blue Army

624
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,280
is a tough guy.

625
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,480
Wake up.

626
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,160
Don't be shy.

627
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,720
Sit here.

628
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,160
What?

629
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,760
The supply of Regiment 700

630
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,040
is not so good.

631
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,240
Just eat.

632
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,600
I will release you after you finish.

633
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,080
I will attack the island.

634
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,200
Attack the island.

635
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,520
Attack the island.

636
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,240
Just say it.

637
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,200
You want to wait for the Special Force Team

638
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,200
or surrender beforehand?

639
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,040
I am warning you.

640
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,120
Show me your respect.

641
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,640
Or I can let the Special Force Team

642
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,840
bring a dead body back.

643
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,880
Cool. A dead body.

644
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,720
You made it?

645
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,840
The drill hasn't finished.

646
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,920
We are stilling fighting.

647
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,800
Cool. Go on.

648
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,520
That's cool.

649
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,600
Stop mumbling.

650
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,920
Just eat.

651
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,120
I will send you away sooner or later.

652
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,120
Gu Yiye.

653
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,000
I am curious about something.

654
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,000
Why Gao didn't catch you

655
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,240
and let you hide in the corner?

656
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,760
Do you feel good?

657
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,960
If you feel bad, I am right here.

658
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:55,840
OK?

659
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,800
After I finish the can, you can shoot me.

660
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,480
Just kill me quickly.

661
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,640
I want to die as a martyr.

662
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,680
Among the monuments of the Special Force Team,

663
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,120
I have to occupy

664
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,880
a brisk.

665
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,160
To

666
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,600
Mancang.

667
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,120
Gu Yiye, Gu Yiye.

668
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,000
How come you turn out to be like this?

669
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:34,980
[Sword of the South]

670
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:36,840
Honestly.

671
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,460
You are fantastic. Very fantastic.

672
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:45,260
[Sword of the South]

673
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,440
Among the field grade officers of the A Army,

674
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,800
you are definitely the top one.

675
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,440
Top one.

676
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,720
But the Romance of the Three Kingdoms tells the truth.

677
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,840
Now that we got Zhou Yu,

678
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,120
why bother to bring Zhuge Liang?

679
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,360
We don't have Zhuge Liang.

680
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,030
We have

681
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,300
Gao Liang.

682
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,680
Don't mention him in front of me.

683
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,560
Yiye

684
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,000
Do you think that

685
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,960
you lock me up and make me stupid?

686
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,880
The drill isn't over.

687
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,240
48 hours.

688
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,680
You think I won't tell right?

689
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,560
You lock me in the ship's bottom

690
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,400
so that I can't see the sun.

691
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,040
You are right.

692
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,920
But you forget one thing.

693
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,480
Look at my soldiers.

694
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,880
They relieve guard every eight hours.

695
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,240
How many times in total?

696
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,240
You think I can't figure that out?

697
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,360
The drill isn't over?

698
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,040
You are attacking the island?

699
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,760
Who are deceiving?

700
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,800
Who are you attacking?

701
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,600
That's fun.

702
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,880
I care about too many things.

703
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,360
I bombed the reefs

704
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,960
for fear of

705
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,720
injuring the observation team.

706
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,040
Gu.

707
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,680
Let me tell you.

708
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,040
Gao

709
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,560
knows you so well.

710
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,640
He knew you were so cautious that

711
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,600
without preparation,

712
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,800
you won't take action.

713
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,000
So when we

714
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,560
were making plans for the battle,

715
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,120
we decided to avoid competing head-to-head with you.

716
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,640
You got it?

717
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,760
When you were working hard on the ocean,

718
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,000
two thirds of us

719
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,000
were sleeping in the underground facilities.

720
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,800
Do you know what we called it?

721
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,440
Turtles.

722
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,600
Ninja Tuetles.

723
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,040
Oh, and the observation team.

724
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,120
As soon as they landed on the island,

725
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,360
Gao sent them

726
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,600
to rest in the safest fortifications

727
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,880
and took good care of them.

728
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,280
Yiye,

729
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,040
why you didn't predict that?

730
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,680
Yiye.

731
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,160
You little fool.

732
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,560
What?

733
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,280
You cannot hold it?

734
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,840
That's right.

735
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,040
I know.

736
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,320
Failure of taking down the island

737
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,640
is not good for writing a report,

738
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,440
right?

739
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,200
Can we make a deal?

740
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,400
When you are writing your report,

741
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,520
can you neglect me?

742
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,000
I had been fighting for two days.

743
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,080
You are the only captive left.

744
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,320
If I neglect that,

745
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,080
the reputation of Regiment 700 will be awful.

746
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,720
You can mention me.

747
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,880
Cool. Talking about me. Anything you want, OK?

748
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,760
But that's worthless.

749
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,880
I didn't tell you anything, right?

750
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,080
You did.

751
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,040
You said that when I was attacking,

752
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,440
two thirds of you

753
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,040
were sleeping in the underground fortification.

754
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,360
What did you call it?

755
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,880
Ninjia Turtles.

756
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,760
You forget the words you've just said?

757
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,960
How about writing my report in this way?

758
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,360
The captured soldier of the Blue Army, Major Niu Mancang, said that

759
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,200
the entrance of the

760
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,480

The entrance is not on the mountainside.

00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,160
It is at the bottom of the cliff in the south-east corner.

without any backup.

It is not over yet.

885
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,840
He has two ways to go.

886
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,120
The first one is

887
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,560
giving up

888
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,080
and saving the rest lives.

889
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,600
But you know that

890
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,840
he won't choose this way.

891
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,280
I don't care about

892
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,600
delaying the drill for two more hours.

893
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,280
What I really care

894
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,320
is reducing the casualties of my troops.

895
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,200
During these four days,

896
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,920
he has consumed half of my military strength.

897
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,520
I don't want the number

898
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,800
to increase.

899
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,560
Otherwise, even though I take down the island,

900
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,320
I could not

901
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,840
ask my superiors to record my meritorious deed after I go back.

902
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,560
And?

903
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,680
My soldiers are tolerating.

904
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,000
I cannot make sure that

905
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,200
they won't do something that exceeds what is proper.

906
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,040
That may be a slaughter.

907
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,200
And you are

908
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,360
his only soft spot.

909
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,280
I hope after he sees you,

910
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,360
he will be restless

911
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,600
and break down.

912
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,240
At least from the outlook,

913
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,560
he could be a little bit more feeble.

914
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:39,960
In that case,

915
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,720
less of my soldiers may die.

916
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,720
That's contemptible.

917
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,320
I admit it.

918
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,080
What if I refuse?

919
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:51,800
You will not.

920
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,520
You are an expert in information.

921
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,880
And it is a rare chance

And

925
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,640
you cannot avoid your emotions.

926
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,720
In terms of the drill,

927
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,280
you are not a combatant

928
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,320
but a citizen employed by us.

929
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,480
After landing on the island,

930
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,040
you have no right to

931
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,640
give them military assistance

932
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,360
or real

933
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,840
our military secrets to them.

934
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,840
Wait.

935
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,160

936
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,400
to take 50 boxed meals there.

937
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,240
This is an actual combat.

938
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,600
I will tell you

939
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,280
they are dying,

940
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,320
and all I can do

941
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,760
is to prevent them from starving to death.

942
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,680
At least in the public's opinion,

943
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,240
my reputation could be better.

944
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,360
But actually?

945
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,720
But actually,

946
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,480
I don't know

947
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,640
how many people they still have.

948
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,000
But I hope

949
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,440
there won't be too many.

950
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,880
Because

951
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,080
I poisoned the boxed meals.

952
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,400
Gu Yiye.

953
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
It is lucky that

954
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,080
I didn't go further with you.

955
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,080
I am flattered.

956
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,120
The battle is still on.

957
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,960
According to the rules,

958
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,880
I can't call you chief now.

959
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,080
Please forgive me.

960
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,480
You are coming to handle the aftermath?

961
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,280
Yes.

962
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,600
How will you

963
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,880
deal with us hostages?

964
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,480
I need to confirm a detail.

965
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,680
You have to be here.

966
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,000
I am the commander of the Blue Army.

967
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:50,180
[Map of A Army's Operational Area]

968
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,600
Director Xia,

969
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,640
the commander of the Blue Army is calling.

970
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,520
Transfer it here.

971
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,120
Yes.

972
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,640
Director department of the Operation Azure.

973
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,720
Four days ago,

974
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,760
the observation group became the hostages.

975
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,880
But I haven't received

976
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,040
the detailed identities

977
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,200
of the hostages form the superiors.

978
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,280
Now I need to know

979
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,040
the detailed identities of each one.

980
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,640
Does this question

981
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,880
have actual impact on the battle?

982
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,480
Yes.

983
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,800
I need to know

984
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,480
whether they are civilians

985
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,640
or the enemy's personnel.

986
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,000
If they are the latter,

987
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,120
I need to know their correct identities

988
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,120
and the detention task

989
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,360
the superiors have given to me.

990
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,560
They are important figures of the Red Army

991
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,960
so your task is

992
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,160
keeping the hostages with you.

993
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,560
Got it.

994
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:29,880
From now on,

995
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,040
I won't talk to the director department any more.

996
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,320
I will report my plan first.

997
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,640
After the Red Army launches the attack,

998
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,920
detention time for the hostages will start counting down.

999
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,520
As long as

1000
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,200
any one of my army is still fighting on the island,

1001
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,080
hostages will be alive.

1002
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,000
No one could enter

1003
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,600
the detaining site,

1004
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,120
or the tripwire bomb will explode.

1005
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,240
If the resistance on the island comes to the end,

1006
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,040
according to the plan,

1007
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,160
hostages will be executed.

1008
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:54,920
None of them can survive.

1009
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:55,880
Over.

1010
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,160
Wait.

1011
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,700
Hello?

1012
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,760
Director Xia, he turned off the intercom.
