I'm sorry.

I didn't finish the task.

Come on!

00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,420
Does it hurt?

11
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,340
No.

12
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,620
Fine. You are a stone which can't feel the pain.

13

Take off your hat.

Why do I have to take off the hat?

I'll change fresh dressing for you.

If I had finished the task,

00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,300
I would feel very good now.

Come on! Let's start!

Gao Liang, Army B will use this train

40
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,660
to send weapons and ammunition to South Town.

41
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,260
They want Division 234 to be caught unawares.

42
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,460
In this way,

43
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,020
Division 234 will be defeated in this place.

44
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,820
We'd better not sleep.

What shall we do?

46
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,620
Shall we learn from the Railway Guerilla?

47
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,980
Let's bomb the train.

48
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,659
You can't do this when we are fighting them.

49
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,500
This place is filled with ammunition.

50
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:41,980
If you bomb the train,

51
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,180
all the captives will die.

52
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,500
I'll use a pickax to destroy the railway track.

53
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,140
They can fix it.

54
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,460
They can fix it?

55
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,980
I'll steal some hand grenades

56
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,500
and bomb the track. Can they fix it then?

57
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,659
They can do rush repairs.

58
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,780
I bomb it and they can do rush repairs?

59
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,540
After an airport is heavily bombed,

60
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,740
they can do rush repairs within 3 to 4 hours.

61
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,220
It's just a railway track.

62
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,020
That's the job of the army.

63
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,540
What do you think we can do?

64
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,780
I think

65
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,980
we should destroy the track

66
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,100
while the train is running.

67
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,620
If the train is derailed,

00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,020
they can't do rush repairs.

69
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,540
Fine.

00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,660
Let's do it then.

71
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,500
I think

72
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,860
we have to

73
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,020
destroy something

74
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,700
so that Army B won't be able to repair it.

75
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,100
But the consequence should not be too serious.

Do you understand?

00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,780
You mean

92
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,340
I loved lighting up the wick of a bomb.

they were able to bomb the railway track

190
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,740
and start the train.

191
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,980
They could cause the train to be derailed.

193
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,380
The new recruits are so bold.

194
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,180
No one knows what problems they will cause

195
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,220
in the future training.

196
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,180
We must investigate this at the fastest speed.

197
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,100
Whose idea was it?

198
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,420
Who did it?

199
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,220
Such soldiers are like

200
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,060
time bombs in the army.

201
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,220
They must be punished.

202
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,260
Or they should leave the army.

203
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,260
New recruits can leave the army,

204
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,620
Regiment 720 can't leave.

205
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,020
We must find the cause from inside.

206
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,620
Division Commander,

207
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,860
our regiment has lagged far behind

208
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,060
in military training.

209
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,500
Especially after the reaffiliation,

210
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,060
we were always a drag on the Division.

211
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,820
If the general is incompetent,

212
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,980
the effort of the army will be wasted.

213
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:18,900
I have to criticize myself.

214
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,460
You first told me the reasons and then the difficulties.

215
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,500
After that, you criticized yourself.

216
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,500
Chen Dashan,

217
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,900
you are very good at

218
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,900
self-criticism.

219
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,020
I'll remember your self-criticism.

220
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,380
What's your condition?

221
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,340
Division Commander,

222
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,780
I want to start with the source of the problem.

223
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,900
I want five cadres.

224
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,500
How many?

225
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,260
Five.

226
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,860
That will be more than half of the cadres

227
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,340
who are in the "Four Modernizations" training this time.

228
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,860
Division Commander, you should use a heavy hammer
to sound the best drum.

229
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,660
Two.

230
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,620
I will ask two most professional Company cadres

231
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,300
in the Division to go to your regiment.

232
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,060
They will be a great help to Regiment 720.

233
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,420
Pay attention to the training, mindset,

234
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,140
style of work, and cultivation

235
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,460
of the new soldiers.

236
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,100
After two rounds of screening,

237
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,820
there must be highly qualified soldiers in your regiment.

238
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,820
Yes!

239
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,860
Regiment 720 will learn from Regiment 700.

240
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,100
Talking without practicing.

241
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:05,700
No.

242
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,380
Practicing without talking.

243
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,500
When an army is not fighting a war,

244
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,660
its problems will be simple and clear

245
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,020
like the fleas on a bald head.

246
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,700
However, when you

247
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,180
get ready to solve the problems,

248
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:21,980
you will find that

249
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,460
the problems

250
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,580
are like the enemies on the battlefield.

251
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,220
They are good at hiding and disguise.

252
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,300
You might hurt your allies.

253
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,540
Leading an army

254
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,470
is like fighting a war.

255
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,020
You can never relax.

256
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,300
Division Commander, we have won in this drill,

257
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,380
but it was a narrow victory.

258
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,700
We have won?

259
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,460
Is it a true victory if we

260
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,620
depended on two scouts to win?

261
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,100
Not knowing how we have won

262
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,900
will keep me awake at night.

263
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,380
Winning by chance is not something we can control.

264
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,940
It's more dangerous than failure.

265
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,060
Let me tell you,

266
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,460
this time, Division 234

267
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,700
could turn the tide

268
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,940
mainly because of two comrades.

269
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,660
One is called Qin Hanyong.

270
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,580
His great contribution was to get close to the enemies.

271
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,100
He is a cadre.

272
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,180
The other one is called Xia Lin.

273
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,620
I have the emphasize that

274
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,100
he is a soldier.

275
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,980
This time, he was not only rewarded,

276
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,180
he has also made an exception and
has become a cadre.

277
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,980
Make an exception and become a cadre,
my comrades-in-arms.

278
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,420
Think carefully

279
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,900
about how to learn from him.

280
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,620
What did he do?

281
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,220
Xia Lin

282
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,380
went to the enemy's rear area

283
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,860
and discovered their troops in ambush.

284
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,700
He fired off a red signal flare

285
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,380
and saved our Division.

286
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,700
What signal flare?

287
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,620
What red signal flare?

288
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,740
In the drill,

289
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,100
how many signal flares have we fired off?

290
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,620
What a question!

291
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,140
He fired off one signal flare
and became a platoon leader.

292
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,060
If you fire off several more signal flares,

293
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,300
you will become a cadre in the Regiment.

294
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,820
Only one signal flare?

295
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,660
Red?

296
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,460
Sergeant, I fired it off!

297
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,820
I fired it off!

298
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,380
Stop bragging!

299
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,700
You fired it off. You fired it off.

300
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,220
I did fire it off!

301
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,339
Believe me. I fired it off with the gun

302
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,740
of Mr. Li in Army B.

303
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,300
Gu Yiye saw it.

304
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:14,940
Hey, man!

305
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:15,980
I was not there.

306
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:32,860
[Station of Regiment 720]

307
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,580
We have arrived.

308
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:36,980
We have arrived at the regiment headquarters.

309
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,420
Yes!

310
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:46,100
[Army 53082 of PLA]

311
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,140
Shuanggang. We have really arrived at the regiment headquarters.

312
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,180
It's gorgeous!

313
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,740
One, two, three, four!

314
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,540
Who can you blame?

315
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,460
We can only blame ourselves for dropping the ball.

316
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,300
The chief of staff

317
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,620
will continue to pay attention to this issue.

318
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,820
You received the soldiers.

319
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,740
You know what was going on.

320
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,700
The training of these new recruits

321
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,500
is very important.

322
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,180
Give me some advice on

323
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,500
how to organize the company of new recruits.

324
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:13,580
Regimental Commander,

325
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,700
I'm just the Chief of Military Affairs Unit.

326
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,380
Don't abase yourself.

327
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:18,980
Your modesty is fake.

328
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,340
Tell me directly.

329
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,260
Yes!

330
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,620
Regimental Commander,

331
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,060
many new recruits of this year

332
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,700
are very

333
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,020
very lively.

334
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,660
Some were fighting each other on their way coming.

335
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,100
Well,

336
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,140
during the drill at Zhangmu Train Station,

337
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,060
in front of the cadres,

338
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,700
some of them just did what they want.

339
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,540
Of course,

340
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,300
the result was a good one.

341
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,220
But

342
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,740
when I recall this,

343
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,660
I'm covered with cold sweat.

344
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,220
You are also afraid?

345
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,580
How many new recruits

346
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,660
are like this?

347
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,580
Over eighty.

348
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,020
So many!

349
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,300
Therefore, Regimental Commander,

350
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,260
if our regiment wants to rise,

351
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,300
I suggest

352
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,220
we concentrate

353
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,580
the troublemakers.

354
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,740
In this way, the management will be easier.

355
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,100
Concentrate them

356
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,780
and solve difficult problems.

357
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,340
The achievement is not important.

358
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,140
The management will be easier.

359
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,100
If they are in different units,

360
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,900
you will be too busy to attend to all.

361
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,220
Too busy to attend to all.

362
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,780
You'll be put in a double squeeze in the future.

363
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,380
It's a good idea.

364
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,380
From a positive perspective,

365
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,700
we can choose new recruits

366
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,660
with higher qualities

367
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,860
-and put them in a company,
-Yes.

368
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,580
which can be considered as a modeling company.

369
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,540
Well,

370
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,500
in this way, will other people feel that

371
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,500
they have been given up?

372
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,260
Give up?

373
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,140
Give up on who?

374
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,300
The speed of a train depends on the engine.

375
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,500
Let the models take the lead.

376
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,380
We will bring about an upswing!

377
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,020
It's settled.

378
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,260
We will use this method.

379
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,500
Yes!

380
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,900
When organizing the companies for the new recruits,

381
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,300
put those with better performance

382
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,300
in the First Company.

383
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,740
Put the troublemakers

384
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,060
in the Third Company.

385
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,060
I think we can punish them later.

386
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,100
We can observe them for a period of time

387
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,260
and give them one more chance.

388
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,540
What do you think?

389
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,580
The chief of staff won't allow us to postpone the punishment.

390
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,980
In his words,

391
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,340
we need to investigate it as soon as possible
and give them severe punishment.

392
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,020
We can ask them to leave the army.

393
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,940
What can we do?

394
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,820
Follow the instructions of the chief of staff.

395
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,660
You can handle this.

396
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,740
Yes!

397
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,500
Excuse me!

398
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,420
Regimental Commander, I've come...

399
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,060
You've come. You've come.

400
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,460
You think I don't know your purpose?

401
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,220
You've come to request for punishment, right?

402
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,100
You've come to plead for the soldiers who had caused trouble, right?

403
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,820
I've been talking about it for a long time.

404
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,420
Regimental Commander,

405
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:16,780
I do know some new recruits

406
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,660
left the Division

407
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,300
and bombed the railway track at Zhangmu Train Station.

408
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,700
I should take responsibility.

409
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,500
Do you think

410
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,860
you can shoulder the responsibility for me?

411
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:24,500
Fine!

412
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,380
Come here!

413
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,820
Sit on this chair

414
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,260
and be the Regimental Commander!

415
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:33,660
Listen to me!

416
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,340
I'll repeat this again.

417
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,940
Listen carefully!

418
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,700
You didn't leave the Division.

419
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,700
Nor did you give them an order to bomb the railway track.

420
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,140
It had nothing to do

421
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,660
with you at all.

422
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,300
One is the Chief of Military Affairs of Regiment 720.

423
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,660
The other is a grassroots officer

424
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,620
from the Division.

425
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,460
If I punish you two,

426
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,420
who will

427
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,140
solve the problems of Regiment 720 in the future?

428
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,660
Am I not looking for trouble?

429
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,460
But, Regimental Commander,

430
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,260
it's unfair

431
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,180
for those new recruits.

432
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,260
That's right.

433
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,340
Unfair?

434
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,780
Lu Pingfan,

435
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,340
you are an officer as well as a student.

436
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,820
Have you become too bookish?

437
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:12,860
For a soldier,

438
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,100
there is only discipline and sacrifice!

439
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,100
Why are you still standing there?

440
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,700
Sir!

441
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,020
The Division wants our regiment

442
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,220
to organize the commending meeting.

443
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,340
It will be a ritual

444
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,940
where new recruits will receive collar badges and cap cockades.

445
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,300
Won't that be a farce?

446
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,660
How can new recruits receive collar badges and cap cockades?

447
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,380
Which fool has...

448
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,020
Division Commander gave this order.

449
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,460
He said the new recruits

450
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,020
had passed the test.

451
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,900
The order of the Division Commander.

452
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,580
The purpose of the Division Commander is very clear,

453
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,380
that is, to encourage them and to spur them on.

454
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,420
We should understand it.

455
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,060
We should organize the commending meeting well.

456
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,980
We must guarantee its complete success.

457
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,460
Yes!

458
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:35,220
[Headquarters of Regiment 720]

459
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,460
Hail to the Chief!

460
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,140
Salute to everyone!

461
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,860
The drill

462
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,420
was a test

463
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,780
for all members of Division 234.

464
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,780
A lot of problems have come to light.

465
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,540
We have also shown our fighting spirit.

466
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,500
We fear no hardship nor death.

467
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,740
In the end, we won victory in the drill.

468
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:51,980
Now I will announce

469
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,300
the units and individuals

470
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,740
that will be commended by the Division.

471
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,620
The following people will be awarded Merit Citation Class III.

472
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,620
You two, sit down.

473
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,350
The following are the people being awarded by the Division:

474
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,560
Regiment 700, the Third Battalion, the Sixth Company...

475
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,020
Sit down, please.

476
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,460
Sit down.

477
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,080
Soldiers in Reconnaissance Company:
Dong Guohui, Wang Guangwei.

478
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:36,620
Gao Liang!

479
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,260
Yes!

480
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,540
If you don't want to sit down,

481
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,540
you can stand up.

482
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,860
I can sit down.

483
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:42,980
Mr. Song,

484
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,180
Why do you want to talk to us now?

485
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,820
They are holding the commending meeting downstairs.

486
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,940
If I'm being commended

487
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,100
and they can't find me in the company,

488
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,020
how anxious they will be!

489
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,940
I don't want to affect

490
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,860
the procedure of the commending meeting.

491
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,380
You are in a good state of mind.

492
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,180
You are very optimistic.

493
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,140
It's a pity

494
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,660
that it's a wrong guess.

495
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,220
I've asked you to come

496
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,060
because I want to talk about

497
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,260
something very important with you.

498
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,980
Do you still remember what happened during the drill?

499
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,860
It's good that you still remember.

500
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,340
I have three points to make.

501
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:23,820
First,

502
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,020
did you

503
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,140
fight with other people

504
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,100
and start an affray

505
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,540
on the road?

506
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:36,900
Your attitude is good.

507
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,700
It will be easier to talk about it with you.

508
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,460
Second,

509
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,820
when the receiving regiment was held captive

510
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,260
at Zhangmu Train Station,

511
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,620
did you organize the mutiny of the new recruits

512
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,540
and

513
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,020
leave the Division?

514
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,660
We didn't.

515
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,380
We...

516
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,700
There was no mutiny. We were

517
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,780
organizing them to save our comrades-in-arms.

518
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,300
Did you do it or not?

519
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:58,980
No.

520
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,620
Yes.

521
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,780
It was our decision.

522
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,460
OK. Third,

523
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,420
did you steal some hand grenades

524
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,940
and tried to damage national facilities?

525
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,500
You've almost bombed the railway track,

526
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,940
right?

527
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:15,980
That's not right.

528
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,140
We wanted to help our division

529
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,380
win the battle.

530
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,860
That's why we wanted to bomb the railway track.

531
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,180
I didn't damage the railway.

532
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,940
I bombed a hole beside the railway track.

533
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,340
You have to understand that

534
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,340
Division 234 could win the battle

535
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,660
not because you did something to the train
or bombed the railway track.

536
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,780
Do you understand?

537
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,300
Sir,

538
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,540
what on earth do you want to say?

539
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,460
I have to tell you my attitude first.

540
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,420
You two are new recruits that I received.

541
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,500
You've passed the physical examination and political censor.

542
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,980
When the new recruits were on the road,

543
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,180
there was a drill.

544
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,180
We saw three problems

545
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:58,020
with you:

546
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,940
Fighting with other people;

547
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,820
Leaving the Division;

548
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,020
Stealing weapons

549
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,220
but failing to damage the railway.

550
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:08,900
Sir,

551
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,900
you are exaggerating it.

552
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,460
It was not at all...

553
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,900
Let me finish my words first.

554
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,260
Some cadres discovered

555
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,780
what you did at that time.

556
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,860
We knew part of the story after it happened.

557
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,940
Fortunately, we knew this early enough.

558
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,260
Everything was still in control.

559
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,700
Otherwise,

560
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,860
you might cause

561
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,700
immeasurable loss for the army.

562
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,700
Therefore,

563
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,340
The Military Affairs Unit have discussed about it.

564
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,740
We've reported it to the Regimental Party Committee and they have agreed.

565
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,260
We don't think you are suitable to stay in the army.

566
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,580
Now I inform you that

567

00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,860
please don't scare us.

00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,860
I can understand

00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,300
how you feel.

573
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,540

574
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,100
contact the Military Department of your hometown

575
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,140
as soon as possible.

576
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,300
We will tell them clearly

577
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,780
why we ask you to leave the army.

578
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,820
As to your files,

579
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,260
I will think about how to write about it.

580
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,260
Go back and pack up your belongings.

581
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,860
You don't have to participate

582
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,260
in the activities of the Company tomorrow.

583
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,620
Go to the Military Affairs Unit

584
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,100
to report for duty directly.

585
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,180
No!

586
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,500
I refuse!

587
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,580
Why do you ask me to leave?

588
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,220
What did I do? You are asking me to leave.

589
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,220
I won't leave!

590
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,900
Gu Yiye,

00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,380
This is a field force.

592
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,220
This is not the army compound!

593

You are from an army compound,
but you can't act unreasonably!

594
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,660
Song Jianshe,

595
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,620
were we wrong not to become captives?

596
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,700
The cadres knew it at that time.

597
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,060
We bombed the railway track

598
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,660

599
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,580

601
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,700
Now the drill is over.

602
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,580
There is a problem with that.

603
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,380
You want us to become the scapegoats.

604
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:52,820
Gao Liang,

605
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:53,740
don't mention other people.

606
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,580
Did I say anything wrong?

607
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,340
Didn't Lu Pingfan tell you that

608
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,780
it was risky to do so?

609
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,940
The investigation group contacted Lu Pingfan

610
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,580
and the new recruits who were present at that time.

611
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,900

The decision can't be changed in principle.

616

I'll leave then.

617

Do you think I enjoy being a solider?

618

Let me tell you,

619
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:18,740
the cadres are all very annoying.

620

Mr. Song,

626
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,660
is there a way

to change this decision?

628
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,500
That's impossible.

629
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,540

they really have to leave the army,

758
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,380
you should ask me to leave as well.

759
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,380
No.

Zhang Fei,

761
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,620
you are going too far.

While I'm here,

763
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,580
you shouldn't blame yourself.

Although you haven't become a cadre,

767
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,580
you've been assiduous

768
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,900
and bearing hardships without complaint for so many years.

769
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,540
You've cultivated so many new recruits.

770
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,420
You've never talked to the leaders for a personal reason.

771
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:50,820
What's the matter now?

772
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,220

773
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,700
You want to give up your career

774
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,100

776
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,620
How can you leave?

777
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,460

I'm willing...

783
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,380
I'm willing to

784
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,780
answer for every sentence I said.

785
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,620
I've asked my comrade-in-arms.

786
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,140
During the drill,

787

Xia Lin fired off a blind shell.

788
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,060

ending up being scolded to his face.

845

A government functionary should not do so.

00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,340

many of your peer student officers

860
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,980
had left.

861

while a new recruit can stand at most 40 minutes.

870
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,260
I think

871
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,940
he can stand over an hour.

877
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,380
He won't bring any more trouble to the army.

00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,580
is born to be a soldier.

880
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,220
It's reasonable to ask him to leave.

881
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,140
But if he stays in the army,

882
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,580
he will play an important role.

883
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,340
It's not for myself.

884
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,420
It's for the army.

885
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:23,740
If you want people

886
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,460
to think highly of this army,

887
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,180
it should not live in an old story.

888
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,500
There should be more soldiers with such quality.

889
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,420
I know student officers like you

890
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,620
always feel that indigenous officers like me

891
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,060

00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,060
people don't know

894
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:42,220
they have their own pride and prejudice.

895
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,540
