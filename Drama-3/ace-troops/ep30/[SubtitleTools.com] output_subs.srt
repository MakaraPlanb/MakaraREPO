00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:29,564
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:31,357 --> 00:00:32,901
EPISODE 9

3
00:00:37,572 --> 00:00:40,366
How did the ANSP team leader
escape through the prayer room?

4
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,328
There was a secret passage
to the exit on basement two.

5
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:46,498
A secret passage?

6
00:00:47,082 --> 00:00:48,249
No wonder

7
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:51,503
the old man and hall director
exchanged looks suspiciously.

8
00:00:52,545 --> 00:00:53,755
We should go.

9
00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:55,215
Follow me.

10
00:01:38,716 --> 00:01:40,009
If this button is pushed,

11
00:01:41,511 --> 00:01:43,513
the dorm will explode.

12
00:01:44,889 --> 00:01:45,890
Right?

13
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:52,814
You say you don't

14
00:01:54,941 --> 00:01:57,235
want to hurt anyone when you have this?

15
00:02:00,864 --> 00:02:02,532
I understand why you don't trust me.

16
00:02:05,618 --> 00:02:07,912
But that's for defending ourselves,
not for killing you.

17
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,291
Hundreds of soldiers are
surrounding this place.

18
00:02:12,584 --> 00:02:15,461
I needed to do something to protect
my team members as their leader.

19
00:02:20,466 --> 00:02:21,801
Stay away!

20
00:02:24,012 --> 00:02:26,514
-No!
-What if the soldiers break in?

21
00:02:29,309 --> 00:02:32,145
Will you still not use it then
since it's not for killing?

22
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:33,813
I told you.

23
00:02:35,231 --> 00:02:37,108
I don't want to hurt anyone in this dorm.

24
00:02:37,192 --> 00:02:38,735
Do you expect me to believe that?

25
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:42,655
Yes.

26
00:02:44,324 --> 00:02:46,534
After the cruel things I did to you,

27
00:02:47,702 --> 00:02:50,413
why would I lie to you
about getting out in nine days?

28
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:54,500
Everything I've done to you,
that's already too hard for me to bear.

29
00:02:56,211 --> 00:02:59,589
We're really going
to get out of here in nine days.

30
00:03:01,424 --> 00:03:02,425
So please

31
00:03:03,426 --> 00:03:05,595
-give that back to me.
-Don't come near.

32
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:07,305
Stay away.

33
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:13,228
Why? Why in nine days?

34
00:03:14,854 --> 00:03:16,773
Why not get out right now?

35
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,025
Why wait until nine days later?

36
00:03:28,034 --> 00:03:29,827
You're lying again, aren't you?

37
00:03:31,663 --> 00:03:33,248
You're lying again.

38
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,127
Everything you've told me was a lie.

39
00:03:43,466 --> 00:03:44,467
That's not true.

40
00:03:45,301 --> 00:03:47,220
Give that to me. It's dangerous.

41
00:04:01,651 --> 00:04:02,485
Don't--

42
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,790
Please.

43
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,334
Please believe me.

44
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:22,588
I don't want to make you suffer anymore.

45
00:04:42,775 --> 00:04:45,069
There's nothing
I can do for you but watch.

46
00:04:47,905 --> 00:04:49,991
And that's driving me crazy.

47
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:50,968
Comrade Kang Cheong-ya.

48
00:05:53,179 --> 00:05:54,430
It's this way.

49
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:01,062
Hey, student.

50
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:07,610
Tell the hall director

51
00:06:07,693 --> 00:06:09,612
to bring me some water.

52
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:11,656
Tell her.

53
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,533
Now.

54
00:06:15,493 --> 00:06:16,494
Gosh.

55
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,038
I'm parched.

56
00:06:19,122 --> 00:06:20,498
Give me some water.

57
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,668
Hey!

58
00:06:25,253 --> 00:06:26,254
Hey.

59
00:06:26,337 --> 00:06:28,047
Shut your trap, will you?

60
00:06:28,131 --> 00:06:29,340
I'm thirsty.

61
00:06:29,424 --> 00:06:30,883
I'm so thirsty.

62
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:31,801
Please.

63
00:06:32,885 --> 00:06:34,887
I'm so thirsty. Come on.

64
00:06:35,471 --> 00:06:36,431
Please.

65
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,225
Give me some water.

66
00:06:39,308 --> 00:06:40,601
Hey.

67
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:43,271
Just a cup of water.

68
00:06:43,354 --> 00:06:45,398
But you had some not long ago!

69
00:06:45,481 --> 00:06:46,941
I didn't get any.

70
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:49,235
And I'm all tied up.

71
00:06:49,986 --> 00:06:51,362
I feel so stifled.

72
00:06:51,446 --> 00:06:53,781
Come on. Just give me some water.

73
00:06:54,282 --> 00:06:56,200
Anyone wants to bring him water?

74
00:07:10,548 --> 00:07:11,757
What did you want to tell me?

75
00:07:12,341 --> 00:07:15,052
We have no time,
so I'll ask you straightforward.

76
00:07:15,136 --> 00:07:18,681
Did you really not know
Lim Soo-ho was hiding in the dorm?

77
00:07:19,557 --> 00:07:20,850
When you even bugged the dorm?

78
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:24,520
Did you help him hide

79
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:26,939
since you're on the same side?

80
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:35,114
On the same side?

81
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:39,160
Shut it before I rip you to shreds.

82
00:07:39,243 --> 00:07:40,828
I'm sick and tired

83
00:07:41,954 --> 00:07:43,414
of you people.

84
00:08:20,076 --> 00:08:22,036
I warned you not to do anything stupid

85
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:25,206
and that I'd not let it slide again.

86
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,624
What did I do?

87
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:31,462
How else did Eun Yeong-ro
find out about the detonator I had?

88
00:08:34,757 --> 00:08:37,009
I just tried to stop her
from trying to escape.

89
00:08:40,555 --> 00:08:44,475
I told her about the detonator in your
pocket to stop her from acting rashly!

90
00:08:46,686 --> 00:08:48,646
Shouldn't you ask me why
before hitting me?

91
00:08:56,153 --> 00:08:56,988
Sit.

92
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:35,026
You say they'll kill everyone here
including you and me in nine days?

93
00:09:37,737 --> 00:09:40,740
If you're trying to make me surrender,
you should stop here.

94
00:09:40,823 --> 00:09:41,657
Surrender?

95
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:46,203
You think they'll accept your surrender?

96
00:09:47,246 --> 00:09:51,250
They even play with the citizens' lives
to maintain their power.

97
00:09:51,334 --> 00:09:55,379
I can't let those bastards have their way.
Is that so hard to understand?

98
00:10:02,678 --> 00:10:04,722
The party considers the people
as its children.

99
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:07,224
They'd never abandon you?
You really think so?

100
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,936
A huge sum of money
must be at stake in this joint scheme.

101
00:10:12,104 --> 00:10:15,608
You think your party will give up
the money to save three spies?

102
00:10:16,192 --> 00:10:17,526
You really believe that?

103
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:28,746
You think you're safe since you have…

104
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,666
the ANSP director's daughter?

105
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,250
Wake up.

106
00:10:33,334 --> 00:10:36,921
I bet they'll try everything they can to
get her out of here before the election.

107
00:10:47,807 --> 00:10:50,101
Bring me proof that what you say is true.

108
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:52,395
Proof?

109
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:54,689
Tied up like this?

110
00:10:54,772 --> 00:10:57,108
Your subordinate will come back in later.

111
00:10:57,191 --> 00:11:00,736
Tell her to bring me proof
that I can trust.

112
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:06,659
Hard evidence that
our countries are scheming to kill us all.

113
00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:11,747
But if she brings it,

114
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:13,791
will you destroy that detonator

115
00:11:15,292 --> 00:11:16,544
and work with me?

116
00:11:19,672 --> 00:11:22,258
Are you willing to work with us
to get out of here alive?

117
00:11:28,097 --> 00:11:31,600
How could you be so stupid
to hide a gun in Dr. Kang's bag?

118
00:11:31,684 --> 00:11:35,521
They say those bastards won't
release her because of you!

119
00:11:35,604 --> 00:11:36,897
Apologize. Now.

120
00:11:38,607 --> 00:11:40,401
Don't do anything stupid again.

121
00:11:40,985 --> 00:11:43,779
And just come out
as soon as you deliver the supplies. Okay?

122
00:11:45,448 --> 00:11:46,365
Yes, sir.

123
00:11:47,116 --> 00:11:48,659
By the way, sir,

124
00:11:48,743 --> 00:11:51,245
seeing how he specifically asked for her,

125
00:11:51,328 --> 00:11:54,498
he must like her very much.

126
00:11:55,207 --> 00:11:56,751
-Is that so?
-Yes.

127
00:11:57,334 --> 00:11:59,420
Are you serious right now?

128
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,632
I stabbed them in the back
to let the SWAT team break in

129
00:12:04,216 --> 00:12:05,801
without knowing it was a lie.

130
00:12:05,885 --> 00:12:08,846
He might be asking for me
in order to get back at me.

131
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:09,764
Hey, look.

132
00:12:09,847 --> 00:12:12,016
You make it sound like we fooled you.

133
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:14,059
They're threatening to blow up the dorm!

134
00:12:14,143 --> 00:12:16,145
How can we send the SWAT team in?

135
00:12:16,228 --> 00:12:18,230
We must save the students!

136
00:12:25,321 --> 00:12:26,447
Go

137
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:30,576
tell Dr. Kang
that we'll save her at all costs

138
00:12:31,911 --> 00:12:34,330
and to have faith in me and hang in there.

139
00:12:35,456 --> 00:12:37,249
Only Dr. Kang?

140
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:43,380
-God damn it. Seriously…
-You understood, Jang, right?

141
00:12:43,464 --> 00:12:44,965
Get out. You don't have much time.

142
00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:47,593
-Now.
-You get out too.

143
00:12:47,676 --> 00:12:48,636
Wait for me.

144
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,348
God, my blood pressure again.

145
00:12:55,518 --> 00:12:58,521
The ANSP has gotten
the food and medical supplies

146
00:12:58,604 --> 00:13:01,982
the spies demanded
ready in front of their camp.

147
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:03,484
The supplies include

148
00:13:04,068 --> 00:13:05,736
ten boxes of cup noodles,

149
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,281
drugs for diabetes and blood pressure,
and some men's clothes.

150
00:13:09,365 --> 00:13:10,199
He's coming out!

151
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:12,451
Hey!

152
00:13:12,535 --> 00:13:13,661
Gyeong-hui!

153
00:13:15,955 --> 00:13:17,873
Can't you do your job right?

154
00:13:18,249 --> 00:13:20,584
How could you let
a stray dog waltz in here?

155
00:13:20,668 --> 00:13:21,502
I'm sorry, sir.

156
00:13:22,294 --> 00:13:23,295
Are you mad at me?

157
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:25,923
Because a stray dog like me is so polite?

158
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:28,300
Come on, Gyeong-hui. Be understanding.

159
00:13:28,884 --> 00:13:30,386
For old times' sake!

160
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,221
She's going in!

161
00:13:40,938 --> 00:13:43,649
Are the hostages safe? Is anyone injured?

162
00:13:43,732 --> 00:13:45,442
Who's in there other than the students?

163
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:50,197
In return for providing the food
and medical supplies the spies demanded,

164
00:13:50,281 --> 00:13:52,366
we, the ANSP,

165
00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:55,661
strongly urged them
to release the hostages safely.

166
00:13:55,744 --> 00:13:58,289
Do you have any contingency plans?

167
00:13:58,873 --> 00:14:01,333
<i>If the spies don't release
the hostages this time,</i>

168
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:05,462
<i>unfortunately, it might prolong
the hostage situation.</i>

169
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:08,549
<i>That's how we're looking at it. However--</i>

170
00:14:09,884 --> 00:14:11,844
It might prolong it?

171
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:15,556
They've already started putting on an act.

172
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:33,532
You're watching the news, right?
Listen carefully.

173
00:14:34,658 --> 00:14:36,118
In the people's eyes,

174
00:14:36,201 --> 00:14:38,996
<i>it must look like
you're making this drag on</i>

175
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:42,791
<i>and we're trying to break in
to take you down at any chance we get.</i>

176
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,461
And it must look like we're not able to

177
00:14:45,544 --> 00:14:47,880
because you might blow yourselves up!

178
00:14:47,963 --> 00:14:49,340
Killing all the hostages!

179
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,301
<i>So,</i>

180
00:14:52,384 --> 00:14:55,429
you can't release any of your hostages.

181
00:14:55,512 --> 00:14:57,264
Okay?

182
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,350
Wait.

183
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:01,435
And don't touch Dr. Kang.

184
00:15:02,186 --> 00:15:05,522
<i>Don't even step on her shadow. Okay?</i>

185
00:15:11,236 --> 00:15:12,571
I should get back down.

186
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:15,074
Comrade Lim Soo-ho.

187
00:15:21,413 --> 00:15:23,791
Hand the detonator over to me.

188
00:15:26,543 --> 00:15:31,048
-Pardon?
-You let a girl take it away from you.

189
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:33,759
How can I trust you with it?

190
00:15:38,847 --> 00:15:41,433
If you don't bring back
your revolutionary spirit now,

191
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,561
I will kill you myself.

192
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,376
Release the hostages.

193
00:16:08,502 --> 00:16:12,798
He thinks our revolutionary warriors are
his minions. We should teach him a lesson.

194
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,800
Don't you agree?

195
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:33,986
You bestowed men's clothes on us.

196
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:35,529
I'm forever grateful.

197
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:38,032
I'm so excited.

198
00:16:39,116 --> 00:16:41,618
Could I get changed right away?

199
00:16:43,412 --> 00:16:45,497
I told you to check for explosives first.

200
00:16:46,915 --> 00:16:48,584
I will, sir.

201
00:16:52,755 --> 00:16:55,883
Gosh, it's heavy.

202
00:16:58,469 --> 00:17:00,137
Damn it.

203
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,514
SWAT team, go in! Now!

204
00:17:03,307 --> 00:17:04,767
SWAT team, go in!

205
00:17:14,526 --> 00:17:16,737
Didn't I tell you it's most important

206
00:17:17,196 --> 00:17:19,114
to maintain mutual trust?

207
00:17:21,658 --> 00:17:24,119
I'm… I'm sorry.

208
00:17:24,203 --> 00:17:26,288
I had no other choice.

209
00:17:28,165 --> 00:17:31,376
But the SWAT team
didn't break in after all, did they?

210
00:17:32,461 --> 00:17:34,213
Leave this woman to me.

211
00:17:35,464 --> 00:17:36,924
Go upstairs with the supplies.

212
00:17:38,008 --> 00:17:39,009
Follow me with them.

213
00:17:39,093 --> 00:17:40,177
Yes, sir.

214
00:17:41,637 --> 00:17:42,513
All right.

215
00:17:43,013 --> 00:17:44,556
Here we go.

216
00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:48,268
Sir.

217
00:17:49,478 --> 00:17:52,397
You should tell me
before you make a deal with them.

218
00:17:52,481 --> 00:17:54,733
You're releasing 30 hostages, and what?

219
00:17:54,817 --> 00:17:56,819
Just ten boxes of cup noodles?

220
00:17:56,902 --> 00:17:59,404
-You're on the losing end.
-Gwang-tae.

221
00:18:02,116 --> 00:18:03,617
Just lie low.

222
00:18:13,127 --> 00:18:14,169
Follow me.

223
00:18:25,722 --> 00:18:26,890
Mr. Lee.

224
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:29,685
Mr. Lee.

225
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,812
Are you all right?

226
00:18:31,895 --> 00:18:34,314
Oh, no. What happened to your face?

227
00:18:36,567 --> 00:18:37,776
We don't have much time.

228
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,570
I'm fine.

229
00:18:40,737 --> 00:18:42,239
Don't worry, and just sit.

230
00:18:44,366 --> 00:18:45,200
Now.

231
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,343
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

232
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:06,930
Sir, It's a scoop.

233
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:09,308
I smell something fishy.

234
00:19:09,808 --> 00:19:11,810
That's not what I mean.

235
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:15,147
Something doesn't feel right here. Yes!

236
00:19:17,608 --> 00:19:19,443
I got to go! I'll call you later!

237
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:20,861
PAY PHONE

238
00:19:21,737 --> 00:19:23,030
Oh, my goodness!

239
00:19:26,074 --> 00:19:27,451
Food delivery!

240
00:19:28,035 --> 00:19:30,454
-Here!
-What took you so long?

241
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:32,497
-What's with you?
-I'm sorry.

242
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:34,374
Here's the <i>jjamppong.</i>

243
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,919
-Here are the <i>tangsuyuk</i> and <i>dumplings.</i>
-All right.

244
00:19:37,878 --> 00:19:39,129
Don't be late next time!

245
00:19:39,713 --> 00:19:42,174
-Where should I put them?
-There.

246
00:19:42,257 --> 00:19:43,842
-Here.
-Thank you.

247
00:19:57,022 --> 00:19:59,608
Mr. Nam. The food is here.

248
00:19:59,691 --> 00:20:00,651
Okay.

249
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:03,528
<i>The doctor is being held at the moment…</i>

250
00:20:03,612 --> 00:20:05,364
Damn it.

251
00:20:05,447 --> 00:20:07,991
It's like I'm locked up in prison.

252
00:20:08,075 --> 00:20:09,576
Hang in there, sir.

253
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,955
If the reporters see you,
they'll make a fuss about it.

254
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:15,415
"The administration's number two guy
is at the scene.

255
00:20:15,499 --> 00:20:17,376
it must be some political scheme."

256
00:20:17,459 --> 00:20:18,835
What?

257
00:20:19,503 --> 00:20:20,879
I'm sorry.

258
00:20:24,383 --> 00:20:25,550
Hey, wait!

259
00:20:25,634 --> 00:20:28,095
<i>…and in this crisis,
the ANSP's wise judgment</i>

260
00:20:28,178 --> 00:20:31,682
<i>and action is needed
more than ever at the scene.</i>

261
00:20:34,184 --> 00:20:36,436
Hey, where's the pickled radish?

262
00:20:38,021 --> 00:20:39,314
I'm sorry, sir.

263
00:20:39,398 --> 00:20:42,484
Look at this guy. Where's your head at?

264
00:20:43,527 --> 00:20:44,987
Enjoy!

265
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:48,824
<i>This is a scheme.</i>

266
00:20:49,408 --> 00:20:51,493
A joint scheme
for the presidential election.

267
00:20:52,703 --> 00:20:53,996
What?

268
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:56,540
But still, how could they shoot at you?

269
00:20:56,623 --> 00:20:58,834
Professor Han's case was also part of it.

270
00:20:59,418 --> 00:21:01,336
That's why they got us away from him.

271
00:21:01,962 --> 00:21:03,338
But he was killed,

272
00:21:03,922 --> 00:21:06,341
so this hostage situation
became their plan B.

273
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:08,885
They're using this…

274
00:21:11,221 --> 00:21:12,931
for the election?

275
00:21:14,725 --> 00:21:15,809
No way.

276
00:21:17,602 --> 00:21:21,273
They're not planning
to kill the students, are they?

277
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,860
Will you just pray they won't?

278
00:21:30,824 --> 00:21:33,660
What do I have to do then? Just tell me.

279
00:21:33,744 --> 00:21:35,704
For them to win the election
by a landslide,

280
00:21:35,787 --> 00:21:38,206
they'll try to kill everyone
including the hostages.

281
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,500
We need proof
that they're planning to do it.

282
00:21:41,126 --> 00:21:44,338
As a matter of fact,
Gal and I agreed to dig into it together.

283
00:21:44,629 --> 00:21:46,089
As soon as we get it, I'll have Gal--

284
00:21:46,173 --> 00:21:47,466
If you act rashly,

285
00:21:49,926 --> 00:21:51,303
both you and Gal will be killed.

286
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,889
Bring it to me once you get it.

287
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,393
What are you going to do in here?

288
00:22:09,404 --> 00:22:11,156
I'll demand more supplies tomorrow.

289
00:22:12,032 --> 00:22:13,533
I'll ask them to send you in again,

290
00:22:14,117 --> 00:22:16,078
so find it by tomorrow morning.

291
00:22:16,661 --> 00:22:18,038
But how can I…

292
00:22:31,134 --> 00:22:31,968
Wait.

293
00:22:33,637 --> 00:22:34,554
Are you two…

294
00:22:35,347 --> 00:22:38,141
We're both rats in a trap.
If we fight each other, we'll all die.

295
00:22:39,267 --> 00:22:40,602
We must get out alive.

296
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:44,398
Just a minute.

297
00:22:45,399 --> 00:22:47,359
Give us privacy just for a minute.

298
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:50,612
If you're done talking, come out.
Both of you.

299
00:22:51,863 --> 00:22:53,156
Comrade.

300
00:22:57,661 --> 00:22:58,745
She's my fiancée.

301
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,873
Is a minute too much to ask?

302
00:23:10,173 --> 00:23:11,216
Come out.

303
00:23:25,689 --> 00:23:26,773
So tell me.

304
00:23:26,857 --> 00:23:32,237
Exactly how many single women
are in the dorm at the moment?

305
00:23:33,155 --> 00:23:35,991
Exactly 56 single women.

306
00:23:37,659 --> 00:23:39,911
Dr. Kang's in there too, right?

307
00:23:40,495 --> 00:23:42,831
Oh, right. Dr. Kang is

308
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:44,458
also

309
00:23:45,584 --> 00:23:46,501
single.

310
00:23:47,252 --> 00:23:48,170
Is it possible

311
00:23:48,753 --> 00:23:51,923
that she's been married
and didn't tell us?

312
00:23:54,217 --> 00:23:56,178
Come on. No way.

313
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:00,390
I once asked her why she was still single.

314
00:24:00,474 --> 00:24:01,433
And?

315
00:24:05,145 --> 00:24:09,107
One day in winter, while she was hiking
in some snowy mountains,

316
00:24:09,191 --> 00:24:11,735
she slipped and hung
on the edge of a cliff.

317
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:15,071
<i>Just when she thought
she was going to die,</i>

318
00:24:15,155 --> 00:24:17,908
<i>some guy saved her.</i>

319
00:24:18,325 --> 00:24:20,785
<i>Without knowing his name or age,</i>

320
00:24:20,869 --> 00:24:24,998
she spent the night with him
in some cave and parted ways.

321
00:24:25,081 --> 00:24:28,001
Since then,
she's never been able to get over him.

322
00:24:29,794 --> 00:24:31,213
She said she was

323
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,091
waiting to meet him like some destiny.

324
00:24:36,134 --> 00:24:37,594
Oh, my goodness.

325
00:24:39,721 --> 00:24:41,890
It sounds like something
from a romance novel.

326
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,644
Did anything happen in that cave?

327
00:24:46,353 --> 00:24:47,270
Stop it.

328
00:24:48,897 --> 00:24:51,233
I didn't peg her as naive.

329
00:24:51,316 --> 00:24:53,777
That's what I thought too.

330
00:24:54,986 --> 00:24:57,781
So if we include Dr. Kang,

331
00:24:58,406 --> 00:24:59,574
it's 57, right?

332
00:25:01,243 --> 00:25:03,787
But they say the hostages are
unlikely to be released,

333
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:06,581
so don't worry about it, ma'am.

334
00:25:07,165 --> 00:25:08,208
Really?

335
00:25:09,251 --> 00:25:11,253
The hostages won't be released?

336
00:25:13,046 --> 00:25:14,714
But still,

337
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:16,299
you shouldn't be clapping.

338
00:25:19,803 --> 00:25:22,180
From now on,
30 of you who are to be released

339
00:25:22,264 --> 00:25:24,808
will get out of the dorm
with the ANSP agent.

340
00:25:28,937 --> 00:25:30,730
Go out one by one in order.

341
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,114
Follow me in order. Be careful.

342
00:25:53,378 --> 00:25:54,629
Keep your heads down.

343
00:26:14,024 --> 00:26:15,775
I need to go to the restroom!

344
00:27:13,249 --> 00:27:14,793
You have it easy, you bastard.

345
00:27:15,585 --> 00:27:18,546
Cleaned up with new clothes.

346
00:27:19,255 --> 00:27:21,091
Hey, you wear this.

347
00:27:21,174 --> 00:27:22,884
-No, give that to me.
-No.

348
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,844
Hey!

349
00:27:44,906 --> 00:27:45,782
Mr. Lee.

350
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:49,911
They say they'll leave here in nine days.

351
00:27:51,162 --> 00:27:53,456
Is that true?

352
00:27:54,749 --> 00:27:56,042
Soo-ho said that?

353
00:27:58,294 --> 00:27:59,963
Did he tell you that?

354
00:28:01,297 --> 00:28:02,298
Yes.

355
00:28:03,842 --> 00:28:05,552
He said they'll leave quietly.

356
00:28:06,553 --> 00:28:08,638
But why nine days later?

357
00:28:13,935 --> 00:28:15,895
Don't tell anyone

358
00:28:17,147 --> 00:28:18,857
what I'm about to tell you.

359
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,192
I told you!

360
00:28:23,111 --> 00:28:26,030
Where's the money bag?

361
00:28:26,114 --> 00:28:28,116
You think I'm crazy? Why would I tell you?

362
00:28:29,033 --> 00:28:31,161
I'll take that money with me
no matter what

363
00:28:31,578 --> 00:28:34,956
and give you your share. Just count on me.

364
00:28:37,584 --> 00:28:38,960
Don't touch me.

365
00:28:39,043 --> 00:28:40,378
What's your problem?

366
00:28:41,755 --> 00:28:43,548
We both were born to wrong parents.

367
00:28:43,631 --> 00:28:45,508
We should help each other!

368
00:28:47,385 --> 00:28:48,553
Stop!

369
00:28:50,263 --> 00:28:51,473
Damn it!

370
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,986
Yes, I'm uneducated and poor.

371
00:29:05,487 --> 00:29:07,238
I received nothing from my parents,

372
00:29:07,322 --> 00:29:09,616
except this body!

373
00:29:10,533 --> 00:29:12,410
But do you know how hard

374
00:29:12,494 --> 00:29:14,704
I'm trying to save my ill father?

375
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:19,292
You think I'm like you,
a leech living off his old father?

376
00:29:21,377 --> 00:29:22,712
You b****.

377
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,048
What do you know about me?

378
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:28,843
Who are you to judge me?

379
00:29:29,594 --> 00:29:33,306
Do you have any idea
what kind of man Kim Man-dong is?

380
00:29:42,023 --> 00:29:44,359
You communist bastard!

381
00:29:49,197 --> 00:29:51,449
You're dead meat.

382
00:29:59,374 --> 00:30:00,375
Stop.

383
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:02,293
I yield!

384
00:30:02,377 --> 00:30:05,129
Don't kill me. Please. I'm sorry.

385
00:30:05,672 --> 00:30:07,090
Please.

386
00:30:18,768 --> 00:30:21,437
I'll get back after washing up a little.

387
00:30:48,381 --> 00:30:49,382
What?

388
00:30:56,723 --> 00:30:57,932
Darn it.

389
00:31:13,573 --> 00:31:16,367
The ANSP agent, who went in with the food

390
00:31:16,451 --> 00:31:19,370
-and medical supplies… is coming out!
-She's out!

391
00:31:19,454 --> 00:31:20,747
-There she is!
-She's coming out!

392
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,789
The students are coming!

393
00:31:24,042 --> 00:31:25,043
Hurry up!

394
00:31:25,543 --> 00:31:27,045
Move faster!

395
00:31:27,879 --> 00:31:29,339
<i>Unlike the ANSP's predictions,</i>

396
00:31:29,422 --> 00:31:32,300
The Northern spies are
releasing some hostages…

397
00:31:32,383 --> 00:31:34,093
Those damn communists!

398
00:31:34,177 --> 00:31:36,471
What do we do, sir? What if they say

399
00:31:36,554 --> 00:31:38,514
there are only three spies in the dorm?

400
00:31:38,598 --> 00:31:39,974
What do you think?

401
00:31:40,058 --> 00:31:41,851
Take them to our interrogation room!

402
00:31:41,935 --> 00:31:44,354
Stop the reporters
and get them into the car!

403
00:31:44,437 --> 00:31:46,648
Hurry up! Hurry!

404
00:31:46,731 --> 00:31:49,108
-You take care of the reporters.
-Don't worry, sir.

405
00:31:49,192 --> 00:31:51,361
-Let's go, Seung-jun.
-Yes, sir.

406
00:32:01,579 --> 00:32:03,414
-Get them in the car!
-Yes, sir!

407
00:32:11,923 --> 00:32:12,757
Hurry!

408
00:32:41,953 --> 00:32:44,706
Are the hostages safe? Is anyone injured?

409
00:32:46,124 --> 00:32:49,293
Without giving in
to these evil communists,

410
00:32:49,377 --> 00:32:51,754
we sent in a negotiation expert

411
00:32:51,838 --> 00:32:54,090
and tenaciously convinced them.

412
00:32:54,382 --> 00:32:55,383
As a result,

413
00:32:55,466 --> 00:32:58,761
we accomplished
the release of tens of hostages today.

414
00:32:59,721 --> 00:33:00,805
As we speak,

415
00:33:00,888 --> 00:33:05,351
the released students are being taken
to the nearby hospital for check-ups.

416
00:33:05,935 --> 00:33:09,605
We'll do our best
for them to go back to their families.

417
00:33:10,815 --> 00:33:11,649
Thank you.

418
00:33:12,233 --> 00:33:14,652
-Thanks.
-Thanks to you, I got a scoop.

419
00:33:16,988 --> 00:33:18,740
What?

420
00:33:19,782 --> 00:33:20,825
What's that?

421
00:33:22,994 --> 00:33:25,121
What… What's going on?

422
00:33:25,747 --> 00:33:28,750
-Hey, just a while.
-What?

423
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:31,544
-I'm borrowing this for just a while.
-No, you can't!

424
00:33:31,627 --> 00:33:34,172
I'll pay you double later!

425
00:33:34,255 --> 00:33:37,133
-I'm sorry!
-Wait, sir!

426
00:33:37,842 --> 00:33:38,676
Hey!

427
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,094
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

428
00:33:40,178 --> 00:33:42,597
Didn't I make myself clear?

429
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,931
I told you not to do anything!

430
00:33:44,015 --> 00:33:46,809
Didn't I tell you
not to do anything stupid?

431
00:33:47,894 --> 00:33:50,772
All I did was go in and come out quietly.

432
00:33:52,982 --> 00:33:57,320
But you came out with the hostages!
Not just one but a lot of them!

433
00:33:58,738 --> 00:34:01,240
They told me to do it.
What, should I have said no?

434
00:34:02,158 --> 00:34:03,117
Wait a minute.

435
00:34:04,202 --> 00:34:06,496
As many as 30 hostages have been released.

436
00:34:08,081 --> 00:34:09,165
Aren't you happy?

437
00:34:12,835 --> 00:34:13,836
Of course I am!

438
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,046
I'm happy!

439
00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:17,215
I am! That's why I'm like this! Damn it.

440
00:34:18,424 --> 00:34:19,759
What are you looking at? Work!

441
00:34:21,302 --> 00:34:23,513
Get back to work, you idiots!

442
00:34:26,057 --> 00:34:27,809
You get out! Now!

443
00:34:28,392 --> 00:34:30,353
I don't want to see you.
Get out of my sight.

444
00:34:30,686 --> 00:34:33,481
Just go. Don't even say bye.
Just leave. Go!

445
00:34:34,065 --> 00:34:36,776
<i>I, An Gyeong-hui, and the ANSP</i>

446
00:34:37,568 --> 00:34:39,320
<i>will do our best.</i>

447
00:34:39,904 --> 00:34:42,615
<i>I solemnly swear it to the citizens.</i>

448
00:34:42,698 --> 00:34:44,909
When I was in elementary school, I drew

449
00:34:44,992 --> 00:34:47,120
a devil-looking Northern spy
and won an award.

450
00:34:47,703 --> 00:34:51,332
But I guess they're human after all,
seeing how they released 30 hostages.

451
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:03,845
What? The release of the hostages
was unlikely?

452
00:35:06,222 --> 00:35:07,807
So how many are left?

453
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,017
How many? Tell me!

454
00:35:10,101 --> 00:35:13,104
Ma'am, you can't sit down.

455
00:35:13,187 --> 00:35:15,314
The pins will hurt you.

456
00:35:17,567 --> 00:35:20,862
Ma'am, don't worry too much.

457
00:35:20,945 --> 00:35:22,989
How can I not worry right now?

458
00:35:23,656 --> 00:35:24,740
What if

459
00:35:25,241 --> 00:35:27,368
exactly 13 students are left?

460
00:35:27,451 --> 00:35:28,452
Then what?

461
00:35:30,997 --> 00:35:32,165
Ma'am.

462
00:35:36,377 --> 00:35:38,421
This is really

463
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,632
confidential information.

464
00:35:45,595 --> 00:35:49,015
According to my husband,
this hostage situation is

465
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:54,187
a scheme that the North and South
planned together.

466
00:35:55,855 --> 00:35:57,064
My goodness.

467
00:35:59,483 --> 00:36:00,318
The North and South?

468
00:36:02,403 --> 00:36:03,404
For the election?

469
00:36:03,487 --> 00:36:05,114
Yes.

470
00:36:06,908 --> 00:36:09,452
So I doubt they're really going

471
00:36:09,535 --> 00:36:12,455
to kill those college girls. Right?

472
00:36:13,706 --> 00:36:14,999
You're right.

473
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,127
-They won't, right?
-No.

474
00:36:23,299 --> 00:36:25,051
What about our Yeong-ro?

475
00:36:25,134 --> 00:36:26,802
Was she released too?

476
00:36:27,386 --> 00:36:29,513
Was Yeong-ro released too?

477
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,099
Well, I guess so.

478
00:36:32,892 --> 00:36:34,518
Anything else that's unusual?

479
00:36:35,895 --> 00:36:38,981
What? They shot at Gang-mu
to make him go back in?

480
00:36:39,607 --> 00:36:40,608
When?

481
00:36:40,691 --> 00:36:41,943
Okay, I'll be there.

482
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,278
I should go to the scene.

483
00:36:44,362 --> 00:36:46,489
Why? What's going on?

484
00:36:55,748 --> 00:36:57,708
Now that 30 of them have been released,

485
00:36:59,919 --> 00:37:02,463
27 are left in there.

486
00:37:06,217 --> 00:37:07,718
This is amazing.

487
00:37:08,302 --> 00:37:10,721
It's getting closer to 13.

488
00:37:17,353 --> 00:37:20,314
Lim Soo-ho is… How should I put it?

489
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,444
I know this since I used to live with him.

490
00:37:26,028 --> 00:37:28,948
I didn't get any killer or spy vibes
from him at all.

491
00:37:29,532 --> 00:37:32,660
-Rather, he was quite sweet.
-Oh, God.

492
00:37:33,244 --> 00:37:35,371
And he was quite thoughtful.

493
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:37,707
He released 30, and you're his fan now?

494
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,583
It's all your fault, Gwang-tae.

495
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:41,043
You suggested the blind date.

496
00:37:41,127 --> 00:37:43,462
Come on, you can't blame him for that.

497
00:37:43,546 --> 00:37:46,590
I mean, he didn't know Soo-ho was
a spy when he was setting us

498
00:37:46,674 --> 00:37:48,801
-up on the blind date.
-Jeez.

499
00:37:48,884 --> 00:37:51,387
Why are you taking his side?
Do you like him?

500
00:37:54,932 --> 00:37:55,766
What?

501
00:38:00,646 --> 00:38:03,441
Well, I… It's not that.

502
00:38:04,275 --> 00:38:06,694
-I just…
-Hey. Yoon Seol-hui.

503
00:38:07,653 --> 00:38:08,863
Don't tell me…

504
00:38:08,946 --> 00:38:11,115
Yes, you're right, Hye-ryeong.

505
00:38:12,533 --> 00:38:15,077
When I saw Seol-hui at the Open House,

506
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:17,413
she struck my heart

507
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:20,124
like it was destiny.

508
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,544
Struck your heart?
What is she, Cupid's Arrow?

509
00:38:23,627 --> 00:38:26,589
What a sly bastard. That's not love.
You're just after her money.

510
00:38:26,672 --> 00:38:28,799
How could you say that?

511
00:38:28,883 --> 00:38:32,720
Seol-hui is my muse and sun.
You know nothing.

512
00:38:34,847 --> 00:38:35,931
Seol-hui.

513
00:38:37,516 --> 00:38:39,101
Will you marry me?

514
00:38:40,644 --> 00:38:42,188
I'll protect you

515
00:38:43,189 --> 00:38:44,940
for the rest of my life.

516
00:38:46,525 --> 00:38:47,651
Hey!

517
00:38:49,403 --> 00:38:50,571
Having fun?

518
00:38:56,952 --> 00:38:59,205
Look at her. She's actually happy.

519
00:38:59,955 --> 00:39:01,540
So why did you two-time him

520
00:39:01,624 --> 00:39:03,667
when you weren't even interested in him?

521
00:39:06,587 --> 00:39:08,464
What's a proposal without a ring?

522
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:10,633
You're right. What a shame.

523
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:12,551
It happens only once in your life!

524
00:39:12,635 --> 00:39:14,804
By the way, have you even kissed?

525
00:39:14,887 --> 00:39:16,180
-Stop that!
-Keep it down.

526
00:39:20,309 --> 00:39:21,394
<i>Are you saying</i>

527
00:39:21,477 --> 00:39:23,771
the presidential election is in nine days,

528
00:39:23,854 --> 00:39:25,940
and for my dad to win the election,

529
00:39:26,357 --> 00:39:29,151
we might all be killed?

530
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:34,240
I can't say for sure,
but we can't rule out that possibility.

531
00:39:47,336 --> 00:39:48,254
Sir.

532
00:39:49,547 --> 00:39:51,590
How about you use me?

533
00:39:53,467 --> 00:39:54,343
Use you?

534
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:02,101
Then before that,

535
00:40:03,018 --> 00:40:04,603
there's something you need to know.

536
00:40:07,523 --> 00:40:09,275
I know it's hard to believe,

537
00:40:09,859 --> 00:40:12,778
but the doctor is also a Northern spy.

538
00:40:15,573 --> 00:40:16,615
The doctor?

539
00:40:17,867 --> 00:40:20,369
-Dr. Kang is?
-Doctor.

540
00:40:20,453 --> 00:40:22,872
-She's in pain.
-Let me see.

541
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:26,375
Where does it hurt?

542
00:40:53,611 --> 00:40:55,779
Yes, sir. It's me.

543
00:40:56,989 --> 00:40:59,408
I hope you and I will watch

544
00:40:59,783 --> 00:41:04,872
the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games
next year side by side.

545
00:41:06,749 --> 00:41:09,877
Why were the hostages already released?

546
00:41:10,544 --> 00:41:11,545
Sir.

547
00:41:11,629 --> 00:41:15,341
I swear those 30 hostages
were released under my orders.

548
00:41:15,424 --> 00:41:17,760
I'm keeping them under control.

549
00:41:17,843 --> 00:41:19,261
So don't worry, sir.

550
00:41:19,345 --> 00:41:22,389
I swear on my life I will get my job done
so that I'll be able

551
00:41:22,473 --> 00:41:25,267
to watch the opening ceremony
with you next year, sir.

552
00:41:57,049 --> 00:42:00,427
<i>You bastard!
I told you not to release the hostages!</i>

553
00:42:00,511 --> 00:42:01,929
<i>And you released 30 of them?</i>

554
00:42:02,012 --> 00:42:04,390
I never said I'd follow your orders.

555
00:42:06,475 --> 00:42:08,811
You ignorant, fearless fool.

556
00:42:09,562 --> 00:42:10,771
Do you know who I am?

557
00:42:12,398 --> 00:42:14,233
I don't care, but what's your plan?

558
00:42:15,734 --> 00:42:18,070
You guaranteed
our safe return to the North.

559
00:42:18,362 --> 00:42:22,074
Tell me how you will do that in detail.

560
00:42:22,658 --> 00:42:24,368
When I, Nam Tae-il, say

561
00:42:24,451 --> 00:42:27,538
I'll send you back,
I'll make it happen no matter what!

562
00:42:27,621 --> 00:42:29,290
I don't believe you

563
00:42:30,291 --> 00:42:32,585
and what you said
about sending us back to the North.

564
00:42:33,252 --> 00:42:35,921
Look. The day before the election,

565
00:42:36,005 --> 00:42:37,881
after we rescue all the hostages,

566
00:42:37,965 --> 00:42:41,468
we'll announce that we've killed
all of you. That's the plan!

567
00:42:41,552 --> 00:42:42,636
Kill all of us?

568
00:42:43,887 --> 00:42:45,055
You're going to kill us?

569
00:42:45,848 --> 00:42:48,434
No, we'll fake it.

570
00:42:48,517 --> 00:42:49,935
<i>You agreed to it.</i>

571
00:42:50,561 --> 00:42:51,937
We're just three,

572
00:42:52,521 --> 00:42:54,440
but you'll announce you killed seven?

573
00:42:54,523 --> 00:42:55,983
We'll bring some bodies,

574
00:42:56,066 --> 00:42:58,402
display them with your clothes,

575
00:42:58,485 --> 00:43:01,739
<i>and hide you guys away. No one will know.</i>

576
00:43:03,616 --> 00:43:05,117
<i>If you want to go back alive,</i>

577
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,660
just do as I say.

578
00:43:06,744 --> 00:43:09,747
<i>If you don't,
you can just forget about negotiation.</i>

579
00:43:11,457 --> 00:43:15,210
We have an astronomical amount
of money in our hands.

580
00:43:15,878 --> 00:43:20,424
<i>So much money that the North won't
complain even if we end up killing you!</i>

581
00:43:45,741 --> 00:43:48,369
Your lives are nothing
in front of that money.

582
00:43:48,452 --> 00:43:50,079
Maybe I'll just go in and kill you.

583
00:43:51,163 --> 00:43:52,623
Mr. Eun. Why are you back…

584
00:43:53,916 --> 00:43:55,459
Did you have them shoot at Gang-mu?

585
00:43:56,377 --> 00:43:59,171
How will you explain
once the situation is over?

586
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:03,926
Explain?

587
00:44:05,552 --> 00:44:06,470
Do I have to?

588
00:44:09,098 --> 00:44:10,766
Don't you know what he's like?

589
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:12,685
You know he won't just let it go.

590
00:44:12,768 --> 00:44:14,603
His colleagues shot at him, so I'm sure

591
00:44:14,687 --> 00:44:16,814
he found out it's a scheme
for the election.

592
00:44:16,897 --> 00:44:19,775
You think he'll sit back
and do nothing in there?

593
00:44:19,983 --> 00:44:22,444
Mr. Eun's right. He will never let it go.

594
00:44:23,404 --> 00:44:25,239
We'll make him do nothing.

595
00:44:27,032 --> 00:44:29,743
We can just make him stay there forever.

596
00:44:30,744 --> 00:44:32,246
Stay there forever?

597
00:44:33,831 --> 00:44:35,833
Are you saying you'll kill him?

598
00:44:38,168 --> 00:44:39,336
Of course.

599
00:44:40,295 --> 00:44:43,173
He's a troublemaker.
We'll be better off with him dead.

600
00:44:43,257 --> 00:44:44,591
<i>If we say he died</i>

601
00:44:44,675 --> 00:44:45,968
trying to save the students,

602
00:44:46,051 --> 00:44:48,053
it'll improve our agency's image too.

603
00:44:48,137 --> 00:44:49,221
What the hell?

604
00:44:49,304 --> 00:44:50,681
<i>Be honest with me.</i>

605
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:53,267
Are you willing to kill the students too?

606
00:44:54,977 --> 00:44:58,939
We need to make our boss
win the election for him to attend

607
00:44:59,148 --> 00:45:02,359
the opening ceremony
of the Olympic Games as he wishes.

608
00:45:02,443 --> 00:45:04,194
We're at such a crucial crossroads.

609
00:45:04,528 --> 00:45:06,113
The girls' lives are not important.

610
00:45:06,196 --> 00:45:09,074
If there comes a situation
where we have to kill them,

611
00:45:09,158 --> 00:45:10,868
we'll just rescue your daughter--

612
00:45:10,951 --> 00:45:15,080
Rescuing only my daughter
while all of the press is here?

613
00:45:15,748 --> 00:45:18,417
Letting all the people watch it?

614
00:45:18,667 --> 00:45:20,586
Did you forget about the agreement?

615
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:25,090
<i>We agreed to killing all the spies</i>

616
00:45:25,174 --> 00:45:27,885
and saving the hostages. Right?

617
00:45:28,093 --> 00:45:30,220
What I'm saying is,
depending on the situation--

618
00:45:30,304 --> 00:45:31,972
Even still!

619
00:45:32,055 --> 00:45:35,559
We must save all of the students.

620
00:45:36,477 --> 00:45:38,145
Including my daughter.

621
00:45:47,404 --> 00:45:48,697
Take care, sir.

622
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:54,703
That hypocritical bastard.

623
00:45:55,287 --> 00:45:56,413
Isn't he?

624
00:45:57,039 --> 00:45:59,082
He even sent his son to the front lines

625
00:45:59,166 --> 00:46:01,752
to remain in his position as director.

626
00:46:02,002 --> 00:46:05,631
If you think about it,
it's his fault his son died!

627
00:46:06,215 --> 00:46:07,174
Hey.

628
00:46:07,257 --> 00:46:10,010
If the election goes wrong,

629
00:46:10,177 --> 00:46:13,388
he'll bitterly regret
not having killed the students!

630
00:46:15,849 --> 00:46:16,975
Then,

631
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:18,769
depending on the situation,

632
00:46:20,145 --> 00:46:21,897
might we end up killing the students?

633
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,820
You are right, sir.

634
00:46:30,656 --> 00:46:32,324
"You are right, sir"?

635
00:46:33,784 --> 00:46:35,869
These goddamn bastards.

636
00:46:52,761 --> 00:46:54,012
Hurry up!

637
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:05,357
Hey, take them inside.

638
00:47:06,817 --> 00:47:08,235
Keep in line.

639
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:10,279
<i>Just like those released earlier,</i>

640
00:47:10,362 --> 00:47:12,614
have all of them sign the NDA
saying they'll stay quiet.

641
00:47:14,283 --> 00:47:16,159
Scare them a little bit

642
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:17,911
and send them to our hospital.

643
00:47:19,288 --> 00:47:22,374
And make sure
no reporters are on your tail.

644
00:47:25,919 --> 00:47:27,296
They arrived with no problem.

645
00:47:27,379 --> 00:47:28,714
So don't worry, sir.

646
00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:31,091
-A cigarette.
-Pardon?

647
00:47:31,174 --> 00:47:32,175
Yes, sir.

648
00:47:35,304 --> 00:47:37,306
Why are you carrying a bug detector?

649
00:47:37,806 --> 00:47:39,683
What? What's going on?

650
00:47:52,195 --> 00:47:53,196
Me?

651
00:48:00,454 --> 00:48:01,955
Mr. Nam. A bug!

652
00:48:04,041 --> 00:48:06,460
Who the hell planted this?

653
00:48:10,923 --> 00:48:12,007
I'm sorry.

654
00:48:12,883 --> 00:48:13,717
The delivery guy.

655
00:48:14,885 --> 00:48:16,887
Why can't we go in there?

656
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:18,847
-We can't!
-My kid's in there!

657
00:48:18,931 --> 00:48:21,642
-We need to go in!
-What's going on?

658
00:48:21,725 --> 00:48:23,393
-What's this?
-What's going on?

659
00:48:23,477 --> 00:48:24,937
-What's this?
-Coming through.

660
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:26,772
Make way, please.

661
00:48:26,855 --> 00:48:28,732
What? What's going on?

662
00:48:28,815 --> 00:48:31,234
I came to pick up the bowls.

663
00:48:31,568 --> 00:48:33,612
-Let him pass.
-Let him pass!

664
00:48:34,321 --> 00:48:36,156
<i>What, are you going to kill him?</i>

665
00:48:36,907 --> 00:48:38,325
<i>Of course.</i>

666
00:48:38,408 --> 00:48:40,410
<i>Are you willing to kill the students too?</i>

667
00:48:40,494 --> 00:48:41,995
<i>The girls' lives are not important.</i>

668
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,748
<i>If the election goes wrong,</i>

669
00:48:45,332 --> 00:48:47,918
<i>he'll bitterly regret
not having killed the students!</i>

670
00:48:49,002 --> 00:48:50,963
We need to send this into the dorm.

671
00:48:51,546 --> 00:48:52,714
And if it's revealed--

672
00:48:52,798 --> 00:48:55,425
Wait. You'll give it to the spies?

673
00:49:48,103 --> 00:49:50,272
What's the emergency frequency
you and your fiancée use?

674
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:55,152
What's the rush?
You gave her until tomorrow morning.

675
00:49:55,235 --> 00:49:56,445
We're running out of time.

676
00:49:57,612 --> 00:50:00,115
I need to see
if it's possible to get the proof.

677
00:50:01,575 --> 00:50:02,826
What's the frequency?

678
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,043
It's 44.

679
00:50:24,222 --> 00:50:25,182
Han-na.

680
00:50:26,183 --> 00:50:27,184
<i>Han-na, do you hear me?</i>

681
00:50:30,353 --> 00:50:32,397
Mr. Lee? What's going on?

682
00:50:32,981 --> 00:50:33,940
Did you get the proof?

683
00:50:34,649 --> 00:50:35,776
Yes, I got it.

684
00:50:39,237 --> 00:50:41,114
We found the delivery bike.

685
00:50:43,408 --> 00:50:44,576
Damn it.

686
00:50:50,332 --> 00:50:51,374
Damn it.

687
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:00,425
I filmed Tae-il
and the released hostages being taken.

688
00:51:00,967 --> 00:51:03,053
-Give me a gun.
-Here, sir.

689
00:51:17,609 --> 00:51:18,985
You son of a b****.

690
00:51:20,779 --> 00:51:22,656
<i>I went easy on you for old times' sake,</i>

691
00:51:22,864 --> 00:51:24,449
and you betrayed me?

692
00:51:27,661 --> 00:51:29,996
Come on. What's wrong, sir?

693
00:51:30,247 --> 00:51:31,581
What's this about?

694
00:51:31,665 --> 00:51:33,583
Why are you with this bastard?

695
00:51:34,167 --> 00:51:35,335
<i>Are you working with him?</i>

696
00:51:35,418 --> 00:51:37,546
<i>-What are you talking about?
-Hey!</i>

697
00:51:38,839 --> 00:51:40,841
<i>-Take her too.
-Yes, sir.</i>

698
00:51:42,092 --> 00:51:43,635
What are you doing? Let go of me!

699
00:51:43,718 --> 00:51:46,012
We found a bug in the camp.

700
00:51:46,096 --> 00:51:49,015
-Let go!
-What are you waiting for? Get out.

701
00:51:49,099 --> 00:51:50,183
Stay still.

702
00:51:50,767 --> 00:51:52,686
<i>-Get out!
-If you take me,</i>

703
00:51:52,769 --> 00:51:57,190
<i>my company won't just sit still.
This is suppressing free speech!</i>

704
00:51:59,651 --> 00:52:01,027
Han-na must've been caught.

705
00:52:02,904 --> 00:52:04,739
She's in danger because of you!

706
00:52:06,533 --> 00:52:07,701
Sit.

707
00:52:08,577 --> 00:52:10,912
Proof? What's the use of goddamn proof?

708
00:52:10,996 --> 00:52:14,082
You know that they'll kill us all
nine days later.

709
00:52:14,166 --> 00:52:15,500
You know they will.

710
00:52:20,088 --> 00:52:21,214
Shut up.

711
00:52:21,298 --> 00:52:24,718
The party guaranteed the safe return
to the North of all three of us.

712
00:52:27,053 --> 00:52:28,555
Do you still not get it?

713
00:52:29,556 --> 00:52:31,141
Are you that stupid?

714
00:52:32,017 --> 00:52:34,978
Right. I heard
you told Yeong-ro you'll leave

715
00:52:35,437 --> 00:52:36,605
nine days later.

716
00:52:37,439 --> 00:52:39,566
She asked why nine days later,

717
00:52:40,066 --> 00:52:42,694
so I told her all this is
a scheme for the election.

718
00:52:43,904 --> 00:52:46,198
That her dad might kill all the hostages.

719
00:52:46,281 --> 00:52:48,491
-You told her?
-What?

720
00:52:49,075 --> 00:52:50,327
You feel bad for her?

721
00:52:50,744 --> 00:52:52,454
On top of her brother's death,

722
00:52:52,537 --> 00:52:56,875
she found out that her dad might kill
all her friends. She must be going crazy.

723
00:52:57,792 --> 00:53:00,420
She was already blaming herself for this.

724
00:53:01,087 --> 00:53:02,672
She must just want to die.

725
00:53:03,798 --> 00:53:04,966
You bastard.

726
00:53:10,764 --> 00:53:11,973
It's hard, isn't it?

727
00:53:13,642 --> 00:53:15,143
I'm sure it's hard for you too.

728
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:18,647
Because you love Yeong-ro.

729
00:53:24,819 --> 00:53:25,946
Shut up.

730
00:53:26,029 --> 00:53:27,697
You think I'm a turncoat?

731
00:53:27,781 --> 00:53:29,658
Does loving the girl who saved you
make you a turncoat?

732
00:53:31,326 --> 00:53:34,454
Your party traded
their loyal agents for money.

733
00:53:36,665 --> 00:53:37,791
What about them?

734
00:53:58,979 --> 00:54:00,605
You're the ANSP team leader.

735
00:54:06,278 --> 00:54:10,282
The ANSP frames and kills those who
fight against the tyranny of the regime.

736
00:54:14,452 --> 00:54:15,954
You're the regime's hounds

737
00:54:16,371 --> 00:54:19,499
that trample on innocent people's lives
to make the security state.

738
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:23,044
That's what the ANSP is.

739
00:54:24,337 --> 00:54:27,132
And you're their agent.
You have no right to blame me.

740
00:54:34,472 --> 00:54:36,975
In the end, they're all the same.

741
00:54:37,767 --> 00:54:39,477
On the pretext of repatriation,

742
00:54:39,561 --> 00:54:42,063
the North deceived
countless Korean-Japanese

743
00:54:42,147 --> 00:54:44,316
and trampled on their lives.

744
00:54:46,067 --> 00:54:48,653
The South made the security state.

745
00:55:01,583 --> 00:55:02,751
Lim Soo-ho.

746
00:55:07,255 --> 00:55:09,007
You must wake up now.

747
00:55:10,592 --> 00:55:12,469
Lives of mere pawns like us…

748
00:55:12,969 --> 00:55:14,220
-We must--
-No.

749
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:17,682
"We"?

750
00:55:20,852 --> 00:55:22,354
You and I are enemies.

751
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,751
Would you like some?

752
00:55:45,335 --> 00:55:46,836
I'm not hungry.

753
00:55:48,129 --> 00:55:51,174
Didn't you say you'll rip me to shreds?

754
00:55:54,969 --> 00:55:58,306
I said some harsh words… I admit it.

755
00:56:01,601 --> 00:56:02,811
How did you find out?

756
00:56:03,853 --> 00:56:05,438
The room inside your office.

757
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:10,568
It's quite impressive.

758
00:56:16,199 --> 00:56:17,325
Please keep it

759
00:56:18,535 --> 00:56:19,536
from the students.

760
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,121
Of course.

761
00:56:22,038 --> 00:56:24,541
You work for my agency after all.

762
00:56:26,292 --> 00:56:28,628
How could a mere agent like me

763
00:56:28,711 --> 00:56:30,588
blow your cover?

764
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:33,675
We're on the same side.

765
00:56:36,177 --> 00:56:37,345
Mr. Lee.

766
00:56:37,429 --> 00:56:40,140
Since both of our lives
are in their hands,

767
00:56:40,223 --> 00:56:41,724
let me tell you something.

768
00:56:42,809 --> 00:56:45,603
Though I yielded to their power
since I'm weak,

769
00:56:46,104 --> 00:56:49,983
I still think they're evil people who
frame the innocent to climb the ladder.

770
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:51,693
I've never…

771
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,363
sold my students out to them.

772
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:01,661
Then,

773
00:57:03,371 --> 00:57:04,789
Let's save the students…

774
00:57:06,833 --> 00:57:07,834
together.

775
00:57:16,301 --> 00:57:17,343
Save?

776
00:57:23,516 --> 00:57:24,350
Hey.

777
00:57:25,059 --> 00:57:26,352
Go back to where you were.

778
00:57:41,659 --> 00:57:43,453
<i>I didn't plant the bug!</i>

779
00:57:44,037 --> 00:57:46,706
So how can I have any tape to give you?

780
00:57:47,832 --> 00:57:49,000
When you

781
00:57:49,459 --> 00:57:51,211
disguised yourself as a delivery guy

782
00:57:51,711 --> 00:57:55,423
and came in to film Mr. Nam with this,

783
00:57:56,216 --> 00:57:58,426
you planted the bug, you bastard!

784
00:58:01,095 --> 00:58:03,056
Damn.

785
00:58:04,474 --> 00:58:08,520
If I'd known this would happen,
I would've just planted my bug.

786
00:58:09,103 --> 00:58:10,480
COSMOS TOYS

787
00:58:11,439 --> 00:58:12,440
Let's get to work.

788
00:58:17,237 --> 00:58:19,155
Dong-jae. Oh Dong-jae!

789
00:58:19,739 --> 00:58:21,699
Open this! Come on!

790
00:58:21,783 --> 00:58:23,493
Open up!

791
00:58:25,495 --> 00:58:26,704
Open it!

792
01:00:37,043 --> 01:00:39,045
Comrade Joo. It's time to patrol.

793
01:00:39,128 --> 01:00:42,006
<i>It was "Bimok,"
so beautiful that it makes you sad.</i>

794
01:00:42,632 --> 01:00:45,259
<i>On a sunny and weedy corner
of a mountain foot,</i>

795
01:00:45,802 --> 01:00:48,805
<i>there was a wooden cross
on a nameless soldier's grave.</i>

796
01:00:48,888 --> 01:00:50,765
<i>And the song was inspired--</i>

797
01:00:57,021 --> 01:00:57,855
Polka Dot.

798
01:01:02,527 --> 01:01:05,571
You're quite a good singer. Sing it again.

799
01:01:07,073 --> 01:01:08,157
Look.

800
01:01:08,408 --> 01:01:10,827
My name is Ko Hye-ryeong, not Polka Dot.

801
01:01:11,661 --> 01:01:14,205
Besides, I don't sing
without any accompaniment.

802
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:16,916
-I'm Hosu's Maria Callas.
-Maria Callas!

803
01:01:17,959 --> 01:01:19,460
Is anyone willing

804
01:01:19,544 --> 01:01:21,587
to play piano for Hye-ryeong?

805
01:01:23,131 --> 01:01:24,716
You're good at it.

806
01:01:25,508 --> 01:01:27,176
I'll play it for you.

807
01:01:35,101 --> 01:01:39,856
<i>The cannon and gun smoke
swept the deep vale</i>

808
01:01:40,565 --> 01:01:43,109
<i>At the sunny place…</i>

809
01:01:43,192 --> 01:01:45,069
I don't think it'll work.

810
01:01:46,654 --> 01:01:49,323
But that's the safest place to hide.

811
01:01:50,616 --> 01:01:53,286
I doubt Yeong-ro will tell them easily.

812
01:01:54,036 --> 01:01:56,247
She's even hiding that
she's the ANSP director's daughter.

813
01:01:57,999 --> 01:02:00,126
This is a scheme for the election!

814
01:02:01,127 --> 01:02:03,129
How long will you dance
to the ANSP's tune?

815
01:02:08,968 --> 01:02:11,846
How on earth will you lose Kang Cheong-ya?

816
01:02:18,394 --> 01:02:20,772
<i>-There has been
-There has been</i>

817
01:02:20,855 --> 01:02:25,651
<i>-Moss at every joint and frown
-Moss at every joint and frown</i>

818
01:02:30,114 --> 01:02:31,240
Quiet!

819
01:02:38,831 --> 01:02:41,501
Well, what about the second verse?

820
01:03:09,403 --> 01:03:10,780
STUDENT HEAD OF DORM

821
01:03:16,077 --> 01:03:18,412
Excuse me. I'm sorry,

822
01:03:19,038 --> 01:03:20,373
but can I go to the restroom?

823
01:03:20,957 --> 01:03:22,041
I can't hold it.

824
01:03:22,124 --> 01:03:23,459
Lie down.

825
01:03:37,515 --> 01:03:38,641
I need to go to the restroom.

826
01:03:46,899 --> 01:03:48,734
Those who need to go, come all at once.

827
01:03:48,818 --> 01:03:50,528
This is the last time.

828
01:04:31,319 --> 01:04:32,403
Hey, cadet.

829
01:04:36,782 --> 01:04:37,909
We'll escape tomorrow.

830
01:04:38,701 --> 01:04:40,119
The hall director knows it.

831
01:04:40,202 --> 01:04:43,706
Joo, the one who took them
to the restroom. You take care of him.

832
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:45,666
Us?

833
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:46,626
Got it?

834
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:49,253
Go.

835
01:05:12,818 --> 01:05:14,862
8 DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION

836
01:05:50,314 --> 01:05:51,440
What are you doing?

837
01:05:52,775 --> 01:05:54,694
For them to keep fit,

838
01:05:55,653 --> 01:05:56,904
they should do this at least.

839
01:05:57,530 --> 01:05:58,572
Everyone sit.

840
01:05:58,656 --> 01:06:00,241
We're not livestock!

841
01:06:00,449 --> 01:06:02,743
You keep us here
without letting us wash up.

842
01:06:02,827 --> 01:06:04,286
This is a human rights abuse!

843
01:06:05,287 --> 01:06:06,414
For days,

844
01:06:07,123 --> 01:06:08,666
we haven't even brushed our teeth.

845
01:06:10,543 --> 01:06:12,128
It's hard to sleep here,

846
01:06:12,211 --> 01:06:13,963
but what's worse is the smell.

847
01:06:14,922 --> 01:06:15,965
Can we wash up?

848
01:06:16,924 --> 01:06:19,510
I've never spent four days
without brushing my teeth.

849
01:06:20,261 --> 01:06:21,971
-Please.
-Seriously.

850
01:06:22,054 --> 01:06:23,931
-Just this once.
-Please.

851
01:06:24,015 --> 01:06:26,267
-I feel so itchy.
-I can't take it anymore.

852
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:28,269
-Please.
-I'll be obedient.

853
01:06:28,352 --> 01:06:30,604
-Please.
-Let us wash up.

854
01:06:30,688 --> 01:06:32,648
-I feel so itchy.
-Please.

855
01:06:32,732 --> 01:06:35,317
We'll feel better
if you let us wash our faces.

856
01:06:35,985 --> 01:06:38,404
You can let us do that much, right?

857
01:06:38,487 --> 01:06:40,156
Are you out of your mind, you brats?

858
01:06:47,121 --> 01:06:47,955
Fine.

859
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:50,458
Ten people at a time.

860
01:06:51,167 --> 01:06:53,419
Do anything funny,
and the rest will get hurt.

861
01:06:54,211 --> 01:06:55,755
Our basins are in our rooms.

862
01:06:55,838 --> 01:06:57,757
Can we stop by our rooms?

863
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:00,009
But don't go above the second floor.

864
01:07:01,427 --> 01:07:02,636
First group of ten.

865
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,138
-Me!
-Me!

866
01:07:04,221 --> 01:07:05,723
-Me first!
-Me first!

867
01:07:05,806 --> 01:07:07,183
-Me first!
-Me first!

868
01:07:07,266 --> 01:07:09,310
-Me!
-Me!

869
01:07:09,393 --> 01:07:11,520
-Me first!
-Me first!

870
01:07:11,604 --> 01:07:12,855
Stand in a line in front of me.

871
01:07:15,441 --> 01:07:16,734
-Move.
-Number!

872
01:07:17,985 --> 01:07:19,487
Call out numbers!

873
01:07:20,029 --> 01:07:21,030
One.

874
01:07:21,697 --> 01:07:23,074
-Two.
-Three.

875
01:07:23,491 --> 01:07:24,909
-Four.
-Five.

876
01:07:29,705 --> 01:07:32,583
-Why are we running?
-Ko Hye-ryeong!

877
01:07:33,501 --> 01:07:36,212
-Let's go to our room on the 3rd floor.
-What? But…

878
01:07:36,295 --> 01:07:37,963
I forgot where I put my toothbrush.

879
01:07:38,047 --> 01:07:41,258
It's okay. I have a new one,
so don't worry. Let's go.

880
01:07:55,189 --> 01:07:56,107
Well,

881
01:07:57,191 --> 01:08:00,820
my room's next to the washing room.
Can I stop by for a second?

882
01:08:01,987 --> 01:08:03,864
You must stay on the second floor.

883
01:08:08,119 --> 01:08:10,246
I'm not a student here,

884
01:08:10,621 --> 01:08:13,290
so I have no one to borrow anything from.

885
01:08:18,754 --> 01:08:19,964
Where's your room?

886
01:08:21,966 --> 01:08:23,175
On basement one.

887
01:08:24,844 --> 01:08:26,554
Just kill me.

888
01:08:26,637 --> 01:08:28,305
I won't get out.

889
01:08:28,556 --> 01:08:30,266
I didn't know my bed felt this nice.

890
01:08:31,517 --> 01:08:34,520
Should we tell them
to let us sleep in our rooms from now on?

891
01:08:34,812 --> 01:08:36,856
That's just what you would say.

892
01:08:36,939 --> 01:08:38,274
You think we're camping?

893
01:08:38,357 --> 01:08:39,775
I was just joking, you wench.

894
01:08:39,859 --> 01:08:41,986
Yeong-ro, are you looking for something?

895
01:08:42,069 --> 01:08:44,905
Seol-hui, have you seen my electric watch?

896
01:08:45,531 --> 01:08:46,699
Your watch?

897
01:08:46,782 --> 01:08:48,409
Right! The bag.

898
01:08:48,492 --> 01:08:50,202
It must be in the red bag.

899
01:09:30,534 --> 01:09:31,785
Don't run!

900
01:09:31,869 --> 01:09:32,995
What?

901
01:09:33,078 --> 01:09:34,830
You can't stop me!

902
01:09:38,667 --> 01:09:39,668
Thank…

903
01:09:40,628 --> 01:09:43,547
Thank you for last time.

904
01:09:49,345 --> 01:09:53,057
No one's ever taken my side before.

905
01:09:56,185 --> 01:09:57,311
Thank you.

906
01:09:58,354 --> 01:09:59,855
I mean it.

907
01:10:07,238 --> 01:10:09,281
My room is over there.

908
01:10:12,326 --> 01:10:13,327
Go.

909
01:12:22,748 --> 01:12:24,541
My thigh's strong enough

910
01:12:25,125 --> 01:12:26,460
to stop bullets now.

911
01:12:29,588 --> 01:12:31,423
Ouch, that hurts.

912
01:12:33,342 --> 01:12:34,968
Go in! Now!

913
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:39,640
Eun Yeong-ro ran away.

914
01:12:42,351 --> 01:12:43,894
-What?
-Room 207.

915
01:12:45,396 --> 01:12:46,814
Have you seen Yeong-ro?

916
01:12:47,856 --> 01:12:50,442
She went to the washroom first.

917
01:12:50,526 --> 01:12:51,360
Follow me.

918
01:12:55,531 --> 01:12:58,033
-Where's she?
-What's going on?

919
01:12:58,117 --> 01:12:59,660
Quiet!

920
01:12:59,743 --> 01:13:01,787
Sit down!

921
01:13:01,870 --> 01:13:04,498
-If you move, I'll shoot you!
-Hey.

922
01:13:05,666 --> 01:13:06,792
You bastard!

923
01:13:09,253 --> 01:13:10,462
You bastard!

924
01:13:10,546 --> 01:13:12,297
You little…

925
01:13:16,885 --> 01:13:18,679
-Untie me!
-Okay.

926
01:13:25,602 --> 01:13:26,728
Ma'am.

927
01:13:27,521 --> 01:13:28,522
What's going on?

928
01:13:28,605 --> 01:13:30,691
Guys, come here. Now!

929
01:13:30,774 --> 01:13:32,025
Hurry!

930
01:13:32,109 --> 01:13:34,278
-Gather!
-Now!

931
01:13:34,361 --> 01:13:37,030
-Hurry!
-Tie him up!

932
01:13:37,614 --> 01:13:38,740
What?

933
01:13:39,575 --> 01:13:40,993
Eun Yeong-ro!

934
01:13:48,542 --> 01:13:49,793
Eun Yeong-ro!

935
01:13:53,046 --> 01:13:54,882
<i>We're going to escape from the dorm.</i>

936
01:13:54,965 --> 01:13:57,426
Listen carefully. In the prayer room,

937
01:13:57,509 --> 01:13:59,553
there's a secret passage
you don't know about.

938
01:13:59,636 --> 01:14:02,139
Through that passage,
go down to the basement one.

939
01:14:02,222 --> 01:14:05,184
And take the central staircase
and go out through the main door.

940
01:14:05,476 --> 01:14:07,102
This might be our last chance.

941
01:14:07,186 --> 01:14:10,564
Don't be scattered, and move as one.

942
01:14:10,647 --> 01:14:11,607
Quietly.

943
01:14:12,191 --> 01:14:14,109
Hurry up! Go!

944
01:14:14,902 --> 01:14:16,403
Hurry up! Go!

945
01:14:16,487 --> 01:14:17,696
Go!

946
01:14:21,325 --> 01:14:22,618
Go!

947
01:14:44,431 --> 01:14:45,641
RESTROOM

948
01:14:46,391 --> 01:14:47,226
What's going on?

949
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:50,145
Yeong-ro's in the room
on the fourth floor.

950
01:14:50,229 --> 01:14:53,857
The ANSP decided
to get you and her out of here first.

951
01:14:56,026 --> 01:14:57,653
I'll tell you more once we get there.

952
01:15:10,874 --> 01:15:12,042
Yeong-ro?

953
01:15:16,421 --> 01:15:17,589
Yeong-ro?

954
01:15:19,716 --> 01:15:20,884
RESTRICTED

955
01:15:55,419 --> 01:15:57,421
Go down the stairs.

956
01:15:57,504 --> 01:15:59,047
Watch your step.

957
01:15:59,131 --> 01:16:00,674
-Stairs?
-Follow her.

958
01:16:00,757 --> 01:16:03,385
-Watch your step.
-Okay.

959
01:16:03,468 --> 01:16:04,595
Be careful.

960
01:16:04,678 --> 01:16:06,638
-Be careful.
-Watch your step.

961
01:16:52,017 --> 01:16:54,811
Of course,
they wouldn't be hiding it there.

962
01:16:59,024 --> 01:17:01,735
Where would they have hidden
the money bag?

963
01:17:01,985 --> 01:17:04,780
I definitely smell money around here.

964
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:13,872
Go lock the door! Now!

965
01:17:19,294 --> 01:17:21,797
Hey, hurry up. Lock it!

966
01:17:22,506 --> 01:17:24,007
Hurry!

967
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:31,348
You bastards!

968
01:17:35,811 --> 01:17:37,813
RESTRICTED

969
01:17:50,826 --> 01:17:52,202
Eun Yeong-ro!

970
01:19:24,503 --> 01:19:25,337
Eun Yeong-ro.

971
01:19:37,891 --> 01:19:39,017
Answer me.

972
01:19:40,101 --> 01:19:41,311
You're in there, right?

973
01:19:48,902 --> 01:19:52,197
I must find you first to save you.

974
01:19:52,781 --> 01:19:54,074
Yeong-ro.

975
01:19:56,034 --> 01:19:57,786
Answer me. Please.

976
01:20:28,608 --> 01:20:31,611
We need to come up with a code.

977
01:20:33,697 --> 01:20:36,157
Knock, knock. Knock, knock, knock.

978
01:20:36,241 --> 01:20:39,786
If you hear two knocks and then three,
it's me, Yeong-ro.

979
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:42,998
And you need to open
the door right away. Agreed?

980
01:20:44,916 --> 01:20:46,042
Agreed.

981
01:21:00,724 --> 01:21:02,309
Answer me. Please.

982
01:22:10,043 --> 01:22:12,128
You little bastard.

983
01:22:33,817 --> 01:22:34,859
What?

984
01:22:56,297 --> 01:22:57,716
Where's the detonator?

985
01:22:59,134 --> 01:23:00,301
Where is it?

986
01:23:10,895 --> 01:23:12,731
Guys, let's clear the way.

987
01:23:13,398 --> 01:23:14,232
Take it.

988
01:23:20,822 --> 01:23:21,990
Wait!

989
01:23:28,163 --> 01:23:28,997
Everyone.

990
01:23:30,123 --> 01:23:32,333
The square thing attached to the door.

991
01:23:33,001 --> 01:23:34,335
It's connected to a thread.

992
01:23:35,086 --> 01:23:36,046
That's a bomb.

993
01:23:36,129 --> 01:23:38,089
-Oh, my God!
-Don't move!

994
01:23:38,798 --> 01:23:40,592
Be careful!

995
01:23:42,844 --> 01:23:44,304
Come on!

996
01:23:45,138 --> 01:23:46,723
Do something about it!

997
01:23:46,806 --> 01:23:48,183
-Come on!
-Hurry!

998
01:23:48,266 --> 01:23:50,602
-Come on!
-Do something!

999
01:23:50,977 --> 01:23:52,562
Is that really a bomb?

1000
01:23:52,645 --> 01:23:55,273
-You're a cadet. Do something!
-I don't know how.

1001
01:23:55,356 --> 01:23:57,233
-Come on! Hurry!
-But I…

1002
01:23:57,317 --> 01:23:59,652
-Please. Do something!
-How can I…

1003
01:23:59,944 --> 01:24:02,197
-Do something!
-There's a bomb!

1004
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:03,323
Cadet!

1005
01:24:03,406 --> 01:24:05,033
-Cadet!
-Yes?

1006
01:24:06,576 --> 01:24:08,244
What do we do?

1007
01:24:08,328 --> 01:24:09,662
Wait.

1008
01:24:21,007 --> 01:24:22,342
Come down here!

1009
01:24:36,231 --> 01:24:37,357
Don't move.

1010
01:24:41,611 --> 01:24:42,570
What?

1011
01:24:48,493 --> 01:24:49,577
Don't move.

1012
01:24:53,331 --> 01:24:54,624
I'll shoot you.

1013
01:24:54,707 --> 01:24:55,917
I'll really shoot you.

1014
01:25:00,588 --> 01:25:01,673
Hurry up.

1015
01:25:02,632 --> 01:25:06,094
-Hurry up. Please.
-Hey.

1016
01:25:07,512 --> 01:25:08,596
Don't move.

1017
01:25:14,644 --> 01:25:16,855
-It's open!
-Sir!

1018
01:25:16,938 --> 01:25:17,772
-Sir.
-Yes?

1019
01:25:17,856 --> 01:25:19,440
Lead the students and go out first.

1020
01:25:19,524 --> 01:25:20,692
Hurry!

1021
01:25:20,775 --> 01:25:22,777
-Let's go!
-Hurry!

1022
01:25:32,829 --> 01:25:34,706
Hurry! Go!

1023
01:25:35,498 --> 01:25:37,333
Everyone stop!

1024
01:25:47,093 --> 01:25:48,678
Everyone stop.

1025
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:51,347
Comrade Kang.

1026
01:25:59,230 --> 01:26:00,607
Don't move.

1027
01:26:02,108 --> 01:26:03,902
If anyone moves…

1028
01:26:11,701 --> 01:26:12,952
What is this?

1029
01:26:14,454 --> 01:26:16,581
You want us all to die together?

1030
01:26:22,587 --> 01:26:24,172
Damn it.

1031
01:26:24,255 --> 01:26:25,215
What the hell.

1032
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:36,351
What if the hostages all died?

1033
01:26:36,434 --> 01:26:38,978
Bombs exploded. I don't think

1034
01:26:39,145 --> 01:26:41,481
only 13 people died.

1035
01:26:41,564 --> 01:26:43,483
Only 13 must die.

1036
01:26:43,983 --> 01:26:45,109
Exactly 13.

1037
01:26:45,193 --> 01:26:46,861
<i>We hear more and more heartbreaking news</i>

1038
01:26:46,945 --> 01:26:50,031
<i>about those who still don't know
if their children are alive.</i>

1039
01:26:50,114 --> 01:26:51,574
You lunatic!

1040
01:26:51,658 --> 01:26:54,202
<i>You're lying
about my daughter's safety, aren't you?</i>

1041
01:26:54,285 --> 01:26:56,996
If you even lay a finger on my daughter…

1042
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:58,539
<i>Since when did we</i>

1043
01:26:58,873 --> 01:27:01,417
<i>only do as agreed with the South?</i>

1044
01:27:01,501 --> 01:27:04,087
Besides, the South's goal is

1045
01:27:04,170 --> 01:27:05,588
to win the election,

1046
01:27:05,672 --> 01:27:07,924
not to save the hostages' lives.

1047
01:27:09,092 --> 01:27:10,802
There's no way my father would…

1048
01:27:14,264 --> 01:27:15,765
<i>Dead or alive…</i>

1049
01:27:17,892 --> 01:27:19,477
<i>We're in the same boat now.</i>
