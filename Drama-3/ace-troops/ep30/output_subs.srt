00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,564
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,901
EPISODE 9

3
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,366
How did the ANSP team leader
escape through the prayer room?

4
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,328
There was a secret passage
to the exit on basement two.

5
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,498
A secret passage?

6
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,249
No wonder

7
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,503
the old man and hall director
exchanged looks suspiciously.

8
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,755
We should go.

9
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,215
Follow me.

10
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,009
If this button is pushed,

11
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,513
the dorm will explode.

12
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:20,890
Right?

13
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,814
You say you don't

14
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,235
want to hurt anyone when you have this?

15
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,532
I understand why you don't trust me.

16
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,912
But that's for defending ourselves,
not for killing you.

17
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:46,291
Hundreds of soldiers are
surrounding this place.

18
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,461
I needed to do something to protect
my team members as their leader.

19
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,801
Stay away!

20
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,514
-No!
-What if the soldiers break in?

21
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,145
Will you still not use it then
since it's not for killing?

22
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,813
I told you.

23
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,108
I don't want to hurt anyone in this dorm.

24
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,735
Do you expect me to believe that?

25
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,655
Yes.

26
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,534
After the cruel things I did to you,

27
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,413
why would I lie to you
about getting out in nine days?

28
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,500
Everything I've done to you,
that's already too hard for me to bear.

29
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,589
We're really going
to get out of here in nine days.

30
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,425
So please

31
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,595
-give that back to me.
-Don't come near.

32
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,305
Stay away.

33
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,228
Why? Why in nine days?

34
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,773
Why not get out right now?

35
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,025
Why wait until nine days later?

36
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,827
You're lying again, aren't you?

37
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,248
You're lying again.

38
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,127
Everything you've told me was a lie.

39
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,467
That's not true.

40
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,220
Give that to me. It's dangerous.

41
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,485
Don't--

42
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,790
Please.

43
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,334
Please believe me.

44
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,588
I don't want to make you suffer anymore.

45
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,069
There's nothing
I can do for you but watch.

46
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,991
And that's driving me crazy.

47
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,968
Comrade Kang Cheong-ya.

48
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,430
It's this way.

49
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,062
Hey, student.

50
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,610
Tell the hall director

51
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,612
to bring me some water.

52
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,656
Tell her.

53
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,533
Now.

54
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,494
Gosh.

55
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,038
I'm parched.

56
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,498
Give me some water.

57
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,668
Hey!

58
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,254
Hey.

59
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,047
Shut your trap, will you?

60
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,340
I'm thirsty.

61
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,883
I'm so thirsty.

62
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:06,801
Please.

63
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,887
I'm so thirsty. Come on.

64
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,431
Please.

65
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,225
Give me some water.

66
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,601
Hey.

67
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,271
Just a cup of water.

68
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,398
But you had some not long ago!

69
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,941
I didn't get any.

70
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,235
And I'm all tied up.

71
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,362
I feel so stifled.

72
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,781
Come on. Just give me some water.

73
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,200
Anyone wants to bring him water?

74
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,757
What did you want to tell me?

75
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:50,052
We have no time,
so I'll ask you straightforward.

76
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,681
Did you really not know
Lim Soo-ho was hiding in the dorm?

77
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,850
When you even bugged the dorm?

78
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,520
Did you help him hide

79
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,939
since you're on the same side?

80
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,114
On the same side?

81
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,160
Shut it before I rip you to shreds.

82
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,828
I'm sick and tired

83
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,414
of you people.

84
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,036
I warned you not to do anything stupid

85
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,206
and that I'd not let it slide again.

86
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,624
What did I do?

87
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,462
How else did Eun Yeong-ro
find out about the detonator I had?

88
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,009
I just tried to stop her
from trying to escape.

89
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:19,475
I told her about the detonator in your
pocket to stop her from acting rashly!

90
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,646
Shouldn't you ask me why
before hitting me?

91
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:31,988
Sit.

92
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:10,026
You say they'll kill everyone here
including you and me in nine days?

93
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,740
If you're trying to make me surrender,
you should stop here.

94
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:16,657
Surrender?

95
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,203
You think they'll accept your surrender?

96
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:26,250
They even play with the citizens' lives
to maintain their power.

97
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:30,379
I can't let those bastards have their way.
Is that so hard to understand?

98
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,722
The party considers the people
as its children.

99
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,224
They'd never abandon you?
You really think so?

100
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,936
A huge sum of money
must be at stake in this joint scheme.

101
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:50,608
You think your party will give up
the money to save three spies?

102
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,526
You really believe that?

103
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,746
You think you're safe since you haveâ€¦

104
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,666
the ANSP director's daughter?

105
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,250
Wake up.

106
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,921
I bet they'll try everything they can to
get her out of here before the election.

107
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,101
Bring me proof that what you say is true.

108
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,395
Proof?

109
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,689
Tied up like this?

110
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,108
Your subordinate will come back in later.

111
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,736
Tell her to bring me proof
that I can trust.

112
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,659
Hard evidence that
our countries are scheming to kill us all.

113
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,747
But if she brings it,

114
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,791
will you destroy that detonator

115
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,544
and work with me?

116
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,258
Are you willing to work with us
to get out of here alive?

117
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,600
How could you be so stupid
to hide a gun in Dr. Kang's bag?

118
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:10,521
They say those bastards won't
release her because of you!

119
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,897
Apologize. Now.

120
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,401
Don't do anything stupid again.

121
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,779
And just come out
as soon as you deliver the supplies. Okay?

122
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,365
Yes, sir.

123
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,659
By the way, sir,

124
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,245
seeing how he specifically asked for her,

125
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:29,498
he must like her very much.

126
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,751
-Is that so?
-Yes.

127
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,420
Are you serious right now?

128
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,632
I stabbed them in the back
to let the SWAT team break in

129
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,801
without knowing it was a lie.

130
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,846
He might be asking for me
in order to get back at me.

131
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:44,764
Hey, look.

132
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,016
You make it sound like we fooled you.

133
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,059
They're threatening to blow up the dorm!

134
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,145
How can we send the SWAT team in?

135
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,230
We must save the students!

136
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,447
Go

137
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:05,576
tell Dr. Kang
that we'll save her at all costs

138
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,330
and to have faith in me and hang in there.

139
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,249
Only Dr. Kang?

140
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:18,380
-God damn it. Seriouslyâ€¦
-You understood, Jang, right?

141
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,965
Get out. You don't have much time.

142
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,593
-Now.
-You get out too.

143
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:23,636
Wait for me.

144
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,348
God, my blood pressure again.

145
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,521
The ANSP has gotten
the food and medical supplies

146
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,982
the spies demanded
ready in front of their camp.

147
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,484
The supplies include

148
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,736
ten boxes of cup noodles,

149
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,281
drugs for diabetes and blood pressure,
and some men's clothes.

150
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,199
He's coming out!

151
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,451
Hey!

152
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,661
Gyeong-hui!

153
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,873
Can't you do your job right?

154
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,584
How could you let
a stray dog waltz in here?

155
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,502
I'm sorry, sir.

156
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,295
Are you mad at me?

157
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,923
Because a stray dog like me is so polite?

158
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,300
Come on, Gyeong-hui. Be understanding.

159
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,386
For old times' sake!

160
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,221
She's going in!

161
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,649
Are the hostages safe? Is anyone injured?

162
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,442
Who's in there other than the students?

163
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:25,197
In return for providing the food
and medical supplies the spies demanded,

164
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,366
we, the ANSP,

165
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,661
strongly urged them
to release the hostages safely.

166
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,289
Do you have any contingency plans?

167
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,333
<i>If the spies don't release
the hostages this time,</i>

168
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:40,462
<i>unfortunately, it might prolong
the hostage situation.</i>

169
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,549
<i>That's how we're looking at it. However--</i>

170
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,844
It might prolong it?

171
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,556
They've already started putting on an act.

172
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,532
You're watching the news, right?
Listen carefully.

173
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,118
In the people's eyes,

174
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,996
<i>it must look like
you're making this drag on</i>

175
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,791
<i>and we're trying to break in
to take you down at any chance we get.</i>

176
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,461
And it must look like we're not able to

177
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,880
because you might blow yourselves up!

178
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,340
Killing all the hostages!

179
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,301
<i>So,</i>

180
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:30,429
you can't release any of your hostages.

181
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,264
Okay?

182
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,350
Wait.

183
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,435
And don't touch Dr. Kang.

184
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:40,522
<i>Don't even step on her shadow. Okay?</i>

185
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,571
I should get back down.

186
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,074
Comrade Lim Soo-ho.

187
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,791
Hand the detonator over to me.

188
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:06,048
-Pardon?
-You let a girl take it away from you.

189
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,759
How can I trust you with it?

190
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,433
If you don't bring back
your revolutionary spirit now,

191
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,561
I will kill you myself.

192
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,376
Release the hostages.

193
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:47,798
He thinks our revolutionary warriors are
his minions. We should teach him a lesson.

194
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,800
Don't you agree?

195
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,986
You bestowed men's clothes on us.

196
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,529
I'm forever grateful.

197
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,032
I'm so excited.

198
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,618
Could I get changed right away?

199
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,497
I told you to check for explosives first.

200
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,584
I will, sir.

201
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,883
Gosh, it's heavy.

202
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,137
Damn it.

203
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,514
SWAT team, go in! Now!

204
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,767
SWAT team, go in!

205
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,737
Didn't I tell you it's most important

206
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,114
to maintain mutual trust?

207
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,119
I'mâ€¦ I'm sorry.

208
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,288
I had no other choice.

209
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,376
But the SWAT team
didn't break in after all, did they?

210
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,213
Leave this woman to me.

211
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,924
Go upstairs with the supplies.

212
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,009
Follow me with them.

213
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,177
Yes, sir.

214
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,513
All right.

215
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,556
Here we go.

216
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,268
Sir.

217
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,397
You should tell me
before you make a deal with them.

218
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,733
You're releasing 30 hostages, and what?

219
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,819
Just ten boxes of cup noodles?

220
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,404
-You're on the losing end.
-Gwang-tae.

221
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,617
Just lie low.

222
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,169
Follow me.

223
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:01,890
Mr. Lee.

224
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,685
Mr. Lee.

225
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,812
Are you all right?

226
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,314
Oh, no. What happened to your face?

227
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,776
We don't have much time.

228
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,570
I'm fine.

229
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,239
Don't worry, and just sit.

230
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,200
Now.

231
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,343
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

232
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,930
Sir, It's a scoop.

233
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,308
I smell something fishy.

234
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,810
That's not what I mean.

235
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,147
Something doesn't feel right here. Yes!

236
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,443
I got to go! I'll call you later!

237
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,861
PAY PHONE

238
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,030
Oh, my goodness!

239
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,451
Food delivery!

240
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,454
-Here!
-What took you so long?

241
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,497
-What's with you?
-I'm sorry.

242
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,374
Here's the <i>jjamppong.</i>

243
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,919
-Here are the <i>tangsuyuk</i> and <i>dumplings.</i>
-All right.

244
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,129
Don't be late next time!

245
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,174
-Where should I put them?
-There.

246
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,842
-Here.
-Thank you.

247
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,608
Mr. Nam. The food is here.

248
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:35,651
Okay.

249
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,528
<i>The doctor is being held at the momentâ€¦</i>

250
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,364
Damn it.

251
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,991
It's like I'm locked up in prison.

252
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,576
Hang in there, sir.

253
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,955
If the reporters see you,
they'll make a fuss about it.

254
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,415
"The administration's number two guy
is at the scene.

255
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,376
it must be some political scheme."

256
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,835
What?

257
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,879
I'm sorry.

258
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,550
Hey, wait!

259
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,095
<i>â€¦and in this crisis,
the ANSP's wise judgment</i>

260
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:06,682
<i>and action is needed
more than ever at the scene.</i>

261
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,436
Hey, where's the pickled radish?

262
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,314
I'm sorry, sir.

263
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,484
Look at this guy. Where's your head at?

264
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,987
Enjoy!

265
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,824
<i>This is a scheme.</i>

266
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,493
A joint scheme
for the presidential election.

267
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,996
What?

268
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,540
But still, how could they shoot at you?

269
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,834
Professor Han's case was also part of it.

270
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,336
That's why they got us away from him.

271
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,338
But he was killed,

272
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,341
so this hostage situation
became their plan B.

273
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,885
They're using thisâ€¦

274
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,931
for the election?

275
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:50,809
No way.

276
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:56,273
They're not planning
to kill the students, are they?

277
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,860
Will you just pray they won't?

278
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,660
What do I have to do then? Just tell me.

279
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,704
For them to win the election
by a landslide,

280
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:13,206
they'll try to kill everyone
including the hostages.

281
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,500
We need proof
that they're planning to do it.

282
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:19,338
As a matter of fact,
Gal and I agreed to dig into it together.

283
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,089
As soon as we get it, I'll have Gal--

284
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,466
If you act rashly,

285
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,303
both you and Gal will be killed.

286
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,889
Bring it to me once you get it.

287
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,393
What are you going to do in here?

288
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,156
I'll demand more supplies tomorrow.

289
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,533
I'll ask them to send you in again,

290
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,078
so find it by tomorrow morning.

291
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,038
But how can Iâ€¦

292
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:06,968
Wait.

293
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,554
Are you twoâ€¦

294
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:13,141
We're both rats in a trap.
If we fight each other, we'll all die.

295
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,602
We must get out alive.

296
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:19,398
Just a minute.

297
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,359
Give us privacy just for a minute.

298
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,612
If you're done talking, come out.
Both of you.

299
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,156
Comrade.

300
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,745
She's my fiancÃ©e.

301
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,873
Is a minute too much to ask?

302
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,216
Come out.

303
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:01,773
So tell me.

304
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:07,237
Exactly how many single women
are in the dorm at the moment?

305
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,991
Exactly 56 single women.

306
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,911
Dr. Kang's in there too, right?

307
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,831
Oh, right. Dr. Kang is

308
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:19,458
also

309
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,501
single.

310
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,170
Is it possible

311
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:26,923
that she's been married
and didn't tell us?

312
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,178
Come on. No way.

313
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:35,390
I once asked her why she was still single.

314
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,433
And?

315
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:44,107
One day in winter, while she was hiking
in some snowy mountains,

316
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,735
she slipped and hung
on the edge of a cliff.

317
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,071
<i>Just when she thought
she was going to die,</i>

318
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,908
<i>some guy saved her.</i>

319
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,785
<i>Without knowing his name or age,</i>

320
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:59,998
she spent the night with him
in some cave and parted ways.

321
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:03,001
Since then,
she's never been able to get over him.

322
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,213
She said she was

323
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,091
waiting to meet him like some destiny.

324
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,594
Oh, my goodness.

325
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,890
It sounds like something
from a romance novel.

326
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,644
Did anything happen in that cave?

327
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,270
Stop it.

328
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,233
I didn't peg her as naive.

329
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,777
That's what I thought too.

330
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:32,781
So if we include Dr. Kang,

331
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,574
it's 57, right?

332
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,787
But they say the hostages are
unlikely to be released,

333
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,581
so don't worry about it, ma'am.

334
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,208
Really?

335
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,253
The hostages won't be released?

336
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,714
But still,

337
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,299
you shouldn't be clapping.

338
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,180
From now on,
30 of you who are to be released

339
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,808
will get out of the dorm
with the ANSP agent.

340
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,730
Go out one by one in order.

341
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,114
Follow me in order. Be careful.

342
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,629
Keep your heads down.

343
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,775
I need to go to the restroom!

344
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,793
You have it easy, you bastard.

345
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:53,546
Cleaned up with new clothes.

346
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,091
Hey, you wear this.

347
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,884
-No, give that to me.
-No.

348
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,844
Hey!

349
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:20,782
Mr. Lee.

350
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,911
They say they'll leave here in nine days.

351
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:28,456
Is that true?

352
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,042
Soo-ho said that?

353
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,963
Did he tell you that?

354
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:37,298
Yes.

355
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,552
He said they'll leave quietly.

356
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,638
But why nine days later?

357
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,895
Don't tell anyone

358
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,857
what I'm about to tell you.

359
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,192
I told you!

360
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:01,030
Where's the money bag?

361
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,116
You think I'm crazy? Why would I tell you?

362
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,161
I'll take that money with me
no matter what

363
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,956
and give you your share. Just count on me.

364
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,960
Don't touch me.

365
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,378
What's your problem?

366
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,548
We both were born to wrong parents.

367
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:20,508
We should help each other!

368
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:23,553
Stop!

369
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,473
Damn it!

370
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,986
Yes, I'm uneducated and poor.

371
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,238
I received nothing from my parents,

372
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,616
except this body!

373
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,410
But do you know how hard

374
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,704
I'm trying to save my ill father?

375
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:54,292
You think I'm like you,
a leech living off his old father?

376
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,712
You b****.

377
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,048
What do you know about me?

378
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,843
Who are you to judge me?

379
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:08,306
Do you have any idea
what kind of man Kim Man-dong is?

380
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:19,359
You communist bastard!

381
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,449
You're dead meat.

382
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,375
Stop.

383
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,293
I yield!

384
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:40,129
Don't kill me. Please. I'm sorry.

385
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,090
Please.

386
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:56,437
I'll get back after washing up a little.

387
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,382
What?

388
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32,932
Darn it.

389
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,367
The ANSP agent, who went in with the food

390
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,370
-and medical suppliesâ€¦ is coming out!
-She's out!

391
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:55,747
-There she is!
-She's coming out!

392
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,789
The students are coming!

393
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,043
Hurry up!

394
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,045
Move faster!

395
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,339
<i>Unlike the ANSP's predictions,</i>

396
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:07,300
The Northern spies are
releasing some hostagesâ€¦

397
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:09,093
Those damn communists!

398
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,471
What do we do, sir? What if they say

399
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,514
there are only three spies in the dorm?

400
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,974
What do you think?

401
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,851
Take them to our interrogation room!

402
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,354
Stop the reporters
and get them into the car!

403
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,648
Hurry up! Hurry!

404
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,108
-You take care of the reporters.
-Don't worry, sir.

405
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,361
-Let's go, Seung-jun.
-Yes, sir.

406
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,414
-Get them in the car!
-Yes, sir!

407
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:47,757
Hurry!

408
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:19,706
Are the hostages safe? Is anyone injured?

409
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:24,293
Without giving in
to these evil communists,

410
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,754
we sent in a negotiation expert

411
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,090
and tenaciously convinced them.

412
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,383
As a result,

413
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:33,761
we accomplished
the release of tens of hostages today.

414
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:35,805
As we speak,

415
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:40,351
the released students are being taken
to the nearby hospital for check-ups.

416
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:44,605
We'll do our best
for them to go back to their families.

417
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:46,649
Thank you.

418
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,652
-Thanks.
-Thanks to you, I got a scoop.

419
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,740
What?

420
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:55,825
What's that?

421
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,121
Whatâ€¦ What's going on?

422
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,750
-Hey, just a while.
-What?

423
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,544
-I'm borrowing this for just a while.
-No, you can't!

424
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:09,172
I'll pay you double later!

425
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:12,133
-I'm sorry!
-Wait, sir!

426
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:13,676
Hey!

427
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,094
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

428
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,597
Didn't I make myself clear?

429
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,931
I told you not to do anything!

430
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,809
Didn't I tell you
not to do anything stupid?

431
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,772
All I did was go in and come out quietly.

432
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:32,320
But you came out with the hostages!
Not just one but a lot of them!

433
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,240
They told me to do it.
What, should I have said no?

434
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,117
Wait a minute.

435
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,496
As many as 30 hostages have been released.

436
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,165
Aren't you happy?

437
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:48,836
Of course I am!

438
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,046
I'm happy!

439
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,215
I am! That's why I'm like this! Damn it.

440
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,759
What are you looking at? Work!

441
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,513
Get back to work, you idiots!

442
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,809
You get out! Now!

443
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,353
I don't want to see you.
Get out of my sight.

444
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:08,481
Just go. Don't even say bye.
Just leave. Go!

445
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,776
<i>I, An Gyeong-hui, and the ANSP</i>

446
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,320
<i>will do our best.</i>

447
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,615
<i>I solemnly swear it to the citizens.</i>

448
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:19,909
When I was in elementary school, I drew

449
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:22,120
a devil-looking Northern spy
and won an award.

450
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:26,332
But I guess they're human after all,
seeing how they released 30 hostages.

451
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,845
What? The release of the hostages
was unlikely?

452
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,807
So how many are left?

453
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,017
How many? Tell me!

454
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:48,104
Ma'am, you can't sit down.

455
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,314
The pins will hurt you.

456
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,862
Ma'am, don't worry too much.

457
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:57,989
How can I not worry right now?

458
00:35:58,656 --> 00:35:59,740
What if

459
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,368
exactly 13 students are left?

460
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:03,452
Then what?

461
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,165
Ma'am.

462
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,421
This is really

463
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,632
confidential information.

464
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:24,015
According to my husband,
this hostage situation is

465
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,187
a scheme that the North and South
planned together.

466
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,064
My goodness.

467
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:35,318
The North and South?

468
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:38,404
For the election?

469
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,114
Yes.

470
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,452
So I doubt they're really going

471
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:47,455
to kill those college girls. Right?

472
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:49,999
You're right.

473
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,127
-They won't, right?
-No.

474
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,051
What about our Yeong-ro?

475
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,802
Was she released too?

476
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,513
Was Yeong-ro released too?

477
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,099
Well, I guess so.

478
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,518
Anything else that's unusual?

479
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,981
What? They shot at Gang-mu
to make him go back in?

480
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,608
When?

481
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,943
Okay, I'll be there.

482
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,278
I should go to the scene.

483
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,489
Why? What's going on?

484
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,708
Now that 30 of them have been released,

485
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,463
27 are left in there.

486
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,718
This is amazing.

487
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,721
It's getting closer to 13.

488
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:55,314
Lim Soo-ho isâ€¦ How should I put it?

489
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,444
I know this since I used to live with him.

490
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,948
I didn't get any killer or spy vibes
from him at all.

491
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,660
-Rather, he was quite sweet.
-Oh, God.

492
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,371
And he was quite thoughtful.

493
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,707
He released 30, and you're his fan now?

494
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,583
It's all your fault, Gwang-tae.

495
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,043
You suggested the blind date.

496
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,462
Come on, you can't blame him for that.

497
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:21,590
I mean, he didn't know Soo-ho was
a spy when he was setting us

498
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,801
-up on the blind date.
-Jeez.

499
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:26,387
Why are you taking his side?
Do you like him?

500
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:30,766
What?

501
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:38,441
Well, Iâ€¦ It's not that.

502
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,694
-I justâ€¦
-Hey. Yoon Seol-hui.

503
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,863
Don't tell meâ€¦

504
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:46,115
Yes, you're right, Hye-ryeong.

505
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:50,077
When I saw Seol-hui at the Open House,

506
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,413
she struck my heart

507
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,124
like it was destiny.

508
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,544
Struck your heart?
What is she, Cupid's Arrow?

509
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:01,589
What a sly bastard. That's not love.
You're just after her money.

510
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,799
How could you say that?

511
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:07,720
Seol-hui is my muse and sun.
You know nothing.

512
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:10,931
Seol-hui.

513
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,101
Will you marry me?

514
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,188
I'll protect you

515
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,940
for the rest of my life.

516
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,651
Hey!

517
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:25,571
Having fun?

518
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:34,205
Look at her. She's actually happy.

519
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,540
So why did you two-time him

520
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,667
when you weren't even interested in him?

521
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,464
What's a proposal without a ring?

522
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,633
You're right. What a shame.

523
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,551
It happens only once in your life!

524
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,804
By the way, have you even kissed?

525
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,180
-Stop that!
-Keep it down.

526
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:56,394
<i>Are you saying</i>

527
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,771
the presidential election is in nine days,

528
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,940
and for my dad to win the election,

529
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:04,151
we might all be killed?

530
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,240
I can't say for sure,
but we can't rule out that possibility.

531
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,254
Sir.

532
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,590
How about you use me?

533
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,343
Use you?

534
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,101
Then before that,

535
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,603
there's something you need to know.

536
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,275
I know it's hard to believe,

537
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,778
but the doctor is also a Northern spy.

538
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,615
The doctor?

539
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,369
-Dr. Kang is?
-Doctor.

540
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,872
-She's in pain.
-Let me see.

541
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,375
Where does it hurt?

542
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,779
Yes, sir. It's me.

543
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,408
I hope you and I will watch

544
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:39,872
the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games
next year side by side.

545
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,877
Why were the hostages already released?

546
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:46,545
Sir.

547
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:50,341
I swear those 30 hostages
were released under my orders.

548
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,760
I'm keeping them under control.

549
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,261
So don't worry, sir.

550
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:57,389
I swear on my life I will get my job done
so that I'll be able

551
00:41:57,473 --> 00:42:00,267
to watch the opening ceremony
with you next year, sir.

552
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:35,427
<i>You bastard!
I told you not to release the hostages!</i>

553
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,929
<i>And you released 30 of them?</i>

554
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:39,390
I never said I'd follow your orders.

555
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:43,811
You ignorant, fearless fool.

556
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,771
Do you know who I am?

557
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,233
I don't care, but what's your plan?

558
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,070
You guaranteed
our safe return to the North.

559
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:57,074
Tell me how you will do that in detail.

560
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,368
When I, Nam Tae-il, say

561
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:02,538
I'll send you back,
I'll make it happen no matter what!

562
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,290
I don't believe you

563
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,585
and what you said
about sending us back to the North.

564
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,921
Look. The day before the election,

565
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,881
after we rescue all the hostages,

566
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:16,468
we'll announce that we've killed
all of you. That's the plan!

567
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:17,636
Kill all of us?

568
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,055
You're going to kill us?

569
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,434
No, we'll fake it.

570
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:24,935
<i>You agreed to it.</i>

571
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:26,937
We're just three,

572
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,440
but you'll announce you killed seven?

573
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:30,983
We'll bring some bodies,

574
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:33,402
display them with your clothes,

575
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:36,739
<i>and hide you guys away. No one will know.</i>

576
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,117
<i>If you want to go back alive,</i>

577
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,660
just do as I say.

578
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:44,747
<i>If you don't,
you can just forget about negotiation.</i>

579
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:50,210
We have an astronomical amount
of money in our hands.

580
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:55,424
<i>So much money that the North won't
complain even if we end up killing you!</i>

581
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:23,369
Your lives are nothing
in front of that money.

582
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,079
Maybe I'll just go in and kill you.

583
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,623
Mr. Eun. Why are you backâ€¦

584
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,459
Did you have them shoot at Gang-mu?

585
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:34,171
How will you explain
once the situation is over?

586
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:38,926
Explain?

587
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:41,470
Do I have to?

588
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,766
Don't you know what he's like?

589
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,685
You know he won't just let it go.

590
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,603
His colleagues shot at him, so I'm sure

591
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,814
he found out it's a scheme
for the election.

592
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:54,775
You think he'll sit back
and do nothing in there?

593
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:57,444
Mr. Eun's right. He will never let it go.

594
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,239
We'll make him do nothing.

595
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,743
We can just make him stay there forever.

596
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:07,246
Stay there forever?

597
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,833
Are you saying you'll kill him?

598
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:14,336
Of course.

599
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:18,173
He's a troublemaker.
We'll be better off with him dead.

600
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,591
<i>If we say he died</i>

601
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:20,968
trying to save the students,

602
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:23,053
it'll improve our agency's image too.

603
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,221
What the hell?

604
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:25,681
<i>Be honest with me.</i>

605
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,267
Are you willing to kill the students too?

606
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:33,939
We need to make our boss
win the election for him to attend

607
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:37,359
the opening ceremony
of the Olympic Games as he wishes.

608
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,194
We're at such a crucial crossroads.

609
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:41,113
The girls' lives are not important.

610
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:44,074
If there comes a situation
where we have to kill them,

611
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,868
we'll just rescue your daughter--

612
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:50,080
Rescuing only my daughter
while all of the press is here?

613
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,417
Letting all the people watch it?

614
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,586
Did you forget about the agreement?

615
00:45:56,170 --> 00:46:00,090
<i>We agreed to killing all the spies</i>

616
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,885
and saving the hostages. Right?

617
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,220
What I'm saying is,
depending on the situation--

618
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:06,972
Even still!

619
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:10,559
We must save all of the students.

620
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,145
Including my daughter.

621
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:23,697
Take care, sir.

622
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,703
That hypocritical bastard.

623
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,413
Isn't he?

624
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,082
He even sent his son to the front lines

625
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,752
to remain in his position as director.

626
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:40,631
If you think about it,
it's his fault his son died!

627
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,174
Hey.

628
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:45,010
If the election goes wrong,

629
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:48,388
he'll bitterly regret
not having killed the students!

630
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:51,975
Then,

631
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:53,769
depending on the situation,

632
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,897
might we end up killing the students?

633
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,820
You are right, sir.

634
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,324
"You are right, sir"?

635
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,869
These goddamn bastards.

636
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:29,012
Hurry up!

637
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,357
Hey, take them inside.

638
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,235
Keep in line.

639
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,279
<i>Just like those released earlier,</i>

640
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,614
have all of them sign the NDA
saying they'll stay quiet.

641
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,159
Scare them a little bit

642
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,911
and send them to our hospital.

643
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:57,374
And make sure
no reporters are on your tail.

644
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:02,296
They arrived with no problem.

645
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:03,714
So don't worry, sir.

646
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:06,091
-A cigarette.
-Pardon?

647
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,175
Yes, sir.

648
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,306
Why are you carrying a bug detector?

649
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,683
What? What's going on?

650
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:28,196
Me?

651
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:36,955
Mr. Nam. A bug!

652
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:41,460
Who the hell planted this?

653
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,007
I'm sorry.

654
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:48,717
The delivery guy.

655
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,887
Why can't we go in there?

656
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:53,847
-We can't!
-My kid's in there!

657
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:56,642
-We need to go in!
-What's going on?

658
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,393
-What's this?
-What's going on?

659
00:48:58,477 --> 00:48:59,937
-What's this?
-Coming through.

660
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,772
Make way, please.

661
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,732
What? What's going on?

662
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:06,234
I came to pick up the bowls.

663
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:08,612
-Let him pass.
-Let him pass!

664
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:11,156
<i>What, are you going to kill him?</i>

665
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:13,325
<i>Of course.</i>

666
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:15,410
<i>Are you willing to kill the students too?</i>

667
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:16,995
<i>The girls' lives are not important.</i>

668
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,748
<i>If the election goes wrong,</i>

669
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,918
<i>he'll bitterly regret
not having killed the students!</i>

670
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,963
We need to send this into the dorm.

671
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:27,714
And if it's revealed--

672
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,425
Wait. You'll give it to the spies?

673
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,272
What's the emergency frequency
you and your fiancÃ©e use?

674
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:30,152
What's the rush?
You gave her until tomorrow morning.

675
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:31,445
We're running out of time.

676
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:35,115
I need to see
if it's possible to get the proof.

677
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:37,826
What's the frequency?

678
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,043
It's 44.

679
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,182
Han-na.

680
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:02,184
<i>Han-na, do you hear me?</i>

681
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:07,397
Mr. Lee? What's going on?

682
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:08,940
Did you get the proof?

683
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:10,776
Yes, I got it.

684
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:16,114
We found the delivery bike.

685
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,576
Damn it.

686
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:26,374
Damn it.

687
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:35,425
I filmed Tae-il
and the released hostages being taken.

688
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:38,053
-Give me a gun.
-Here, sir.

689
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:53,985
You son of a b****.

690
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,656
<i>I went easy on you for old times' sake,</i>

691
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:59,449
and you betrayed me?

692
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,996
Come on. What's wrong, sir?

693
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,581
What's this about?

694
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,583
Why are you with this bastard?

695
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:10,335
<i>Are you working with him?</i>

696
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:12,546
<i>-What are you talking about?
-Hey!</i>

697
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,841
<i>-Take her too.
-Yes, sir.</i>

698
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,635
What are you doing? Let go of me!

699
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:21,012
We found a bug in the camp.

700
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:24,015
-Let go!
-What are you waiting for? Get out.

701
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,183
Stay still.

702
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:27,686
<i>-Get out!
-If you take me,</i>

703
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:32,190
<i>my company won't just sit still.
This is suppressing free speech!</i>

704
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:36,027
Han-na must've been caught.

705
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:39,739
She's in danger because of you!

706
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:42,701
Sit.

707
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:45,912
Proof? What's the use of goddamn proof?

708
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:49,082
You know that they'll kill us all
nine days later.

709
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,500
You know they will.

710
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:56,214
Shut up.

711
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:59,718
The party guaranteed the safe return
to the North of all three of us.

712
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:03,555
Do you still not get it?

713
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,141
Are you that stupid?

714
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,978
Right. I heard
you told Yeong-ro you'll leave

715
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,605
nine days later.

716
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,566
She asked why nine days later,

717
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:17,694
so I told her all this is
a scheme for the election.

718
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:21,198
That her dad might kill all the hostages.

719
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:23,491
-You told her?
-What?

720
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:25,327
You feel bad for her?

721
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,454
On top of her brother's death,

722
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:31,875
she found out that her dad might kill
all her friends. She must be going crazy.

723
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:35,420
She was already blaming herself for this.

724
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:37,672
She must just want to die.

725
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:39,966
You bastard.

726
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:46,973
It's hard, isn't it?

727
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,143
I'm sure it's hard for you too.

728
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,647
Because you love Yeong-ro.

729
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:00,946
Shut up.

730
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,697
You think I'm a turncoat?

731
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,658
Does loving the girl who saved you
make you a turncoat?

732
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:09,454
Your party traded
their loyal agents for money.

733
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:12,791
What about them?

734
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,605
You're the ANSP team leader.

735
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:45,282
The ANSP frames and kills those who
fight against the tyranny of the regime.

736
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:50,954
You're the regime's hounds

737
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:54,499
that trample on innocent people's lives
to make the security state.

738
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,044
That's what the ANSP is.

739
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:02,132
And you're their agent.
You have no right to blame me.

740
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,975
In the end, they're all the same.

741
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:14,477
On the pretext of repatriation,

742
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:17,063
the North deceived
countless Korean-Japanese

743
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,316
and trampled on their lives.

744
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:23,653
The South made the security state.

745
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:37,751
Lim Soo-ho.

746
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:44,007
You must wake up now.

747
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,469
Lives of mere pawns like usâ€¦

748
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:49,220
-We must--
-No.

749
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:52,682
"We"?

750
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,354
You and I are enemies.

751
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,751
Would you like some?

752
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,836
I'm not hungry.

753
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:26,174
Didn't you say you'll rip me to shreds?

754
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:33,306
I said some harsh wordsâ€¦ I admit it.

755
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:37,811
How did you find out?

756
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:40,438
The room inside your office.

757
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,568
It's quite impressive.

758
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,325
Please keep it

759
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:54,536
from the students.

760
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,121
Of course.

761
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:59,541
You work for my agency after all.

762
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:03,628
How could a mere agent like me

763
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:05,588
blow your cover?

764
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,675
We're on the same side.

765
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:12,345
Mr. Lee.

766
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:15,140
Since both of our lives
are in their hands,

767
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:16,724
let me tell you something.

768
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:20,603
Though I yielded to their power
since I'm weak,

769
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:24,983
I still think they're evil people who
frame the innocent to climb the ladder.

770
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:26,693
I've neverâ€¦

771
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,363
sold my students out to them.

772
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,661
Then,

773
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:39,789
Let's save the studentsâ€¦

774
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:42,834
together.

775
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:52,343
Save?

776
00:57:58,516 --> 00:57:59,350
Hey.

777
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:01,352
Go back to where you were.

778
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,453
<i>I didn't plant the bug!</i>

779
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:21,706
So how can I have any tape to give you?

780
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:24,000
When you

781
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:26,211
disguised yourself as a delivery guy

782
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:30,423
and came in to film Mr. Nam with this,

783
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:33,426
you planted the bug, you bastard!

784
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:38,056
Damn.

785
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:43,520
If I'd known this would happen,
I would've just planted my bug.

786
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:45,480
COSMOS TOYS

787
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:47,440
Let's get to work.

788
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:54,155
Dong-jae. Oh Dong-jae!

789
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,699
Open this! Come on!

790
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,493
Open up!

791
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:01,704
Open it!

792
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:14,045
Comrade Joo. It's time to patrol.

793
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:17,006
<i>It was "Bimok,"
so beautiful that it makes you sad.</i>

794
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:20,259
<i>On a sunny and weedy corner
of a mountain foot,</i>

795
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:23,805
<i>there was a wooden cross
on a nameless soldier's grave.</i>

796
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,765
<i>And the song was inspired--</i>

797
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:32,855
Polka Dot.

798
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:40,571
You're quite a good singer. Sing it again.

799
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:43,157
Look.

800
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,827
My name is Ko Hye-ryeong, not Polka Dot.

801
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:49,205
Besides, I don't sing
without any accompaniment.

802
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:51,916
-I'm Hosu's Maria Callas.
-Maria Callas!

803
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:54,460
Is anyone willing

804
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,587
to play piano for Hye-ryeong?

805
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,716
You're good at it.

806
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:02,176
I'll play it for you.

807
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:14,856
<i>The cannon and gun smoke
swept the deep vale</i>

808
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:18,109
<i>At the sunny placeâ€¦</i>

809
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:20,069
I don't think it'll work.

810
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:24,323
But that's the safest place to hide.

811
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:28,286
I doubt Yeong-ro will tell them easily.

812
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:31,247
She's even hiding that
she's the ANSP director's daughter.

813
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:35,126
This is a scheme for the election!

814
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:38,129
How long will you dance
to the ANSP's tune?

815
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:46,846
How on earth will you lose Kang Cheong-ya?

816
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:55,772
<i>-There has been
-There has been</i>

817
01:02:55,855 --> 01:03:00,651
<i>-Moss at every joint and frown
-Moss at every joint and frown</i>

818
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:06,240
Quiet!

819
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:16,501
Well, what about the second verse?

820
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:45,780
STUDENT HEAD OF DORM

821
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:53,412
Excuse me. I'm sorry,

822
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:55,373
but can I go to the restroom?

823
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:57,041
I can't hold it.

824
01:03:57,124 --> 01:03:58,459
Lie down.

825
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:13,641
I need to go to the restroom.

826
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:23,734
Those who need to go, come all at once.

827
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:25,528
This is the last time.

828
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,403
Hey, cadet.

829
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:12,909
We'll escape tomorrow.

830
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:15,119
The hall director knows it.

831
01:05:15,202 --> 01:05:18,706
Joo, the one who took them
to the restroom. You take care of him.

832
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:20,666
Us?

833
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:21,626
Got it?

834
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:24,253
Go.

835
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:49,862
8 DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION

836
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:26,440
What are you doing?

837
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:29,694
For them to keep fit,

838
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:31,904
they should do this at least.

839
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:33,572
Everyone sit.

840
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:35,241
We're not livestock!

841
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:37,743
You keep us here
without letting us wash up.

842
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,286
This is a human rights abuse!

843
01:06:40,287 --> 01:06:41,414
For days,

844
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:43,666
we haven't even brushed our teeth.

845
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:47,128
It's hard to sleep here,

846
01:06:47,211 --> 01:06:48,963
but what's worse is the smell.

847
01:06:49,922 --> 01:06:50,965
Can we wash up?

848
01:06:51,924 --> 01:06:54,510
I've never spent four days
without brushing my teeth.

849
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:56,971
-Please.
-Seriously.

850
01:06:57,054 --> 01:06:58,931
-Just this once.
-Please.

851
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,267
-I feel so itchy.
-I can't take it anymore.

852
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:03,269
-Please.
-I'll be obedient.

853
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:05,604
-Please.
-Let us wash up.

854
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:07,648
-I feel so itchy.
-Please.

855
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:10,317
We'll feel better
if you let us wash our faces.

856
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:13,404
You can let us do that much, right?

857
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:15,156
Are you out of your mind, you brats?

858
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:22,955
Fine.

859
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,458
Ten people at a time.

860
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:28,419
Do anything funny,
and the rest will get hurt.

861
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:30,755
Our basins are in our rooms.

862
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:32,757
Can we stop by our rooms?

863
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:35,009
But don't go above the second floor.

864
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:37,636
First group of ten.

865
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,138
-Me!
-Me!

866
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:40,723
-Me first!
-Me first!

867
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:42,183
-Me first!
-Me first!

868
01:07:42,266 --> 01:07:44,310
-Me!
-Me!

869
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:46,520
-Me first!
-Me first!

870
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:47,855
Stand in a line in front of me.

871
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:51,734
-Move.
-Number!

872
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:54,487
Call out numbers!

873
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:56,030
One.

874
01:07:56,697 --> 01:07:58,074
-Two.
-Three.

875
01:07:58,491 --> 01:07:59,909
-Four.
-Five.

876
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:07,583
-Why are we running?
-Ko Hye-ryeong!

877
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:11,212
-Let's go to our room on the 3rd floor.
-What? Butâ€¦

878
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:12,963
I forgot where I put my toothbrush.

879
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:16,258
It's okay. I have a new one,
so don't worry. Let's go.

880
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:31,107
Well,

881
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:35,820
my room's next to the washing room.
Can I stop by for a second?

882
01:08:36,987 --> 01:08:38,864
You must stay on the second floor.

883
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:45,246
I'm not a student here,

884
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:48,290
so I have no one to borrow anything from.

885
01:08:53,754 --> 01:08:54,964
Where's your room?

886
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,175
On basement one.

887
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:01,554
Just kill me.

888
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:03,305
I won't get out.

889
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:05,266
I didn't know my bed felt this nice.

890
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:09,520
Should we tell them
to let us sleep in our rooms from now on?

891
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:11,856
That's just what you would say.

892
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:13,274
You think we're camping?

893
01:09:13,357 --> 01:09:14,775
I was just joking, you wench.

894
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:16,986
Yeong-ro, are you looking for something?

895
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:19,905
Seol-hui, have you seen my electric watch?

896
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:21,699
Your watch?

897
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:23,409
Right! The bag.

898
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:25,202
It must be in the red bag.

899
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:06,785
Don't run!

900
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:07,995
What?

901
01:10:08,078 --> 01:10:09,830
You can't stop me!

902
01:10:13,667 --> 01:10:14,668
Thankâ€¦

903
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:18,547
Thank you for last time.

904
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:28,057
No one's ever taken my side before.

905
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:32,311
Thank you.

906
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:34,855
I mean it.

907
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:44,281
My room is over there.

908
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:48,327
Go.

909
01:12:57,748 --> 01:12:59,541
My thigh's strong enough

910
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:01,460
to stop bullets now.

911
01:13:04,588 --> 01:13:06,423
Ouch, that hurts.

912
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:09,968
Go in! Now!

913
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:14,640
Eun Yeong-ro ran away.

914
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:18,894
-What?
-Room 207.

915
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:21,814
Have you seen Yeong-ro?

916
01:13:22,856 --> 01:13:25,442
She went to the washroom first.

917
01:13:25,526 --> 01:13:26,360
Follow me.

918
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:33,033
-Where's she?
-What's going on?

919
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:34,660
Quiet!

920
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:36,787
Sit down!

921
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:39,498
-If you move, I'll shoot you!
-Hey.

922
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:41,792
You bastard!

923
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:45,462
You bastard!

924
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:47,297
You littleâ€¦

925
01:13:51,885 --> 01:13:53,679
-Untie me!
-Okay.

926
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:01,728
Ma'am.

927
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:03,522
What's going on?

928
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:05,691
Guys, come here. Now!

929
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:07,025
Hurry!

930
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:09,278
-Gather!
-Now!

931
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:12,030
-Hurry!
-Tie him up!

932
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:13,740
What?

933
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:15,993
Eun Yeong-ro!

934
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:24,793
Eun Yeong-ro!

935
01:14:28,046 --> 01:14:29,882
<i>We're going to escape from the dorm.</i>

936
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:32,426
Listen carefully. In the prayer room,

937
01:14:32,509 --> 01:14:34,553
there's a secret passage
you don't know about.

938
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:37,139
Through that passage,
go down to the basement one.

939
01:14:37,222 --> 01:14:40,184
And take the central staircase
and go out through the main door.

940
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:42,102
This might be our last chance.

941
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:45,564
Don't be scattered, and move as one.

942
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:46,607
Quietly.

943
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:49,109
Hurry up! Go!

944
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:51,403
Hurry up! Go!

945
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:52,696
Go!

946
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:57,618
Go!

947
01:15:19,431 --> 01:15:20,641
RESTROOM

948
01:15:21,391 --> 01:15:22,226
What's going on?

949
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:25,145
Yeong-ro's in the room
on the fourth floor.

950
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:28,857
The ANSP decided
to get you and her out of here first.

951
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:32,653
I'll tell you more once we get there.

952
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:47,042
Yeong-ro?

953
01:15:51,421 --> 01:15:52,589
Yeong-ro?

954
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:55,884
RESTRICTED

955
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:32,421
Go down the stairs.

956
01:16:32,504 --> 01:16:34,047
Watch your step.

957
01:16:34,131 --> 01:16:35,674
-Stairs?
-Follow her.

958
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:38,385
-Watch your step.
-Okay.

959
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:39,595
Be careful.

960
01:16:39,678 --> 01:16:41,638
-Be careful.
-Watch your step.

961
01:17:27,017 --> 01:17:29,811
Of course,
they wouldn't be hiding it there.

962
01:17:34,024 --> 01:17:36,735
Where would they have hidden
the money bag?

963
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:39,780
I definitely smell money around here.

964
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:48,872
Go lock the door! Now!

965
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:56,797
Hey, hurry up. Lock it!

966
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:59,007
Hurry!

967
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:06,348
You bastards!

968
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:12,813
RESTRICTED

969
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:27,202
Eun Yeong-ro!

970
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:00,337
Eun Yeong-ro.

971
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:14,017
Answer me.

972
01:20:15,101 --> 01:20:16,311
You're in there, right?

973
01:20:23,902 --> 01:20:27,197
I must find you first to save you.

974
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:29,074
Yeong-ro.

975
01:20:31,034 --> 01:20:32,786
Answer me. Please.

976
01:21:03,608 --> 01:21:06,611
We need to come up with a code.

977
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:11,157
Knock, knock. Knock, knock, knock.

978
01:21:11,241 --> 01:21:14,786
If you hear two knocks and then three,
it's me, Yeong-ro.

979
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:17,998
And you need to open
the door right away. Agreed?

980
01:21:19,916 --> 01:21:21,042
Agreed.

981
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:37,309
Answer me. Please.

982
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:47,128
You little bastard.

983
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:09,859
What?

984
01:23:31,297 --> 01:23:32,716
Where's the detonator?

985
01:23:34,134 --> 01:23:35,301
Where is it?

986
01:23:45,895 --> 01:23:47,731
Guys, let's clear the way.

987
01:23:48,398 --> 01:23:49,232
Take it.

988
01:23:55,822 --> 01:23:56,990
Wait!

989
01:24:03,163 --> 01:24:03,997
Everyone.

990
01:24:05,123 --> 01:24:07,333
The square thing attached to the door.

991
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:09,335
It's connected to a thread.

992
01:24:10,086 --> 01:24:11,046
That's a bomb.

993
01:24:11,129 --> 01:24:13,089
-Oh, my God!
-Don't move!

994
01:24:13,798 --> 01:24:15,592
Be careful!

995
01:24:17,844 --> 01:24:19,304
Come on!

996
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:21,723
Do something about it!

997
01:24:21,806 --> 01:24:23,183
-Come on!
-Hurry!

998
01:24:23,266 --> 01:24:25,602
-Come on!
-Do something!

999
01:24:25,977 --> 01:24:27,562
Is that really a bomb?

1000
01:24:27,645 --> 01:24:30,273
-You're a cadet. Do something!
-I don't know how.

1001
01:24:30,356 --> 01:24:32,233
-Come on! Hurry!
-But Iâ€¦

1002
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:34,652
-Please. Do something!
-How can Iâ€¦

1003
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:37,197
-Do something!
-There's a bomb!

1004
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:38,323
Cadet!

1005
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:40,033
-Cadet!
-Yes?

1006
01:24:41,576 --> 01:24:43,244
What do we do?

1007
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:44,662
Wait.

1008
01:24:56,007 --> 01:24:57,342
Come down here!

1009
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:12,357
Don't move.

1010
01:25:16,611 --> 01:25:17,570
What?

1011
01:25:23,493 --> 01:25:24,577
Don't move.

1012
01:25:28,331 --> 01:25:29,624
I'll shoot you.

1013
01:25:29,707 --> 01:25:30,917
I'll really shoot you.

1014
01:25:35,588 --> 01:25:36,673
Hurry up.

1015
01:25:37,632 --> 01:25:41,094
-Hurry up. Please.
-Hey.

1016
01:25:42,512 --> 01:25:43,596
Don't move.

1017
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:51,855
-It's open!
-Sir!

1018
01:25:51,938 --> 01:25:52,772
-Sir.
-Yes?

1019
01:25:52,856 --> 01:25:54,440
Lead the students and go out first.

1020
01:25:54,524 --> 01:25:55,692
Hurry!

1021
01:25:55,775 --> 01:25:57,777
-Let's go!
-Hurry!

1022
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:09,706
Hurry! Go!

1023
01:26:10,498 --> 01:26:12,333
Everyone stop!

1024
01:26:22,093 --> 01:26:23,678
Everyone stop.

1025
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:26,347
Comrade Kang.

1026
01:26:34,230 --> 01:26:35,607
Don't move.

1027
01:26:37,108 --> 01:26:38,902
If anyone movesâ€¦

1028
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:47,952
What is this?

1029
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:51,581
You want us all to die together?

1030
01:26:57,587 --> 01:26:59,172
Damn it.

1031
01:26:59,255 --> 01:27:00,215
What the hell.

1032
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:11,351
What if the hostages all died?

1033
01:27:11,434 --> 01:27:13,978
Bombs exploded. I don't think

1034
01:27:14,145 --> 01:27:16,481
only 13 people died.

1035
01:27:16,564 --> 01:27:18,483
Only 13 must die.

1036
01:27:18,983 --> 01:27:20,109
Exactly 13.

1037
01:27:20,193 --> 01:27:21,861
<i>We hear more and more heartbreaking news</i>

1038
01:27:21,945 --> 01:27:25,031
<i>about those who still don't know
if their children are alive.</i>

1039
01:27:25,114 --> 01:27:26,574
You lunatic!

1040
01:27:26,658 --> 01:27:29,202
<i>You're lying
about my daughter's safety, aren't you?</i>

1041
01:27:29,285 --> 01:27:31,996
If you even lay a finger on my daughterâ€¦

1042
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,539
<i>Since when did we</i>

1043
01:27:33,873 --> 01:27:36,417
<i>only do as agreed with the South?</i>

1044
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:39,087
Besides, the South's goal is

1045
01:27:39,170 --> 01:27:40,588
to win the election,

1046
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:42,924
not to save the hostages' lives.

1047
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:45,802
There's no way my father wouldâ€¦

1048
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:50,765
<i>Dead or aliveâ€¦</i>

1049
01:27:52,892 --> 01:27:54,477
<i>We're in the same boat now.</i>
