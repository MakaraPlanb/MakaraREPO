00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,979
[Episode 30]

4
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,520
I've finished. Goodbye.

5
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:37,960
Wait.

6
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,120
My shoulders.

7
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,240
Whenever I have a mood swing,

8
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,400
I can't feel them

9
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,520
and sometimes I even can't move them.

10
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,120
When I returned from the battlefield,

11
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,560
I tried

12
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,640
pouring boiled water on them.

13
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,760
I still couldn't feel them.

14
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,480
I told

15
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,560
no one about this.

16
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,760
I saw the doctor and

17
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,030
was told there was no way to treat them.

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,030
It's not a big deal

19
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,920
but we still can't ignore it.

20
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,560
Until one day,

21
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,560
Xiu discovered it.

22
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,200
At first,

23
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,680
she saw many doctors look for prescriptions.

24
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,640
But all to no avail in the end.

25
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,720
Then

26
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,920
whenever I got sick due to my shoulders.

27
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,760
Xiu hugged me with tears.

28
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,480
I tried to comfort her.

29
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,040
I called Xiu's name.

30
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,440
I said it's alright

31
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,079
and I would be okay.

32
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,800
Xiu stopped crying

33
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,000
but she still hugged me.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,440
Hugged you? Then what happened?

35
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,240
Could her hug heal you?

36
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,160
How did you know that?

37
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,600
Her hug healed you?

38
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,920
What's the problem with you?

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,600
Xiu hugged me

40
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,520
and I just felt reassured.

41
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:02,760
At that time,

42
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,240
I calmed down.

43
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,280
I could feel her breath,

44
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,400
her inclusiveness,

45
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,400
and her love.

46
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,320
I, Gu Yiye,

47
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,240
believe firmly in logic,

48
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,560
science,

49
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,800
and theories.

50
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,840
But in this case,

51
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,480
I believe in a person.

52
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,960
I believe in a relationship.

53
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:30,920
Gu,

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,880
you know what?

55
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,040
Xiu

56
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,440
gives you a thing

57
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,640
that nobody else can give.

58
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,440
It's love.

59
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,360
It's the love between you two.

60
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,480
Keep trying,

61
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,160
Battalion Commander Gu.

62
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,880
Goodbye.

63
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,080
Girl,

64
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,160
you know that

65
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,560
you're almost 30

66
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,760
after finishing your graduate study.

67
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,760
It's time to get married.

68
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:33,960
Don't you agree?

69
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,960
Dad,

70
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,480
that's just what I'm going to talk about.

71
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,040
Let me finish my words first.

72
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,240
Your mother called me the other day

73
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,159
and said she would like to see you.

74
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,880
I think

75
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,760
she would like to see me by the way

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,480
and meet her would-be son-in-law.

77
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,280
She just didn't put it straight.

78
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,640
Really?

79
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,920
Did she really mean it?

80
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,520
She didn't hate you anymore?

81
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,360
I know that

82
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,360
you put in many good words for me

83
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,040
in front of your mother

84
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,280
and tried quite hard.

85
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,160
Your mom now doesn't resent me

86
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,360
as much as before

87
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,160
and she can

88
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,240
forgive me.

89
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,760
It's a matter that gnawed at my mind

90
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,680
and you solved it.

91
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,280
To thank you for it,

92
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,040
enjoy the meal.

93
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,680
Here, dad.

94
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,280
Have some more.

95
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:30,720
Thank you.

96
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:34,960
Xiu,

97
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,960
I'll go now.

98
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,360
Wait.

99
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,000
What's the matter?

100
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,320
Are you gonna see Nanzheng in this shirt?

101
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:45,840
Yes.

102
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,400
What's wrong?

103
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,880
You don't look good in it.

104
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,080
I think it's good.

105
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,400
Is the restaurant expensive?

106
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,240
Yes.

107
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,120
That's good.

108
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,960
Nanzheng deserves it.

109
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,200
Xiu,

110
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,560
don't get it wrong.

111
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,480
I didn't.

112
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,640
Nanzheng is beautiful and has a decent family.

113
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,960
It's a pity for her

114
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,640
to spend all the time in the army

115
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,760
with uncouth fellows like you.

116
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,240
Since you have the chance to eat with her,

117
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,600
you should invite her to a good place.

118
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
You took me to

119
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,800
good restaurants many times.

120
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,480
I know they are expensive

121
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,200
even though you never told me.

122
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,720
I...

123
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,240
am not used to such things.

124
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,680
I tried to

125
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,440
forget about money

126
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,960
and enjoy the time with you.

127
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,320
But

128
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,840
I just felt

129
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,880
not used to it.

130
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,360
Xiu,

131
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,240
don't push yourself.

132
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,480
We still have a long life

133
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,360
to live with each other.

134
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,800
Yiye,

135
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
you don't need to waste your time on me.

136
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,760
Do you understand?

137
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,800
I don't want you to change yourself

138
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,520
just to make me happy.

139
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,680
That's not the man I love.

140
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,600
It smells good.

141
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,240
You're stewing a chicken?

142
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,400
You know I can't have it today

143
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,480
and you want me to yearn for the taste.

144
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,920
You can't eat your fill with western food.

145
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,560
I know you like chicken.

146
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,560
I will leave some for you in the pot.

147
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,720
Xiaofei also likes it.

148
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,720
Did he come back from school?

149
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,840
Generally speaking,

150
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,520
he should have come back at this time.

151
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,080
But I don't know where he goes today.

152
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,160
Xiu, tell you what.

153
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,720
If Xiaofei

154
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,480
dares to

155
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,600
tear down the company's water pipe again,

156
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,640
I will give him a bitter lesson.

157
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:14,840
You don't really

158
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,720
mean it.

159
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,800
You can't make up your mind to beat him.

160
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,600
Xiaofei is naughty

161
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,960
but he is smart.

162
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,120
He is better at solving

163
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,520
Mathematical Olympiad problems than I am.

164
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,640
You can't win him in the land battle chess game either.

165
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,880
However smart he is,

166
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,280
he is sure to serve in the army.

167
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:35,480
Well,

168
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:36,280
it's too early

169
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:36,960
to make a decision.

170
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,120
Okay.

171
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:49,940
♫ Leave a place for you in my palm. ♫

172
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,440
Goodbye.

173
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:57,810
♫ The south wind blows gently. ♫

174
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,070
♫ It blows away the smog. ♫

175
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:08,540
♫ It brings me to you. ♫

176
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,800
Here are all the dishes you order. Please enjoy the meal.

177
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,800
Thank you.

178
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,360
Enjoy it.

179
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,160
Go ahead.

180
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,760
What is the thing that you can't say on the phone

181
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,600
and require meeting here?

182
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,760
I just want to meet you and have a chat.

183
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,880
Are Xiu and you

184
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,320
having problems?

185
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,200
Yes.

186
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,120
She insisted that

187
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,680
I dressed up like this

188
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,920
to see you.

189
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,760
She misses you.

190
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,200
I come to see you

191
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,240
for Gao Liang.

192
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,400
If he gets sick,

193
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,000
you're most likely the reason

194
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,920
for his sickness.

195
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,480
You know what.

196
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,760
I'm getting to the root of his sickness.

197
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,520
I don't think you make a good analogy.

198
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,480
What happened to Gao Liang?

199
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,240
He

200
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,480
fell from a great

201
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,280
Special Forces captain

202
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,280
to an officer that

203
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,160
can be replaced at any time.

204
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,960
It's terrifying.

205
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,480
Given that

206
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,880
he is so unlucky,

207
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,360
just spare him.

208
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,480
And, to tell the truth,

209
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,640
a man of his age

210
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,160
is occupied with all kinds of things.

211
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,080
Even an iron man can't bear his burden.

212
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,880
The most important thing is

213
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,680
you

214
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,400
are his greatest support.

215
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,280
So don't waver.

216
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,320
If you have any hesitation,

217
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,680
his life

218
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,600
will be turned

219
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,920
upside down.

220
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,560
I often have the wrong impression

221
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,640
that it's you two who're in a relationship.

222
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,920
He needs you to pass these words.

223
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,760
Why doesn't he talk to me in person?

224
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,760
I'm also a man.

225
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,040
I know how he feels.

226
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,240
He is

227
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,800
pondering about his mistakes.

228
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,680
He doesn't want to see anybody,

229
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,760
not to mention you.

230
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,560
As far as I'm concerned,

231
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,680
Gao Liang is very lucky.

232
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,000
Why?

233
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,040
Look at you.

234
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,680
Beautiful and talented.

235
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,360
You're also the first one in Army A

236
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,640
to have a master's degree in information engineering.

237
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,280
Except sometimes

238
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,280
a bit ill-tempered,

239
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,080
you are perfect.

240
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,440
You're outstanding

241
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,680
and you can't air your grievances

242
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,840
because you care about him.

243
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,000
And you don't want to put it straight.

244
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,520
Nowhere can Gao Liang

245
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,760
find

246
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,400
another good girl like you.

247
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,960
Look at me.

248
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,480
How proud I am.

249
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,600
But now I sit here,

250
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,880
leaving my family behind

251
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,960
and making every effort,

252
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,480
to ask you to forgive him.

253
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,360
I have no idea

254
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,800
why he is so lucky.

255
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,560
I think

256
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,400
begging for forgiveness is boring

257
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,520
but you do a great job.

258
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,520
I feel touched.

259
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,960
By the way,

260
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,640
do you receive the wedding invitation?

261
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,000
You mean Chunyu's wedding?

262
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,400
Yes.

263
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,360
Time is flying.

264
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,120
They're getting married.

265
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,080
That's it.

266
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,600
Chunyu

267
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,960
is going to be a bride.

268
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,320
I don't know whether Gao Liang will come.

269
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,480
♫ My beloved motherland. ♫

270
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:54,060
[LOVE]

271
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,680
♫ You're a sea that never dries up. ♫

272
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,120
♫ Always let me see blue waves and clear water. ♫

273
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,440
♫ The song in my heart. ♫

274
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,120
Xiaofei.

275
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,320
I'm coming.

276
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,960
Put it on. Don't get a cold.

277
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,120
Take care.

278
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,120
Don't make it dirty again.

279
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,200
Xiu goes to night school?

280
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,920
She planned to take a leave.

281
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,560
But she couldn't make up her mind.

282
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,840
And she can't drink.

283
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,720
She thinks she can save the time

284
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,480
to steam some date cakes

285
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,600
and give them to Chunyu and Xia Lin tomorrow.

286
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,720
Take a few more bites.

287
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,280
Among our family members,

288
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,560
Xiu is the first to go to night school, isn't she?

289
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,000
Your suggestion?

290
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,240
At first,

291
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,240
she was reluctant.

292
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,560
I accompanied her for two lectures.

293
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,040
Then she began to love the school.

294
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,440
And

295
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,800
after drinking this,

296
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,080
I'll leave first.

297
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,360
I'll go to pick up Xiu.

298
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,160
I won't join activities at night.

299
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,200
Cheers.

300
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,000
It's rare of you.

301
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,320
Mr. Gu knows to take care of his wife.

302
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,640
Stop it.

303
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,360
Don't mock me.

304
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,240
It's Gao Liang

305
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,240
who gave me the suggestion.

306
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,360
All the more reason to do so.

307
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,600
Here.

308
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,880
Xia Lin, Chunyu,

309
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,080
you two finally join forces with each other.

310
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,920
I won't ramble on.

311
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,640
Just one remark.

312
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,520
Keep winning in the war of marriage.

313
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,280
Thank you, Yiye.

314
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:29,680
Cheers.

315
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,440
Thank you.

316
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:31,680
Xiaofei.

317
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,200
Cheers.

318
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:32,960
Xiaofei.

319
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,640
Cheers.

320
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,180
[Bride]

321
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,000
Nanzheng.

322
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,160
Xiaofei.

323
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,560
Let's go.

324
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,080
I'll go now.

325
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,520
Goodbye.

326
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,080
Enjoy your meal.

327
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,510
Bye.

328
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,840
- Hooray.
- Cheers.

329
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,960
Congratulations.

330
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,240
Please help yourselves and enjoy yourselves.

331
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,440
Thank you for attending

332
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,320
our wedding today.

333
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,640
Chunyu.

334
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,120
Don't mind me. Go with your toasts.

335
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,680
Gao, why do you come so late?

336
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,840
You're late.

337
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,600
Why do you drink so much?

338
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,790
Chunyu is so beautiful today.

339
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,860
Enjoy yourselves.

340
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,120
I do envy her.

341
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,760
Congratulations.

342
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,400
Happy marriage.

343
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,480
- Thank you all.
- Thank you.

344
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,080
Gao Liang,

345
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,080
when can you make Nanzheng

346
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,240
put on the wedding dress?

347
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,920
We can't wait any longer.

348
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,720
Well, Tong Bing,

349
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,760
here is a box of tea for you.

350
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
Here you are. Take it.

351
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,320
What happened? Why are you so generous?

352
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,880
Okay. You drank too much.

353
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,280
Tong Bing,

354
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,080
cheers.

355
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,760
Chunyu.

356
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,000
Bridegroom.

357
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,820
[Bridegroom]

358
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,360
Let me drink with Gao Liang.

359
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,360
Cheers. Cheers.

360
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:39,880
Come here. Sit down.

361
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,120
Gao Liang,

362
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,600
I feel so happy to see people come today.

363
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,040
That you can come

364
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,600
makes me happier.

365
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,760
To tell the truth,

366
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,880
Sergeant Han

367
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,400
is like my own sister.

368
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,880
She is like my closest family member.

369
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,920
I feel delighted that you two can get married.

370
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,120
But one thing I have to remind you.

371
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,520
If I hear for once that

372
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,600
you bully Sergeant Han,

373
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:05,069
I will break your legs.

374
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,520
I promise.

375
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,520
Rest reassured.

376
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,640
Mom. Mom.

377
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,310
Look.

378
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,760
How do you like the picture?

379
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,589
Jingjing,

380
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:20,829
who're you drawing?

381
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,000
It's uncle Gao Liang.

382
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,640
It's how he looked like when he saved me.

383
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:28,960
Jingjing,

384
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,400
let's call it a day.

385
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,640
It's time for bed.

386
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,480
Take it slow.

387
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:41,460
[LOVE]

388
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,040
Mind your step.

389
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:41,960
Go to bed.

390
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,240
Take off your shoes.

391
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,960
Good night.

392
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,700
[LOVE]

393
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,280
Go on.

394
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
Got it. I got it.

395
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:41,800
Hold it.

396
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,840
Captain.

397
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,640
I'm Niu Mancang from Special Operation Battalion 2.

398
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,400
I'm...

399
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,240
You're catching a bird

400
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:53,640
and asking me,

401
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,320
the new captain for instructions.

402
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,760
Am I right?

403
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,280
Then how should I write the report?

404
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,120
Award Soldier with Second-class Merit to

405
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,200
Special Operation Battalion 2's

406
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,360
Niu Mancang

407
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,320
who with another soldier

408
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,800
caught a bird.

409
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,000
Report to captain.

410
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,920
Special Operation Battalion 2's soldiers will be transferred to other places soon.

411
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,400
No one knows what we will do next.

412
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,920
May be transferred to Sapper Battalion to build roads.

413
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,200
Maybe to the farms to raise pigs.

414
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,000
Nobody knows for sure.

415
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,160
The morale is gone.

416
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,680
The instructor is also going to be transferred to an office.

417
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,760
I don't know

418
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,400
what to do now.

419
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,120
All I can do now is wait for the disarmament order

420
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,320
to transfer me to civilian work

421
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,400
and go back to my family.

422
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,520
Well.

423
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,760
A very detailed conception.

424
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,400
You're still wearing the uniforms.

425
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,560
Look what a mess you are!

426
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,160
If I were you,

427
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,000
I would find a corner

428
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,280
to kill myself by bumping my head on it.

429
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,840
An army unable to survive failures

430
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,360
will never win in the end.

431
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,240
The same goes for life.

432
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,240
Pull yourselves together.

433
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,400
Set it up.

434
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,640
I'll catch birds with you.

435
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,080
You can't even catch birds,

436
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,360
let alone get back the unit designation.

437
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:29,920
Set it up.

438
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,480
Within 30 seconds,

439
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,760
all of you

440
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,080
got out and in formation here with proper uniforms.

441
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,320
This speed

442
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,320
is not slow.

443
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,480
Our Special Operation Battalion 2

444
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,920
came a cropper.

445
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,480
The future is unknown.

446
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,040
Everyone is anxious.

447
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:51,060
[Special forces with great spirit. Special forces with great people.]

448
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,160
But

449
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,880
you still recognize the whistling.

450
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,960
You still know that

451
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,160
the whistling is the order.

452
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,840
Good.

453
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,160
Special Operation Battalion 2

454
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,960
did lose.

455
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,360
A miserable failure.

456
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,480
A total failure.

457
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,080
Enemies

458
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,680
put us to rout.

459
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,720
And we're

460
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,000
going to be disbanded.

461
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,480
Now,

462
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,800
we only have two choices.

463
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,200
Give in

464
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,120
or

465
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,560
hold on to the last.

466
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:25,060
[Special forces with great spirit. Special forces with great people.]

467
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,800

party branch decided after contemplation

469
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,360
to join the contest of the army group

470
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,280
and work hard to win back

471
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,320
our unit designation.

472
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,680
Even we may die,

473
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,480
we'll die standing.

474
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,160
We shall live up to the special force spirit.

475
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,200
Are you resolute?

476
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,960
Yes.

477
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,720
Today,

478
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,720
I swear here that

479
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,800
I, Gao Liang,

480
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,680
will work with you

481
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,520
and return all the disgraces

482
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,720
to our opponents like what they did to us.

483
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,000
If I fail,

484
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,160
I will take off the military uniform

485
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,080
and apologize for my inability in front of our flag.

486
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,640
Now,

487
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,480
let me see

488
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,280
and let me hear

[Ask for Instructions about Selecting People to Form the Special Operation Battalion 2]

498
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:28,960
What is it?

499
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,800
The first to join the contest

500
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,880
for the unit designation of Special Operation Battalion 2

501
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,960
is Gu Yiye from the First Red Battalion of Regiment 700.

502
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,440
One can't avoid his nemesis.

503
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,800
He and Gao Liang

504
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,200
often compete with each other on the training ground.

505
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,760
Who else signed up for the contest?

506
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,560
The second is

507
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,200
Special Operation Battalion 2 itself.

508
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,400
Gao Liang?

509
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,200
Yes.

510
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,720
Why did he do so?

511
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,560
Because you said that

512
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,800
every infantry battalion

513
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,880
can compete for the unit designation of Special Operation Battalion 2.

514
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,120
Gao Liang's Special Operation Battalion 2

515
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,080
is also an infantry battalion that implements

516
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,640
special operations.

517
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,640
Good boy.

518
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,600
He has a point.

519
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,320
We have no reason to reject him.

520
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,440
As far as I know,

521
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,040
he doesn't have his hands free.

522
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,760
He makes use of the time

523
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,920
to prepare for another battle.

524
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,800
Good boy.

525
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,640
He is resilient. Gao Liang can't be defeated.

526
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,280
Who else?

527
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,520
To tell the truth,

528
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,040
everyone wants to be an ace troop.

529
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,440
I've investigated.

530
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,840
There are at least four

531
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,280
well-trained infantry battalion camps

532
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,920
that wanted a try in the contest for the unit designation

533
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,160
of Special Operation Battalion 2.

534
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,040
But once Gao Liang and Gu Yiye signed up,

535
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,720
they all withdrew.

536
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,880
Why? They fear Gu Yiye?

537
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:33,720
No.

538
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,760
They fear Gao Liang.

539
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,040
In recent years,

540
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,880
they have all competed with Gao Liang.

541
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,360
And no one

542
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,440
gained an upper hand over him.

543
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,880
Gao Liang joins the contest.

544
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,360
Who else dares to join?

545
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,400
Interesting.

546
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,440
One of them is victorious.

547
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,880
And the other strikes fear into the heart of his rivals.

548
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,200
Which is better?

549
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,460
[Approved. Troops concerned shall carry out the task and report to the political commissar. Zheng Yuan.]

550
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,880

551
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:10,640
Dad.

552
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,800
Zheng.

553
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,680
Why do you come back today? It's not a weekend.

554
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,080
I come back to get some stuff.

555
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,040
I will go to Shenzhen the day after tomorrow

556
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,200
to support the advance team of the Hong Kong Garrison for one month.

557
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,680
We also received the urgent notification that

558
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,240
on April 21,

559
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,560
the first advance team of the Hong Kong Garrison will reach Hong Kong.

560
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,960
The presence in Hong Kong

561
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,800
may not require

562
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,520
our military personnel

563
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,160
to sacrifice.

564
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,040
But it requires

565
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,360
our wisdom,

566
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,120
willpower and passion.

567
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,840
Time is ticking.

568
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,480
You've got a heavy task in communications.

569
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,600
The military district urgently deploys

570
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,760
five experts from our office

571
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,800
to support the advance team.

572
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,000
I'm one of them.

573
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,080
"One Country, Two Systems"

574
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,080
is a new thing

575
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,960
for the whole world.

576
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,440
We are lucky

577
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,400
to implement it.

578
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,920
Each step

579
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,760
will be a new page on history.

580
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,040
As a soldier,

581
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,760
it's a great honor

582
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,160
to join the task.

583
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,560
I am so proud of my daughter.

584
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,960
I'll cherish the chance.

585
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,120
Dad, I bought you a piece of clothes.

586
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,120
Try it on.

587
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,400
Here it is.

588
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,200
Okay.

589
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,080
Good.

590
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,760
Nanzheng,

591
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,400
what's going on with you and Gao Liang?

592
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,800
Dad, don't worry about us.

593
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,000
We'll handle it well.

594
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,960
Does the size suit you?

595
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,440
It's good.

596
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,560
Nanzheng,

597
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,200
Gao Liang is reliable

598
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,920
and values relationships.

599
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,560
He can't be a bad man.

600
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,920
He is under great pressure now.

601
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,520
Be more considerate.

602
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,840
Dad, we have a generation gap on this topic.

603
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,960
A generation gap?

604
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,320
You must have some underlying meanings.

605
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,680
You indicate that I failed to

606
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,800
manage the relationship with your mother

607
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,160
and is not in a good position to instruct you?

608
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,520
Dad, do you know it?

609
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,640
Each time you criticize yourself,

610
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,640
you look lovely.

611
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,160
What a lovely old man.

612
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,040
What do you call me?

613
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,480
An old man?

614
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,040
Don't call me that,

615
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,400
especially when other people are around.

616
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,080
Nanzheng, I've thought about it.

617
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,880
I still want to talk with you.

618
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,720
Dad, I come back to get clothes.

619
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,080
I don't have the time to talk.

620
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,040
Just a few words.

621
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,880
Sometimes,

622
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,360
I feel guilty.

623
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,560
Do you know how I felt

624
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,720
to meet your mother

625
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,040
when we were in a bad relationship?

626
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,720
Anxious?

627
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,000
Awkward?

628
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,040
Terrified.

629
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,920
Don't be kidding.

630
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,640
You survived the real war.

631
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,520
How could you be terrified by my mother?

632
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,560
If she was a shrewish middle-aged woman,

633
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,280
then that might make sense.

634
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,720
But my mother is so gentle that she doesn't talk loudly.

635
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,560
Why do you fear her?

636
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,920
That's why I fear.

637
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,320
I was afraid that I did a poor job.

638
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,280
In fact, I didn't do well.

639
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,440
But I can't change it.

640
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,400
Each second I spent with her,

641
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,000
I felt sorry.

642
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,840
It's torture.

643
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,440
I felt like

644
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,240
taking the wrong way on the battlefield.

645
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,760
You knew it's a trap.

646
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,080
And you still led people around you

647
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,760
to move forward.

648
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,160
You just couldn't stop.

649
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,280
Nanzheng,

650
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,000
I heard from He that

651
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,320
leaders and soldiers in combat battalions

652
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,520
are all fearful of Gao Liang.

653
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,400
But I think

654
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,320
Gao Liang is fearful of you.

655
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:10,000
♫ Happy birthday to you. ♫

656
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,440
Blow out the candles.

657
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,680
Happy birthday.

658
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,760
What's wrong with you?

659
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,960
Don't smear the cake on me. On the birthday person.

660
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,680
Who is it?

661
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,840
Vice-captain Gao.

662
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,920
The corridor is a mess.

663
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,720
Unpleasant.

664
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,960
It's not messy.

665
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:42,960
What beautiful flowers.

666
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,440
Beautiful?

667
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,760
Did you buy them?

668
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,760
Yes.

669
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,120
Nanzheng likes flowers.

670
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,840
This is my seat.

671
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,160
Put the hat away.

672
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,000
A humiliation over a century

673
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,560
will be expunged now.

674
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,600
It's a pride

675
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,320
to be able to dedicate

676
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,720
to the return of Hong Kong.

677
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,200
Here you are.

678
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,760
Here.

679
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,560
Drink to your journey.

680
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,280
Here.

681
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:41,960
Cheers.

682
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:49,680
Ms. Jiang,

683
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,120
The Special Operation Battalion 2

684
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,640
wants to invite you

685
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,680
to give us an lecture.

686
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,240
The time is 9 to 11 tomorrow morning.

687
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,280
It won't delay your schedule with the advance team.

688
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,240
What do you think?

689
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,080
A lecture?

690
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,040
Yes.

691
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,480
We got new equipment.

692
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,080
We're all trying the system.

693
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,560
But there are often problems

694
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,320
with communication blocks.

695
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,760
It has a serious impact on the training.

696
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,000
Many soldiers lost sleep over it.

697
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,480
Maybe there is a mismatch

698
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,680
of port connections?

699
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,360
No.

700
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,400
We've checked this problem.

701
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,720
That's why we need an expert like you

702
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,480
to check on site.

703
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,160
Well,

704
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,320
it's to solve the real problems for community-level forces.

705
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,720
Sure.

706
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,400
Hou Jian,

707
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,040
let's go tomorrow

708
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,800
and bring the R-2 transmission device.

709
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,880
Okay. No problem.

710
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:45,220
[Answer the call at once. Ready to fight. Sure to win.]

711
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,520
Your name is Hou Jian?

712
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,080
You're really an eye sore here.

713
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,880
Let's go.

714
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,400
Don't look back. It's none of your business. Let's go.

715
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,960
What do you mean? Where are we going?

716
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,920
Ms Jiang,

717
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,840
welcome to the Special Operation Battalion.

718
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,280
Start now.

719
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,400
Welcome. Warmly welcome.

720
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,840
Welcome. Warmly welcome.

721
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,920
Thanks. Thank you.

722
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,240
You're welcome. These are all wildflowers.

723
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,360
For free

724
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,400
but definitely 100% natural.

725
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,720
Zong Hui.

726
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,520
Yes, captain.

727
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,840
Let me introduce.

728
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,680
This is Zong Hui, our best soldier at parachuting.

729
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,560
This is Ms. Jiang.

730
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,080
- Hail, Ms. Jiang!
- Hail.

731
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,640
Delta wing.

732
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,520
You invited me to see this?

733
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,680
The first experimenting aircraft in the whole army.

734
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,080
The headquarter assign it to us and

735
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,800
asked us to test-fly for a year

736
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,240
and report the parameters to the headquarter.

737
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,040
The headquarter will

738
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,760
modify the aircraft according to the parameters

739
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,200
and then equip the whole army with it.

740
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,920
- Zong Hui.
- Yes.

741
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,560
Report your test-flight records.

742
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,320
Yes.

743
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,800
187 take-off and landing

744
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,560
with three

745
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,840
in-flight shutdowns

746
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,840
and twice left wing falling.

747
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,720
The accident rate is 0.027%.

748
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,040
In other words,

749
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,640
it is compliant with the flight standard.

750
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,560
Yes.

751
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,040
Good. Your Special Operation Battalion is outstanding.

752
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,880
Full of state-of-the-art equipment.

753
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,960
Of course. We're the Special Operation Battalion.

754
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,640
Zong Hui.

755
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,160
Yes.

756
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,320
This is the 188th test flight.

757
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,800
Are you ready?

758
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,400
Yes, captain. Ready.

759
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,920
Record the test flight.

760
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,000
Attention.

761
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,760
This time is a two-people test flight.

762
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,160
Yes.

763
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,840
Ms. Jiang. This way, please.

764
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,320
Nanzheng,

765
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,920
the data of this flight is very important.

766
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,120
We shall not only ensure safety

767
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,400
but also find the best performance data of the aircraft.

768
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,520
As an information technology expert in the military district,

769
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,640
I hope you can offer a technological guarantee

770
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,800
for its test-flight data.

771
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,240
Rest reassured.

772
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,600
Look it there.

773
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,640
Nanzheng,

774
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,080
look it there.

775
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,360
There is my battalion on the ground.

776
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,080
I see it.

777
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,160
The green patch

778
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,920
is where we practice parachuting.

779
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,480
We're flying so high.

780
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,160
Look at the cloud over there.

781
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,200
We can fly there.

782
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,520
Hold on tight.

783
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,840
It's strange. Why is the aircraft descending?

784
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,150
Something goes wrong, Nanzheng.

785
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,520
We're running out of time.

786
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,360
Tell me anything you want to say now.

787
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,800
I... I...

788
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,320
I love you.

789
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,360
Gao Liang, I love you.

790
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,230
What did you say just now? I didn't hear you.

791
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:39,630
You…

792
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:48,090
♫ Yearning for you, watching over you. ♫

793
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,480
You're making fun of me.

794
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,630
How dare you make fun of me?

795
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,080
Nanzheng,

796
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,280
happy birthday.

797
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:54,540
♫ Yearning turns into winds, read my mind, read your mind. ♫

798
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,520
I love you.

799
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:55,670
You're annoying but I love you too.

800
00:34:54,540 --> 00:35:01,110
♫ Yearning for me, looking at me. ♫

801
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,760
I love you more.

802
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,360
I love you the most. You're my favorite.

803
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:09,760
♫ Time turns into flowers, like you, like me. ♫

804
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,280
Captain.

805
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,680
I'll hand in my self-criticism this afternoon.

806
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:19,960
Gao Liang.

807
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,280
You seem to have fun with your work.

808
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,760
When will you get married?

809
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,080
Get married?

810
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,640
If you're married now,

811
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,800
you won't do any crazy things.

812
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,360
Since you're waiting for the re-organization of the force,

813
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,240
take the time to get married.

814
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,120
Nanzheng joined the advance team of the Hong Kong Garrison.

815
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,880
I can't get married until Hong Kong returns.

816
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,640
And I have joined the contest.

817
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,040
You think

818
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,280
the Special Operation Battalion

819
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,240
can't work without you?

820
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,640
I have to lead my brothers

821
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,080
and win back the unit designation of Special Operation Battalion.

822
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,960
Wipe away the humiliation.

823
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:53,840
I've sworn.

824
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,760
Why are you so stubborn?

825
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,360
The problem is Gu Yiye, right?

826
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,920
Do you want me to persuade him

827
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,560
to do you a favor?

828
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,120
What do you mean?

829
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,520
You think I can't defeat him?

830
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,550
I'm going to crush him.

831
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,280
If you do so,

832
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,320
you will ruin my reputation

833
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,840
and the Special Operation Battalion's.

834
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,880
You've already ruined it.

835
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,640
Why do you care now?

836
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,880
Then I can start over again..

837
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,080
Anyway,

838
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,760
I'll win back

839
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,920
the honor and the reputation.

840
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,280
Listen,

841
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,680
the result of this contest

842
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,600
determines how the Special Operation Battalion

843
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,000
will be re-organized.

844
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,960
If you're determined to stay,

845
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,120
then be prepared to

846
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,560
endure another failure.

847
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,280
You don't have much time.

848
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,720
Yes.

849
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,560
Your Battalion 2 will be deployed to field training.

850
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,040
Field training?

851
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,500
Hello.

852
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,240
Sergeant Han.

853
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,520
It's me. Gao Liang.

854
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,360
Captain Gao.

855
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:02,840
You were late

856
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,600
for my wedding.

857
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,680
And you didn't say a word.

858
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,440
At key moments like that, we see who a true friend is.

859
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,160
I call to apologize today.

860
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,640
I'll apologize to you in person.

861
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,000
I don't buy it.

862
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,000
Come on. Just get to the point.

863
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,320
The contest is set to begin.

864
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,680
I want to consult you

865
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,440
about communication security

866
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,560
to check if we miss anything.

867
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,680
A bad timing.

868
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,200
I'll go to Mt. Guier tomorrow.

869
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,520
Mt. Guier?

870
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,840
Isn't it a minefield?

871
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,320
Yes.

872
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,440
But the military district's team has cleared it.

873
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,680
It's safe now.

874
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,600
You've got a task?

875
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,400
No. 5 Defense Communication Line

876
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,520
has interruptions continuously

877
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,560
in the area.

878
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,200
So the military district's communication department

879
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,240
sends us to inspect the communication line.

880
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,440
What a coincidence.

881
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,960
I'm at the Lubing Slope for field training.

882
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,040
Since where you go is Mt. Guier,

883
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,920
do pay attention to your safety.

884
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,560
It's still dangerous there.

885
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,040
Okay. Don't worry.

886
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,520
I'll be back in a week or so.

887
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,400
When I'm back,

888
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,400
I'll fulfill the task you assign me.

889
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,600
Okay.

890
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,600
What are you doing here?

891
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,120
Ms. Han Chunyu.

892
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,040
Vice-captain Gao Liang from the Special Operation Battalion 2

893
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,800
of the army group

894
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,440
is here to welcome the most beautiful soldier bride.

895
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,400
On your way to Mt. Guier,

896
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,920
I've been standing at attention

897
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,680
and waiting for 58 minutes and 36 seconds.

898
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,760
I don't know whether this way

899
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,080
will make up being late for your wedding.

900
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,760
In addition,

901
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,200
I brought with me

902
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,320
your

903
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,680
most favorite food,

904
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,600
Shandong pancake.

905
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,680
Please accept it.

906
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,080
I'm so touched.

907
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,160
It really

908
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,960
has been many years since I ate the pancake of my hometown.

909
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,000
Instructor.

910
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,520
It's late. We should go now.

911
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,080
Okay.

912
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,760
Don't worry. Go back now.

913
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,480
I have nothing important.

914
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,320
My battalion just reached the station point

915
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,360
and there are many things to do.

916
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,120
I have to go too.

917
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,120
I have a thing to ask you.

918
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,520
I heard from Xia Lin

919
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,520
you swore that

920
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,480
if you failed the challenge,

921
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,240
you would take off the uniform and leave the force.

922
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,480
Yes.

923
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,640
Can you really give up?

924
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,360
I can't.

925
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,560
When I

926
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,200
got off the train

927
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,360
at Zhangmu Train Station in uniform,

928
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,320
I was young and inexperienced.

929
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,240
I didn't know what the uniform meant for me.

930
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,360
For over a decade,

931
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,000
I've been through rough times.

932
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,560
As He Dazhuang put it,

933
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,640
the military uniform is not mere clothes

934
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,800
but another layer of my skin

935
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,920
that holds my soul together.

936
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,080
If anyone wants to take off my military uniform,

937
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,120
it will be as painful as tearing down my skin.

938
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,040
Then why did you make the oath?

939
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,000
Place somebody on a field of death and he will fight to live.

940
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,320
This is a decisive battle

941
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,720
that involves a soldier's honor.

942
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,080
I can't lose.

943
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,000
And I can't leave myself an alternative way.

944
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,760
My brothers will know that

945
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,400
if we can't be the best soldiers

946
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,520
and be the ace troop,

947
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,880
it will just be a waste

948
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,600
of the country's rice

949
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,920
and people's money to stay.

950
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,560
If so, we should leave the army, right?

951
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,280
With that belief,

952
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,160
I'm sure you'll win.

953
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,480
Thank you, Chunyu.

954
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,440
After I'm back,

955
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,640
Nanzheng and you should invite me for a meal.

956
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,640
Sure.

957
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:49,960
Sergeant Han, goodbye.

958
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,520
Sir, we've arrived at the mission site.

959
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,840
You four go check the line over there.

960
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,440
Yes.

961
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,120
Other people follow me.

962
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,000
The breakpoint is here. Fix it quickly.

963
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:44,960
Yes.

964
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,520
Section Chief Xia,

965
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,120
it's said that your appointment

966
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,400
as the colonel of Regiment 720

967
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,640
has been granted by the corps.

968
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,600
You're only waiting for the approval of the military district.

969
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,640
Where did you hear the news?

970
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,280
The news has already made the rounds in the military office.

971
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,600
We're waiting for you to invite us for a good meal.

972
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:19,720
Sure.

973
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,240
I'll plan a good meal someday.

974
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,360
You promise it.

975
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,120
I'll keep it in mind.

976
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,600
Hello, operation duty room.

977
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,400
What?

978
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,280
Please repeat and I'll take it down.

979
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,080
Got it. I'll report to the military chief immediately.

980
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,440
What happened?

981
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,480
One group of the troubleshooting team

982
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,600
sent by the communication department to No. 5 Defense Communication Line

983
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,360
lost contact.

984
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,400
When they searched for rescue,

985
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,840
one soldier stepped on the mine and died

986
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,360
and another's leg was blown up.

987
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,000
What?

988
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,120
Mt. Guier?

989
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,160
Yes.
