1
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:45,080
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,140
You know what that scent is?

3
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,780
Premium floral water for females.

4
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,380
Impossible!

5
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:43,180
It...

6
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,580
This place it can only be

7
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,940
hair sebum.

8
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,740
How is it floral water?

9
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:49,700
Staff officer Chen.

10
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,460
Yes sir.

11
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:51,820
According to the rules,

12
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:52,940
give him -3 scores.

13
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,060
Please don't!

14
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,100
Chief Song.

15
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,580
How can you be sure it's floral water?

16
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,259
A-a-and

17
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:00,340
for female?

18
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,980
The service agency my wife work at

19
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,820
sells this floral water.

20
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,620
She uses it herself.

21
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,740
Nobody knows it

22
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,940
better than me.

23
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,539
Enough.

24
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,500
Quit denying

25
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,100
and find out

26
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,460
which female soldier

27
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,579
was in this dorm,

28
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,100
and what happened

29
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:20,500
on top of that bed.

30
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,340
You know it better than me

31
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,700
how big the trouble is.

32
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:25,500
Chief Song.

33
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,420
Chief Song.

34
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,500
Soldiers are all here.

35
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,980
Don't make things over-complicated.

36
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,700
I'm gonna find out right now.

37
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,620
- Go find it out.
- Right away.

38
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,420
Go.

39
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,540
Niu Mancang!

40
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,500
Yes sir.

41
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,780
Spit it out! Which female soldier was on this bed?

42
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,860
I'm innocent, commander!

43
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,780
It's impossible!

44
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,300
Gu yiye laid on my bed

45
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,340
for a while this afternoon,

46
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,740
and that's it!

47
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:58,780
Gu Yiye,

48
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,420
You used floral water?

49
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,780
Sir,

50
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,020
I have not.

51
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,660
Then where's the smell from?

52
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:21,620
Why are you so nervous?

53
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,579
You were not this nervous

54
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:24,660
when you were at the division HQ.

55
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,740
Are you hiding something?

56
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,060
I, I am not.

57
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,500
Then why are you so nervous?

58
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,380
Sir.

59
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,940
Here's the thing.

60
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,700
- This afternoon.
- Report.

61
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,780
Here's the thing.

62
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,500
The floral water thing...

63
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,740
it was me.

64
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,180
You?

65
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:51,340
Yes.

66
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,260
Niu Mancang's feet stink so much

67
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,220
that we can't sleep at night.

68
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:57,060
We don't want it to

69
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,180
affect the hygiene competition.

70
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,180
and I bought some floral water,

71
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,940
dropped some in his shoes,

72
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:02,900
and tried to cover the odor.

73
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,340
Where did you get the floral water?

74
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,740
Sargent sent me to the service agency this afternoon,

75
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,580
and I bought it there.

76
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,460
Where is it?

77
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,060
It's...

78
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,540
in his cabinet.

79
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,540
Get it.

80
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,300
Yes sir.

81
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,420
Smell it please.

82
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,660
I wasn't expecting

83
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,620
you being so tasteful.

84
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,500
Here's a quote I loved:

85
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,020
It's nothing

86
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,260
to thrive into a big tree in the forest,

87
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,500
but it's pride

88
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,060
in a desert.

89
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,780
Let's do it together.

90
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,140
Be quick washing up after the morning exercise.

91
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,020
There's a formation contest today.

92
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:18,380
[Who's the hero and who's the brave man? Let's match in the training ground.]

93
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,540
Formation contest is now on

94
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,340
by the unit of company.

95
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,380
Each company

96
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,940
[Training for the outstanding soldiers.]

97
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,940
will choose a squad

98
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,900
representing the whole company.

99
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,940
They will be scored immediately after.

100
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,180
First Company, start!

101
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,860
Right turn!

102
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,540
Double march!

103
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,500
Left, right, left.

104
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,340
Left, right, left.

105
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,580
Left, right, left.

106
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,659
Halt!

107
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,620
Goose step, march!

108
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,220
Halt!

109
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,120
- Not bad.
- Turn left!

110
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,460
Goose step, march!

111
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,300
Halt!

112
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,980
Left turn!

113
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,620
Third Company, start!

114
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,100
Comrade examiner,

115
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,140
Third Company reporting for duty!

116
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,420
Please give order!

117
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,100
Which squad do you choose?

118
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,420
Third Company will ALL participate!

119
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:24,660
Good.

120
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,100
Start!

121
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,060
Goose step, march!

122
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,520
Left, right, left.

123
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,170
- One, two, one.
- Third Company go! Third Company Prevail!

124
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,100
Third Company go! Third Company Prevail!

125
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,340
Third Company go! Third Company Prevail!

126
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:48,900
Third Company go! Third Company Prevail!

127
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,659
Brother.

128
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,659
Under the cheers of female comrades-in-arm,

129
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,900
we won the first prize.

130
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,580
Our comrades-in arms

131
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,100
are like freshly maintained shells,

132
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,300
all ready up.

133
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,420
Time in the new recruit company is intense, but short.

134
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,100
I'm about to join the company,

135
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,140
[Proud of a peaceful motherland, happy for a wealthy society.]

136
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,900
and I feel hard to let go.

137
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,540
♫ Unity is strength ♫

138
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,300
♫ This power is iron ♫

139
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,780
♫ This force is steel ♫

140
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,620
♫ One two three four ♫

141
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,020
♫ Fire upon Fascism ♫

142
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,260
♫ One two three four ♫

143
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,660
♫ To the sun, and to the freedom ♫

144
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,540
♫ To the new country ♫

145
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,179
Company Commander Zhao.

146
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:33,419
Thanks for today.

147
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,059
If not for the cheers

148
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:36,140
of your female soldiers,

149
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,740
We couldn't have won.

150
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,500
You're welcome, Company Commander Qin.

151
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:43,220
But a victory won by hormones,

152
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,300
is not a true one.

153
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,340
It's not gonna work on the battlefield.

154
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,380
Do you know

155
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,540
what's the advantage of Lu Pingfan?

156
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,260
It's us who won today.

157
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,380
You won for your momentum and unity.

158
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,060
And the shock to the examiners.

159
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,020
But do not be fooled

160
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,020
by such illusion.

161
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,820
Thanks for the advice.

162
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,740
I'm glad you can think in my shoe like this.

163
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,100
We are all training new recruits and learning from each other.

164
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:15,660
It's our duty.

165
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,940
But you haven't told me

166
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,940
the advantage of Lu Pingfan.

167
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:22,580
Their pace.

168
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,860
They have a better pace than you.

169
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,260
Their formation

170
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,020
has a trace-less rhythm.

171
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,700
It's cultivated.

172
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,100
Are you saying that

173
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,540
I'm uncultivated?

174
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,500
I did not.

175
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,700
I have something to tell you.

176
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,620
What about we

177
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,820
make a celebration before we join companies.

178
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,660
We're neighbours for 3 months.

179
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,220
Let's say our farewell.

180
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,540
Okay.

181
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,820
Maybe my soldiers will tell yours

182
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,020
about pace and rhythm.

183
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,020
Good.

184
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,580
Go have lunch.

185
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:09,900
[New recruits company, comrades friendship. Go hand in hand for a bright future.]

186
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,460
♫ The sun is like a golden shuttle ♫

187
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,420
♫ and the moon is like a silver shuttle♫

188
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,460
♫ One for you ♫

189
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,340
♫ and one for me ♫

190
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,700
♫ Weaving a beautiful life together ♫

191
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,580
The whole company is celebrating.

192
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,580
And here I am, cooking for the chiefs.

193
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,180
That Qin the Cannon

194
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,700
must be retaliating good soldiers.

195
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,220
What, now you're bragging

196
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,260
just because they took you seriously?

197
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,500
I'm telling you,

198
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,540
If you didn't tell the company commander

199
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,940
that you've learned from a chef,

200
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,180
he's not gonna drag you here.

201
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,700
Well, I didn't brag about it.

202
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,860
I really did learn from a chef.

203
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,780
In fancy terms,

204
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,740
I'm competent for both military and civilian services.

205
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,660
What, now you mimic my accent?

206
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,060
Keep bragging.

207
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,900
I'm gonna see

208
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,300
what you got here.

209
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,060
So?

210
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,100
Gotta admit, not bad.

211
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,700
That's for sure.

212
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,340
I'm telling you,

213
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,900
our company won the first prize this time

214
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:20,820
so that

215
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,580
the company commander recommended you.

216
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,700
Don't waste this chance.

217
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,060
I'm just gonna

218
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,940
leave this chance to you guys.

219
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,820
I'm out.

220
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,900
Alright.

221
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:35,440
Let's bring out the dishes.

222
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:36,940
All right.

223
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,700
[Never shed tears even for bloody sweat. Never be left behind even being peeled of the meat.]

224
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:02,940
♫ Always on our minds ♫

225
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:08,060
♫ It's an ordinary wish ♫

226
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:15,340
[New recruits company, comrades friendship. Go hand in hand for a bright future.]

227
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:13,020
♫ May my hometown be beautiful ♫

228
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:18,180
♫ May the motherland live forever ♫

229
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:23,140
♫ Listen to the snow and wind ♫

230
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:28,020
♫ Watch the meteor flying ♫

231
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:32,980
♫ My heart calls to me ♫

232
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:37,300
♫ Rush to the turbulent distance ♫

233
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,900
♫ Even if there is disaster after disaster ♫

234
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:47,340
♫ It can't make us decadent ♫

235
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:52,540
♫ Let's be friends ♫

236
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,580
♫ We will always have strength ♫

237
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:02,580
♫ Listen to the snow and wind ♫

238
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:07,460
♫ Watch the meteor flying ♫

239
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:12,500
♫ My heart calls to me ♫

240
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,660
♫ Rush to the turbulent distance ♫

241
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,860
The Third Company of new recruits

242
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,220
won the first place

243
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,660
in the queue training evaluation.

244
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,740
This is good.

245
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,460
I'm telling you,

246
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,540
the next time you do this,

247
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,180
I'll count you as cheating.

248
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,780
Even using female soldiers as a shield.

249
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,820
I know.

250
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,780
There were

251
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,300
a couple of other judges

252
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,900
who gave us sympathy points this time.

253
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,780
On the worse side,

254
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,100
we are not strong enough to win.

255
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,340
On the bright side,

256
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:11,980
we call it

257
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,740
uniting all forces that can be united.

258
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,780
I praised you a few words.

259
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,660
Why are you so proud?

260
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,940
If I hadn't

261
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,860
scored an extra 0.05 points for your squad,

262
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,860
you would never have won the first place.

263
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,700
You are absolutely right.

264
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,620
Wait, wait a minute.

265
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,300
Drinking in the company has a bad influence.

266
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,780
Well, next time, then.

267
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,220
A small amount of wine is fine.

268
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:50,940
Just a small amount.

269
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,100
That's right! We're not on duty anyway.

270
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:53,700
A small amount.

271
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,660
All right.

272
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,860
To be honest,

273
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,460
I have always been a little nervous about

274
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,900
male and female recruits being so close.

275
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,460
They are all young and hot-blooded.

276
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,860
I'm afraid something will happen.

277
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,940
When something goes wrong, it's a big deal.

278
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,580
Chief Song,

279
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,140
what do you mean?

280
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,700
In the military,

281
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,540
discipline must be a priority.

282
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,460
But the good news is,

283
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,380
it's almost over.

284
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,020
The new recruits will join the company soon.
Cheers.

285
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:35,860
Okay, that's it for today.

286
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,460
Leave the heavy stuff to tomorrow.

287
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:43,460
[Diligent and thrifty, against waste.]

288
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,020
- Mancang, stop it. Go back to sleep. - Yes sir.

289
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,390
Get him!

290
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,500
Turn off the lights.

291
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,260
Where is Gao?

292
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,340
Where did Gao go?

293
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:12,180
[New recruits company, comrades friendship. Go hand in hand for a bright future.]

294
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,500
The comrades of new recruit company,

295
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,260
how are you doing.

296
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:38,820
Next,

297
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:42,140
the new recruit company

298
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,820
to present a song

299
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,780
called the Song of Comrades

300
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,780
Let's welcome.

301
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:55,420
♫ We are comrades, as close as brothers ♫

302
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:59,180

♫ To win the victory ♫

326
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,660
By the way,

327
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,140
there's one thing I wonder.

328
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,900
Zhao Hongying's father

329
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,780
is the former chief of
our division commander.

330
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,140
You don't know about this?

331
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,380
Lu Pingfan is chasing her.

332
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,640
You don't know either, right?

333
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:53,940
Seriously?

334
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,100
Listen to me.

335
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,160
Qin the Cannon.

336
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,140
Don't be such a brute.

337
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,220
You can't just focus on the company.

338
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,540
How can you progress

339
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,300
and win battles

340
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,790
if you don't know anything?

341
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,320
However,

342
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,240
Company Commander Zhao

343
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,140
is helping you today.

344
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,560
I can see that.

345
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,940
You think I'm vulgar, right?

346
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,300
But

347
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,780
that's the way it is.

348
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,660
A little more information wouldn't hurt.

349
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,100
This is not a dish made by old Pickle.

350
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,260
Is there a new chef?

351
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:40,900
Here's the thing.

352
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,500
Gao Liang always boasted to me that

353
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,120
he could cook big meals,

354
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,580
so today I gave him a chance

355
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,460
to show his cooking skills.

356
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,100
Is it not tasty?

357
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,740
Next time,
I'll let old Pickle make it up to you.

358
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:51,980
It was Gao Liang.

359
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,900
You wear out iron shoes in hunting round,

360
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,460
must come all not to time-consuming.

361
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,020
A few days ago, Deputy Minister You of
the Logistics Department

362
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,020
asked me

363
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,580
if there were any cooks with better skills.

364
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,700
They intend to transfer two new recruits

365
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,940
to the military authorities.

366
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:10,580
Well, that's great.

367
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,740
When the new recruits join the company,

368
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,860
I'll take Gao Liang with me.

369
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:14,820
No, no, no.

370
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,100
You can't do that, Chief Song.

371
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,220
Why?

372
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,300
Gao Liang is not the cooking soldier.

373
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,380
He was temporarily assigned to
make this meal.

374
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,780
Can't he be changed into a cooking soldier?

375
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,220
Gao Liang does not want to be
a cooking soldier.

376
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,940
Revolutionary soldiers are bricks

377
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,460
that should be moved
wherever they are needed.

378
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,300
No.

379
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,220
Chief Song.

380
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,940
Gao Liang's military qualities stand out,

381
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,860
making him a good fighter and

382
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:36,980
a promising candidate.

383
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,140
You mean,

384
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,860
there's no future as a cooking soldier?

385
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,540
Have you ever asked him

386
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,380
if he wanted to go to military authorities or
the company?

387
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:46,940
Come on.

388
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,980
Please pick someone else, anyone you want.

389
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,940
Just leave him with me, okay?

390
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,460
Well.

391
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,420
Fine.

392
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,100
I'm not gonna pressure you
with higher authority.

393
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,540
However,

394
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,780
I also hope that you will not
use your thoughts

395
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,900
to crush your soldiers.

396
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,780
It's late,

397
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,540
I'm gotta go.

398
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:15,540
[No. 1]

399
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,740
Hey, it's me.

400
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,780
Gu Yiye.

401
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,500
Did you ask for leave?

402
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,500
Of course.

403
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,570
That kick you just kicked,

404
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,580
it was powerful

405
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,700
and responsive.

406
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,540
Looks like the three-month-training in the new recruit company

407
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,460
is not wasted.

408
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,260
It's just you're getting less bold.

409
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:42,980
Why didn't you move at all,

410
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,060
and didn't even hide,

411
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:44,940
like a rock.

412
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:51,900
I,

413
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,820
I have something

414
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,140
to say to you.

415
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,500
You were assigned to division headquarters,

416
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,180
and it's harder for us comrades

417
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,700
to meet.

418
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,460
We are both soldiers,

419
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,740
if you don't have any special things,

420
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,140
we don't have to meet.

421
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,500
We won't always be soldiers.

422
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:10,940
I'll look for chances

423
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,260
to go to the division headquarters to see you.

424
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,100
Becoming a giant tree in the forest

425
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,180
does not mean anything.

426
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,220
Becoming a giant tree in the desert

427
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,460
is something worth being proud of.

428
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,380
That's what you told me,

429
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,380
and I've always kept it in my heart.

430
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,540
It's my goal and motivation.

431
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,700
We'll fight together.

432
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,120
Follow him.

433
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,700
Comrade Jiang Nanzheng.

434
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,620
This is for you as a souvenir.

435
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,910
What is this?

436
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,380
A poem collection I copied.

437
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,180
Just let our friendship

438
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,900
be tested by time,

439
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,820
and let the military

440
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,740
test ourselves.

441
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,540
Yangtze River, Yangtze River, this is Yellow River.

442
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,580
Nanzheng Nanzheng (Conquer South), this is Beizhan (fight North).

443
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,660
It's Gao Liang.

444
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,300
You should go now.

445
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,020
He's edgy, don't let him see you.

446
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,340
Go, go!

447
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,800
- This lummox again.
- Hurry back.

448
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,860
Go go go, he'll be here soon.

449
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,500
Hurry, hurry!

450
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,340
Hurry, he's coming!

451
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,660
Jiang Nanzheng,

452
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,000
I see you.

453
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,730
Did you ask for leave when you came out?

454
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,170
Of course I did.

455
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,860
Why are you here alone?

456
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,620
Watching the stars again?

457
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,820
Aren't you afraid of wild boars?

458
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,940
You're more terrifying than them.

459
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,140
You can read in this darkness?

460
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:26,620
What book is it?

461
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,340
You won't understand.

462
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,420
I won't understand?

463
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,660
I'm telling you I'm well educated.

464
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:34,580
Let me see.

465
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,820
You give it back!

466
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,220
Can you reach it?

467
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:39,860
You can't.

468
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,700
Give me back!

469
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,500
Stop it, Gao Liang.

470
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,540
Give me back.

471
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,140
You're so nervous.

472
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,260
There must be something about it.

473
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,420
Gao Liang I'm telling this again,

474
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,140
we are just common comrades in arms.

475
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,140
Alright.

476
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,300
Do you have a brother?

477
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,900
Why not let me be your brother?

478
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,060
You don't have to hate me so much.

479
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,340
Here's a mango for you.

480
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:32,980
Keep it.

481
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:41,900
It's so big.

482
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:46,820
Smells great.

483
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,620
But...

484
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,100
No but! I'm begging you.

485
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,740
Just take me as your brother,

486
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,940
as a relative of yours.

487
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,780
Whenever I see something delicious, I think about you,

488
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,740
and I want to take it to you.

489
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,780
I was afraid

490
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,820
that this kind of things of bad taste would happen,

491
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,900
and now it happens.

492
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,620
Right under my nose!

493
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,980
Right on you Qin Hanyong's turf.

494
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,740
New recruits in romantic relations.

495
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,750
Oh my goodness.

496
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,620
Why don't you just raise hell?

497
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,780
Do you realize how serious this is?

498
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,620
You know what kind of punishment

499
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,780
you'll be receiving?

500
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:36,940
Sir,

501
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,620
we are not in a relationship.

502
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,540
Yes, we are not.

503
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,100
I was hoping, you can ask if she agrees.

504
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:42,860
No.

505
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,820
See, she's not willing to.

506
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,500
What is this? What's this about?

507
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,220
Who are you trying to conceive?

508
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,740
Acting for me?

509
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:50,780
Sir,

510
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,420
I'm just trying to explain the situation.

511
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,460
I'm not asking you.

512
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,860
I'll get back to you later.

513
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,020
Completely out of line!

514
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,460
[For comrade Jiang Nanzheng. Comrade G.]

515
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:14,700
To comrade Jiang Nanzheng.

516
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,580
Comrade

517
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,940
[For comrade Jiang Nanzheng. Comrade G.]

518
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,020
G

519
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,020
Gao.

520
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,140
Bad taste.

521
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,520
You wrote all these?

522
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,860
I did.

523
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,180
Chief Song, don't you look down on me.

524
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,180
I'm actually really well-educated.

525
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,780
This is what I wrote to Jiang Nanzheng.

526
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,900
And she won't take it.

527
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,060
I forced her to keep it.

528
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,140
Then she just wouldn't receive it.

529
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,100
I did this all by myself.

530
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,140
She has nothing to do with it.

531
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,220
Gao Liang, you

532
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,060
you shut up. I'll come to you later.

533
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,990
You wrote this?

534
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,180
Fine, come here.

535
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,340
I'll just turn to one random page,

536
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:00,780
you read it for me.

537
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:01,940
Yes, sir.

538
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,900
Loafe with me on the grass,

539
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,100
Lose the stop from your throat,

540
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,980
[We're lying on the grassland lazily...]

541
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,580
Lose the stop from your throat,

542
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,380
Not words,

543
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,940
not music or rhyme I want,

544
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,540
Only the lull I like,

545
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:37,220
the hum of your

546
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,300
valved voice.

547
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,660
Come in.

548
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:43,700
Chief Song.

549
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:45,900
Company Commander Zhao.

550
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,300
You are just in time.

551
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,420
Let's admire

552
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,630
what your subordinate did together.

553
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,000
Come on, read.

554
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,660
I mind how once we lay

555
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,500
such a transparent summer morning,

556
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,060
[Remember another brisk morning...]

557
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,620
How you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn'd over upon me,

558
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,340
And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone...

559
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,830
Oh my god.

560
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,380
The severeness of the situation

561
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,660
is completely beyond my imagination.

562
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,740
Alright, stop it.

563
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,580
Chief Song,

564
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,070
this is Song of Myself

565
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:30,160
written by Walt Whitman.

566
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,340
It's really classic.

567
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:33,760
It's from Leaves of Grass.

568
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,200
They are too young,

569
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,980
so they can't express that sense.

570
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,460
You have to forgive them.

571
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,440
Whitman, right?

572
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,620
Whitman!

573
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,260
Even Whitman

574
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,380
can't unbutton other's buttons everywhere.

575
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,420
Right.

576
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,060
Even I flashed!

577
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,380
Em,

578
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,700
Chief Song,

579
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,460
you're familiar with military affairs.

580
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,580
You're experienced in disciplines.

581
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,020
Rest assured,

582
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,340
I and Company Commander Zhao

583
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,220
will investigate the real situation

584
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,740
as soon as possible

585
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,300
and report to you.

586
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,020
If it's really like what you said,

587
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,300
we'll take care of it seriously.

588
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,700
Qin Hanyong,

589
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,580
I trust provosts' eyes.

590
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,060
It's not about your investigation

591
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,380
or reports right now.

592
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,380
Discipline comes first.

593
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,140
This

594
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,420
must be investigated

595
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,740
and dealt with

596
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,180
by colonel office directly.

597
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,540
Jiang Nanzheng, follow me and return to the company.

598
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,500
What are you doing standing still?

599
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,460
Talk to me.

600
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,140
What really happened?

601
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:22,920
Company commander,

602
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,180
I promise you,

603
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:28,980
what happened today

604
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,260
has nothing to do with this mango.

605
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,140
The mango is innocent!

606
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:37,940
No.

[Improve awareness for the assessment which develops abilities.]

608
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,020
You're free to go.

609
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,740
You've got morning exercises tomorrow.

610
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,500
Company commander,

611
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,500
why don't you ask me something?

612
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,380
Ask you about what?

613
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:19,500
Ask if you are violating discipline,

614
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,180
if you are in a relationship with Gao Liang?

615
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,300
I don't ask you because I believe in you.

616
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:29,220
[Struck root in the camp]

617
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:27,940
And,

618
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,140
that soldier named Gao Liang,

619
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,140
he wouldn't have known about Whitman's poems.

620
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,580
So he couldn't have copied it down and gave it to you.

621
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,300
You don't have to tell me who wrote it.

622
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,500
I'm not curious.

623
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,620
But I've got an advice for you,

624
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,220
as a friend.

625
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,460
Boys who like Whitman's poetry

626
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,100
are usually arrogant,

627
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,300
they are outstanding and sharp.

628
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,660
You need to protect yourself

629
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,180
from getting hurt.

630
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,260

has already learned about your recruits.

633
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,980
I recommended you.

634
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,740
So I don't want you

635
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,340
to be affected by this.

636
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,620
Understand?

637
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:21,900
Go back then.

[Struck root in the camp]

639
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,620
Gao will be miserable this time.

640
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,740
So the training model is a waste.

641
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:02,980
We don't even know where

642
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,620
we'll be assigned to feed the pigs.

643
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,900
If he goes to feed the pigs, it is the pigs who are tormented.

644
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,940
How can you guys do this?

645
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,500
How can you guys do this?

646
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,260
We are a team.

647
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,659
We've been three months together.

648
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,659
How can you be so cold-hearted?

649
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,739
Who can he blame for?

650
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,540
He can only blame for himself.

Not only was he found out,

655
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,100
but he also got Jiang Nanzheng involved.

656
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:29,300
We are in a military.

657
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,260

who leaves such a reputation

659

will have a bad impact on her future.

Do you guys think

661
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,100
Jiang Nanzheng is

662
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,940
really into Gao Liang?

663
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:46,900
Great.

I can even hear you guys outside the door.

Why are you guys so quiet when the provosts were here?

- Nothing.

00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,180
How was she?

00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,020
What the company commander said?

683

You're the one who caused the trouble, ask them yourself.

Run!

688
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:09,540
I'm asking you,

689
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,460
how far has your relationship progressed?

00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,540
Hug?

692
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,660
Or kissing?

693
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,660
Reporting to the company commander,

694
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,660
you, as a company commander,

695
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,900
you can't insult me.

696
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,700
I confessed it to you

697
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,900
out of trust.

698
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,260
Please respect our relationship.

699
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,100
Our relationship is about mutual appreciation,

and common progress.

702
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,540
Am I insulting you?

703
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,100
And what relationship was that?

704
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:39,940
Sit down,

705
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,460
did she say she is fond of you?

706
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,220
No.

707
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:49,860
No?

708
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,140
And dare you say what,

709
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,220
"our relationship"?

710
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,940
Who do you think you are?

711
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,820
Few poems can make you feel awesome?

712
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,540
Sending a book will make you two be in love for a life?

713
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,140
Gu Yiye,

714
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,100
Do you know what the biggest

715
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:03,660
problem in you is?

716
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,940
Self-righteousness, self-inflation,

717
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,980
Self-interest, pretentiousness.

718
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,020
Company commander,

719
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:12,900
I think

720
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,700
your eloquence has improved.

721
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,330
I...

722
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,540
Don't be mad.

723
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,940
Go on, go on.

724
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:20,990
Take your foot bath.

725
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,180
I'm warning you.

726
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,460
This is a serious breach of discipline.

727
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,020
You have to keep your feelings

728
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,260
buried in your heart.

729
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,690
Keep it to you.

730
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,360
Don't go to her.

731
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,540
Expressly forbidden.

732
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,030
This is discipline.

733
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,380
Then I'll ask the chief to explain the situation.

734
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,220
Do you want to torment yourself

735
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,850
or do you want to torment others?

736
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,340
This is a high-pressure line, people who touch it die.

737
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,140
Do you know that?

738
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,620
Does it affect our distribution?

739
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,540
Gu Yiye,

740
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,340
you're so naive.

741
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,140
Distribution is nothing

742
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,980
compared to being out of the military.

743
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,060
I'm telling you,

744
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,820
that girl can say she has no idea of it,

745
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,380
but that poetry,

746
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,820
it wasn't coming out of nowhere.

747
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,620
Think about it,

748
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,620
it's you be the one who take the responsibility,

749
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,660
or Gao Liang.

750
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,300
Where are you going?

751
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,580
I don't want to get discharged,

752
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,180
and I don't want to avoid responsibility either.

753
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,020
Just stay in the army

754
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,420
if you don't want to get discharged.

755
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,980
Be well disciplined in the army.

756
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,140
You so-called intellectual youths,

757
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,820
are so stubborn.

758
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,340
What you gonna do now,

759
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,300
is to take a deep think of it,

760
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,380
ask yourself,

761
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,900
what exactly do you want?

762
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,300
Do you want to be a

763
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,020
good soldier in the army,

764
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,300
or you want that so-called relationship,

765
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,180
vowed romantic relationship?

766
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,020
Or what free-spirited personality?

767
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,100
My dream

768
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,020
it's not just about being a good soldier.

769
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,420
Many people come to the army

770
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,420
to make themselves better,

771
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,420
more tenacious and braver,

772
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,700
more masculine.

773
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,340
But what I'm after is

774
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,020
I was able to make

775
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,580
the army wiser,

776
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,340
stronger, and more powerful through my own efforts.

777
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,740
I will fight for this dream for the rest of my life.

778
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,060
And I know,

779
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,340
what sounds to you

780
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,180
might be really crazy,

781
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,340
I shou'dn't tell you these.

782
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,340
Bu' I'm afraid that you might be worried about me

783
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,180
if I keep it to myself.

784
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,060
Now you had spit it out to me,

785
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,540
I'm even more worried.

786
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:54,900
[Who knows the dishes food, each grain is hard.]

787
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,660
I have a stomachache.

788
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:24,780
Give you potatoes.

789
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,540
Sergeant, I have a stomachache.

790
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,860
Let me finish this.

791
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,180
Hurry up.

792
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,540
When you're done eating,

793
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,940
someone comes into the kitchen to help.

794
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,300
Okay.

795
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,500
Let go.

796
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,380
Let go.

797
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,580
Let go of me!

798
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,780
I have something to say to Jiang.

799
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,140
I have something to say to her too. I'll pass it on for you.

800
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,180
If you dare to go, I will call the class monitor.

801
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,060
How can you be so shameless?

802
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,460
Thank you for the compliment.

803
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,220
Let go.

804
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:38,900
Sergeant.

805
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,670
Eat some potatoes.

806
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,620
[Saving water is everyone's responsibility]

807
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,900
[Who knows the dishes food, each grain is hard.]

808
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,820
[Saving water is everyone's responsibility]

809
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:55,940
Well,

810
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,460
you stay here to help for ten minutes.

811
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,340
What happened?

812
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,900
Nothing, I'm gonna eat it.

813
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:18,580
Jiang,

814
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,100
I came to apologize to you.

815
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,060
Why apologize to me?

816
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,380
The people you should really apologize to

817
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,060
are Gao Liang and Company Commander Qin.

818
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,260
I've apologized to company commander.

819
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,460
As to Gao Liang,

820
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,580
I have plenty of time and opportunity to talk to him.

821
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,340
Jiang,

822
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,660
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

823
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,420
I didn't step up and

824
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,260
take responsibility

825
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,060
in the first place.

826
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,380
You don't have to say sorry to me.

827
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,900
You didn't affect me.

828
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,420
And,

829
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,660
We don't have to say sorry to each other.
