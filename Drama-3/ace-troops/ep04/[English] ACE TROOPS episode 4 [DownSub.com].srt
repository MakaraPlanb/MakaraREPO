00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,259
Gu Yiye!

3
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:37,180
Yiye!

4
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,380
Gu Yiye!

5
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,460
Yiye!

6
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:41,740
Everything's fine?

7
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,900
Great.

8
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,020
What are you doing?

9
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,259
I'm going to the division commander's.

10
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,060
He's not around.

11
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,140
Then I'll wait for him.

12
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,140
There's no point in doing this.

13
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,460
Then what should I do?

14
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,580
Alright,

15
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,540
we all saw your act just now.

16
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,620
The division commander won't like it.

17
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,020
Act?

18
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,460
I wasn't acting!

19
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,060
I joined the army with great ambition,

20
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,380
and I even gave up gaokao.

21
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,260
For all these years,

22
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,740
I've been preparing

23
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,780
to become a soldier.

24
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,440
I trained infantry technique by myself,

25
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,300
and did physical training.

26
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,140
I learnt military history on my own,

27
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,300
and taught myself tactical knowledge.

28
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,020
I am more suited to the army than anyone else!

29
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,370
How could you say I'm not the one?

30
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:30,380
How could you make me retire?

31
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,390
And what?

32
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,700
And,

33
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,980
I know I should not be

34
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,340
saying these now,

35
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,660
but they are stuck in my throat.

36
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,820
Even it’s just acting,

37
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,260
please let me see the division commander

38
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:46,700
and finish my lines.

39
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,820
It's already time for you to bow and step down.

40
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,900
Lines?

41
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,100
They used to call me a book worm,

42
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,300
but I say you are the book nerd!

43
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,460
Have your father told you

44
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,860
the difference between military institutes and common colleges?

45
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,860
At the artillery reconnaissance class,

46
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,980
he once said

47
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,060
that we investigate functions for the death,

48
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,220
and use cannons

49
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,380
to write them down.

50
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,220
This is the difference

51
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,460
between military institutes and common colleges.

52
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,220
Common colleges teach knowledge,

53
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,660
but military institutes

54
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,900
put what you’ve learnt into practice

55
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,420
by blood and fire.

56
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:20,660
You,

57
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,940
you might have more knowlegde than others,

58
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,420
but in the class filled with blood and flames,

59
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,180
destined for iron and volition,

60
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,660
you don't have advantages

61
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,020
to anyone else.

62
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,980
To you,

63
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,980
this is a test,

64
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,220
a test of life.

65
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,140
Soldiers are special individuals.

66
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,900
Maybe one can be here

67
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,060
out of their love towards military,

68
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,579
but they definitely can't

69
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:51,100
stand all the way through with their initial enthusiasm.

70
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,300
Of course loving to be a soldier is great,

71
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,820
but you need more than just passion

72
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,420
to wear this uniform.

73
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,140
If you can't understand this,

74
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,220
leaving right now

75
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,940
might be a good choice.

76
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,500
I'll never leave.

78
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:12,900
Excuse me,

79
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,300
have you seen

80
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,660
a tall, thin new recruit?

81
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,660
His name is Gu Yiye.

82
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,700
No. Comrade,

83
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,500
you can't enter here.

84
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,740
Comrade,

85
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,340
Gu Yiye is fine,

86
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,140
you can go back now.

87
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,940
Did you ask for leave?

88
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,340
Running around like this.

89
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,540
Hurry up and go back to your troop.

90
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,580
Yes, Sir.

91

94
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,020
Gao, you see,

95
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,460
you are about to retire to local.

96
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,780
You really should work hard,

97
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,860
and be that ten-thousand-yuan household.

98
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,180
Gao,

99
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,180
I do know a way

100
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,340
to let you stay in the military.

101
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,740
Just marry a woman soldier,

102
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,820
then you get to be a soldier's dependant!

103
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,260
Piss off!

104
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,380
Yeah,

105
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,140
that's a way.

106
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,460
Stop pretending!

107

All of us saw clearly that

108
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,780
you just like that woman soldier

whose family name is Jiang, right?

110
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,980
Really?

111
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,860
Stop it. I'm telling you,

112
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,780
that's just revolution friendship.

113
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,580
Now that I'm not going to stay in military,

114
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,980
this revolution friendship should stop here.

115

Niu,

116
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,940
- These clothes... - What?

117
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,100
Gao.

118
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,980
- I don’t need them anyway. - No.

119
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,980
You can keep this uniform

120
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,180
as a souvenir.

121
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,540

without a red star

123
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,820
and two red flags on

124
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:35,980
is really a pity.

00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,500
it smells.

129
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,140

why are you all following me.

Dear comrades,

146
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,540
you said goodbye to your friends and family,

147
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,940
leaving home for military.

148
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,420
That's devotion.

149
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,060
But me,

150
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,060
I came to the military alone,

151
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,659
to seek refuge.

152
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,900
You don't know

153
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,700
that I'm the one

154
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,380
who has nowhere else to go.

155
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:46,980
And now,

156
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,940
I'm leaving you.

157
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,620

158
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,540
where are you?

159
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,100
I miss you.

160
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,460
Deserter from the new recruit company?

161
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,460
Had a cramp.

00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,660
Who wears that suit to swim?

163
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,980
There's no way you can swim.

164
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,500
I'm fishing here this afternoon,

165
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,900
and I saw you hemming and hawing

166
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,100
right here in the water.

167
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,980
You made me

168
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,060
stare at you for hours,

169
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,020
and I can't even fish.

170
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,980
You are an old soldier, right?

171
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,420
Have you fought in a war?

172
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,300
I’ve faced some enemies.

173
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,500
But I still can't be compared

174
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,580
with those veterans.

175
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,580
Then you are half the known kind.

176
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,740
I'll tell you something about our maneuver.

177
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,580
You haven't eaten anything all day, so you must be hungry.

178
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,700
There are two eggs in the bag,

179
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,420
go ahead and eat.

180
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,580
Yiye,

181
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,560
the girl at the train station last time,

182
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,700
was she your girlfriend?

183
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,140
No.

184
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,340
No?

185
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,020
I saw her crying real hard,

186
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,380
so she must like you very much.

187
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,220
Actually,

188
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,780
being a soldier is not like a monk,

189
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,540
you don't have to be like that.

190
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,500
I know,

191
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,620
but I'm so determined to be a soldier.

192
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,140
I can't hurt her.

193
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,740
Way to go, really ruthless.

194
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,820
But, speaking of this,

195
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,500
being in a relationship with a soldier

196
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,700
is really not easy.

197
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,620
Few girls

198
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,860
can be compared with my Xiu.

199
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,860
Xiu? Who's Xiu?

200
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,060
My girlfriend.

201
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,180
We've been together for 2 years.

202
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,940
I'm not afraid of being a joke.

203
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,340
We only met 3 times.

204
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,380
After we get back,

205
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,140
I'll show you her picture.

206
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,900
She's really beautiful.

207
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,500
I originally thought this time,

208
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,090
after teaching you guys,

209
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,980
I'll take time off to get married.

210
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,560
Now,

211
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,820
not in the mood for anything.

212
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,100
Sergeant,

213
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,460
we are retired.

214
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,500
So we won't affect your selection of the honored sergeant.

215
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,500
Do you think I should

216
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,900
blow up Army B's train?

217
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,540
I think...

218
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,580
Stop thinking.

219
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,740
Old soldier,

220
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,340
if I didn't

221
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,340
blow up Army B's train,

222
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,820
Division 234's people

223
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,180
would have been blown up way before.

224
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,940
Also,

225
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,340
hadn't I fired that signal shell,

226
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,740
Division 234 would have been cleared at Zhangmu,

227
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,580
right?

228
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,900
I saved him twice,

229
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,460
and now he's firing me!

230
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,460
So you are feeling wronged?

231
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,140
Not wronged exactly,

232
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,860
just pity.

233
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,500
I think being a soldier is nice.

234
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,100
If I stay in the troop,

235
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,460
I can do a lot more great things.

236
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,620
I assume a dummy like you

237
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,980
must be raising pigs in the army.

238
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,020
It's fairly normal

239
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,340
that you don't understand what I said.

240
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,100
That's fine, just pack up and head back.

241
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,300
Don't keep talking with me.

242
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,420
I'm not going to suicide.

243
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,260
Don't worry,

244
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,780
Won't suicide?

245
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,580
Then why did you stayed in the water for hours.

246
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,860
I have no place to go.

247
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,300
You fool man,

248
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,100
can't you just go back home

249
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,660
and live an ordinary life?

250
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,260
Old soldier,

251
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,220
why did you join the army at first?

252
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,260
Me?

253
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,340
I have to think about that.

254
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,940
Don't talk about me, it's about you.

255
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,220
Me?

256
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,500
There's nothing to say about me.

257
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,700
I'm an orphan.

258
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,980
I didn't have a home at first,

259
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,620
then my brother took me home and brought me up.

260
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,740
[Thanks benefactor for raising this kid.]

261
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,820
My brother is awesome.

262
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,140
He's a war hero.

263
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,300
He died on the battle field.

264
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,340
Why are you like that?

265
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,420
Don't you believe me?

266
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,020
Come, come, come.

267
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,580
Back then,

268
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,940
they gave me this suvenir. Look,

269
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,260
to the most lovable person.

270
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,100
Wow,

271
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,320
you can read!

272
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,260
Your bond with your brother is tight.

273
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,940
I always miss my brother.

274
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,820
And when my brother was gone,

275
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,700
I became very afraid of being alone.

276
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,060
In the village,

277
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,260
I always asked other children to play with me.

278
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,460
Since then,

279
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,940
I started to be really afraid of the dusk.

280
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,420
Because after the sun set,

281
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,300
and the other kids went home,

282
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,900
I was all by myself.

283
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,620
Then I went working in a mine.

284
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,260
But I was in the mine all day,

285
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,820
and I couldn't see the sun year after year.

286
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,540
It’s so boring that I quitted.

287
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,940
I felt like I should

288
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,220
serve my country like my brother,

289
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,300
so I joined the army.

290
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,570
Do you know what about the army

291
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,340
attracts me most?

292
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,180
What?

293
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,940
The life there.

294
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,340
I finally found

295
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,060
that there's a place in the world,

296
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,820
where everyone eats together,

297
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,740
sleeps together and trains together.

298
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,420
We help each other, and are united.

299
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,140
From then on I wouldn't be alone.

300
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,420
I was determined

301
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:44,820
that I'll

302
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:45,780
work hard,

303
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:46,780
do my best in the army.

304
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,260
But they fired me.

305
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,780
And you feel wronged?

306
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,100
The worst you may face

307
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,460
is just be like the old days.

308
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,380
Old soldier, you don't know,

309
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,060
when a homeless man

310
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,020
finally knows what home is like,

311
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,580
even if it's not that great to him,

312
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,060
he won't want to go back to the old days.

313
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,700
I knew a guy in the army,

314
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,260
he liked bragging all day,

315
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,660
feeling like he was so great,

316
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,060
but he was actually a nerd.

317
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,420
Always talked about the planes,

318
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,450
tanks, and cannons.

319
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,500
The male leader praise him, and the female soldiers were attracted by him.

320
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,780
Actually,

321
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,140
that's a kind of addiction,

322
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:31,980
right?

323
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,940
There are all kinds of addictions.

324
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,100
Cigarettes, alcoho...

325
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,060
I'm different,

326
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,220
I'm addicted to crowds.

327
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,980
I just like how lively the military is.

328
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,300
Old man,

329
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,180
what are you addicted to?

330
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,060
Fishing?

331
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,580
I'm short-tempered.

332
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,180
I get high blood pressure easily.

333
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,460
The doctor told me to fish to treat my temper.

334
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,460
But hearing you,

335
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,660
I think you really got the point.

336
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,580
I'm addicted to being a bad-tempered man,

337
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,140
and fishing can't treat that.

338
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,580
New recruit,

339
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,340
you've been harping a lot,

340
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,420
now listen to me for a second.

341
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,700
Actually, I don't like fishing at all,

342
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,660
but I've been doing it for more than 20 years.

343
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,860
I rely on it to be patient.

344
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,700
People who wish to get satisfied have to pay the price.

345
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,060
If you think the military

346
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,900
is the most interesting place in the world,

347
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,180
then you'll stay here

348
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,100
and feel

349
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,860
the happiness and freedom you can't find elsewhere.

350
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,780
Then what price do I have to pay?

351
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:34,660
Get up.

352
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,300
Up.

353
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,740
Don't play mysterious, old fellow.

354
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,380
Tell me what it will cost me.

355
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,860
Will they dig out the guts or get my brain cooked?

356
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,620
Or cut off the limb?

357
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:50,860
Everything.

358
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,620
All the things you think of and don't think of.

359
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,780
Everything.

360
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,700
This is the most costly experience.

361
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,620
Strange old fellow.

362
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:10,940
[People's Liberation Army 53082 Force]

363
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,900
One, two, one.

364
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,940
One, two, three, four.

365
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,180
One, two, three, four.

366
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,260
Sergeant Zhang.

367
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:15,359
Hey, Shao,

368
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,700
is it your shift today?

369
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,200
Yes, Sir.

370
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,140
Sergeant.

371
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:23,849
What's wrong with your leg?

372
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,980
You little recruit,

373
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,829
don't you recognize this?

374
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,220
Neither thunder in the sky nor ghosts on earth

375
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,990
are as painful as rheumatism.

376
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,100
An old illness.

377
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,740
Shao, why did you speak of it?

378
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,220
Sergeant.

379
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,660
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

380
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,060
Here.

381
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:36,820
How about this?

382
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:38,900
Please sit here,

383
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,380
[People's Liberation Army 53082 Force]

384
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,100
and I’ll push you forward.

385
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,420
No, I'm fine.

386
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,060
I'm almost there.

387
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:47,820
Sergeant.

388
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,340
Report!

389
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,500
Come in.

390
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,260
Division commander.

391
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,820
Did you fire the flare?

392
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:07,820
Report!

393
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:08,940
No.

394
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,820
The one I hit was a stink bomb.

395
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,420
Then why don't you explain it?

396
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,420
I wrote it in the general report of the exercise.

397
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:16,900
Division commander,

398
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,020
I wrote it, too.

399
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,140
They might have overlooked.

400
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,310
What happened in the war

401
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,930
must be truthfully recorded.

402
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,040
You shouldn't take this reward.

403
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,700
Yes, Sir.

404
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,530
I will accept everything that is done to me.

405
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,660
Well,

406
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,500
the division owes you a promotion

407
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,580
from the last fighting competition.

408
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,300
Let me help you sort it out.

409
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,100
I'll compensate you with a promotion this time.

410
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,500
Thank you, division commander.

411
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,260
But,

412
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,540
I feel shame about it.

413
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,780
You shouldn’t show your shame to me.

414
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,340
You should say it

415
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,220
to the recruit who fired the flare.

416
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,220
Yes, Sir.

417
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,420
I'm on to him right away.

418
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,700
Not now.

419
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,260
He is still in

420
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,340
some kind of trouble now.

421
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,900
It will be too much for him

422
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,500
to let him know this.

423
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,540
Division commander,

424
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,260
maybe we can apply to superiors for a reward for him?

425
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,740
Bullshit.

426
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,460
What happened in the war

427
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,220
must be truthfully recorded.

428
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,140
He knew nothing

429
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:19,980
when he fired that flare.

430
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,180
What's fun?

431
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,100
Division commander,

432
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,020
you just told us to recorded truthfully,

433
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,820
but now you're talking about the opposite right now.

434
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,220
I'm confused.

435
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,140
People who haven't fought don't understand.

436
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,420
There are many heroes in war.

437
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,340
And there are many heroic behaviors too.

438
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,660
But very few people get a military merit badge.

439
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:39,940
The standard of reward

440
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,860
needs to be measured.

441
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,180
Yes, Sir, I will learn.

442
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,340
As to that recruit,

443
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,580
we will treat him fairly.

444
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,740
Attention!

445
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,740
Can't you hear the “Attention“?

446
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,780
Don't stand there.

447
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,860
Come and sit, bro.

448
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,580

451
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,140
instead of being withdrawn from the military, you two stay and

452
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,020
being informed and criticized.

454
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,780
Instructor, what is that means?

455
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,020
I haven't finished.

456
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,260
Gu Yiye is forced to stay.

457
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,300
Gao Liang,

458
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,180
should ask for his own wishes.

459
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,580
If he do not intend to continue to serve in the military,

460
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,460
He can withdraw from the army.

461
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,780

00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,420
Who wrote the note?

463
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,420
You shouldn't ask this.

Who has fire?

465
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,100
Who has fire? Fire?

466
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,540
No, no.

467
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,260
Let me do this.

00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,900

469
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,660

470
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,100

all of you,

Throw away the way you thought

before you joined the army.

481
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,260
Train well and obey the management.

482
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,420
Let the regiment 720  no longer be

483
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,340
left behind.

484
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,260
Go for it!

485
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,900
Understand?

486
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,020
Yes, Sir!

487
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,020
Great.

Here!

00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,340
Zhao Hongliu,

493
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,700
introduce yourself to everyone.

494
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,140
Reporting to everyone!

495
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,140
Oh, no, it's,

496
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,980
reporting to the instructor Lu and everyone!

497
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,220
My name is Zhao Hongliu.

498
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,780
But I'm not an Air Force family member,

499
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,460
my father was in the Army.

500
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,620
He wanted to be a bomber pilot,

501
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,660
but he didn't pass the exam,

502
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,860
so he wanted me to pass it.

503
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:58,540
I...

504
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,300
Turns out you failed, too.

505
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,300
Yes.

506
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,340
I didn't pass the pilot recruitment test.

507
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,020
So I chose here.

508
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,580
My father was in the

509
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,940
division 234 of the army A when he was alive.

510
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,780
Zhao Hongliu.

511
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,580
Lead the group properly.

512
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,900
Your father

513
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,300
will be proud of you.

00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,380
Great.

00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:44,940

00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,660
who is our

00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,660
new division commander?

521
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:50,820
Report!

522
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,020
Come in, Hanyong.

523
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,220

524
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,100
make him a glass of water.

525
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,580
Colonel.

526
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,020
Hanyong.

527
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,780
I've got a good news for you.

528
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,820
I've got your new job

529
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,100
arranged.

530
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,820
You're not asking me to lead new recruits, are you?

531
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,780
As a soldier from the Night tiger company of regiment 720,

532
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,820
you are smart.

533
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,580
Though the Night tiger company is famous,

534
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,860
but you are more than that.

535
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,420
So the group attaches great importance to you.

536
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,980
They see you as the best person to lead new recruits.

537
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,140
They want you to help the regement 720

538
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,740
from the very start, from the recruits.

539
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,820
To create new power.

540
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:33,780
How is that?

541
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,900
Can you feel the energy from it?

542
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:37,820
Colonel.

543
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,540
I am not exalting myself.

544
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,580
With my reputation and ability,

545
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,140
I'm better suited to lead a pacesetter company.

546
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,500
I was wasting my time with you.

547
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,340
Don't you understand?

548
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,660
The pacesetter company?

549
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,700
You wish.

550
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,220
The pacesetter company was already being brought.

551
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,300
Report!

552
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,300
Come in.

553
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,260
Why you are here?

554
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,380
Colonel.

555
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,620
I told him to come here.

556
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,540
Colonel.

557
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,860
I need to consider

558
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,260
the decisions from the regiment.

559
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,220
To be honest.

560
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,540
The assignment of me to the regiment 720

561
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,660
is already make me feel hard to accept.

562
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,020
I look down on your regiment.

563
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,780
Life is so short.

564
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,140
The military career was shorter.

565
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,340
I just want to show my talent

566
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,460
in the armed forces

567
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,100
in such short time.

568
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,860
Since now I don't have that chance anymore,

569
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,300
I can't achieve what I've been dreamt of.

570
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,940
Now I just got one thought.

571
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,180
Leave.

572
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,100
[Report of transferring to civilian work]

573
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,740
This is the transferred to civilian work report of mine.

574
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:47,660
Wait!

575
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,700
Lu Pingfan.

576
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,660
What do you mean?

577
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,900
Let us go straight

578
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,100
in front of the colonel.

579
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,820
We've selected the recruits

580
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,340
with highest quality

581
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,340
and made them a company.

582
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,300
The colonel chose you as their leader

583
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,820
he wants you to train them to be a pacesetter company.

584
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,980
What?

585
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,260
You feel not being treated right?

586
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,940
What's wrong with you?

587
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,340
Why are you so conceited?

588
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,900
Lu Pingfan.

589
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,660
I don't blame you for despising Regiment 720.

590
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,060
I will not force you to stay

591
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,740
using my power.

592
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,580
It's ok for you

593
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:51,780
to be conceit.

594
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,580
But I hope that you, being a student,

595
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,860
have the qualification to be conceited.

596
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,820
The training for new recruits is not a long time.

597
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,540
I believe that these several months for training

598
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,860
will not take up much of your time in your limited life.

599
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,620
If you are capable of

600
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,300
training this company

601
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,660
to a high level

602
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,140
that even division commander acclaim your work,

603
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,740
I will not hesitate to approve you transferring to civilian work.

604
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,380
Colonel,

605
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,300
I understand why the company transferred us

606
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,340
to the corps.

607
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,020
But to tell you the truth,

608
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,860
Regiment 720

609
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,220
leaving the valley

610
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,980
with one or two

611
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,100
model companies only

612
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,740
will not be enough.

613
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,220
If you can accept the challenge,

614
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,860
then don't negotiate with me.

615
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,620
Just obey orders.

616
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,580
- Colonel, the model soldier... - And you.

617
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,380
You can blame as well,

618
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,780
but that will be useless.

619
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,980
You have connections with the division commander,

620
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,420
thus you're his own clique.

621
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,900
You are even not qualified to negotiate with me.

622
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,140
It has been decided that

623
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,260
you are the commander of No.3 new recruit company.

624
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:08,900
Dismiss.

625
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,660
Don't expect me to treat you well.

626
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,060
You're not nowhere near

627
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,380
being a qualified sodier.

628
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,310
The star on your head

629
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,220
- Front dress. - and the badge around your neck

630
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,620
are given to you on credit.

631
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,220
Goose-stepping breaks up movement.

632
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,580
All of you!

633
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,180
One.

634
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,780
You will not be a real soldier

635
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,660
- to wear them - Turn around!

636
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,540
until you're qualified.

637
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,060
Before then,

638
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,140
I will not show you any mercy.

639
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,020
Be careful.

640
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,500
Squat half step forward!

641
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,500
A soldier should act like a soldier.

642
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,300
All of you, stand up straight!

643
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,340
Dress to the right!

644
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,420
26 minutes.

645
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,180
Were you all crawling here?

646
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,660
All of you, get up!

647
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:37,780
Keep running!

648
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,740
Those who can't finish within 22 minutes

649
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,580
can all piss off!

650
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,980
Our company will not tolerate with these trash!

651
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,620
Get up! Get up!

652
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,220
Keep running!

653
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,100
Run!

654
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,820
Run!

655
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,020
Hurry up! Hurry up!

656
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:09,220
[Reinforce combat readiness, ready to fight.]

657
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:04,250
- Practice swinging arms on the spot. - Forward march.

658
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,700
These female soldiers

659
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,860
are all directional soldiers of the division headquaters.

660
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,180
Originally,

661
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,740
they'll be trained by the divisional training unit.

662
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,060
But the site and barracks

663
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,700
were washed away by the flood.

664
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,180
Therefore Regiment 720 took up the place.

665
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,420
It's a test from the division headquarter to our Regiment 720

666
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,940
for training these female soldiers.

667
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,020
You have to be strict

668
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,100
and control the management ability.

669
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,260
Colonel, don't worry.

670
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,300
These female soldiers

671
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,220
are beside the vegetable garden.

672
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,980
The material warehouse has been vacated.

673
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:48,460
[Struck root in the camp.]

674
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,620
It's far away from where the male soldiers are.

675
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,820
It's a whole garden away,

676
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,100
and it's a separate yard.

677
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,580
But there's not canteen in the warehouse.

678
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,780
So they might be eat with

679
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,300
No.3 new recruit company.

680
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,740
What trouble will it take to set up a cooking bench?

681
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,860
Some veteran just left, didn't they?

682
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,860
Most companies have no cooks.

683
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,380
Nobody cooks for them.

684
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,700
Tell Qin Hanyong and Zhao Hongying.

685
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,460
Keep an eye on them.

686
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,860
Nothing can go wrong.

687
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,080
Yes, sir.

688
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:19,300
[Who knows the dishes food, each grain is hard.]

689
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,420
Sit down.

690
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,140
Let's eat.

691
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,820
Be careful! Don't touch me!

692
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,900
It hurts!

693
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,540
That hurts so much!

694
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,980
That hurts so much!

695
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,060
Don't complain. My leg was hurt as well.

696
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,860
Our company commander

697
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,380
may probably be just started.

698
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,820
I can't.

699
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,460
Today I'll go to the clinic

700
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,660
and ask them to give me a sick note. Whatever.

701
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,500
I will not go.

702
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,340
No. 3 company!

703
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,300
Stand up!

704
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,420
Listen to my order!

705
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,220
No. 3 company, all of you!

706
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,420
Lay low and crawl.

707
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,340
Target,

708
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:29,780
barrier site.

709
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,100
No. 9 squad in the lead.

710
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:34,580
Let's go!

711
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,340
Hurry!

712
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,180
Hurry!

713
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,660
Eat!

714
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,460
Don't look!

715
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,260
Hurry up!

716
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,740
Are you turtles?

717
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,940
Hurry up!

718
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,100
Even though Gao Lianggu is just nearby,

719
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,430
nobody dare to greet.

720
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,610
Strict diciplines and orders

721
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,590
are everwhere.

722
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,670
We need to get used to obey.

723
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,660
Personality, in this place,

724
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,100
is no more that tofu-shaped quilt.

725
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,220
It's unification that matters.

726
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,300
Be serious and lively.

727
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,660
Be tenacious.

728
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,220
Comrade,

729
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,420
we met among crowed people.

730
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,020
You want more punishment, right?

731
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:38,340
One, two, three, four!

732
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:41,140
[Never shed tears even for bloody sweat. Never be left behind even being peeled of the meat.]

733
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,060
One, two, three, four!

734
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,300
Did you not learn the rules of internal affairs?

735
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,500
Lights-out has not been blown.

736
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:47,900
All lying in bed.

737
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:48,940
It hurts.

738
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,540
My leg.

739
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,980
Where's Niu Mancang?

740
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,940
Being punished by the company commander

741
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:56,860
for being in the last place in the traning this afternoon.

742
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,900
Applying fertilizer in the garden.

743
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,640
And he said that

744
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,100
as long as you're the last place

745
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,300
in the training,

746
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,620
applying fertilizer will be the punishment.

747
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,820
This is so-called working hard and aiming high.

748
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,460
You have more information

749
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:09,860
than me being a squad leader.

750
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,699
Because I was the last but one this afternoon.

751
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,580
I would be the last

752
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,020
if not pushing hard

753
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:16,980
in the end of the training.

754
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,300
Okay, stop chatting.

755
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,580
Go wash up.

756
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,780
Working hard and aiming high.

757
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,300
Only working fertilizer,

758
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,460
and no aiming at all.

759
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,060
What do you want this time?

760
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,780
No, Qin Dapao

761
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,139
was just being sarcasm.

762
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:33,420
I'm telling you,

763
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,659
if Qin Dapao

764
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,820
bully me,

765
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,780
I'll fertilize the wall

766
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,780
in the company well.

767
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,100
Come on!

768
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,260
You want to be dropped out again, don't you?

769
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,460
No, Gu Yiye,

770
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,820
don't you know a lot of information?

771
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,420
You tell me,

772
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:48,100
are there any new recruits

773
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,659
being trained to death like this?

774
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:51,900
Is he reaonable? Isn't he insane?

775
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,860
He's insane.

776
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,100
The training of new recruits

777
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,460
should focus on being familiar with the environment

778
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,820
and shaping personalities,

779
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,780
instead of training them to death

780
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,140
which will injure them

781
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,700
and enhance negative mentality.

782
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,540
As for the reasons of training like this,

783
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,820
I think there are two possibilities.

784
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,620
First of all,

785
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,900
the colonel wants to have achievements.

786
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,340

787
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,460
That's why.

788
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,380
I'm telling you

789
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,260
that Qin Dapao wants to train the poor soldiers into good ones.

790
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,580
Seconly,

791
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,380
there's not enough time.

792
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,260
What's not enough time?

793
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:29,740

why Zhao Hongliu and Niu Mancang are not here.

Gao.

905
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,940
Sir Jiang Nanzheng,

906
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,100
falling in love with someone who doesn't love you back

907
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,740
is hard

908
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,260
and has no future.

909
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,380
If you cannot stop it,

910
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,540
just keep it to yourself.

911
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,540
In the end,

912
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,900
it'll work out.

913
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,660
- You wait and see, Gao Liang. - Girls.

Get down!

918
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,180
Or I'll report to your company commander.

919
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,180
This is too high.

920
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,820
For the first task of today's squad meeting,

921
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,220
I'll announce a good news.

922
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,020
Our squad wans ranked

923
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,540
as the model squad in our platoon.

924
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:39,620
Report!

925
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,500
Speak!

926
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,260
Squad leader,

927
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,020
how come we can be model squad?

928
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:44,900
Model squad

929
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,460
means that each one of you

930
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,880
can be the model of our platoon.

931
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,100
This honor

932
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,660
means that we have made

933
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,580
much more effort than others.

934
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,740
Being a model squad

935
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,500
means that we need to be strick with ourselves.

936
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,580
In the mix-training between male and female soldiers,

937
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,500
the most important thing is

938
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,500
the relationship between male and female soldiers

939
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,340
which will influence our work and training.

940
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,100
Therefore,

941
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,300
what happens today,

942
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,660
strickly speaking,

943
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,300
is not permitted whatsoever.

944
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,500
Here,

945
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,700
I'll announce a rule.

946
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,100
During the training of new recruits,

947
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,180
the female soldiers and male soldiers

948
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,900
must not contact with each other except for work.

949
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,500
Remember,

950
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,380
in the troops,

951
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,580
discipline is an iron.

952
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,020
Those who violate it will bleed.

953
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:24,980
Understand?

954
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,020
Understand.

955
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,540
Jiang Nanzheng.

956
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,060
Understand.

957
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,820
The yelling of Gao Liang on the wall

958
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,180
enlightened me.

959
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,900
The exciting moments with Gu Yiye

960
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,340
such as relaying secret messages,

961
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,780
saving Division 234,

962
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,420
and the worry and concerned

963
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,500
upon hearing him being dropped out,

964
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,180
were like

965
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,820
the start of a dream.

966
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,540
I can smell the taste of freedom when wind blows by the weeds.
