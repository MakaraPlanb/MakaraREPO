1
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:41,199
did you hear the sound

2
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:46,040
In front is the sleepy Longyuan

3
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,959
We have to quickly unlock the seal of the Dragon God

4
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,800
Otherwise, wait for Cangliu to come.

5
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,959
it's hard to deal with

6
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:52,319
good

7
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,279
go

8
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,400
didn't care at the time

9
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,879
I thought we were going to catch

10
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,080
must be a man with a weapon

11
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,519
They don't have swords

12
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:00,559
Just let them into town

13
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,639
Major General please forgive me

14
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:06,639
still a step too late

15
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,119
soldier on duty

16
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,759
negligent military law
Watching at kisskh.me

17
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:16,759
Major General is not dereliction of duty

18
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,160
The subordinate found the two of them

19
00:02:18,279 --> 00:02:19,440
It's the two people on the arrest warrant.

20
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,160
take away the subordinates

21
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,679
Major General Major General

22
00:02:22,839 --> 00:02:23,600
Major General

23
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:25,520
Is this punishment too severe?

24
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,039
They let no one else

25
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,720
but the sea emperor

26
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,199
Bai Ying and Su G have already arrived here first

27
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,600
They will definitely go directly to trapped Longyuan.

28
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:35,279
So what do we do next

29
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:37,639
You lead your troops to the Sleepy Dragon Abyss immediately

30
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,479
Remember

31
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,279
take a mountain road away from the river

32
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,199
Do not touch any water source

33
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,160
Why

34
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:45,279
I have reason

35
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,119
how about you

36
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,360
then come

37
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,919
Major General

38
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:04,800
Everyone obeys

39
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,240
Immediately follow me to the trapped Longyuan to capture the Emperor of the Sea

40
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,240
Yes
Watching at kisskh.me

41
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:20,240
Why is the Major General staying here?

42
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:22,800
you stand here

43
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,600
don't have to come

44
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,559
This is the Sleepy Dragon

45
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,000
Back then, King Xingzun captured the Dragon God

46
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:03,240
cut a line in the ground

47
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:05,199
Lock the Dragon God here

48
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:14,039
I feel a surge of anger
Watching at kisskh.me

49
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:16,519
the power of despair

50
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,760
for thousands of years

51
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,880
No one can cross the barrier of trapped Longyuan

52
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:52,160
I go down first

53
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,440
you are waiting for me here

54
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,720
no good

55
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,519
It was poisoned in the river

56
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,079
Su G lets you swim as fast as you can

57
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,640
Faster than this water

58
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:27,359
This poison is so fast

59
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,239
This poison is so ferocious

60
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,799
But you should be fine if you take the meds.

61
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,359
What's the matter with you, Major

62
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,839
Yunhuang strange poison ghost red Yan

63
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,920
you just got poisoned

64
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:46,640
I have an antidote

65
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,920
Didn't I tell you not to come out alone?

66
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,279
Why do you act on your own?

67
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,399
The subordinates are worried about the Major General

68
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:05,399
let's go

69
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,160
Yes

70
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:11,839
The suicide by drowning

71
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,079
There are ghost red yams in the water

72
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,959
I'm going to have a look

73
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,040
no need

74
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:25,239
You will die immediately if you touch this water

75
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,720
go

76
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,599
Bai Ying

77
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,559
just came down

78
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:01,880
Those fogs make me hallucinate

79
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,320
Don't worry I'm here

80
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,919
strangeness

81
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:19,719
Why can't I find where the sleepy dragon cable is?

82
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,679
Let's split up

83
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,520
Bai Ying

84
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:27,599
Remember

85
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,640
We have reached the boundary of Fuyu County

86
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,039
The front is heavily guarded

87
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,039
Let's go by water

88
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,159
Should we wait any longer for the left to make them

89
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,280
Rest for a while

90
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,960
If Yanxi didn't come

91
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,960
we won't wait

92
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,039
Blame that Zhongzhou girl

93
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,840
Not accustomed to water, but still dragging the left power

94
00:10:16,479 --> 00:10:17,719
Otherwise how fast can we go by water?

95
00:10:17,719 --> 00:10:18,400
talkative

96
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,679
Can't wait to get into the water

97
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,080
Anyway, Yanxi knows the way

98
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,559
rightist

99
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:31,119
There are cracks on the sound beads from Xiao

100
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:33,039
I don't know if there is any sound

101
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,400
never

102
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:47,479
never

103
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:51,039
It's Xiao's voice

104
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,960
It's a pity that I can only hear the word "don't"

105
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,679
Mo Feixiao was discovered when he was in the sound transmission beads

106
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,719
damaged sound beads

107
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,039
there is a possibility

108
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,039
Are you going to remind us

109
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,239
Do not go trapped in Longyuan

110
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:08,200
Isn't that young master dangerous?

111
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:11,080
Then we go by water

112
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:12,280
go

113
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,520
Yanxi we are all the way

114
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,119
Walk along the mark left by Ning Liang

115
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,359
Why haven't you met them yet?

116
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,760
will they be okay?

117
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:23,799
Will not

118
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,239
Let's hurry up

119
00:11:25,239 --> 00:11:25,960
good

120
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:29,919
how's it going

121
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,559
better

122
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:31,400
Ning Liang

123
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,520
Yanxi

124
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,479
Ning Liang

125
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,440
what happened

126
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,880
we are poisoned

127
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,840
Cang Liu set a level here

128
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,960
forcing us into the water

129
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,239
Toxic in water

130
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,479
what poison is this?

131
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:46,799
It's too cruel

132
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,479
This should be the ghost red yan

133
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,000
Ghost Red Yan

134
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,799
What happens after being poisoned

135
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,239
The poison is in the water

136
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:56,159
As long as a person enters the water and touches the poison line

137
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:58,719
Immediately, the entire body will be petrified to death in pain.

138
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,440
Now it seems

139
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,719
The water in the entire Suiyu County is filled with this poison.

140
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,320
Cangliu people are too cruel

141
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,960
Is there a cure for this poison?

142
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,719
There must be an antidote for those who are poisoned

143
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:11,880
then let's go

144
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:15,359
What's wrong

145
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:19,320
We have spies in Cangliu Barracks

146
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,479
Why am I not getting any messages

147
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:22,719
I received Xiao's tone beads

148
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,239
But the bead is broken

149
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,840
Okay, I'll definitely get the antidote back.

150
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,239
go

151
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:34,440
Be careful

152
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,080
sit here

153
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:35,760
give

154
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,520
Why doesn't this fog go away?

155
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:19,119
Neptune

156
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:21,159
help us help

157
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:24,679
save us save us

158
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,559
save our sea emperor

159
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,119
sea ​​emperor sea emperor

160
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:34,919
Neptune

161
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,039
King Kongsang has already killed the blue seaside

162
00:13:37,479 --> 00:13:38,119
He said

163
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:40,320
He said that Princess Yaran poisoned Queen Baiwei

164
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:42,679
Said to step on Hiraizumi to avenge the queen first

165
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,760
If you want to fight

166
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,520
How can you send troops without a name

167
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,200
Are those just now illusions again?

168
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,280
why so real

169
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,559
Su G

170
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:34,320
Su G

171
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,960
Su G is that you?

172
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:08,880
Su G

173
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,039
Su G, have you found the sleepy Long Suo?

174
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,719
The fog here is really weird

175
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:18,799
Find the sleepy dragon first.

176
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,159
Su G

177
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:32,799
Did I just tap the light-shielding beads twice?

178
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:33,679
you feel me

179
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:34,960
So I found it

180
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,880
yeah let's go

181
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:42,320
You are not Su G

182
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,599
Who are you

183
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:44,880
why are you pretending to be him

184
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:48,559
I am Su G

185
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,960
Without the blessing of the Dragon God

186
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:22,559
From now on, Izumi will obey from generation to generation

187
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,640
You killed Quan Xian today

188
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:31,000
another day

189
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,200
Kongsang must be destroyed by others

190
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:39,119
When will this back and forth stop

191
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,280
what are you doing

192
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,760
You are no longer the Ah Lang I know

193
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:52,039
I grew up with my childhood sweetheart

194
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:53,640
The good astronomer Ah Lang

195
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,119
but became the King of Stars that I no longer know

196
00:16:58,719 --> 00:16:59,880
The back soil ring

197
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:01,520
i give you back

198
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:08,040
Queen of Houtu ring

199
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,479
How can this day and earth be ours?

200
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,000
The Seven Seas are where the ancestors of Izumi lived.

201
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,719
Yunhuang is the home of all living beings

202
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:48,239
how can it be your everything

203
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:50,959
You don't get obsessed anymore

204
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,880
let it go

205
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:30,920
who are you

206
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,520
i am you

207
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,280
Are you an illusion or what?

208
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,800
I am not an illusion

209
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,359
I'm the one who came to end you

210
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:45,959
Today I will take back everything that belongs to me

211
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,400
Su G

212
00:19:52,439 --> 00:19:53,079
Bai Ying

213
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:55,199
Bai Ying

214
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:38,839
Who would that person be?

215
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,199
It turns out to be an illusion

216
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:44,560
Seems to be waiting for us here on purpose

217
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,400
Could it be someone sent by the prey?

218
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:48,719
Not sure yet

219
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:51,520
Anyway, this place is weird

220
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:54,079
There will always be delusional illusions

221
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,199
Just now I too was caught up in the illusion of the past

222
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,520
Phantom of the Past

223
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,680
I saw seven thousand years ago

224
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:04,560
King Xingzun and Queen Baiwei are trapped in Longyuan here

225
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,479
I also saw Queen Baiwei

226
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:08,199
how to die

227
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,920
What kind of past in that fantasy

228
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,359
Queen Baiwei she

229
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,719
she was killed

230
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:21,959
But I haven't seen the result yet

231
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,199
Maybe it's an illusion

232
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,319
You said you saw Queen Baiwei

233
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,680
Does Queen Baiwei look like me?

234
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,599
picture

235
00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:35,239
No wonder when I was in the Mirror Tower

236
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,359
Prey, he will call me Avi

237
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,800
Not only that

238
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:40,920
True Lan and King Xingzun

239
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,839
I look exactly the same as Chunhuang

240
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,119
It seems that this trapped Longyuan not only seals the Dragon God

241
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:48,479
It also hides the secrets from 7,000 years ago

242
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:52,280
Then you say we look so much like them

243
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,839
between us and them

244
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,000
Is there some mysterious connection?

245
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:56,880
Bai Ying

246
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,640
you are you

247
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,439
Even if two people look alike

248
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:02,400
two completely different people

249
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:04,160
have a different destiny

250
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,599
before knowing the truth

251
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:07,719
Don't be fooled by the stuff here

252
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,640
what happened to you

253
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,959
Bai Ying is not safe here

254
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,160
If she really has anything to do with Bai Wei

255
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,319
let's go

256
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,359
Although you and I are superiors

257
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,359
But don't be so rigid

258
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:56,760
The poison of red yan is your masterpiece

259
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,160
nothing to do with her

260
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,880
she's with you all day

261
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,439
I didn't get a chance to talk to her

262
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,719
you go out

263
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,199
Yes

264
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,040
Who told you that

265
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,680
There are many people who saw the corpse of the merman by the river

266
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,199
petrified

267
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,920
That's what the merman in the camp said

268
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,400
Feather magic

269
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,400
young

270
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,439
I'm just living in Fuchu all day

271
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:40,959
A young master who bullied the maid

272
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,839
a playboy

273
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,800
It's you who taught me hard and woke me up

274
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,119
I just followed you into the Wakamatsu Hall

275
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,400
to become a warrior

276
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,280
say the point

277
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,520
The point is

278
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,599
You most disdain this small trick of poisoning

279
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,560
why are you now

280
00:23:57,199 --> 00:23:59,079
No longer like the Yuhuan I used to admire

281
00:24:00,479 --> 00:24:01,439
just be yourself

282
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:03,359
don't admire me

283
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:04,760
I haven't changed

284
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:06,040
you've changed

285
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,280
did you

286
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,959
When I saw Nan Zhao tortured and killed the merman

287
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,880
you'll help like me

288
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,000
You know the poison of red yan

289
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:15,640
How many innocent people will be killed?

290
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,520
innocent

291
00:24:21,239 --> 00:24:22,040
Fei Lian

292
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,839
those people

293
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,239
is our enemy

294
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,560
That Su G has already got the Heaven-defying Sword

295
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:32,000
how

296
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,400
Are you waiting for him to summon the Dragon God?

297
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:40,439
Either you have to strategize with me

298
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:42,040
if you don't want to

299
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,040
Camp bar

300
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:50,319
I'm off to camp

301
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,079
Why are there so many guards?

302
00:25:13,199 --> 00:25:14,640
How are we going to get in in a while?

303
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,800
I'll draw your attention

304
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:20,079
you hide in

305
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:27,199
It's you, you're Ting's sister

306
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,040
you're all right

307
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,000
Yuhuan fell into the water, the ghost red Yan

308
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:32,640
I have news for you

309
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,079
Why are you still in the water

310
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,880
Ning Liang received the sound beads

311
00:25:37,239 --> 00:25:38,400
But the sound beads are broken

312
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,280
We did not receive the complete message

313
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,239
No wonder

314
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I was planning to entangle Fei Lian while he was drunk.

315
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,119
message again

316
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,199
where is the antidote

317
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:47,959
in the phantom

318
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,599
Feather magic

319
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:51,680
Wouldn't it be more difficult

320
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,560
I have a way

321
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,280
But I need you to cooperate with me

322
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,520
any solution

323
00:25:58,719 --> 00:26:00,239
Somebody caught a spy

324
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,760
how is he

325
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,040
Fly fast and come closer

326
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:07,079
I'm afraid you won't be able to run away

327
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:18,439
Xiao

328
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,280
Xiao

329
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,800
How about it

330
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:30,359
I still pushed Xiao into the water.

331
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,280
She must have been poisoned by the ghost red Yan

332
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,680
Yuhuan is not easy to lie

333
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,479
If you don't do it real

334
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,000
If there are other witnesses

335
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,560
Yuhuan won't believe it anymore

336
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,400
But this time there is real evidence

337
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,959
Fei Lian seems to have seen me

338
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:44,199
Fei Lian

339
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:46,239
Are you sure he sees you

340
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:47,319
have no idea

341
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,040
But I see him

342
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,000
Will he think

343
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,199
Xiao is with us

344
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:52,239
Acting cheat antidote

345
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,359
It's over, it's over, it's over

346
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:55,920
Xiao is also hurt in vain

347
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,520
don't worry

348
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,199
Even if Fei Lian really sees you

349
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,920
He might not even be able to think of that.

350
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,359
What's more, in the eyes of Cang Liu

351
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,640
Xiao is Quanxian's traitor

352
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:06,119
It makes sense for you to hurt her

353
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,959
Now we can only wait and see what happens

354
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,319
wait patiently

355
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Yu Huan, if you have an antidote, give it to Xiao quickly.

356
00:27:40,479 --> 00:27:41,599
What exactly is going on

357
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:43,560
i caught a spy

358
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,719
I wanted to send her to the camp

359
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:50,000
I didn't want to be pushed into the river by her.

360
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,319
let her escape

361
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,359
See who the spy is?

362
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,199
I haven't had time to look closely

363
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,280
she struggled

364
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:02,359
what about you?

365
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,160
I only vaguely see a woman

366
00:28:04,959 --> 00:28:06,760
It must be the merman who came to explore the way.

367
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,520
shark

368
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:11,920
a shark

369
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,560
How can I run away under your nose?

370
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,479
The shark ran very fast

371
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,680
And Xiao fell into the water

372
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:18,839
i have to save her

373
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:22,920
except me

374
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,760
And many soldiers saw Xiao being pushed into the river

375
00:28:26,479 --> 00:28:27,199
come

376
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,280
exist

377
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,079
any of you have seen

378
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,199
Xiao was pushed into the water by the spies

379
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,319
Return to the Major General

380
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:37,599
I saw with my own eyes

381
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,959
Xiao caught a spy

382
00:28:39,479 --> 00:28:40,959
The spy pushed Xiao into the water

383
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,199
suddenly disappeared

384
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,800
The rest of the patrol team saw it too.

385
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,599
be able to prove

386
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:48,280
What does disappearing mean

387
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:50,239
That spy knows a little magic

388
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,800
So Xiaocai has no enemy

389
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,640
being pushed into the water

390
00:28:58,599 --> 00:28:59,160
go down

391
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,280
Yes

392
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,160
don't you believe me

393
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:04,800
you have always been sympathetic to the enemy

394
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,319
You mean I colluded with Xiao

395
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:09,040
Is it the antidote to deceive the ghost red Yan?

396
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:09,920
even so

397
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,280
I can't hurt Xiao like this.

398
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:14,560
Major General is incompetent

399
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:16,920
Major generals don't have to waste antidote for their subordinates

400
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,439
Xiao is willing to accept

401
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:20,400
Xiao is your subordinate

402
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:21,520
Born to die with you

403
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:23,439
you can really watch

404
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,680
Was she tortured to death by the poison of the ghost red Yan?

405
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:28,520
life and death

406
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,040
Major General Fei Lian thank you

407
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:36,680
But you don't have to plead for me

408
00:29:59,479 --> 00:30:00,160
give

409
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,920
Xiaofeilian said that I have changed

410
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:28,880
become stone-hearted

411
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:31,560
Is that right

412
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:36,959
Major General has not changed

413
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,239
But maybe you've changed

414
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:44,479
Xiao has not changed

415
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,680
I hope so

416
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:21,839
Come out

417
00:31:30,439 --> 00:31:31,040
go

418
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,560
Are you here to find the antidote?

419
00:31:44,199 --> 00:31:45,040
how do you know

420
00:31:45,199 --> 00:31:45,920
I'm not stupid

421
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,280
I can see your face

422
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,800
Xiao insisted that no

423
00:31:49,479 --> 00:31:50,479
So you are a gang

424
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,319
Xiao?

425
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:53,760
she's badly hurt

426
00:31:54,199 --> 00:31:55,199
But have taken the antidote

427
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:56,640
It should be fine

428
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,160
You better go now

429
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,880
It will be troublesome if someone comes later

430
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:00,959
What about you

431
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,439
Yu Huan found that the medicine was running out

432
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:03,479
will definitely investigate

433
00:32:03,719 --> 00:32:04,959
I am the Major General of Cangliu

434
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:07,239
And the love that grew up with him

435
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,119
He probably won't start with his friends, will he?

436
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,239
That

437
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,599
Xiao?

438
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,839
Don't worry I will protect her

439
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,479
thank you

440
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,880
You leave here with me

441
00:32:26,199 --> 00:32:27,400
you can stealth

442
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,520
Fei Lian can't stand it

443
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,119
go fast

444
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:36,119
Don't come, come again and I'll kill him

445
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,880
Put down the weapons

446
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,439
Fei Lian

447
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,959
You say I have changed

448
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,040
Actually you have changed

449
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:55,839
Yanxi Run

450
00:32:58,439 --> 00:32:59,040
Feather magic

451
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,239
long time no see you

452
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:01,599
Have a good fight

453
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:03,959
who wants to fight with you

454
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,839
This is the sleepy dragon platform, right?

455
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,000
should be

456
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,719
your back

457
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,040
This is the mark of the Dragon God

458
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:40,599
Dragon God should be nearby

459
00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:41,800
i can feel it

460
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,199
what happened to you

461
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,080
I feel

462
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,919
I feel like there's a pair of eyes watching us

463
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:37,959
Eye

464
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,360
She seems to have a lot to say to me

465
00:34:42,959 --> 00:34:44,360
I can feel her presence

466
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,439
who is she

467
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,280
have no idea

468
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,120
no matter what happens

469
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,959
you have to tell me in time

470
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,360
why can't i speak

471
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:35,760
Body can't move

472
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,600
Why can't my hand

473
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,000
you finally woke up

474
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,439
Why is Su G so strange?

475
00:35:46,959 --> 00:35:48,239
It's like you don't know me

476
00:35:50,479 --> 00:35:51,040
No

477
00:35:51,919 --> 00:35:54,040
This person is not Su G

478
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,919
you do not need to worry

479
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,760
you're just frightened

480
00:36:03,479 --> 00:36:04,800
not seriously injured

481
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,280
where is this

482
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,320
This is the Longxiao Palace

483
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:14,199
where is my boat

484
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,439
And the people on the boat?

485
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,000
Your ship should have sunk to the bottom of the ocean

486
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,520
i only see you

487
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:24,560
didn't see anyone else

488
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,840
you have a good rest

489
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,239
I'll see you later

490
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:33,840
don't think about it

491
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,239
correct

492
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,280
thank you

493
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,239
What's your name

494
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:42,800
pure brilliance

495
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:44,520
I am Bai Wei

496
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,159
Su G

497
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:03,840
Did it just

498
00:37:04,399 --> 00:37:06,399
It's the 7,000-year-old illusion you're talking about

499
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,280
you also saw

500
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,919
I seem to have gone back to seven thousand years ago

501
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:14,959
I can't speak

502
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,879
There's no way to move

503
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,919
It seems that I am Queen Baiwei

504
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,760
Me too

505
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,320
This phantom is really weird

506
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,080
What did you see in the vision

507
00:37:28,919 --> 00:37:30,239
should be pure huang

508
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,080
When I first met Queen Baiwei

509
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:33,840
in Longxiao Palace

510
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:34,800
right

511
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,600
We should have fallen into the same illusion at the same time

512
00:37:49,879 --> 00:37:51,719
To kill, to kill

513
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:54,600
neither kill you nor cut

514
00:37:57,919 --> 00:37:59,479
Put Fei Lian in my tent

515
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,280
Don't let him out without my permission

516
00:38:16,439 --> 00:38:17,239
Major General

517
00:38:18,399 --> 00:38:19,919
You know how to call me Major General

518
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,959
Today's business is yours

519
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,120
don't say yes?

520
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,320
ok let me speak for you

521
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,840
You take advantage of my last hope for you

522
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,479
Don't hesitate to jump into the poisonous river

523
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:44,000
Let's work together with Fei Lian

524
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,919
The antidote for deceived my ghost red yan

525
00:38:45,959 --> 00:38:46,879
finally gave him

526
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:48,840
right

527
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,719
I gave you one last chance

528
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:55,760
Let you choose between me and Su G

529
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,399
this is your answer

530
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,479
Fei Lian and Feather Magic

531
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:05,360
Maybe there is a heart of loyalty and retribution

532
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,479
Maybe I can help you

533
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:09,639
But in the end they are for

534
00:39:10,879 --> 00:39:12,399
I'm just making the best use of you

535
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,239
Who would you choose between us?

536
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,360
say

537
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:22,840
Say

538
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:26,479
Master Su G

539
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:29,800
Xiao

540
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,520
Xiao

541
00:39:33,879 --> 00:39:34,959
I didn't think about it

542
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,840
The sharpest weapon around me can hurt me

543
00:39:41,399 --> 00:39:42,800
But I still leave you

544
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:45,959
now

545
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:50,000
you're useless to me

546
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:00,840
Xiao

547
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:03,800
Xiao

548
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,280
Xiao

549
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,320
I will let your leftist

550
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,560
take your place

551
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,600
throw her in the river

552
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:47,320
Ning Liang

553
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,479
Nasheng

554
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,320
Have you got the antidote, Yanxi?

555
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:56,600
Yan Xi Yan Xi

556
00:40:57,439 --> 00:40:59,560
Yanxi and I sneaked to the camp

557
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:01,120
Xiao help us get the antidote

558
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,320
However, in order to draw away the officers and soldiers, Yan Xi

559
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,919
He was captured by Yu Huan

560
00:41:05,919 --> 00:41:07,000
Yan Xi was captured

561
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,600
He said he said let me come back first

562
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,520
Said that the poison of ghost red Yan can't wait

563
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,159
This is the antidote

564
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,719
There aren't many in there

565
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,879
Put these medicines in the water

566
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:23,080
drink for the soldiers

567
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:23,639
Yes

568
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:28,239
we are late

569
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,639
Don't blame yourself, you've done your best

570
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:33,959
Yanxi

571
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:37,479
Yanxi is afraid that the bad luck will be less.

572
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,159
Everyone has his mission

573
00:41:39,879 --> 00:41:41,280
We also have our own mission

574
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,719
Ning Liang, you are right

575
00:41:44,879 --> 00:41:46,120
No time to be sad now

576
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,639
I want to use the power of this emperor

577
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,199
I want to save the dragon god

578
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,479
After Su G released the Dragon God

579
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:52,760
Yanxi will be saved

580
00:41:53,399 --> 00:41:54,000
Nasheng

581
00:41:54,399 --> 00:41:55,639
There are people all over the place

582
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,760
you are going to die

583
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,000
Ning Liang, just let me go

584
00:41:59,959 --> 00:42:02,679
Yanxi Yanxi said this is his wish

585
00:42:02,919 --> 00:42:04,320
Even if he doesn't come back

586
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,040
I want to help him make this wish come true

587
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,919
if you must go

588
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,919
I'll send a few people to escort you

589
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,439
Thank you, Ning Liang

590
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,199
It's quiet here

591
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,879
Makes you feel a little weird

592
00:42:33,479 --> 00:42:35,520
I can't seem to feel the presence of any living thing

593
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:40,560
i can feel

594
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,919
There is a strong mind

595
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,800
We should be stuck here

596
00:42:50,479 --> 00:42:51,719
Those eyes appeared again
