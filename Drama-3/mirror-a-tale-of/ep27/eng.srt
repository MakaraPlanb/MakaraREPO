1
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,040
The emperor seems to be feeling

2
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:43,519
should be in there

3
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,239
I found it

4
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,279
Why can't this door be opened

5
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:06,199
is it a trap?

6
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,199
It's not like a trap

7
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,240
why is this

8
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,320
I do not know either

9
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:14,759
It should be blocked in there

10
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,720
I come

11
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,199
Your Highness, let me come

12
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,119
It's really weird

13
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:22,479
how did you come

14
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,839
Xijing starts from Jiuyi Mountain

15
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,320
You stand in front of me everywhere

16
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,039
look at you

17
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,080
Ready to die anytime

18
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,839
If you do this again

19
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,639
I'm so pissed

20
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,800
I do not want

21
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:42,199
I don't want to see anyone leave

22
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:44,639
Your Highness

23
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:45,679
All right

24
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,839
I'll come

25
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,479
anyway

26
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:54,520
There are also my ancestors lying here

27
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,759
There is no reason to bless the children and grandchildren.

28
00:03:02,119 --> 00:03:02,720
Nasheng

29
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,039
come over

30
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,520
i'm still angry

31
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,479
Nasheng

32
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,440
All right

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,679
Nasheng

34
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,960
I just couldn't control my emotions

35
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,199
sorry

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,880
I know

37
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,960
Prince brother

38
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,440
Thousands of children are important to you

39
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,720
but in my heart

40
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:38,000
I only have sister Bai Ying in my heart

41
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,000
so

42
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,399
we have to hurry up

43
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,919
Maybe there's still a chance to save them

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,399
You only have one sister Bai Ying

45
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,720
And me

46
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:51,880
She is the only white king

47
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:55,240
I won't watch her die

48
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,360
so

49
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,320
so i know

50
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,240
Don't make a fuss at this time

51
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,720
good Nasheng

52
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,479
you let go

53
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,279
everyone remembered

54
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,880
There are many organs in this mausoleum

55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,920
be careful

56
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,959
Is there water on this?

57
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:52,559
here under weak water

58
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:54,359
It must be weak water.

59
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,279
Then why doesn't the water flow down?

60
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,679
upper bound

61
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,440
Otherwise, the mausoleum will not be built under weak water.

62
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:07,880
from beads

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,519
Prince

64
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,920
follow carefully

65
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,600
Yes

66
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:18,480
what happened to the bead

67
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:19,600
leave her alone

68
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,040
Find the seal

69
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,880
Nasheng

70
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,200
Nasheng

71
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,440
Nasheng

72
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:53,519
Prince brother

73
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:09,279
Nasheng

74
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Nasheng Nasheng

75
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,359
Nasheng

76
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,880
The mountains and rivers are forever silent

77
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,760
This is the calligraphy of the King of Stars, right?

78
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,640
Nasheng

79
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,079
Nasheng

80
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,279
here in Xijing

81
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,679
Nasheng

82
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,399
Nasheng Nasheng

83
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:54,000
just passed out

84
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,160
Nasheng

85
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,880
wake up

86
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,519
Nasheng

87
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,320
wake up Nasheng

88
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:57,959
Nasheng

89
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,640
let go of me let go of my sheng

90
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,279
Nasheng

91
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:01,799
It's us

92
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,399
The prince's brother just had someone

93
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:08,000
Someone kidnapped me

94
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,559
He's going to steal my ring

95
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,279
ok it's alright

96
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,480
Why do you want to steal your ring

97
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,920
I don't know

98
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:18,519
He just dragged my hand

99
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,239
Then I fainted

100
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,040
stand up

101
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,200
Where is this

102
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:28,160
King Star's Mausoleum

103
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,760
what is this

104
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:35,519
Star King's Coffin

105
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,160
yes yes yes

106
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
right here right here

107
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,440
He just dragged me here

108
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:51,000
And the closer to the emperor, the brighter

109
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Why doesn't the emperor light up?

110
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,440
what's the situation

111
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:10,760
Nasheng, come here

112
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,279
hand

113
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,799
His Royal Highness Nasheng

114
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,399
Be careful

115
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:01,320
This coffin has been moved

116
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,400
Someone opened it first

117
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,359
The Mausoleum of the King of Stars

118
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,640
How could anyone move this coffin

119
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:11,520
open to take a look

120
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:14,960
Nasheng Nasheng

121
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,679
Your Highness, what did you see?

122
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,640
my descendants

123
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,640
when you open the coffin

124
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:12,760
life and death overlap

125
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,919
Start and end overlap

126
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:19,280
everything comes round

127
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,000
like mirror reflection

128
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,640
Your Highness, how are you?

129
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,280
what memory is this

130
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:42,119
Why is the King of Stars my face?

131
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:46,440
Queen Baiwei and Aying are exactly the same

132
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:48,159
Did someone kill Bai Wei?

133
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:52,919
Your Highness

134
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:54,919
what did you see

135
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,479
wife brother

136
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,760
don't scare me, what's wrong with you

137
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,000
I just saw the King of Stars

138
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,359
how so

139
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,880
There is no hexagram here

140
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,320
There is no skeleton of the King of Stars

141
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,200
This is an empty coffin

142
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:24,119
Who was the one who just took me?

143
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,239
who is so bold

144
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,520
Is it a treasure thief

145
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,599
impossible

146
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:37,159
If it is really according to what Li Zhu said

147
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,799
Then all these years

148
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:41,799
No one can come here from the pavilion of life and death

149
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:44,679
only one possibility

150
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,280
it's the guy in here

151
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:51,320
Who was the one who caught me just now?

152
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:54,479
ghost is ghost

153
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,640
from the moment we entered

154
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,799
Someone took the opportunity to kidnap Na Sheng

155
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:22,039
Then use Na Sheng's ring to open the coffin

156
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,599
Always feel something is wrong

157
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,119
The design of the coffin

158
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,440
as if waiting for someone to open it

159
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,479
who is waiting

160
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:45,719
who will open

161
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,760
Looks like there are other people in this tomb

162
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,760
Their purpose is also the Six Harmony Seal

163
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:00,960
Qingyuan

164
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,280
go see

165
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,840
Nasheng, recite an invisibility spell

166
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,320
Come out when it's safe

167
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,640
All right, you have to be careful

168
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,280
good

169
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:18,359
from beads

170
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,000
don't bother

171
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,640
witch

172
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,159
He even stepped into the mausoleum of King Xingzun

173
00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:26,239
You should have been executed

174
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,840
How could King Jiuyi let a guy like you

175
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,719
survived

176
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:42,320
This is the mausoleum of King Xingzun

177
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,640
You dare to rush

178
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:53,719
I want to ask who you are

179
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,479
he is the one

180
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,719
The guardian of the mausoleum of our Qing clan

181
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,919
But why are you alone here?

182
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,880
For hundreds of years

183
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,880
Mausoleum keeper escaped to death

184
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,840
It's long gone

185
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,440
As long as my old bones are

186
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,640
You don't even think about trespassing

187
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:14,679
This is Prince Kong Sang

188
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,719
Kongsang died a hundred years ago

189
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,080
What are you talking about, prince?

190
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:21,880
Since it's dead

191
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:24,840
Why are you still holding onto these tablets?

192
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:27,960
We are for the king

193
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,359
Is it the king of Kongsang or the king of Qing?

194
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,080
Even the Qing clan is for Kongsang

195
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,440
Whether you recognize me or not

196
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,320
Our purpose is the same

197
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,039
Where is the seal of six

198
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:48,280
Did you move the skeleton of the King of Stars?

199
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,080
skeleton

200
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:51,760
There is no king's skeleton from beginning to end

201
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,760
how is this possible

202
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,799
if there are no bones

203
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,320
Where is the real body of the King of Stars?

204
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,640
Be careful

205
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:18,520
don't chase

206
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:21,440
King Xingzun's Mausoleum is like an ant's nest

207
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,520
if there is no map

208
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,400
Even if the bead leads the way

209
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,520
also get lost

210
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:27,320
He's trying to lure us into the dark on purpose

211
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,479
who are you

212
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,080
There seems to be someone in there

213
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:34,640
everyone be careful

214
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:02,880
A Ying Su G

215
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,159
you

216
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:05,919
still alive

217
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,119
how so

218
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,840
before in the pavilion of life and death

219
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,599
The Heaven-defying Sword can split the water mist

220
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:37,039
I think it must be able to split weak water

221
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:38,679
But

222
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,119
Let's meet you all right now

223
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:42,320
Su G

224
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:44,479
thank you

225
00:16:46,359 --> 00:16:47,320
what to thank

226
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,280
don't say it again

227
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,400
I'm sorry, thank you, etc.

228
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,760
After leaving Jiuyi

229
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:00,719
I have something to say to you

230
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,199
Ok, I will wait for you

231
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,040
We found there was light ahead

232
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,239
come down this passage

233
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,719
just saw him

234
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,319
Sister Bai Ying

235
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
Great, great, you're still alive

236
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,040
You're not allowed to scare me like this again

237
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:20,040
so worry about you

238
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:23,839
Don't worry, I'm fine

239
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,479
it's fine

240
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,280
Worried Your Highness

241
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,520
Stay safe, Su G

242
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:46,920
A Ying

243
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,319
It's Qing Wangchen

244
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,079
Who is that person?

245
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,439
Qing Wangchen

246
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,599
Didn't he die a hundred years ago?

247
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:07,560
It seems that in the past hundred years

248
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,560
he's been living here

249
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:11,800
No news of him in a hundred years

250
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:14,280
It turned out that he was living in this mausoleum

251
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,119
Your Highness, is that the Seal of Six Harmonies?

252
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,359
Why does the emperor ring not respond?

253
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:53,400
go fast

254
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:06,719
How are you

255
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,719
You are hurt

256
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,000
come out of the way

257
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,079
what's the matter, ice cube brother

258
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:17,880
what's the matter

259
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,760
the seal just now

260
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,599
That's not a seal

261
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:22,640
Because Na Sheng's Emperor's Ring did not light up

262
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:24,239
That means

263
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,560
This is a trap set up by Qingchen

264
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:29,079
Where is that really sealed?

265
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:32,119
must be on him

266
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,800
Be careful

267
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,959
it's not safe here

268
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:37,880
Come with me first

269
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,719
quick

270
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:39,719
walk, walk, walk

271
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:41,479
I'll block the door and get out this way

272
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,040
hurry up

273
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:44,680
Uncle Xijing

274
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,000
Sister Bai Ying Sister Bai Ying

275
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,479
go fast

276
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:47,520
My perching star lamp perching star lamp

277
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,560
The star lamp is still inside

278
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,160
I come

279
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,719
go fast

280
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,239
We're blocked here too

281
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,599
what should we do

282
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:20,439
I've experienced it once before.

283
00:20:20,439 --> 00:20:21,640
This time it's a dead end

284
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:25,000
How about it

285
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:28,680
Thank you Haihuang for helping me take out the perched star lamp

286
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,800
He was injured by the explosion just now

287
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:41,520
also triggered a backlash

288
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:45,560
My trick is to catch turtles in the urn

289
00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:47,719
how are you guys

290
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,760
what sound

291
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,319
Blue dragon

292
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,199
This tomb is about to collapse

293
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:56,520
you all can't live

294
00:20:56,719 --> 00:20:58,400
will die here

295
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,040
Right now

296
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,079
The organs of the entire underground palace

297
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:02,640
It was all opened by that Qingchen

298
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,359
it's irreversible

299
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,479
what would happen

300
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:07,160
To prevent treasure thieves

301
00:21:07,439 --> 00:21:08,959
The agency will close all exits

302
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:10,239
no one can get out

303
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,079
Qingchen's fake seal

304
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,280
Broke one of the foundations of the underground palace

305
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:18,520
So I'm afraid the whole underground palace will collapse

306
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:21,079
from beads

307
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,560
you brought us here

308
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,560
Impossible to leave behind

309
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:24,760
export

310
00:21:28,439 --> 00:21:29,119
Let me try

311
00:21:57,959 --> 00:21:59,599
How can it be so impossible?

312
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,000
He clearly told me so

313
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:02,400
who told you that

314
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:03,719
Qingjun

315
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,000
he told me

316
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,719
Emergency moment

317
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:07,319
You can stick the star lamp on the stone pillar

318
00:22:07,719 --> 00:22:09,199
And use magic to copy the character of silence

319
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,599
In this way, the cave will open a secret passage.

320
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:12,439
can escape

321
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,000
Qing Jun was never found

322
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:17,040
How to enter the Mausoleum of King Xingzun

323
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,599
How could he know how to get out?

324
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,599
That's right

325
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:23,079
From the beginning

326
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:25,319
He just wanted to bury you here

327
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,760
Lizhu why did you lead us here

328
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,119
What kind of contract do you have with Qingjun?

329
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:37,479
from beads

330
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,040
tell everyone

331
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,920
turn off the lights

332
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,359
you told us before

333
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,280
It's your own choice

334
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,400
So I didn't pierce you

335
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:07,439
But so far

336
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,760
Do you still believe in Qingjun?

337
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,520
Xuan Huang Sutra says

338
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:14,599
This mausoleum has a very strong magic enchantment

339
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,079
Only the star-dwelling lamp of the King of Stars

340
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:18,119
to light up here

341
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:20,119
And this star lamp

342
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:21,640
need special people

343
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,199
to light up

344
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,319
yes yes yes

345
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:27,079
That light couldn't be lit in my hand before

346
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:28,239
Lights up in her hands

347
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,599
This star lamp burns

348
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,439
is the life of the lamp bearer

349
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:37,119
so scary

350
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:38,599
The longer you keep the lights on

351
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,439
Life will be consumed faster

352
00:23:41,479 --> 00:23:42,680
You've been holding the light for so long

353
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:44,680
Even if you complete the task that Qingjun gave you

354
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,599
The star lights go out

355
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,839
you will still die

356
00:23:49,199 --> 00:23:50,079
from beads

357
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,959
what exactly is it

358
00:23:56,439 --> 00:23:57,800
make you willing to give your life

359
00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:11,119
from beads

360
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:13,359
you really want for this lamp

361
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,239
give your life?

362
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:21,760
I co-starred with Qing Jun in this play

363
00:24:24,199 --> 00:24:26,560
It's because Qingjun once promised me

364
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:29,839
As long as I light the perched star lamp

365
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:32,400
lead you to the tunnel

366
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:35,239
And kill that Qingchen

367
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:38,160
He will set my family free

368
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,760
I clearly made a blood pact with him

369
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,839
But he

370
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,280
He has been from the beginning

371
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,680
Just planned to bury me here

372
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,560
Why

373
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,359
I tried my best

374
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:06,560
All I want is freedom

375
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:12,839
Even if only one day to live

376
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:17,280
I want to go back to that sea too

377
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:20,640
Sister Lizhu Sister Lizhu

378
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,880
Sorry

379
00:25:22,199 --> 00:25:22,719
Before

380
00:25:23,199 --> 00:25:24,920
I made you angry before

381
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,719
I can help you destroy this lamp

382
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:43,199
I can also kill Qingjun

383
00:25:43,199 --> 00:25:44,199
save your family

384
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:46,680
Because you have Quanxian's blood on you

385
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,160
I have to take you home

386
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:51,599
from beads

387
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,599
you believe me

388
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,959
still believe in yourself

389
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,920
Still believe that Qingjun

390
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:02,359
you decide

391
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:07,040
I believe you

392
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,599
Neptune

393
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,680
Xie Haihuang

394
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,319
Major General

395
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,319
The stone that seals the door has been moved in.

396
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:38,800
hold on

397
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,920
I don't know that you brought me here

398
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:14,359
what to say

399
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,160
Major General Yu Huan please

400
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,719
meet someone with me

401
00:27:18,959 --> 00:27:19,560
who to see

402
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,479
The real Jiuyi King

403
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,920
Meet King Jiuyi

404
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:27,719
Yu Huan has seen King Jiuyi

405
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,160
The Major General really lives up to his reputation

406
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,079
I can actually see that the medicine pill is for me

407
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,920
When I bring the elixir

408
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,079
Qingjun doesn't care

409
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:41,719
I know

410
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,839
People who really need medicine

411
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:44,920
not him

412
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,280
and

413
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,599
He has changed about Jiuyi Mountain

414
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:50,520
don't know

415
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,319
The Qing's soldiers didn't protect him either.

416
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:54,280
I will conclude

417
00:27:55,479 --> 00:27:57,800
The real King Jiuyi is someone else

418
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:03,560
Lord Prey sent you to come alone

419
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,839
For the arrest of Su G Zhenlan

420
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:09,199
follow-up plans

421
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:12,079
In my opinion, it is better to count

422
00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:16,119
lead them into the mausoleum

423
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:17,719
Why

424
00:28:18,719 --> 00:28:20,239
The Mausoleum of King Xingzun

425
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:21,560
hard to get in

426
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:24,040
It's harder to figure out

427
00:28:28,719 --> 00:28:30,880
Then let Miaozhu stay in the tomb for me

428
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:32,880
bait them

429
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:33,959
Yiyu Fantasy

430
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,280
You should do the bait yourself

431
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,880
If it were someone else

432
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:43,400
Presumably this Su G

433
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,160
It shouldn't be that easy to get hooked on.

434
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,640
If Qing Wang is worried

435
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:51,839
Can hold the seal of Liuhe

436
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:53,479
There are six seals in

437
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:55,800
Su G dare not do anything to you

438
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,239
The six seals

439
00:29:07,439 --> 00:29:09,439
Still sealed in the coffin

440
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,640
Requires Emperor Ring

441
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,359
to open the coffin

442
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,760
Yu Huan has seen King Jiuyi

443
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,479
King Jiuyi King Jiuyi

444
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,199
As the Major General expected

445
00:29:24,439 --> 00:29:25,560
Kill two birds with one stone

446
00:29:26,479 --> 00:29:27,479
Catching turtle in urn

447
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,640
Everyone is ambushing on this rocky cliff

448
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:42,640
Yes

449
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,359
wait

450
00:29:45,199 --> 00:29:45,880
who are you

451
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,119
I am Major General Cang Liu

452
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,839
Fei Lian

453
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:51,959
less bullshit

454
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:53,599
How dare you pretend to be me

455
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:58,079
Lord Shilang's Jialing plaque is here

456
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:00,079
who dares

457
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,719
it is true

458
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:09,839
Then the lieutenant

459
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,839
can you take a look at your token

460
00:30:18,479 --> 00:30:19,920
You are the girl who throws her arms around you

461
00:30:20,199 --> 00:30:21,119
you are the girl

462
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,000
How dare you be so rude to this general

463
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:23,959
take it for me

464
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:27,160
what are you doing

465
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,560
Who is this listening to?

466
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,599
you little thief

467
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,880
should take you down

468
00:30:36,199 --> 00:30:36,920
squad leader

469
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:38,439
Shall we go help?

470
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,479
what help

471
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:40,959
do you know who they are

472
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,280
Why have you tried so many ways?

473
00:30:53,479 --> 00:30:54,920
Still can't break the barrier

474
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,800
Weak above, soul below

475
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,119
The boundary of this

476
00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:59,199
the ancestors of Kongsang

477
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:00,400
Continued with the blessing of mana

478
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,520
unbreakable

479
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,280
Otherwise, the weak water will break through the barrier and go down

480
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:05,040
It will damage the coffin of the King of Stars

481
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,079
and the thrones of the kings

482
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,880
what to do then

483
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:09,400
We're not going to die here are we?

484
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,880
The emperor didn't use the lightsaber either.

485
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:21,520
Let's fight like this

486
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,520
when is it over

487
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:23,880
Why don't we go our separate ways

488
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:25,280
You go to Yuhuan

489
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,199
How about I go to the young master

490
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:32,920
Be careful

491
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,680
thanks

492
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:49,400
not shaking

493
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,680
Will the mountain not collapse?

494
00:31:53,439 --> 00:31:54,439
How is this going

495
00:32:01,199 --> 00:32:02,359
what what

496
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:10,880
What's this

497
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,479
wait

498
00:32:13,479 --> 00:32:14,680
It's dodder, don't hurt her

499
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:17,920
Dodder

500
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,839
This is dodder

501
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:23,119
she is a shark

502
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,400
Saved me and Su G in the foggy forest

503
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:30,800
See Neptune, I'm late

504
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,880
how are you hurt

505
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
Farewell to the foggy forest

506
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:37,000
I was ordered to find Bai Lin

507
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,359
I saw her and that major general in Cang Liu

508
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:40,400
conspiring together

509
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,719
I caught her after she left alone

510
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:44,760
But after she tore up all the vines

511
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,560
Ran away

512
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,319
missing

513
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,880
you say liner

514
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,000
how could she be so cruel

515
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:51,160
why should i lie to you

516
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:52,119
dodder girl

517
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,719
You can go to this underground palace

518
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,839
Can you show us a way out

519
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,640
It's you

520
00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:08,319
dodder girl

521
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,239
what's wrong with you

522
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:12,439
don't you remember me

523
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,640
we have seen

524
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:20,400
I'm confused

525
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,160
you can't be him

526
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,560
but you

527
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,599
You look so alike

528
00:33:29,239 --> 00:33:30,479
me we

529
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,560
what are we like

530
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,520
The world is but fate

531
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:39,520
do you want it

532
00:33:39,719 --> 00:33:40,400
fine

533
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,119
A dirty thing got in there

534
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,359
Lizhu, you are so damned

535
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,640
get out of the way what are you gonna do

536
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,280
it's not your turn to speak

537
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,439
Neptune

538
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,400
She's the one who tricked everyone into coming here

539
00:33:59,160 --> 00:33:59,880
don't blame her

540
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,239
She was also deceived by Qing Jun

541
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,880
I'll open a channel in a while

542
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:07,239
Do you know the way down the mountain?

543
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,280
if you dare to betray

544
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,439
I will take your father and brother to the misty forest

545
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,360
make them the most miserable monsters

546
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,719
Neptune

547
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,879
I will open a passage to the back mountain for a while

548
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,080
In this way, everyone can get out of Jiuyi Mountain.

549
00:34:25,479 --> 00:34:26,040
good

550
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,800
Once the agency is opened

551
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:32,399
won't close

552
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,399
Su G is not so easy to die

553
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,239
But they can't let them escape easily.

554
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,840
Dodder Dodder

555
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:03,439
Someone is setting fire

556
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,760
The cane I held the passage was burned

557
00:35:05,879 --> 00:35:06,879
Maybe not long

558
00:35:07,919 --> 00:35:08,560
Feather magic

559
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,719
This tomb may be collapsing

560
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:47,520
go away

561
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:48,679
I'll go first

562
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,679
you follow

563
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,159
What's wrong with Feather

564
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,679
Fire is broken

565
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,280
they escaped

566
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,239
Send troops to chase

567
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:33,159
hold on

568
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,639
Your Highness is here

569
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,280
Su G will not come

570
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,280
The seal of Liuhe is with you, right?

571
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:41,879
what their emperor can perceive

572
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:48,919
you want to use me as bait

573
00:36:48,919 --> 00:36:50,199
Now we can only fight

574
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,600
I try my best to keep you safe

575
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:54,320
from beads

576
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,080
Take them down this road

577
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,600
etc

578
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,080
We haven't found any water droplets yet

579
00:37:00,479 --> 00:37:02,239
Did you go to Queen Baiwei's tomb?

580
00:37:02,479 --> 00:37:03,120
went

581
00:37:03,479 --> 00:37:04,360
but not found

582
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,159
dodder girl

583
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,320
Do you know where the water droplets are?

584
00:37:09,399 --> 00:37:10,479
what are you looking for

585
00:37:10,879 --> 00:37:12,679
We only got the water drop

586
00:37:12,959 --> 00:37:15,159
Only then can Su G take Na Sheng to Guishenyuan

587
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,879
Unravel the Six Seals

588
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,959
Are they telling the truth?

589
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,919
water droplets

590
00:37:26,439 --> 00:37:27,800
is no longer in the tomb

591
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,840
where is that

592
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:35,439
Dodder, are you alright?

593
00:37:43,439 --> 00:37:45,560
What's going on with these leaves?

594
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,080
Dodder girl, what's the matter with you?

595
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I heal you

596
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:57,520
No

597
00:37:58,479 --> 00:37:59,199
Useless

598
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,120
hurry up

599
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,239
This is the last thing I can do for you

600
00:38:04,479 --> 00:38:05,719
To save us

601
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:07,840
You paid such a high price

602
00:38:11,879 --> 00:38:12,760
dodder girl

603
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,120
Such kindness

604
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,719
Kong Sang is unforgettable

605
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:23,560
you are softer than him

606
00:38:28,399 --> 00:38:30,399
Dodder girl this from the beginning

607
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:33,320
It's like you know me

608
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:36,280
seven thousand years ago

609
00:38:36,919 --> 00:38:39,399
I fell in love with a boy from an exotic land

610
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,000
because of him

611
00:38:46,439 --> 00:38:48,320
I have committed an unforgivable sin

612
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,840
I don't know if it's fate or what

613
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,800
let me meet you again

614
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:54,840
Kong Sang's Prince

615
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,280
You have a different look from him

616
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,040
I hope you have a different ending

617
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:02,080
The six-height seal to be unlocked

618
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,399
Please unlock this Jiuyi barrier

619
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,360
Let the light through the foggy forest

620
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:10,560
So kids can turn into clouds

621
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,520
With the wind flowing to the blue sea

622
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
don't worry

623
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:34,800
This is

624
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:36,320
This is water droplets

625
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,719
I rely on it to absorb weak water

626
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,320
Survive in Jiuyi Forest

627
00:39:41,919 --> 00:39:43,520
The water pearl is originally the thing of the emperor of the sea

628
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,360
It was given to Bai Wei seven thousand years ago

629
00:39:47,479 --> 00:39:49,760
Bai Wei was kept in the tomb after her death

630
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:51,439
I stole it

631
00:39:51,879 --> 00:39:53,840
I just don't want it to stay with Bai Wei

632
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:54,959
now

633
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,199
It's time to return the emperor

634
00:39:57,959 --> 00:40:00,719
Chun Huang gave it to Queen Bai Wei

635
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,280
Dodder, what happened to your body

636
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,600
Dodder

637
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,000
so kind

638
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,399
I must remember

639
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:16,919
A new generation of Neptune

640
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,800
I can only protect you here

641
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,760
Please be sure to defeat Cang Liu

642
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:25,080
With the people of Quanxian

643
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:27,600
Back to our hometown Biluohai

644
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,879
dodder, what's wrong with you

645
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,000
I was already dead

646
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,679
Only by this Jiuyi Mountain and Weak Shui

647
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:36,560
stuck here

648
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,080
Trapped in this sac and can't be freed

649
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:42,479
Now I finally got what I wanted

650
00:40:43,439 --> 00:40:44,840
finally die

651
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,320
take the kids away

652
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:49,760
Turn them into clouds

653
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,600
rise to the sky

654
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,560
Sprinkle back to the blue sea

655
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:58,600
Ya burn this is my name

656
00:40:59,439 --> 00:41:00,679
Please remember Neptune

657
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:01,919
Ya burning

658
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:04,239
Quan Xian's Heroic Soul Record

659
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,520
must have your name

660
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,360
go away

661
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,080
I will definitely fulfill your wish

662
00:41:27,959 --> 00:41:28,919
to avenge you

663
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,120
A new generation of Neptune

664
00:41:31,959 --> 00:41:33,639
you have a soft heart

665
00:41:36,959 --> 00:41:38,199
Usually no one comes

666
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:39,159
should be safe

667
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:40,800
sit down

668
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,080
good

669
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,800
Nasheng

670
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,080
The water droplets will be handed over to you

671
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,800
I will cherish it

672
00:42:03,919 --> 00:42:04,719
this kindness

673
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,800
On behalf of Kong Sang, I thank Quan Xian

674
00:42:08,479 --> 00:42:10,120
Only to overthrow those who are

675
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,320
It's not worth losing so many people

676
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,040
Yes

677
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:16,719
The most important thing now is to find the seal

678
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,239
Nasheng

679
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,439
See if the emperor reacts

680
00:42:40,399 --> 00:42:41,280
seems to be over there

681
00:42:43,479 --> 00:42:44,479
It's Qingchen

682
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:49,679

683
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,639

684
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,000
