Xiao?

00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,839
Sent someone into the river

4
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,599
Possibly poisoned by the ghost red Yan

5
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,720
turned into stone

you become i don't know you

8
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,240
You looked so cruel just now

9
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,559
full of killing

10
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,279
Is your heart made of iron?

11
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,000
But Quan Xian

12
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,679
Just sent spies from the army

How to talk about mercy

15
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,240
you want to say

16
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,800
Today's affairs also have my share

17
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,559
Why don't you execute me too

18
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,000
Xiao and you are born and die

19
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,399
so loyal

20
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,720
Remember the past love

21
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,800
neither should you

22
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:39,119
loyalty

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,039
loyalty you say

24
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,639
It's the two of you partnering

25
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,559
Come and lie to me for the antidote

26
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,839
you know the ghost red yan

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,759
you say

28
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,520
Why do not you say it

29
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,679
I know you too well

30
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,759
Every time you stop talking

31
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:03,399
Must have his own reasons

32
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:09,119
did someone force you to do this

33
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,360
Who gave you the ghost red Yan?

34
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,759
A mere cheap

What to do with Cang Liu

37
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:21,039
but

38
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,199
Since you've come to plead for him yourself

39
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:27,119
I can give him a chance

40
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,679
I want you

41
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:33,960
put this in the waterway

42
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:35,919
Thank you Lord Prey for giving Fei Lian a chance

43
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,199
Feather Magic and Fei Lian

44
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,880
I will do my best to stop Su Mo

45
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:47,679
you don't have to know

46
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,440
Feather magic

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,639
If you don't say I'm Feilian, I'll be with you

48
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,119
parted ways

49
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:53,880
Fei Lian

50
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,800
The vicissitudes are far darker than you think

51
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,520
Why do I treat Xiao like this

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,600
you know

53
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,320
on the mirror tower

54
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,399
in the temple

55
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:05,720
There is a man of prey

56
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,080
Adult

57
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,600
right

58
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,759
higher than the fifth division

59
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,039
true ruler

60
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:14,839
Ghost Red Yan

61
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:16,760
He gave me the last chance

62
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:18,839
let me find a way

63
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,440
Stop Su G from entering the Sleepy Dragon Abyss

64
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,839
free dragon god

65
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,399
Yuhuan, make it clear

66
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,799
what is the last chance

67
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,959
Yes

68
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:27,799
from a famous family like you

69
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:28,720
Of course I don't understand

70
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,640
do you know

71
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:31,799
in Cangliu

72
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,880
a humble person like me

73
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,399
How hard is it not to be bullied?

74
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:39,239
only stand out

75
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:40,640
just become stronger

76
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:42,600
I have been defeated by Su G many times

77
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,559
Shi Peng regards me as an abandoned child

78
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,320
Shi Luo and Shi Lang wish I would die soon

79
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,440
good to not stop your future

80
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,959
If it wasn't for me to take refuge in the prey

81
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,640
My sister and I are now

82
00:04:57,679 --> 00:04:59,600
I'm afraid I don't know what it looks like

83
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:07,519
Feather magic

84
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:08,839
where did you go

85
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,000
sleepy dragon abyss

86
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,000
You can't go too dangerous

87
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:19,839
you are from childhood

88
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,440
So well protected by the family

89
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,079
too simple

90
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,079
I tell you

91
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,839
As long as my sister and I don't get bullied

92
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,720
I'm willing to pay any price

93
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,000
Feather magic

94
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,040
Feather magic

95
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,359
Feather magic

96
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,239
Feather magic

97
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,640
Major General, you can't go out

98
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:48,399
Feather magic

99
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,839
It's quiet here

100
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,519
make people feel

101
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,320
a little weird

102
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,839
I can't seem to feel the presence of any living thing

103
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,559
i can feel

104
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:13,079
There is a strong mind

105
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,399
we should be

106
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,279
stuck here

107
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,600
Those eyes appeared again

108
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,399
Those eyes and these visions

109
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,320
what does it matter

110
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,440
Perhaps from these illusions

111
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,920
Find clues about the sleepy dragon rope

112
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:42,440
I heard that a man from Yunhuang came to Longxiao Palace

113
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,320
very curious

114
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,679
Just let Chunhuang show me

115
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,399
This is Ya Ran, born to our mother

116
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,640
Hi Ya Ran

117
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,760
Just call me Bai Wei

118
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,679
hello baiwei

119
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:53,399
How about it

120
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,959
Are you used to eating?

121
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:56,920
these

122
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,399
They were all just caught from Biluohai.

123
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,200
it's fresh

124
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,000
you try it

125
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,440
taste

126
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:18,880
How about it

127
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:21,559
good to eat

128
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,440
then you eat more

129
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,440
put it here

130
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,079
Come

131
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:22,040
put it here

132
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:29,440
What's this

133
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,239
for you

134
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,119
is fish soup

135
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,840
drink it hot

136
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:50,799
delicious

137
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,799
I didn't think about it before

138
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:55,080
Then I asked the elder

139
00:08:55,239 --> 00:08:56,200
Only know the people of Yunhuang

140
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,239
accustomed to eating hot

141
00:08:58,599 --> 00:08:59,479
you caught me

142
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:04,239
Unexpectedly, Yunhuang and Biluohai

143
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,719
There's such a big difference

144
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,760
Can you tell me the story of Yunhuang

145
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,799
OK

146
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,320
once

147
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,520
Fifth brother took me to sneak off the boat to see the sea of ​​flowers

148
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,080
There is a huge moon orchid there

149
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,159
open under the moon

150
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:42,119
I didn't expect it to be so interesting

151
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,919
I really envy you

152
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:46,919
so many interesting things to see

153
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:49,440
wait till i get better

154
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,119
You can look back to Hai County with me.

155
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,000
there is my hometown

156
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,239
There are a lot of delicious and fun

157
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,559
good

158
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:57,640
I also hope that

159
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,400
Have the opportunity to go to the outside world

160
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:00,440
take a good look

161
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,159
drink it

162
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,840
Come

163
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,039
This fantasy is so real

164
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,960
Through the eyes of Queen Baiwei

165
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,760
Not only can you taste the taste of the soup

166
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:26,760
I can feel her mood

167
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,640
Did you find any clues in the vision?

168
00:10:29,239 --> 00:10:30,440
nothing special

169
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:31,640
are some everyday

170
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,039
Queen Bai Wei doesn't seem to be abnormal either.

171
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,159
but

172
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,960
even in fantasy

173
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:38,559
I can also clearly feel

174
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,760
There's a pair of eyes looking at me

175
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:43,559
to find those eyes

176
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:46,559
Maybe it's the key to finding the sleepy dragon rope

177
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:03,400
You just started practicing swords when your body is just right.

178
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,719
I can't stand it anyway

179
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:05,960
Why are you looking for me?

180
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,320
this is for you

181
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:11,799
This is

182
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:12,799
This is water droplets

183
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,719
You Yunhuang people can't breathe freely here

184
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:18,039
Chunhuang cast a spell on you before

185
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,760
But spells are time-consuming

186
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,039
This water droplet is different.

187
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:22,840
you put it on

188
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,200
You can move freely in the blue sea

189
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,159
Thank you Ya Ran

190
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,400
no need to thank me

191
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,200
If you want to thank you, thank you Chunhuang

192
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:32,080
This bead is hard to make

193
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,159
To use Master Minghuo's Bizhu

194
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,520
Plus Izumi's spell

195
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,719
He spent a lot of mana doing this.

196
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,679
He put so much effort into this bead

197
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,479
then I can't

198
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,119
Let's send things to friends first

199
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:46,080
never mind

200
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,880
if you give him back

201
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,000
he will be sad

202
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,960
then i also need

203
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,000
Just go and say thank you to him in person

204
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,159
Then by the way ask him what he needs

205
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:58,799
if it can be done

206
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:00,280
I will pay him back this favor

207
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,039
if you really treat us as friends

208
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:03,679
You don't have to think about thank you all the time.

209
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:05,840
good

210
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:12,359
It turned out to be water droplets

211
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,440
It was when Chunhuang passed Ya Ran

212
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:15,719
For Queen Baiwei

213
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,760
No wonder it appeared on Ya Ran later

214
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:20,440
from the situation

215
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:22,960
The relationship between Queen Baiwei and Ya Ran

216
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,239
It should be very good

217
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,400
But why did Ya Ran appear in Jiuyi Mountain?

218
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,320
Turned into a dodder in the foggy forest again

219
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:31,520
and from her words

220
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:33,440
Also full of resentment towards Queen Baiwei

221
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,719
what happened after

222
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:36,520
we do not know

223
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,479
Maybe the eyes you said

224
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:40,880
It's Ya Ran

225
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,119
unlike

226
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:47,679
This phantom deliberately allows us to see

227
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:48,880
seven thousand years ago

228
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,159
maybe

229
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,200
is giving us a hint

230
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,280
is to imply us

231
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,640
what happened to them

232
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,719
the same will happen to us

233
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,080
girl baiwei

234
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,359
I am Quanxian's Si Shi Ming Huo

235
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,799
On the orders of Young Master Chunhuang

236
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:18,919
For your friend who died at sea

237
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,760
Held the Spring Festival Ceremony

238
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:22,599
Thank you Ming Huo Si

239
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,400
Hope the Dragon God will protect you

240
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,880
May your companions return home

241
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:55,760
hope they

242
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,000
Able to gain peace and stability

243
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,119
Hope the Dragon God will protect you

244
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,520
May your companions return home

245
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,919
hope they get

246
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:55,159
calm

247
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,599
and stable

248
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,159
Thank you for everything you have done for me

249
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,559
what is this place

250
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:23,440
This is our forbidden place.

251
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:25,400
Dragon Cave

252
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,919
Are there really dragons here?

253
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:32,679
i tell you a secret

254
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:34,200
you can't tell anyone

255
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,919
Now is the time when the Dragon God is sleeping and changing his bones

256
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:39,840
So we can get close

257
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:42,719
change bone

258
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,479
Dragon God changes bones every five hundred years

259
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:47,960
ten years

260
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,880
Do the math now

261
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:52,599
It should have just lost one

262
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,039
a what

263
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:56,440
dragon tooth

264
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,440
I saw you tense just now

265
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:01,919
thought you were unhappy

266
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,239
Maybe it's the song that Ming Huo just heard.

267
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:10,119
Then suddenly I feel homesick

268
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,440
It's our poor care

269
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,559
or you don't like it

270
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,679
no no

271
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,320
You take good care of me

272
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:18,039
I just miss my family.

273
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,559
when can i go home

274
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,359
You now

275
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:25,719
not healed

276
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:27,640
Biluohai is in the tide season

277
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:28,880
The wind and waves are big

278
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:30,799
It's dangerous to go out

279
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:32,280
A big wave came

280
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:33,799
No boat can escape

281
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,640
But he must be worried about me

282
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:43,479
If you still miss home

283
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,280
you can call this your home

284
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,679
treat us like your family

285
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,640
Different

286
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,680
Why did you bring it here yourself?

287
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,439
i'm just curious

288
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,359
Why pick so many flowers

289
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,079
nice one

290
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,959
you help me get the bud first

291
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:30,079
Can you take them off one by one?

292
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:30,959
good

293
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:00,680
what are you looking at me

294
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,199
nothing

295
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,199
smell it

296
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,119
smell good

297
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,319
this heart flower

298
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:45,800
It's unique to you

299
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,040
it tastes very special

300
00:18:47,439 --> 00:18:49,119
It must be delicious for brewing

301
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,239
these wines

302
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:53,400
You made it all for me

303
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,599
One day I'm leaving

304
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:59,359
so before leaving

305
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:00,880
I want to leave you some gifts

306
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,560
As a repayment to you and Ya Ran

307
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,760
Take care of me during this time

308
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,079
This is our craftsmanship

309
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,520
The wine we make is especially sweet

310
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,000
you want to go home

311
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,000
I've been away from home for a long time

312
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,920
But before you go

313
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,400
This wine is not ready

314
00:19:21,719 --> 00:19:22,479
what to do

315
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,520
like this

316
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,040
seal it in the vat

317
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,439
You can drink it after a month

318
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:32,199
drinking alone

319
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:34,239
Isn't it just to drink alcohol to relieve anxiety?

320
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,359
What did you say

321
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,160
i said i remembered

322
00:19:43,439 --> 00:19:45,119
But I still want to drink with you

323
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,119
OK

324
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,280
Then I try to drink this wine with you

325
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:50,479
good

326
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,439
you find me

327
00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:16,479
you come, sit down

328
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,160
give you a try

329
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,199
taste

330
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,599
How about it

331
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,119
what is this

332
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,119
why so spicy

333
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,719
It's not water

334
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,560
You do not

335
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:05,800
You were drinking

336
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,079
so interesting

337
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,880
one more drink, one more drink, one more drink

338
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,719
no no no no no

339
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,719
we were not allowed to drink

340
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,160
Well, I'll try it

341
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:25,319
It tastes almost like my hometown.

342
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,880
pure brilliance

343
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,520
this as

344
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,319
my parting gift

345
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,599
finish this wine

346
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,079
are you leaving

347
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,079
I can't be here all the time

348
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:53,160
It's hard work to lead a war.

349
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,280
This is my responsibility to be born into the Bai family

350
00:21:57,959 --> 00:21:59,520
When we meet and part ways

351
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,880
Chun Huang, glad to meet you

352
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:04,959
Me too

353
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,000
By the way, this wine doesn't have a name yet.

354
00:22:09,439 --> 00:22:10,520
Help me think of a name

355
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:12,439
And this letter

356
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,760
Please help me send it to Wanghai County

357
00:22:16,199 --> 00:22:17,400
Give it to Langgan

358
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,000
my family will pick me up

359
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:20,000
good

360
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:04,560
Bai Wei

361
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:06,920
Your letter will be delivered

362
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,359
You will be able to reunite with your family soon

363
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,839
Previously in Sleepy Dragon Terrace

364
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:16,280
I saw how Queen Bai Wei died

365
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,439
Chunhuang was present

366
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,640
And the King of Stars

367
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:24,040
But the King of Stars has not yet appeared

368
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:25,560
it's weird

369
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,439
maybe

370
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,959
After the King of Stars appeared

371
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:30,920
we can leave this fantasy

372
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,280
Look

373
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,359
Those eyes appeared again

374
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,359
Avi

375
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:06,199
alang

376
00:24:06,199 --> 00:24:07,359
you are really here

377
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,479
pure brilliance

378
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,560
This is Lang Gan who grew up with me

379
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,880
This is the sea emperor who saved my life

380
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,640
His Royal Highness Chun Huang

381
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,800
Thank you for saving your life

382
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,160
you haven't seen each other for a long time

383
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,800
I won't bother

384
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:31,359
why did you come

385
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,920
I was ten days ago

386
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,400
Let Chunhuang send the letter to you

387
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,520
I thought you all

388
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,239
what letter

389
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,920
did you not receive the letter

390
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,000
no

391
00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:42,560
I am through astrology

392
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,239
Find your trail on the cloud

393
00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:45,199
Just came here

394
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:48,760
It's not safe here

395
00:24:49,199 --> 00:24:50,040
let's go

396
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,800
unsafe

397
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,479
They are all good to me

398
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,319
very good

399
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:57,239
I came here a few days ago

400
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,920
trapped by a shark

401
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,760
And she told me

402
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,680
say you're in love with someone else

403
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:03,839
like someone else

404
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:05,959
How can I fall in love with someone else?

405
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:09,760
Yes

406
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,040
Avi

407
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,280
How can you fall in love with someone else

408
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:41,599
poor care

409
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,560
I don't know if everyone is used to it

410
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:47,119
I've gotten used to it

411
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:48,479
but alang

412
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,079
He may not be used to it yet

413
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,280
This bead was given to me by Chunhuang

414
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,640
I can go in the water with it on

415
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,400
Brother Lang

416
00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:03,880
I toast you

417
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,959
This is Bai Wei's own wine

418
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:10,040
can't you drink?

419
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:11,520
i drink less

420
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,439
i can hold back

421
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,160
Don't let yourself blow bubbles

422
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:23,760
Thanks for the hospitality

423
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,959
Right, Ya Ran?

424
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:44,560
Ya Ran, she is not feeling well

425
00:26:44,959 --> 00:26:45,839
rest in the room

426
00:26:47,479 --> 00:26:48,520
Then let's go see her

427
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,439
it does not matter

428
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,359
She needs some rest

429
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:54,239
you stay here a few more days

430
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:56,079
to see her again

431
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:57,280
Yunhuang's war is complicated

432
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,079
I am afraid

433
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,479
can't stay long

434
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:08,400
what happened to the cloud

435
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,680
Cangliu people sneak attack on Wanghai County

436
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:14,479
Your father was seriously injured and is now recuperating

437
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:16,760
you came to pick me up

438
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,359
instead of my father coming to pick me up

439
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,760
we go back now

440
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:22,760
to fight off those scumbags

441
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,400
don't worry

442
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,839
Even if the two of us are fast

443
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:26,000
also to no avail

444
00:27:30,199 --> 00:27:31,560
You two have the people in your heart

445
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,959
The war is so tight

446
00:27:35,439 --> 00:27:37,400
I will definitely assist you

447
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:39,839
you are still here

448
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:41,439
Please forgive the Dragon God

449
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:47,680
Why did the emperor of the sea want to take my dragon tooth?

450
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,280
I have been blessed by the Dragon God for all generations

451
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:51,719
happy and healthy life

452
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:53,800
But in the cloudless land thousands of miles away

453
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,199
The people there are suffering from the turmoil of war

454
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,119
This time I met two friends from Yunhuang

455
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:02,719
They want to quell the war in Yunhuang

456
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,760
Bring peace to the cloud

457
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,479
Although I am Quanxian's sea emperor

458
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,439
But I also want to help them

459
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,040
Therefore

460
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,880
borrow

461
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,719
Borrow Dragon Tooth

462
00:29:16,439 --> 00:29:18,760
I want to make a heaven-defying sword and give it to them

463
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:20,959
Heavenly Sword

464
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,839
you want them to unravel

465
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:27,199
The azure lock that seals the sign and protects the power

466
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,880
Do you know

467
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,920
When these two ancient forces reappeared in the world

468
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,520
may cause unrest

469
00:29:38,719 --> 00:29:39,479
I know

470
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:41,920
So these two forces will be sealed

471
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,319
Neptune

472
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,439
you make this decision now

473
00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:47,359
will be forever

474
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,560
the last time i ask you

475
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,640
do you really want to do this

476
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,760
I believe in Bai Wei

477
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,640
She is the kindest woman in the world

478
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,280
also have the spirit of the common people

479
00:30:00,239 --> 00:30:01,079
i believe her

480
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,839
Will definitely give Yunhuang peace

481
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,640
By the time

482
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,199
Quan Xian is friendly with Kong Sang

483
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,079
world peace

484
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,199
Isn't it the greatest good thing

485
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:16,000
ok i promise you

486
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,000
But you must remember

487
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,119
The only way to fight against nothingness

488
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:26,680
Only create and protect

489
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,119
dragon god what does this mean

490
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,439
This is the revelation given by the ancestors to the sea emperor

491
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:36,880
You have to figure it out yourself

492
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:06,319
May this prophecy

493
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:10,119
never come true

494
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,040
There is an island in the middle of Mirror Lake

495
00:31:28,199 --> 00:31:30,359
Sealed with sign and protection

496
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:31,520
Two ancient powers

497
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,239
As long as these two forces are available

498
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:38,160
In the cloudless desert, no one is invincible

499
00:31:38,959 --> 00:31:40,359
Why is this power sealed

500
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:41,760
who sealed it

501
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,680
Someone once got these two powers

502
00:31:44,439 --> 00:31:45,400
unify the cloud

503
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,160
But then out of control

504
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,160
these two forces

505
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,920
Sealed in this small island in the middle of Mirror Lake

506
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:54,760
no one can get near it

507
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,479
such a powerful force

508
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,520
I don't know if it's a blessing or a curse

509
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,079
In fact, the power itself

510
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,560
There was no distinction between good and evil

511
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,160
As long as the two forces of levy and protection are allowed to

512
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,000
coordinate with each other

513
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,680
will not lose balance

514
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:19,839
I don't know how to get this power

515
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:23,119
Open the cyan lock

516
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,959
to break the seal

517
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:25,719
how to open

518
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:29,000
go down

519
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,640
please sit

520
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:41,000
open it

521
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:52,280
so powerful

522
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,640
This is the Heavenly Sword

523
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,800
It is made with the teeth of the dragon god

524
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,040
The power of the dragon god is hidden inside

525
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,239
with it

526
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,160
open the golden lock

527
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,880
unseal

528
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:07,239
I want to give it to you

529
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,760
as a cloud

530
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:10,839
Izumi destination

531
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,199
The gift of friendship

532
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,599
You want such a precious Heaven-defying sword

533
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:16,239
give us

534
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:18,599
hope you can find

535
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,160
Protect the power of Yunhuang

536
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:25,800
The gift of the sword is unforgettable

537
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:28,359
Hope to see you again someday

538
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,479
Avi

539
00:33:43,199 --> 00:33:44,079
By the way, Chunhuang

540
00:33:44,719 --> 00:33:46,760
Have you thought about the name of this wine?

541
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:52,880
just call it

542
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,400
recollection

543
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,199
Good name

544
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,719
Chunhuang I will miss you

545
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:04,000
I miss Quan Xian

546
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,520
if someday

547
00:34:06,719 --> 00:34:08,399
Ah Lang and I can calm down the deserted clouds

548
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:10,000
we will definitely be back

549
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,360
repay your kindness

550
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,360
the scar on your hand

551
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,080
It was when I went to Jiuyi to pick up the Heavenly Sword.

552
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:36,919
left over

553
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,560
Chunhuang seven thousand years ago

554
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,000
I have scars like yours on my hands

555
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,760
The two prophecies that Dragon God told Chun Huang just now

556
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,000
Before on the Tianque Snow Mountain

557
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,239
Nasheng also helped me with divination

558
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,239
The only way to fight against nothingness

559
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,879
Only create and protect

560
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:02,439
Since we entered the trapped dragon

561
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:05,080
This one thing after another

562
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,879
It seems that there is a certain number in the dark

563
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,360
Not only are we the same as them

564
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,040
This sea shell pearl prays for blessings to protect the sword

565
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,399
And the scar on your hand

566
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:15,679
those prophecies

567
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,560
There are too many similarities

568
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:20,800
Even if it is a given fate

569
00:35:21,479 --> 00:35:22,399
we are us

570
00:35:22,879 --> 00:35:23,959
they are them

571
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:25,919
I never believed in fate

572
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,040
I don't know what will happen after

573
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,360
Turmoil in the cloud

574
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:32,120
I'm afraid it's all related to sign and protection

575
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,320
These two forces are related

576
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:38,159
The first year of Taichu

577
00:35:38,919 --> 00:35:42,239
The Queen and the Queen Climb to the Mirror Lake Island

578
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:43,879
gold lock

579
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:54,439

00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:32,280
Nanami Arahira

00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,280
The first ten years

588
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:45,919
The envoy of Quanxian brought treasures to the audience

589
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:57,800
alang

590
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,040

00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,760
I am ordered by the Emperor of the Sea

595
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:32,840
I came here to congratulate Kong Sang on the unification of the six wastes

596
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:36,639
Neptune has always respected King Xingzun and Queen Baiwei

597
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,879
The wise god Wu Ze and all sentient beings

598
00:37:39,919 --> 00:37:42,320
Therefore, I would like to form an alliance with Kong Sang.

599
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,159
This is the treasure I brought Quan Xian to show my sincerity

600
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,120
Hope to communicate with Kongsang generation

00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,439

606
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,159

Ya Ran long time no see

608
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,679
We didn't see you last time we left

609
00:38:18,479 --> 00:38:20,000
almost ten years

610
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:29,159
Otherwise, let's go over there and have a good chat

611
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:32,199
Ah Lang, he should have other things to do

612
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:35,879
good

613
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,560
Me and Ah Lang have been fighting for many years in Yunhuang

00:38:50,919 --> 00:38:51,959
life at risk

615
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,320
Looking at the empty sang now

616
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,120
I can't believe it myself

617
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:57,719
Of course

618
00:38:57,959 --> 00:38:59,120
If it weren't for you and Chun Huang

619
00:38:59,399 --> 00:39:00,479
Helped in the first place

620
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:01,879
days like this

621
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:03,800
I don't know when it will come

622
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,120
I came to the mirror city

623
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,560
see you as a queen

624
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,879
Supported by the people

625
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,399
sincerely happy for you

626
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,760
you are fighting for the common people

627
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,879
It's destiny for you

628
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,239
By the way, I just wanted to ask you

629
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,840
When were you born?

630
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,040
just before

631
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,239
When I am sick

632
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,679
It can make us Princess Ya Ran's favorite

633
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,280
Must be a handsome man

634
00:39:28,439 --> 00:39:30,239
an exotic prince

635
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:33,120
He used to carry only a sword

636
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,280
Drift to the blue sea

637
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,280
I saved him and healed him

638
00:39:37,919 --> 00:39:39,399
But he has a heart

639
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,120
I was born for him

640
00:39:41,959 --> 00:39:43,320
I've been wrong all my life

641
00:40:12,439 --> 00:40:13,560
you are not from here

642
00:40:14,399 --> 00:40:15,959
inability to breathe underwater

643
00:40:16,919 --> 00:40:19,360
I only have to set up a water formation to heal your wounds

644
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:57,040
no go no go

645
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,800
not allowed to go

646
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,840
I do not go

647
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,679
If I don't go, let go of your hands

648
00:41:06,399 --> 00:41:07,239
i won't let go

649
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,239
i won't let go

650
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,919
I won't let go

651
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:32,320
why do you keep going

652
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:37,239
I only have her in my heart

653
00:41:37,959 --> 00:41:38,800
i'm going to find her

654
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:42,600
she's already in love with someone else

655
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,560
don't go

656
00:41:50,919 --> 00:41:53,320
you don't go you don't go

657
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:13,959
Ya burning

658
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,840
you are born

659
00:42:16,439 --> 00:42:18,679
Chunhuang, I did something wrong

660
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:20,760
i'm sore

661
00:42:21,919 --> 00:42:23,000
why it hurts so much

662
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,120
You are in love with a stranger

663
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,639
I was wrong

664
00:42:27,439 --> 00:42:28,600
I did wrong

665
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,879
The most painful thing in the world

666
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,199
is to love someone who doesn't belong to you

667
00:42:36,479 --> 00:42:38,600
Ya Ran, please tell me

668
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:40,399
who is this person
