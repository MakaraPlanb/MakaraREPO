1
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,279
meet again

2
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,759
out of the way

3
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,440
Su G

4
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:24,759
I really underestimate you

5
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,119
A hundred years ago, the Tianluodi net

6
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:28,399
also let you escape

7
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,080
What's more, this little secret room

8
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,399
I haven't seen you in a hundred years

9
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,199
you haven't changed at all

10
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,279
I let you down

11
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,240
I am very happy

12
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,240
So I can kill you with my own hands

13
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,039
then you try

14
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,160
Su G

15
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,919
Another one to die

16
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,520
we are surrounded

17
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,360
I didn't mean to bring you here

18
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,199
wrong

19
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,559
this is not your fault

20
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,759
Qingchen is the bait

21
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,479
Arrest them all and notify the Major General

22
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,199
Yes

23
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:54,399
Xijing

24
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,559
If there is a fight in a while

25
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,320
You protect Na Sheng and go first

26
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,800
Kongsang

27
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,000
Can't kill each other

28
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,720
we don't need to fight

29
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,919
your highness

30
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,639
Nasheng

31
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,160
All Qing soldiers

32
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,920
The little girl was Lizhu, the maid next to Qingjun

33
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,320
centuries

34
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,119
Although our Qing clan

35
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,559
be preserved

36
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,079
But the river has been oppressing us

37
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,519
Now they come to our territory to run wild

38
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,119
King Jiuyi knew it for a long time

39
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,640
But he still let them

40
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:39,200
oppress our people

41
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,399
how about your highness

42
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,239
He is also the king of our Qing clan

43
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,559
How dare you say something so outrageous

44
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,040
King of Qing

45
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,399
presumably everyone

46
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,480
didn't figure it out

47
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,760
he

48
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,959
He is the real king of our Qing clan

49
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,959
That's right

50
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,600
He is the real king of your Qing clan

51
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,679
who is he

52
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,519
He was a hundred years ago

53
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,320
Stand up for Kongsang

54
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,239
New Qingwangyuan who sacrificed himself

55
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:13,720
Isn't it already sacrificed?

56
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,000
Why are you still standing here

57
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:17,679
that is

58
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,559
You think you just push someone out

59
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,279
Said he was His Highness Qingyuan

60
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,359
do i have to believe

61
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,519
who are you

62
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,519
He is Kongsang Crown Prince Zhenlan

63
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:30,000
impossible

64
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:32,160
His Royal Highness Zhenlan as early as a hundred years ago

65
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,679
already dead

66
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:35,519
He really is the prince Zhenlan

67
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,559
from beads

68
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,239
Don't be fooled by these unidentified people

69
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,160
deceived

70
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,359
how do you prove

71
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,959
Su G, you let me go today

72
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:05,160
I can seal Liuhe to you

73
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,079
do you know what i want

74
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,559
i want you to die

75
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,880
Feather magic

76
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,160
A Ying

77
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,279
Are you staring at your uncle

78
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,320
Killed by Su G?

79
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,519
You and I belong to the Kongsang royal family

80
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:25,119
Where is the flesh connected?

81
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:27,359
Do you still care about the flesh and blood?

82
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,440
I know Bai Ying now

83
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,959
You ask him to help you find Liuhe seal

84
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,519
you are using his power

85
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,200
What's the difference between you and me

86
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,200
This is the emperor's holy relic

87
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:49,480
since ancient times

88
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,760
Can only be worn by Prince Kongsang

89
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:53,200
so why

90
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,559
Now in the hands of this girl

91
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,279
This is really the emperor ring

92
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,440
why don't you believe

93
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,600
it's said

94
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,399
Only the power of the emperor can unlock the enchantment

95
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,600
If you can untie

96
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,239
we believe

97
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:07,119
open it, brother prince

98
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:07,839
Nasheng

99
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,880
I once heard King Jiuyi say

100
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,600
This enchantment is based on the mana sealed by Liuhe

101
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,320
to maintain

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The seal is puzzled

103
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,679
Enchantment puzzled

104
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,160
The seal is still in Qingchen's hands

105
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,320
This

106
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,160
Lizhu girl

107
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,880
Don't you help outsiders bluff us

108
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,239
You are a bunch of liars

109
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,239
who said it

110
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,359
I

111
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,519
I just forgot the spell

112
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,200
Prince brother

113
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,480
Prove it to them

114
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,160
What if Kong-san's ancestors appeared?

115
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:45,519
Major General

116
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:46,880
I do not believe

117
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,640
You even have Su G, who only has half mana.

118
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,480
can't beat

119
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,279
Sora mulberry ancestor

120
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
give me divine power

121
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,839
save my people

122
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:14,160
to tell the ancestors

123
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,000
Six Seals

124
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:23,159
This Jiuyi enchantment is broken

125
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:29,200
The cloudless sky is about to change

126
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,520
It seems to open this enchantment

127
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:06,919
should be related to this seal

128
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,880
You are now back in strength

129
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:11,640
Your Highness should also get the power of the emperor.

130
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,760
Lizhu pays homage to His Royal Highness the Prince

131
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,200
Meet the Prince

132
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,320
I really do not live up to my trust

133
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,159
Yuhuan, you want to save me

134
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,400
If I die

135
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:36,080
How do you return to the Lord of the Prey?

136
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,239
I've tried my best to protect you

137
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,400
But Lord Prey

138
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,479
as if from the beginning

139
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,479
I didn't want you to live

140
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:50,599
when necessary

141
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:53,799
King Jiuyi can be eliminated

142
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,400
This is impossible

143
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:57,679
without me

144
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:59,799
How can Lord Prey beat Kong Sang

145
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,000
Cang Liu everything now

146
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,679
My Qing Wangchen has all the credit

147
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:06,960
The prey The prey won't let me die

148
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:08,359
Will not

149
00:11:08,479 --> 00:11:09,479
Who is the prey

150
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,479
why did you betray kong sang

151
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,559
if it weren't for you

152
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:13,919
my father

153
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,760
And Kongsang won't die

154
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,559
prey

155
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,440
Is the master of the cangliu

156
00:11:20,719 --> 00:11:22,080
The man in black robe on the mirror tower

157
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,400
How can you even know who he is?

158
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:27,400
You are no match for him at all

159
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:29,679
The demise of Kongsang

160
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:32,000
It was doomed seven thousand years ago

161
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,919
your mouse eyes

162
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,280
can't see the past

163
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,640
can't see the future

164
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,200
It's you who can't see the future

165
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,799
I Su G never ask the past

166
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,400
there is my place

167
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:52,000
is the future

168
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:05,239
There was a blue light just over there

169
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,960
Bai Ying and Su G

170
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:08,719
should be over there

171
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,159
Xijing

172
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:14,880
You take them down the mountain first

173
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:16,479
you go alone

174
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,760
The barrier is broken

175
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,119
Cangliu people will attack soon

176
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,239
You protect Na Sheng and take them away

177
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:24,960
otherwise

178
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:27,119
I asked Qingyuan to escort Nasheng down the mountain

179
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:28,280
I will go with you

180
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:28,919
no need

181
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,520
Now the seal on my right leg is lifted

182
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,119
half power back

183
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,400
Qingyuan

184
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,320
His light-shielding cloak has a duration

185
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:39,119
I'm here, don't worry

186
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,799
good attention to safety

187
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,919
You should have died a hundred years ago

188
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:05,880
you stupid person

189
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:09,000
You try so hard to help them

190
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,919
Do you know

191
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,400
colorless city

192
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:16,960
cost of reopening

193
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:20,119
Blue dragon

194
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,599
She's going to be wiped out

195
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:33,719
We can't live in the sun

196
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:36,400
When the Colorless City reopens

197
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,479
we will

198
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,200
Bai Ying

199
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,919
what does it mean

200
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:51,719
Of course she dare not tell you

201
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,799
Otherwise you can't work for her

202
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,559
she is like me

203
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,440
is using you

204
00:14:08,359 --> 00:14:09,280
another one

205
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:12,159
His Royal Highness Prince Kongsang

206
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:21,599
Su G, you see clearly

207
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,440
it's them

208
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:29,239
team up to deceive you and take advantage of you

209
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,320
in their hearts

210
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:32,559
Only the 100,000 people of Kongsang

211
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,359
you are nothing

212
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:43,919
what nonsense are you talking about

213
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,679
Last time the colorless city opened

214
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:51,159
The Six Kings Can't Survive in the Sun

215
00:14:51,479 --> 00:14:53,640
Then the next time the colorless city opens

216
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:56,440
The Six Kings should be wiped out

217
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,440
Falling tears on the monument

218
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,080
But do you remember

219
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,039
Bai Ying

220
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,719
Is he telling the truth?

221
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,320
This is the price of colorless city opening

222
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,440
fool

223
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:50,679
This is the fate of you Kongsang and Quanxian

224
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,840
You can't escape

225
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,039
It's His Royal Highness

226
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:59,599
You are the one who enjoys it

227
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,000
a hundred years ago

228
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,239
a hundred years later

229
00:16:10,479 --> 00:16:11,280
you shut up

230
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,440
Su G

231
00:16:53,599 --> 00:16:54,239
Su G

232
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:04,119
I was going to

233
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,959
I'll tell you when it's all over

234
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,959
after you die

235
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,160
I originally

236
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,599
I want to tell you sooner

237
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,640
but you didn't say anything

238
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,439
even a word

239
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,079
We've been through so much together

240
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,119
Isn't it worth telling me about this?

241
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,560
what am i in your heart

242
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,599
after you are drunk

243
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:36,880
why are you telling me that

244
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,000
why do you give me hope

245
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,319
You don't have me at all

246
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,760
you're just using me

247
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:49,800
Su G

248
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:51,760
What kind of person is Ying?

249
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:53,439
you should be clear

250
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,359
even if someone wants to use you

251
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,959
It's definitely not her

252
00:17:57,959 --> 00:17:59,839
That's you, you're using me

253
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:00,680
no

254
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,359
Su G is not

255
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,160
His Royal Highness does not know about this

256
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:46,199
A Ying

257
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:54,359
colorless city opening

258
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:59,439
There's nothing I can do to change the ashes

259
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,880
this is my destiny

260
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,319
Sorry

261
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,760
I want to be alone

262
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,560
General Xijing

263
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm still worried, Your Highness

264
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,640
Let's go back and see

265
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:08,040
no

266
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,079
Your Highness, let me take you down the mountain

267
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:12,520
Nasheng

268
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,640
Yanxi

269
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:16,439
Yanxi

270
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:19,520
Yan Xi Yan Xi

271
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,800
i miss you so much

272
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:21,560
I really

273
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,160
This is still the boundary of Jiuyi Mountain

274
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,880
You will draw the enemy here

275
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:30,760
Yanxi

276
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,160
I really miss you

277
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,439
keep thinking

278
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,280
I want to see you soon

279
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,040
Haven't you seen it now?

280
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,839
I promised you I'd go down the mountain to pick you up

281
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:42,479
didn't i do it

282
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:44,599
you really didn't get it

283
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,199
She was moved, okay?

284
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,599
Yes

285
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,800
do you say

286
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,359
pretty good

287
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,239
Are we going back now?

288
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,520
Still going down the mountain

289
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,000
I met Fei Lian at the foot of the mountain

290
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,760
He should have come for reinforcements.

291
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,640
correct

292
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,560
The seal of the six-in-one seal of the water drop and the heaven sword

293
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,560
did you all get it

294
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,119
if you get

295
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:13,319
leave now

296
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,560
I want to see sister Bai Ying

297
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,119
Brother Ice Cube doesn't seem right today

298
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,400
what's wrong, sir

299
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,239
Prince

300
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,319
Your Highness

301
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,000
how are you alone

302
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:36,680
Your Highness

303
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:42,079
Your Highness

304
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,400
what happens

305
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:47,760
Qingchen is dead

306
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:53,760
Prince brother

307
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,560
What about sister Bai Ying and brother Bingcui?

308
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:07,359
Colorless City opens again

309
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:09,800
The six kings will be wiped out

310
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,479
is that true

311
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,160
tell me

312
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:35,160
is that true

313
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,479
What's the meaning

314
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,199
What's the meaning

315
00:22:57,439 --> 00:22:58,400
uncle uncle

316
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,239
What the prince's brother said was in ashes

317
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:01,119
What's the meaning

318
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,160
That you talk, uncle

319
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:06,400
how is it

320
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:09,160
To save a hundred thousand people

321
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:11,719
Aying and Hongyuan

322
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:13,760
about to open the colorless city again

323
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,040
And the price of opening the colorless city

324
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,800
It's that they are wiped out

325
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,880
no longer resurrect

326
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,599
why don't you tell me

327
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,640
you all know

328
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,160
I don't know

329
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,319
Why

330
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,839
It's the White King who won't let us talk

331
00:24:11,239 --> 00:24:13,000
Then it's not unsealed.

332
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:14,160
Not unsealed

333
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,880
Then if the seal is lifted, everyone will die.

334
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,400
Then what's the point of unsealing it?

335
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,680
We sacrificed half of our lives

336
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,839
Live in a gloomy and colorless city

337
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:23,680
all the meaning

338
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,280
Just let Kong Sang unblock

339
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,760
The pavilion of life and death

340
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,560
We've all been through it once

341
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,640
This time it's not just Bai Ying's sister

342
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:36,479
Even you have to die

343
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:39,000
In order not to make sacrifices meaningless

344
00:24:39,719 --> 00:24:41,040
we gotta keep going

345
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:43,680
maybe this

346
00:24:45,959 --> 00:24:47,400
It's the value paid

347
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:49,400
Your Highness

348
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,920
We didn't mean to hide from you

349
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:53,880
but

350
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,119
all this now

351
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:58,359
all because of me

352
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,520
If it was a hundred years ago

353
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,199
I can use the power of this emperor as soon as possible

354
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:07,800
It won't happen now

355
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:11,719
now

356
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,079
Your Highness

357
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,839
His Royal Highness

358
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:25,800
Cangliu Feilian is about to enter the mountain

359
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:50,640
Little Lord

360
00:25:56,439 --> 00:25:57,400
you wait for me here

361
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,079
The leader told us

362
00:25:59,239 --> 00:26:00,400
let us stay here

363
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:02,160
Said to wait for the enchantment to open

364
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,959
Lord, you will take us home

365
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,839
Yes indeed

366
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:08,959
I'll take you back

367
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:09,839
Very good

368
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:12,520
We have waited seven thousand years to finally go home

369
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,760
But I heard the leader say

370
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,000
send us back

371
00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:18,439
But it will cost you a lot of mana

372
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,280
It doesn't cost anything

373
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:25,839
let all of you go back

374
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,280
is the wish of your leader

375
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,839
It is also the wish of my sea emperor

376
00:26:31,199 --> 00:26:32,199
thank you sir

377
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:35,239
right, chief?

378
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:36,239
where did she go

379
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:39,319
has she gone

380
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:45,359
She's gone one step ahead

381
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,959
This time she said

382
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:50,719
you want to go back alone

383
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,439
But I don't know the way

384
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,359
I'm going to hold her hand

385
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,520
she's waiting for you

386
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,239
take the kids away

387
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,920
Turn them into clouds

388
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,680
rise to the sky

389
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,079
Fall back to the blue sea

390
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,400
i don't want to disappear

391
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:50,920
I want to live longer

392
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,040
because

393
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,119
i want to be with you all the time

394
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,319
If one day I disappear

395
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,479
you can't find it anymore

396
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,640
don't feel sorry for me

397
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:07,719
So you wanted to tell me

398
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:12,000
It turns out that I didn't understand your overtones

399
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,000
Bai Ying

400
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,000
I'm greedy

401
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,959
I crave the care and warmth you give me

402
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,160
that bit by bit

403
00:28:32,439 --> 00:28:34,719
Slowly wearing away my courage to tell the truth

404
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:38,199
When the Air Sea Alliance

405
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:40,800
I'm still complaining that you don't say anything

406
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,839
hide everything from me

407
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,640
But now

408
00:28:46,199 --> 00:28:47,479
it's me

409
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:50,880
Feather magic

410
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,439
Feather magic

411
00:28:59,479 --> 00:29:00,160
Feather magic

412
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,479
Su G

413
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,359
woke up

414
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,520
stand up

415
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:27,719
unknown

416
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,479
I thought you were called my dream lover

417
00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:31,160
come and drink the medicine

418
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,119
It's a fever

419
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,920
You don't even know you have a fever

420
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:42,079
just fell

421
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,680
Thanks

422
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,079
I owe you a pot of aging

423
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:46,680
How much do you owe me

424
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,359
Su G, do you have any news about them?

425
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:52,760
I took your token

426
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:54,079
Called the half-step city's troops

427
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:54,959
search on the mountain

428
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:57,680
They will let us know as soon as they have news

429
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,040
Su G and Zhen Lan took out the Heaven-defying Sword

430
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,680
The barrier of Jiuyi Mountain was also broken by them

431
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,040
Originally there were King Qing and Qing soldiers

432
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,680
can help

433
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,800
nowadays

434
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,359
Death death

435
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,920
Defection

436
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:14,959
so you rest here

437
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,319
I will go to Jiuyi Mountain

438
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,119
They should still be in Jiuyi Mountain

439
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:19,599
Maybe block it

440
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,000
You are not Su G's opponent

441
00:30:24,479 --> 00:30:25,439
you don't believe me

442
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,839
After all, I'm also Major General Cang Liu.

443
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:32,680
Just listen to me and have a good rest here

444
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,959
wait for my good news

445
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,000
Let Fei Lian take the lead and hold them.

446
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:41,359
This can't be tough

447
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:43,479
Looks like a plan

448
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:01,400
Xiang

449
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:03,439
Fei Lian and Yu Huan have not been seen in the military camp recently

450
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,719
where did they go

451
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,119
Jiuyi enchantment was broken

452
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,199
Fei Lian asked you to go to Banbu City for reinforcements

453
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,520
I don't see Yuhuan today

454
00:31:23,959 --> 00:31:26,160
Is he also in Half Step City?

455
00:31:26,439 --> 00:31:28,400
Said to be a covert operation

456
00:31:28,479 --> 00:31:29,479
Then I'll go with you

457
00:31:30,199 --> 00:31:31,160
why go

458
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:35,439
Fei Lian's message to you

459
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,560
I'm in trouble

460
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,359
Xiao

461
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,040
what are you saying

462
00:31:42,439 --> 00:31:44,280
Of course they should die there.

463
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,760
Cang Liu lost two major generals

464
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,079
Wouldn't it be more beneficial for us, Quanxian?

465
00:31:49,719 --> 00:31:51,239
Save Yu Huan and Fei Lian

466
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,760
Always looking for trouble with the young master

467
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,079
Who do you want to support?

468
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:08,760
you to him

469
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,800
how is this possible

470
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,599
I am naturally worried about the safety of the young master

471
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,560
I only remind you when I treat you as my sister

472
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,800
how many companions do we have

473
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,640
The Cang Liu people cast a mind control technique

474
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:22,560
How many companions do we have

475
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,880
Become a plaything of the cangliu

476
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,359
Of course I know

477
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,520
They flow everyone's sword

478
00:32:33,199 --> 00:32:34,400
it's all for us

479
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,439
why are you

480
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,640
Xiao

481
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,479
Feather Magic and Fei Lian

482
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:50,719
Maybe there is a heart of loyalty and retribution

483
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,640
Maybe I can help you

484
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,000
But in the end they are for

485
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,040
I'm just making the best use of you

486
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,680
I will suppress this

487
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,760
I will not support

488
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:11,880
Feather Magic and Fei Lian

489
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:13,599
The two unarmed major generals

490
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:16,119
It's just an abandoned child in the court battle

491
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,160
You decide whether to go or not

492
00:33:20,439 --> 00:33:21,239
I see

493
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:24,400
Do not let me down

494
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,760
Prince Maaran

495
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,599
Are you sure you are the master of them?

496
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:48,760
Did you go this way yesterday?

497
00:33:50,959 --> 00:33:51,640
Prince

498
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,280
sorry

499
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:03,000
They did go this way

500
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,640
His Royal Highness

501
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,199
Didn't you close your eyes last night?

502
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,000
really can't sleep

503
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,520
Lizhu girl

504
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:25,479
Do you know where they're going?

505
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,439
Here is the back mountain

506
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,399
Both the left and right peaks can go up or down.

507
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,040
this is really

508
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,399
your hair

509
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,520
don't panic

510
00:34:49,479 --> 00:34:50,840
It should be the defender of our Qing clan

511
00:34:55,399 --> 00:34:56,760
Miss Lizhu has an accident

512
00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:59,040
Qing Wangjun was found dead in the hall

513
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,639
what

514
00:34:59,919 --> 00:35:01,159
The Cangliu Army has climbed the mountain

515
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:02,919
The Qing's soldiers are currently unmanned

516
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,080
Prince please order

517
00:35:04,919 --> 00:35:05,520
Your Highness

518
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,159
Your Highness

519
00:35:14,399 --> 00:35:15,760
Qingchen and Qingjun are dead

520
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,679
Blue Soldier

521
00:35:18,439 --> 00:35:19,639
They all surrendered to Kong Sang

522
00:35:21,959 --> 00:35:22,560
Qingyuan

523
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,199
Your Highness

524
00:35:24,439 --> 00:35:25,399
King Jiuyi is dead

525
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,719
Do you want to take back your territory?

526
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:28,439
my territory

527
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:29,639
Yes

528
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,639
This Jiuyi Mountain

529
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,280
This is the territory of the Qing clan

530
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:35,199
And you are the king of the Qing clan

531
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,879
Although you were born in the mirror city

532
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,840
never been to this place

533
00:35:40,479 --> 00:35:41,360
But a hundred years ago

534
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:43,760
In order to be able to open the colorless city

535
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,600
Desperate to become the King of Qing

536
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,360
today

537
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,879
if you want

538
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,439
You can take over Jiuyi as King Qing

539
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:55,760
Of course it is easy to recover Jiuyi

540
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,399
But it's not easy to rule this place

541
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,719
if you don't want to

542
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,239
I choose to follow His Highness

543
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:04,479
give up everything for Kongsang

544
00:36:04,879 --> 00:36:06,360
I don't care about these thrones

545
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,679
Since His Royal Highness speaks

546
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,439
Qingyuan will die

547
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,120
Qingyuan is willing to stay in Jiuyi for the rest of her life

548
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,959
Worship ancestors and pray for Kongsang

549
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,719
only

550
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:28,320
you now

551
00:36:28,439 --> 00:36:30,239
Can't walk freely in the sun

552
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,360
perhaps

553
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,679
During the day you can stay in the tomb of King Xingzun

554
00:36:35,959 --> 00:36:37,199
It's that black place

555
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:39,520
It's a way

556
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,719
Qingyuan come here

557
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,600
I fortified your cloak with the power of kings

558
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:57,280
extended its validity

559
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,239
Thank you Your Highness for your trouble

560
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,800
The subordinates stay in Jiuyi

561
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,760
Gotta get things done here

562
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,120
No matter what His Royal Highness commands in the future

563
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,800
The power here will be at your command

564
00:37:08,959 --> 00:37:09,600
good

565
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,159
one more thing

566
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,120
from tomorrow

567
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:19,520
Jiuyi County abolishes all systems that oppress Quanxian

568
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:22,679
Prohibit any sale

569
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:23,959
or

570
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:26,199
forced mermen to do hard labor

571
00:37:26,879 --> 00:37:28,000
Let the mermaid of Jiuyi County

572
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,520
Complete restoration of free identity

573
00:37:32,879 --> 00:37:33,719
Lizhu girl

574
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,679
you're free

575
00:37:37,439 --> 00:37:38,280
leave Jiuyi

576
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,439
go where you want to go

577
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,320
from beads

578
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,040
His Royal Highness Prince Xie

579
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:57,800
from beads

580
00:38:00,919 --> 00:38:02,919
Willing to stay to assist the new King Jiuyi

581
00:38:03,439 --> 00:38:04,080
from beads

582
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:05,159
you

583
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,959
There is not much time left for the Pearl

584
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,159
Since Lizhu has the freedom of choice

585
00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:20,679
from beads

586
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,600
Willing to follow His Royal Highness Qingwang

587
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,919
ok come

588
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,280
just let it here

589
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,840
After becoming the air and sea alliance

590
00:38:48,439 --> 00:38:49,600
The first safe place

591
00:38:57,479 --> 00:38:58,159
Qingyuan

592
00:38:58,399 --> 00:38:59,040
Your Highness

593
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,040
leave it alone

594
00:39:02,399 --> 00:39:03,080
Take care of yourself

595
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,760
Farewell to Your Highness Qingyuan

596
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,280
Farewell to His Royal Highness

597
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:22,800
let's go

598
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,760
His Royal Highness must have made plans for a long time.

599
00:39:37,399 --> 00:39:38,360
Only let Qingyuan come

600
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,760
should also

601
00:39:40,959 --> 00:39:42,000
let him take it back

602
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,800
It belongs to their Qing family.

603
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:46,679
you see him so young

604
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:48,760
never had anything

605
00:39:49,399 --> 00:39:50,439
But it's going to vanish

606
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,320
I let him stay

607
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,199
also want to fulfill him

608
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,520
this life

609
00:39:58,919 --> 00:40:00,000
how to love again

610
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:07,800
thanks

611
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,560
This is what I should do

612
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:13,080
I don't need a maid

613
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,159
You don't have to serve me

614
00:41:18,919 --> 00:41:19,560
Come

615
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:32,399
this half life

616
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:35,000
you are all for freedom

617
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:36,399
leave Jiuyi

618
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,600
I'm afraid to let you stay

619
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,360
unfair to you

620
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:45,479
I was half dead

621
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:48,120
not easy to see

622
00:41:49,959 --> 00:41:50,840
Maybe

623
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,040
I can't walk with you in the woods

624
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,120
I can't accompany you to travel the mountains and rivers

625
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:02,879
Your Highness

626
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:05,719
Lizhu believes freedom

627
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:08,239
not where

628
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,000
but the heart

629
00:42:12,879 --> 00:42:14,159
This is my life

630
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:17,280
Choose for yourself for the first time

631
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,360
I'm only half a lamp in my life

632
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,159
wish for one

633
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:48,120
This is what my mother left me before she died

634
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:50,040
i give it to you

635
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:52,919
Your Highness
