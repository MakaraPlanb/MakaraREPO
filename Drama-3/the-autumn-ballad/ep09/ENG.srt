=Episode 9=

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,559
Here's the Firewood Office's
dressing room.

19
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,720
(Fortune Telling)

20
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:45,519
Song Jin,

21
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,120
pick a couple of costumes.

22
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:53,720
Sir.

23
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,559
Miss Qiu Yan, try this on.

24
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,040
Let me see.

25
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,599
I want a different one.

26
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:08,679
I want this one.

27
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,320
You want me to play a servant boy?

28
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:14,160
You just want to order me around.

29
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,320
Your Lordship wants to reenact the scene
at Heming Building.

30
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,800
Lord Liang, do remember

31
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,679
that we're working together.

32
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:21,360
But Miss Qiu Yan,

33
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,160
you and His Lordship

34
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,919
are going to Wanyan House.

35
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,440
She's right.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,679
It's a joint action.

37
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:28,800
She can dress up anyhow she wants.

38
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,279
Song Jin,

39
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:33,759
stick a mustache on her.

40
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,800
No need. I'll do it myself.

41
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,240
I know how to stick it.

42
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,160
I've watched operas before.

43
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,720
Help yourself, then.

44
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,199
Song Jin, leave her alone.

45
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:46,720
Help me get changed.

46
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,320
Sure.

47
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,639
Song Jin, what do you think?

48
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:11,080
I didn't expect Miss Qiu

49
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,440
to look pretty in men's clothes.

50
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:16,639
Lord Liang.

51
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:19,759
Childish.

52
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,240
You're here.

53
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,119
Did everything go well?

54
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:45,639
He's dead.

55
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:48,039
It's all thanks for your timely notice.

56
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,000
Since he's already dead,

57
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:55,600
shouldn't you honor the promise

58
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,160
you made me before?

59
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,399
I know

60
00:03:58,399 --> 00:04:00,080
you're talking about Miss Shaoyao.

61
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,399
But she can't go with you.

62
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,559
Why?

63
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,679
Because

64
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,679
I never planned to let you live!

65
00:04:13,065 --> 00:04:17,640
(Wanyan House)

66
00:04:19,872 --> 00:04:27,193
(Wanyan House)

67
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,679
Sir, please come in.

68
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:34,279
Come and take a look.

69
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,880
Come in.

70
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,440
What are you doing?

71
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,760
You better remember

72
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,679
that you're a man now.

73
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:04,920
It smells so nice.

74
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:08,200
Why didn't you send anyone
to inform Qin Xuan?

75
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,559
If he knows, he'll get worried

76
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,320
and will come along.

77
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,880
Then the scope of our target
will be wider.

78
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,399
Besides,

79
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,160
I don't want him to take risks for me.

80
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,839
You're thoughtful of him.

81
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,519
Since I'm relying on him,

82
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,040
I can't let him be in danger.

83
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,119
Listen.

84
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,640
After entering Wanyan House,

85
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,679
I won't let you be in any danger

86
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,600
as long as you follow what I say.

87
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:35,079
Song Jin.

88
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:35,600
Yes, my lord.

89
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,359
We'll set six hours as the time limit.

90
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:40,760
If I don't come out by then,
come and get me.

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,679
Yes, my lord.

92
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,320
Have you made up your mind?

93
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,440
Do you really want to go inside?

94
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:51,720
Since we're already here,
so say no more.

95
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,720
Then remember your role

96
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:57,920
and play it to the end.

97
00:05:58,119 --> 00:05:58,959
Of course.

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,279
Sir, come on in.

99
00:06:04,328 --> 00:06:04,969
(Wanyan House)

100
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:07,679
Miss!

101
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,000
Let's go back to the room.

102
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I've caught you.

103
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:44,239
Where do you think
you're running off to?

104
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:45,519
Wait for me!

105
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:49,679
So what do you think?

106
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,000
Do you like it here?

107
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,720
You still have time to leave.

108
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,640
I won't.

109
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:01,160
Hello, Sirs. You must be new here.

110
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:02,799
You don't look familiar at all.

111
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,119
Is this your first time
to Wanyan House?

112
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:08,359
My friend and I are
in the tea business.

113
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,119
We don't always come
to the Capital.

114
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,839
Wanyan House's fame
spreads far and wide.

115
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:13,559
So we came out of admiration.

116
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:15,600
How should I address you, Sirs?

117
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,079
My last name is Song.

118
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:20,200
My friend's last name is Qin.

119
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,640
The reputation of every girl here

120
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:27,839
precedes them.

121
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,920
Every minute spent is precious.

122
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:33,519
Whether it's precious depends

123
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:35,399
after we take a look at them.

124
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:36,519
Of course.

125
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,440
Girls, come on out!

126
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:42,440
We're looking for Miss Shaoyao.

127
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,399
Why didn't you just ask for her?

128
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,679
We're not regular customers here.

129
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:47,799
It'll be too obvious
if we ask for her directly.

130
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,239
So what?

131
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,359
Who's in charge here now?

132
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:53,000
You.

133
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,679
You're a regular.
Of course, I have to go your way.

134
00:07:57,679 --> 00:07:58,440
What are you mumbling about?

135
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,440
Madam, this friend of mine

136
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:45,719
is still a young lad.

137
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,080
He's shy.

138
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,919
Then I'll arrange a girl

139
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,520
who can give great care to Mr. Qin.

140
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,039
He has had a different taste from others
since he was young.

141
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,520
Are there any special ones?

142
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,159
Special ones?

143
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,280
Oh, we do!

144
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,919
Wait, just wait here.

145
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:07,200
- Wait here.
- Thank you, Madam.

146
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,479
You can just do it yourself.

147
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,760
Why did you get me involved?

148
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,359
Behave yourself, Qin.

149
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,640
If you were content with playing
the role of my servant boy,

150
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,880
you wouldn't get a turn in this matter.

151
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,039
But you picked this role,

152
00:09:22,359 --> 00:09:24,039
and we entered as friends.

153
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:26,640
Are you going to be the upright one
and let me be the immoral one?

154
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,000
My name is Xiahe.

155
00:09:43,719 --> 00:09:46,919
Sir, am I soft enough?

156
00:09:48,719 --> 00:09:50,840
Sir, don't go.

157
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:53,440
Pick me.
I'm the most voluptuous one here.

158
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:56,039
Qin, calm down.

159
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,479
You're scaring her.

160
00:09:57,719 --> 00:09:58,679
Pick me.

161
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,840
Help me.

162
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,880
(Please help me.)

163
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,679
- Madam.
- Don't go. Pick me.

164
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:10,080
I get it now.

165
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,359
You're looking down on us
because we're inexperienced.

166
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,320
You don't even bring us the good ones.

167
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,440
Sirs, why do you say that?

168
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,320
Before I came here, my friend told me

169
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,159
that Miss Shaoyao of Wanyan House
was a charming person.

170
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:24,760
Why did you send this type of girl

171
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,880
and not Miss Shaoyao to us?

172
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,000
Shaoyao?

173
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:31,320
You have no taste at all.

174
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:35,640
I don't mean to do that.

175
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,479
Shaoyao made some mistakes previously.

176
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,840
It's against the rule for her
to entertain the guests.

177
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,280
I don't care if it's against the rule.

178
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,640
I must see Shaoyao today.

179
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,320
All right, then.

180
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,559
I'll make the exception
for Mr. Qin today.

181
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,640
Follow me.

182
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,679
Sirs, this way, please.

183
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,359
She pretended to be reluctant

184
00:11:11,359 --> 00:11:12,679
to extort more money.

185
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,239
You were pretty generous there.

186
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,239
You can just get reimbursement
from the public purse.

187
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:17,440
Don't tell me Firewood Office can't afford

188
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,960
to pay for this public spending?

189
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,640
Who says we can claim it
from the public purse?

190
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,719
That was my salary!

191
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,799
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!

192
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:32,840
Madam, have mercy on me!

193
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,799
You're still careless.

194
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,799
You darn girl,

195
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm going to teach you
a lesson after this.

196
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,520
I apologize.

197
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,799
This girl is always this clumsy.

198
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:47,719
Never mind.

199
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,719
I'll help her compensate

200
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,919
for this tea set.

201
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,719
Take this.

202
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,840
Take it. Why aren't you thanking him?

203
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,440
Thank you, Sirs. Thank you, Sirs.

204
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:58,359
Let's go, Madam.

205
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,719
All right.

206
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,760
Sirs, this way, please.

207
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,200
How do you still have money?

208
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,080
Liu, stop cleaning.

209
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,479
Go help out in the front.

210
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:08,159
Yes, Madam.

211
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:09,840
Sirs, this way, please.

212
00:12:22,599 --> 00:12:24,119
Sirs, come in, please.

213
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,320
Greetings, Sirs.

214
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:47,479
You have no idea

215
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:50,679
I've been confined for days.

216
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,000
It's all thanks to you
for getting me out.

217
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:00,559
Qin,

218
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,520
I thought you always try to be funny.

219
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,400
Miss Shaoyao,

220
00:13:06,479 --> 00:13:07,479
no need to rush.

221
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,799
Let's put your clothes back on.

222
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:13,479
My friend is shy by nature.

223
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,200
How about we have a nice talk first?

224
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,280
So you prefer something artistic.

225
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:23,039
I wonder if you want to discuss poetry

226
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:25,039
or enjoy some pleasure of...

227
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,520
Don't you think talking about pleasures

228
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,039
at a brothel is unnecessary?

229
00:13:29,239 --> 00:13:30,520
As for poetry,

230
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,719
don't you think
it'll be even more awkward?

231
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,520
I don't think you spent money here

232
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,280
just to hear me talk
about this city, right?

233
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:44,760
Miss Shaoyao, tell me about yourself.

234
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,280
You're so naughty.

235
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,799
Nothing is interesting about me.

236
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,280
Then have you met

237
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:54,200
some interesting people?

238
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:58,520
What do you mean by interesting guests?

239
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,239
I find both of you to be interesting.

240
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,159
Have you met

241
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:23,400
the ones you find annoying, then?

242
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,200
Let's drink, Sirs.

243
00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:30,760
Never mind about this guy.

244
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,440
Let's enjoy this ourselves.

245
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,200
What a thing to say.

246
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,080
They're all my paying customers.

247
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,799
No matter how ridiculous they behaved,

248
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,200
it's still not that annoying.

249
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,440
If you must mention the annoying ones,

250
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:43,719
I must say it's customers who don't pay.

251
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:46,520
There are such stingy customers?

252
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,359
Can't you decline them?

253
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:51,440
Here.

254
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,239
Madam Chen would chase

255
00:14:55,599 --> 00:14:56,799
these kinds of customers away.

256
00:14:57,359 --> 00:14:58,440
There's only one person

257
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:00,320
who doesn't pay.

258
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:01,840
Yet, I can't refuse him.

259
00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:04,760
It's because
he's Tao Zhugong's subordinate.

260
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,679
Then...

261
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:06,960
Tao Zhugong is...

262
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,960
Wanyan House's owner.

263
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,960
Speaking of Tao Zhugong,

264
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,520
no one has seen his face

265
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:17,080
other than Madam Chen.

266
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:19,479
No one even knows his name.

267
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,280
That's why we called him Tao Zhugong

268
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,479
in private.

269
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:26,039
Your boss sure

270
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,239
is a mysterious person.

271
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,320
I just don't understand

272
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:32,320
why he would hire such
an inferior subordinate.

273
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:35,000
He looks like a refugee fleeing
from famine.

274
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,919
So have you given him

275
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:38,440
anything before?

276
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,640
Why would I give anything
to that kind of person?

277
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,719
But I just remembered

278
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,119
the nameplate I hung at the main hall
a few days ago

279
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,239
went missing once.

280
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,039
Now I think of it,

281
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,479
he must be the one who took it.

282
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,039
Then...

283
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,000
Then

284
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,119
when was the last time he saw you?

285
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,880
Speaking of that,

286
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,119
I ran into him when I came

287
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:07,320
to meet up with you.

288
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:08,719
But he looked like

289
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,239
he was on his way to see Tao Zhugong.

290
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:11,919
Then did he...

291
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:20,599
You don't look like businessmen.

292
00:16:20,719 --> 00:16:23,039
You look like you're
from the government office.

293
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,359
Don't run!

294
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:33,640
I find those two a bit strange.

295
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,200
Watch Shaoyao's room.

296
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,599
Make sure not to cause any trouble.

297
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,919
Yes, Madam.

298
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,640
Other than talking about someone else,

299
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,000
how about doing

300
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,760
something more interesting

301
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,559
with me?

302
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:53,880
Sir, don't be nervous.

303
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:58,679
The incense of Wanyan House
has a powerful aphrodisiac effect.

304
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:02,359
Whether they're a regular

305
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:05,359
or a newcomer to Wanyan House,

306
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,680
I can assure you won't be disappointed

307
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,479
and go home with satisfaction.

308
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,959
You... You have none!

309
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:21,079
Can't you make your move faster?

310
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,400
You don't need to interfere
when I make my move.

311
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,439
She's not waking up after this, right?

312
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,359
Don't worry.

313
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,239
She won't be awake before daybreak.

314
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:40,119
Who's there?

315
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,040
Sirs, Madam Chen instructed me

316
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,359
to send a contraceptive concoction
to Miss Shaoyao.

317
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:46,319
She doesn't want it.

318
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,760
According to Wanyan House's rules,

319
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:50,239
every girl needs to drink this.

320
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:52,760
Sir.

321
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,040
Don't get in my way.

322
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,560
Get lost.

323
00:17:59,719 --> 00:18:00,439
Yes, Sir.

324
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:13,680
It's hot in here.

325
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,040
Madam, I've checked.

326
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,520
There's nothing fishy
about those two new faces.

327
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,599
They're having fun with Shaoyao
at this moment.

328
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,839
Looks like I was oversensitive.

329
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,079
But it's better to be safe than sorry.

330
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:37,000
Receive Official Yao
who's waiting outside,

331
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
and bring him to the backyard.

332
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,640
Yes, Madam.

333
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,560
Have some water.

334
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,160
What's wrong with me?

335
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,040
The fragrance in this room
is too strong.

336
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,520
What were you trying to do to me?

337
00:19:19,719 --> 00:19:21,719
You were the one
who wanted to do something to me.

338
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:23,640
Don't worry.

339
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,239
Even if I have the urge,

340
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:26,400
I won't pick you.

341
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:27,599
Adjust your clothes.

342
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:28,520
We have work to do.

343
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,479
By the way,

344
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:34,719
I won't tell anyone
about what happened just now,

345
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,839
especially Qin Xuan.

346
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:37,680
Thanks but no thanks.

347
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,400
We're here to investigate a case.

348
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,400
Even you tell him, he'll understand.

349
00:19:55,719 --> 00:19:58,920
Since the incense in this room
has such a miraculous effect,

350
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,040
why didn't it work on you?

351
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,719
I've learned martial arts
since I was young.

352
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:05,199
How can I be compared
with ordinary people?

353
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:11,439
I thought you were suffering
from an unspeakable disease.

354
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,040
I dare you to say that again.

355
00:20:13,719 --> 00:20:14,560
I was just kidding.

356
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,920
If Shaoyao is telling the truth,

357
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:24,160
the old man who monitored Xiao Tie
is Tao Zhugong's subordinate.

358
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,079
Then Tao Zhugong

359
00:20:26,199 --> 00:20:28,479
is likely the main culprit
in printing the fake notes.

360
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:32,439
Then Wanyan House

361
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:35,119
is a cover.

362
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:38,000
So it's convenient for the officials
and nobles to buy fake notes.

363
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,680
This is only our presumption.

364
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,119
Next, we need to catch them red-handed.

365
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,199
Since this is where they exchange
the fake notes,

366
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:45,359
there must be a warehouse too.

367
00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:48,880
Xiao Tie's murderer must be here, then.

368
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:49,680
Wait.

369
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:55,800
You've made many mistakes
the moment you entered Wanyan House.

370
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:58,959
If you didn't rush to spend
a lot of money to see Shaoyao,

371
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:00,560
Chen wouldn't be suspicious

372
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,079
to send someone to check on us.

373
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,000
It's my first time to a place like this.

374
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:06,119
I don't have any experience.

375
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,800
But nothing went wrong.

376
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,800
The criminals couldn't care less
about your experience.

377
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:13,880
If you want to continue
the investigation with me,

378
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,119
you must follow my orders.

379
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:19,839
If you want me to follow your orders,

380
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,599
you must be reasonable first.

381
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:29,359
Drink slowly.

382
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,599
Come here.

383
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:31,959
Pour it.

384
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,000
Have you seen Chen?

385
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,680
It's the attendant.

386
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,239
What is it?

387
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,719
I know that person.

388
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:02,599
He's the administrative clerk
from the Council of State.

389
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,640
Come on.

390
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,520
Let's follow him.

391
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,920
Madam, Official Yao has arrived.

392
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,359
Official Yao, it's been a while.

393
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,880
Madam Chen, how are you?

394
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,839
Go back and watch the brothel.

395
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,439
Yes, Madam.

396
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:35,880
I have cash notes worth 500 taels

397
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:37,839
for 15 pieces of yours.

398
00:22:37,853 --> 00:22:38,988
(Ding Rong Banknotes, 100 taels)

399
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,599
Official Yao, this won't do.

400
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:44,880
You should know Wanyan House's rules.

401
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:47,199
First, we don't accept cash
because it's hard to transfer.

402
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,439
Second, we don't accept cash notes
because it's hard to keep.

403
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:53,040
You should bring something more decent.

404
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,839
This is our Yao family's heirloom.

405
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,319
If it's put out in the market,

406
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,959
its value is no less than 800 taels.

407
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,119
Madam Chen, stay. I know the way out.

408
00:24:31,439 --> 00:24:32,079
This is it.

409
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,439
Let's go back and inform Song Jin

410
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,680
and shut Wanyan House down immediately.

411
00:24:36,199 --> 00:24:36,800
We mustn't.

412
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,599
With only these few fake notes,

413
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:40,920
if they deny it until the end

414
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,839
or be killed like Xiao Tie,

415
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:44,520
they'll only be charged

416
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,079
with circulating fake notes at most.

417
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,040
So you want to find Tao Zhugong first?

418
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,199
Why do you think
I come here in person, then?

419
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,160
To catch small fry?

420
00:24:58,359 --> 00:24:59,760
If you ask me,

421
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:01,400
since there's a secret passage,

422
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,520
we should let Song Jin confiscate it
before doing anything.

423
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:05,319
After all, it's too risky

424
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:06,400
with just the two of us.

425
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,680
Do you still want to investigate?

426
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:47,160
Why are you holding to me so tightly?

427
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:48,560
It's too dark. I can't see.

428
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:50,199
You're scared, right?

429
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:52,959
You're the only one who knows
what the murderer looks like.

430
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:54,920
If we want to capture the murderer,

431
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,239
we must bring you along.

432
00:25:56,239 --> 00:25:57,160
You said that yourself.

433
00:25:59,439 --> 00:26:00,160
Let go of me.

434
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:02,479
You're so annoying.

435
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,680
I had no idea

436
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,959
there's such a maze

437
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,400
under Wanyan House.

438
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,800
This must be a cavern

439
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,439
naturally formed underground.

440
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,439
That's why the route
is not straight and complex.

441
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:34,199
Tao Zhugong probably picked

442
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:35,439
this cavern

443
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:38,199
and built Wanyan House above it.

444
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,040
You're pretty smart

445
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,839
to get yourself a candle.

446
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,160
Do you think

447
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,319
you can handle this place without me?

448
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:57,880
What?

449
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:10,160
We're already here.
No need to act anymore.

450
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,280
How overconfident can you be?

451
00:27:20,199 --> 00:27:20,880
Let's go.

452
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,160
A... A dead body.

453
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,880
It's him?

454
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,479
The old back alley rogue.

455
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,839
He was silenced like Xiao Tie.

456
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,800
Looks like the assassin is here.

457
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:18,479
Follow me.

458
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,319
We have less than 200 pieces left.

459
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:54,880
The Duke and Minister Lv

460
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,880
will send their men over here tonight.

461
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:57,319
We should be able to sell all of it.

462
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,359
Good. After tonight,

463
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:02,599
destroy everything here.
Leave nothing behind.

464
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,199
I think those lads

465
00:29:06,213 --> 00:29:06,511
(Yao)

466
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,319
from Firewood Office would find

467
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:10,199
this place in a few days.

468
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:12,400
What about the corpse?

469
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,079
Do I need to teach you again?

470
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:19,640
Tao Zhugong, calm down.
I'll take care of it.

471
00:29:20,096 --> 00:29:21,307
(Cao. Jia. Zhao. Yao)

472
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,079
As for these boxes,

473
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:25,239
you don't have to worry about them.

474
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:27,800
I'll send some men over

475
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,319
to move these boxes out tomorrow night.

476
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:30,959
By the way,

477
00:29:31,719 --> 00:29:34,520
tell the girls to leave
the day after tomorrow.

478
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,920
Just tell them

479
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,880
that Tao Zhugong has left the city

480
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:40,439
and headed down south
a couple of days ago.

481
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,319
If the girls know,

482
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,199
those from Firewood Office
will know too.

483
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,719
I'd like to see where those
from Firewood Office

484
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:51,719
can capture a "Tao Zhugong" down south.

485
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:54,239
That person must be Tao Zhugong.

486
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,439
They wouldn't have expected

487
00:29:57,959 --> 00:30:00,079
that we were already at Wanyan House.

488
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:04,040
These three look like martial artists.

489
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,400
See

490
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,079
if the assassin is one of them.

491
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,239
I

492
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,680
can't see clearly.

493
00:30:19,439 --> 00:30:20,000
Who's there?

494
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:20,800
Run.

495
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:32,800
Hide.

496
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:40,000
Call for help!

497
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:40,920
All right.

498
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,359
Don't think about running.

499
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,439
Come back to Firewood Office with us.

500
00:31:08,439 --> 00:31:09,000
Liang Yi!

501
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:10,000
Qiu Yan, come on!

502
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:16,599
Wait for me.

503
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,079
I'll go this way.

504
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:36,040
Come back here.

505
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:17,000
Wait a minute.

506
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,560
Didn't we use this way just now?

507
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,839
Looks like we went in circles.

508
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,880
Let's try this way.

509
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,359
The man who hid the crossbow just now

510
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,479
must be the man
who assassinated Xiao Tie.

511
00:32:36,199 --> 00:32:37,560
Yet, you didn't recognize him.

512
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:41,119
It was a dangerous situation

513
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,040
and too dim for me to see clearly.

514
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,160
Qiu Yan, I'll ask you one more time.

515
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,760
Did you see the assassin's face?

516
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,040
Fine.

517
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,479
I admit.

518
00:33:03,719 --> 00:33:05,280
I lied to you.

519
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,640
But if I didn't lie to you,

520
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,319
you wouldn't bring me along
for the investigation.

521
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,000
No wonder you didn't want
to come down with me.

522
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:14,400
It wasn't because you were scared.

523
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,920
You were worried your lies
would be exposed.

524
00:33:16,239 --> 00:33:18,199
Qiu Yan, do you know

525
00:33:18,439 --> 00:33:21,040
what's the crime is for obstructing
Firewood Office's investigation?

526
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,760
I did lie to you.

527
00:33:25,199 --> 00:33:26,839
But didn't you lie to me

528
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:27,839
for your own purpose too?

529
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,719
If you want to judge,

530
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:33,079
we're both

531
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,959
the same.

532
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:38,079
Do you really think

533
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:38,880
I'll go easy on you

534
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,319
no matter how ridiculous you behaved
because of Qin Xuan?

535
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:43,479
All right. Then kill me now.

536
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,479
There's no one else
in this dark tunnel anyway.

537
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,160
You can just tell everyone

538
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,319
that I was killed by the bad guys.

539
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:51,640
All right.

540
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:52,839
If you act willfully again,

541
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:54,040
I'm going to ignore you.

542
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,800
Have you forgotten what I said
at the entrance just now?

543
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,320
There's something odd about this paper.

544
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,439
I'd be a fool to believe you again.

545
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,600
What's wrong with you?

546
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,159
I'm not lying this time.

547
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,040
There's an odd smell on these papers.

548
00:34:54,479 --> 00:34:55,199
You can smell it.

549
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,959
This is the smell of Hongzhen Sect's
Incense of Worship.

550
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,639
Hongzhen Sect?

551
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:21,520
The smell may be faint.

552
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:24,120
But the smell will be covered
when it meets ink.

553
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,159
The smell of Incense of Worship is unique.

554
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,040
There's no mistake.

555
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,080
In that case,

556
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,800
the Ministry of Revenue is not
the only one supplying the fake notes.

557
00:35:37,919 --> 00:35:40,040
Hongzhen Sect may be involved in this too.

558
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:42,000
This case is far more complicated

559
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,320
than I'd imagined.

560
00:35:47,399 --> 00:35:48,040
Let me check

561
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,239
to see if there are other clues.

562
00:35:56,959 --> 00:35:58,280
You?

563
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,239
Are you working for Tao Zhugong?

564
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:03,159
No! I'm not!

565
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:04,520
Sirs, you've got it all wrong.

566
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:06,199
Why are you here?

567
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,040
I...

568
00:36:08,439 --> 00:36:08,919
Speak.

569
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:10,439
I'm here to steal the cash notes.

570
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:12,840
Why?

571
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,239
I'm Ping'er.

572
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:17,600
My father and I work at Wanyan House.

573
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,479
He works as a porter at the gatehouse.

574
00:36:19,525 --> 00:36:20,987
(Wanyan House)

575
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:21,600
Father.

576
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,719
Liu, stop cleaning.

577
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,000
Go help out in the front.

578
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:25,719
Yes, Madam.

579
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:27,360
Sirs, this way, please.

580
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:31,719
My father has always been in poor health.

581
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,159
He needs medicine to nurse his health.

582
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,520
But our monthly wages

583
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,800
are only several coins.

584
00:36:36,399 --> 00:36:37,879
So I can only take the risk

585
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:40,399
to sell the things I stole.

586
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,159
How did you end up stealing
from this place?

587
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:46,439
At first, I stole from the customers.

588
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,639
Then I start stealing from Madam Chen.

589
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:50,479
I found this place by accident.

590
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:51,639
So I'd come in here to steal

591
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,439
a few fake notes every few days.

592
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,199
They didn't notice anything until now

593
00:36:55,399 --> 00:36:57,159
because I only stole
one or two fake notes at a time.

594
00:36:58,439 --> 00:36:59,120
Sirs, please spare me

595
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,879
for the sake of me being filial

596
00:37:00,879 --> 00:37:01,760
to my father.

597
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,040
If I go to prison,

598
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:05,760
my father won't live anymore.

599
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,040
That makes sense.

600
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,239
Come, get up and talk to us.

601
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:13,719
All right. Since you said,

602
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,840
you came here many times.

603
00:37:14,919 --> 00:37:16,560
So you must be familiar
with the tunnels here.

604
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,520
So do you know

605
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:19,239
where's is the other exit of the tunnel?

606
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,600
I think so.

607
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,639
I've never been there.

608
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,120
Tell me, and I'll let you go.

609
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:34,360
Watch your steps.

610
00:37:58,439 --> 00:37:59,199
It's right here.

611
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,000
Please come with me.

612
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:42,040
Looks like you're right.

613
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:44,280
Hongzhen Sect is indeed involved.

614
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:47,959
This is bad.

615
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:48,600
What?

616
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,800
This is the Imperial Park.

617
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,560
Imperial Park?

618
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,600
His Majesty cultivates to be immortal,
reveres the Grand Preceptor.

619
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:57,239
So His Majesty bestowed a piece of land
in the suburb of the Capital city

620
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:59,239
to build Hongzhen Holy Palace.

621
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,399
Besides His Majesty
and the Masters of Hongzhen Sect,

622
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,560
outsiders are forbidden to enter.

623
00:39:02,879 --> 00:39:04,320
That's why it's called the Imperial Park.

624
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:06,439
I came here once for a ritual
with His Majesty last year.

625
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:08,719
In that case,

626
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:11,479
the one behind Tao Zhugong

627
00:39:11,959 --> 00:39:13,320
is the Grand Preceptor himself.

628
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,280
If that's the case,

629
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,760
this is a shocking case
that can shake the country's foundation.

630
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,360
We can't stay here.

631
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,399
We must leave now.

632
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:22,320
Who's there?

633
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,360
Liang Yi from Firewood Office requests
an audience with the Grand Preceptor.

634
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,040
Based on what you said,

635
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,520
Wanyan House's tunnel leads directly
to the Imperial Park.

636
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,560
Yes.

637
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:47,560
If I wasn't after the villain,

638
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,280
I wouldn't have dared to break into
the Imperial Park

639
00:39:49,399 --> 00:39:50,479
and cause a disturbance to you.

640
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,919
I hope you can lift the restriction here

641
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:54,679
and let the Firewood Office
search the place.

642
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,280
Outrageous! The Imperial Park
is a holy place of the Hongzhen Sect.

643
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,439
If you use force to solve this,

644
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,159
it'll definitely anger the heavens,
and wrath will be upon us!

645
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,520
Stop trying to trick us
with the so-called wrath from heaven.

646
00:40:02,879 --> 00:40:04,199
You're clearly afraid that this scandal

647
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:05,399
will be exposed to everyone.

648
00:40:06,439 --> 00:40:08,280
How dare you.
Apologize to the Grand Preceptor now.

649
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,679
Please don't take this to heart.
I failed to teach her well.

650
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:14,959
I know very well

651
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:16,360
that you're not involved in this matter.

652
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,800
I'm just worried that your disciple
may do this behind your back.

653
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:22,399
If it's because
several ungrateful disciples

654
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,399
affect His Majesty's trust in you,

655
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:27,000
I'll find it unfair to you.

656
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,399
Miss, get up first.

657
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:37,239
Lord Liang, stop putting an act.

658
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,000
If someone from Hongzhen Sect does evil,

659
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,199
I'll never tolerate it if I find out.

660
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,560
I'm afraid

661
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:46,919
someone deliberately plants evidence
to set me up.

662
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,760
I truly admire your righteousness.

663
00:40:50,399 --> 00:40:52,879
If you do the investigation yourself,

664
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,560
you'll be said to harbor the villains

665
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:57,959
no matter the outcome.

666
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:00,520
Lord Liang, are you doubting me?

667
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:01,399
I dare not.

668
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,040
It's simple if you want
to convince the public.

669
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:06,760
The suspect who escaped here
is injured in the leg.

670
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,879
If you gather everyone
from the Imperial Park

671
00:41:08,959 --> 00:41:10,760
and let us check one by one,

672
00:41:10,879 --> 00:41:12,399
you can prove Hongzhen Sect's
innocence then.

673
00:41:12,399 --> 00:41:12,959
What a joke.

674
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,520
Why do I need to prove our innocence
to Firewood Office?

675
00:41:16,399 --> 00:41:18,040
What if the Firewood Office insists
on investigating?

676
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:19,439
Then I can only report to His Majesty

677
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,479
that you broke
into the Imperial Park with motives.

678
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,320
Then we'll let His Majesty
make a choice between you and me.

679
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,840
Master, I saw Xuanjing looking flustered

680
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,919
and going into the meditation room

681
00:41:30,439 --> 00:41:32,159
with injury while patrolling.

682
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,560
I asked him about it,

683
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,800
but he didn't answer me.

684
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:36,479
I saw him acting suspiciously.

685
00:41:36,479 --> 00:41:36,879
Who's this?

686
00:41:36,879 --> 00:41:38,000
So I took him here to see you.

687
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:40,520
He's the head of Hongzhen Sect,
Lingzheng.

688
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,520
The second person
under the Grand Preceptor.

689
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:43,959
Bring him here.

690
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,879
He's the one we were after.

691
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:57,959
Xuanjing,

692
00:41:58,879 --> 00:41:59,719
are you really involved

693
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:01,239
in the fake notes business
at Wanyan House?

694
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,360
I'll take responsibility for what I did.

695
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,760
You can punish me
according to the sect's regulations.

696
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,479
How dare you do such a shameful thing?

697
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,560
How do you want me
to face His Majesty in the future?

698
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,360
Grand Preceptor, calm down.

699
00:42:14,959 --> 00:42:16,159
There are many disciples
in Hongzhen Sect.

700
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,800
It's hard to say
there are no bad apples.

701
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,719
I'm sure His Majesty won't blame you.

702
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:21,600
I have no intention
to publicize this case either.

703
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:25,239
I only need to bring
the suspect back to Firewood Office

704
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:26,320
for questioning.

705
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,000
Lord Liang, you're truly transparent
in handling things.

706
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:32,800
Lingzheng,

707
00:42:33,959 --> 00:42:36,520
hand Xuanjing to Lord Liang.

708
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:45,199
Grand Preceptor,
I'll take my leave, then.

709
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:55,600
What...

710
00:42:59,399 --> 00:43:00,959
Lord Liang, you're truly skilled.

711
00:43:01,479 --> 00:43:02,360
If I don't use some tricks,

712
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,879
how can I easily have you under control?

713
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,639
Looks like you're the mastermind.

714
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,479
Lord Liang, your deduction is right.

715
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,280
You solve cases with great speed.

716
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,360
However,

717
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:28,520
I never expected

718
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,239
that you'd force me

719
00:43:30,879 --> 00:43:33,159
to do it myself!

720
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,560
Lingzheng,

721
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,439
are you out of your mind?

722
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,840
How dare you point your sword at me?

723
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Shut your damn mouth!

724
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,280
Master, you focus on cultivation
with all your heart and soul

725
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:48,320
that you didn't know Imperial Park
has fallen into my hands.

726
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:52,000
The current emperor is nearing his end.

727
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:54,120
How many years more
he can still dote on you?

728
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
When the Crown Prince
succeeds the throne,

729
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:00,159
Hongzhen Sect will be the first
he comes after!

730
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,360
The fake notes business

731
00:44:03,959 --> 00:44:05,879
is to bribe the Crown Prince's
trusted follower

732
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,439
to give leeway to Hongzhen Sect.

733
00:44:18,919 --> 00:44:20,199
What's so funny, Lord Liang?

734
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,800
I laughed because you
have a well-devised plan.

735
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,280
But if the Grand Preceptor and I

736
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:28,919
die at the Imperial Park together,

737
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,360
how will you explain it to His Majesty?

738
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,000
You're right about that, Lord Liang.

739
00:44:36,679 --> 00:44:38,800
You're the emperor's favorite now.

740
00:44:40,399 --> 00:44:42,840
If things didn't come to this point,

741
00:44:43,879 --> 00:44:45,239
I didn't have to do this.

742
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,320
How about you end him for me

743
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,760
and put the fake notes business on him.

744
00:44:53,479 --> 00:44:54,760
When I become the Grand Preceptor,

745
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,040
I'll definitely repay you.

746
00:44:58,639 --> 00:44:59,959
You underestimate me too much.

747
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,639
Why should I listen to you?

748
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,040
Of course, you won't listen to me.

749
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,760
Then your beautiful friend

750
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:15,040
will have to die here today.

751
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:34,159
Fine.

752
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,399
Give me one night.

753
00:45:39,399 --> 00:45:40,639
