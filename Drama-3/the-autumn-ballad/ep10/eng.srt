=Episode 10=

18
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,400
Liang Yi.

19
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:42,959
It's too stuffy.

20
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,120
Stay still.

21
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:50,760
It's suffocating.

22
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,559
Are you okay?

23
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,599
What about me?

24
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,559
Calm down.

25
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,000
Turn over.

26
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,160
I live comfortably for several decades

27
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:20,039
and now, this is my end.

28
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:22,800
How unjust!

29
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:24,839
Seriously though,

30
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,639
is there a secret passage here?

31
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,839
This is my Chinese alchemy room.

32
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:28,679
There's no secret passage whatsoever.

33
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,559
Stop fiddling around.

34
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,440
There's only one exit

35
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:34,520
and it can only be opened
by the entrance.

36
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,240
I didn't know they would do this to me.

37
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,160
You have no idea.

38
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,360
I spend a long time
concocting pills here.

39
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,479
I am utterly devoted

40
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,960
to His Majesty's health.

41
00:02:44,119 --> 00:02:45,759
Now that they left me here,

42
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,800
they should be called mentor killers,

43
00:02:48,119 --> 00:02:49,320
they should be viewed as lowly scums.

44
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,520
Lingzheng, you ingrate!

45
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,199
I curse you!

46
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:00,399
He looks educated but is actually
a simpleton.

47
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,279
Your arm.

48
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:07,199
It's fine.

49
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:10,919
What are you doing?

50
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,360
You're injured because of me.
I should take care of your wound.

51
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,759
It's only right.

52
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,440
Don't.

53
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,880
Don't move.

54
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:20,479
Didn't you say

55
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:21,679
that I'm one of your own?

56
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,679
Excuse me.

57
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,720
Since we're all stuck down here anyway,

58
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,080
would you care to drink with me?

59
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:46,240
No thanks.

60
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:47,880
Great.

61
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,839
What should we do?

62
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,960
Are we really stuck here forever?

63
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,839
Didn't you hear
what the Grand Preceptor said?

64
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:03,479
There's no other exit.

65
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:06,839
And you'll give up like that?

66
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,320
Let's brainstorm then.

67
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,679
What are you doing, Miss?

68
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,359
It's just a stone wall,

69
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:31,880
not a metal wall.

70
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,600
We can dig our way out.

71
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:35,600
But the wall is thick.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,440
When a woman like you finishes digging,

73
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,679
we'll be already dead from starvation.

74
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:40,600
Better than being sitting ducks.

75
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,040
Excuse me.

76
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,519
When will Lord Liang return?

77
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,239
Mr. Qin. I will inform you
once Lord Liang returns.

78
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,480
If you can't stay here,

79
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,640
you can return home first.

80
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,640
Where did he bring Qiu Yan to?

81
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,600
I have no news whatsoever.
How can I return home like this?

82
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,440
Where's Song Jin? Bring me to Song Jin.

83
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,920
Freeze!

84
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,279
Sir, you're...

85
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,679
I'm from the Firewood Office.

86
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,720
Where's the Head here?

87
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,160
I have been looking for her too.

88
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,119
Sir Jin, I have searched everywhere.

89
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:47,959
No trace of Lord Liang and Miss Qiu Yan.

90
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,040
Check if there's any secret passage.

91
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,239
Now!

92
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,519
Yes, sir.

93
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:03,720
Stop digging.

94
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:05,799
You'll exhaust yourself to death.

95
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,480
I wiggled out

96
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,480
of He Feng's death trap.

97
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,119
Before I can even enjoy my freedom,

98
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,799
I have to meet my end
in another death trap?

99
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:15,760
No way.

100
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:19,359
Life and death are just
a matter of seconds.

101
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,000
You don't have a say in it.

102
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,720
When the Yamla comes for your soul,

103
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,920
your consent is none of his concern.

104
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:26,799
Please, no need to be so nonchalant.

105
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:28,760
Are you willing to die here

106
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,000
for your fake notes investigation?

107
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,359
This is my job.

108
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:33,799
If my journey ends here,
it ends at the right place.

109
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,359
I won't accept this.

110
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:37,320
I haven't had a good day before.

111
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,959
Why should I die here?

112
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,440
Ever since I left the He Residence,

113
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,799
I told myself that now that I survived,

114
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,799
I had to live every day to the fullest.

115
00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:47,079
I want to show those who wish me death

116
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:50,359
how well I am enjoying my life now.

117
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,559
My life

118
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,239
is more tenacious than they imagined.

119
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:56,920
If you didn't lie to me,

120
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,799
you wouldn't end up like this.

121
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:01,559
Is Qin Xuan worth

122
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:02,640
the trouble?

123
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:05,519
You think I did everything

124
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:07,160
to marry Qin Xuan?

125
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,959
Instead of being married
to someone else,

126
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,000
I want to walk my own path.

127
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,799
I don't want anyone
to tell me what to do.

128
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,040
If you can get out of here
and do whatever you want,

129
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,720
what will you do?

130
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,079
I heard many stories

131
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,160
about dead women who were falsely
accused in their household.

132
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,239
I want to right their names.

133
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,200
I will jot down their stories
and publish a compilation

134
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:36,000
to warn future women.

135
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,279
You live most of your life
in the comfort of your house.

136
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,799
Why are you so interested
in strange cases?

137
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,279
When I was little, I was illiterate

138
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,160
but I wanted to read.

139
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,359
To indulge me,

140
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,600
my mother let me read stories
of criminal cases.

141
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:52,640
The first book I read
was an incomplete hand-written copy.

142
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,839
I think it's called
Collection of Odd Occurrences.

143
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,679
I was kept in my house

144
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:01,600
but my mind followed the law enforcer
in the book.

145
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,920
We solved cases, revealed the truth,

146
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,839
punished the evil,
and restored peace together.

147
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,200
Thanks to that incomplete book,

148
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,920
I learned to recognize characters.

149
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:14,040
So you want to be a law enforcer.

150
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:16,880
Fine, I'll pray for you

151
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,279
so that the God

152
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,440
will make you into a man
in your next life.

153
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,239
No, I'm fine with being a woman.

154
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,559
I believe one day,

155
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,160
men and women will be equal.

156
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,839
We can study,
work as government officials,

157
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,200
open business or shop,

158
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,880
or do whatever we want.

159
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:33,119
Even though this probably won't happen
in my lifetime,

160
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:34,400
for my next life or the life after that,

161
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,599
I still want to be a woman

162
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,039
and watch it happen with my eyes.

163
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,559
No rebuttal from you today?

164
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,000
That's not like you at all.

165
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,000
Let those who are about to die

166
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:53,080
say their piece.

167
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,760
What about you?

168
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,080
What do you want to do?

169
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:03,000
I don't think

170
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,919
you're content doing
the government's bidding all your life.

171
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:13,719
Song Jin.

172
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,760
When I grow up,
my brush will be my sword.

173
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,520
I will use my brush

174
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:22,039
to detail all the injustice
in this world.

175
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,359
I will rid all evil and maintain peace.

176
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,080
Just like my father.

177
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,799
(Do not hold grudges again anyone else.)

178
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:39,599
(I just want you
to lead a peaceful life.)

179
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:41,840
This is the last thing
the Marquis left you.

180
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:47,679
His letter does not mean anything to me.

181
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,119
I cannot forgive

182
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,039
nor do I plan to.

183
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:58,479
As I said,

184
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:01,679
my duty lies with the Firewood Office.

185
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,200
It's just a way for me to achieve
great success.

186
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,280
That's all.

187
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,440
When you said you wanted
to leave the Imperial Park,

188
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:11,960
I thought you were afraid
of the powerful

189
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,080
like you were dealing
with the case of He family.

190
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,039
But now, you would rather die here

191
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:18,440
than concede to Lingzheng.

192
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:20,559
That means even though
you're a clout-chaser,

193
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,479
you still have your own principles.

194
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:34,919
What?

195
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:37,599
If you're too exhausted to run later,

196
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
don't blame me for leaving you here.

197
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,479
You found a way out?

198
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:44,960
This is sulfur.

199
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:48,760
It's as heavy as the weight.

200
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,239
Niter.

201
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,039
Carbon powder.

202
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,679
Your way out is pill concoction?

203
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,000
If you combine the three of them

204
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,760
on a specific ratio,

205
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,840
you get what we call, black powder.

206
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:14,080
Follow me.

207
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:23,440
Touch this wall.

208
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,359
It's cold.

209
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:29,840
Behind it is the sacred lake
of the Imperial Park.

210
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:31,799
Judging from the route they took

211
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,400
to send us to this Chinese alchemy room,

212
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,239
we are actually closer
to the sacred lake now.

213
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:38,039
This cold wall confirms my hypothesis.

214
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,960
And judging from its temperature,

215
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,400
the wall isn't very thick.

216
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,239
If we can make a hole here,

217
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:45,679
the lake water
will burst this wall down.

218
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:49,640
But we don't have a fuse.

219
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,640
If we detonate the bomb
in close quarter,

220
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,919
it will backfire.

221
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:55,400
What should we do then?

222
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,080
I have a solution.

223
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,320
What's up?

224
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,919
- Go. Go. Hurry.
- Are we

225
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:31,960
in hell now?

226
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,760
If you don't sober up now, you will be.

227
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,159
I...

228
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,960
I'm doomed anyway.

229
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,400
Save some for me, at least.

230
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,760
Chinese alchemy room.

231
00:13:36,239 --> 00:13:37,039
Follow me!

232
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,380
(Guangmei Hall)

233
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,719
You two, stay here. The rest, follow me.

234
00:13:40,869 --> 00:13:41,541
(Guangmei Hall)

235
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:42,239
Hurry!

236
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,520
Come.

237
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:00,919
Are you okay?

238
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:12,640
Do not tell anyone

239
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,400
what happened just now.

240
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,760
What?

241
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,159
Don't you have faith in your Qin Xuan?

242
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:24,960
This is different. It's...

243
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:25,880
It's...

244
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,559
Come on. I saved you.

245
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,840
I owe you my life.

246
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:32,719
I will repay you in the future.

247
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:35,400
All right.

248
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,640
Let's go.

249
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:40,559
What's this?

250
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,400
Golden handcuffs
given by the Tocharians.

251
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,039
The only pair in the world.

252
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:48,599
Do you have the key? Open it.

253
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,119
I don't mean to bother

254
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:58,280
but I see someone armed coming here.

255
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,599
What should we do?

256
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,640
They are over there. After them!

257
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:03,559
Run!

258
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:05,160
Stand there!

259
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:06,839
Stand there!

260
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,119
Stand there!

261
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,119
Run!

262
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,119
Stand there!

263
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,680
Stand there!

264
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,079
The key fell into the water.

265
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,640
No time for that. Just run.

266
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:18,920
Stand there!

267
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,239
Stand there!

268
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,640
Don't run.

269
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,040
Stand there!

270
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:31,040
Run.

271
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,719
Hurry up.

272
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,719
Stand there!

273
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:39,520
Don't let them escape!

274
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,319
Stand there!

275
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,839
- Stay there.
- Don't run.

276
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:43,560
Hurry.

277
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:45,160
Stand there!

278
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:46,239
This way.

279
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:47,839
Don't run. Capture them!

280
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:54,760
Run.

281
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:56,119
Capture them.

282
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:03,439
Stay still.

283
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:58,920
Darn you!

284
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,880
Lingzheng. Xuanjing.

285
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:04,680
You traitors.

286
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:08,640
You deceived your mentor.
You're inhumane.

287
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:11,119
Have you no fear of God's wrath?

288
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:13,199
Hurry.

289
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,520
Is your leg okay?

290
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,959
You kicked me. Run.

291
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,800
Quick.

292
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,040
How quickly can they come here?

293
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:47,560
Soon.

294
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:50,439
Look at this, you two.

295
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,199
Lord Liang

296
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,920
is summoning backup now.

297
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,839
Don't you want to kill us?

298
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:58,280
We will wait for you here.

299
00:19:58,599 --> 00:19:59,800
Come kill us if you can.

300
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:01,199
Come kill me.

301
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,719
They are gone.

302
00:20:16,439 --> 00:20:18,199
We didn't find anyone, sir.

303
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:20,280
We didn't find anyone, sir.

304
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:20,920
We didn't find anyone, sir.

305
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,920
How can two living beings
disappear just like that?

306
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:24,959
Sir, someone saw the red signal.

307
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:26,520
Northwest from here. 20 li away.

308
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,880
All of you, come with me.

309
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:28,680
Come.

310
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:31,400
Gather everyone.

311
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,199
Yes, sir.

312
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:35,959
Are Liang Yi and Qiu Yan in danger?

313
00:20:36,439 --> 00:20:37,079
Yes.

314
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:38,040
Bring me along.

315
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:39,040
Come.

316
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:00,319
What?

317
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,959
What are you doing?

318
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:07,719
They are lighting the firewood.

319
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,520
What are you doing?

320
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,959
What are you doing?

321
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:12,880
Lingzheng.

322
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:14,959
How dare you use such a lowly trick

323
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:15,719
on us?

324
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:18,400
You have no shame.

325
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:20,439
I...

326
00:21:20,439 --> 00:21:21,199
What should we do?

327
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,239
We can't go down.

328
00:21:57,959 --> 00:21:58,719
Take this, Qiu Yan.

329
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,040
Thanks.

330
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:02,000
Stop tearing. We don't have time.

331
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,719
Cover your mouth.

332
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:29,599
(Hongzhen Holy Palace)
The Imperial Park of Hongzhen Sect.

333
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:32,239
We don't have much time now.

334
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,319
Let's go.

335
00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:34,694
(Hongzhen Holy Palace)

336
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,199
All trespassers will be beheaded.

337
00:22:37,921 --> 00:22:40,187
(Hongzhen Holy Palace)

338
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,199
Over here. Rescue them.

339
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,680
Qin Xuan. We're here!

340
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:26,160
Don't worry, Qiu Yan.

341
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,119
I'm coming to save you.

342
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,239
Charge!

343
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,040
Excuse me.

344
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,040
Are they Lord Liang's people?

345
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,319
Yes.

346
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:48,400
Upstairs now!

347
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:53,839
Sir Jin.

348
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,359
Back off now.

349
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,280
Sir!

350
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,400
What are you doing?

351
00:24:13,479 --> 00:24:15,160
Follow me. Hug me tight.

352
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:18,880
Are you ready?

353
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,880
Don't be afraid. Here we go.

354
00:24:35,479 --> 00:24:36,040
Are you okay?

355
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:36,959
Yes.

356
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,599
Thank you for saving me.

357
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,479
Qiu Yan. Are you okay?

358
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,199
Qin Xuan, how do you know we're here?

359
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:53,479
Sir. Sorry, I'm late.

360
00:24:54,719 --> 00:24:55,599
Your wound...

361
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,479
I'm fine.

362
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,199
I focused too much on rescuing you.

363
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,920
The head of Hongzhen Sect died.

364
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,359
You did the right thing.

365
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:04,760
Let's talk once we're back.

366
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,359
Bring them back first.

367
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,599
Come.

368
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,959
Bring all of them back.

369
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,199
All of you, bring them back.

370
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,400
Come. Get up.

371
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:12,359
Come.

372
00:25:14,239 --> 00:25:14,800
Hurry.

373
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:24,560
Careful.

374
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,119
Watch out!

375
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:40,000
Qin Xuan.

376
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:41,760
Are you all right?

377
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:48,640
I just killed someone
for the first time.

378
00:25:51,439 --> 00:25:52,880
Qiu Yan. Check Mr. Tao Zhugong.

379
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,640
He is not the assassin
who killed Xiao Tie.

380
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,719
The crossbow is on his right arm

381
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,680
while the one who killed Xiao Tie
shot with his left arm.

382
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,599
So Xiao Tie's assassin

383
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:17,160
is someone else.

384
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:21,040
They still slipped away.

385
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:26,160
Treacherous disciples!

386
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,079
Did I not treat you kindly enough?

387
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,280
(Guangmei Hall)
All of you betrayed me

388
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:31,760
- the moment it mattered.
- My lord.

389
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,719
- You are still alive.
- The audacity, all of you.

390
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:34,800
Sir, they almost killed me.

391
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:36,560
Fortunately, the officials
came in time to save me.

392
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,839
Why are the Imperial Guards here?

393
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,760
(Guangmei Hall)
Did I not give you everything?

394
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,199
Seems like we have gotten
the Imperial Court's attention.

395
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:47,479
How should we answer to His Majesty?

396
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,239
We can't hide it anymore.
Let's come clean.

397
00:26:49,239 --> 00:26:49,680
Okay.

398
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:51,319
Greetings, Grand Preceptor.

399
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,680
His Majesty was shocked to learn
a fire broke out in the Imperial Park.

400
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,319
I was sent here to investigate.

401
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,760
Why are you here too, Lord Liang?

402
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,119
My cunning disciple instigated
an insurgence.

403
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,280
Fortunately,
Lord Liang intervened in time.

404
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,079
The disciples have all been apprehended.

405
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,640
A fire within the Imperial Park
is a serious matter.

406
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,079
Grand Preceptor,
please enter the palace with me

407
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,959
and explain to His Majesty.

408
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:18,719
As for the traitors
the Grand Preceptor mentioned...

409
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:20,160
Come forth.

410
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,280
Tie them down and carry them away.

411
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:22,880
Imperial Commander Yan.

412
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:24,959
Other than an insurgence,

413
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,400
these criminals are also involved

414
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:28,520
in a fake notes fraud
the Firewood Office is investigating.

415
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:30,040
Can you hand them over
to the Firewood Office?

416
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:33,520
Lord Liang, His Majesty
wants to handle this matter himself.

417
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,119
Perhaps we can keep them

418
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,359
and let His Majesty decide later?

419
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,880
What do you think, Lord Liang?

420
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:43,560
How scrupulous of you,
Imperial Commander Yan.

421
00:27:44,959 --> 00:27:45,479
Oh,

422
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,119
this girl is a maid in Wanyan House.

423
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,439
She's not related to the case at all.

424
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,719
She was merely a guide to bring us here.

425
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:53,079
Please allow me

426
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:54,280
to see her back.

427
00:27:56,479 --> 00:27:57,760
Lord Liang is telling the truth.

428
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,280
This lady here does not work
in this Imperial Park.

429
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:04,040
It's just a trivial matter.
You decide, Lord Liang.

430
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,079
See you, Grand Preceptor.

431
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,160
Lord Liang.

432
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,319
I will not forget what you did today.

433
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:15,839
It is my duty.

434
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,959
Come. Bring them away.

435
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,560
He can switch his mood so quickly.

436
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,280
As if

437
00:28:27,479 --> 00:28:29,439
he wasn't the lousy drunkard

438
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,839
from just now.

439
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:32,839
The Six Ministries with their respective
ministers are all like this.

440
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:33,839
What he was saying is

441
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:35,239
the Imperial Guards

442
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:37,400
will take care of those people
in the Wanyan House too.

443
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,359
Song Jin, did you locate their treasury

444
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:40,920
in your search last night?

445
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:42,439
Yes, sir.

446
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,920
But we couldn't find the ledger.

447
00:28:46,439 --> 00:28:48,439
When I stole the fake note,

448
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:50,640
I came across this small book

449
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,719
with tons of names

450
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:53,760
and dates on it.

451
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:55,920
Ping'er. Where is the book now?

452
00:28:57,199 --> 00:28:58,239
My father should have it.

453
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,920
As well as the other fake notes
that aren't used yet.

454
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:03,719
Let's head to Wanyan House
with Ping'er

455
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,920
before the Imperial Guards
seal that place.

456
00:29:07,199 --> 00:29:07,920
Qiu Yan.

457
00:29:08,719 --> 00:29:09,479
This is...

458
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,079
I'll explain to you later.

459
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,520
Let me tag along.

460
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,520
Mr. Qin.

461
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,359
My Master is there for serious business.

462
00:29:18,719 --> 00:29:21,280
We should wait for them
in the Firewood Office.

463
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:23,760
I only trust them too.

464
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,439
Qin Xuan, you should head back
with Song Jin.

465
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,760
Lord Liang and I will be back soon.

466
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:31,079
Wait for us in the Firewood Office.

467
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,959
Be careful.

468
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,560
Let's go.

469
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:36,760
I'll wait for you
in the Firewood Office.

470
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:37,359
Okay.

471
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,239
Father.

472
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,760
Father.

473
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:47,760
Father.

474
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:52,160
Father.

475
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,760
Ping'er!

476
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,640
- Father!
- Ping'er!

477
00:29:54,682 --> 00:29:55,511
(Wanyan House)

478
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,319
Oh, my Ping'er.

479
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,319
Where were you last night?

480
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,520
Many officers surrounded
Wanyan House yesterday.

481
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,160
I was looking for you everywhere.

482
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:04,880
Father, I...

483
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,479
When I was stealing
some fake notes yesterday,

484
00:30:08,199 --> 00:30:10,040
I bumped into these two officers
from the Firewood Office.

485
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,280
They said they would pardon me.

486
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:16,983
(Wanyan House)
Greetings, officers.

487
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,400
Thank you for giving my daughter
another chance.

488
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,199
Save that for later.

489
00:30:23,719 --> 00:30:24,800
I heard from your daughter

490
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,359
that you kept the fake notes she stole?

491
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,880
Indeed.

492
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:30,920
The fake notes are all in my abode.

493
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,920
I will show them to you now.

494
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:35,400
Ping'er.

495
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,760
A client from yesterday

496
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:39,400
gave us some delicacies
from Daoyu Pastry.

497
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,319
I know you like them a lot

498
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:42,560
so I save them for you.

499
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,560
Come with me, officers.

500
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:54,599
Inside, please.

501
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,319
The living place of a servant.

502
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:58,319
Please don't mind it, officers.

503
00:30:58,719 --> 00:30:59,719
Please give me a moment.

504
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:00,760
I'll retrieve the cash notes now.

505
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:03,160
Have a seat.

506
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:10,280
Have some tea.

507
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,040
Thank you.

508
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,839
Watch out!

509
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,760
Ping'er. Ping'er.

510
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,520
Don't, Ping'er.

511
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:23,680
Leave me be!

512
00:31:29,199 --> 00:31:29,839
Ping'er.

513
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,280
Father?

514
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:41,000
Father.

515
00:31:43,439 --> 00:31:44,040
Father.

516
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:46,839
Father.

517
00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:37,400
Who are you?

518
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,479
Your sworn enemy.

519
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,719
I don't even know you.

520
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:42,959
Did we cross paths?

521
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,359
Huizhou Magistrate, Dou Ying.

522
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:47,359
He was killed because you framed him.

523
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,719
Do you remember him?

524
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:50,839
I investigated many officials.

525
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,959
This does not jog my memory.

526
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:54,680
I will never forget that

527
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,839
because Dou Ying was my father.

528
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,920
Sir, I searched everywhere.

529
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:26,959
He must be the bodyguard who saved you.

530
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:36,760
A crossbow on his left arm.

531
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,439
He must be Xiao Tie's assassin.

532
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:42,880
What is Lingzheng to you two?

533
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,680
Why did he do Lingzheng's bidding?

534
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,520
We wandered to the Capital.

535
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:51,560
We had no shelter and no food.

536
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,079
I'm good at drawing

537
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,719
so I devoted myself to
forging fake notes.

538
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,760
Unfortunately, Mr. Lingzheng found out.

539
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:02,239
Young girl.

540
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:05,079
How dare you scam me with fake notes?

541
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,560
Follow me to the court.

542
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,239
- Mister.
- Come!

543
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,399
I'll pay for her buns.

544
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,120
Thanks, sir.

545
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,360
- Thanks, sir.
- All right.

546
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,520
Fresh buns!

547
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:22,719
You drew this?

548
00:34:25,382 --> 00:34:27,360
(Heng Gui Banknotes, Five Taels)
He said I was talented

549
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:30,679
so he hired Xiao Tie to tutor me.

550
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,479
My bodyguard was good at fighting.

551
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,560
To protect me,

552
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,679
he did Lingzheng's bidding.

553
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,439
He hid you two in Wanyan House.

554
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,560
A perfect hiding place,

555
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,600
I must say.

556
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:53,360
I don't regret being someone's pawn.

557
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,479
The only thing I regret

558
00:34:56,959 --> 00:34:59,560
is I failed to take your life just now.

559
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,800
Liang Yi.

560
00:35:02,439 --> 00:35:03,639
You accused my father

561
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,360
of embezzling one million taels.

562
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,120
My family is ruined because of you.

563
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:10,679
I will come back
to haunt you as a ghost.

564
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,439
Vengeance is all you can see.

565
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,959
Have you thought about his life?

566
00:35:22,479 --> 00:35:24,120
The Dou family hired him.

567
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:26,719
He would want to give his life for us.

568
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,560
He didn't want to avenge the Dou family.

569
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:31,360
Otherwise, he would have killed me

570
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,360
when he was trying to kill Xiao Tie.

571
00:35:34,479 --> 00:35:35,560
I think he was happy

572
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,120
being your father.

573
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:38,000
I don't care.

574
00:36:01,889 --> 00:36:02,800
(Daoyu Pastry)

575
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,560
You said Lord Liang killed your father.

576
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:21,919
But you killed
your other father yourself.

577
00:36:23,919 --> 00:36:25,959
He left these snacks for you.

578
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,560
He never ever took a bite.

579
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,719
You truly don't remember
the Dou family's case?

580
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,040
Why do you ask?

581
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:03,479
You and I are both very petty.

582
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,040
By extrapolation,

583
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,239
I don't think you're this forgetful.

584
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,399
Year 22 of Chengzhao.

585
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,560
Huizhou Magistrate, Dou Ying,

586
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:13,360
accepted bribery,
sold governmental positions,

587
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,199
and embezzled public funds.

588
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:17,239
(In his house, we found
10,000 taels worth of gold)

589
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,199
(500,000 taels worth of silver,)

590
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,600
(and tens of precious objects.)

591
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:21,199
(I remember every case)

592
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,520
(I solved.)

593
00:37:23,399 --> 00:37:24,560
Sir, I checked everywhere.

594
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,479
If her father was guilty,

595
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:49,800
why didn't you tell her the truth?

596
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,800
Children

597
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,800
only see the best of their parents.

598
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,439
Why ruin that illusion for her?

599
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,479
Oh,

600
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,000
when Ping'er was about to attack me,

601
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,760
you stopped her in time.

602
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,320
How did you know
she was about to make a move?

603
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,879
Wanyan House is a place
filled with perfume.

604
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:09,360
But the perfume Ping'er wears

605
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,000
is different from the workers there.

606
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:13,320
The perfume pouch she carries

607
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:15,199
is from Liuxiang Perfumery
in the West District.

608
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:16,719
The perfume pouch from that place

609
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:18,399
costs at least one tael

610
00:38:18,479 --> 00:38:19,840
and you need to buy a new one
every fortnight.

611
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,239
Otherwise, the fragrance will fade.

612
00:38:22,479 --> 00:38:24,239
If Ping'er truly committed thievery

613
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:25,639
due to poverty,

614
00:38:25,919 --> 00:38:27,679
why would she carry a luxury
like that then?

615
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,320
I didn't know you were that well-versed
in feminine products.

616
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:33,760
My sister, Qiu Min,

617
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:35,239
is obsessed with the perfume pouch
from Liuxiang Perfumery.

618
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:36,239
She always talks about it

619
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,719
and that's why I know the subject well.

620
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:41,679
Wait. What were you implying?

621
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,879
You think I'm not womanly enough?

622
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,439
I just want

623
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,239
to thank you.

624
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:53,760
I saved your life and you saved mine.

625
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,000
We're even now.

626
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:56,879

that the Firewood Office
barged into my imperial park,

660
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:46,479
crossed arms with Lingzheng's people,

661
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,399
to save you and Liang Yi?

662
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:51,040
It is my incompetence

663
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,719
that allowed outsiders to barge into
the Imperial Park

664
00:40:52,879 --> 00:40:54,719
and destroyed the place of worship

I await my punishment.

667
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,520
Lingzheng was the main culprit

668
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,159
and he has been captured.

669
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,360
God has preserved justice.

670
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,560
Since God has delivered the judgment,

671
00:41:22,919 --> 00:41:23,959
I shouldn't.

672
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,280
You have been in shock for half a day.

673
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,120
Go back and rest.

674
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:30,840
Discipline your disciples well too.

675
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,600
It's fine if my pills are destroyed.

676
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,719

677
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,439
and God decides to punish our subjects,

678
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,280
it will be too great a sin
for both of us.

679
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:45,280
Understood, Your Majesty.

680
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:46,760
Dismissed.

681
00:41:47,399 --> 00:41:47,919
Yes, Your Majesty.

682
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:57,360
Your Majesty,

683
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,479
do we let the Firewood Office

684
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,879
see the follow-up through?

685
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,239
Have you found that someone

686
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:06,879
I asked you to?

687
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:08,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

688
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:27,919
Done.

689
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,120
Why break the chain?

690
00:42:31,399 --> 00:42:33,239
Is there no key that can open
the handcuffs?

691
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:35,959
Tocharian Golden Handcuffs
have a sophisticated design.

692
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:37,399
You cannot replicate the key.

693
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,600
Breaking it open by force

694
00:42:38,879 --> 00:42:39,879
will only cause injuries.

695
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:42,439
The Firewood Office
doesn't have a spare key?

696
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,080
The Tocharians only gave us one.

697
00:42:44,399 --> 00:42:45,399
If we want the key to open it,

698
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,600
we need a Tocharian blacksmith.

699
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,280
You're saying

700
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,120
that we need to send someone
to the Tarim Basin to find a blacksmith?

701
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,760
How long will a return journey take?

702
00:42:54,919 --> 00:42:57,239
Around two months.

703
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,239
Sir, news from the Imperial Court.

704
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,280
His Majesty assigned the fake notes

705
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,479
and the Imperial Park case
to the Main Administrative Office.

706
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,040
The Firewood Office
has been handling this case.

707
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,959
The case can be concluded soon

708
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,520
so why hand it
to someone else right now?

709
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:11,800
I'm not surprised.

710
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,959
Song Jin charged into the imperial park
to save me.

711
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,199
That's a serious crime on its own.

712
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,040
His Majesty did not admonish us.

713
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,399
He just wants us to cease
what we're doing.

714
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,439
So be it then.

715
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:23,760
Song Jin.

716
00:43:24,399 --> 00:43:26,719
Transfer all evidence that you found
in Wanyan House's treasury

717
00:43:26,919 --> 00:43:28,000
to the Main Administrative Office.

718
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:29,040
Go now.

719
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:29,800
Wait.

720
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:32,159
Can I have a look at them first?

721
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,159
If the snitch from my house bought
fake notes from Wanyan House,

722
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,639
he must have left a trace.

723
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,399
And now,

724
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:42,000
the ledger for the fake notes
is nowhere to be found.

725
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:44,719
I want to see if I can

726
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:47,479
find something from the evidence pile.

727
00:43:48,439 --> 00:43:49,040
Or else,

728
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:51,360
today will be in vain.

Everything we confiscated

733
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:03,399
has been labeled.

734
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,959
