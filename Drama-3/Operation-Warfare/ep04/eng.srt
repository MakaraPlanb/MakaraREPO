1
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,690
Next,

2
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,580
you must find out

3
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,530
James's new energy technology data for me

4
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,370
in the shortest possible time.

5
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,140
You've been looking for it for two years.

6
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,290
We can't put it off any longer.

7
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,290
We've been trying to do it in many ways

8
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,450
for the past two years.

9
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:54,980
Boss

10
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,260
Don't worry too much.

11
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:57,930
Can I not rush?

12
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,060
The global energy conference is just around the corner,

13
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,610
and once new energy results

14
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,930
like the one James studied.

15
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,500
Be made public at a convention.

16
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,770
The new energy technology we have now

17
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,770
is just a piece of waste paper.

18
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,540
The grand project of monopolizing new energy.

19
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:13,730
It will be destroyed.

20
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,290
Boss, don't worry.

21
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,540
If the new energy conference is really held,

22
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,570
we will step up the development of super bomb now.

23
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,660
They just want to blow up the New Energy Congress.

24
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,450
This group of experts.

25
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,220
Do you think my method is good?

26
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:25,700
so that

27
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,340
we can also achieve our goals.

28
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,250
Enough

29
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,250
Now, on the one hand, we have to work hard

30
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,610
to find James's data.

31
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,380
We can't let it get out.

32
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,660
On the other hand,

33
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,050
hurry up and develop a bomb.

34
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,140
And find a way to transport the bomb.

35
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,770
Make sure the energy conference is ruined.

36
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,090
That's the only way.

37
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,300
In order to ensure that our energy technology

38
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,450
will occupy the market forever.

39
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,260
Always make extra profits for us.

40
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:49,500
I see.

41
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,580
Tell me!

42
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,900
Where is the backup of the data?

43
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,220
I... I.

44
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,900
I really don't know.

45
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,140
What data?

46
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,330
Why are you still lying?

47
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:03,180
No

48
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,540
I beg you.

49
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,690
Please let us go.

50
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,900
James never gave it to me.

51
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,010
What data?

52
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,370
Brother

53
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,300
I don't have much patience.

54
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,820
I'm going to ask you one last time.

55
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,690
Where is the data?

56
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,650
Why are you looking for James's bodyguard?

57
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:29,940
bodyguard

58
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,050
Which bodyguard?

59
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,620
Just the one on the computer two days ago.

60
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:36,940
I... I... I.

61
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,900
I remember now.

62
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,050
I did look for him.

63
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,940
I... I'm looking for him.

64
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,260
I also want to get that data back.

65
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:44,820
but

66
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,330
I tried to find it.

67
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,580
Everyone James knew.

68
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,100
But

69
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,020
They don't know.

70
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,580
The whereabouts of the data,

71
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,020
so I thought of this person.

72
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,380
I want to give it a try.

73
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,410
Will he know?

74
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,330
Really?

75
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,660
It's true.

76
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,220
He's sweating. It seems that

77
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,770
he really doesn't know.

78
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,050
These terrorists

79
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,170
are becoming increasingly rampant now.

80
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,740
Just last night.

81
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,050
a former partner

82
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,660
of Dr. James.

83
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,140
The couple are at home.

84
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,380
Was brutally killed.

85
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,460
According to the investigation conducted by the public security department,

86
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,220
it is confirmed that this is S Group.

87
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,410
The work of terrorist organizations.

88
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,170
Two years ago,

89
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,300
after the Dr. James case,

90
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,690
the S Group has been haunting us.

91
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,660
The most hateful thing

92
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,250
about trying to get Dr. James's

93
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,530
new energy data

94
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,690
by all means is that

95
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,660
these terrorists

96
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,170
are trying to use it.

97
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,810
monopolize the world's new energy market.

98
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,380
But also want to use this equation.

99
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,970
To create a terrifying super bomb.

100
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,050
It was getting closer and closer

101
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,020
to the date of Operation Lightning.

102
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:14,330
so

103
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,660
The Blue Lightning Commando

104
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,300
must complete the reorganization as soon as possible.

105
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,380
Form combat effectiveness.

106
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:19,100
Yes

107
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,460
Qin Guan

108
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,020
It's a critical moment now.

109
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,810
If Blue Lightning

110
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,300
can't fix our uniforms.

111
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,660
But I have to take them off.

112
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:30,500
Yes

113
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,380
One, two,

114
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:33,770
one,

115
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,610
two,

116
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,530
three, four, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, one,

117
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,300
two, three

118
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,860
Yi four

119
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:57,370
Stop

120
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,060
Stop

121
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:58,340
Don't run!

122
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:00,460
Stop

123
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,250
Go save her.

124
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:08,900
Yes

125
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,020
Call the police immediately.

126
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:15,740
Stop

127
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,410
Guo Xiaowei

128
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,580
led his men to clear the barricades.

129
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,620
Everyone else, come with me.

130
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,180
Use local materials

131
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,900
to stop bleeding and bandage. Call me

132
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,090
if you have any special circumstances.

133
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,180
Yes

134
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:35,780
Put the roadblock away.

135
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,090
Yang Shu

136
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:36,690
Call 120

137
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:37,970
and report to the detachment leader.

138
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:38,490
Okay

139
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,250
Check your limbs.

140
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,370
Leg injury.

141
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,340
The rest of the place is fine.

142
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,580
Wang Yu,

143
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:55,860
stop the car!

144
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,300
What should we do?

145
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:13,780
I can't take care of it anymore.

146
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,340
All the things we pull behind us are contraband.

147
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,620
Either way, it's a death.

148
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:17,930
Run!

149
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,460
Be careful!

150
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:12,460
Hurry up

151
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,180
Dongdong

152
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:18,490
Yes

153
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,340
Make a bandage.

154
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:19,650
Okay

155
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,140
Li Sisi, what are you doing?

156
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,900
I'm doing artificial respiration to save people.

157
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:28,460
Wait.

158
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,250
Check it out before you see.

159
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,460
It's important to save people.

160
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:31,580
Li Sisi

161
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:32,460
Zhuang Qian

162
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,460
He's not breathing.

163
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,650
What's going on?

164
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,900
He's not breathing.

165
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,020
Li Sisi wants to give him artificial respiration.

166
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,490
Check it out.

167
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,530
Are there any commonly used medicines?

168
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:40,900
Okay

169
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,410
Zhuang Qian

170
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:00,860
Hurry up

171
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,340
Stop!

172
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:27,810
Are you feeling better?

173
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,060
Okay, nod your head.

174
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,650
It's asthma.

175
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:36,780
No problem.

176
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:37,860
Sisi

177
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,370
You're right to be eager to save people.

178
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,490
But score clearly.

179
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:41,650
He's fine now.

180
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:42,460
Take care of it

181
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,210
That's right

182
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,410
You still don't listen to me.

183
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:46,090
Where are

184
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,210
your limbs?

185
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:47,970
What's going on?

186
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:48,580
Watch his head.

187
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:49,970
Help! Help me open it!

188
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,410
Go away!

189
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:52,970
Tong Mengyao, what's going on?

190
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:53,780
asthma

191
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,020
Li Sisi needs artificial respiration.

192
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:56,930
Self-approbation.

193
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:57,780
It's true.

194
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,530
Are you okay?

195
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,340
Are you feeling better?

196
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,050
Feng

197
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,250
Stop running.

198
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,220
Help me!

199
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,100
I'll leave this to both of you.

200
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:19,810
I'll go after that.

201
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:20,610
Yes

202
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,250
Where are the people in the car?

203
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:34,660
He went that way.

204
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:48,610
Which workshop are you from?

205
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:49,490
Get out of the way!

206
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:50,610
Get out of the way!

207
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:52,730
Brother

208
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,290
Brother

209
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,490
Take it easy.

210
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,140
I'm just a bull killer.

211
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:57,580
Don't embarrass me.

212
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:58,980
Shut up!

213
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,460
Get out of the way.

214
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,730
Or I'll kill him.

215
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:03,810
Take it easy, brother.

216
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:04,810
Take it easy.

217
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:05,690
Let me take a break.

218
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,370
Get out of there.

219
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:10,420
Get out of there.

220
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:11,850
Well

221
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:13,850
Take it easy, bro.

222
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,140
Look at me.

223
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:16,730
I'm unarmed.

224
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,050
How am I your opponent?

225
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:18,690
Don't go forward.

226
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:19,660
Back off!

227
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,660
Okay, okay.

228
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,250
Okay

229
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,490
Take it easy, take it easy.

230
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,020
Let's talk about it.

231
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,170
Look, I've said so much.

232
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,370
He hit someone with his car.

233
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,810
It has nothing to do with you.

234
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,050
It's not you who's driving.

235
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:32,780
It's him

236
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:33,690
Right?

237
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,020
If you want to do it, you have to punish him.

238
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,490
It's none of your business.

239
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,540
Cut the crap.

240
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,250
I'll let the hostages go when I'm safe.

241
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,580
Or I'll kill him.

242
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,100
Captain

243
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,140
What are you doing here?

244
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,170
Let's go.

245
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:46,930
It's enough to have me here.

246
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,020
Captain, I.

247
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,540
I'll let you go.

248
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,490
Hurry up!

249
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:53,580
Hurry up

250
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,100
This girl is quite stubborn in the film.

251
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,610
He was sent away by me.

252
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:09,810
It's just the three of us.

253
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,850
Let's have a good talk.

254
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,900
Put the knife down.

255
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,780
Let's talk about it.

256
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,370
Whether or not?

257
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:21,730
Cut the crap.

258
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:22,100
even if

259
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,140
It's just the three of us.

260
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,610
You're safe.

261
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,900
You've been running for so long and you're not tired.

262
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,170
I'm tired.

263
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:29,900
Come on.

264
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,250
Let's sit down and have a chat.

265
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:32,780
Don't sit there.

266
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:33,580
Don't sit there.

267
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:34,580
Okay, okay.

268
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:35,730
Then I won't sit down.

269
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,730
Calm down, bro.

270
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:39,900
I'll count to three.

271
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,810
Get out of there now.

272
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,370
Brother

273
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,250
One

274
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,420
Actually, it's about you.

275
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,250
Not much.

276
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,050
You let him go?

277
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:45,780
You just

278
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:46,810
Then you can leave.

279
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,540
Two

280
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,540
Put the knife down and let's have a good talk.

281
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,290
Three

282
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:58,850
Captain

283
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,900
The traffic police have called for help.

284
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:01,580
Okay

285
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:03,580
Your wound.

286
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,170
It's okay

287
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,170
Don't make a fuss.

288
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:16,980
I'll do it myself.

289
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,540
She said she was fine.

290
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,850
There's so much blood.

291
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,140
Look at this wound.

292
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,660
You need at least a few stitches.

293
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,050
Why are you talking to a new recruit

294
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:34,930
who has never seen the world

295
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:35,780
It's okay

296
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,660
Why are you pretending to be a tough guy?

297
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,050
I should have killed you with my car.

298
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,100
What's wrong?

299
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,690
You bitch still want to hit me?

300
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,020
Ning Meng

301
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,250
What exactly is going on this time?

302
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,140
An investigation by the police confirmed that

303
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,810
the driver

304
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,420
was indeed carrying chemical contraband.

305
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,220
Chemical violations

306
00:13:59,580 --> 00:13:59,930
Yes

307
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,690
According to the preliminary judgment,

308
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,340
it is a very dangerous chemical.

309
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,020
The exact composition is still being analyzed.

310
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:05,730
Alright

311
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,490
The follow-up work

312
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,780
will be handed over to the public security department.

313
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,370
in addition

314
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,580
Ning Meng beat the suspect for no reason

315
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,580
and had a bad influence on the troops.

316
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,660
I suggest.

317
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,340
Take her seriously.

318
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:18,220
Report

319
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:19,340
Speak

320
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:21,930
This operation.

321
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,490
If there is no decisive disposal of Ning Meng,

322
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,540
the consequences will be unimaginable.

323
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,250
She was in the middle of a fight with a suspect.

324
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:26,780
On impulse.

325
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,660
Was it in a struggle?

326
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,420
The criminal suspect

327
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,850
has no resistance.

328
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,340
Ning Meng only injured him.

329
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,250
As a special warfare player,

330
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,170
no matter at any time.

331
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,460
You have to be able to

332
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,730
control your emotions under any circumstances.

333
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,660
Instead of being controlled by emotions.

334
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:43,900
She's impulsive.

335
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,100
It means that she is far from being a qualified member

336
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:46,690
of the special operations team.

337
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:47,490
Report

338
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,610
I concur with the commissar.

339
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,850
This matter must be dealt with seriously.

340
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,370
166。 .

341
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,370
167。 .

342
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,250
168。 .

343
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,020
169。 .

344
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,420
How are you feeling?

345
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,490
It feels good.

346
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,170
How's your injury?

347
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:14,730
It's okay.

348
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,660
Follow my orders.

349
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:20,610
Attention!

350
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:27,930
Although your spirit is admirable.

351
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,660
However, it is in line with the regulations to take administrative care of you

352
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,020
when your emotions are out of control.

353
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,100
You need to be conscious

354
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,140
of your own mistakes.

355
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,340
Seriously reflect on it

356
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,810
and write a written examination and hand it in.

357
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,780
Otherwise, you can't pass the customs

358
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:46,810
with the political commissar.

359
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,050
Then should I finish the examination?

360
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:49,900
Then we can go out.

361
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,690
That depends on your examination.

362
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:53,580
Is it deep?

363
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,810
I will reflect on it

364
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,420
but

365
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,020
I have one more request.

366
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,140
Tell me

367
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,050
I want to read "Outbreak" written by Barabbas

368
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,290
It's a book about big data analytics.

369
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,540
I haven't finished the examination yet.

370
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,290
What book are you reading?

371
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,100
I'll tell you

372
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:21,930
when I have time.

373
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,900
You still care about your soldiers.

374
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,460
What do you know?

375
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,370
I'm standing in the position of a captain.

376
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,490
I don't want her to go behind her back.

377
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,540
Leave from the blue electricity.

378
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,100
Are you still not going to keep her?

379
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,690
I heard she was locked up this time.

380
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,610
But because of you.

381
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,580
Don't confuse the concept. One yard

382
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:45,730
goes one yard

383
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,100
at a time. In fact, you still care about Ning Meng.

384
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,170
Emergencies are the most testing.

385
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,610
Ning Meng's performance this time

386
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,780
is enough to prove that she is an excellent soldier.

387
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,050
The detachment leader admired her so much.

388
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,100
You've trained her so hard during this time.

389
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,250
How is she doing?

390
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,610
We all know that.

391
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:04,610
I'm done.

392
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:05,660
No

393
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,100
Then you can stay and talk to the picket.

394
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:09,980
I'm tired of listening.

395
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:26,980
With a new recruit

396
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,730
who has never seen the world

397
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:28,690
It's okay

398
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:29,930
Why are you pretending to be a tough guy?

399
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,340
I should have killed you with my car.

400
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,290
I heard she was locked up this time.

401
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,290
But because of you.

402
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,290
Don't confuse the concept. One yard

403
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,420
goes one yard

404
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,810
at a time. In fact, you still care about Ning Meng.

405
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,180
Ning Meng's examination

406
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,180
is quite profound.

407
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,940
You only know how to write.

408
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,250
That's better than

409
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,570
forcing you to do it.

410
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,300
Whatever you say is right.

411
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,330
I'm telling you,

412
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,330
in the future.

413
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,330
You must make sure that a bowl of water ends flat.

414
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,700
Make such a mistake again.

415
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:11,660
I won't spare you.

416
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:13,370
Yes

417
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,300
Go home.

418
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:22,700
Anything else?

419
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:24,660
Let me tell you something.

420
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,180
What about the car incident?

421
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:29,210
I think it's necessary to strengthen it.

422
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,300
the battlefield medical training for soldiers.

423
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,300
Zhuang Qian will train them.

424
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,140
Okay

425
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,250
Hurry up and carry it out.

426
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:38,570
Yes

427
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:41,570
But.

428
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,210
Because the arrangement of the follow-up subjects is rather tight.

429
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:45,540
I'm afraid I don't have time.

430
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,970
The second training has been arranged.

431
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,780
What do you mean?

432
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,370
I mean,

433
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,540
it's better to have all of them here.

434
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,610
When did you learn

435
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,300
to beat around the bush?

436
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,730
Ning Meng's administrative supervision

437
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,490
is decided by the Party Committee of the detachment.

438
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,660
It's not over when you say it's over.

439
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,180
We can make up for our mistakes, right?

440
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,300
What?

441
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,820
You know how to protect the nonsense now.

442
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,780
Wen Jing didn't do anything wrong.

443
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,780
You are a dead duck with a straight mouth.

444
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:23,970
Discipline is discipline.

445
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,090
Let's not talk about it.

446
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:34,820
class monitor

447
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:37,900
What do you do?

448
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,300
I... I'm here to bring some fruit to Ning Meng.

449
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:43,610
Any orders?

450
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,060
No

451
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:46,020
No

452
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,490
It's your first day as a soldier?

453
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:48,900
No

454
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,490
I'll just go in and take a look.

455
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,850
Go in and I'll come out.

456
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,330
No

457
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,090
Not even half an eye.

458
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:53,780
Go back.

459
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,180
Me

460
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,940
Brother Hao Zhe.

461
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:35,610
Sisi.

462
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,490
Why did you come out in the middle of the night?

463
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,420
Are you going to see Ning Meng?

464
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,330
I think you are the same.

465
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,700
Forget it.

466
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,180
I can't get in at all.

467
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,700
Let's go to see Ning Meng Normal

468
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,420
What are you doing here?

469
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,730
I care about my comrades too.

470
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,780
I stopped by to have a look.

471
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,660
I didn't expect that

472
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,060
you care so much about Ning Meng.

473
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:10,900
Don't think about it.

474
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,450
I admire her for her excellent military quality.

475
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,420
It's a role model for us.

476
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,210
Okay

477
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,330
Then I won't stop you from making progress.

478
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,610
Think about how to get in first.

479
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,610
Of course I have my own way.

480
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:25,730
Fine

481
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,540
I'm leaving.

482
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,060
Wait

483
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,540
Why don't we cooperate tactically?

484
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:36,570
Tell me

485
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:46,210
class monitor

486
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:48,970
Why are you here so late?

487
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,700
I stopped by to see you.

488
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:51,540
Come on

489
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:52,490
I know.

490
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,140
You're looking at the one in there, right?

491
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:57,300
Let's watch it together.

492
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:59,250
Please give me some accommodation.

493
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,610
It's not that I'm giving you a hard time.

494
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,300
It's the rules of our special forces unit.

495
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,020
You know that.

496
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,940
I can't accommodate you.

497
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:19,610
Ning Meng

498
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,570
Sisi

499
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,820
Since you just beat the grass and scared the snake,

500
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,420
it's impossible to attack head-on.

501
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:28,900
I draw fire from the front.

502
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:30,450
Go around behind enemy lines.

503
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,210
Try to get the strategic materials

504
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,730
to Ning Meng.

505
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:35,900
reliable

506
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,700
Or do you understand me?

507
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:40,900
Open the window.

508
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:48,570
Hurry up!

509
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:58,420
Is it okay to enter now?

510
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,210
Then I'm going in.

511
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,060
Who says you can go in?

512
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,700
The door is open.

513
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,780
Let me have a look.

514
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:03,450
No

515
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,370
The brigade has rules.

516
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:06,730
Sisi

517
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,060
Luckily, Chen Haozhe is covering for us.

518
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,180
Go back now.

519
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:13,730
Okay

520
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,850
Pay more attention to yourself

521
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,140
quickly

522
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:21,570
Get out

523
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,540
Just take a look.

524
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,140
Get out

525
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,090
Then I'll come to see you tomorrow.

526
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:27,540
class monitor

527
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,730
OK. Let's go.

528
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,330
Are you okay?

529
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,250
It's okay

530
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:12,610
Captain

531
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:14,970
Have a seat

532
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,850
It's done.

533
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,140
Don't worry.

534
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:23,780
Let's eat

535
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:29,970
Captain

536
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,730
There's something I don't know if I should ask.

537
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,210
The injury has been reexamined.

538
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:34,900
No problem.

539
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,060
There's one more thing.

540
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:39,660
Shouldn't have asked.

541
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,090
Take care, captain.

542
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:53,730
Mr. Wu.

543
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:54,970
I have bad news.

544
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,060
Our shipment was confiscated.

545
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,020
Who is it?

546
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:58,820
armed police

547
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,900
The police and armed police now

548
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,700
have a very strict control over contraband.

549
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,060
The risk of our action is getting bigger and bigger.

550
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:10,850
This is James'network.

551
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,660
It's all up there.

552
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,140
This is the last one.

553
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,420
This is the last one.

554
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,490
I checked it last night.

555
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:27,540
He doesn't know anything.

556
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,610
Check it carefully again.

557
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,540
Boss

558
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:41,250
I've checked all the people on it

559
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,210
at least three times.

560
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,370
They don't know anything.

561
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,330
It's impossible.

562
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:46,780
According to James's personality,

563
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:48,330
he will definitely keep a backup.

564
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,180
I will definitely give it to someone to keep.

565
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,250
There must be something wrong here.

566
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,020
Go check it out.

567
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,420
Hurry up!

568
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:54,900
Yes

569
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,820
Qin commander.

570
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,900
Thank you. Thank you.

571
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:16,300
Thank you

572
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,060
You saved my life.

573
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,250
You're being serious.

574
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,450
This is what we should do.

575
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,540
Thank you. Thank you.

576
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,370
Qin commander.

577
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,820
I have one more request.

578
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,900
I want to meet my savior.

579
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:28,660
Is she here?

580
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,330
That girl's name is Ning.

581
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:35,820
Ning Meng

582
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,090
Yes, that's her.

583
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,940
You must let me meet her.

584
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,540
I have to thank her face to face.

585
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,210
She has a mission now.

586
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,060
I cann't get away from it,

587
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:43,940
qin commander.

588
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,570
I must see her.

589
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,090
It's okay

590
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:46,850
I'm not busy.

591
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:47,820
I'll wait for her here.

592
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:52,020
All right.

593
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:52,700
Have a seat.

594
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,450
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

595
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,020
Pour Director Zhu a glass of water.

596
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:57,490
Yes

597
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:58,610
Sit down.

598
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:58,900
Okay

599
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,250
Come on

600
00:27:59,330 --> 00:27:59,730
Thank you

601
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:01,090
Have a seat, Director.

602
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,610
The common people that Ning Meng saved last time.

603
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:10,900
Now he's waiting at the door

604
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,940
with the banner.

605
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,210
He said he wanted to thank you in person.

606
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:17,330
Ning Meng's kindness to save my life.

607
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:20,330
No way.

608
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,700
Ning Meng's administrative supervision

609
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,330
was decided at the meeting of the Party Committee of the detachment.

610
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:37,250
Tell me

611
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,370
You're such a big boss.

612
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,060
Just make a decision for the soldiers.

613
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,140
Don't flatter me here.

614
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,250
Alright then.

615
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,940
I'll tell him when I go out.

616
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:53,420
He said your hero was placed under administrative supervision

617
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:54,820
after he came back.

618
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:55,370
Go back.

619
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:01,210
Are you taking my army?

620
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,180
How dare I?

621
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,250
I quite agree with you.

622
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:12,420
Ning Meng's mistake

623
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,330
can't be easily forgiven.

624
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:14,940
Turn it off once.

625
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,570
Close it thoroughly.

626
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:18,300
Then you go ahead.

627
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,900
I'll explain it to my fellow villagers.

628
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:22,700
Come back here!

629
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:31,660
Tea

630
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,940
Someone wants to thank me.

631
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:43,090
I'm the one who made a mistake now.

632
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,180
I want you to see him now.

633
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,180
It's an honor you deserve.

634
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,570
But if I go like this now,

635
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:47,940
I'll be unkempt.

636
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,090
I'm embarrassing the troops.

637
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,060
Go away!

638
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,060
Clean it up.

639
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:54,940
Be quick.

640
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,570
Yes, yes, yes.

641
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:57,330
I'm on my way.

642
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:02,610
Let me get you some water.

643
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:03,780
Enough

644
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,490
Thank you. Thank you.

645
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:05,450
Okay, don't worry.

646
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,250
Our captain should be back soon.

647
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:06,700
Okay

648
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,490
Great hero Ning.

649
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,540
Thank you. Thank you.

650
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,610
If it weren't for you,

651
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,420
I would have died.

652
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:21,210
Don't get too excited.

653
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:22,900
You don't have to thank me.

654
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:25,420
The main reason is that our captain handled it properly.

655
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,140
He saved your life.

656
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,450
Thank you, chief.

657
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,210
You are really

658
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,140
the protectors of the common people.

659
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,730
Don't say that.

660
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,420
We're not a leader.

661
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,450
He's just a soldier.

662
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,210
I did what I had to do.

663
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:39,970
Our captain

664
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,180
is too modest.

665
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,090
in fact

666
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,330
It should be me. Thank you.

667
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,780
If it weren't for you,

668
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,900
I'd still be locked up.

669
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,300
What she meant was to say.

670
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,700
She did it on purpose.

671
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,940
Lock yourself in your room.

672
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,820
So that you can study with peace of mind.

673
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:02,570
You're welcome.

674
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:03,940
Qin commander.

675
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,330
I have to thank you for that.

676
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,730
If anything happens to me,

677
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,490
the whole staff and the whole family

678
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,060
will have no food to eat.

679
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,660
So I'm telling you seriously

680
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:15,900
Thank you

681
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,330
Stand up first.

682
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:44,210
It feels so good to be free.

683
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,490
No matter how good it is, you have to pay attention to it.

684
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,140
So as not to make another mistake.

685
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:49,780
Go in again.

686
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,730
I won't.

687
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,090
There is a captain who cares about me silently.

688
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:54,700
take care of

689
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:57,850
Take care of me.

690
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,610
I won't make any more mistakes.

691
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:01,610
Do I care about you?

692
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,700
I can't wait for you to stay inside for a few more days.

693
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:04,660
Take good care of it.

694
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,940
You're such a prick.

695
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,300
Li Sisi told me everything.

696
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:09,730
You took the initiative to intercede with the detachment leader

697
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:10,820
and the commissar.

698
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:19,850
Captain

699
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,420
In fact, you didn't want me

700
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,850
to return to the original army.

701
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:25,850
Right?

702
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:27,180
I want you

703
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,180
out of my sight now.

704
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:29,780
immediately

705
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,420
at once

706
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,140
Yes

707
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,700
Disappear immediately.

708
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:36,660
Salute!

709
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:39,090
Go away!

710
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,330
398。 .

711
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,060
399。 .

712
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,450
399。 .

713
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:11,820
400

714
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:18,940
Stand up

715
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:24,450
Take Li Sisi as the benchmark

716
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,060
Yes

717
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,210
Cancel the spacing

718
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,700
and align with the center.

719
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,020
Move on

720
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,020
at ease

721
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,490
Tell me about it.

722
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:38,730
Let me make an announcement.

723
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:40,900
The commander of the corps

724
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,330
is coming to our detachment to offer condolences recently.

725
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,300
Let's cheer up.

726
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:45,730
All of you.

727
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:46,780
The commander is coming to inspect us.

728
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,570
Give me a hundred times more energy.

729
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:48,300
What should we do?

730
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:49,420
I'll find you then.

731
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,090
What are you afraid of?

732
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:50,540
It's still a loose one.

733
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,660
You didn't make a mistake anyway.

734
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,540
Just train carefully and you'll be done.

735
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,900
The knowledge of battlefield rescue

736
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:00,250
mainly includes hemostasis and dressing.

737
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,180
Next class,

738
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,700
we'll stick to the group we divided just now.

739
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,140
Do your own exercises.

740
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,250
dismiss a class

741
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:32,610
Zhuang Qian

742
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,610
I have a problem with your grouping.

743
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,370
What's wrong?

744
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:38,900
I don't want to be with Li Sisi.

745
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:40,660
I want to team up with Xu Dongdong.

746
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:41,900
And me.

747
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,570
Why?

748
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,250
Li Sisi knows nothing.

749
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,450
Almost killed people.

750
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,940
I'm not going with her.

751
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:49,970
Tong Mengyao

752
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:50,970
is almost done.

753
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,450
Grouping unchanged

754
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,820
Zhuang Qian

755
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,210
Tong Mengyao,

756
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,180
don't blame me.

757
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:00,700
No, I can learn.

758
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,180
It was you who almost had an accident.

759
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,540
How dare you speak here?

760
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,780
Have a little self-knowledge, will you?

761
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:08,300
Otherwise,

762
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:08,900
Tong Mengyao,

763
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:12,180
why are you always targeting Sisi?

764
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,540
Nothing personal about her.

765
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,300
I just hope that the backward comrades.

766
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:17,820
You can keep up with us as soon as possible.

767
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:19,730
But what you did was too extreme.

768
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:20,250
Think about her.

769
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:20,850
Ning Meng

770
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,850
I don't mind if you take sides with her.

771
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:25,730
But don't ask everyone to be like you.

772
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,570
Li Sisi,

773
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,730
you really don't fit to stay in Blue Lightning.

774
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,090
Why don't you just go by yourself.

775
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:33,250
Don't drag us down.

776
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,370
What's wrong with me?

777
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:38,730
Come on

778
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,210
Let me analyze it

779
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,850
for you. You can't do it physically.

780
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,250
I won't help you either.

781
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:45,060
What can you do with something like that?

782
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,180
Don't go too far.

783
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,090
What's wrong?

784
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,140
You have to stand up for her

785
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:48,740
Yes

786
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:49,810
Why do you think so?

787
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:51,090
I'm better than you

788
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,090
Ning Meng

789
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:54,260
You're so good at playing.

790
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,500
If you have the ability to compete,

791
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,220
you can compete

792
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,660
Ning Meng

793
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:59,460
Do you really want to compete with them?

794
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:00,570
Don't worry.

795
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,140
It's okay.

796
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,740
If you two lose,

797
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:07,330
you must apologize to Li Sisi.

798
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,530
And in front of everyone.

799
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:10,810
Fine

800
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,740
No problem,

801
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,500
but if you lose,

802
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:14,940
where will you see me later?

803
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,290
Salute me.

804
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:18,370
Okay

805
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,850
I represent Sisi alone.

806
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,370
Compared to the two of you.

807
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,090
That's what you said.

808
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,090
Don't say we bully you.

809
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:30,220
No

810
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:31,260
Okay

811
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:33,570
We mixed martial arts as we climbed over the obstacle.

812
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,290
Who will climb over all obstacles first?

813
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:36,660
Grab the red flag at the end

814
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,140
and let's

815
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:39,770
get started.

816
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,260
Forget it.

817
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,500
Don't let me influence you.

818
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,290
No

819
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,770
They have to apologize to you.

820
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,810
The two of us versus the one of you.

821
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,500
Don't be afraid.

822
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,420
It's not fair.

823
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,330
Don't worry.

824
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:53,740
I know what to do.

825
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:54,500
Ning Meng

826
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,290
Don't be a pussy

827
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:57,700
Sisi

828
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,420
Then you'll stand by and time it.

829
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:01,610
Let's see how I can beat them.

830
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:02,260
Okay

831
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:07,610
Ready

832
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,050
Start

833
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:19,900
Ning Meng, come on.

834
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:48,900
What are you looking at?

835
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,570
Kick it if you don't see it clearly.

836
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:50,260
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

837
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:50,940
Why don't you chase her?

838
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:51,660
Go after him

839
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,330
Ning Meng, come on.

840
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,050
Ning Meng, come on.

841
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,570
Ning Meng, come on.

842
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,090
Fighting! Fighting!

843
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,050
Ning Meng, you win.

844
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:13,700
You lost.

845
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,850
I don't need to remind you what to do.

846
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:18,460
I'm willing to admit defeat.

847
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:20,290
Let's find a crowded place now.

848
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,290
Apologize to both of you.

849
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,140
No,

850
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,420
just don't look for me everywhere in the future.

851
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:29,220
Are your feet okay?

852
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:30,290
It's okay

853
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,010
What about the soldiers I recommended to you?

854
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,370
One against two wins.

855
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:46,010
Yes, yes, yes.

856
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,940
The detachment leader has a discerning eye.

857
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,420
You have a good eye.

858
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,660
That's because you trained well.

859
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:53,770
These soldiers.

860
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,900
You have a strong sense of fighting.

861
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,420
We're still fighting in private.

862
00:39:59,050 --> 00:39:59,500
Okay

863
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:20,940
Dongdong

864
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,370
Yang Shu.

865
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:27,900
He won the gold medal

866
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,980
in shooting for the national team.

867
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:30,260
Participated in several major missions.

868
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,140
You don't look people in the eye.

869
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,220
People like her don't have friends.

870
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,050
It's such a shame today.

871
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,500
I'm the one who dragged you down.

872
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,010
You're still a land tank.

873
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,740
We should work hard.

874
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:48,940
We must surpass her.

875
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,500
Again.

876
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:54,090
Ning Meng won't be able to stay.

877
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,660
I don't think the captain is going to keep her either.

878
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,530
That's best.

879
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,180
But seriously,

880
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,260
captain, I really don't have time to talk to her these two days.

881
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:01,530
Why?

882
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:03,770
Because the commander of the corps is coming to inspect.

883
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:05,980
The detachment attaches great importance to this matter.

884
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,370
I'll bet you.

885
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:09,900
The commander will definitely not come.

886
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,900
You're not the commander.

887
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,660
How do you know?

888
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,290
I just know.

889
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,090
Sure, Demon Child.

890
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,900
What's the secret you won't tell me?

891
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:19,610
Tell me.

892
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:19,900
Hurry up

893
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:20,420
What?

894
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:21,500
My name is Demon Child.

895
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,370
I don't know anything.

896
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:22,770
Practice first

897
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:23,500
Let's talk about it after practice.

898
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:29,370
Ning Meng

899
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,010
Thank you.

900
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,530
Why are you thanking me?

901
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,740
Without your help.

902
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:36,700
I don't even know.

903
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,330
It's like being run by them.

904
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,770
You have to be brave.

905
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,370
The more you step back,

906
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,700
the more they bully you.

907
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:47,460
Do you know

908
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,900
why I like Blue Buff so much?

909
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,260
Isn't it because of your brother?

910
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:54,570
That's one reason.

911
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,460
There's another reason.

912
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,940
I know a comrade-in-arms like you.

913
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,740
Don't comfort me.

914
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,770
I'll only hold you back.

915
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,740
How can you be so insecure?

916
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:06,940
You have to know.

917
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,220
On you.

918
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:10,330
There is something stronger than others.

919
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:12,940
but

920
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:13,570
No buts.

921
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,370
Actually, you're smart.

922
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,220
You're brave, too.

923
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:17,940
Think about it carefully.

924
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:20,180
Why have so many people left

925
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,220
since Blue Lightning's selection?

926
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:24,900
But you've persisted until now.

927
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:26,810
Battalion Chief and Captain.

928
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,140
They all agree with you.

929
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:30,700
Don't always think you can't do it.

930
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:34,900
Let me tell you a rule.

931
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:36,740
In a group?

932
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:39,050
The most unknown person.

933
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,660
It's often the best.

934
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,500
Dress up as a pig and eat a tiger.

935
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:45,420
Have you heard of it?

936
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:49,180
Dress up as a pig and eat a tiger.

937
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:51,420
You hate me

938
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,460
You are the pig.

939
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:57,370
Li Sisi

940
00:42:57,810 --> 00:42:58,770
Come on

941
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,940
Come on

942
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:02,500
Come on

943
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,850
You're the best.
