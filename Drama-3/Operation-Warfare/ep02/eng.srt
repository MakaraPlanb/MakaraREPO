1
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,110
Experts at the Global Energy Conference

2
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,520
will team up to study new energy technologies.

3
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,480
Once they work together,

4
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,560
our plan to monopolize the global market for new energy

5
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,590
will be nullified.

6
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,350
so

7
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,080
We must try to prevent the convocation of the conference.

8
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,350
At the same time, we should also step up

9
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,750
our search for Professor James's.

10
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,240
New energy research data

11
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,350
is available.

12
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,480
So that we can have all the wealth.

13
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,040
Yes

14
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:14,680
Boss

15
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,430
I hacked into it just now.

16
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,040
James Partners'computer.

17
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,160
Although the backup data is not here,

18
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,840
I found out that

19
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,390
James's partner is investigating

20
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,160
James's life.

21
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,680
Details of a bodyguard.

22
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,360
I was thinking.

23
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,270
Is it before the doctoral student?

24
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,840
Back up the data to the bodyguard.

25
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,840
That's why they investigated him.

26
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,070
Well

27
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,230
done. Tell Wu Jie the news right away.

28
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,360
What do you do?

29
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,470
I'm here to repair the line.

30
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,790
I heard your call just now.

31
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,590
What on earth do you do?

32
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,910
She's the queen of the dark net.

33
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,440
Speed is fast.

34
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,400
According to

35
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,440
what James's partner found.

36
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,040
I found James's bodyguard.

37
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,550
Hack into his phone.

38
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,360
He changed his name when he found out

39
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,480
what happened to the doctor.

40
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,710
And change his address frequently.

41
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,120
This is his current address.

42
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,680
Check it at this address right now.

43
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,230
I'll find a good helper for you.

44
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:53,960
Help you.

45
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,480
Be careful.

46
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,320
Don't be as sleepy

47
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,960
as you were two years ago?

48
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,400
Do you really want to sleep?

49
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,790
Warm bed.

50
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,350
A loose pillow

51
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:58,920
It's over

52
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,710
Today's training.

53
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,680
It won't end so soon.

54
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,510
How comfortable!

55
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,680
what a Thanos.

56
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,870
I heard

57
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,070
his code name in the army.

58
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,510
It's Thanos.

59
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,990
As one's name suggests.

60
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,840
Come on

61
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,560
I'll let someone refresh you.

62
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,710
Are you still sleepy?

63
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,040
Within three minutes.

64
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,280
You can't escape from the woods.

65
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,510
Can't get in front of me.

66
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,510
All of them will be eliminated.

67
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,510
Go

68
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,840
That's what the captain asked for.

69
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,560
Twenty seconds to go.

70
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,440
People who can't get to me.

71
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,960
I'm about to be eliminated.

72
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,070
There's only one second left.

73
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,120
You're the last one.

74
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:41,560
Captain

75
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,680
I have a stomachache.

76
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,350
I want to go to the toilet.

77
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,470
Sure.

78
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,510
Go back to the army. I

79
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,190
won't go there.

80
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,230
Look, you're all so tired.

81
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,720
I'll give you a snack.

82
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:13,840
gather

83
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,840
Attention!

84
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,190
Five kilometers cross-country at night.

85
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,750
Turn right.

86
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,670
How about

87
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,430
running?

88
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,070
There's nothing wrong with you.

89
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,870
Is it too much psychological pressure?

90
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,960
Stomach cramps

91
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,800
and constant sweating.

92
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,070
I want to go to the toilet frequently.

93
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,190
These are all

94
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,600
externalizations of psychological stress.

95
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,480
Why don't you

96
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,840
talk to an instructor?

97
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,550
She has studied psychology.

98
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,800
Maybe I can enlighten you.

99
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,600
Forget it.

100
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,840
I just want to train well now.

101
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,070
Stay in Blue Lightning.

102
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,840
The top 14 are on my right.

103
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,990
The last 14 are on my left.

104
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,670
Everybody stand up straight.

105
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,600
Today's test.

106
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,510
The top 14 students

107
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,160
have food to eat.

108
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,240
The rest of you watched.

109
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:04,870
start a meal

110
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,960
Yes

111
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:18,040
This steamed stuffed bun smells really good.

112
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,840
Everyone I see now looks like a steamed stuffed bun.

113
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,800
Put away your sympathy.

114
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:05,670
On the battlefield.

115
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,600
The flood of sympathy has no value at all.

116
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:08,840
Stop eating.

117
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:10,550
now

118
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,510
There are no team members to eat.

119
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,800
Carry the players who have eaten and run five laps.

120
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,070
Yes

121
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,670
Come on

122
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,990
Fighting! Fighting!

123
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,110
Hold on

124
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,480
Come on

125
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,720
Come on! Go for it!

126
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,360
Hurry up

127
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,510
Come on, come on, let's go!

128
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:35,800
Rush up!

129
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,070
Come on

130
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,280
Come on

131
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,070
Come on

132
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,190
Rush up, rush up!

133
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,670
Hold on

134
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,430
Achievement is up to standard

135
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,160
Ning Meng

136
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,720
Do you have a stomachache?

137
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:51,480
It's okay

138
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,670
Don't worry about me.

139
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,630
Keep running.

140
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,280
I'm dying.

141
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,070
No

142
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,510
You have to

143
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,920
hold on. We have to.

144
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:00,630
Go to the finish line.

145
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,240
Ning Meng

146
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,310
How are you?

147
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,630
Why are you bleeding?

148
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,310
I'm fine.

149
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,670
60 seconds to go.

150
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,480
If you fail, you will be eliminated.

151
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,160
Hurry up!

152
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,600
I really can't walk.

153
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:31,990
I'm bored.

154
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,070
Stand up, Li Sisi.

155
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,720
I can't walk anymore.

156
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:36,920
Li Sisi, look at me.

157
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:43,630
Do you still remember

158
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,960
why you came to Blue Lightning?

159
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,190
Ning Meng

160
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,840
Don't hold on.

161
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,670
Your head is bleeding.

162
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,920
You have to dress it up.

163
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:54,720
I'm fine.

164
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:55,920
Stop dawdling.

165
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:56,990
Don't dawdle any longer.

166
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:57,840
We really.

167
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,870
I'm going to say goodbye to this place.

168
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,110
We have to stay.

169
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,280
You can give up now.

170
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,070
But as long as you give up,

171
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,750
you will be looked down upon by others.

172
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,870
What I hate most

173
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,190
is being looked down upon by others.

174
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,400
So I'll just fuck off.

175
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,800
We have to climb to the finish line.

176
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,800
I won't give up.

177
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,750
I won't be looked down upon.

178
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,480
Okay

179
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,630
Spell it out

180
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,430
Spell it out

181
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,990
The last 15 seconds.

182
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,280
Hurry up.

183
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,400
Come on, I can do it.

184
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,400
Hurry up! Hurry up!

185
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,600
Rush up!

186
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,480
Achievement is up to standard

187
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,480
qualified

188
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,840
Thank you, Ning Meng.

189
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,920
For what?

190
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,920
I don't have the momentum you gave me.

191
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,600
This is my turn.

192
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,480
I'm sure I'll be eliminated.

193
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,280
Do you still have a headache?

194
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,430
It doesn't hurt anymore.

195
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,630
Can you tell me

196
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,840
how hard you tried to get into the Blue Lightning.

197
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,840
Is it because of something?

198
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,870
For the sake of my life.

199
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,160
The most important person.

200
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,720
Two years ago,

201
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,280
it was reported by public security authorities

202
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,480
that a group of terrorists

203
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,750
were carrying out terrorist activities.

204
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,040
Our superiors ordered us

205
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,920
to get to the scene quickly and take action.

206
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,550
James Theron

207
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,990
is a new energy technology

208
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,360
developed by French physicist

209
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,110
Dr. James.

210
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,280
Has been the target of a terrorist group.

211
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,430
It is one of the most advanced

212
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,960
new energy technologies in the world.

213
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,400
That's what they came for this time.

214
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,400
Follow the last clue.

215
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,110
Finally locked in this food processing plant.

216
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,550
I think it's a terrorist.

217
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:15,960
a makeshift den in disguise.

218
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,600
Hello, Mom.

219
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,670
Meng Meng

220
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,040
Did you get on the bus?

221
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,280
I just got on the bus.

222
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,400
But it's just me.

223
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,600
No, boys.

224
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,480
Didn't your brother pick you up?

225
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,360
No one answered his cell phone.

226
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,280
I was looking for him.

227
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,870
You promised to pick me up.

228
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,800
As a result, I can't even see a figure.

229
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,870
I waited for him at the airport

230
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,280
for over an hour.

231
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,430
So you came back by yourself?

232
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,790
Don't worry.

233
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,790
Didn't I leave on my own these years?

234
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,670
Then you have to be careful.

235
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:49,760
Right

236
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,190
I'll give it to you.

237
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,880
I bought everything you both like to eat.

238
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,720
Then we can have dinner when we come back.

239
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,430
That's right, that's right.

240
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,120
I forgot.

241
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,520
Where are you going first?

242
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,720
Sweep the tomb for your father.

243
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,880
Then come back for dinner.

244
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,310
I see.

245
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:03,840
His nickname

246
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:05,880
is Grass Wolf.

247
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,880
He is the No. 4 of the international terrorist organization S

248
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:10,880
Group.

249
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,190
Two years ago, this man.

250
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,600
Disappear

251
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,310
suddenly this time.

252
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,430
And kidnapped Dr. James. It

253
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,720
must have been directed at Dr. James.

254
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,790
New energy technologies are coming.

255
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,880
Based on the organization's past

256
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,190
terrorist practices,

257
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,840
our goal this time is

258
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:28,880
first

259
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,640
Do everything you can to save Dr. James.

260
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,240
second

261
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,840
Do everything you can

262
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,310
to stop them from getting data

263
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,520
on Dr. James's

264
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,550
new energy technology. Do you understand me?

265
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:40,190
Got it

266
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,880
Let's check the equipment one last time.

267
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,640
Sister. Sister.

268
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,310
I dropped my candy.

269
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,310
Sugar

270
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,030
Here you are.

271
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,960
Thank you, sister.

272
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,120
Good boy

273
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,360
Why is there no signal on the mobile phone?

274
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,840
No signal.

275
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,520
What's going on?

276
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,960
What's going on? Do you have a signal?

277
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,150
Follow this route.

278
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,840
Think of this car as yours.

279
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,310
Cut the crap and drive!

280
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,270
Everybody close the curtains.

281
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,910
Put your hands on the backrest in the front row.

282
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:52,310
Hurry up!

283
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,760
I'm talking about you. Pull the curtains.

284
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,390
Put your cell phone inside.

285
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,840
Cell phone. Cell phone.

286
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,190
I asked you to take your phone.

287
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:02,760
Hurry up!

288
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:04,520
You

289
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,910
And you, hurry up.

290
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,790
Hurry up! Hurry up!

291
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,150
Yours

292
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:10,880
cell phone

293
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,150
Your phone.

294
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:15,790
Your phone.

295
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,390
Give me your phone.

296
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:19,760
Give me your phone.

297
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,550
Hurry up!

298
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:24,840
Where's your phone?

299
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,150
Yours

300
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:28,840
Hurry up!

301
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:31,550
Give me your phone.

302
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:11,390
grass wolf

303
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,720
You can't get out of this building.

304
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,840
I advise you to abdicate your resistance.

305
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,480
You should know that

306
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,070
from the current situation,

307
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,760
you don't have any chance of winning.

308
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,550
In addition to surrender.

309
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,310
There's no way out.

310
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,000
Within five kilometers of Fiona Fang.

311
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,000
It's all

312
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,240
under our control.

313
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,150
Have you got everything?

314
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,880
Data on new energy sources.

315
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,670
It's all in here.

316
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,790
Don't think you have too many people and too many guns.

317
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,070
Surrounded me.

318
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,600
I can't leave.

319
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,790
Don't be naive, okay?

320
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,070
How many soldiers?

321
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,550
You still want to fight with me?

322
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,390
Let me tell you.

323
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,120
There are less than five minutes left.

324
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,520
You will beg me.

325
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,760
Stop dreaming.

326
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,760
Surrender quickly.

327
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,030
Or I'll annihilate you all

328
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,150
in five minutes.

329
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,880
You scared me to death.

330
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,640
Attention, all.

331
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,150
Let's take care of the periphery first.

332
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,520
Let's take care of the periphery first.

333
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,120
Yes

334
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,120
Everyone must be more careful.

335
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,480
We were almost separated from each other by yin and yang.

336
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:21,910
Shut your mouth.

337
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,000
Don't talk nonsense.

338
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,000
Focus.

339
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:27,910
Captain

340
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,520
There is only one door opposite.

341
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,070
The terrain is unfavorable to us.

342
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,520
It's not appropriate

343
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,640
to storm. I have an idea.

344
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,390
Attention, all.

345
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,030
Prepare a detonation bomb.

346
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,000
Captain Ning Lei.

347
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,000
Speak

348
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,430
I'm Chen Tao, commander of criminal investigation of Yanzhou detachment.

349
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,150
A bus had been driven through the barricades.

350
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:50,760
I'm heading for you.

351
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,480
Reconnaissance team,

352
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,000
report the bus condition.

353
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,430
The curtains were closed on both sides.

354
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,150
Only the front and rear windshields have visibility.

355
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,360
But the light is too dim.

356
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,790
I can't see the inside of the car clearly.

357
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,550
Visual inspection showed that no one was moving.

358
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,240
The location of the terrorists and the number of them could not be determined.

359
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,840
Attention, teams.

360
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,030
Stand by until we know

361
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,150
if there are any hostages

362
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,390
in the bus.

363
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,190
This is going to be a lively event.

364
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,670
The foxes upstairs.

365
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,910
Be too timid to reply.

366
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,790
I ordered takeout.

367
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,190
It's not takeout.

368
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,480
This is dinner.

369
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,000
Squadron leader,

370
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,150
there are hostages in the car.

371
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,270
And there are gunmen.

372
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,720
What are the chances of being killed with one shot?

373
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,360
The windshield has also been closed.

374
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,070
I can't see.

375
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,360
Keep watching.

376
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,360
Yes

377
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:51,960
Squadron Leader,

378
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,520
we found a signal shielding device

379
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,070
on the bus. Do whatever it takes

380
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,270
to remove the interference as soon as possible.

381
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,240
What are you doing?

382
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,120
Captain! Captain!

383
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,430
The hostages in the car are in danger.

384
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,360
Be honest.

385
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,360
Everybody be honest.

386
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,760
Or you'll be the next one to die.

387
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,430
Calm down

388
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:36,760
Be sure to calm down.

389
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,030
We'll figure something out.

390
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:41,390
Bastard!

391
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,760
grass wolf

392
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,640
I'm the squadron leader of the special operations team.

393
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,840
My name is Ning Lei.

394
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,480
Just reply if you hear me.

395
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,840
I just said it.

396
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,030
Within five minutes.

397
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,910
I'm sure you'll beg me.

398
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,150
I'm not begging you now.

399
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,520
I'm negotiating with you.

400
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,120
So you were soldiers.

401
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,030
Call me a negotiator.

402
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,550
I'm not modest to tell you.

403
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,840
I want to take care of you.

404
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,310
It only takes 60 seconds.

405
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,070
Let me tell you one more thing.

406
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,030
The man you were trying to save, Dr. James,

407
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:19,880
is dead.

408
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,760
I have the data.

409
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,760
And we will

410
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,880
leave here soon.

411
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,430
The bus.

412
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,240
Is it a tool that you want to leave?

413
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:29,910
exactly

414
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:32,000
Let me remind you.

415
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,000
From Yuan'an to here.

416
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,390
This bus of yours.

417
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,310
I haven't been in the service area once.

418
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:40,880
I haven't refueled it once.

419
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,520
Even if I let you go,

420
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,840
how far can you go?

421
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,840
So what do you mean?

422
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,360
Let's make an exchange.

423
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,190
I'll fill up the tank for you.

424
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,070
Hand over the old man

425
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,000
and the child in the car.

426
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,760
Get your men out of here first.

427
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,910
Let me get in the car first.

428
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,030
Otherwise, nothing can be said.

429
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,030
Let our people go.

430
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,670
Or I'll kill him.

431
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,070
Captain, the hostages are under threat.

432
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:14,840
What do you think?

433
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,520
Have you made up your mind?

434
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,240
Call for air support.

435
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,030
Please set up a roadblock

436
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,030
at the intersection of the pre-determined route

437
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:25,760
for the withdrawal of terrorists.

438
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,640
Attention, all.

439
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,150
Get out of the building.

440
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,480
Wait for the next instruction.

441
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,070
Get everyone in the back.

442
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:57,520
Let's go

443
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:57,760
Let's go

444
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,150
Hurry up!

445
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,720
Let's go! Hurry up!

446
00:28:58,790 --> 00:28:59,480
Get up! Let's go!

447
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,120
Get up! Hurry up!

448
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:00,640
Hurry up!

449
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:00,880
Let's go

450
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:01,150
Hurry up

451
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:01,790
Let's go!

452
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:02,520
Let's go

453
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,150
Go back.

454
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:03,520
Let's go

455
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:04,880
Let's go!

456
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,790
I'm Ning Lei.

457
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:51,240
To fulfill our negotiation just now.

458
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:02,790
grass wolf

459
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,270
Are you ready?

460
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,070
The end result

461
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,640
is to fill up the oil.

462
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,240
I'll give you three hostages.

463
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,240
You,

464
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,390
you and you

465
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,520
Get off

466
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,270
Come towards me.

467
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,390
Don't panic.

468
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:25,600
Yes

469
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,390
Come here

470
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,310
You're safe now.

471
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,390
What are you doing?

472
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,760
Can you let the little girl go first?

473
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,030
You came back in exchange for that child?

474
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,360
Is that okay?

475
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,270
Aren't you afraid of death?

476
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:00,790
Yes

477
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,390
Give me a reason why you changed.

478
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,880
She is too young.

479
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,070
I'm just a kid.

480
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,760
Get out of the car.

481
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,120
Hurry up!

482
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,270
Didn't we agree to let the children go?

483
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,240
You'll die if you talk too much.

484
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:30,640
Get down!

485
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,030
Why did the girl go back?

486
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,310
That's my sister.

487
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,480
Your sister?

488
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,190
Your sister, why did you ask her to go back?

489
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,670
I just gave her a gesture.

490
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,030
I asked her to go back.

491
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,000
She also gave me a gesture.

492
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:01,670
She said she had a cell phone.

493
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,270
When I was young.

494
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,760
Every time we make a mistake,

495
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,270
that's what we do.

496
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,880
They gave each other a secret code.

497
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,240
What are you fooling around with?

498
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:27,360
Be honest.

499
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,480
Report

500
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,910
The shielding signal inside the car has been cracked.

501
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,240
And found

502
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,310
a cell phone in the car.

503
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,150
It's on. The last number

504
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,150
is 3185.

505
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,430
This is my sister's mobile phone number.

506
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:48,550
Give her a message.

507
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:49,910
Just say it

508
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:51,910
Get to know what's going on in the car.

509
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:52,720
Yes

510
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,520
Listen up, guys who do your best.

511
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,720
Try to delay the time.

512
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:57,760
Brother

513
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,270
It's too risky.

514
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,240
You don't have to remind me.

515
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,240
He took his own sister hostage.

516
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,360
Ning Lei is the only one who can do this.

517
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,240
What's wrong with these people?

518
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,720
It's so slow to fill up the gas.

519
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:19,720
Report

520
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,760
Message from the car.

521
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:21,910
Eight gangsters.

522
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:22,480
Zhongyi

523
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:22,840
The latter one

524
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:23,310
They all have guns.

525
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,270
Hostage 12

526
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:24,640
old and young

527
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:25,760
Open the skylight.

528
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,760
The situation is complicated.

529
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,550
Once we storm the hostages,

530
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,520
we can't protect them.

531
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,310
Send a message back to my sister.

532
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,270
Ask her

533
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,670
Any suggestions to protect the hostages?

534
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:42,760
You

535
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,190
Close the curtain for me.

536
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,190
Gangsters are all in high positions.

537
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,030
I told the hostages to get down.

538
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,190
You shoot above the window.

539
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,760
to signal that the curtains had fallen.

540
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,240
If your sister joins the SWAT team.

541
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:13,960
He must be good at it.

542
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,000
Deploy it quickly.

543
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:15,550
Yes

544
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,670
Get down together later.

545
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:40,790
Hunian

546
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,960
We'll get down together later.

547
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,350
Get down!

548
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:55,560
Get down!

549
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,080
Me

550
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,320
I... I... I.

551
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,910
I'm getting old.

552
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,760
I can't hold it. I have to

553
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,040
go to the bathroom.

554
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:06,590
Sit down

555
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,040
If you move again, I'll kill you.

556
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:08,720
Be honest.

557
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,280
Everybody be honest.

558
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,590
Get down!

559
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,040
Get down!

560
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,320
shoot

561
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,280
Report to captain.

562
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,280
Scanning out an electronic device inside the car.

563
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,240
Activated. Could be a bomb.

564
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,670
Go save her.

565
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,590
There's a bomb in the car.

566
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,040
Hurry up

567
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,430
Get out of the car.

568
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:01,800
There's a bomb in the car.

569
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,390
Get out of the car.

570
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,150
Let's go.

571
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:05,800
Get out of the car.

572
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,110
Follow me

573
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,080
and hide behind the car.

574
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:25,870
Hurry up

575
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:26,670
Hurry up

576
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:31,350
Brother

577
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:32,280
Brother

578
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,480
Brother, how are you?

579
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:35,670
Come on

580
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:37,240
Come on

581
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:41,520
Brother

582
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,670
I'm proud of you.

583
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:51,110
We... We.

584
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,040
You've made meritorious service.

585
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,280
Brother

586
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,320
Brother

587
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,000
Brother

588
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:05,800
Brother

589
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:07,430
Brother

590
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,590
Brother

591
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,280
Brother

592
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:14,760
Brother

593
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,000
Brother

594
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,910
My mother was in a hurry.

595
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:21,560
I can't see.

596
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,520
So from the day I tried out,

597
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,000
I swore.

598
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,870
For my brother.

599
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,560
I must stay in Blue Power.

600
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,760
I'm sorry

601
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,240
to mention your sadness.

602
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,430
He used to tell me

603
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,800
he didn't want to be a heroic soldier.

604
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:49,520
Not a good soldier.

605
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,720
This sentence.

606
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,520
Always engraved in my heart.

607
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,590
I finally understand now.

608
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,110
Why do you have such a firm belief?

609
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,390
Thank you, Ning Meng.

610
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:04,800
From now on.

611
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,150
We have to go through

612
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:07,720
all kinds of difficulties and dangers.

613
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,080
Let's go together.

614
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,720
What happened this time.

615
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,240
I hired Jubao Group to do it.

616
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,280
But your method.

617
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,830
It's as bad as garbage.

618
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,240
But you are different.

619
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,190
Follow me so that you can develop.

620
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,350
Why me?

621
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,430
I have my reasons.

622
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:52,080
But you have no choice.

623
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:56,800
Everybody get up!

624
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,430
We'll hand out a wrist monitor

625
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,110
for each of you.

626
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:08,870
Enter your fingerprint.

627
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,800
You'll get

628
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:12,000
a different positioning coordinate.

629
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,910
Before two o'clock in the morning.

630
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,080
Must arrive at the specified coordinate position.

631
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,390
Find your own badges.

632
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:19,830
I can't find it.

633
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:20,670
die out

634
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,870
Yes

635
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:34,960
Is this for me?

636
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,190
Follow me

637
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,830
and you'll have more money to spend.

638
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:44,910
What mission?

639
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:55,560
Go to this position.

640
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,520
I won't leave any of them.

641
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,320
Kill them all.
