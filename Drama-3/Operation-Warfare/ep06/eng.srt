1
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,600
By the way, monitor.

2
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:47,960
Did you advance?

3
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,230
Jin.

4
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,640
Why didn't I hear your promotion announcement?

5
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,360
Ning Meng

6
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,470
Let's see which one of us is quick.

7
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,280
Come on, Yang Shu.

8
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,950
You've already done your job.

9
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,920
Leave the hostage

10
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,000
to your teammates who need it.

11
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,960
If you want it, you can take it with your own skills.

12
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,550
As soon as the hostages appeared,

13
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,440
I threw flash bombs at Ning Meng and others.

14
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,760
The last hostage is mine.

15
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,200
Everyone, pay attention.

16
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,390
There are still five minutes

17
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,270
before the end of the drill.

18
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,310
Now, everyone present,

19
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,390
whether or not they have succeeded in rescuing the hostages,

20
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,560
rush in!

21
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,910
Rescue the last hostage.

22
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,270
So many people took this hostage.

23
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,560
It's clear that Ning Meng is going to be eliminated.

24
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,310
It seems that Ning Meng

25
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,560
is really not the one the captain wants.

26
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,080
Stop!

27
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,270
Captain

28
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,880
Do you know why I wear sunglasses?

29
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,560
Because it's cool.

30
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,590
Because I'm afraid of that thing in your hand.

31
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,560
Blind my eyes.

32
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,800
Put it away.

33
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:28,440
Yes

34
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,160
Chinese armed police!

35
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,910
Freeze! Drop your weapon!

36
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:03,470
Chinese armed police,

37
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,350
lay down your arms!

38
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,110
Release the hostages.

39
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,040
Don't move!

40
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,680
Come again and I'll kill him.

41
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,470
One minute and 30 seconds left.

42
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,350
Climb behind the terrorists with your bare hands.

43
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,160
It will take a minute.

44
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,960
And then jump up to the rooftop.

45
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,600
From behind the terrorists.

46
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,750
Insert your finger into the trigger.

47
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:36,910
Stop the shooting.

48
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,350
And the success rate of subduing robbers.

49
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,470
85%.

50
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,400
I drew his attention.

51
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,080
Copy it from the back.

52
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,240
I'm warning you one last time.

53
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:00,910
This hostage is mine.

54
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,910
I'm telling you for the last time.

55
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,550
I don't make teammates with weak people.

56
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:05,550
Yang Shu

57
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,990
You're too unkind.

58
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,240
You've done your job.

59
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,990
Leave this opportunity to others.

60
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,880
What are you doing up here?

61
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,520
Didn't the captain call him up?

62
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,190
Stay back!

63
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:37,960
Stay back!

64
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,550
Come and beat him to death.

65
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,960
Execute Plan B.

66
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:03,800
Roger that

67
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,680
Thirty seconds to go.

68
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,190
Ten seconds to go.

69
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,560
Hold me.

70
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,150
commander,

71
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,120
call an ambulance!

72
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,560
Yes

73
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,800
The moment he saw me fall.

74
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,280
Ning Meng

75
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,470
Captain knows.

76
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:34,870
Ning Meng

77
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,280
It's dangerous to pick it up with bare hands.

78
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,190
But he rushed up regardless of his safety.

79
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:39,680
Slow down

80
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:44,910
Slow down

81
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,310
Try to move.

82
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,030
Once a comrade-in-arms is in danger,

83
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,280
they will reach out to rescue him immediately.

84
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,630
Even at the expense of his own life.

85
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,190
I'll do whatever it takes.

86
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,080
This is a soldier.

87
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,030
Can you move?

88
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,720
I'm fine, Captain.

89
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:08,800
I'm fine.

90
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,190
Stand up

91
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:23,840
Captain

92
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,000
Captain, what happened to you?

93
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:25,800
I'm fine.

94
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:29,960
Captain

95
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,310
Come on, slow down.

96
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,960
What happened to you just now?

97
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,350
This is a drill.

98
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,030
The hostages were protected when they jumped down.

99
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,120
What protection do you have?

100
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,960
You'll fall to your death.

101
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:00,840
Report

102
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,470
My teammates are dragging me up there.

103
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,630
I thought

104
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,240
you said on the battlefield.

105
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,190
You should trust your life

106
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,080
to your comrades in arms.

107
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,590
I trust them.

108
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,720
Who could have grabbed you just now?

109
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,720
Your comrade-in-arms has been shot and killed.

110
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,910
If you're on the battlefield,

111
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,720
do you expect

112
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,030
the corpses of your comrades to hold you?

113
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,080
Then I'm going to press forward even more.

114
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,870
His comrades died.

115
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,910
I have to be determined to complete the task.

116
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,310
Captain

117
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,280
Didn't you say the mission comes first?

118
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,120
We have to be not afraid of sacrifice.

119
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,120
Can we overcome all difficulties

120
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,150
to win the final victory?

121
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,280
The sacrifice must be worth something.

122
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,280
On the battlefield, we should pay attention to tactics and tactics.

123
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,720
Not brute force and impulse.

124
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,190
You can only lead to the sacrifice of innocent people.

125
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,310
But I still finished the task.

126
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,280
Because every shot I fired

127
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,960
was on a non-critical part of the hostage.

128
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,080
Strictly speaking,

129
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,910
I took the hostage who was forced

130
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,630
to suffer from Stockholm syndrome alive,

131
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,590
and I won.

132
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,310
Ning Meng got into the ambulance.

133
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,840
It looks like he's going to be punished.

134
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,310
terrorists and hostages.

135
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,230
It's all done by Ning Meng.

136
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,230
Why should I punish her?

137
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,870
I think some people.

138
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,990
Should be punished.

139
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:26,870
Guo Xiaowei,

140
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,310
I'm

141
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:28,990
sorry.

142
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:29,920
Don't talk to me.

143
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:32,870
Have you forgotten?

144
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,920
I've already been killed by you.

145
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,870
Don't be angry.

146
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,520
I really didn't mean it.

147
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,080
Yes

148
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,400
You didn't mean it.

149
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,080
I did it on purpose.

150
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,840
You're trying to kill her.

151
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,400
This is the first time I've seen her.

152
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,960
We can't handle the terrorists.

153
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,790
It's enough to take his teammates

154
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,790
as my head.

155
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,670
Don't say a few words.

156
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,480
It's not the first time I've been shot in the head.

157
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,190
Yes

158
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,280
But it's my first time to get shot in the head

159
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,750
by a teammate. You just jumped off the building.

160
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,990
It scared me to death.

161
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,520
This is a drill.

162
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,870
Why are you so desperate?

163
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,790
I'll accept any punishment.

164
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,790
Anyway, I finished the task.

165
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,840
He has no reason not to let me stay in Blue Lightning.

166
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,480
But you smashed him

167
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,360
when you jumped down.

168
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,600
We still don't know what the consequences will be.

169
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,400
Hold on.

170
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,750
I'll wrap it up for you.

171
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,630
It didn't hurt the bone,

172
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,280
but the ligaments and muscle tissue

173
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,360
were too badly damaged.

174
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,550
Go back to the infirmary for treatment.

175
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,790
Is that how doctors scare their patients?

176
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,870
Doctors only tell patients

177
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,870
the worst-case scenario.

178
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,520
That means

179
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:55,750
the result is OK.

180
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,280
Hang in there

181
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,230
and talk about it.

182
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,920
Today's test was wonderful.

183
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,190
He cheated.

184
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,430
There's internal strife.

185
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,790
There is malicious competition.

186
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,080
And accidentally injured a comrade-in-arms.

187
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,080
You've really taught me a lot.

188
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,630
Our mission.

189
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,870
What's the ultimate goal?

190
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,600
Rescue the hostages.

191
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,430
Killing terrorists.

192
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,110
You know,

193
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,750
but how did you do it?

194
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,790
Is it fun to rob terrorists?

195
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,870
He doesn't care about the hostages.

196
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,430
There were even people.

197
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,040
Killed his own comrade in arms.

198
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:57,990
What's it like to kill a comrade-in-arms?

199
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:58,960
Report

200
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,190
It's Guo Xiaowei.

201
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,920
Suddenly appeared behind the terrorists.

202
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,630
The terrorists fired again.

203
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,990
To appear such a situation.

204
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,160
It was an accident.

205
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:06,960
accident

206
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,840
There was no accident with the bullets fired.

207
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,600
If it was live ammunition,

208
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,280
your comrade-in-arms Guo Xiaowei

209
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,430
would have died an hour ago.

210
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,310
Me

211
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,280
I didn't know hostages were gonna shoot.

212
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,670
What do you know?

213
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,960
Ever heard of the Stockholm effect?

214
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,840
What does reconnaissance do for a living?

215
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:24,670
You don't have to figure out the situation

216
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,600
if you simulate actual combat?

217
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,110
Say something!

218
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,110
Report

219
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,190

00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:33,990
Yes

221
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,790
Tong Mengyao, send you the computer.

222
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,110
It's to let you use your special skills in the exercise.

223
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,630
I'm not asking you to help people cheat.

224
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,990
Be opportunistic and clever.

225
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,280
Punish you to go back and write an in-depth examination.

226
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,920
If the inspection is not profound, leave Blue Lightning immediately.

227
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,750
Liang Weili, Ma Fanghong, Lin Bin,

228
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,110

dequeue

231
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,550
Yes

232
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,110
Turn left.

233
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,080
Isn't it past the time

234
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,190
for the monitor to run away?

235
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,630
He told me he was promoted.

236
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,080
Stand!

237
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:06,990
Turn right.

238
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,080
You didn't complete the task.

239
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,400
die out

240
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,230
Go to the name wall.

241
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,720
Tear off your names with your own hands.

242
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,160
Say goodbye to everyone.

243
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,750
Yes

244
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:35,840
class monitor

245
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,960
Monitor, you lied to me.

246
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,670
Turn right.

247
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,920
Run, go

248
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,160
class monitor

249
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,550
Report to captain.

250
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,750
Report to the instructor

251
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,080
that I can't leave.

252
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:35,720
reason

253
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,720
My squadron.

254
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,230
Stationed in the harsh mountains.

255
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,750
I heard that I'm going to try out for Blue Lightning.

256
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,430
They are all excited as if they were celebrating the New Year.

257
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,790
I'm their pride.

258
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,670
I can't let them down.

259
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,360
The Blue Lightning Commando has chosen you.

260
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,400
It's the pride of our entire squadron.

261
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,870
Go over there and do a good job.

262
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,310
I'm free.

263
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,110
He often comes to see our comrades in the mountains.

264
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:09,920
Don't forget us. Yes,

265
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,110
platoon leader.

266
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,990
I've been thinking about words of encouragement all night.

267
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,360
I can't say anything now.

268
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,310
Let's propose a toast to you.

269
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,310
Both

270
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,310
Salute!

271
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,280
Captain

272
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,960
I beg you.

273
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,110
Don't kick me out.

274
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:34,840
It's my fault.

275
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,310
But I'm really willing to correct it.

276
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,670
Please give me another chance.

277
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,960
I did.

278
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,720
The hope of all of them.

279
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,720
I really can't just leave.

280
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,310
I'm going back like this.

281
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,360
How shameful I am!

282
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:50,920
Liang Weili

283
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,870
can't stand up.

284
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,230
Do you want to leave too?

285
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,840
Why don't you think about it again?

286
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,870
Thank you for your support to Blue Lightning.

287
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,190
I'm touched.

288
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,400
I understand.

289
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,360
But rules are rules.

290
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:24,720
I won't change.

291
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:25,960
It can't be changed.

292
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,360
Crying won't solve anything.

293
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,080
It will only make me look down on you.

294
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:34,630
Execute the command.

295
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,230
Yes

296
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,390
Attention!

297
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,390
dress right。 .

298
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,790
Look forward

299
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,080
and salute!

300
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,270
I want you to remember

301
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,960
why you tried so hard?

302
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,600
Leave your name on this wall.

303
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,240
I hope that in the future,

304
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,790
no matter what difficulties

305
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,190
and challenges you encounter?

306
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,120
Will remember.

307
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,600
At this moment, facing this wall,

308
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,670
the emotion surging in your heart

309
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:33,910
is that

310
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,030
your initial intention as armed police soldiers

311
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,910
is better than the guns in your hands.

312
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,510
A more powerful weapon.

313
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,190
Listening to the Party's command

314
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,720
can win a battle.

315
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,310
Good style.

316
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,720
Who are we?

317
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,080
Blue Lightning Commando

318
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,430
uses me in the first battle.

319
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,190
Use me to win.

320
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,670
Use me to win.

321
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,240
Who are we?

322
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,600
Blue Lightning Commando

323
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,960
uses me in the first battle.

324
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,270
Use me to win.

325
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,960
Liang Weili is leaving.

326
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,190
What a pity.

327
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:26,790
Yes

328
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,030
I didn't expect to leave so soon.

329
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,030
You two are here.

330
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:29,510
Do me a favor.

331
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,430
You tell me,

332
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,840
as long as I can do it.

333
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,080
What about me?

334
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,480
Ordered a takeaway.

335
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,030
I need you to hold it for me.

336
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,430
How dare you order takeout?

337
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,720
If the captain finds out

338
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,030
Well

339
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,190
I have nothing else to do.

340
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,760
Have you expressed my apologies to Liang Weili?

341
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,790
What I said to her earlier.

342
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,240
It's a little too muddy.

343
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,760
Now she's leaving.

344
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,000
Even if I get punished, I'll admit it.

345
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,510
Come on, don't dawdle.

346
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,120
Let's go! Let's go!

347
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:53,760
This way,

348
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,720
is there really no camera here?

349
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,600
Don't worry.

350
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,310
The surveillance corner of our camp is here.

351
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:05,840
No problem.

352
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,960
Hurry up!

353
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,430
I'm in a hurry to send the next order.

354
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,080
Who's in charge of delaying business?

355
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:11,430
Dude,

356
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,390
keep your voice down.

357
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,390
What's the rush?

358
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,910
I'll give you a five-star rating later.

359
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,640
Hold on, you two

360
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,000
Fine

361
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,270
Three, two, one.

362
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,000
What are you doing?

363
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:27,480
Me

364
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,120
Which unit are you from?

365
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,000
Report

366
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:34,790
Blue Lightning,

367
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,080
what are you doing here?

368
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,640
class monitor

369
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,910
I... I... Let's take that.

370
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:41,510
Take that.

371
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,000
Let's get ready.

372
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,270
Treat male soldiers as criminals

373
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:44,880
Yes

374
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,480
Study the actual combat tactics of escaping.

375
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:46,880
Yes

376
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:47,550
We're practicing tactics. Yes, yes.

377
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,310
We're working on tactics.

378
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,550
When studying tactics, we should also pay attention to police appearance and discipline.

379
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:52,510
put on

380
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:53,790
Yes

381
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,270
Thank you for your concern.

382
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,510
Thank you for your concern.

383
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,270
Take care, monitor.

384
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,120
Ning Meng

385
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,670
Your reaction is too fast.

386
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,720
I almost said it.

387
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,480
Hurry up.

388
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,640
Don't picket for a while.

389
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,030
I'm ready.

390
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,150
Three, two, one, go.

391
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,550
Be careful,

392
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:22,480
buddy. Here,

393
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,030
here, here.

394
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,190
Brother

395
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,190
It's so hard. Is there any electricity

396
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,240
on this network?

397
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,030
What nonsense are you talking about?

398
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,510
Can I do this without electricity?

399
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,270
Cut the crap.

400
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:31,550
Hurry up!

401
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,670
Please wait a moment.

402
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:35,880
Qin.

403
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,390
It's a drill.

404
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,910
Destroy my six drones.

405
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,670
Do I have to report it?

406
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,000
Staff Officer Zhang.

407
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,910
Train a good soldier.

408
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,080
Break some common equipment.

409
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,960
Isn't it all worth it?

410
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,760
Is that necessary?

411
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,600
This soldier is actually very flexible.

412
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,080
Proceed from actual combat.

413
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,310
Unmanned aerial vehicles should be shot down

414
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,150
when they are controlled by others.

415
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,390
He's a good soldier.

416
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,600
You have a strong sense of protection against electricity.

417
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,510
That's right

418
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:08,600
Guo Xiaowei,

419
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:09,760
stop being so mean.

420
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,240
Hurry up!

421
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,430
Hurry up.

422
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,360
I see.

423
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,480
Look at this soldier.

424
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,190
Look

425
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,150
Riding a fence across the grid to pick up takeout.

426
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,030
Qin

427
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,030
Come and have a look.

428
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,030
Come on.

429
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,510
Who is it?

430
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,840
That's too bold.

431
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,000
Tong Mengyao?

432
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,510
I'm warning you,

433
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,310
don't take this thing.

434
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,430
Show off in front of my eyes.

435
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,790
I won't pay you if I break it.

436
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:45,150
This soldier looks familiar to me.

437
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:46,960
Do you know him?

438
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,270
You think they ordered takeout?

439
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,190
Do you eat it yourself?

440
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,030
Maybe

441
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,600
it's you, the captain.

442
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,790
It's part of the training.

443
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,790
You provide them with equipment.

444
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,310
They were grateful.

445
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,640
That doesn't mean it.

446
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,190
You ordered it for me.

447
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,480
Of course,

448
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,760
it doesn't look like

449
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,190
it. Look

450
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,240
how hard it is to get a takeaway.

451
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:17,960
Forget it

452
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,510
I'll go get it for you myself.

453
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,000
Eat something before you go.

454
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:41,790
Are you done?

455
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,270
Tong Mengyao,

456
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,150
the three of us are sincere.

457
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,190
You want to see Liang Weili off?

458
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,030
Thank you

459
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:49,550
for your kindness. I appreciate it.

460
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,390
The three of you.

461
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,760
Stop pretending to be a nice guy.

462
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,640
Li Sisi,

463
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:53,960
your military skills are so poor.

464
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,910
How can you stay in Blue Lightning

465
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:55,960
Tong Meng Yao What are you talking about?

466
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,480
Ning Meng

467
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,790
If Guo Xiaowei hadn't helped you,

468
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,960
you might have been eliminated.

469
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,790
Don't you know?

470
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:00,960
Stop it.

471
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,670
It's all in the past.

472
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,360
This

473
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,640
Think of it as our farewell dinner.

474
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,000
Take it away. We won't eat it.

475
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,840
We won't eat.

476
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,760
Tong Mengyao, what are you doing?

477
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,270
What are you doing?

478
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:14,600
What's wrong?

479
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,270
Is it a big deal to go together?

480
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,240
Will you stop arguing?

481
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:17,510
Stop arguing.

482
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,190
I've figured it out.

483
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,000
I can only blame myself for not living up to expectations.

484
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,030
I can't blame anyone else.

485
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,000
I've known you guys

486
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,310
since I came here.

487
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,030
It's my biggest gain.

488
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:36,880
Go for it.

489
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:58,910
Hungry

490
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,960
Your stomach is so disappointing.

491
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,270
Hurry up and write your review.

492
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,720
I haven't eaten all day.

493
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,760
You haven't eaten yet.

494
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,240
Liang Weili didn't even eat boiled fish

495
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,360
when she left.

496
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,510
I sneered at him before I left.

497
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,120
Don't blame yourself.

498
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,960
It's not because of you that Liang Weili left.

499
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,240
What are you muttering about?

500
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,840
Don't write well and check.

501
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:36,960
For you.

502
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,880
I have to apologize to Staff Officer Zhang.

503
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,150
Don't eat until you finish writing.

504
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,030
Check after you finish writing.

505
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,670
Everyone, go to the playground for ten more laps.

506
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,760
I watched the video of the test

507
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:58,760
this time.

508
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,840
Overall performance is good.

509
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,790
Individual skills and tactics

510
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,270
and team assistance ability.

511
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,960
Have made great progress.

512
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,430
You have done a good job

513
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,760
in strengthening the army with science and technology

514
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,790
and building the army with quality.

515
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:14,960
Keep up the good work.

516
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,670
Thank you for your affirmation.

517
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,480
The only regret.

518
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,190
Yan Damin.

519
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,840
Such a good soldier.

520
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,600
Unfortunately,

521
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:29,910
the transfer of Yan Damin,

522
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,310
the detachment leader,

523
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,360
I believe

524
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,390
he has thought it through carefully.

525
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:44,240
Qin Guan

526
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,840
Look inside their house.

527
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:49,310
Are there any practical difficulties?

528
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:50,960
If there is.

529
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,190
In the case of not violating the policy,

530
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,600
the party committee of our detachment.

531
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,240
Try your best to help them.

532
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,190
Yes

533
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,600
Report to captain.

534
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,080
What's the rush?

535
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:08,670
Be careful.

536
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:09,910
Report to captain.

537
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,550
Don't you know Monitor Yan is gone?

538
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,000
Why don't you try to persuade him?

539
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:17,760
I know

540
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,760
you know why you didn't stop him?

541
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:23,030
Yan Damin took the initiative

542
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,910
to apply for transfer from the Special Operations Brigade

543
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,000
to the Second Battalion on duty.

544
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,390
The team has agreed.

545
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,000
be transferred from

546
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,150
Why did the monitor transfer?

547
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,150
Captain

548
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,790
The monitor has been in the special operations brigade

549
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:34,790
for more than ten years.

550
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,030
How can you just leave?

551
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,790
Where are there so many? Why?

552
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,790
Without your monitor.

553
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,080
You can't be a soldier, can you?

554
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:59,240
I can totally understand your feelings.

555
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,000
Your squad leader is in the special operations brigade.

556
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:05,150
The one who always rushes to the front.

557
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,550
Suffering.

558
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,360
Blood flowing through.

559
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,640
Countless.

560
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,150
But by the end of this year,

561
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,760
he will have completed three issues.

562
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,670
This day will come.

563
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,720
Soldiers with iron battalions and flowing water.

564
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:32,600
You can grow up.

565
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,510
It's comfort to him

566
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,150
Captain

567
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,910
If the monitor is elected to Blue Lightning,

568
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:41,910
will he not leave?

569
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,080
He is a veteran now.

570
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,270
I believe in his choice.

571
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,270
It's all thoughtful.

572
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:54,550
As comrades-in-arms,

573
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,550
we should respect his choice.

574
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,190
Right

575
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,670
Before your monitor left.

576
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,760
I left you a message.

577
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,840
Tell me about those soldiers.

578
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,240
Work hard.

579
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,550
Continue the spirit of blue electricity for me.

580
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,600
Only heroes deserve to stay in Blue Buff.

581
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,600
Remember it all.

582
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,600
One, two, three, four,

583
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,150
one, two, three,

584
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:45,240
Cao Weimin, Cao.

585
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,310
I've known you for many years, right?

586
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,240
Kind of an old friend.

587
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:52,670
What's wrong?

588
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,190
I have a comrade-in-arms who is about to be discharged.

589
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,510
I've been in the special operations brigade for more than ten years.

590
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,760
You have good personal abilities and qualities.

591
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:01,600
Mr. Cao.

592
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,910
Don't you run a escort company?

593
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,030
Go help me find him.

594
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,240
Arrange a job for my comrade-in-arms.

595
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,720
You assigned me another task.

596
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,880
That's my brother who risked his life.

597
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,430
I hope his life is better.

598
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:21,960
Qin Guan

599
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,880
If you can put 1% of your care

600
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,240
for your comrades on me.

601
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,670
I'll be satisfied.

602
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:33,880
Did you focus on my mom

603
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,720
when she was here?

604
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:37,880
All I do is work.

605
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,390
All right, stop talking.

606
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,670
Give me a quick word.

607
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,550
Help or not.

608
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,550
Are you kidding me?

609
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:48,150
Now you're begging me.

610
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:51,360
No one is so domineering as asking for help.

611
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,600
If you have such an attitude,

612
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:57,510
I can help you or not.

613
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,310
I was wrong,

614
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,640
I was wrong, I was wrong.

615
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,030
I was wrong, Dad.

616
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,960
Let me remind you.

617
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,270
You're so bad-tempered in the army.

618
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:10,600
No way.

619
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,310
It's not up to me.

620
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,790
It's genetic.

621
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,640
You turn a blind eye to my strengths.

622
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,480
You've learned all the shortcomings.

623
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,640
And I learned more than I did.

624
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:32,790
Send me his resume.

625
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:35,480
Yes

626
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,150
Execute the order immediately.

627
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,640
Praise me.

628
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,950
Ninety-nine.

629
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,120
one hundred

630
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,710
101。 .

631
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,990
102。 .

632
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,470
103

633
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,790
104。 .

634
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:10,710
105

635
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:11,600
Okay

636
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,840
Okay

637
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,470
vice squad leader

638
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:16,920
Yes

639
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,440
Organize training

640
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:17,790
Yes

641
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,120
What do you think?

642
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,510
Are you used to being in the duty brigade?

643
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:22,640
habit

644
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:23,990
Look at my face.

645
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:24,600
They're all fat.

646
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,920
What's next?

647
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,080
I'm getting old.

648
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,680
Mental and physical strength can't keep up with the young people

649
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,120
who will be demobilized

650
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,510
at the end of the year and go home.

651
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,160
Think it through.

652
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,160
Are you really willing to leave?

653
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,400
My dad needs someone to take care of him.

654
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,840
And need to stay in Yanzhou for treatment for a long time.

655
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,270
The child's account is not registered,

656
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,310
otherwise what should I do?

657
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:50,160
I was approached by the boss of a security company.

658
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,600
He said he wanted to find one.

659
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,160
a seasoned veteran of the army.

660
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,510
Be escort captain.

661
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,510
So you mean to recommend me?

662
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:01,950
Give it back to me.

663
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,200
Which company doesn't want your condition?

664
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,030
Thank you, Captain.

665
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,680
Ms. Ding.

666
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,200
I've invited you many times.

667
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,600
I finally invited you here today.

668
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,510
Do you want to finalize the contract?

669
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,470
Yes, yes, yes.

670
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,030
It is in the honour of your company

671
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,440
to consign the goods to you.

672
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,920
There's nothing wrong with that.

673
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,270
It's so valuable.

674
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,400
Safety is absolutely the first priority.

675
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,200
Our security capabilities.

676
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,230
You know it best.

677
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,550
All in all,

678
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,790
our price / performance ratio is definitely the best.

679
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,360
Come on, have some tea.

680
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:38,880
Uncle Cao.

681
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:40,510
Qin is here.

682
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:41,790
Uncle Cao.

683
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:42,470
Hello, hello, hello.

684
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:42,750
Hello

685
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:43,230
Come on.

686
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:43,920
Let me introduce you.

687
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,790
This is Ms. Ding from Yade Auction House.

688
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,030
Qin Guan

689
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,750
Hello, Mr. Ding, commander of the Special Operations Brigade

690
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,200
of Yanzhou Detachment.

691
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:57,360
The Qin Battalion of the Special Operations Brigade

692
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,750
has been known for a long time.

693
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,360
Nice to meet you.

694
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:04,270
Uncle Cao.

695
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:05,920
That's what I told you.

696
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,640
Yan Damin

697
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,310
and Yan Monitor.

698
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:10,200
This is Mr. Cao from Zhenhang Security.

699
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:10,750
Uncle Cao.

700
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,080
Hello, Mr. Cao.

701
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,790
Salute the veterans

702
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,680
without your blood and sweat.

703
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,600
It's not as quiet as our years.

704
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,270
To serve the people.

705
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,360
Good point.

706
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:20,880
Come on.

707
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:21,880
Have a seat.

708
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,270
Sit down

709
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,470
Let's chat casually,

710
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,640
Damin.

711
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,030
Where's your resume?

712
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,030
I've already seen it.

713
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,950
The position of commander of the escort brigade

714
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,920
is yours.

715
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,880
Just let me know if you have any conditions.

716
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,030
Thank you, Uncle Cao.

717
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,310
It stands to reason that

718
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,920
you have arranged such a good job for Damin.

719
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,750
We shouldn't make any more demands.

720
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,200
But there is a difficulty.

721
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,230
Damin's daughter will go to school soon.

722
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,750
But now the problem of registered permanent residence

723
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:50,400
has not been solved.

724
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:51,470
Qin

725
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:52,600
I see.

726
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,030
Isn't it just the child's household registration problem?

727
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,440
I'll take care of it.

728
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,510
Thank you, Uncle Cao.

729
00:38:58,790 --> 00:38:59,510
Thank you, Mr. Cao.

730
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:00,880
trifle

731
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:03,920
Today, we can bring such a talented person

732
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,230
as Monitor Yan.

733
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,640
Recruit to our company.

734
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,550
That's a big happy event.

735
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,230
For this big

736
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,880
happy event.

737
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,600
We should drink some wine.

738
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,990
Let's celebrate. Let's celebrate

739
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,230
No

740
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:17,950
Ms. Ding

741
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:18,840
Ms. Ding

742
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:19,990
I'm sorry.

743
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,550
Our army has rules.

744
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,310
Don't drink.

745
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,230
Let's replace the bar

746
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:24,080
with tea.

747
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,510
Qin commander.

748
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,510
Mr. Cao is so respectable.

749
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,790
And gave such an important job

750
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:30,990
to Monitor Yan.

751
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,550
Don't embarrass him.

752
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,920
How can you say tea?

753
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,550
You have to drink.

754
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:39,990
It's okay. It's okay.

755
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:40,710
Well

756
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:41,950
Ms. Ding, here's the thing.

757
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:44,310
I know the prohibition of alcohol in the army.

758
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,310
It's very strict.

759
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:46,680
Let's dispense with the wine today.

760
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,470
Thank you for your understanding, Uncle Cao.

761
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,790
Today is the weekend.

762
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:52,080
Not working hours.

763
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:53,600
Besides, it's just the four of us.

764
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,880
It doesn't matter if you drink less.

765
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,550
Who will know if you don't tell me?

766
00:39:58,950 --> 00:39:59,600
what's more

767
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,880
Monitor Yan's life event.

768
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,200
Didn't it work out smoothly?

769
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,160
Double happiness comes in the house.

770
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,120
No drinking.

771
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,840
That doesn't make sense.

772
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:11,840
By the way, monitor Yan.

773
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,360
Actually,

774
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,200
you're the main character today.

775
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,360
Everyone has been busy for a long time.

776
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,640
It's all for you.

777
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,030
Say it yourself.

778
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:23,360
Isn't drinking tea a little boring?

779
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,600
Can it make sense?

780
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,030
Ms. Ding

781
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,990
Damin, he has a severe alcohol allergy.

782
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,550
How about this?

783
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,230
I'll call and ask for instructions.

784
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:32,600
If you allow me

785
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,710
to respect Ms. Ding for the people.

786
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,120
And Uncle Cao.

787
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:37,920
Okay, okay.

788
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,160
Ms. Ding, sit down first.

789
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,200
Okay

790
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:42,880
Captain

791
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,030
Stop calling.

792
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:45,680
I don't want this job anymore.

793
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:46,710
Let's go.

794
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:47,750
Where are you going?

795
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,470
Children don't go to school.

796
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,200
Mr. Cao's company is the only one now.

797
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:53,990
It can be solved as soon as possible.

798
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,120
Your child's registered permanent residence.

799
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:57,600
Children can't go to school.

800
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,030
Are you going back to your hometown with your family?

801
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,310
Your wife's canteen is gone?

802
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:04,440
After all these years as a soldier,

803
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:05,680
I stayed at home for a few days.

804
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,840
Do you know what your wife and children look like?

805
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:10,270
You owe it to her.

806
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,470
Now is the time for you to return the favor.

807
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,400
I can figure it out on my own.

808
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:16,600
What are you thinking?

809
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,790
I don't know who you are.

810
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,440
I have something on my mind.

811
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,400
A person who keeps his mouth shut.

812
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,310
What can you think of?

813
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:25,920
But

814
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,360
Enough

815
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:27,920
I'll take care of it for you.

816
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:35,680
Commander,

817
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:36,600
I'm Qin Guan.

818
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,600
Now that you can drink it.

819
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:43,200
Then I'll do it first.

820
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:49,310
It's your turn.

821
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:50,680
No

822
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:51,230
Well

823
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:53,600
Ms. Ding

824
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:56,680
Why do you feel sorry for me?

825
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,440
I don't want to sign the contract.

826
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,270
Well

827
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,310
Cao.

828
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:07,790
How about this.

829
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,200
Otherwise, you want the contract

830
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,400
or else.

831
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,790
Just ask your brother to give me a face.

832
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:16,600
But you.

833
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:17,550
Uncle Cao.

834
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:18,920
It's rare to be happy today.

835
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,080
Leave it alone.

836
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,030
Sit down

837
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,160
Alright

838
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:26,840
Ms. Ding

839
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:29,990
Did I finish this cup?

840
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,790
Damin can smoothly enter

841
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:32,840
Mr. Cao's company.

842
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:44,920
Yes

843
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,550
Fine, I'll drink it.

844
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,230
Captain, don't drink.

845
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:56,600
Isn't it wine?

846
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,270
What is it?

847
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:57,640
Sit down

848
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:59,080
If you want to drink, I'll drink.

849
00:42:59,200 --> 00:42:59,840
It has nothing to do with you.

850
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,200
Sit down
