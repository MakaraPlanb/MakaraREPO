1
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,890
My name is Ning Meng.

2
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,570
He is an armed police soldier.

3
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,860
June 18.

4
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,890
The vicious terrorist incident

5
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,370
in Yanzhou People's Hospital.

6
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,250
So that my armed police career

7
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,180
has become no longer ordinary.

8
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,460
Go and have a look.

9
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:05,260
Yes

10
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,290
What's going on?

11
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,370
Kill, kill, kill.

12
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,650
Call the police immediately and notify the command center.

13
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,260
Ask for backup.

14
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:17,780
Yes

15
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,290
Stop!

16
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:20,980
Ning Meng

17
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,860
Your hand, madam.

18
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:10,610
Stop!

19
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:11,650
Stop!

20
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,650
Stop!

21
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,540
Hello, sir.

22
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:13,890
The guest of honor is over there.

23
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:14,540
Stop her!

24
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,170
I'm an armed police officer.

25
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:15,980
I'm on business.

26
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,140
She's a murderer.

27
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,740
Sir, you can't enter.

28
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,420
This is the female guest.

29
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,100
Sir, this is the ladies'bathroom.

30
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,820
You can't enter.

31
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,930
Sir, seal off all entrances and exits.

32
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,300
Don't let anyone in or out.

33
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,890
No, don't kill me.

34
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,050
Don't kill me!

35
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,170
What do you think? Can you do it?

36
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:05,490
It's okay

37
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,610
Help! Help! Help!

38
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:24,700
Help! Shut up!

39
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:25,860
Shut up!

40
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,260
Help! Help me!

41
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:29,860
Stop!

42
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,210
Come again and I'll kill her.

43
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:34,890
Get out of the way!

44
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,020
Help me!

45
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,260
Stop!

46
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:42,420
Get out of the way!

47
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:43,890
Help!

48
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:44,980
Help!

49
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,260
Help!

50
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,050
Help me!

51
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:58,490
Mom

52
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:14,890
Mom

53
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:15,650
Mom

54
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:16,860
Come on, be careful.

55
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,580
Meng Meng

56
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,930
Lemon, is that you?

57
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,580
It's me

58
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,980
Are you all right, son?

59
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:21,820
I'm fine.

60
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,700
Are you okay?

61
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,700
Mom, how are you?

62
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,860
I'm fine. I'm fine.

63
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,050
You scared me to death.

64
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,490
It scared the hell out of me.

65
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,450
I thought I'd never see you again.

66
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,450
I'm scared to death. I won't.

67
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,300
No, mom.

68
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,860
Help! Help!

69
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,450
Take it easy.

70
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:43,770
Stay back!

71
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:44,860
Take it easy.

72
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,610
Come again and I'll kill her.

73
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,580
Stay back!

74
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,170
Come again and I'll kill her.

75
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:48,450
Okay

76
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,050
Freeze!

77
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:50,930
Don't hurt her.

78
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,210
Take it easy.

79
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,420
Stay back!

80
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,300
Come again and I'll kill her.

81
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:55,700
Okay, okay.

82
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,490
I won't move.

83
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:57,770
Don't hurt her.

84
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,140
What do you want to do?

85
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:04,930
Put the bottle down.

86
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,820
Help me!

87
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,940
Don't push me.

88
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,300
Okay

89
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:18,940
I'll return it

90
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,100
There are so many people here.

91
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,650
Lounge.

92
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:27,940
Take me to the lounge.

93
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,250
Then help me adjust the monitoring.

94
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,010
Okay, okay.

95
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,100
Our public security department

96
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,380
has sealed off the scene

97
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,570
and controlled the situation.

98
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,300
There is a terrorist.

99
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,650
Holding a pregnant woman hostage.

100
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:18,770
The situation is very urgent.

101
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,180
We need

102
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,690
your Armed Police Force next.

103
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,620
Cooperate with us.

104
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,010
Rescue and capture work

105
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,250
in this van held hostage by thugs.

106
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,130
It's full of medical alcohol.

107
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,570
In the event of an explosion,

108
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:32,570
the consequences would be too ghastly to contemplate.

109
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,740
At present, we are urgently organizing

110
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,540
the evacuation of the masses.

111
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,770
However, due to its large scope

112
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:39,690
and large population.

113
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,380
Expected needs.

114
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,940
About an hour or so.

115
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,570
Qin Guan

116
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:47,940
It's up

117
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:48,810
to you

118
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:49,500
Yes

119
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,770
The superior has approved it.

120
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,300
My proposal to rescue the hostages.

121
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:09,210
now

122
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,650
There was alcohol all over the floor.

123
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,690
The slightest spark could cause an explosion.

124
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:13,770
The gun was unusable.

125
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:14,500
Lin Yi

126
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:14,770
Yes

127
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:15,860
You take a sniper team?

128
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,500
Go to the roof on the east side to find the commanding heights.

129
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,330
Set up crossbows

130
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,130
and get ready for sniper attack.

131
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:20,570
Yes

132
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:21,300
Guo Xiaowei

133
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:21,770
Yes

134
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,980
You take the assault team to the roof on the west side.

135
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:24,980
Prepare for a cable drop assault.

136
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:25,500
Yes

137
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:26,860
The mob is likely

138
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,860
to be controlled by extreme thoughts.

139
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,860
She's emotionally unstable.

140
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,540
He may act excessively at any time.

141
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,770
Everybody get ready for surprise attack.

142
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:32,500
Yes

143
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,810
I'll negotiate with her.

144
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,740
Try to stall her.

145
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,010
I'll buy you some time.

146
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,570
He must be caught alive.

147
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,060
Look at my tactical gestures.

148
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:39,890
Got it

149
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:40,570
Action

150
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:40,890
Yes

151
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,380
Let's go

152
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,210
Stay back.

153
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,210
Get up

154
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:58,980
Stop!

155
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,060
Take one more step forward.

156
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,570
I'll kill her.

157
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:04,330
Take it easy.

158
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:05,330
Look

159
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,130
I'm unarmed

160
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:07,540
Look

161
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,650
You're safe now.

162
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:12,570
I'm here to help you.

163
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:13,860
Let's talk.

164
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,330
Commando team in position now.

165
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,130
Take it easy.

166
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,890
Sniper team in position now.

167
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,890
Commando Group is in position.

168
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:37,980
Sniper team is in position.

169
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,940
You, a knife.

170
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:41,690
Stay away from her.

171
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,810
A little further away.

172
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,010
You hurt her.

173
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:44,980
Don't hurt her.

174
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,180
It's easy for us to talk.

175
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,330
You've been away from home for a long time, haven't you?

176
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,100
Look at your age.

177
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,540
The child is only three or five years old.

178
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,450
Boy, girl,

179
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,500
what do you want?

180
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,100
Don't get me wrong.

181
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,210
We're just talking.

182
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,860
I don't have children,

183
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,450
but I know a mother.

184
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,420
It's so hard to be pregnant in October.

185
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,770
It is said that being a mother is just.

186
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,010
But I believe that a mother.

187
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,420
There will be a soft place inside.

188
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,650
It's for your family and children.

189
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,100
You've left such a place.

190
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,650
You too, right?

191
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:29,250
Stop!

192
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:31,890
I won't move.

193
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:37,380
Let her go.

194
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,940
The baby in her belly.

195
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,810
But she's innocent.

196
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,330
Let her go.

197
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:42,540
Your question.

198
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,100
Let me find a way to help you out.

199
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:50,060
I killed so many people.

200
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,010
There's no turning back.

201
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,130
How can there be no turning back?

202
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:58,890
Put the knife down now.

203
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,890
Give me the lighter.

204
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,180
Then you can go back.

205
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,130
It's too late.

206
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,570
Think about your family.

207
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:09,890
Think about your child.

208
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:11,130
Think again.

209
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,810
You look happy when you hold the baby.

210
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,810
How beautiful it is.

211
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:18,650
It's too late.

212
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:20,770
It's too late.

213
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,980
I'm sorry.

214
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,860
See you next life.

215
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,300
Fighting back is not what smart people should do.

216
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,650
Who are you?

217
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,100
It doesn't matter who I am.

218
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,570
Only I can help you.

219
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,180
I hope we can cooperate happily.

220
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,380
Have you dealt with her behavior?

221
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,010
All the surveillance cameras in the neighborhood have been taken care of.

222
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:57,250
Good

223
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,940
After the incident at the People's Hospital,

224
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
local Party committees, governments,

225
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,300
public security and armed police forces, etc.

226
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,450
Hold an emergency meeting to organize the deployment.

227
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:07,380
soon afterwards

228
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,010
Our special operations detachment

229
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,810
received an order from the superior to cooperate with the public security department

230
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,130
in handling the case.

231
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,060
This incident.

232
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,690
Let the detachment leader realize

233
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,620
the importance of absorbing female special operations team members.

234
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,450
And necessity.

235
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,010
Comrades,

236
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,620
we have three more months.

237
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,740
Yanzhou International Convention and Exhibition Center.

238
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,770
Will be put into use.

239
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,130
The Global Energy Conference

240
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,180
will also be held here.

241
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,690
The superior informed that

242
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,130
the terrorist attack this time

243
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,940
was organized by the treasure hunt.

244
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,740
By being employed.

245
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,450
The goal is.

246
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,860
in order to create an atmosphere of tension

247
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,380
and terror.

248
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,180
And then disrupt

249
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,420
the smooth convening of the global energy conference

250
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,060
also

251
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,330
It belongs to the terrorist group S.

252
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,380
Leader number two

253
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,100
grey wolf

254
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,010
He has sneaked into our city

255
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,450
for obvious purposes.

256
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:54,860
They are all.

257
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,980
It's for the global energy conference,

258
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,940
so our superiors instructed us

259
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,540
to work out

260
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,420
the strictest security plan.

261
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,650
And this scheme

262
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,540
should adopt the highest specifications.

263
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:08,740
code name

264
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,300
That's why Qin Guan proposed

265
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,180
Operation Lightning.

266
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,540
In order to successfully complete Operation Lightning,

267
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,380
we must temporarily form a new type of special operations

268
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,330
commando mixed with men and women.

269
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,010
The specific reason will be reported by Qin Guan.

270
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:26,570
Yes

271
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,450
New changes have taken place

272
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,420
in the current international anti-terrorism situation.

273
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,330
The subject of terrorists is more complex.

274
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,100
There are

275
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,620
more and more female terrorists

276
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:38,890
in this hospital tragedy.

277
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,380
This was confirmed once again.

278
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,450
The only terrorist who escaped this time.

279
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,530
It's about being a woman.

280
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,210
If a female special warfare team member

281
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,860
escapes from the female bathroom,

282
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,690
he will enter the female bathroom as soon as possible.

283
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,290
We won't let this female terrorist

284
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,330
use her gender advantage to escape

285
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:57,530
In this regard

286
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,900
We should speed up.

287
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,140
Recruit outstanding female soldiers.

288
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,140
Enter the special operations team.

289
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,780
They are small in size, quick in thinking,

290
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,980
delicate in emotion and concealed.

291
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,290
Yeah, female terrorists.

292
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,500
More advantageous and other characteristics

293
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,140
of the temporary formation.

294
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,050
A special warfare team composed of men and women.

295
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,330
It would be more effective in ensuring

296
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,530
the successful completion of Operation Lightning.

297
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:17,570
Therefore, I suggest that

298
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,860
eight seconded female soldiers

299
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,530
should be openly selected within the whole corps.

300
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,450
There are six male soldiers.

301
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:24,450
A total of 14 people.

302
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,380
Code name blue lightning commando.

303
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,690
Execute Operation Lightning.

304
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:29,810
Well

305
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,690
Female special operations team members

306
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,330
have no precedent in our detachment.

307
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,260
In management, in life, in training.

308
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,980
Will there be a problem?

309
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:38,930
Yes

310
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,380
There must be some difficulties.

311
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,450
However, we will arrange for female soldiers and male soldiers

312
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,810
to live and manage separately

313
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,170
in strict accordance with the management system

314
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,290
and living order of the army,

315
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,210
and do not interfere with each other in their lives.

316
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,330
In this regard

317
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,210
I suggest whether Comrade Wen Jing

318
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,050
can be the instructor of the Blue Lightning Commando.

319
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,980
Be responsible for the management of female soldiers.

320
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:56,900
quiet and refined

321
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:57,980
Yes

322
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,290
What do you think?

323
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,330
Obey the organization's arrangement.

324
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:02,530
Okay

325
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,330
commissar

326
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,380
This matter must be implemented as soon as possible.

327
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,020
Okay

328
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,570
We'll report the application to the superior immediately.

329
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,450
Set up the Blue Lightning Commando.

330
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,380
Thank you, Commander and commissar.

331
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,380
Qin Guan

332
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,410
Set up the Blue Lightning Commando on an ad hoc basis.

333
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,020
There is no precedent to follow.

334
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:29,020
Time is tight, the task is heavy, and the responsibility is great.

335
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:30,690
Do you have confidence?

336
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,050
Don't worry, detachment leader.

337
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:33,780
Blue electricity can't be built well.

338
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,330
Qin Guan will take off his uniform.

339
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,170
After many levels of selection,

340
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,780
this was the final decision.

341
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,690
A list of 50 people.

342
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:44,020
Look at

343
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,930
the conditions.

344
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,290
That's not good.

345
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,140
Her skills are not good.

346
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,530
Although her skills are not top-notch,

347
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,980
modern anti-terrorism operations

348
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,500
look at comprehensive capabilities.

349
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,570
She has the potential.

350
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,570
I chose it carefully.

351
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,380
And look.

352
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,930
I know all about it.

353
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,410
Don't look at how well her resume is written.

354
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,620
That's all a showboat.

355
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,290
How do you know

356
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,290
when you haven't tried to put on airs?

357
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,260
She's just putting on airs.

358
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,620
Besides,

359
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,020
during the June 18 incident.

360
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,210
Didn't she stand out very well?

361
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,900
I'm here on June 18th.

362
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,100
It's different.

363
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,380
I think this lemon is better.

364
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,930
He's just a talent.

365
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,690
Train her well in the future.

366
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,530
Now, the superior leader.

367
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,210
Isn't it always emphasized over and over again?

368
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:56,810
Quality,

369
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,210
science and technology make the army strong,

370
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,690
this talent is the most critical.

371
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:08,780
From now on,

372
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,980
you put down all the work at hand.

373
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,450
Set up this blue electricity for me.

374
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:14,330
Good training.

375
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:14,860
Yes

376
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,100
Ensure the completion of the task.

377
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,050
at ease

378
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:19,290
Tell me about it.

379
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,140
Hello,

380
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,050
my name is Qin Guan.

381
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,330
It's commander from here.

382
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,450
From now on, he will be the captain of the Blue Lightning Commando.

383
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,660
So handsome

384
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,620
Captain is so handsome.

385
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,810
This is Wen Jing, the instructor.

386
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:42,860
Hello,

387
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,570
everyone. Here are your resumes.

388
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,290
It says

389
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,260
you're the best of all units.

390
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,570
There are plenty of soldiers from our special operations team.

391
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,410
There are a lot of single subjects.

392
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,660
The holder of the highest record.

393
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,900
Some are top schools.

394
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,860
Graduated high flyers.

395
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,330
Some are in actual combat.

396
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,810
The king of soldiers,

397
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,260
but your past.

398
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,290
At Blue Lightning it's worthless.

399
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,740
Blue Lightning Commando

400
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,810
was built for the mission.

401
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,330
Built for heroes.

402
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,980
Only heroes deserve to stay.

403
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,290
Only heroes deserve to go to war. Soldiers

404
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,020
who don't want to be heroes.

405
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,210
You can quit now.

406
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:01,930
Good

407
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,620
Looks like you all want to be heroes.

408
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,570
You'd better remember who I am today.

409
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,050
Because this is going to be

410
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,210
the kindest I've ever done to you.

411
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,290
See this wall?

412
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,530
The names of each of you.

413
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,500
It's all written on it.

414
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,050
From this moment on,

415
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,410
you are nothing.

416
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:26,290
You're just an egg.

417
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,260
Zero eggs.

418
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,050
You will receive the most brutal training.

419
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,450
People who have been eliminated.

420
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,660
Tear off your name from this wall.

421
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,100
And then leave with their tails between their legs.

422
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,020
Only those left behind.

423
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,450
To deserve a name.

424
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,860
Stay under the Blue Lightning Commando logo.

425
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,140
Understand?

426
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:50,210
Got it

427
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,140
This selection is divided into three rounds,

428
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,780
and each round will be eliminated.

429
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,330
In the end, only 14 people remained.

430
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,260
If you want to stay in Blue Lightning,

431
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,330
show me your skills.

432
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,500
Yes

433
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:03,620
Didn't you wake up?

434
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:04,930
Do you understand?

435
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,410
Got it

436
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,210
Got it

437
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,050
Got it

438
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,330
Flying saucer target 100 meters ahead.

439
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,260
Only if you hit them all can you be considered qualified.

440
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,410
There will be interference items in the account item.

441
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:21,980
Yang Shu

442
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,930
Members of the national shooting team

443
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,900
won the

444
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,690
World Military Sniper Competition.

445
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:29,140
You're overbearing.

446
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,140
Be competitive

447
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,050
and always be the first.

448
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:32,930
Don't be second.

449
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,260
Very accurate.

450
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,780
Xu Dongdong

451
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,020
is very explosive.

452
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,210
Asian mixed martial arts

453
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,810
China women's lightweight champion

454
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,660
Tong Mengyao

455
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:33,740
Armed Police Force

456
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:34,810
peak special warfare competition

457
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,380
newly compiled individual champion.

458
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,290
This is a mock hostage rescue operation.

459
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,930
You only have two minutes to clear out all kinds of distractions.

460
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:44,980
At the same time, remove the electronic anklet.

461
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:45,980
And electronic bombs.

462
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:46,780
Start

463
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,170
There are two times

464
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:26,050
Not bad

465
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,260
How about

466
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:31,620
programmers?

467
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,290
Guo Xiaowei

468
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:39,330
is an expert in reconnaissance. He

469
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,330
has a flexible mind

470
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,170
and is good at climbing and jumping.

471
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,810
This house is a place for terrorists.

472
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,140
Where you used to live.

473
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,690
There are dozens of lines of simple information,

474
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:48,900
ten important information.

475
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,410
Five Crucial Messages.

476
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,170
You have to get rid of interfering messages

477
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,380
and paint a terrorist portrait

478
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,810
within a minute.

479
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:55,780
Start

480
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:07,260
Report

481
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:09,620
After a comprehensive analysis of the information,

482
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:10,810
we can analyze and collate the terrorists.

483
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:11,810
Make the following portrait.

484
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:12,690
male

485
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:13,930
About thirty-five years old.

486
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,100
Strong,

487
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,140
everyday disguised as a bricklayer.

488
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:18,530
to be good at making explosives.

489
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,380
Smoking

490
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,100
be addicted to alcohol

491
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,210
Good at using daggers.

492
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,330
What do you think?

493
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:26,410
My soldiers.

494
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,100
Now it shows that Li Sisi

495
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:35,210
is proficient in many languages and lips.

496
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,980
He's a private who's been in the army for a year.

497
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,450
How many terrorists are there in this room?

498
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,050
You need to record everything they say

499
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,980
by reading your lips.

500
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:46,900
Start

501
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:48,530
English

502
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:52,020
Said they had four accomplices in the house.

503
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,260
Holding two pistols respectively.

504
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,570
And two AK47s

505
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,140
in Arabic now.

506
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,210
It's French now.

507
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,530
Translation is finished.

508
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,170
From the way they talk and their attitudes,

509
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,450
we can roughly tell that

510
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,660
Terrorist One is their leader.

511
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:18,620
They're giving orders to the other three.

512
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:19,740
Report finished.

513
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,140
What do you think?

514
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,660
All the translation contents of lip reading are correct.

515
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:32,660
Du Xinyu

516
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,620
was nicknamed Cheshen

517
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,500
in the first driving skill of the former army.

518
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,900
Battlefield simulation is ahead.

519
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,620
You need to remove all obstacles

520
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:41,930
in a minute and a half.

521
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:42,810
A chariot of fire

522
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,050
crossing the fire line!

523
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:56,500
Captain

524
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:59,330
Whose turn is it for the next personal presentation?

525
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,100
I can tell.

526
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,780
The captain already knows

527
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,170
the strength of male soldiers.

528
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,500
Therefore, we are extremely cautious and strict

529
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,140
in selecting female special operations team members.

530
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,620
I, Ning Meng, am strong enough to meet the standard.

531
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,570
It's my turn to show it.

532
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:34,860
You

533
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,140
You can go now.

534
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:39,020
Report

535
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,050
I haven't tested it yet.

536
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:45,210
What test?

537
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:47,690
You don't meet the standards of Blue Power.

538
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:54,050
Report to captain.

539
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,210
Do you remember?

540
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,810
I'm in the hospital.

541
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,330
I caught thugs with you.

542
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,410
It's you!

543
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,500
Your sustained combat effectiveness is too weak.

544
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:09,100
If I hadn't saved you that day,

545
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,140
you wouldn't have had a chance to stand here.

546
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:13,930
I subdued three thugs with my bare hands.

547
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:15,780
And I don't think

548
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,740
I'm any worse

549
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,570
than anyone here today.

550
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:21,020
Not bad

551
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:25,330
What we want is elite soldiers and strong generals.

552
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,690
Tell me.

553
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:28,690
What are you better than them?

554
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,620
There's a place.

555
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:38,260
I must be better

556
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,100
than them.

557
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:49,660
head

558
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,330
Oh my god!

559
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,100
Are you the only one with brains?

560
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,530
Arrogant and mindless.

561
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,930
Can you speak?

562
00:33:59,210 --> 00:33:59,860
I'm telling you,

563
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,740
it really needs to be compared.

564
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,930
It doesn't have to be

565
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,810
anyone's fault. Shut up!

566
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,290
See?

567
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:10,620
You've caused a lot of anger.

568
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:11,740
Let's go.

569
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,290
But I haven't been tested yet.

570
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:15,380
What's wrong?

571
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,380
Report

572
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,330
I haven't been tested yet.

573
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,170
I need to prove that I'm capable.

574
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:26,380
Did I ask you to speak?

575
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,100
Qin Guan

576
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:27,860
Yes

577
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:34,570
As I said,

578
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,290
every soldier

579
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,410
has a chance to show himself.

580
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:41,780
Yes

581
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:51,900
What do you want to show?

582
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:55,530
Quick identification test

583
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,690
of this group of people.

584
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,530
There's only one real terrorist.

585
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,170
You need to find him in a minute.

586
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,530
Otherwise, you will be shot and killed by the other party.

587
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,290
Time begins.

588
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,570
According to behavioral psychology,

589
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,570
as long as it's human.

590
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,140
There will be subconsciously small movements.

591
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:24,980
And the truth to be determined

592
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,050
is often passed.

593
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,780
His body language was revealed.

594
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:58,660
Did you hit it?

595
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,180
You can all leave.

596
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:13,490
reason

597
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,860
On the surface, there is nothing unusual.

598
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,860
But his micro-expression revealed him.

599
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:18,940
Look carefully at the micro-expression

600
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,770
and play it back.

601
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:22,420
class monitor

602
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,730
Please play it back for me.

603
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:24,420
Okay

604
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:32,380
Stop

605
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:34,180
class monitor

606
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,810
Please help me push the expression on number nine.

607
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:41,330
Look

608
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,460
When I look at other people.

609
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:45,660
The corners of Nine's mouth rose slightly.

610
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:46,810
A little confident.

611
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,010
It shows

612
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,900
his belief in his identity as a terrorist.

613
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,490
He was delighted not to be seen through,

614
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,810
and his brows furrowed slightly.

615
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:57,050
Showing strong aggressiveness.

616
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:57,770
Ning Meng

617
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:58,810
You did well.

618
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,810
Congratulations on passing the test.

619
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,100
Do you still look like a soldier?

620
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,810
You can all leave.

621
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:12,220
Yes

622
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:24,620
Awesome!

623
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,010
What do you think?

624
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,420
Is the soldier I recommended good?

625
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:37,050
Train me well.

626
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,770
What's going on?

627
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:18,530
It's weird when you come back.

628
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,100
Don't you think you have a good mind?

629
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,620
I forgot when I turned around.

630
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:29,620
I'm sorry.

631
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,420
I wanted to get into Blue Power so badly.

632
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,140
That's why he said such a thing.

633
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,420
Your acting is so good.

634
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,180
I'll slap you.

635
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,220
I'm sorry to tell you again.

636
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,010
Can you forgive me?

637
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:44,010
Forget it.

638
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,330
We are all in the same dormitory.

639
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:55,900
Fine

640
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,620
If slapping me

641
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,970
can relieve your anger,

642
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,460
then you can.

643
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,140
Okay

644
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:03,900
Boring

645
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,940
Who are you calling boring?

646
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,250
I said you were boring.

647
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,620
They all say they want to stay

648
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,140
in Blue Lightning. They're petty.

649
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,460
None of them looked like soldiers.

650
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:12,900
Yang Shu

651
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:13,530
Tong Mengyao,

652
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,420
settle the matter here first.

653
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,220
Ning Meng

654
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:21,420
Let me tell you.

655
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,050
I'm here, Xu Dongdong.

656
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,770
You're not getting into the Blue Buff.

657
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,010
All units, vehicles, attention please.

658
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:37,970
Coordinates 3214, 52, 876, 24, full speed forward.

659
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,490
Report to command center, copy that.

660
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:41,620
Within a minute.

661
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,970
Cross the slope ahead to the finish line.

662
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,010
One who gives up halfway or times out

663
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:46,620
die out

664
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,050
Time begins.

665
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:31,970
Time's up.

666
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,700
The last eight are eliminated.

667
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:46,810
After a brutal selection,

668
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:49,700
batches of soldiers were eliminated one after another.

669
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:53,530
Left Blue Power with remorse and regret.

670
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,100
I'll say it again.

671
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:29,380
No matter who you used to be.

672
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,420
What did you do?

673
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,380
Everyone is equal

674
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,730
before the selection criteria.

675
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,490
Don't think it's cruel.

676
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,460
The terrorists you will face in the future

677
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,900
will be a hundred times more cruel than this.

678
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:43,330
If you want to stay here,

679
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:46,180
just work hard.

680
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:47,660
Otherwise, you will be

681
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:49,530
the next one to leave

682
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,730
Yes

683
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:51,700
Yes

684
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,700
Yes
