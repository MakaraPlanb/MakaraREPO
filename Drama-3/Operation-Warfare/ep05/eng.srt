1
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,810
Li Sisi

2
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,040
Come on

3
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:46,810
Shout one

4
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,570
Okay

5
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,770
Li Sisi

6
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,240
Come on

7
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,400
Come on

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,970
Come on

9
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,320
You're the best.

10
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,000
Let's go! Let's go!

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,400
Okay

12
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,490
The commander of the female soldier team is also here.

13
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,480
Qin, Qin.

14
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,440
Lend me some shampoo.

15
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:54,760
It smells like lavender.

16
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,650
You look like a female soldier with shampoo.

17
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,560
It's all different.

18
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,730
I'll teach my brother

19
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,160
some experience when.

20
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:03,650
Whether or not?

21
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,520
Come on

22
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,560
Bring a female soldier. Okay.

23
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,120
Bring female soldiers

24
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,120
Qin

25
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,370
Your shampoo is really good.

26
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,760
This foam is so strong.

27
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,320
What are you doing?

28
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:53,760
What are you doing?

29
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:54,650
What?

30
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,200
What's wrong?

31
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:56,730
What's wrong?

32
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:57,170
What are you doing?

33
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,120
So fierce.

34
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,090
What's wrong?

35
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,090
He bullied our captain.

36
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:00,960
What are you doing?

37
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:01,890
What are you doing?

38
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:02,370
Guo Xiaowei

39
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:03,320
Yes

40
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,370
What are you doing?

41
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:06,840
Take a shower

42
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,010
Yes

43
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:09,560
Yes

44
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,040
Yes

45
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,400
What's wrong? What's wrong?

46
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,450
What are you yelling about?

47
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,040
Report

48
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,170
This man is always squeezing shampoo on your head.

49
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,010
He's messing with you.

50
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,370
Qin

51
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,730
You're bad, Qin.

52
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,840
Qin commander doesn't know him.

53
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,930
Don't say put shampoo on my head.

54
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,680
Even if you pour boiling water, it's fine.

55
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,120
Apologize

56
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,530
I'm sorry

57
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:34,960
Zhao brigade soldiers.

58
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,480
As expected, he has the strength of a newborn calf.

59
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:37,730
Not bad

60
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,760
Go take a shower.

61
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:39,680
Yes

62
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:41,890
Why don't you two

63
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,450
wash here?

64
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:51,960
Qin.

65
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,200
You've been practicing well lately.

66
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,730
Please do it when you have time.

67
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,560
You'd better spend more time on training.

68
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,290
How dare you say

69
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,600
you are training.

70
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,810
Have you noticed that

71
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,560
a female soldier has been watching you recently?

72
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,170
It seems to be the one called.

73
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,250
The one called Land Tank.

74
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,930
Little tank, keep looking at me.

75
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,680
No way.

76
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,010
If you don't say so,

77
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,090
I think you are quite concerned about Ning Meng.

78
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,650
You don't understand.

79
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,320
Focus on good soldiers.

80
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,650
Do a good job of passing on and helping others.

81
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,810
It's our outstanding veterans.

82
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,400
The best quality.

83
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,730
Here we go again. Here we go again.

84
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,370
You always look like this.

85
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,730
Can you talk nice?

86
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,170
Sure.

87
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:43,450
It hurts

88
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,040
Do you want to rub me to death?

89
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,680
Are you afraid you can't beat me in the test tomorrow?

90
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,120
Can't compare with you.

91
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,200
Grow some meat.

92
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,160
After I finished rubbing it for you, I lost two pounds.

93
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:55,370
Look at the mud.

94
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,090
See?

95
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,130
Rub it well.

96
00:05:58,690 --> 00:05:59,090
Where are you rubbing?

97
00:05:59,090 --> 00:05:59,720
See?

98
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:20,650
It's not Team Zhao.

99
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,320
How did you get this knife wound?

100
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,160
How could I forget this?

101
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,690
The robbery that shocked the whole country last year.

102
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,570
Our captain.

103
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,320
One man knocked out three gunmen with knives.

104
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,970
That scar was left

105
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,570
to save an old man.

106
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,000
Why is it so handsome?

107
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,530
Handsome, right?

108
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:39,810
Cool

109
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:40,410
Captain

110
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,880
This gunshot wound to your chest is penetrating.

111
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,530
I remember it was before.

112
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,970
He left it in the barren hills

113
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:48,600
in the east.

114
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,280
Right

115
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,250
I remember at that time.

116
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,130
The captain is very fierce alone.

117
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,600
One man and one gun.

118
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,320
Killed seven terrorists.

119
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:55,720
No

120
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:56,370
Eight

121
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:56,760
Yes

122
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,440
That's eight.

123
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,280
Eight.

124
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,530
That mission was famous for shaking the whole team.

125
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,320
The commissar of the corps personally awarded the captain

126
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,810
the second-class medal of merit.

127
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:04,930
Second class merit, you know?

128
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:05,810
Have you seen it?

129
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,530
Captain Zhao, how did you get this gunshot wound?

130
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,000
How could you forget that?

131
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,160
the year before last

132
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,930
Armed robbery

133
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,040
at the mall downtown.

134
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,570
Armed robbery.

135
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,570
I remember now.

136
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,440
The terrorist.

137
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,440
Robbed the jewelry store.

138
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:20,970
What happened?

139
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,090
Team Zhao is alone. Guess what?

140
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:23,600
What's wrong?

141
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,410
What's wrong?

142
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,250
Zhao's team three times five

143
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:26,970
divided by two kaka kaka.

144
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,650
They cleaned it all up.

145
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,040
You can't even describe it as handsome.

146
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,130
What can you

147
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,040
call it?

148
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:34,720
What?

149
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,200
What?

150
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,280
Qu Bo, tell me.

151
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,410
God of War.

152
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,810
God of War

153
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:40,200
war-god

154
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,280
Can you match it?

155
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,970
Can't compare,

156
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,930
brother, just take a rest.

157
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,130
Watch carefully.

158
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:46,850
Captain

159
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,370
Show them the knife wounds the other day.

160
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,160
I know that.

161
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:52,130
I scratched two people

162
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,280
with contraband the other day

163
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,160
with broken glass.

164
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,370
Mighty

165
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,130
powerful

166
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,480
Mighty, mighty.

167
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,040
Where are we?

168
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,250
There's really no way to compete with Zhao.

169
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,130
His body was covered in wounds.

170
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,370
We don't have a good place.

171
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,650
That's right

172
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,000
What does a scar mean to a soldier?

173
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,930
Military medal.

174
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,160
Yes

175
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,530
Pull down

176
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,410
the military medal.

177
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,480
More injuries indicate that you are not good at home.

178
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,650
I've been on 11 sudden missions.

179
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,600
It's only nine times.

180
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,720
But there are more injuries than me.

181
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,720
What does this mean?

182
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,130
What does it mean?

183
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,600
Can't you do it well?

184
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,200
skill

185
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,810
Beaten, beaten, come out and show off.

186
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,250
Everyone has it

187
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:41,720
Right

188
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:42,370
serious

189
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:42,970
Qu Bo

190
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,200
It's a military badge. Okay.

191
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,650
Second-class merit is better.

192
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,250
I don't understand.

193
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,090
I don't understand.

194
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:55,880
Team Zhao

195
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,850
Is there anything else I can do for you?

196
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,690
Get out of here.

197
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:06,850
Boss

198
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:07,930
What do you think?

199
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,690
Did you find out?

200
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,200
The boss is prophetic.

201
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,160
There is indeed an omission.

202
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,440
James also has a close confidant.

203
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,570
He went abroad after James's accident.

204
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,090
So he should have it.

205
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,320
Who is it?

206
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:21,880
Shen Bo

207
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:35,760
Tell me

208
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,600
Is this psychology really useful?

209
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,250
Of course it works.

210
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,440
Psychology can help us test lies.

211
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,250
Tell me about it.

212
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,930
Like what?

213
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,530
When you're lying.

214
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,250
Your eyes will move.

215
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,410
Get used to looking at the top right.

216
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:58,200
upper right

217
00:09:58,850 --> 00:09:59,130
How about this

218
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:00,600
That's a lie.

219
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:02,810
Go on.

220
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:04,880
What about the second one?

221
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,320
That is, the range of movements of the whole body will become larger.

222
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:09,210
Restlessness,

223
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,570
sweating all over.

224
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:14,770
What else?

225
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,930
Also, the lower limbs.

226
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,280
Bend your left knee forward slightly

227
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,080
and apply force to your right sole.

228
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,770
Get ready to run away in advance.

229
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,010
Such a university student?

230
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,400
Of course.

231
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,010
If every soldier in our special operations

232
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:35,840
brigade.

233
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,160
Everyone has the ability of my girlfriend.

234
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,040
Then we must win every battle,

235
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,040
right?

236
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,450
Of course.

237
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:48,400
political instructor

238
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:53,130
Ning Meng

239
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,400
You miss my brother?

240
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,400
Why are you here?

241
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,210
I'll meet you in the office.

242
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,210
But you're not here.

243
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,010
I guessed that you might be here.

244
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,040
So I came here.

245
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,080
Is there anything I can do for you?

246
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,450
I think psychology

247
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,770
is very useful in carrying out anti-terrorism missions.

248
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,210
to be able to play a special role.

249
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,040
So I want to ask you

250
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,480
for some professional knowledge.

251
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:20,450
Sure

252
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,640
I'll teach you now.

253
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,480
I hope you can use it

254
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,280
in the future.

255
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,570
Thank you, instructor.

256
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,280
Ning Meng

257
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,930
You look like your brother.

258
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:32,450
Let's go

259
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:39,840
It was getting closer and closer

260
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,640
to the day of Operation Lightning.

261
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,770
The team members of Blue Lightning should be determined as soon as possible.

262
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,840
Today is the knockout round.

263
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,130
The content is to rescue

264
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,080
the hostages. There are 21 of you.

265
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,480
There are 14 hostages.

266
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,720
So there were seven of them.

267
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,250
You must be eliminated today.

268
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,010
A hostage.

269
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,370
is guarded by three terrorists.

270
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,040
Those who successfully unlock the hostage's electronic bracelet

271
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,480
within the specified time

272
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,370
will be promoted.

273
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,520
How can one save

274
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:05,770
three terrorists?

275
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,520
It's too hard.

276
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,160
an almost impossible task.

277
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,330
Distribute different weapons and equipment

278
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,080
according to your special skills.

279
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,210
Get your gear now.

280
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,130
All of them.

281
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:18,770
Attention!

282
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:20,520
Get your equipment.

283
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,810
The knockout round is now officially on.

284
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,600
All of them.

285
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:48,280
Attention!

286
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,210
Turn right.

287
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,370
Run, go

288
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:50,810
Captain

289
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,330
Why did you arrange it like this?

290
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:56,080
One man against three terrorists.

291
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:57,770
And this terrorist

292
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,720
is a veteran carefully selected by you?

293
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,960
This task is almost impossible.

294
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,010
Every one of them.

295
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,570
Have their own different characteristics.

296
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,810
But they all have the same characteristics.

297
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,130
It's heroic

298
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,280
to take this opportunity.

299
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,810
Let them understand a truth.

300
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,130
Walk alone fast,

301
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:17,600
and walk far away

302
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:34,720
Lin Yi

303
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,810
Which district are you going to look for terrorists?

304
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,400
Two people have already been eliminated.

305
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,080
The opponent's firepower is very strong.

306
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,640
Do you have any good ideas?

307
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,640
Does it have anything to do with you?

308
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:47,840
Snipers.

309
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,600
Do you always talk like that?

310
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,720
It's so cool.

311
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,600
What do you want?

312
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,480
She wants to cooperate with an expert like you.

313
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,720
Why are you everywhere?

314
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,690
Let's form a group.

315
00:15:58,690 --> 00:15:59,210
Three against three.

316
00:15:59,210 --> 00:15:59,840
We have a chance of winning.

317
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,130
Not bad,

318
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,080
captain. They're all arranged by vicious people.

319
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,690
Let's fight alone.

320
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:05,930
It's a little hard.

321
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,130
The three of us have a better chance of winning.

322
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,520
Do you think that's the truth?

323
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,160
The three of them were in pairs.

324
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,280
The distance is fifteen meters.

325
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,210
I'll throw a flare in.

326
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,040
You'll have a blinding time of 10 seconds.

327
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,690
They heard my voice.

328
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,810
Will shoot at the door.

329
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,600
I have to move clockwise to shoot.

330
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,520
Kill three people in three seconds.

331
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,330
Why did you take my hostage?

332
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:16,720
This hostage is mine.

333
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,520
And the other hostages are mine.

334
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,330
But you've already advanced.

335
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,280
Practice

336
00:17:58,890 --> 00:17:59,250
class monitor

337
00:17:59,250 --> 00:17:59,930
Look for it here, too.

338
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,810
I studied the layout of the building here.

339
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,080
There must be kidnappers and hostages here.

340
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,040
We want to go together.

341
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,370
Work harder.

342
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:16,480
You have to.

343
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,890
Don't fool around all day.

344
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,250
We're the only ones who can save the hostages.

345
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,720
It's easier and more enjoyable.

346
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,520
I'll tell you again.

347
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,600
Take it seriously

348
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,840
or you'll regret it.

349
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,160
Yes, monitor.

350
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,280
Be careful, too.

351
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,450
Smelly boy still cares about me?

352
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:33,720
Mind your own business.

353
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:37,770
That's right

354
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,040
With the strength of our monitor

355
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:40,970
Win without doubt

356
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,490
You're too focused.

357
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,690
I'm looking at how he looks at the direction.

358
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,210
And terrain to search for enemies.

359
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,210
Keep your voice down.

360
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,000
Okay, okay.

361
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,570
It doesn't affect your study.

362
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,210
Stop staring around all the time.

363
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:24,970
Keep an eye on the drone in the command center.

364
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:25,810
But I can't advance.

365
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,930
What's my nickname?

366
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,640
Demon child,

367
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:31,610
you can't scream for nothing.

368
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:50,450
Captain

369
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,120
There are six of us.

370
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,400
Unmanned aerial vehicle monitoring screen.

371
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,490
Why do you keep looking at Lin Yi?

372
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,730
Captain is looking forward to it.

373
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,570
Lin Yi has done a great job this time.

374
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,810
Do it yourself. You'll have plenty to eat and wear.

375
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,690
Why is there no picture on number one?

376
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:47,930
Report

377
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:48,880
The drone has failed.

378
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,610
We're trying to figure out why.

379
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:50,850
Take care of it right away.

380
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,280
Yes

381
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:54,760
Get drone two in here.

382
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:55,930
Yes

383
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,160
You're mine now.

384
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,450
Go ahead

385
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,970
Why did Ning Meng stay still?

386
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,360
She's working on tactics.

387
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,090
There are few hostages in Zone One.

388
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,330
There are many hostages in Zone 2.

389
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,570
Which district do you think she's going to?

390
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,520
Although there are many hostages in Zone 2,

391
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:12,850
there are more competitors.

392
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,040
Why don't you go to zone one?

393
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:28,930
Attention, attention.

394
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,400
Look at ten o'clock.

395
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,970
A hostage was found on the second floor.

396
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,360
There are three terrorists in the vicinity.

397
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:34,400
There was another group of people.

398
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,280
Approaching the target.

399
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,810
So many people are fighting for the same target.

400
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,570
The scene was extremely chaotic.

401
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,610
We can't get in.

402
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,570
How did the Demon Child know?

403
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:01,570
I don't know anything.

404
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I also know what the captain is doing now.

405
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,000
Would you like to hear it?

406
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,040
Aren't you afraid the captain will hear you say that?

407
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,160
Don't worry.

408
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,450
This is a local area network.

409
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,090
I encrypted the channels of the three of us.

410
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:11,970
Tong Mengyao,

411
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:13,730
are you.

412
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:14,970
Blackened the drone

413
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:15,640
in the command center.

414
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,640
He is really worthy of being appreciated by Tank.

415
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,850
Your brain is easy to use.

416
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,210
This battle is really lively.

417
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,520
The technique is so bad.

418
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,400
Forget it

419
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:48,760
Let's change the target.

420
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,490
Wait

421
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,210
The people inside are making random calls.

422
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,210
No one took advantage of it.

423
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,880
Two terrorists were killed,

424
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,040
but one terrorist.

425
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:55,930
Took the hostages and ran away.

426
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:57,490
They hitched a ride in a jeep.

427
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,240
Let's go

428
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:09,930
Tong Mengyao,

429
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:10,850
report me your position.

430
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,400
The jeep moved in a northeast direction.

431
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,040
Turn right 50 meters ahead.

432
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,880
Drone 2 caught Lin Yi.

433
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:48,120
Continuously report the target trajectory,

434
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,090
and the target enters the construction road.

435
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:00,880
Target vehicle:

436
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,360
156 meters ahead of turn, turn left.

437
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,400
Will be out of sight.

438
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,610
124 meters ahead of you, commanding heights.

439
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:08,930
That's your last sniper position.

440
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:10,400
Roger that

441
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:33,450
It's too far away.

442
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,240
Let me help you.

443
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:45,640
I'll hold this head down.

444
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,760
You run up.

445
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,330
Can you jump over the door panel?

446
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:49,330
Yes

447
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,810
But with my weight,

448
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:51,730
you can't bear it at all.

449
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:55,520
The target is about to escape.

450
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:56,810
The estimated time is 20 seconds.

451
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:57,760
nineteen

452
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,850
We're running out of time.

453
00:25:58,850 --> 00:25:59,240
eighteen

454
00:25:59,240 --> 00:25:59,880
Trust me

455
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:00,970
seventeen

456
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:02,810
sixteen

457
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:04,730
fifteen

458
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:06,240
Hold on.

459
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:06,850
Yinti, come on

460
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:08,640
Yinxiang

461
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:10,490
twelve

462
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:15,400
Shiyi

463
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,330
Ten

464
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:18,880
Nine

465
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,520
Eight

466
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:22,090
Seven

467
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:23,690
Six

468
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:25,090
Five

469
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:26,760
Four

470
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,490
Three

471
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:30,000
Two

472
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:31,400
One

473
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,210
What do you think?

474
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,120
Did you hit it?

475
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,210
He's really good.

476
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,690
He's really great.

477
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:31,490
commander, I'm sorry.

478
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:33,280
Well, I was excited just now.

479
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,240
It's really good.

480
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,280
You make it sound like your soldiers.

481
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:40,160
Yours

482
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:41,280
Yours

483
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:49,850
Xu Dongdong,

484
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,040
go down.

485
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,360
Untie the hostage's electronic bracelet.

486
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:53,930
This person is yours.

487
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,330
The next one is mine.

488
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,210
This is yours.

489
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:07,850
Nice

490
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:09,850
Lin Yi

491
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,760
Thank you.

492
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,160
I'll help you next.

493
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:14,040
Xu Dongdong rescued a hostage.

494
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:15,040
Success in promotion.

495
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:42,640
Wang Yu was promoted successfully.

496
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,690
Tong Mengyao succeeded in killing the terrorists

497
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,760
and rescuing the hostages.

498
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,450
Chen Haozhe is promoted.

499
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:50,690
Du Xinyu advanced.

500
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:54,090
Lin Yi advanced successfully.

501
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,400
Li Sisi killed the terrorists.

502
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,570
The rescue of the hostages was successful.

503
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,400
Guo Xiaowei was promoted successfully.

504
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:07,090
Please note that

505
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,280
there is still one left.

506
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,570
The last hostage, Ning Meng,

507
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,360
thank you for helping me just now.

508
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:15,240
Otherwise, I would have been eliminated.

509
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,330
It would be a shame

510
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,120
if you were eliminated.

511
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,810
About the target report last time.

512
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,120
You're talking about two bombs and one heart.

513
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,880
I turned it over a long time ago.

514
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:26,850
I won't mention it again.

515
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:28,330
Not bad.

516
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,640
I can't tell you're quite magnanimous.

517
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:31,880
There's only one hostage left.

518
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,640
Let me help you.

519
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,360
Are your feet okay?

520
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,120
It's okay

521
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:48,690
Lin Yi

522
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,160
Very handsome.

523
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:56,400
Dongdong

524
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:57,400
Well done.

525
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,360
The three of us finally made it.

526
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:00,160
Give me a high five.

527
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:00,490
Come on

528
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,240
Lin Yi is here, too.

529
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,730
There's only one hostage left.

530
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,090
I'm going to study it.

531
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:07,810
Their tactics.

532
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:08,690
Do you want to go with me?

533
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,640
We're not going.

534
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:10,610
Go by yourself.

535
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,330
Okay

536
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:13,730
Me

537
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,760
Let me go if it's a good chance.

538
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,610
Liang Weili hasn't advanced yet.

539
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,570
We have to help her.

540
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:21,330
You're so good. I'll leave it to you.

541
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:22,280
I went to

542
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,490
Liang Weili

543
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:48,880
Liang Weili Where are you?

544
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:49,690
Tong Mengyao,

545
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:50,810
what the hell are you doing?

546
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,330
Sister, the job is done.

547
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,000
Now I'll help you advance together.

548
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:55,210
Great.

549
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,330
You're really a good sister.

550
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,760
How are you going to help me?

551
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:58,970
I got a drone.

552
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,240
Looking for the whereabouts of the hostages.

553
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,880
There's only one hostage left.

554
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,490
Whoever finds it will advance?

555
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:05,240
It can save you.

556
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,120
You can eliminate Ning Meng

557
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,210
and kill two birds with one stone.

558
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:08,930
Don't talk nonsense.

559
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,570
It affects internal unity.

560
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,160
We're good soldiers.

561
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,450
Enough

562
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:14,280
Stop pretending to be pure.

563
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,090
Captain can't hear you.

564
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,450
Our channel is encrypted.

565
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,810
This is our special line.

566
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:23,930
The hostage has been found.

567
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:24,570
Not far from you.

568
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:25,160
Stay where you are.

569
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,090
The hostage can still come to me by himself.

570
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,160
Then leave it alone.

571
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,330
Send me your coordinates.

572
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,490
The Lost Unmanned Aerial Vehicle One.

573
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,730
Are you still offline?

574
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:41,730
Yes

575
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,450
We haven't found out if it's a natural fault.

576
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,970
Hurry up and make sure.

577
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,570
Yes

578
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,000
Lin Yi

579
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:51,330
I'm here.

580
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,240
Why are you here?

581
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:54,490
I think your tactics are so good.

582
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:55,760
I want to watch and learn from you.

583
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:58,090
Self-motivated is a good thing.

584
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:02,210
Wait a minute.

585
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,490
What happened to this face?

586
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,160
It's so dirty.

587
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:07,640
How dirty it is!

588
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,360
Wait a minute.

589
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:13,210
Why is it so serious?

590
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:14,880
Did you just help me?

591
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,850
I got it when I was on a springboard.

592
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:16,210
Does it hurt?

593
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:16,850
It's okay

594
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,360
Let me bandage it for you.

595
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:21,120
Are you okay?

596
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:22,730
It's okay. It's okay.

597
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:25,690
There is no soldier who doesn't bump into each other.

598
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:26,610
Not so delicate.

599
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,730
I think we should deal with it.

600
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,690
Wait a minute. It's inflamed.

601
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:30,730
It won't be good if it affects the assessment.

602
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,240
Fine

603
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:31,930
Don't dawdle,

604
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,280
you clean your face.

605
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,330
I'll bandage the wound.

606
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,000
Let's go

607
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:40,930
Okay

608
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:54,240
Tong Mengyao,

609
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:55,640
where are the hostages?

610
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:57,690
Why can't I see anything?

611
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:58,850
Liang Weili,

612
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,970
wait a little longer.

613
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,570
I'll bring you the hostages right away.

614
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,210
Tong Mengyao,

615
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,120
the hostage can still listen to you.

616
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:07,360
Are you the captain?

617
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,570
Don't fool me

618
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:09,880
at this critical moment.

619
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,640
Liang Weili,

620
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:11,760
we have been classmates for so long.

621
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,520
Don't you trust me?

622
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:15,160
Just wait and get a bargain.

623
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,450
The three terrorists fanned out.

624
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:18,160
Guard the hostages.

625
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:19,760
I'll hit the one on the left.

626
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,760
You hit the one on the right.

627
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,120
Then we'll flank him.

628
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,450
Rush in and annihilate the last one.

629
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:24,240
Okay

630
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,240
Report to captain.

631
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:30,690
Speak

632
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,640
There seems to be something wrong with my intercom.

633
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:33,400
Request a replacement.

634
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,240
You've done your job.

635
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:36,810
Captain

636
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:37,280
What did you say?

637
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,090
Don't change it.

638
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,850
Do you hear me?

639
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:39,400
Captain

640
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:45,520
Tong Mengyao,

641
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,760
did you hear that?

642
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:47,690
Copy that, captain.

643
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:53,000
It's finally your turn to play.

644
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,360
Dear captain.

645
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,810
I use your voice to make use of it.

646
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:02,970
Fight

647
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,520
Take the hostages through the back door immediately.

648
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,280
Take the hostages through the back door immediately.

649
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,690
Execute the command immediately.

650
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:53,640
The failure of commander

651
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,320
drone one.

652
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:55,840
It has been ruled out.

653
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,160
What's going on?

654
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,010
Because someone broke through.

655
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,080
Our chain of command.

656
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,880
UAV 1 is out of control.

657
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,120
Follow the instructions.

658
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,160
Location coordinates have been sent.

659
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,800
107, 103, 431, 766 Liang

660
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,290
Weili, don't

661
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:26,400
move.

662
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,970
The hostages will come to you soon.

663
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:35,290
The last hostage was also transferred without permission.

664
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:36,800
What do you think?

665
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,160
We can't reach him right now.

666
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:41,930
Captain

667
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,160
Tong Mengyao is quite capable.

668
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,080
Don't beat the grass and scare the snake yet.

669
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:50,360
Let her continue to control it.

670
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,600
Let's see what tricks she's up to.

671
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:09,560
This terrorist.

672
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,490
He was able to easily avoid it at the last minute.

673
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,450
I doubt it.

674
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:13,770
Who is he under the command of?

675
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:18,490
What are you doing?

676
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,400
I'm going to blind cheaters.

677
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:22,560
Oh, come on,

678
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,770
lemon. You can guess that?

679
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,080
Liang Weili,

680
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:28,160
Liang Weili, pay attention.

681
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,880
The last hostage is on his way.

682
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:31,400
Get ready.

683
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:32,600
Roger that

684
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:33,360
Thanks

685
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:43,400
commander,

686
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:45,770
several drones were shot down by Ning Meng.

687
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,290
I saw it.

688
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,120
Instructor,

689
00:37:57,930 --> 00:37:58,560
you stay here.

690
00:37:58,970 --> 00:37:59,800
I'll go to the scene

691
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:14,290
Ning Meng

692
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:15,640
Don't fight any more.

693
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:16,770
It's expensive.

694
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:18,360
Aren't you afraid the captain will trouble you?

695
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,560
You can't do it without fighting.

696
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:20,600
I have to advance.

697
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:21,800
Yes

698
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:23,120
You will definitely advance.

699
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,600
Otherwise, you will be sorry.

700
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,530
These drones

701
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,050
are better than you.

702
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:33,600
Liang Weili,

703
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:34,730
I can't help you anymore.

704
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:36,450
My drone was shot down.

705
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,010
You're on your own.

706
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,210
Tong Mengyao

707
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,770
was badly hurt by you this time.

708
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:44,050
I didn't think of that either.

709
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:44,880
Ning Meng is so bold.

710
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,400
No one is as bold as you.

711
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:47,360
Captain

712
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:49,080
Who told you to cheat?

713
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:50,120
Captain

714
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:51,490
Send me the computer.

715
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,160
Is it not to let me play my specialty?

716
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:56,320
Are you satisfied with my ability?

717
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,250
You call the war room drone.

718
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,320
It's what I expected.

719
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,320
But did I ask you to help Liang Weili cheat?

720
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,080
Captain.

721
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:05,530
What are you going to do with me?

722
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,560
You're not going to vote me out, are you?

723
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,290
Since you're so energetic,

724
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:10,560
run back to camp.

725
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:12,640
Run back.

726
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:13,880
Captain, it's too far away.

727
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:14,210
Me

728
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:15,160
You can run if you don't want to.

729
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,640
Go back to your original unit.

730
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,640
I'll call a car for you.

731
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,490
No, no, captain.

732
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:19,360
I'm going back now.

733
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,160
Captain, I'm going back now.

734
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:25,880
Tong Mengyao withdrew from the exercise

735
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:26,770
in violation of the rules of the exercise.

736
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,560
It's such a trick.

737
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:31,250
I have to rely on myself this time.

738
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,730
It wasn't my order.

739
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,450
You have the last hostage with you.

740
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,730
Go to Workshop 3.

741
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:51,210
Roger that

742
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,290
Ning Meng

743
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:08,450
You walk too slowly.

744
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:09,490
What if someone else

745
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,320
saves the last hostage.

746
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,530
We'll lose all our previous efforts.

747
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,010
Then I'll go faster.

748
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:14,530
Forget it

749
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:15,600
How about this

750
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,160
I'll scout ahead first.

751
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:18,320
If you find anything,

752
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,320
I'll let you know as soon as possible.

753
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:21,530
Thank you

754
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:22,160
Be careful.

755
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,970
I have no animosity towards you.

756
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:07,530
I want to kill you.

757
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,080
You wouldn't have found me at all.

758
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:11,450
Then what are you going to do?

759
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,930
There's only one spot left.

760
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:15,450
You hurt your foot again.

761
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,450
I'm sure I can't make it to the finish line on time.

762
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:18,880
Give it up

763
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,290
and start using psychological tactics against me.

764
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,360
I'm just trying to persuade you to give up your obsession.

765
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,530
If your brother is alive.

766
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:28,970
I don't want to see my sister

767
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:29,930
suffer from this.

768
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:31,010
You're not my brother.

769
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,450
You have no right to say that.

770
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,450
Your brother is my good brother.

771
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:36,120
He saved my life.

772
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,730
I don't want to see his sister either.

773
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,490
I'm in danger.

774
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,010
If he were still here,

775
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,050
he would support me.

776
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:48,690
You're stubborn.

777
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:50,010
It's exactly the same as your brother.

778
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:51,600
Fine

779
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,160
I'll get you the last spot.

780
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:56,770
What about yourself?

781
00:41:58,730 --> 00:41:59,770
Cut the crap.

782
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,120
I can't get into the Blue Buff.

783
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,160
I'm going back to the SWAT team, too.

784
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:03,840
You won't get the last spot.

785
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,600
Stop eating completely.

786
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,970
And I'm not doing it for you.

787
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:08,730
It's for your brother.

788
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:09,640
I owe him.

789
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:11,530
I'll carry you away.

790
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:12,360
No need

791
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,360
I can do it myself.

792
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:14,450
Ning Meng

793
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:15,210
class monitor

794
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:15,970
Got something.

795
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:26,080
Wait a minute.

796
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:28,970
There is only one door in this workshop.

797
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:30,970
There are too many abandoned locomotives in it.

798
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:32,080
The light is not enough.

799
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,010
It's hard to catch terrorists hiding inside.

800
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,080
Must be forced out.

801
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,360
To force them out.

802
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,080
Leave it to us.

803
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,450
You hurt your foot.

804
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:40,690
Wait outside.

805
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,490
You must be sure this time.

806
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:43,970
I got robbed again.

807
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:45,690
Even the Jade Emperor can't save you.

808
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:46,640
Let's go

809
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:48,360
Thank you, monitor.
