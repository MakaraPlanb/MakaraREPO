1
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:29,690
Nobody move!

2
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:31,780
There are explosives here.

3
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,850
Explosives.

4
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,330
Ning Meng

5
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,940
Look at his legs.

6
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,140
It hurts

7
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,300
Yang Shu

8
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,620
Come and help me.

9
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,380
Yang Shu, come here.

10
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,340
Get a hygienist.

11
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:14,260
Physician,

12
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,060
hygienist,

13
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:15,980
hygienist,

14
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,940
hygienist, hurry up!

15
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,060
Someone's hurt, hygienist.

16
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:22,700
Come here.

17
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:23,810
What's wrong?

18
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,410
Look.

19
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,620
This is

20
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,490
It's me

21
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:38,980
It scared the hell out of me.

22
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,020
What is this?

23
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:42,170
It's okay

24
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,260
This phosphorus fire.

25
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,700
It's the light that phosphine gives off when it burns.

26
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,620
It is said that phosphorus fire is the hair of dead people.

27
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:48,980
It has nothing to do with the dead.

28
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,290
This should be

29
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,700
the conversion of phosphorus

30
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,980
from the decay of animal carcasses into.

31
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,010
It's caused by phosphine.

32
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:54,930
These things.

33
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,620
Isn't it in your stomach and intestines?

34
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,060
You can understand it that way.

35
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,010
Then the air we breathe

36
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,340
is decomposition products of carrion.

37
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:07,010
Let's go

38
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,700
Do you want us to report back?

39
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,010
What should we do?

40
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,090
Within 30 minutes.

41
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,140
Someone who can't find his badge.

42
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,900
Will be eliminated.

43
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,140
Are you still leaving?

44
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,060
Must go.

45
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,340
You have to finish the task.

46
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,620
I... I... I'm not leaving.

47
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,980
I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving.

48
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,340
Sisi

49
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:45,450
Let's go.

50
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:46,620
Me

51
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:47,810
Let's go

52
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,170
We have to go.

53
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:49,620
Get up

54
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:50,700
I have to go.

55
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:56,900
Follow in my footsteps.

56
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,370
Well

57
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,170
Well

58
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,140
This is so wonderful.

59
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,090
This is so inhuman.

60
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,170
Hurry up and find the badge.

61
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,060
I can't find the badge.

62
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:32,980
You'll be eliminated.

63
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,220
What should we do now?

64
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:52,650
The task still needs to be completed.

65
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,130
Let's go

66
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,130
Dongdong

67
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,010
Explosive ordnance disposal is my strong suit.

68
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,570
Let me go ahead.

69
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,250
Okay

70
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,060
Are you okay?

71
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:12,820
Just give me a break.

72
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,250
I'll catch up with you.

73
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:17,540
Okay

74
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,100
Let's go

75
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,220
My coordinates are at the front.

76
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,060
I'm leaving.

77
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,220
Be careful.

78
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:36,820
Be careful.

79
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,010
Bad luck.

80
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,220
Why are my coordinates in the water?

81
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:44,850
Zhuang Qian

82
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:45,730
I'll go with you for a while.

83
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,380
Let's go

84
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:49,620
Let's go

85
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,170
Tell me

86
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,730
Here's your price.

87
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,130
It's much higher than other places.

88
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,010
Be quick.

89
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,940
And find me a beautiful one.

90
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,010
Otherwise, pull it down.

91
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,170
Okay, okay.

92
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,100
I'll be right there.

93
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:13,940
What's wrong?

94
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,410
Did you hear the sound of drowning?

95
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,170
I heard you.

96
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:16,850
I heard it, too.

97
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,570
There were also screams.

98
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,060
Shoes, Guo Xiaowei.

99
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,010
Wait a minute.

100
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,540
Look.

101
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,290
There are several sets of footprints.

102
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,130
These barefoot footprints

103
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,100
should be the owner of this pair of shoes.

104
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,380
Also, this trail of footprints

105
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,500
should be two soldiers who are 1. 8 meters tall

106
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,170
and weigh about 150 pounds.

107
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,900
These two soldiers

108
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,940
took this person away.

109
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,380
It seems that the assessment has become more difficult.

110
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:56,970
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

111
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,290
I'm scared,

112
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,780
but I'm more afraid of leaving Blue Lightning.

113
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,540
My coordinates are here.

114
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,010
But we have to split up.

115
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,170
Tong Mengyao,

116
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,970
you'll be on the way to find it later.

117
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:12,690
Pay attention to the situation.

118
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,690
Stay calm.

119
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,410
Hao Zhe

120
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:19,450
We're leaving.

121
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:19,900
Okay

122
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,060
Be safe, both of you.

123
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:22,940
OK. Let's go.

124
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,380
Hao Zhe

125
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:25,900
Do you want me to go down and help you?

126
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,380
No need

127
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,820
My location is in the water.

128
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,290
Go and finish your task.

129
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:31,900
Find your badge.

130
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,500
Be careful.

131
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,170
Okay

132
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,050
Li Xiaoxia, Li Lin, Zhu Tongtong,

133
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,860
Li Juan, Sun Lijun, and Liu Qian were listed.

134
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:47,740
You're eliminated.

135
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,220
Report

136
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,010
Speak

137
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,740
We have accomplished the task.

138
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,050
Why are you eliminated?

139
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,490
Li Xiaoxia, Li Lin and Zhu Tongtong

140
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,540
look down at your wrist monitors.

141
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,010
His heart beat over 160.

142
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,490
Such a psychological quality.

143
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,490
We don't need Blue Power.

144
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,490
Report

145
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,010
Speak

146
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,450
Our heart rate doesn't exceed 160.

147
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,690
Why are you eliminated?

148
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,420
timid

149
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,370
Slow action,

150
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,180
delay the fighter plane,

151
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,100
that's the reason.

152
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:10,690
Who else wouldn't accept it?

153
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:14,740
Good

154
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,340
Report

155
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:18,900
Speak

156
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,450
You didn't tell me in advance.

157
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,450
We have explosives.

158
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,570
Will the enemy tell you where there is a bomb?

159
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,420
A qualified member of the special operations team.

160
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,540
Rapid response

161
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,420
in mobile operations

162
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,810
is the most basic requirement.

163
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:30,980
Yes

164
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:31,930
Report

165
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,100
Speak

166
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,050
Captain

167
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,980
Two of our team members were injured.

168
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,690
His hands and legs were blown off.

169
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:39,980
I want to ask.

170
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,930
Is this allowed for training?

171
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,690
We can bleed, even sacrifice.

172
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,180
But this is not a battlefield

173
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:46,980
Ning Meng

174
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:47,860
Yes

175
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,740
300 push-ups at the end of the test.

176
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:53,860
500.

177
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,370
It will be finished in half an hour.

178
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:57,570
Yes

179
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,300
I'm Li Bing from Yanzhou Special Operations Brigade.

180
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,050
I'm Wang Jun, a retired veteran.

181
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,660
Our legs and hands.

182
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,250
It wasn't just broken.

183
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,100
As early as three years ago

184
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,050
in an anti-terrorism operation

185
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,930
we lost our legs and arms.

186
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,740
But we have not lost our honor and faith

187
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,900
as soldiers.

188
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,010
Comrades,

189
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,570
the real battlefield against terrorism

190
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,100
is so cruel.

191
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,540
It's very different from your training environment.

192
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,220
We're here today.

193
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,980
That's how it works.

194
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,900
Let you get close to each other.

195
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,860
What was the real battlefield like?

196
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,100
You can hold on.

197
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,570
I'll give you a thumbs-up.

198
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,980
As a veteran,

199
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,690
I can't be on the front line anymore.

200
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,490
But I can still use the waste heat today.

201
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,610
Make some contributions.

202
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,690
I feel very honored.

203
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,300
The future battle against terrorism

204
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,180
is yours.

205
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,540
I'm relieved.

206
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:27,050
Salute!

207
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,370
Attention!

208
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:31,610
Salute!

209
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,900
The veterans were handicapped and determined.

210
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,420
The strong faith of former soldiers

211
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,180
has always supported them.

212
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,220
A real soldier should look like them.

213
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,610
Injuries and sacrifices can't break up

214
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:50,690
the soul of the army.

215
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,300
We all know that in our hearts.

216
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,930
Compared with them, our performance today.

217
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,180
I'm not worthy of such a heavy trust.

218
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,450
Though they were wounded and discharged

219
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,010
I could see it in their resolute expression.

220
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,610
You can contribute to the army again.

221
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,570
They were incredibly proud.

222
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,250
Their hearts were filled with

223
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,980
boundless attachment

224
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,340
to the barracks.

225
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,860
Today's psychological test for you.

226
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,860
It is not only a training subject,

227
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,300
but also a wake-up call.

228
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,130
For each and every one of you.

229
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,010
Have to fully adapt to the cruel training.

230
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,810
Have a strong heart.

231
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,010
Is a qualified special operations team member.

232
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:47,900
Understand?

233
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:48,780
Got it

234
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,100
Ning Meng, stay here.

235
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,100
The rest of you will be punished

236
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:53,370
as well. Target camp,

237
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,690
turn right.

238
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,660
Let's go

239
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,420
One Two One One

240
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:00,780
Two One One

241
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,220
Two One One Two One One

242
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,690
Two One

243
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,100
The captain's training today is well-intentioned.

244
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,370
I felt absolutely mortified

245
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,450
by my query.

246
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,900
He was right to punish me.

247
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,050
so that I can always remember that

248
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,660
veterans are heroes just like my brother.

249
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,570
They can do it.

250
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,610
I, Ning Meng, can do the same.

251
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,900
Brother, I will definitely stay in Blue Lightning.

252
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,610
Just as fearless as you are.

253
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:51,810
Go ahead

254
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,450
Where is the data?

255
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:55,610
data

256
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:56,690
What data?

257
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,740
Who are you?

258
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,010
What are you doing?

259
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,540
Say it or not?

260
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,180
I don't know.

261
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,340
I really don't know.

262
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:14,980
Hunian

263
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,420
I really don't know.

264
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,660
Let me go.

265
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,450
Let me go.

266
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,010
Brother

267
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,780
You don't know anything, do you?

268
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,540
Let me ask you something you know.

269
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,250
James's partner.

270
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,490
Why do I keep looking for you?

271
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,130
Why do you keep

272
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,050
changing your name and address.

273
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:46,690
Tell me

274
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,660
I'll tell you.

275
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,180
since

276
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,130
Ever since James died.

277
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:53,900
The people around him.

278
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,300
One by one, they're all dead.

279
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,810
I'm afraid

280
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,740
it's true.

281
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,860
It's true.

282
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,220
Worthy of being a family of traditional Chinese medicine.

283
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,980
The strength is just right.

284
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,300
A little further down.

285
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:23,100
Here?

286
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:24,220
Yes, yes, yes.

287
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,660
Rub more for you, this way, this way.

288
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:29,900
Is it sour

289
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,220
or not? Why is it sour?

290
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,810
Is there something wrong with me?

291
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,420
What's wrong with you?

292
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,180
Doctor Zhuang,

293
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:35,980
come here.

294
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:36,570
What's wrong?

295
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,450
Come on.

296
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,300
At this time.

297
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,780
You should be exposed to both rain and dew.

298
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,690
Give me this.

299
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,340
Brave little land tank shoulder to shoulder.

300
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:45,370
Come here.

301
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:47,300
I heard about

302
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,610
the power of this little land tank.

303
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,340
It's really big.

304
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,180
How big is it?

305
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,250
Let me show you.

306
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:02,050
What?

307
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,540
It hurts

308
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,570
to shake hands.

309
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:05,300
Xu Dongdong,

310
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:06,370
are you serious?

311
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,220
Am I bothering you.

312
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,010
The three of you.

313
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,540
Have you known each other for a long time?

314
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:11,490
It's not bad.

315
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,250
It's been dragging me down for a while.

316
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,420
Come on.

317
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,050
She followed me and Tong Mengyao.

318
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,220
I think you even look at men's taste.

319
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,370
Have improved a lot?

320
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,180
That's true.

321
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,130
Don't talk nonsense.

322
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,340
The three of you are talking about this.

323
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,010
I can't participate.

324
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,300
Doctor Zhuang is off duty?

325
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,340
Good night

326
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,450
Good night

327
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:29,690
You two go ahead.

328
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,250
Who is the most handsome among our male soldiers?

329
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,220
The most handsome, let's not talk about it.

330
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:38,860
But there is really one person

331
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,300
in my heart who ranks first.

332
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:40,900
Who?

333
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:42,820
Lin Yi

334
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,090
Do you think Lin Yi is good?

335
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,130
Keep your voice down.

336
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,330
All you can think about is Lin Yi.

337
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,970
Can anyone remember you?

338
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:50,850
That's right

339
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,820
Don't talk nonsense.

340
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,820
I was simply admiring it.

341
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,700
As you know,

342
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:56,940
I'm just interested in snipers.

343
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,900
I've always admired and admired him.

344
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,330
What do you think of the captain?

345
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,330
I just think.

346
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,090
The captain has both face and style.

347
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,180
It's usually cold.

348
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,970
But when something goes wrong with us,

349
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,180
we care about us.

350
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,700
Tong Mengyao,

351
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,060
don't think about it.

352
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,820
It's the captain.

353
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,610
No, no, no.

354
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,370
What are you arguing about?

355
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,580
Are you going to let me rest?

356
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,330
Why are you everywhere?

357
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,610
You're making me rest.

358
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,250
The light hasn't gone out yet.

359
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:32,730
People who have won military medals

360
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:33,940
are just different.

361
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,090
What are you talking about?

362
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,820
Tell me what's wrong with you?

363
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,060
The lights went off.

364
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,300
If you don't rest,

365
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,300
the captain will know.

366
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,780
No one has any good fruit to eat.

367
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:00,580
Sleep

368
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:01,610
Go to bed

369
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,180
Boss

370
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,330
We searched the whole room.

371
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,850
Computers and cell phones have also been checked.

372
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,660
I didn't find any shadow of the data.

373
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,580
The next is the armed swimming.

374
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,090
The whole journey is fifteen kilometers.

375
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,010
It needs to be done in six hours.

376
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,010
You will be in the water.

377
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,180
We eat while traveling.

378
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,250
Yes

379
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,090
Have a good appetite.

380
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,330
Here comes mine.

381
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,010
Tell it to the captain.

382
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,330
I dare not say it.

383
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,700
Look at you, your face has turned pale.

384
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,900
How can you not tell me?

385
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:58,820
Ready to go.

386
00:20:59,210 --> 00:20:59,900
Yes

387
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:01,090
Report

388
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,210
I have something to report.

389
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:04,300
Speak

390
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,850
I'd like to report to you alone.

391
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,090
Let's talk about it here.

392
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,370
Li Sisi

393
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:18,700
She

394
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,180
Her relatives are here.

395
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,420
What relatives?

396
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,370
Why are you here at this time?

397
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:27,970
Don't see me.

398
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,370
Report

399
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:31,970
Not this relative.

400
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:32,660
Yes

401
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,090
It's that relative.

402
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,330
Stop talking nonsense.

403
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,580
This one and that one.

404
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,090
Doesn't Li Sisi have a long mouth?

405
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:39,820
Make a list.

406
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:41,460
Yes

407
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,180
Give it to Li Sisi.

408
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:54,940
Thank you, Captain.

409
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:57,330
Actually, you still care about us.

410
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:58,970
Care is care.

411
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,730
Training is training.

412
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:04,780
Report

413
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,820
Increase your training during the physiological period.

414
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,420
It will leave sequelae for girls.

415
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,730
But terrorists.

416
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,580
I don't care if you're in the physiological period.

417
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,370
They were ready to wreak havoc.

418
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:14,850
Report

419
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:16,460
We are not afraid of hardship.

420
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,660
But if we can change

421
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,370
the training method,

422
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:20,660
it will be more scientific.

423
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,210
I'm sure I can get twice the result for half the effort.

424
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,370
You've been talking for so long.

425
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,580
What are they talking about? Yes,

426
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:27,730
Li Sisi,

427
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,700
don't you know how to read lips?

428
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,010
What are they talking about?

429
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,970
Are you questioning my training methods?

430
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,580
You know I brought it out.

431
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,900
What kind of soldiers are they?

432
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:39,180
Report

433
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,210
I know

434
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,420
All the men you brought out are elite soldiers and powerful generals.

435
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,820
How dare you say my training is unscientific

436
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,580
in front of me.

437
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,330
They're talking about

438
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,060
unscientific training.

439
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,900
What else

440
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,210
are they talking about?

441
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:55,820
Even if it's not scientific,

442
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,460
who are you to question me?

443
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,010
Your way is wrong.

444
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,180
Of course I have the right to question.

445
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,330
Why are you talking so much?

446
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,850
Stay if you obey.

447
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,130
Leave if you don't obey.

448
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:17,660
Are you dissatisfied?

449
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:19,060
refuse to accept as final

450
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,300
Don't think that after two years as a soldier,

451
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,300
you have practiced twice.

452
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,780
I can't get used to seeing anything.

453
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,460
A prick like you.

454
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,210
I've seen a lot of them.

455
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,700
You're prejudiced against me.

456
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:31,940
prejudice

457
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,730
Let's speak with facts.

458
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,250
Physical strength, endurance, marksmanship?

459
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:37,780
Captain

460
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,090
I can do whatever you want.

461
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,820
But you can't question my ability.

462
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,850
Strength, endurance and marksmanship.

463
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,060
It's been so many days.

464
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:46,610
Didn't you see it?

465
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,210
You really have to be as confident as you say.

466
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,540
Compare with me.

467
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,780
You're not just talkative, are you?

468
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,250
It's better

469
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,010
than

470
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,370
thinking about it. Think about it

471
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:12,970
Spear

472
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:14,490
Dare to compete?

473
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,660
There's nothing to be afraid of.

474
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:18,970
I know

475
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:20,370
you're the whole team?

476
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,580
The most powerful all-around instructor.

477
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,700
You also won the shooting championship

478
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,540
in the Armed Police Force contest.

479
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:27,580
But I'm not afraid.

480
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:29,580
Okay

481
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,730
These two words have a bit of courage.

482
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,420
But I'm telling you.

483
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:35,970
If you lose,

484
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:37,900
the rest of the team.

485
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,660
I have to continue my training

486
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,420
according to my training method.

487
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,370
and

488
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,210
I'm going to vote you out.

489
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:55,330
Okay

490
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:56,660
Not good.

491
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,370
They said it was better than a gun.

492
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,610
Ning Meng will be eliminated if she loses.

493
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:01,850
Than a gun

494
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,090
Ning Meng is crazy.

495
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:04,610
Fight the captain with a gun.

496
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,730
Wait to be eliminated.

497
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,210
I don't think so.

498
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,330
I've seen her shooting results.

499
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,250
The gun was a good shot.

500
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,300
He never lost in the original army.

501
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,660
If Ning Meng's marksmanship is so good,

502
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,540
wouldn't it be too shameful for our captain to lose?

503
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:19,900
Enough

504
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,610
That's not your concern.

505
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,180
Ning Meng, get ready.

506
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,180
Start

507
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:48,370
It takes time to use the lemon.

508
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:49,900
3. 86 seconds.

509
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:52,900
The shooting speed is really fast.

510
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,330
Lemon Ning is really faster than I thought.

511
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,180
It's no use shooting fast.

512
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,610
The key depends on whether the hit rate is high or not.

513
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,610
The total number of rings of lemon is

514
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,090
86.

515
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:13,250
No need to compare it.

516
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,300
Pack up and go back to the army.

517
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,250
Report to captain.

518
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:17,820
I request a target test.

519
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:24,730
Is the target test useful?

520
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:25,730
be useful

521
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,060
It's a waste of time.

522
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,250
What's the use of a target test?

523
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,460
If you lose, you can still rely on the target.

524
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,660
It's not bad.

525
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,370
Testing is also a waste of time

526
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,090
That's right

527
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,300
It's troublesome.

528
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,250
Ning Meng's aim is too ordinary.

529
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:48,490
It should be a competition with the captain.

530
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:49,580
Are you nervous?

531
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,250
In our team.

532
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,090
No one dares to compete with the captain.

533
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,250
Two bullets and one heart.

534
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:06,940
Can't you see?

535
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,820
Your two bullets hit a bullet hole.

536
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,130
I didn't see it clearly just now.

537
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:18,940
Report

538
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,060
One of the shots was two bullets and one heart.

539
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,250
The accuracy

540
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,700
of Ninety-Six Ring Lemon is good.

541
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:28,700
It's really beyond my imagination.

542
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,580
Ning Meng, if you're so strong,

543
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,970
if you can stay with Blue Lightning,

544
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:36,610
how much better will our strength be?

545
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:37,250
That's right.

546
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:38,850
What are you talking about?

547
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,250
Captain

548
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,210
take one's place

549
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,180
Ready

550
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:47,730
Start

551
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:07,850
Captain takes time.

552
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,420
3. 86 seconds.

553
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,900
Captain, the total number of rings is

554
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,460
97. Ning Meng

555
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,660
is a good marksmanship.

556
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:33,130
What do you mean?

557
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,780
I mean such a good soldier.

558
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,130
I want to give her a chance.

559
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:38,850
It's impossible

560
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,330
for such a soldier who always challenges his superiors

561
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,210
to have great skills. I won't even want them.

562
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,730
Aren't they all young and energetic?

563
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,780
You've never been young.

564
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:48,420
Why are you mad at her?

565
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,180
Instructor Wen,

566
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,130
what is the bounden duty of a soldier?

567
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:55,940
Yes, obey orders.

568
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,940
There is something wrong

569
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,130
with this basic quality and style.

570
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,730
She is not a qualified soldier.

571
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,660
Not to mention a qualified special operations team member.

572
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,540
I don't understand.

573
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,540
Where do you start talking about excellence?

574
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:07,820
What's more,

575
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,820
I don't have the energy to build Blue Lightning

576
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:11,010
in such a short time.

577
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,700
Go teach her how to be a good soldier.

578
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,370
Alright, it's settled then.

579
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,250
I have things to do.

580
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:16,300
I won't keep you.

581
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,490
Wait a minute.

582
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,210
I haven't finished yet.

583
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,330
I need to change.

584
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:30,940
I wonder.

585
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,060
This was usually no less than

586
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,370
a ninety-nine ring spear king.

587
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,060
Why did you hit the 97th Ring today?

588
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,970
You're saving her face, aren't you?

589
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,540
She has no chance at all.

590
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:06,850
maybe

591
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,660
I'm really too headstrong.

592
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:11,900
Don't say that.

593
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,490
You lost.

594
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,940
But you are still proud to lose.

595
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,330
I told you for everyone.

596
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,730
What we're afraid to say.

597
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:23,180
Do you think I still have a chance?

598
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,130
What are you talking about?

599
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,850
You don't really want to go back, do you?

600
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,060
The captain was angry just now.

601
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,820
Go apologize to him.

602
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:31,730
You can do it.

603
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:33,370
Hard

604
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,130
You know his temper.

605
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,610
Besides,

606
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,580
he doesn't want me at all.

607
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:42,420
Ning Meng

608
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:43,820
Do you remember

609
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,490
what you told me back then?

610
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:47,970
You are most afraid of being looked down upon by others.

611
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,060
You said you had to climb to the finish line even if you climbed.

612
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,210
You must stay.

613
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:54,610
You said you didn't want to be a heroic soldier.

614
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,580
Not a good soldier.

615
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:56,940
What?

616
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,780
Now I want you to talk to the captain.

617
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,730
You won't even

618
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,370
do it for yourself?

619
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:16,660
Report

620
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:17,490
Come in

621
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:22,700
What is it?

622
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:26,850
Sorry, captain.

623
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,060
I was too impulsive today.

624
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,490
Have you packed everything?

625
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,370
I want you to give me another chance.

626
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,010
I will correct it.

627
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,180
I will double my training in the future.

628
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,490
I won't do it again.

629
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:50,130
Back to the original unit, you can double the training.

630
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,210
But I don't want to leave Blue Lightning.

631
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,460
Your family owns the army?

632
00:31:58,850 --> 00:31:59,540
Come whenever you want.

633
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,490
You can leave if you want.

634
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,330
I'm sorry.

635
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,540
Do you know

636
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,970
what a soldier's bounden duty is?

637
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,130
Is it in your heart?

638
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,780
Blue Lightning is a place that crushes humanity

639
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:26,940
and even despises life.

640
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,060
Is it in your heart?

641
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:31,370
Qin Guan.

642
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,300
He acted recklessly in management.

643
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,330
Brutal and rude in training.

644
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:36,900
If Lan Dian and I

645
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,660
are in such a position in your heart.

646
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,940
Then why do you have to stay?

647
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,660
Why should I stay?

648
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,490
Every bullet

649
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,700
you've shot as a soldier.

650
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,940
Every drop of blood that flows.

651
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,060
That's an honor.

652
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,370
You've experienced actual combat.

653
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:56,900
I've seen blood and sacrifice.

654
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:58,210
These experiences.

655
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,010
It should have made you stronger and more stable

656
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:02,090
than your comrades.

657
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,130
But you didn't do it.

658
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:08,900
I'm disappointed today.

659
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:10,900
Go back.

660
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,580
It's gold. It shines everywhere.

661
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,210
It doesn't have to be in blue electricity

662
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:17,820
Captain

663
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,540
I know everything you said.

664
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,130
But staying in Blue Power

665
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,970
is really important to me.

666
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,540
So I hope

667
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,130
you can give it to me again.

668
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,700
Give me one more chance.

669
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,180
No,

670
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,300
go home

671
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,370
and follow orders.

672
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,090
What are you thinking about?

673
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,210
You didn't listen after talking for a long time, did you?

674
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,130
Okay

675
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,580
I'm willing to admit defeat.

676
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:58,820
You lost.

677
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,250
Leave now.

678
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,300
Yes

679
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,210
Ning Meng

680
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:45,970
Instructor,

681
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,820
the captain just said he wanted to kick me out.

682
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,580
I know

683
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:52,370
you're like this. Listen to me.

684
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:53,490
Go back and pack your things.

685
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,850
Let's go. Let's go.

686
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,010
Leave the rest to me.

687
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:58,660
What are you talking about?

688
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,610
Listen to me. Go.

689
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,180
Hurry up

690
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:01,300
Go, go!

691
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:02,730
Don't worry about it. Leave it

692
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:03,330
to me.

693
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,180
Go. What are you doing?

694
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,300
Are you really leaving?

695
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,700
Is there no other way?

696
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,460
You told me last time that

697
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,850
Blue Lightning is your dream.

698
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,370
You must stay in Blue Power.

699
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,820
It's only been a few days.

700
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,700
You're leaving.

701
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,130
Look at you.

702
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:38,210
Why do you have to compete with the captain in shooting?

703
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,900
Didn't you obviously ask him to kick you out?

704
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,370
This is not the time.

705
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:49,500
Why are you talking so quickly?

706
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,660
I don't know.

707
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:54,050
But Ning Meng.

708
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,180
How dare you compete with the captain?

709
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,420
You're willing to admit defeat.

710
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:00,370
I admire you for that.

711
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,420
Come on

712
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,130
Go back if you can.

713
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,900
Maybe it's more comfortable in the original unit.

714
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:06,850
Why did you

715
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:09,220
say it so easily?

716
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,500
You're happy that Ning Meng is gone, aren't you?

717
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,290
We didn't tell her to leave.

718
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:15,180
That's right

719
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,940
What does it have to do with us?

720
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:17,900
Forget it

721
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,610
Can you say anything about us?

722
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:23,850
I'm leaving.

723
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:24,940
Look at this.

724
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,130
What are you talking about?

725
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:37,570
Don't give it away.

726
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,370
I can walk on my own.

727
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,660
Let me, let me see you off.

728
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:47,740
You did it for me, too.

729
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,180
Take care of

730
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,700
yourself. You too.

731
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:00,500
Take care, Ning Meng.

732
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,050
Look at this.

733
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:13,770
Let's go

734
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:20,740
What do you want to do?

735
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:23,020
What are you looking at?

736
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,570
Come on, tell me.

737
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:25,850
Such a good soldier.

738
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,900
Why do you have to kick her out?

739
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:38,260
quiet and refined

740
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:39,770
Go back first.

741
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:42,260
Yes

742
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:53,460
She's a better marksmanship than she is.

743
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,460
It's really a pity that you can figure it out.

744
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,530
Look at those calluses on your hands.

745
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:00,420
Who can compete with you?

746
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,050
Chi Chi

747
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,050
I know

748
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:14,090
when you dig into

749
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:15,130
your calluses.

750
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:16,610
Just sit there and ponder over things.

751
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:18,740
Come on, tell me.

752
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:19,900
What are you thinking?

753
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,130
Why did you let her go?

754
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:23,330
I gave her a chance,

755
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:24,420
but she insisted on it herself.

756
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,460
What can I do?

757
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,370
You can do whatever she asks you to do.

758
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:28,850
Are you the captain or is she the captain?

759
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,660
She never thought of me as captain.

760
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,770
Bubble up every day.

761
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,660
Questioning my training method every day.

762
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:34,810
Can I keep this kind of soldier?

763
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:35,850
You want to stay.

764
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:36,660
How to get the blue light?

765
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:38,900
Qin Guan, let me tell you.

766
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:39,850
In this world.

767
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,530
There's no soldier who can't subdue.

768
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,290
You can't subdue this soldier.

769
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,420
That's because you're incompetent.

770
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,260
Then I quit.

771
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:46,900
Please find a competent captain.

772
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,130
I can't complete the task.

773
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:57,370
I won't argue with you.

774
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,660
I'll give you one last chance.

775
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,740
Anyway, Blue Power has me and not her.

776
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:06,850
Are you trying to fool around with me?

777
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:07,530
Report

778
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:08,050
I dare not

779
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:08,850
Look at you.

780
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,020
Is there anyone who can be captain like you?

781
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,900
Ning Meng questioned your method.

782
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,090
Ning Meng is such a good soldier.

783
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:17,610
I think you brought her askew.

784
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,220
So I want to give her back.

785
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:25,850
Qin Guan

786
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:30,260
Ning Meng, you have to stay even if you want to.

787
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,700
If you don't stay, you have to stay.

788
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,570
That's an order.

789
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,090
Yes

790
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,570
Let me tell you.

791
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:36,940
Without my permission in the future.

792
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:38,220
No one can kick her out.

793
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,460
Go now.

794
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:40,290
Get her back for me.

795
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,260
Right away! Right away!

796
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:44,290
Yes

797
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:48,940
Come back and see us when you have time.

798
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,130
The captain is here.

799
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,290
I really have to go.

800
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,770
Or we'll miss the bus later.

801
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:58,850
Let's go

802
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,180
Captain

803
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:01,810
Stand by.

804
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:02,220
Yes

805
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:02,660
Wait a minute.

806
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,770
You don't have to kick me out.

807
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:06,810
I can walk on my own.

808
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:10,740
Go back.

809
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:13,980
Where are you going?

810
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,460
What are you doing?

811
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:17,900
Go back to the dorm.

812
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,570
Did I hear you right?

813
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:23,660
I thought we agreed to leave if we lost.

814
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,090
The result of the competition is invalid.

815
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:31,050
Is that enough?

816
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:35,050
Why are you laughing?

817
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:35,740
Your teeth are white.

818
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:39,460
I'm warning you,

819
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,500
don't think you have the support of the detachment leader.

820
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,370
You can do whatever you want.

821
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,500
Every day of your future in Blue Lightning.

822
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,050
You have to behave yourself.

823
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:47,810
Be honest.

824
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,460
Otherwise, it's no use for the commander to come.

825
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:51,130
Follow my orders.

826
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,090
Turn back!

827
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,290
Run away

828
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,020
in the target dormitory,

829
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,420
and so do you

830
00:40:59,570 --> 00:40:59,940
Yes

831
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:22,500
Don't go.

832
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,610
Sit there and rest for a while.

833
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,570
Are you satisfied?

834
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,460
What satisfaction?

835
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,810
Don't play dumb.

836
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,570
Ning Meng is really a good prospect.

837
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:44,980
The detachment leader has a good heart.

838
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:47,330
It's just to keep a good soldier.

839
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:49,900
Don't fool around.

840
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:51,290
Let me tell you.

841
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,740
It's settled.

842
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,130
Don't use the detachment leader to pressure me if you need anything.

843
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:56,020
also

844
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,460
You have a plan.

845
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,850
Ning Meng will leave sooner or later.

846
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:00,940
What else do you have in mind?

847
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:01,500
Don't think about it.

848
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:02,290
Okay

849
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,090
Let's not talk about it today, okay?

850
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,290
Why didn't you say anything?

851
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:06,530
also

852
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,940
You knew the detachment leader wanted to keep her.

853
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,700
Why did you ask her to pack up?

854
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,290
This is not maintenance.

855
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:16,290
Your dignity as Captain Qin?

856
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:17,500
Look

857
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:18,810
You gave the order.

858
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,290
Ning Meng, why don't you pack up?

859
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,770
So many soldiers are watching.

860
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,850
Where will you put your captain's face

861
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:25,090
in the future?

862
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,050
Instructor Wen,

863
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:32,570
do I have to thank you?

864
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:34,700
Alright, alright.

865
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,770
Let's not talk about it.

866
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,020
You ordered me to cook brown sugar water

867
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:38,900
for Li Sisi.

868
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,940
It's ready.

869
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,050
I'll send it to her now.

870
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:44,530
Look at you.

871
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,610
I care about them very much.

872
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,610
You're so shameless.

873
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:48,700
Don't send it away.

874
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:50,810
Love to drink or not.

875
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:52,500
I'm used to it.

876
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:54,090
Including you.

877
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:55,810
Fine
