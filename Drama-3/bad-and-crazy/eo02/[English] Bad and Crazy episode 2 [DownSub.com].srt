Oh, there he is.

871
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,480
It's been a while, Superintendent Ryu.

872
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:09,280
Hello, sir.

873
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,600
There are many competent officers
in Munyang.

874
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:15,160
It's all thanks to you,
our competent commissioner.

875
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:18,120
My gosh, thank you. I'm flattered.

876
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:22,080
Superintendent Ryu.
This is just between us,

877
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,800
but your promotion wouldn't have happened

878
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,720
without Assemblyman Do's help.

879
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,320
Right.

880
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,640
Ryu Su Yeol. Are you nervous?

881
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,640
What are you waiting for?
You should thank him.

882
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:37,800
-Thank you, sir.
-Don't mention it.

883
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:40,800
Assemblyman Do would like to have a meal
with all of us.

884
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,440
What do you say? Are you busy today?

885
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:50,520
No, of course not. I made sure
to leave my schedule wide open.

886
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,800
Good, that's great.

887
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,720
There's a good Chinese restaurant
across the street. Let's go there.

888
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,440
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

889
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,560
Shoot.

890
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:05,760
[Munyang Police Agency]

891
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:06,880
Are you all right?

892
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,280
Yes. I'll use the restroom
and meet you there, sir.

893
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:13,000
All right. Let's go.

894
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:15,720
Darn it.

895
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,960
Get it together, Ryu Su Yeol.

896
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:34,680
Do better.

897
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:38,720
Do better? On what?

898
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,880
I watched the clip on the flash drive.

899
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:50,680
That punk...

900
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:00,840
What?

901
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:02,680
Where is he?

902
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,440
Where did he go?

903
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,440
Hey.

904
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,320
That little...

905
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,400
[Stairs]

906
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:20,320
That jerk...

907
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,680
Hey! Darn you!

908
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:33,760
What? Where's he going?

909
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,320
Hey! You!

910
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:46,320
Hey! Stop!

911
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:49,720
Do Yu Gon!

912
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:57,960
No...

913
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:03,320
No, don't.

914
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,720
No!

915
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,080
[You still don't get it?]

916
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:50,200
[Now, do you see]

917
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,480
[who I am?]

918
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:22,480
You lunatic!

919
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,760
[Bad, Evil, Crazy]

920
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:00,560
[Bad and Crazy]

921
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,720
-That punk.
-Hey, Ryu Su Yeol! Get him!

922
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,760
What the heck did you do to me?

923
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,120
-Get him!
-Darn it.

924
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:11,360
[This wouldn't have happened
had you told me what was going on.]

925
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,320
You'll die at this rate.

926
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,880
-Hey!
[-I told you it wasn't a dream.]

927
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,800
-He's not real!
-He's not real!

928
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:18,960
No...

929
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:20,440
You're that cop, aren't you?

930
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:21,760
You lunatics!

931
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:23,800
[If you indeed caught a shark,]

932
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:26,360
it'll sink the boat you're on.
Don't you know that?

933
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,360
[Who brought Jeong Yu Na's corpse here?]
