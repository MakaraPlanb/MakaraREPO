as people kept saying he was the best.

00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,720
But the location seems a bit iffy.

522
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,120
That was the last location

523
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,200
where a missing woman,
Jeong Yu Na's cell phone pinged.

524
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,200
I went there to check
if something happened to her at her house.

525
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,520
What's your relationship with Ms. Jeong?

526
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,240
Pardon? I've never met her.

527
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,240
Then why did you go to her house?
It wasn't even your case.

528
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,680
I see. There's a girl named In Seon.

529
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,640
She's Ms. Jeong's daughter.

530
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,040
I promised her
that I would find her mother.

531
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,080
So let me get this straight.

532
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,960
You went there because you promised a kid?

533
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,640
A kid you'd never met before, right?

534
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,720
Right. I'm a police officer.

535
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,320
A police officer?

536
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:45,360
I'm a police officer. So I wanted to see
if there was anything I could do to help.

537
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,520
Right. That you are.
You are a police officer.

538
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,200
Well, yes.

539
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,360
-You think you're the only police officer?
-Pardon?

540
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,440
Assistant Inspector Do with this missing
person case is also a police officer.

541
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,280
And I'm also a police officer.

542
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,680
So you're not going to respect
other people's duty or district?

543
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,120
Are you going to handle
all of the cases in Munyang then?

544
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,000
Should we all resign?
Is that what you want?

545
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,960
-No, that wasn't my intention.
-Right.

546
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,640
I know it wasn't. We're all colleagues.
Let's wrap up with an apology.

547
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,520
But I saw bloodstains at her house.

548
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,360
Blood?

549
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,880
Something is off.
I'm sure someone got rid of it.

550
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,040
I definitely saw tangled hair
that was covered in blood.

551
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,920
Gosh. Blood. Hair.

552
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,600
Are you trying to say
someone was killed here?

553
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,720
Listen, Officer O.

554
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,480
Do you think
it's that easy to kill a person?

555
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,320
Do you watch American TV shows too?
Seriously. Dramas are the problem.

556
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,480
What if she was?

557
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,880
What?

558
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,280
What if something bad
really happened to her?

559
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,160
See? I told you. He's a total nutcase.

560
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,240
I'm sure you know the protocol.

561
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,920
We have jurisdiction over this case.

562
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,280
What if he hangs around there
and claims I didn't do my job right?

563
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,040
Who's going to take the hit?

564
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,320
I get it.

565
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,240
But you punched his face.
So it won't be easy to let this slide.

566
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,880
That was breaking and entering.

567
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,880
He wouldn't listen to me.
What choice did I have?

568
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,480
Let's make this work for everyone.

569
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,800
I'll get Officer O to admit
that he was wrong too.

570
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,240
-So you should apologize...
-Apologize?

571
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,640
Hey. Can't you tell
that jerk is a total attention-seeker

An attention-seeker?

574

He seemed kind and gentle.

575
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,920
Listen. He said that he saw
tangled hair covered in blood.

576

That's what attention-seekers do.

My brother said that you and I would see
eye to eye. But I guess he was wrong.

you should speak to me. Listen.

all about connections.

You're showing me no respect.

-What?
-Why?

01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:06,280
How would I know?
They didn't move out on good terms.

867
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:09,760
That little girl has her grandmother.
They're probably with their relatives.

868
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:11,880
Mom! The drama is starting.

869
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,400
Okay. Bye, then.

870
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,520
I skipped dinner and ran all the way here.

871
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:05,040
Why did you get home so late?

872
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,520
What are you doing here?

873
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,360
That thing you just put in. Hand it over,

874
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,960
and I could spare you.

875
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:14,480
It was you.

876
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:19,720
You did something to Jeong Yu Na.

877
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:42,880
[Chief Prosecutor An Seok Ho]

878
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,240
[Police Commissioner Kim Sung Ho]

879
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,160
Darn you.

880
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:19,720
You little...

881
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:25,920
Don't drive so rough, okay?

882
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:32,360
Hey!

883
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:37,920
What is this?

884
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,080
What's going on?

885
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,760
That punk!

886
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,520
Hey! Stop!

887
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,040
Hey!

888
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:06,880
We meet again.

889
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,920
Is this what they call "fate"?

890
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,840
You jerk.

891
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:29,479
Okay, all right.
Hold on. Someone's calling me.

892
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,279
I have to take this call.

893
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:43,080
Hey! My contract's not up yet!

894
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:45,760
Hey, you punk!

895
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,080
Hey, who are you?

896
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:50,479
-Who the heck are you?
-Darn you.

897
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,960
-You're so dead.
-Darn it.

898
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,680
Why are you doing this to me?

899
01:09:03,479 --> 01:09:04,840
Come with me quietly.

900
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:13,120
Darn you. Hey.

901
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,200
Hey, you piece of...

902
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:33,479
What's this?

903
01:09:34,359 --> 01:09:35,319
What is this place?

904
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:38,040
You owe O Gyeong Tae an apology.

905
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,640
O Gyeong Tae?

906
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:46,200
Hey, why... Let go.

907
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:48,920
Let go, you jerk! Let go of me.

908
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,080
Darn it.

909
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:21,120
Let go! Can't you see that?

910
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:34,280
Apologize to him before you go.

911
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:41,600
Apologize? You psycho. What do you mean...

912
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:46,520
Ouch, it's hot.

913
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:01,320
Darn it!

914
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,040
Seriously!

915
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:11,120
Hey, Officer O. Wake up.

916
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,240
Officer O, what happened?

917
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:15,480
Hey, O Gyeong Tae.

918
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,440
Who did this? O Gyeong Tae!

919
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,800
Wake up!

920
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:29,080
You psycho!

921
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,240
We'll all die at this rate.
What will you do now?

922
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:36,840
Officer O. Hey!

923
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:47,040
What? What do you want?

924
01:11:58,840 --> 01:11:59,920
What are you waiting for?

925
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:01,560
What?

926
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:04,160
What do you want me to do? You psycho!

927
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:06,160
Jeez, you're a real moron.

928
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,280
You piece of...

929
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:04,040
[It's nice to meet you, Ryu Su Yeol.]

930
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:48,760
[Bad and Crazy]

931
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:49,640
[Heart Mender]

932
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:50,600
You see, there's this lunatic.

933
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:54,040
[He shows up out of the blue
and attacks me for no reason.]

934
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:56,680
You're a cop. Why can't you catch him?

935
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,680
Take a normal road at least!

936
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:06,120
Why did O Gyeong Tae kill Jeong Yu Na?

937
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,000
[O Gyeong Tae being the killer]

938
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,920
will help you out too.
Don't you realize that?

939
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:11,520
[Who are you?]

940
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:15,040
[I came to punish
all the rotten scumbags.]

941
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:16,560
[The last of this era!]

942
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:17,880
Hey!

943
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,200
[The last hero.]
