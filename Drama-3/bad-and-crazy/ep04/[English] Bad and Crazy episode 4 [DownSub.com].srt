00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,520
In this situation, it'll be hard for you

184
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,800
to prove your innocence
no matter what you do.

185
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,560
And as you know,

186
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,760
we can't even ask for backup.

187
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,640
I must've put you in a bind.

188
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,680
Thank you for helping me.

189
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,800
And I'm sorry.

190
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,560
You were the only person I could think of.

191
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,080
Why are you thanking me?

192
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,560
You're the one
who's being falsely accused of murder.

193
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,800
Why worry about me?

194
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,720
They're accusing someone like you
of murder. Aren't you angry?

195
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,440
Don't be so naive!

196
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,560
I'm sorry.

197
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,600
You're sorry?

198
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,360
Right.

199
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,600
The powerless must apologize
and beg on their knees.

200
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,040
[If you indeed caught a shark,]

201
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,760
it will bite the bait
and sink the boat you're on.

202
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,120
Don't you know that?

203
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,040
[Staying on a boat with a hole
will only cost you your life.]

204
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,640
What about the boat you're on? Is it safe?

205
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,560
You mean,
I have to leave the police force?

206
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,440
Then what?
Were you planning to stay there?

207
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,720
A big company... That'd be great.
Thank you.

208
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,360
Thank you, sir.

209
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,640
Hello. It's me,

210
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,480
Mr. Assemblyman.

211
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,040
You woke up.

212
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,160
That's too bad.

213
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,600
Who are you?

214
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,480
Senior Inspector Ryu.

215
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,280
Don't tell me...

216
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,520
No, right?

217
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,160
That can't be.

218
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,240
You...

219
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,640
How could you do this to me?

220
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,640
No one will come here
until the crack of dawn, sir.

221
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,840
Until the crack of dawn...

222
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,200
Then we don't have much time.

223
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,600
Wait outside.

224
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,280
Mr. O Gyeong Tae.

225
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,800
We finally meet.

226
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,599
My, they say that people
who are destined to meet will do so.

227
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,599
Have a seat. Let's talk.

228
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,440
Sit down.

229
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,240
Sit down.

230
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,960
Sit down!

231
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,520
Good. Much better.

232
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,560
Let me ask you something.

233
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,040
Mr. O, why are you doing this to me?

234
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,000
Why do you have to

235
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,880
stress me out like this?

236
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,080
Jeong Yu Na.

237
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,560
You killed her, didn't you?

238
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,520
Mr. O, are you still

239
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,080
curious about that?

240
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,120
-No, I did not.
-What?

241
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,400
I did not kill her.

242
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,600
That woman...

243
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,680
I don't know her at all.

244
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,800
-But you said yourself that--
-Right.

245
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,560
Did you hear me say
that I killed that woman?

246
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,520
No, right?

247
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,120
You have nothing.

248
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,400
Otherwise, you would've gone
to the police right away.

249
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,280
Am I wrong?

250
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,880
Let go!

251
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,400
This is the voice recorder, sir.

252
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,560
Hey.

253
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,800
Do you think I tracked you down
because I was scared of this?

254
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,160
You really don't want to give up, do you?

255
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,960
That's why I tracked you down.

256
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,000
Because you seemed to have
no interest in giving up whatsoever.

257
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,200
I figured you could use my help.

258
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,200
Superintendent Ryu, see that over there?
Pull one out.

259
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,280
What are you waiting for?

260
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,520
We don't have time.

261
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,600
Stay still, you punk.

262
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,400
Thanks.

263
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:14,080
All right. Let's hurry
so we can make it to the 18th hole.

264
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,040
First, here's my tee shot!

265
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,640
Don't move! Why would you move?

266
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,760
Stay still. Get ready for my driver shot.

267
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,160
All right. I told you to stay still.

268
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,360
Why must you keep moving
when I clearly told you to stay still?

269
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,240
-Is it working?
-Yes, all looks good.

270
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,240
Great.

271
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,880
Hey, this is not a good idea.
It's too dangerous.

272
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,600
We have no idea what that scumbag will do.

273
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,160
Officer O, are you really sure about this?

274
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,320
I'm the one who started this,
so I should get it all sorted out.

275
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,960
Why won't you listen to me?

276
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,360
How dare a mere police officer
try to get smart with me?

277
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,240
-You little piece of...
-No, please!

278
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,680
What are you doing?

279
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,920
Let go!

280
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,880
How dare you try to stop me, you punk!

281
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,640
If you hit him more with this, he'll die.

282
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,120
What?

283
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,320
Darn, you clever punk.

284
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,440
Okay, you stay out of this!

285
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,320
I shouldn't kill him. If he dies,

286
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,000
things will get very complicated.

287
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,440
What are you doing?

288
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,800
I will...

289
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,320
I will take you down at all costs.

290
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,480
-What?
-I will uncover the truth.

291
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,760
I will fight to the end...

292
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,920
Okay, fine.

293
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,120
We shall take this to the end today.

294
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,400
All the way to the end!

295
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,760
Let's do it!

296
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,160
-Darn it. I'm moving in.
-Hey! No.

297
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,320
Why not? He'll kill that kid at this rate.

298
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,560
If we move in now,

299
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,400
Do Yu Gon will only be charged
with assaulting Officer O.

300
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,280
Let's do that!

301
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,720
Even if I die,

302
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,960
the truth will come out in the end.

303
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,600
That you were the one
who killed Jeong Yu Na.

304
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,240
The fact that you're a murderer...

305
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,280
Darn you.

306
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,240
Enough! Shut it!

307
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,080
That's enough! Stop!

308
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,120
I have no idea

309
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,400
why I killed that woman!

310
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,360
I'm sure I killed her
because she deserved to die, right?

311
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,320
Why would I kill her for no reason?

312
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,640
Why don't you go ask her?
You stubborn jerk!

313
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,920
Hey.

314
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,760
I'll kill you today
so you can go ask her yourself.

315
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,560
You're finished, you scumbag!

316
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,440
What the heck? Are you out of your mind?

317
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,200
Hey, Officer O.

318
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,040

What are you waiting for? Kill them both!

Go...

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,400

-No matter what.
-Officer O.

I promise you
that I will catch that scumbag.

Hey, I heard you were a good fighter.

339
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,080
Show me.

Darn it.

What? I can't believe
you got punched right off the bat.

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,760
Aren't you a good fighter? Was it a lie?

343
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,240
Darn it.

00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,200
Nice.

Jeez.

Because of you,

this place reeks of garbage!

I want to beat you to death,
but I'm too busy at the moment.

356
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,280
Let's not forget each other though.

357
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,160
Shoot.

I'll take it from here.

It's a drug known as "Pupil".

537

The cartel's influence in our district

539

But they're still a new player
in the industry,

540
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,720

541

their distribution channels first,

00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,440
What are you talking about?

710
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:32,800
Please cooperate.

711
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:38,120
You used to work
for the citizens of this country.

712
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,360
So you want to know who sold this to me?

713
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:59,240
Tak Min Su. I bought it from that jerk.

714
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,760
You scumbag!

715
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:03,440
Oh, maybe not.

716
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,160
-Oh, boy.
-Grab it right here.

717
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:13,200
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

718
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,120
-Let's go.
-Is someone moving into this building?

719
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,960
-Jeez, please move aside.
-My gosh.

720
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,640
Look. Your boss told me
he'd knock it down by 30,000 won.

721
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,320
Your boss already approved it.
Why are you saying you can't do it?

722
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,200
Whatever. Why must you make me
say the same thing over and over?

723
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,600
Su Yeol, what's going on here?

724
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,840
This was the only day
the movers had available.

725
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,200
I can't control stuff like that.

726
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:35,080
Wait, careful!
Please be careful with that.

727
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,000
Sorry, this is expensive.

728
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,760
You can start with this.
To Unit 302, please.

729
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,640
-Hey, what's going on?
-All right, give me a minute.

730
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:45,800
Goodness.

731
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,640
Oh, boy. What is all this
in this tiny apartment?

732
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,680
Mom, how many times have I told you
to get a plumber in?

733
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,560
It's been broken forever.
The water pressure is so low.

734
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,160
Why are you nagging me
after suddenly moving into my place?

735
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,920
What? Your place?

736
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,560
Mom, I bought you this apartment
with my money.

737
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,640
But you bought it under my name,
so it's mine.

738
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,400
Don't you dare tell me that it's yours.

-Take it off!
-Hang on.

744
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,240
Hey, how long
are you planning to stay here?

745
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,960
Fine, less than a month.
I'll move out very soon.

746
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,320
Don't be rude.

747
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,360
Be respectful!

00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,600
Okay, just hold out. I need to hold out.

750
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,520
Well done.

751
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:05,440
Everyone in the Anti-Corruption Unit
did a great job once again.

752
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,960
I'm stoked, but let's stay focused.

753
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,120
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

754
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,160
Hey, Su Yeol. What are you doing?

755
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,360
Why are you all spaced out?

756
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:17,400
No, I was listening.

757
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,360
An increase in the number of complaints
is to be expected after an election,

758
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,560

Hey! You jerk!

763
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,040
Hey.

764
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:55,560
-Can we please respect
-Wow!

each other's privacy?

766
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:06,200
Hey, do you enjoy
following me around wherever I go?

767
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,120
Don't you want to live your own life?

768
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,680
Not by following around a loser like me.

769
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,480
Don't you want to live
the life that you want?

770
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,640
How?

771
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:22,360
We'll come up with a set schedule.

772
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,600
Okay.

773
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:28,320
If I must share my body and time with you,

774
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,680
I'll be generous

775
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,200
-and give you four hours.
-Four hours?

776
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,320
That's right. From midnight to 4 a.m.

777
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,000
Darn it.

778
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,320
Jeez! Can you at least warn me
before you hit me?

779
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,280
Okay, fine.

780
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:51,480
Then from midnight to sunrise
is all yours.

781
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,200
-But daytime is all mine.
-I'll take daytime.

782
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:58,920
I'm bleeding!

783
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,400
My mom has nothing saved up for her
retirement, and my brother is clueless.

784
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,920
And thanks to you, my money is all gone.

785
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,320
I need to work, okay?

786
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,040
But come midnight,

787
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,760
you can do whatever you want.

788
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,800
You said you wanted to punish bad guys.

789
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,200
In this area...

790
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:25,960
No. There are so many bad guys
in this world. You can punish them all!

791
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,600
How can I trust you though?

792
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:37,480
[If you want to,
you can see everything I'm up to.]

793

[Everything? All of it?]

00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,880
[We'll hook up a camera to my watch.]

[You can watch my every move.]

796
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:48,440
When it comes to stuff like this,
Mr. Jeong here is number one in Korea.

797
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:51,240
-He's the best.
-I can't give you a discount.

798
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,880
This can record audio too, right?

799
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,880
I even used a NASA-grade camera, okay?

800
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,920
[This is too sudden.]

I understand that you're flustered,

803

but we received a tip that
someone's been leaking info on crackdowns.

804
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,600
Please understand. Put it in this bag.

If you get caught texting someone now,

808
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,040
you'll be officially investigated.

809
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,680
[We confiscated all the phones
at Samgyeong Substation.]

810
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,040
Hey, Jae Seon. Yes.

811
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,480
I see.

812
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,160
Oh, just wait here and be on standby?

813
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:41,640
Sure,
that's what we do all the time anyway.

814
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:44,480
Okay, I'll wait here.

815
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,760
You idiot,
I'm way more clever than you are.

816
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,760
Oh, this is nice.

817
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:06,840
What's your deal?

818
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,080
What do you think? Here, look.

819
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,320
What? You think you're in trouble
because I'm here

820
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,200
instead of the cops you see all the time?

821
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,320
Go and tell Detective Im
that Superintendent Ryu Su Yeol is here.

822
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,680
Go on. Hurry.

823
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:21,640
Go!

824
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,880
Jeez, I feel like a peasant
whenever I see stuff like this.

825
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,520
You were investigated
for taking a petty bribe.

826
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,960
When did you become so rich?

827
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,920
This isn't mine. I'm just the manager.

828
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,680
Hey, don't pour me one. I'm on duty now.

829
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,280
It's okay. I haven't seen you in so long.
Let's drink.

830
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:45,320
Goodness. Look at you crossing the line
now that you've left the force.

831
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:47,760
Well...

832
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,000
Bring me the ledger.

833
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,680
Come on. Don't be like that.

834
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,120
Ryu! Come on.

835
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,120
Chief Kim Ji Min
of Samgyeong Substation...

836
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:00,040
And who else? The guys who took bribes
for giving you a heads-up about the raid.

837
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,520
Just give me two names.

838
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:06,640
You're right. I failed to take care of
the one whom I really should have. Right?

839
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:09,960
Ta-da.

840
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,720
You got the wrong idea, man. You know?

841
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,280
I only covered up your investigation

842
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:26,240
because I knew your situation
and wanted you to get

843
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,000
a nice severance package. That's all.

844
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,960
Did you think I did it
for some chump change?

845
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,560
You're making me feel

846
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,760
so dirty if you thought I would turn
a blind eye to corruption for money!

847
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,800
Fine. That's not enough. Right?

848
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:44,760
Ta-da.

849
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,440
What?

00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,800
Hey. What's gotten into you?

851
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:20,080
Ryu Su Yeol, what are you doing?

852
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,560
Hey. Did I not pay you enough?

853
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,120
Then you should have told me earlier!

854
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,120

Darn it.

857
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,280
I got a call
from Detective Im this morning.

858
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,040
He'd kill me
if I didn't give back the ledger.

859
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,760
I didn't remember seeing any ledger.

860
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:52,960
But the ledger was right next to me.

861
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,520
This jerk hid a recording device
in my phone.

862
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,720
And he went back there at dawn
and destroyed them!

863
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:00,840
That jerk...

864
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,560
I get that you must've been shocked.

865
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,760
But you can't come here without
an appointment. I don't do walk-ins.

866
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,640
You're the only person I can vent on.

867
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,760
That nasty jerk.
How dare he stab me in the back?

868
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:15,880
How dare you!

869
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:23,080
Mr. Ryu. Let me be honest here.

870
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,880
Why don't you quit your job
and focus on your treatment?

871
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,720
Right. You want me to get treated?

872
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,600
After blowing up my entire savings?

873
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:33,440
I should treat my mental disorder
and get fired? Is that it?

874
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,040
Fine. I'll go to a psychiatric hospital.
And you'll go to prison.

875
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,880
Is that what you want? Are you kidding me?

876
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,320
You think I'm playing right now?

877
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,480
This is driving me crazy! Come on.
I'm about to lose my...

01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:24,760

1059
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:25,840

1060
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:27,680
[My gut tells me...]

1061
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,120
-What did you say?
-Watch your mouth!

1062
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:32,560

is in the Narcotics Unit.]
