report her own father to the police.

357
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,360
Yes, hello.

358
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,480
[This is Sin Ju Hyeok,
the therapist at the shelter.]

359
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,200
You're not here yet.

360
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,280
Can you not make it today?

361
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,320
Right, I was meaning to call you
but totally forgot.

362
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,400
I have some time tomorrow afternoon.

363
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,880
Would that work for you?

364
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,040
Tomorrow? I'm investigating
an important case at the moment,

365
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,760
so it'll be hard.

366
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,760
I see.

367
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,520
Then feel free to visit me here anytime.
I'll be waiting.

368
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,680
[But why do you keep
looking at other places?]

369
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,000
[Do you see anyone else here
other than us?]

370
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,360
[No.]

371
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,560
[Supermarket, Vegetables and Fruits]

372
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,880
This place is a 40-minute drive away
from her place.

373
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,760
I wonder why she came all the way here
just to get this.

374
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,800
I'm sure she wanted
to plan every step of the murder at first.

375
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,680
She must've wanted to hide
where she bought this.

376
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,400
But then, the drugs kicked in,
and she just turned herself in.

377
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,880
Then she wouldn't have used
her credit card though.

378
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,040
Why leave all the records-

379
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,240
Do you think it's easy
to commit a so-called "perfect crime"?

380
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,920
This is why experience is so important
when it comes to fieldwork.

381
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,920
Forget it. Just go ask
for the security footage.

382
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,280
This is the only place we know for sure
that she visited.

383
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,240
Right.

384
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,400
Darn it.

385
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,080
I have a feeling that
this will be another difficult case.

386
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,880
But in your case, Ms. Baek,

387
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,000
there are a number of positive factors.

388
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,360
You were abused throughout your childhood,

389
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,800
and we could assert that
you acted under the influence of drugs.

390
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,760
But most importantly,

391
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,680
you have to trust me.

392
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,880
Captain Ryu asked me to take
good care of you, so I'll do my best.

393
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,560
You can tell me anything.

394
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,240
Just relax and tell me everything.

395
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,440
No secrets...

396
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,520
Hello? Ms. Baek?

397
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,600
Ms. Baek Young Joo?

398
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,320
I'm sorry,

399
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,080
but what's the date today?

400
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,120
Sorry?

401
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,160
What did you guys find?

402
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,640
You need to see this.

403
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,840
-Play it again from the beginning.
-Yes, sir.

404
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,200
[You crazy wench!]

405
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,440
[Young Joo.]

406
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,280
Stop.

407
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,440
-Dad.
-You've lost your mind.

408
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,040
I'm your dad. How could you...

409
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,560
Stop.

410
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,120
Stay away from me!

411
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,720
You thought I'd stop, didn't you?

412
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,800
But you were wrong.

413
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,560
I have

414
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,160
woken up.

415
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,600
[I think the job's done.]

416
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,040
[I really feel like]

417
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,120
[I'm finally opening my eyes.]

418
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,600
[So what's next?]

419
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,680
You found this on Baek Young Joo's laptop?

420
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,600
Yes. She didn't even delete the file
as if she wanted it to be discovered.

421
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,760
Looks like she recorded it
to send it to someone.

422
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,280
We're trying to track down the IP address,

423
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,840
but it looks like she used the dark web,
so it won't be easy.

424
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,520
Her accomplice, maybe?
Was she watching something?

425
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,120
If there's an accomplice...

426
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,280
Do you think that's how she got the Eye?

427
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,200
It's possible.

428
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,920
Anti-Corruption Unit, Team Two.
This is Officer O Gyeong Tae.

429
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,760
What?

430
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,760
After not saying a word for days,

431
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,880
she met with her attorney
and even chatted with the nurses today,

432
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,400
but she suddenly broke the window
and slit her wrist.

433
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,040
Thankfully, she was found quickly.
She received first aid,

434
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,080
and they've also given her
some tranquilizers.

435
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,800
Keep an eye on her.

436
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,880
I have to go somewhere.

437
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,040
Where?

438
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,680
Why do I have to watch this?

439
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,920
Please!

440
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,320
I hate scary, cruel stuff.

441
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,520
I can't even watch movies like that.

442
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,760
-Jeez.
-Why don't you take it to that person?

443
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,880
You said you met an expert
who's super sharp and observant.

444
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,280
I can't watch this.

445
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,120
I can't go there now. I blew him off.

446
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,160
Please watch it just once.
I really don't understand what's going on.

447
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,240
You said
this is a video of an actual murder.

448
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,120
Look.
Why are you doing this to me, seriously?

449
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,360
Jeez, I can't believe this.

450
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,800
Hey, put that down.

451
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,800
No, don't. Put that down at once.

452
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,160
If you hit him with it, he'll die.

453
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,280
-Su Yeol, have you really lost your mind?
-Hey! I said, don't do it.

454
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,920
-Calm down.
-Why...

455
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,520
You know what he's like when he loses it.

456
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,640
Just watch it. Now!

457
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,600
I'm telling you.
He's dead serious right now. Hey, no!

458
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,840
Don't.

459
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,600
Just watch it. Now!

460
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,640
Calm down.

461
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,440
He'll watch it.

462
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,520
[So what's next?]

463
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,600
[What do I do now?]

464
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,200
Gaslighting?

465
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,880
Yes.

466
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,600
You see, there are people

467
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,800
who have extremely low self-esteem
and confidence.

468
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,560
Lack of affection in childhood,
being abused as a kid,

469
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,800
and exposure to violence
could do that to you.

470
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,640
And these people
usually make good targets.

471
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,280
Why?

472
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,560
Because it's easy to gaslight them.

473
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,680
But the scary part is...

474
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,120
The victims lose their sense of reality
and judgment.

475
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,440
As a result, they begin to believe

476
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,880
that what the gaslighter wants
is what they want as well,

477
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,880
whether it's right or wrong.

478
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,160
So you're saying

479
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,000
someone manipulated her to commit murder?

480
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,040
Yes.

481
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,960
Do psychos like that actually exist?

482
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,520
Yes, of course.
Such psychos actually exist.

483
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,720
You'd be surprised.
There are many of them out there.

484
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,920
Are you trying to say
that I'm one of them?

485
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,960
Maybe not.

486
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,440
Anyway,

487
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,560
find the person this girl
in a yellow raincoat relies on the most.

488
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,280
That will be the key.

489
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,840
[Heart Mender]

490
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,320
How is she?

491
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,960
She was in a state of shock,

492
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,720
so we gave her two injections
of tranquilizers.

493
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,800
It'll be a while until she wakes up.

494
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,920
Maybe she was stressed
because she had more visitors than usual.

495
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,240
Did she have many visitors today?

496
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,000
Well, I know
that her attorney was here earlier.

497
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,480
Was someone else here to see her?

498
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,760
[She was always quiet. She rarely talked,]

499
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:48,200
[so I don't recall ever seeing her
with a friend.]

500
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,760
Then forget friends.

501
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,640
What about a teacher
she was particularly fond of or admired?

502
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,960
Did Young Joo say I was that teacher?

503
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,320
No, it's not that.

504
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,720
Or is there anything you remember?
Anything out of the ordinary.

505
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,880
Once, Young Joo ran away from home.

506
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,360
-She ran away from home?
-Yes.

507
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,840
I never expected she'd do such a thing,

508
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,200
but she ran away from home
with a notorious bully.

509
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,640
Gosh, what was her name?

510
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,600
Ga Yeong. Yes, Ko Ga Yeong.

511
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,240
Ko Ga Yeong.

512
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,200
I see.

513
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,640
About that girl...

514
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,960
What's with the yellow raincoat?

515
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,760
I wouldn't be here now
if I knew the answer to that question.

516
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,880
I wonder if the gaslighter
told her to wear it.

517
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,040
-A yellow one, specifically.
-I have no idea.

518
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,440
By the way,
why do you keep following me around?

519
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,800
Because I'm curious now.

520
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,200
I want to find out
who's hiding behind that girl.

521
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,200
-Show us!
-Show us!

522
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,480
Hey, open the door. Come on!

523
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,320
Open up. Open the door.

524
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,280
Who are you?

525
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,320
Are you the delivery guy?

526
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,840
Hey! The delivery guy is here!

527
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,480
Did you pick up cigarettes too?

528
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,320
What? How come you came empty-handed?

529
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,440
Hey, empty-handed delivery boy.
You're awfully handsome.

530
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,080
Maybe that means I'm not a delivery guy.

to the same stop isn't important.

I heard some psychos

626

intentionally provoke people
who have nobody to lean on

627
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,360
and can even instigate them
to kill someone.

628
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,920
What will happen if the police
start investigating the case?

629
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,760
I think the psycho will make the victim
take her own life

630
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,360

why do you think
that person made her record the video?

00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,720
And why intentionally expose the video?

674
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,960
It was exposed intentionally?

Okay, all right.

892
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:13,600
Put that down.

893
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:17,800
The person who made you like this.
I promise I'll catch that person,

894

at all costs.

895

You should not do this.

906

Yes, I'm okay now.

909

For what though?

911
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,240
I think

912
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,760
I'm the target.

913
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,040
You think you're the target?

914
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:56,800
Yes.

915
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,760
The place where I found Young Joo
before she died

916
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,800
was the house where I lived as a kid.

917
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,800
I think she intentionally waited
until I got there

918
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,160
and intentionally took her own life
in front of me.

919
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:24,360
I think
she was trying to tell me something,

920
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,640
but I really have no idea what's going on.

921
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,360
We should find out
what this person is after.

922

So you'll help me?

923
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:44,120
Young Joo ended up like that
because of this scumbag.
