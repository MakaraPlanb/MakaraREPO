Thanks, Ryu Su Yeol.

00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,120
You helped me decide that
I should perhaps stop being so greedy

368
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,240
and just live an easier life now.

369
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,600
Seeing you act out like this
has been really getting on my nerves.

For what? It's not like you stabbed me.

476
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,920
Well, I do understand why you feel bad.

477
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,640
I'm not going to lie.
You really hurt my feelings.

478
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,200
When you told me that you were going
to deal with Kim Gye Sik by yourself,

479
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,920
I thought, "Does he not need me anymore?"

480
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,840
I felt useless.

481
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,040
I see. I'm sorry.

482
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,120
And Gyeong Tae is...

483
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,400

On that note,

490
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,800
do you have about 30 million won
that you can spare?

491
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,360

492
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,360

494
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,760
You don't feel bad enough
to lend me the money?

495
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,040

don't have that kind of money.

00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,480
-What?
-Why won't you catch him?

499
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,600

right now?

505

Yes.

506
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,880
But I don't have a good feeling
about where they're headed.

507
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,480
The storage facility for seized items
is also this way.

508
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,400

have not yet been disposed of.

509
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,639

Can you shoot me?

517
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,960
You don't think I can do it?

518
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,640
Then do it.

519
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,960

Drop your gun.

00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,640
Are we just going to stand around?

523
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,760

524

525
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,080
Kim Gye Sik.

526
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,960
I can kill a person
without even batting an eye.

527
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,200
Put the gun down.

528
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800

529
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,640
I'll explain everything later,
so drop your gun first.

530
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,960
Put the gun down, Hui Gyeom!

531

Pardon?

887
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:43,200
Then shall we talk about the most
recent incident you went through?

888
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,800
You were drugged against your will.

889
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,400
And you saw a man die in front of you.

890
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,800
And you were forced
to participate in the crime.

891
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,640
How did you feel then?

892
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,280
What do you mean? Feel about what?

893
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:03,880
You were in a situation that was
beyond your control for a long time.

894
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,720
Didn't you feel a sense of shame
toward yourself

895
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:10,920
or lethargic about life?

896
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:15,320
Well,

897
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:17,480
did I have to?

898
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:21,280
I go through all sorts of things
when I work on cases.

899
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:22,600
Then how about now?

900
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:26,360
Is everything under your control?

901
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,240
Yes. Sure.

902
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:38,400
I can control myself just like everyone.
I'm doing okay.

903
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:48,200
But why do you keep
looking at other places?

904
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,280
Pardon?

905
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,680
Do you see anyone else here

906
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,280
other than us?

907
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:06,720
No.

908
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,800
-Let's stop here for today.
-Okay.

909
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,480
For today? You want me to come back here?

910
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:26,440
I want to talk about your childhood
in our next session.

911
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:30,800
My childhood?

912
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,040
[It was Jae Hui.]

913
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:57,360
[In Jae Hui. My real name.]

914
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:11,200
[I was beaten up
more days than I had food.]

915
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:14,040
[After my father died,]

916
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,680
[I was adopted right away.]

917
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:23,359
[Like the day of my father's death,]

918
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:27,439
[six months prior to his death]

919
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,479
[are nothing but blank memories.]

920
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:35,120
[I don't know
why I can't remember those six months.]

921
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:39,760
[Why did I only lose
my memories from those months?]

922
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,439
[I don't know why.]

923
01:09:39,399 --> 01:09:40,680
[How did you...]

924
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,240
[Bad, Evil, Crazy]

925
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,880
[Bad and Crazy]

926
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:17,560
Why is your face getting red
like you're aroused?

927
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,240
No. It's not.

928
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:21,200
I'm working as your team's backup for now.

929
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:25,160
Something happened between you two, right?

930
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:28,320
[You and Lee Hui Gyeom
started this whole mess!]

931
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,760
Get rid of all the Eyes, Eyeballs,
or whatever it's called.

932
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,280
My father died.

933
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:32,840
[Police]

934
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:33,880
Stay away from me!

935
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,560
[She filed a report of
possible domestic abuse.]

936
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:37,920
Could that have been a motive?

937
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,920
So what's next?

938
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,600
So you're saying

939
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:43,320
someone manipulated her to commit murder?

940
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:45,280
[For what though?]

941
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:48,000
[I think I'm the target.]
