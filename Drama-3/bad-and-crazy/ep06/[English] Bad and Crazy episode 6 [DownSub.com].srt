00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,920
[and we rescued him.]

177
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,120
I can't really see well
even with this thing.

178
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,840
Darn it.

179
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,440
They all look scruffy.

180
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,600
Let's move in.

181
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,680
-Move in?
-Yes.

182
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,360
-Where? You mean, there?
-Yes.

183
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,600
Hey, we don't even know
whether or not he's there now.

184
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,600
What if we move in now,
and Kim Gye Sik finds out?

185
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,520
Then what? Just stay here?

186
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,960
Darn you.

187
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,080
Hey, remember Jeong Il Su's minions?

188
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,080
I bet they're all here.

189
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,440
Don't you remember?

190
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,720
We beat them up and threw them around.

191
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,240
If they see us now,
they'll recognize us right away.

192
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,800
What? We'll die
if we mess with the wrong druggies?

193
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,440
Who was the one that said it?

194
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,560
You're a druggie too.

195
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,240
What?

196
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,400
Su Yeol.

197
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,640
Are you not addicted yet?

198
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,200
-Why you little...
-Hush.

199
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,720
Darn it.

200
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,400
Hey, hang on.

201
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,520
Addicted, druggies...

202
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,960
Yes, that's it.

203
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,520
You got it.

204
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,640
This fits me perfectly.

205
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,360
Nice, sunglasses.

206
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,600
Who are you?

207
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,880
Hey, that looks good on you.

208
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,040
Swag.

209
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,240
Well, I'll be off then.

210
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,280
No, let's swap again.

211
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,360
Thanks, bye.

212
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,520
Just wear it, you twerp. Look at you.

213
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,960
It suits you.

214
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,320
Hey, I'm very squeamish.

215
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,600
You're such a weakling.

216
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,920
Hey! Take it off. I'll do it.

217
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,440
Good grief.

218
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,920
Okay, you do it.

219
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,160
You jerk.

220
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,680
You are me, and I am you.
So it means I'm doing it anyway!

221
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,000
Did you realize that just now? Idiot.

222
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,280
Are you all right, Su Yeol?

223
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,960
Oh, boy.

224
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,440
Jeez. What the heck did you eat?

227
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,480
-Can you see this?
-Yes. I can see it very well, Mr. Nam.

228
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,000
Good. Until recently, I worked
at the Southern Prosecutors' Office.

229
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,880
I just opened my own practice,
and Superintendent Ryu is my first client.

230
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,320
Since it's my very first case,
I'll do my utmost.

231
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,520
Just a moment, please.

232
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,440
Hi, Mom.

233
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,320
The sofa? I exchanged it
with a different model. Why?

234
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,600
No, don't. If you return it,
we'll have nowhere to sit.

235
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,400
Just accept the delivery. All right.

236
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,520
I'm setting up my office at the moment.
Where was I?

237
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,320
Right. I'll do my very best,
so don't worry too much.

238
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,320
Okay, I won't.

239
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,240
So the thing is,

240
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,080
in order for me to be acquitted,

241
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,400
I need to find evidence or a witness
who can help me prove my innocence...

242
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,080
Hi, Mom.

243
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,040
Of course, it's the new office smell.

244
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,480
It's a brand new office.
What do you expect?

245
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,920
You know, if you... Where did I put it?
In the corner.

246
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,360
There's the air purifier!

247
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,120
No, I'm not angry.

248
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,480
I'm working now, okay? Bye.

249
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,280
What's the matter with her?

250
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,960

Sure.

255
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,760
Anyhow, based on the current situation,

256
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,040
they'll most likely keep me detained
while investigating...

257
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,480
Go on.

258
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,120
-You should answer it.
-No, it's okay.

259
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,000
-Answer it.
-Okay.

260
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,880
Yes, hi.

261
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,800
How would I know where the rag is?

262
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,960
Mom! See the coat rack in the corner?

263
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,640
Do you see the clothes on that thing?
My clothes. They're all rags. Use them.

264
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
Use those, please.

265
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,880
No! They are rags, so just use them.
I have to go. Bye.

Yes, we're close.

I can't believe you did that.

-Don't move.
-Darn it.

295
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,280
-Here, I found it.
-Darn you.

-You jerks!
-It's the Eye!

297
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,880
Let me see.

298
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,000
Hey.

299
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,760
Hey. It's your first time here, isn't it?

300
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,800
You shouldn't come here alone.

301
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,320
Consider this your hazing.

302
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,320
Gosh, your head must hurt like crazy now.

303
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,600
Are you okay?
At least you're not bleeding.

304
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,680
Hold on.

305
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,640
I feel like
I've seen him somewhere before.

306
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,920
Why does he look so familiar?

307
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,520
If you know this guy,
that means he's a cop.

308
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,760
Take that and get lost.

309
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,120

310
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,520
Wait, hold on.

311
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,160
Maybe this punk
is really hiding something.

312
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,520
A real addict would never
give away drugs so easily.

313
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,120
Hold on.

314
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,680
Is he really a cop?

315
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,760
Shoot this up.

321
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,600
Then what? Get killed by these dirtbags?

322
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,280
Just do it and get it over with

He's lost it. Let's go, guys.

327
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,600

328

Gosh, my head...

329
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,920
My head hurts.

330

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,760
Yes, I'm leaving now.

355
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,120
Sure thing. I have the cash ready.

356
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,080
Jjakgwi is still there, right?

357
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,120
I see. Agwi is there too?

358
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,880
That's great.

359
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,200
Those jerks.
Today, I'll do whatever it takes to...

360
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,040
[Heart Mender]

361
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,920
Hold on.

362
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,920
[Lease Inquiries]

363
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,280
Darn it. Who pooped here?

364
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,200
Clean up after yourself! Good grief.

365
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,040
-My gosh!
-Move. Out of my way!

366
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,520
-What's your problem?
-Go! Move.

367
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,720
Hurry! He's heavy!

368
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,120
-Hang on a second.
-Jeez, hurry!

369
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,880
What do you want? Who are you?

370
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,320
[Heart Mender]

371
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,160
You're probably surprised and confused,
but don't be alarmed.

372
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,120
I'm Ryu Su Yeol in Munyang Police Agency's
Anti-Corruption Unit.

373
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,560
Mr. Woo Hyeok Jin.

374
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,200
I'm going to ask you
a few questions, okay?

375
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,240
Mr. Woo Hyeok Jin! Well...

376
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,960
You know Sim Sang Ho, right?

377
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,640
Your friend, Sim Sang Ho.

378
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,160
I heard he helped you a lot.

379
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,600
Goodness.

380
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,800
Forget it.
Let me just ask you this one thing, then.

381
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,440
By any chance,
did you call me about two months ago?

382
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,360
You see, I made a mistake.

383
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,600
It's related to Sim Sang Ho.
And I want to catch the real culprit.

384
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,680
There's a detective in the Narcotics Unit,

385
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,560
and he's a total psycho.

386
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,960
I have reasons to believe that
he framed Sim Sang Ho for murder.

387
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,320
Sang Ho didn't kill anyone.

388
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,760
Right? Sim Sang Ho was murdered.

389
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,040
And he's being wrongfully accused
of murder now, right?

390
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,760
-Woo Hyeok Jin!
-I didn't...

391
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,560
I heard he was very good to you.

392
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,480
He did so much for you
and tried his best to save you.

393
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,480
You were grateful to him,
so you probably wanted to clear his name.

394
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,760
-Isn't that why you called me?
-No! You got it all wrong.

395
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,560
I did not

396
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,160
call you.

397
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,800
And I...

398
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,880
I killed Sang Ho, okay?

399
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,040
-What... What did you say?
-Darn it!

400
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,600
I said, I killed him!

401
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,840
-Boss!
-What?

402
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,880
-Sang Ho is gone.
-Sang Ho?

403
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,160
Who is Sang Ho?

404
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,040
Sang Ho went to report us.

405
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,720
To tell a detective in the Narcotics Unit
that the cops are in on this too.

406
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,240
He went to meet with him!

407
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,600
I had no choice! I wanted to live!

408
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,440
So please...

409
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,960
Don't talk to me about that idiot, okay?

410
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,920
I killed him.

411
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,480
Darn it!

412
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,760
-I killed that moron!
-Hey, what's wrong with him?

413
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,400
-Hey!
-My goodness.

414
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,560
-My gosh.
-How many times must I tell you?

415
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,560
I killed him!

416
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,880
I killed him!

417
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,080
It's okay.

418
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,760
Okay, all right.

419
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,280
That was
a typical drug-induced psychotic episode.

420
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,480
Sometimes, they think they see
thousands of bugs crawling on their skin.

421
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,400
If he doesn't quit drugs,

422
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,160
he will die.

423
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,520
I don't think
there's anything we can do for him.

424
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,320
First, let's make sure
he can get some real rest.

425
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,320
He needs absolute rest.

426
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,400
Both this man and I.

427
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,120
-Okay.
-Good.

428
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,960
Well, get some rest then.

429
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,280
Call me when he wakes up.

430
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,440
What?

431
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,920
You'll leave him here?

432
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,440
Wait, Mr. Ryu.

433
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,680
Hey, Ryu Su Yeol!

434
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,960
Darn it.

435
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,640
Was it a complete waste of time?

436
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,400
Did you not hear him say
that Sim Sang Ho didn't kill anyone?

437
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,760
[Heart Mender]

438
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,880
I'll keep digging.
I'm sure we'll find something.

439
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,840
He's so charismatic.

440
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,520
[Evidence]

441
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,800
Gosh, I'm so full.

442
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,880
What? You said you didn't want to eat.

443
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,240
I know, but I suddenly got hungry.

444
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,440
Really?

445
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,960
It smells so good.

446
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,240
Hey, I've been a regular here for years.

447
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,520
The bread is soft,
and the veggies are always so fresh.

448
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,680
Look.

449
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,800
This makes such a hearty meal.
It's to die for.

450
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,360
Do you want a bite?

451
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,840
No, it's okay.
You didn't even have dinner.

452
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,760
Right. I'm starving.

453
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,240
What?

454
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,600
It's nothing.
I was just reminded of my childhood.

455
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,920
Back then,

456
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,120
my wish was to try a sandwich like that

457
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,040
because my family was poor.

458
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,480
We lived on instant noodles.
And even now...

459
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,680
-It's okay, sir.
-Just eat it.

460
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,200
-I can just eat the noodles.
-I love instant noodles.

461
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,600
Eat up.

462
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,200
Thank you.

463
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,880
This is cold.

464
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,480
The bread is soft,
and the veggies are so fresh.

465
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,960
This would make such a hearty meal.

466
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,800
That little...

467
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,080
[Evidence]

468
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,560
Sir, it doesn't look like Heo Jong Gu

469
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,120
took any of Inspector Lee's belongings
to his place,

470
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,040
which means he took care of it somewhere,
before he got home.

471
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,800
[Evidence]

472
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,960
But considering the time and his route,

473
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,520
I don't think he made a stop anywhere.

474
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,520
Right.

475
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,840
-His car!
-His car!

476
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,360
[Police]

477
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,920
Lee Hui Gyeom and Heo Jong Gu
showed up together

478
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,960
and said they'd kill me
if I didn't do as they said.

479
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,200
As you know, I'm an ex-con
who has no power.

480
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,200
So what can I do?

481
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,040
I mean, they're cops.

482
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,040
I had no choice but to obey their orders.

483
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,160
Ending the interview.

484
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,520
Just do exactly what you did now.

485
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,160
Make no mistakes
in front of the prosecutors.

486
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,120
And make sure you emphasize the part
about Hui Gyeom.

487
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,800
Of course, sure thing.

488
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,560
Wait, Captain.

489
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,560
It may be no big deal, but I think
I should tell you just in case.

490
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,360
My boys came to see me this morning.

491
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,840
They told me

492
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,280
that Ryu Su Yeol showed up
at the junkyard again last night.

493
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,520
What?

494
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,600
Apparently,
he took one of the boys with him,

495
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,800
but he happens to be...

496
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,240
He's the one who told me that
one of the junkies went to rat us out

497
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,600
to a detective in the Narcotics Unit.

498
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,400
A detective in the Narcotics Unit? Who?

499
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,280
-Tak Min Su?
-Yes, Tak Min Su.

500
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,520
-You think it's no big deal?
-Sorry?

501
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,040
This means you may not be able
to blame the drugs anymore.

502
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,160
You may end up rotting in jail forever.

503
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,840
That's not a big deal to you?

504
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,440
Aren't there women who work for you
in the detention center?

505
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,320
Yes, sir. Of course.

506
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,440
Hey.

507
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,240
You little...

508
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,000
Let go! Let go of me!

509
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,640
Hey!

510
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,160
Darn you...

511
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,280
What do you want? Who are you?

512
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,800
Be quiet.

513
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,440
Superintendent Ryu. What brings you here?

514
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,800
Let's talk.

515
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,360
[Captain Kim Gye Sik]

516
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,480
Sure.

517
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,680
About Hui Gyeom... What happened?

518
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,520
She didn't do anything. Why...

519
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,880
Right?

520
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,880
It's a rough place.

521
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,440
We want to get her out
as soon as possible,

522
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,880
but it's hard

523
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,120
because of the irrefutable statements
and evidence against her.

524
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,640
Look, Captain Kim.

525
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,800
Hui Gyeom...

526
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,600
She still admires you.

527
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,480
She's counting on you.

528
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,520
So why did you do that?

529
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,600
I thought we were working together.
We had a great plan.

530
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,760
Why must you dig up Min Su's case
