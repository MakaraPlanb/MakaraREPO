[So you're saying]

183
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,960
you want to figure out
Shin Ju Hyeok's psychological weakness.

184
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,600
As you know,
he has destroyed all solid evidence.

185
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,800
Let me think...

186
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,200
What would you be most scared of
when you're hiding behind a mask?

187
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,120
Having the mask removed?

188
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,240
Someone revealing the fact
that he is Jeong Yun Ho?

189
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,960
That's right!

190
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,600
As they say, the sparrow near a school
sings the primer.

191
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,320
A lunatic has finally learned
how to handle a psychopath.

192
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,320
So I should help that jerk
reclaim his real name first.

193
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,840
Psychopaths who are obsessively meticulous

194
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,080
often have psychological weaknesses
that are fatal.

195
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,760
Mess with them a few times,

196
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,080
and they just fall apart.

197
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,920
I think I can figure out a way.

198
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,120
Let's get through the day

199
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,120
without getting caught.

200
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,520
Hold on.

201
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,920
If Jeong Yun Ho is Shin Ju Hyeok...

202
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,360
Then who is Shin Ju Hyeok?

203
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,680
[-Move. Out of the way!
-Back off.]

204
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,160
-Out of the way.
-Move! Hey!

205
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,440
-How dare you push me?
-Hey! What the heck!

206
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,560
-Move!
-Hey, you little...

207
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,560
-You punk.
-Wait, stop.

208
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,120
Stop!

209
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,200
Everybody, shut up.

210
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,240
-Sir.
-Jeez.

211
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,680
You followed us, right?

212
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,160
Look at you
trying to ride on our coattails.

213
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,400
Hey, Lee Hui Gyeom.

214
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,200
Watch what you say.

215
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,800
Ride on your coattails?
What are you talking about?

216
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,720
We received a tip

217
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,960
-that Ryu Su Yeol was here.
-What?

218
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,720
-Goodness.
-Who sent in the tip?

219
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,960
Who would send in such a tip?

220
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,360
Jeez, my ears hurt.

221
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,800
I'm not an amateur.

222
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,560
Why would I tell you who sent in the tip?

223
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,040
What about you guys? Why are you here?

224
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,640
-Captain, over there!
-Get him!

225
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,800
Stop them! Block them!

226
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,360
-Hey, stop.
-Move!

228
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,000
Stop, you jerk!

229
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,640
-Hey!
-Wait up!

230
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,040
Wait up!

231
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,160
Hey!

232
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,520
[Hangukgwan]

233
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,560
Go! Get him!

234
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,360
Stop right there, you punk!

235
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,000
Su Yeol! Get in the car!

236
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,160
-Get him!

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,480
-Hey!
-Hey!

238
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,560
Hey!

239
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,280
Darn it!

240
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,040
Gosh.

241
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,520
How have you been?

242
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,359
Hey, Hui Gyeom! Goodness.

243
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,680
Hey, are you all right? Jeez.

244
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,400
Do you not trust us at all?

245
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,520
How could you escape
without even telling us?

246
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,200
What were you thinking?
Have you really lost your mind?

247
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,320
My, that was fun and thrilling
for a change.

248
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,280
-All right, I'm sorry.
-What? You're sorry?

249
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,200
You totally fooled us for months.

250
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,360
And what? You're sorry?

251
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,960
-Come here.
-Hey.

252
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,040
-Get back here.
-Calm down, Hui Gyeom.

253
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,120
Hey, it's not important right now.

254
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,600
Su Yeol, I didn't know
you were such a good actor.

255
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,720
Become an actor.
Why did you become a cop with that face?

256
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,320
Actor, my foot. He's a con man.

257
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,360
-Come here!
-Hey, calm down!

258
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,160
Calm down, all of you!

259
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,840
We should hear him out first.

260
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,280
Yes, let's hear him out. Goodness.

261
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,400
All right. Let's hear what he has to say.

262
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,480
-Speak.
-Go ahead, sir.

263
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,000
I must prove that
Shin Ju Hyeok is Jeong Yun Ho.

264
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,320
But I realized
that there's something I missed...

265
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,840
What? What is it?

266
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,440
Jeez.

267
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,160
My alter ego, K. Say hi to everyone.

268
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,720
It's nice to meet you. I'm Oh Gyeong Tae.

269
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,520
-Hey, well...
-What are you doing?

270
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,600
Tell him we've met before.

271
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,800
I saved his life.

272
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,560
You two have met before.
He saved your life.

273
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,840
-Pardon?
-When there was a fire at your place,

274
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,960
K threw me in there to save you.

275
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,160
Shall I profess my feelings to Hui Gyeom?

276
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,480
Profess what?
Don't you know the situation we're in?

277
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,920
Hey, I'm good. I don't need to meet him.

278
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,800
What about me?

279
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,240
He has nothing to say to you.

280
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,240
Really?

281
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,960
Well, anyway... So?

282
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,720
What was the thing you missed in the past?

283
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,120
There was one more person.

284
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,640
Who?

285
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,680
Someone else knew that
Shin Ju Hyeok was Jeong Yun Ho.

286
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,360
Who is this person?

287
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,760
Are you Jeong Yun Ho?

288
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,040
-You're laughing?
-Pick up your phone.

289
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,280
Yun Ho is waiting.

290
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,640
[That man died,]

291
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,880
but he certainly knew Jeong Yun Ho's name,

292
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,880
which means he knew Shin Ju Hyeok
even when he was Jeong Yun Ho,

293
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,120
so I'm sure they go back a long way.

294
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,720
If we do some digging on him,
we may be able to prove

295
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,800
that Shin Ju Hyeok is indeed Jeong Yun Ho.

296
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,120
About that man...

297
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,200
Even the autopsy found nothing,

298
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,200
[except for the fact that his fingerprints
were intentionally damaged.]

299
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,240
Identifying him...

300
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,080
I know that it'll be hard.

301
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,600
[But I have to try]

302
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,160
[because this is]

303
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,440
[my last chance.]

304
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,880
Even back then,

305
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,280
he was confident that he could catch him
and even risked his life for it,

306
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,960
but he ended up behind bars himself
instead of catching him.

307
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,640
Right?

308
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,120
Yes, I admit that things went haywire.

309
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,880
But to fix it,

310
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,520
I need to find out some things
about that man who died with Andrei.

311
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,520
Help me.

312
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,840
Back then,
how did you people find that man?

313
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,200
-Hey!
-Darn it.

314
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,280
Stop right there, you punk!

315
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,800
You little rat.

316
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,720
-Just tell us his name.
-I don't know. I have no idea!

317
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,760
You little...

318
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,240
We don't exchange names
with everyone we do business with.

319
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,640
He was just a homeless man. A vagrant!

320
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,840
Don't give me that!

321
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,720
-Tell us everything you know.
-Darn it.

322
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,640
Gyeong Tae, it's always easier
to use both hands, right?

323
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,960
-It sure is.
-Right?

324
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,960
The clinic. The mental health clinic!

325
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,160
A mental health clinic?

326
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,680
When I met him for the first time
about ten years ago,

327
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,080
he came to buy drugs
wearing his patient uniform.

328
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,920
The uniform was quite unusual.

329
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,160
[Yang Jae Seon]

330
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,960
Yeom Geun Su? Are you sure?

331
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,480
Yeom Geun Su?

332
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,280
The fake psychiatrist who treated Su Yeol?

333
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,280
[Yes.]

334
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,560
You don't commonly see a patient uniform
with an angel symbol.

335
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,040
[I did a little digging.
The clinic shut down ten years ago,]

336
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,560
[and he was the director of the clinic.]

337
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,960
Shin Ju Hyeok is dead meat now.

338
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,520
Okay, all right.

339
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,840
Meet us at Heart Mender, okay?

340
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,640
[Mom, you're okay, right?]

341
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,600
Why do you keep calling me?

342
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,280
Buy groceries and hurry back home.

343
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,960
[Mom, wave your hand at the camera.]

344
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,120
[I can see you, so don't worry.
Wait just a little.]

345
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,000
[-I'll be home soon.]
-Okay.

346
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,200
Of course,
I still have all the patient charts.

347
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:37,640
[Grant me the strength
to get through this day.]

348
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,440
I kept them to use
when I opened a new clinic soon.

349
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,960
They're all on my computer.

350
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,600
You have everything from ten years ago?

351
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,880
[Come on.]

352
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,800
A mental illness relapse is very common.

353
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,960
And it's not like my patients magically
recovered when I closed my clinic,

354
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,920
[so I need all the records for reference.]

355
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,200
[Yeom Geun Su]

356
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,360
This is how you do business.

357
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,200

of hearing your nonsense.

You see, back then...

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,480
Did we have another option?

514
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,199
Let's say I chose not to kill your father.

515
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,960
Then do you think you would've been able
to escape that misery?

516
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,159
Really?

517
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,320
Let's find out.

-What?
-Jae Hui.

519
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,240
You really have to accept it now.

520
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,160
Killing your father

521
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,800
was the only way to save you back then.

522
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,360

-Help!

-What is he doing here?
-Help...

527
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,120
-Once again, it had to come to this.
-Help!

528
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,840
Help!

529
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,560
Snap out of it, Ryu Su Yeol.

530
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,560

534
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,760
Jeong Hun, I can get you out of here.

00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,720
Help...

536
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,760
Let's go. I won't let you die like this.

537
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,080
It was because of K.

538
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,280
The reason you believed that
I wasn't the one who saved you,

539
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,040
and the only reason you rejected my help.

540

It was because of K!

"Save me." Now, you want me to save you?
Really?

543

Back then and even now,
I am the only one who can save you.

544
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,480

I bet that's why you're doing this to me.

589

Oh, boy. This is why I was going to
just disappear quietly like the wind.

So we identified him.

01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:17,520
Why?

902
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,640
All right, students.
You're listening, right?

903
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,360
Come on in.

904
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,200
Come on!

905
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,120
Darn it. That jerk, Ryu Su Yeol.

906
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,080
Stop them.

907
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:30,360
Gyeong Tae.
Get them on the count of three.

908
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:31,480
-Okay.
-Three!

909
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:34,640
Look.

910
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:44,960
You startled me.

911
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,480
Detective Kim, it's been a while.

912
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:50,360
Do your salute properly.
You have no respect for your seniors.

913
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,880
Then live properly.

914
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,560
You have no respect for others.

915
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:00,360
Wait.

916
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,760
Hey, let go of me. Su Yeol. Hear me out.

917
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:04,600
Getting arrested by me
sure feels awful, right?

918
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:08,040
You crazy jerk.
I'm with the Police Commissioner!

919
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:12,120
The moment you start this fight,
your career will be over!

920
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,840
The Police Commissioner?

921
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,960
Our Police Commissioner? Kim Pyeong Jung?

922
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,360
Now you get it?

923
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:20,080
Before he goes to the National Assembly,

924
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,520
he's collecting money from everyone!

925
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:25,040
How will you handle this mess?
You nutcase.

926
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:34,440
Where are you going, Su Yeol?

927
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:35,560
-Sir!
-Where are you going?

928
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:38,280
No. Don't do it! No!

929
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,360
Hey! Come on!

930
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,600
-No. What do we do? Mr. Kim!
-Su Yeol.

931
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:44,520
-No! stop it. Where are you going?
-Stop him.

932
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,120
-Don't do it!
-No!

933
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,480
Police Commissioner Kim!

934
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:59,320
-No!
-Don't do it, Su Yeol!

935
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:16,600
No!

936
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,520
[It's nice to meet you, Ryu Su Yeol.]

937
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,120
You crazy jerk! Hey!

938
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,319
[Who the heck are you?]

939
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:39,960
Who are you
and why are you doing this to me?

940
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,520
To punish those trash-like rotten punks.

941
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,840
The last of this era! The hero.

942
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,600
You're one crazy idiot, aren't you?

943
01:08:58,439 --> 01:09:00,840
-Want one?
-You were going to come out anyway.

944
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:06,880
What? Take off what?

945
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,840
-Why? Why would you take that off?
-I'm boiling! I'm so hot right now!

946
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,200
Idiot! If you take that off
in this situation right now,

947
01:09:12,279 --> 01:09:14,359
it'll look so weird.
Think about that, you twerp!

948
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,120
Let's go!

949
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,680
-♫ Kungtari shabara ♫
-Hey!

950
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:30,720
[-Isn't it obvious?
-I'm a superhero.]

951
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:38,439
[Bad and Crazy]

952
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,080
[Bad, Evil, Crazy]

953
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,680
[Bad and Crazy]

954
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:02,600
[Thank you for watching Bad and Crazy.]
