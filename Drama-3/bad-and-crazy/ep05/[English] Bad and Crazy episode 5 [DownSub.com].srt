00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,200
You punched me pretty hard that day.
You know?

178
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,640
So what?

179
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,880
Don't act dumb.
I'm sure you understood me.

180
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,560
Why don't you just hand it over?

181
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,400
Just one punch.
But I'll use my full power. Okay?

182
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,920
So tell me. Should I do it or not?

183
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,840
Fine. Do it.

184
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,240
You jerk!

185
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,720
Surprisingly, you can be manly.

186
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,600
Does it hurt?

187
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,960
I still got it.

188
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,760
Oh, right. Which date? Give me the date.

189
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,880
Darn it.

190
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,440
I told you to do it.

191
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,240
Well, he was much faster.

192
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,760
Just by 0.1 seconds.

193
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,320
No, you are slow. What a slowpoke!

194
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,680
You did that on purpose, right?

195
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,080
I bet this was your plan all along.

196
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,200
Su Yeol?

197
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,960
What? Why are you here?

198
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,320
Hey. What's going on?

199
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,120
I got the dashcam photo from Jae Seon.

200
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,040
I saw the wristband of the witness
that stopped the bus.

201
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,440
Right.

202
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,120
So you were stressed out.

203
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,360
You came here to dance
and look around. Right?

204
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,720
You're not here

205
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,200
to silence the witness
which will make people more suspicious.

206
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,840
That's not what you're doing, right?

207
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,120
Is that it?

208
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,400
Hey, why are you doing this?
You're complicating things.

209
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,000
You little...

210
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,080
Show her some respect.

211
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,360
You little...

212
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,680
-Come on.
-You already got the payment statement?

213
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,120
Darn it.

214
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,040
This is driving me crazy.

215
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,000
The numbers... Gosh.

216
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,920
By the way,
you must know a lot about clubs

217
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,520
seeing how you recognized
the wristband right away.

218
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,520
I'm in the Narcotics Unit.
You expect me not to hit up clubs?

219
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,920
Right. You have a point.

220
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,360
You idiot.

221
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,560
Superintendent Ryu.

222
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,320
I appreciate your help.

223
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,920
But this is my case too.

224
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,640
I have to catch the one
responsible for Gyeong Jun's death.

225
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,760
Hey.

226
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,680
Let's run background checks on them.

227
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,120
And narrow down to men in their 20s.

228
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,320
What...

229
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,880
Where are you going? Gosh.

230
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,680
Gosh.

231
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,800
Goodness.

232
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,640
Those two are driving me crazy.

233
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,800
Who are you?

234
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,280
What are you doing?

235
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,480
Is that you or not?

236
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,240
Come on. This was your plan?

237
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,760
Okay. Go on. You can go now.

238
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,840
Let's find him as soon as possible.

239
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,080
We must find him for both of our sakes.
Let's go.

240
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,680
One, two, three.

241
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,760
-What's up with you?
-What?

242
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,640
-Do you have a split personality?
-What?

243
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,920
Listen. You keep giving me flowers.

244
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,240
You bring me water.

245
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,560
I hear people whose days are numbered
tend to become someone else.

246
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,720
Are you dying?

247
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,200
Gosh. I'm not dying.

248
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,560
Why do you always have to sound so cruel?

249
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,600
Why are you working so hard on this case?

250
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,120
Do you still like me?

251
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,200
I like you.

252
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,040
Come on.

253
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:25,080
Seriously? A lot of eyes are on this case.

254
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,560
You really didn't know? Just eat.

255
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,160
Then stop trying to be funny,
and be consistent.

256
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,720
You're confusing me.

257
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,120
Darn it.

258
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,680
It's hot.

259
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,640
This is you, isn't it?
You're the eyewitness.

260
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,560
This case even made headlines.

261
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,720
You didn't know that
we were looking for this witness?

262
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,400
I didn't see anything.

263
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,280
So I'm not an eyewitness.

264
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,800
It was a huge accident. How is it possible
that you didn't see anything?

265
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,920
I'm sure it was pretty loud too.

266
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,240
I don't pay attention to other people.

267
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,960
And my exams are coming up too.

268
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,800
So you went clubbing
because your exams were coming up?

269
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,240
People died that night.

270
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,880
We want anything that can help our case.
Please cooperate with us.

271
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,640
One of my juniors died too.

272
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,880
My junior was around
the same age as you, Mr. Gong.

273
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,000
I told you I didn't see anything.

274
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,400
I heard the ambulance right away,
so I didn't have to call it in.

275
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,040
That's all.

276
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,680
I don't have much time, so I have to go.

277
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,680
You don't care about others?

278
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,120
You think you won't need
other people's help?

279
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,720
What are you doing?

280
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,160
Darn it.

281
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,800
-I was just...
-Mr. Gong!

282
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,920
[Heart Mender]

283
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,200
Of course. I withdrew a lot of cash.

284
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,760
Is Jjakgwi there?

285
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,680
Sir, I have a very important
appointment today.

286
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,800
Doctor. Let's start the treatment.

287
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,320
Right away.

288
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,880
Doctor. Is there a way to get rid of
Ryu Su Yeol instead of me?

289
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,400
-K?
-You really have no shame now!

290
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,800
That's rich coming from a man
who leads a shameless life.

291
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,880
I can't make it today.

292
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,960
Gosh.

293
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,440
Move out of my way.

294
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,000
So why did you have to act out like that?

295
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,240
At this rate, Hui Gyeom and Jae Seon
will find out in no time.

296
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,400
I may get fired before Hui Gyeom does!

297
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,720
Why is that my fault?

298
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,120
I wouldn't have had to step in
had you done a good job from the get-go.

299
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,600
What did you say?

300
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,640
We're in this mess now
because you stepped in.

301
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,920
Don't do anything. Do nothing, please!

302
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,840
Or just get lost!

303
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,440
I'll leave for good once we save her.
I already told you, didn't I?

304
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,680
Even if you beg me not to leave,

305
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,840
I will refuse to stay
and leave of my own accord!

306
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,160
I'm afraid...

307
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,960
that'd be hard.

308
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,200
What?

309
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,560
Well, I mean...
K disappearing of his own accord.

310
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,000
-That's probably not going to happen.
-I knew it.

311
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,720
This jerk is lying to my face. You crook.

312
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,080
Then what? Should I not leave?
Do you want me to stay with you forever?

313
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,160
Darn you. Let's just die together.
Die, you jerk!

314
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,800
Can I get your attention, please?
Both of you!

315
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,360
First off, the fact that
you are now willing to be treated

316
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,880
is a very positive change.

317
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,120
But it'll take some time.
While you're undergoing treatment...

318
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,520
Really? Then let's get started right away.
I want it done fast.

319
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,080
Go. Sit down.

320
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,400
You too. Please take a seat.

321
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:13,080
Well, then tell me about your childhood.

322
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,080
My childhood? Why?
I told you that I want it done fast.

323
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,760
As I explained before, a split personality

324
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,320
is caused by childhood trauma.

325
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,320
It's highly likely that your childhood
holds the key to this problem.

326
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,880
You said you wanted to be treated!

327
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,320
I'm not doing this.

328
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,040
Why not?

329
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,360
I won't do it.

330
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,960
-Let's do it.
-I said, I won't!

331
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,280
That jerk. He must know something, right?

332
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,880
I'm in. Let's do this.
Go ahead and hypnotize me.

333
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,840
Do it.

334
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,320
The way you always do it.

335
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,200
All right.

336
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,200
Now, try to remember your childhood.

337
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,480
You'll be transported to the moment
that comes to your mind first.

338
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,600
One, two, three.

339
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,560
[Mr. Ryu.]

340
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,920
[What do you see?]

341
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,680
[A corridor.]

342
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,480
[Rooms.]

343
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,440
[And numbers.]

344
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,600
Mr. Ryu.

345
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,840
Do you know
if you suffered amnesia as a child?

346
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,920
Hey, Jae Seon.
I'm headed back to the office now.

347
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,080
-What about you?
-Hey, Su Yeol.

348
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,560
Heo Jong Gu just arrived
at Kim Gyeong Jun's funeral.

349
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,680
Yes, I did some digging on him.

350
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,400
He gambles, and he's a womanizer.

351
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,360
But I don't think
he has any connection to this case.

352

all the evidence keeps pointing at her.

I saw another truck coming
five minutes ago in the video.

the first ambulance that arrived.

709

Hello. Yes, Captain.

710

Why are you doing this, Detective?

727

Then first, bring me the head of the rat
that sneaked into my warehouse.

Wait, Gye Sik. Hold on a second. Please!

732

Shoot him.

No. Don't do it, you jerk. Don't!

734

735

Gye Sik, what... What did I do so wrong?

736
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,400

would be much better than dying.

00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:34,280
I think I know what your plan is.

752

in the murder of Do Yu Gon.

753
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,080
And his accomplice, Heo Jong Gu.

754
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,680
They fought, and one of them died.

755
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:45,200
So now, Jeong Il Su will be arrested.

756
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,520
It's a great plan.

757

Yes. So far, it's almost perfect.

00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,480

760
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,000
But you see, if you shoot me now,

761
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,880
what about my team? Do you think
they'll sit back and do nothing?

762
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:05,360
And what about Hui Gyeom?
Will she just accept it?

Please trust me just this once.

769

Jeong Il Su, that scumbag, jabbed me
in the neck with some kind of drug,

770
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,600
so I'll test positive
if they make me take a drug test.

771
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,480
Knowing that, how could I get funny ideas?

779

780
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:05,400
I sent some money
to your brother's account.

for being so willing to help us.

783

784
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,760
We seem to be on the same page so far,
so I'm relieved.

785

But what will happen when you leave here?

with your fingerprints on it

and some mysterious money
suddenly turn up,

to catch drug dealers?

817
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,160
I believe that Heo Jong Gu

818
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:23,080
tried to get rid of Jeong Il Su
in order to avoid being investigated,

819

for Jeong Il Su.

820
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:31,400
And he killed Heo Jong Gu
right in front of a police officer?

821
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:34,880
Large amounts of illicit drugs
were detected in his blood,

822
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:39,240
so I believe he committed the murder
under the influence of drugs.

01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,560
Time's up. You should leave now.

882
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:59,240
Hey, wait.

883
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:02,920
I'm sorry.

884
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,040
For what?

885
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:10,640
Just everything. I'm sorry for everything.

886
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:20,400
Actually...

887
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,600
Do you think

888
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:29,160
Heo Jong Gu was the one
who ordered the murder

889
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:33,800
of Min Su?

890
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,440
Tak Min Su?

891
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:50,880
Min Su!

892
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:55,600
[Kim Gye Sik said he went upstairs
to catch Sim Sang Ho]

893
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,800
[after Tak Min Su fell.]

894
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:06,920
[What is this?]

895
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,280
I only followed the protocol.

896
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,320
I shot him in his thigh.

897
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:21,120
No!

898
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:25,400
[Sim Sang Ho was found under this banner,]

899
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:27,480
[but Tak Min Su's leg is on top of it.]

900
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,360
[This makes no sense,
considering the order.]

901
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,400
[But if things happened
in the opposite order...]

902
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,720
[We apologize for the inconvenience.]

903
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:41,480
[We will do our best to complete
the construction as soon as possible.]

904
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,240
Sang Ho.

905
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:58,960
Sang Ho!

906
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:01,280
[Safety First]

907
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:06,240
That little...

908
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:40,160
You... Gye Sik.

909
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:43,920
Did you kill Sang Ho?
Why did you kill him?

910
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:45,960
Even in this situation,

911
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:48,560
you're worried about someone else.

912
01:08:51,479 --> 01:08:54,399
What are you doing? Don't. Stop, you jerk!

913
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:56,960
I'm sorry, Min Su.

914
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:44,880
Something like this?

915
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:04,640
Perhaps,

916
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,960
the things I had said
to get Kim Gye Sik roped into it

917
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:11,800
were all true.

918
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:13,800
So?

919
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,160
What will you do now?

920
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,040
Will you write a novel about it
and become a best-selling author?

921
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,600
You're such a coward.
Now, you're suspicious?

922
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,680
You said I should do something!

923
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:32,080
I'm going to dig into this case again.
There's definitely something.

924
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:36,480
I may be able to take down Kim Gye Sik.

925
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,840
By yourself?
Do you actually think that's possible?

926
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:45,360
No.

927
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,480
-With you.
-Me?

928
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,160
Kim Gye Sik is a total psycho.

929
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:56,120
It'd be too dangerous
to get Jae Seon and Gyeong Tae involved.

930
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:00,320
Only you and I will go.
Just the two of us.

931
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:06,560
Just the two of us?

932
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:07,920
This moment on,

933
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,160
we can only trust each other.

934
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,640
[Bad, Evil, Crazy]

935
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:11,360
[Bad and Crazy]

936
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:14,520
Anything and everything
that could provide clues...

937
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,640
-Hey, are you not doing this with me?
-What?

938
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:19,560
-That looks good on you.
-No, let's swap again.

939
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,760
-Don't be nervous.
-Who are you?

940
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,960
[Ryu Su Yeol showed up
at the junkyard again.]

941
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:25,360
-My gosh!
-Hurry! He's heavy!

942
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:25,600
[Lease Inquiries]

943
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,920
-I killed him! I killed that jerk!
-Hey!

944
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,680
You're the one who called me, right?

945
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:30,080
[Ryu Su Yeol, Superintendent,
Anti-Corruption Unit]

946
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:32,560
[I'm sure we'll find something.]

947
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:35,120
If you take one step closer to me,
I'll have to do the same.

948
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,960
[Someone close to you
who has nothing to do with this]

949
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:40,880
Darn it.

950
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,040
That was you too, wasn't it?
