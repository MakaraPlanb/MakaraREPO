- He doesn't speak english.

why'd you give him penicillin?

00:23:44,622 --> 00:23:47,124
You're just gonna get sperm
on it anyway.

362
00:23:48,025 --> 00:23:49,594
Let's not have that kind
of language

363
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:51,162
At the table there, guy.

364
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:53,715
Honestly, donny.

365
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,198
I am so sorry, doctor.

366
00:23:56,233 --> 00:24:00,035
It's okay.
[Clears throat]

367
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:02,839
Could I use your restroom?
- Certainly.

368
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:03,974
It's down the hall
on the right.

369
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,107
Excuse me.

370
00:24:05,142 --> 00:24:06,708
What, mom?
He's a doctor.

371
00:24:06,743 --> 00:24:07,878
It's not like he's never
heard of sperm before.

372
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:10,381
- Hey!
- You are upsetting your father.

373
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,849
Where do you come up
with this stuff?

374
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:14,306
Oh!

375
00:24:14,341 --> 00:24:15,729
Sorry.

[Family talking indistinctly]

378
00:25:35,298 --> 00:25:37,335
It's just something
came up at the hospital,

379
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,774
And I really have to go.

380
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:42,179
- Bye.
- Thank you.

[Car alarm chirps]

382
00:26:53,844 --> 00:26:57,248
Okay, that's it.
Have a good day, everyone.

383
00:26:57,283 --> 00:27:01,082
Thanks.
I'll see you there.

384
00:27:01,117 --> 00:27:05,088
Blake, can you stay
for a second, please?

385
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:08,028
Sure.

386
00:27:11,028 --> 00:27:12,233
Have a seat.

387
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:20,304
So...how's it going?

388
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:22,672
Fine.

389
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:25,776
Oh, yeah? Tired?

390
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:28,796
A little.

391
00:27:28,831 --> 00:27:31,746
Happy?

392
00:27:31,781 --> 00:27:33,119
Want some coffee?

393
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:37,153
No, thanks.

394
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:41,092
First year of residency
can be tough, I know.

395
00:27:41,127 --> 00:27:42,858
If this is about
Mr. Sanchez...

396
00:27:42,893 --> 00:27:46,997
I just wanted to chat
about the big picture.

397
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:48,930
Tell me something, martin...

398
00:27:48,965 --> 00:27:50,835
When did you first want
to become a doctor?

399
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:51,934
When?

400
00:27:51,969 --> 00:27:54,971
- Yeah.
- A long time ago, I guess.

401
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:58,459
Did you know why?

402
00:27:58,494 --> 00:28:01,877
Why? Because...

403
00:28:01,912 --> 00:28:03,180
a friend of my mother's
was a doctor,

404
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:04,879
And he was respected,

405
00:28:04,914 --> 00:28:06,017
And I guess I just always
thought, you know,

406
00:28:07,017 --> 00:28:10,988
To have that respect, and to...

407
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,089
and be helping people.

408
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:15,090
[Slurps]

409
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:17,094
Yeah, people go into medicine
for all kinds of reasons.

410
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:19,063
You know, sometimes
they don't really think about it

411
00:28:19,098 --> 00:28:21,163
Till they're here,
face-To-Face with it all.

412
00:28:21,198 --> 00:28:24,134
And sometimes they realize
the stress and the hours

413
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:26,135
And the nature of the work

414
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:27,903
Aren't what they thought
it would be.

415
00:28:27,938 --> 00:28:30,056
I mean, it's not unusual
for people to realize

416
00:28:30,091 --> 00:28:32,175
Maybe this isn't what
they wanted after all.

417
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,274
This is what I want.

418
00:28:33,309 --> 00:28:34,809
I mean, I know I can do better.

419
00:28:35,011 --> 00:28:37,029
It's just taking time for me
to learn your system here.

420
00:28:37,064 --> 00:28:39,048
I mean, I didn't have
all the advantages, you know,

421
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:41,101
Growing up and school,
and so sometimes

422
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,119
I just have to work harder,
and I do.

423
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:45,087
Some of the nurses, I mean...

424
00:28:45,122 --> 00:28:46,023
Maryanne's fine,
but with theresa...

I went to school,
I did all this work,

427
00:28:50,426 --> 00:28:52,930
And she just treats me
like I'm some nobody.

428
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:56,400
It doesn't seem fair, but...

429
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:58,105
I do want this.

Hi, martin, it's valerie nixon.

435
00:29:42,445 --> 00:29:44,214
It was really nice to see you
the other night.

436
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:46,381
I'm sorry you had to rush off.

437
00:29:46,416 --> 00:29:49,319
My mom actually got you
a gift basket,

438
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:51,020
But we forgot
to give it to you.

439
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:52,957
So I don't know if you wanted
to arrange a time

440
00:29:52,992 --> 00:29:53,790
To come by and get it,

441
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:56,961
Or I could drop it by
the hospital...

442
00:29:56,996 --> 00:29:58,929
or your apartment, if you like.

443
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,428
So give us a call.

444
00:30:00,463 --> 00:30:01,963

something for me to collect?

at the hospital.

00:31:10,099 --> 00:31:12,127

- Yeah.

for diane?

the house so much.

it's Pyelonephritis.

I thought she was all better.

470
00:32:50,701 --> 00:32:54,535
It did seem that way.

471
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:57,357
We'll run some tests
to make sure.

- Get it from...

- There's one here.
- All right.

Where's the chart?

reaction, doctor?

No.

theresa, beyond her attitude,

about these things.

496

her oral meds.

from anyone else,

519
00:38:16,295 --> 00:38:18,660
I messed up
Mr. Sanchez's Vancomycin.

I switched the sheet,
and I just panicked.

I'm just sorry
if I jeopardized a patient.

522
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,434
I thought it was theresa.

523
00:38:26,469 --> 00:38:28,905
No. She didn't know
anything about it.

How are you feeling?

Is that bad?

It's nothing serious,

an extra day or two.

It's cool, man.
It's just a party, man.

547

you're okay.

549

Is there something
I could help you with?

Just get her out of here.

weren't you off at midnight?

Yes. I just had
some things to finish.

561
00:41:56,544 --> 00:41:59,757
This patient's been
a difficult case.

563
00:42:09,259 --> 00:42:11,926
Yeah, everything's fine.

[Door chimes]

566
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,555
My biggest concern
would be an abscess

567
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:48,791
Or some kind of resistant
bacterial strain.

568
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:50,425
An abscess is doubtful.

569
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,461
Keep your eye
on the resistance culture.

570
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:54,413
We are seeing
more resistance in these.

571
00:43:54,448 --> 00:43:56,641
I was gonna start her
on Ceftazidime.

572
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:58,835
Well, if she doesn't
start stabilizing,

573
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,135
We're gonna have to move her
to icu.

574
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,304
And keep an eye out for sepsis.

How often are you
checking signs?

576
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,372
- Two hours.
- Okay. Good.

the resistance culture says.

What does that mean?

Your infection
might be a little tougher

581

We're starting you
on another antibiotic,

584
00:44:22,791 --> 00:44:24,460
And we need to make sure that
you're not developing sepsis.

585
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,193
What's that?

586
00:44:26,228 --> 00:44:28,063
An intravascular infection.

587
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:29,763
An intra what?

588
00:44:29,798 --> 00:44:32,969
It's in the bloodstream.

589
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:34,170
Is that serious?

590
00:44:34,205 --> 00:44:36,108
It can be.

591
00:44:39,108 --> 00:44:43,481
I didn't think doctors
had to do that.

592
00:44:45,481 --> 00:44:48,115
I don't mind.

593

If I have an operation,
will you operate on me?

594
00:44:52,422 --> 00:44:54,490
I don't operate.

595
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,230
Hmm.

596
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,763
I don't want to
cut into people.

597
00:45:02,798 --> 00:45:06,168
That's why I went
into internal medicine.

598

If I do my job right,

599

for two minutes.

611
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:53,082
It's not a good idea.

612
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:54,918
Just leave her alone
for a little while.

613
00:45:54,953 --> 00:45:56,824

614
00:46:01,824 --> 00:46:04,360

work together on it,

622

I didn't tell you...

624

about before I came back
to the hospital.

I don't know if it's what could
have made me get sick again.

No, of course not.

gonna die, I wanted to, like,

anything quite like this.

so resistant before.

regular cultures

652

maybe some nosocomial thing?

come up in cultures.

would like to see you

718
01:00:43,339 --> 01:00:45,481
In conference room three.

719
01:00:53,481 --> 01:00:56,050
You wanted to see me?

720
01:00:56,085 --> 01:00:58,592
Yes, martin.

722
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:12,739
This the first time
this has happened?

723
01:01:17,739 --> 01:01:21,041
Yes.

724
01:01:21,076 --> 01:01:25,047
I never meant it to happen,
it just...

725
01:01:25,082 --> 01:01:29,858
got out of control.

726
01:01:36,858 --> 01:01:39,026
Well,
this is Dr. Sayler.

727
01:01:39,061 --> 01:01:41,829
She's a psychiatrist
on staff here.

728
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,198
Hello, martin.

729
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:47,469
It's always hard
to lose a patient,

730
01:01:47,504 --> 01:01:50,037
Especially the first time.

731
01:01:50,072 --> 01:01:51,171
You always question yourself.

732
01:01:51,206 --> 01:01:55,309
You wonder if you made mistakes,
if you missed something,

733
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:57,980
Could you have been quicker?

734
01:01:58,015 --> 01:02:00,146
These things happen.

735
01:02:00,181 --> 01:02:03,134
Accepting that
is part of being a doctor.

736
01:02:03,169 --> 01:02:06,088
If there's anything
you want to express,

737
01:02:06,123 --> 01:02:08,065
Please don't hold back.

738
01:02:17,065 --> 01:02:19,936
Can I ask you a question?

739
01:02:21,936 --> 01:02:23,169
Okay.

740
01:02:23,204 --> 01:02:26,043
Did you cry yesterday?

741
01:02:29,043 --> 01:02:32,215
I did, yes.

742
01:02:34,215 --> 01:02:37,151
Good.

743
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:39,023
That's good.

744
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:42,941
Oh, Mr. Nixon,
I am so sorr...

745
01:02:42,976 --> 01:02:44,860
Just want to talk
to the doctor.

746
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:46,894
You killed my little girl.

747
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:49,329
Okay, Mr. Nixon,
I am truly sorry for your loss,

748
01:02:49,364 --> 01:02:51,967
But you cannot come onto my ward
and start accusing my doctors.

749
01:02:52,002 --> 01:02:53,769
That bastard killed
my daughter.

750
01:02:53,804 --> 01:02:55,220
- Okay.
- What is the problem, sir?

751
01:02:55,255 --> 01:02:56,602
She was fine,
then she came in here,

752
01:02:56,637 --> 01:02:58,890
And you killed her.
- Martin, let me handle this.

753
01:02:58,925 --> 01:03:01,143
Sir, these infections can be
very difficult to treat.

754
01:03:01,178 --> 01:03:03,109
It was a rare,
resistant strain.

755
01:03:03,144 --> 01:03:05,496
Now, if she didn't take
every one of her pills,

756
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:07,849
That could strengthen
the infection... We don't know.

757
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:09,115
She tool her pills.
She told me.

758
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:11,084
Don't blame dr. Blake, sir.
I supervised him

759
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:15,157
Through the entire case.
He was exemplary in every way.

760
01:03:15,192 --> 01:03:16,025
We did everything we could,

761
01:03:17,025 --> 01:03:19,599
Everything, all of us.

762
01:03:24,599 --> 01:03:27,904
Sir, can you come with me,
please?

763
01:03:28,904 --> 01:03:32,509
Sir.
- Get your hands off me.

You shouldn't have to
deal with that.

01:03:53,494 --> 01:03:56,164
It's a tough one.

771
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:58,064
Yeah.

772
01:03:58,099 --> 01:03:59,533
Don't worry about it.
Waylans told me

773
01:03:59,568 --> 01:04:03,063
You're not really a doctor
until you've lost a patient.

Right, Mr. Granger,
you crazy, old fucker?

781
01:05:42,637 --> 01:05:46,173
So it must be a relief
to get onto that new rotation.

782
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:48,342
Sounds like that last one
was pretty rough.

These things happen,
unfortunately.

784
01:05:49,744 --> 01:05:53,081
It's part of being a doctor,
dealing with loss.

785
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:57,452
Oh.
So I guess you're a doctor now.

786
01:05:57,487 --> 01:05:59,119
I suppose so.

would be the best part

The ladies love a doctor.

790

791

What is it?

798
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:31,152
Well, doctor, I just wanted to
ask you an ethical question

799
01:06:31,187 --> 01:06:34,339
About the relations
between staff and patients.

800
01:06:34,374 --> 01:06:37,492
That woman in the supply room?
Forget about it.

801
01:06:37,527 --> 01:06:39,026
No, no, no, no,
that's not my question.

802
01:06:39,061 --> 01:06:41,463
See, I'm more interested
in a situation like this.

803
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:43,132
All right, say a guy like me,

804
01:06:43,167 --> 01:06:44,731
You know, who likes to party,

805

like an orderly,

One day, he's takin' this gurney
to change it out...

807
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:52,007
Oh, and the previous tenant
was this girl,

808

It was a sweet girl,
she just passed away.

takin' out the mattress,

810

811
01:06:58,179 --> 01:06:59,780

under there,

812

Seems they had kind of a little,
special relationship goin' on.

815
01:07:12,393 --> 01:07:16,331
Now my question is this,
do you think it's wrong,

816
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:18,597
Ethically, for this orderly

817
01:07:18,632 --> 01:07:23,115

It's very erratic behavior.

it occurred to them

929
01:16:58,113 --> 01:16:59,745
That he might be a drug abuser.

930
01:16:59,780 --> 01:17:01,351

a mandatory test scheduled.

from the hospital yesterday.

if we had any more questions...

963
01:18:38,564 --> 01:18:40,814
I'm sorry
to just drop by like this.

964
01:18:40,849 --> 01:18:44,417
Right.
Fine, come in.

965
01:18:44,452 --> 01:18:46,369
[Door closes]

966
01:19:02,369 --> 01:19:04,137
Can I get you anything?

967
01:19:04,172 --> 01:19:06,806
No, thanks.

968
01:19:06,841 --> 01:19:10,177
So it seems the, uh,
the pills Mr. Vega took

969
01:19:10,212 --> 01:19:13,046
Were spiked
with potassium cyanide.

970
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:16,815
You know about that?
- No.

971
01:19:16,850 --> 01:19:21,020
Well, yeah, I mean,
I know what it is.

972
01:19:21,055 --> 01:19:24,324
Some people suspect that he,
uh, he abused drugs.

973
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:26,860
Looks like
maybe he got a bad batch.

974
01:19:26,895 --> 01:19:29,097
That's a shame.

975
01:19:31,097 --> 01:19:33,065
I mean,
I didn't know him that well.

976
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:37,204
That's why I'm not as upset as
I would be if I knew him better.

977
01:19:37,239 --> 01:19:41,073
I knew him to say hello to.

978
01:19:41,108 --> 01:19:42,542
Did you ever see him
taking drugs?

979
01:19:42,577 --> 01:19:44,177
No.

980
01:19:44,212 --> 01:19:47,586
I hardly knew him, like I said.

981
01:19:51,586 --> 01:19:53,159
[Paper rustling]

Just slightly.
Not well, kind of.

987
01:20:23,951 --> 01:20:25,987
I mean, he was...
not my kind of person.

988
01:20:26,022 --> 01:20:28,023
Do you know
where he got the drugs?

989
01:20:29,023 --> 01:20:31,192
Could he have gotten them
from the hospital, stolen them?

990
01:20:31,227 --> 01:20:32,643
No, they're
carefully monitored,

991
01:20:32,678 --> 01:20:34,060
So I don't know
how an orderly could.

992
01:20:34,095 --> 01:20:36,099
Only a doctor can prescribe.

993
01:20:38,099 --> 01:20:42,069
Could a doctor have
gotten them for him?

994
01:20:42,104 --> 01:20:45,106
Theoretically...[ahem]
a doctor could...

995
01:20:45,141 --> 01:20:47,642
fake a prescription,
or skim from a patient,

996
01:20:47,677 --> 01:20:50,144
But that wouldn't be ethical,
so they don't.

997
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:53,185
So a doctor
could have gotten these.

998
01:20:59,185 --> 01:21:01,153
No.

999
01:21:01,188 --> 01:21:04,425
Did any doctors have any kind
of a relationship with Mr. Vega?

1000
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:06,458
What? No, I...
I don't know.

1001
01:21:06,493 --> 01:21:08,095
I mean, like I said,
I didn't care for him,

1002
01:21:08,130 --> 01:21:09,261
So I didn't hang around him.

1003
01:21:09,296 --> 01:21:13,134
Were there any other doctors
who may have disliked him,

1004
01:21:13,169 --> 01:21:18,204
Who could've tainted the pills
with the, uh, the...

1005
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:21,246
Potassium cyanide.

die like that.

1016

I'm reacting differently now

1021

Than with james' passing away,
but he wasn't much of a person.

1022
01:22:22,071 --> 01:22:24,072
I mean, he'd make
lewd comments at women patients.

1023
01:22:24,107 --> 01:22:26,073
I think he may have even
fooled around with them,

1024
01:22:26,108 --> 01:22:27,680
Which, as a doctor, you can't.
