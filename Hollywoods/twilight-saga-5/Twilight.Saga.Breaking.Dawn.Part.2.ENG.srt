He's been calling twice a day.

191
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:20,761
He's in pretty rough shape.

192
00:19:23,042 --> 00:19:25,567
CARLISLE: Eventually, we'll have to tell him
you didn't make it.

193
00:19:27,146 --> 00:19:28,738
He needs to mourn, Bella.

194
00:19:32,985 --> 00:19:34,850
Okay. We'll do it tomorrow.

195
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,087
I'm gonna miss this place.

196
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,720
We'll come back. We always do.

197
00:19:44,797 --> 00:19:45,764
Wait.

198
00:19:47,266 --> 00:19:49,097
Nobody said anything about leaving.

199
00:19:49,768 --> 00:19:52,896
Once people believe Bella's dead,
we can't risk anyone seeing her.

200
00:19:53,939 --> 00:19:56,635
So you just disappear?

201
00:19:56,809 --> 00:19:58,401
Jacob, we don't have another choice.

202
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,717
Hey.

203
00:20:39,518 --> 00:20:40,576
You heard anything?

204
00:20:43,455 --> 00:20:44,717
Charlie,

205
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,325
Bella is...

206
00:20:49,795 --> 00:20:50,762
Uh...

207
00:20:53,532 --> 00:20:54,726
No, she's not.

208
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,391
No, no, no, I mean, she's fine.

209
00:20:56,502 --> 00:20:57,764
She's back home and

210
00:20:58,671 --> 00:21:00,468
she's feeling better.

211
00:21:03,042 --> 00:21:05,237
Why didn't you say so? That's great.

212
00:21:06,879 --> 00:21:08,244
Wait.

213
00:21:08,347 --> 00:21:10,474
There's something you need to see first.

214
00:21:11,016 --> 00:21:12,176
I need to see Bella.

215
00:21:12,451 --> 00:21:13,782
Look,

216
00:21:14,687 --> 00:21:17,850
in order for Bella to get better, she had to

217
00:21:20,893 --> 00:21:22,258
change.

218
00:21:23,729 --> 00:21:25,094
What do you mean, "change"?

219
00:21:31,303 --> 00:21:32,998
Here goes nothing.

220
00:21:33,672 --> 00:21:35,435

221
00:21:35,741 --> 00:21:37,834

222

JACOB: Now, this may seem strange.

224
00:21:47,152 --> 00:21:49,313
Really strange. But

225
00:21:50,889 --> 00:21:52,857

230

You were leaving.

231
00:22:13,012 --> 00:22:14,445
What did you expect me to do?

232
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,480
You don't realize
the danger you've put him in.

233
00:22:16,649 --> 00:22:18,947
The Volturi will kill anyone
who knows about us.

234
00:22:19,084 --> 00:22:21,143
No, I didn't tell him about you. Just me.

235
00:22:21,253 --> 00:22:22,948
I only said you were different.

236
00:22:23,088 --> 00:22:25,215
And that we have a niece who we adopted.

237
00:22:25,391 --> 00:22:27,791
I mean, seriously, Jake,
he's not just gonna let that go.

238
00:22:27,893 --> 00:22:30,327
Did you consider
the physical pain he'll put Bella through?

239
00:22:30,496 --> 00:22:33,556
Lt'll be like sticking
a white hot branding iron down her throat.

240
00:22:33,699 --> 00:22:35,667
And that's assuming
she can control her thirst.

241

JACOB: Look, Charlie's been in hell.

242
00:22:37,736 --> 00:22:40,034
And I know you'll be
much happier with him in your life.

243
00:22:40,205 --> 00:22:42,673
Jacob, don't try and pretend you're doing this
for anyone but yourself.

244
00:22:44,777 --> 00:22:46,005
Sorry you feel that way

245
00:22:46,612 --> 00:22:48,546
because he'll be here in 10 minutes.

246
00:22:48,714 --> 00:22:49,703

247
00:22:49,882 --> 00:22:51,713
ALICE: These will irritate your eyes at first.

248
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:55,816
The main thing is not to move too fast.

249
00:22:56,188 --> 00:22:58,918
Try taking a seat. Crossing your legs.

250
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:10,161
Maybe a tad slower. Hmm.

251
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:11,702
And blink at least three times a minute.

252
00:23:15,407 --> 00:23:16,374
Good.

253

For a cartoon character.

254
00:23:19,745 --> 00:23:21,804
Hold your breath. It will help with the thirst.

255
00:23:23,048 --> 00:23:26,017
Just don't forget to move your shoulders
so it looks like you're breathing.

Hi, Dad.

266
00:24:53,305 --> 00:24:54,465
Are you okay?

267
00:24:56,074 --> 00:24:57,302
Never better.

268
00:24:58,844 --> 00:24:59,936

273
00:25:38,417 --> 00:25:40,180
This was necessary.

274

What does that mean?

275
00:25:43,355 --> 00:25:44,754
I really think it would be better...

276

I wanna know what happened to you.

277
00:25:46,758 --> 00:25:47,884
I can't tell you.

278
00:25:49,361 --> 00:25:50,828
I think I deserve an explanation.

279
00:25:50,963 --> 00:25:51,930
You do.

that for whatever reason,

284

I'm all right.

285

287

Why would she and Jasper leave

I won't stand against the Volturi.

It's why I couldn't read your mind,
even before.

01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:36,142
Because only my mind
would be safe from Aro.

732
01:00:43,954 --> 01:00:46,081
JACOB: I'm surprised
you took a break from Jedi training.

733
01:00:47,023 --> 01:00:49,958
If I don't take Renesmee to my dad,
he'll come to us.

734
01:00:51,328 --> 01:00:53,626
27 vampires, one human.

735
01:00:54,497 --> 01:00:55,691
Not so great.

736
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,600
I know that's what you told Edward.

737
01:01:02,372 --> 01:01:04,499
- (EXHALES)
- Whatever.

738
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:08,673
I'm just glad to get away from
all those reeking bloodsuckers.

739
01:01:10,313 --> 01:01:11,280
(SCOFFS)

740
01:01:11,815 --> 01:01:12,782
I'm sorry.

741
01:01:13,383 --> 01:01:14,475
I know.

742
01:01:14,884 --> 01:01:16,476
They're the good guys.

743
01:01:18,254 --> 01:01:19,221
But come on,

744
01:01:19,589 --> 01:01:21,648
Dracula One and Two are

745
01:01:25,095 --> 01:01:26,687
- creepy.
- (BOTH LAUGHING)

746
01:01:40,076 --> 01:01:41,634
CHARLIE: There she is. Come here.

747
01:01:41,945 --> 01:01:43,105
Oh!

748
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:45,673
Wow! Look at you.

749
01:01:46,049 --> 01:01:47,209
You've grown half a foot!

750
01:01:48,051 --> 01:01:49,018
Seriously.

751
01:01:49,753 --> 01:01:50,913
Like 6 inches.

752
01:01:52,288 --> 01:01:53,983
Come on inside. Lunch is on the table.

753
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:55,421
We got a tree to decorate, huh?

754
01:01:55,692 --> 01:01:58,422
I've actually got a few errands to run, guys.

755
01:01:58,528 --> 01:01:59,825
I'll be back soon, okay?

756
01:02:02,032 --> 01:02:03,829
- CHARLIE: Come on. Let's go.
- (RENESMEE LAUGHS)

757
01:02:05,135 --> 01:02:06,102
(ENGINE STARTS)

758
01:02:11,674 --> 01:02:13,733
BELLA: Alice's note
gave me a new sense of hope.

759
01:02:14,744 --> 01:02:16,735
Maybe she had a plan for us after all.

760
01:02:17,947 --> 01:02:19,847
And maybe J. Jenks was the key.

761
01:02:42,806 --> 01:02:45,036
BELLA: I'm meeting Mr. Jenks.
HOST: Right this way.

762
01:02:48,278 --> 01:02:50,246
- JENKS: Mrs. Cullen.
- Hi.

763
01:02:50,713 --> 01:02:52,180
I'm so happy you called.

764
01:03:05,728 --> 01:03:08,219
I always meet my private clients here.

765
01:03:08,331 --> 01:03:10,356
It's more comfortable than the office.

766
01:03:11,101 --> 01:03:12,500
And it's more public.

767
01:03:13,369 --> 01:03:14,734
Ah. (CHUCKLES)

768
01:03:14,871 --> 01:03:16,532
What type of work do you do, J.?

769
01:03:16,906 --> 01:03:18,430
Oh, you know, this and that.

770
01:03:19,309 --> 01:03:21,937
It's always different,
which keeps it interesting.

771
01:03:24,247 --> 01:03:25,874
Have you known Alice and Jasper long?

772
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:30,415
I've been working with them
for more than 20 years.

773
01:03:30,587 --> 01:03:34,421
And my late partner
knew Jasper 15 years before that.

774
01:03:34,557 --> 01:03:35,717
He is, uh,

775
01:03:37,393 --> 01:03:39,418
unusually well-preserved.

776
01:03:41,464 --> 01:03:42,795
Yes, he is.

777
01:03:46,302 --> 01:03:50,033
I trust that Mr. Jasper
is enjoying his vacation.

778
01:03:51,574 --> 01:03:53,735
He didn't tell you where he was going, did he?

779
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:56,936
No, no, no,
he just mentioned that he was leaving

780
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:59,071
when he came by to place his order.

781
01:04:01,251 --> 01:04:03,116
I assume that his order is ready?

782
01:04:03,286 --> 01:04:04,446
Of course.

783
01:04:05,288 --> 01:04:07,256
I've never been late with a delivery.

784
01:04:26,409 --> 01:04:27,933
There a problem?

785
01:04:30,446 --> 01:04:31,413
No.

786
01:04:34,417 --> 01:04:36,647
My husband and I thought
that we'd all be traveling together.

787
01:04:36,819 --> 01:04:38,616
Jasper said only two were traveling.

788
01:04:38,855 --> 01:04:40,322
His instructions were very clear.

789
01:04:40,623 --> 01:04:41,783
It's my mistake.

790
01:04:44,761 --> 01:04:46,592
Apparently, that's not going to happen.

791
01:05:07,984 --> 01:05:09,952
BELLA: Alice's vision was clear.

792
01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:15,790
Renesmee would have a future.

793
01:05:17,727 --> 01:05:19,627
But Edward and I wouldn't be a part of it.

794
01:05:26,169 --> 01:05:27,466
How ya doin'?

795
01:05:32,675 --> 01:05:33,972
(INAUDIBLE)

796
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:48,589
BELLA: "My dearest Renesmee,

797
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:51,224
"I thought we would have forever together.

798
01:05:52,228 --> 01:05:54,196
"But forever isn't as long as I'd hoped.

799
01:05:55,198 --> 01:05:57,223
"I know now why Alice left me clues.

800
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:59,162
"It was to keep you safe.

801
01:06:00,770 --> 01:06:03,170
"Everything you and Jacob will need
is in this pack.

802
01:06:05,241 --> 01:06:06,503
"Jacob will protect you.

803
01:06:07,277 --> 01:06:09,177
"And he'll help you learn
about the Ticuna legends."

804
01:06:13,283 --> 01:06:14,841
It's a romantic notion, isn't it?

805
01:06:15,652 --> 01:06:18,519
That a righteous few can defy a great evil.

806
01:06:19,756 --> 01:06:23,351
I must admit, you even had me believing.

807
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:25,219
For a moment.

808
01:06:26,562 --> 01:06:27,529
(CHUCKLES)

809
01:06:28,097 --> 01:06:30,463
Well, good luck. You're gonna need it.

810
01:06:35,171 --> 01:06:36,138
Cheers.

811
01:06:46,149 --> 01:06:47,411
The snow is sticking.

812
01:06:48,351 --> 01:06:49,477
Hey, we still have today.

813
01:06:57,126 --> 01:06:59,424
I'm so glad Charlie found somebody
to take care of him.

814
01:07:00,263 --> 01:07:01,662
Bella, no one's giving up here.

815
01:07:04,267 --> 01:07:06,258
All right! Present time! Let's go!

816
01:07:06,969 --> 01:07:08,300
Seth, Leah, stop eating.

817
01:07:10,173 --> 01:07:11,606
Jake, you start. Get it going.

818
01:07:12,508 --> 01:07:14,669
SETH: What did you get me?
LEAH: I'm not giving you anything.

819
01:07:15,678 --> 01:07:16,804
SETH: Hey! No, come on,
what did you get me?

820
01:07:16,946 --> 01:07:18,379
BELLA: Well, Dad,
we didn't have time to wrap yours,

821
01:07:18,481 --> 01:07:19,607
but here it is.

822
01:07:25,355 --> 01:07:27,721
It's a 5-day fishing trip to Fraser River.

823
01:07:28,057 --> 01:07:29,149
It's for you and Sue.

824
01:07:29,692 --> 01:07:30,954
You leave tomorrow.

825
01:07:31,327 --> 01:07:33,727
Wow, that's really nice. Thank you.

826
01:07:34,697 --> 01:07:35,891
Tomorrow? I can't leave tomorrow.

827
01:07:36,265 --> 01:07:37,960
I made arrangements for you at work.

828
01:07:39,502 --> 01:07:40,560
Sneaky.

829
01:07:42,238 --> 01:07:43,705
And extravagant.

830
01:07:44,607 --> 01:07:46,302
And non-refundable, I'm afraid.

831
01:07:48,244 --> 01:07:49,643
You two trying to get rid of me?

832
01:07:52,281 --> 01:07:54,340
Because it's working! (CHUCKLES)

833
01:07:55,618 --> 01:07:57,882
Fraser River.
That means we'll be chasing Cutthroat.

834
01:07:58,688 --> 01:08:00,485
SUE: We might even hook
a Rainbow or some Bulls.

835
01:08:01,924 --> 01:08:03,084
Woman knows her trout.

836
01:08:04,627 --> 01:08:06,356
Hey, beautiful. Let me see.

837
01:08:08,364 --> 01:08:09,592
Jacob make this for you?

838
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:11,567
Wanna put it on?

839
01:08:16,739 --> 01:08:17,899
It's so pretty.

840
01:08:18,574 --> 01:08:19,871
It is really pretty.

841
01:08:40,930 --> 01:08:42,522
That's what I'm talkin' about.

842
01:08:44,801 --> 01:08:46,598
A little pre-battle bonfire.

843
01:08:49,138 --> 01:08:50,969
Telling war stories.

844
01:08:54,410 --> 01:08:56,640
Or just standing there like frickin' statues.

845
01:08:59,248 --> 01:09:02,149
Name any American battle. I was there.

846
01:09:04,921 --> 01:09:06,047
Little Bighorn.

847
01:09:07,857 --> 01:09:10,325
I came this close to biting Custer.

848
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:12,223
But the Indians got him first.

849
01:09:13,963 --> 01:09:16,431
Try Oleg's assault on Constantinople.

850
01:09:17,166 --> 01:09:18,963
He didn't win that one on his own.

851
01:09:19,101 --> 01:09:20,363
LIAM: If you're talking battles,

852
01:09:20,470 --> 01:09:21,630
you're talking the Eleven Years' War.

853
01:09:22,138 --> 01:09:24,629
No one does rebellion like the Irish.

854
01:09:24,807 --> 01:09:26,502
You lost the Eleven Years' War.

855
01:09:26,642 --> 01:09:29,304
Aye. But it was one hell of a rebellion.

856
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:32,880
VLADIMIR: When we ruled,
everything came to us.

857
01:09:33,316 --> 01:09:34,340
Prey,

858
01:09:34,584 --> 01:09:35,608
diplomats,

859
01:09:36,185 --> 01:09:37,277
favor seekers.

860
01:09:38,221 --> 01:09:39,882
Such was our power.

861
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:44,151
But we never put on white hats
and called ourselves saints.

862
01:09:44,327 --> 01:09:47,888
We were honest about what we were.

863
01:09:48,197 --> 01:09:51,223
VLADIMIR: We sat still for a very long time.

864
01:09:52,502 --> 01:09:55,232
We didn't notice we were beginning to petrify.

865
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,534
Perhaps the Volturi did us a favor when they

866
01:10:01,444 --> 01:10:03,207
burned our castles.

867
01:10:03,346 --> 01:10:06,474
We've been waiting 1,500 years

868
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:08,740
to return that favor.

869
01:10:11,254 --> 01:10:14,485
We have been ready to do battle for ages.

870
01:10:16,359 --> 01:10:17,883
EDWARD: I can't help thinking,

871
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:19,550
all these people
are putting themselves in danger

872
01:10:19,695 --> 01:10:21,253
because I fell in love with a human.

873
01:10:21,397 --> 01:10:22,728
CARLISLE: You found your mate.

874
01:10:22,899 --> 01:10:24,230
You deserve to be happy.

875
01:10:25,434 --> 01:10:26,867
But at what cost?

876
01:10:26,969 --> 01:10:28,698
Everyone here has something to fight for.

877
01:10:29,071 --> 01:10:30,197
I certainly do.

878
01:10:42,051 --> 01:10:43,450
Carlisle, I've never thanked you.

879
01:10:46,589 --> 01:10:48,250
For this extraordinary life.

880
01:11:06,742 --> 01:11:08,573
This means "More than my own life."

881
01:11:08,678 --> 01:11:10,043
That's how much I love you.

882
01:11:11,614 --> 01:11:13,707
Tomorrow I'm gonna need you
to stay with Jacob.

883
01:11:15,585 --> 01:11:16,813
No matter what.

884
01:11:18,154 --> 01:11:19,712
Even if I tell him that...

885
01:11:21,958 --> 01:11:23,482
That he has to take you somewhere.

886
01:11:26,429 --> 01:11:27,726
Hey.

887
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:28,956
Baby, it's all right.

888
01:11:30,499 --> 01:11:31,898
You're gonna be safe.

889
01:11:35,705 --> 01:11:36,797
Always.

890
01:12:22,518 --> 01:12:24,179
If we live through this,

891
01:12:25,354 --> 01:12:27,481
I'll follow you anywhere, woman.

892
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:32,357
Now you tell me.

893
01:12:48,144 --> 01:12:51,079
The Redcoats are coming!
The Redcoats are coming!

894
01:13:28,484 --> 01:13:29,883
Aro's looking for Alice.

895
01:13:43,232 --> 01:13:44,392
(GASPS)

896
01:13:46,068 --> 01:13:48,059
(WOLF HOWLING)

897
01:13:54,643 --> 01:13:56,577
(GROWLING)

898
01:14:12,928 --> 01:14:14,156
(GROWLS)

899
01:14:27,476 --> 01:14:28,738
CARLISLE: Aro,

900
01:14:28,844 --> 01:14:30,971
let us discuss things as we used to.

901
01:14:31,147 --> 01:14:32,444
In a civilized manner.

902
01:14:32,848 --> 01:14:34,577
Fair words, Carlisle.

903
01:14:35,718 --> 01:14:37,083
But a little out of place,

904
01:14:37,186 --> 01:14:40,019
given the battalion
you've assembled against us.

905
01:14:40,523 --> 01:14:43,117
I can promise you, that was never my intent.

906
01:14:43,793 --> 01:14:45,488
No laws have been broken.

907
01:14:45,995 --> 01:14:47,121
We see the child.

908
01:14:47,663 --> 01:14:49,893
Do not treat us as fools.

909
01:14:50,032 --> 01:14:52,000
