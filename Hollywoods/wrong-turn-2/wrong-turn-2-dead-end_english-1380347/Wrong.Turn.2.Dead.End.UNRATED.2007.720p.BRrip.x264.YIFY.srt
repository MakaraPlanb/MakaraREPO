1
00:02:33,137 --> 00:02:36,222
Now in the street
there is violence

2
00:02:36,306 --> 00:02:40,476
And, and a lots of
work to be done

3
00:02:41,186 --> 00:02:44,063
No place to hang out
our washing

4
00:02:44,148 --> 00:02:47,483
And, and I can't blame
all on the sun

5
00:02:49,486 --> 00:02:50,570
Hello?

6
00:02:50,654 --> 00:02:52,780
It's dead out here and
I'm hating you about now.

7
00:02:52,865 --> 00:02:54,240
What kind of agent
are you?

8
00:02:54,324 --> 00:02:55,908
You'll find the road,
Kimberly.

9
00:02:55,993 --> 00:02:58,411
Look, it's 4:00 a. m. in LA.
Can I go back to sleep?

10
00:02:58,495 --> 00:03:00,079
I was up all night
on the red-eye

11
00:03:00,164 --> 00:03:02,081
and it wasn't first class
like you promised.

12
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:05,001
Give me credit for the
car. Nice ride, huh?

13
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:06,502
Yeah, whatever.

14
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:10,715
By the way, these directions
suck. This project sucks.

15
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:12,425
Hey, it's a great
opportunity.

16
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:14,260
It's a reality show pilot!

17
00:03:14,344 --> 00:03:17,263
Hey, you sang your way to the top
seven the last time you were on TV.

18
00:03:17,347 --> 00:03:18,848
Now, you're the star.

19
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,600
You're
Kimberly-fucking-Caldwell.

20
00:03:20,684 --> 00:03:22,393
You're the only celebrity
they've got!

21
00:03:22,478 --> 00:03:25,646
If I'm such a celebrity,
Tommy, get me a movie.

22
00:03:25,731 --> 00:03:28,149
Look, Kimster, your Q
score is going to go way up

23
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:30,526
and you'll have a chance
to win 90 grand.

24
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:31,694
I thought it was 100.

25
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:34,030
Well, I get 10%,
remember?

26
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:38,034
Wait. There's a turn off.

27
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,752
Look, I've got power yoga in, like,
two hours. Did you find it yet?

28
00:03:48,212 --> 00:03:50,046
I don't know. There's
some old paper mill here,

29
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,589
but there's nothing
about it on the map.

30
00:03:51,673 --> 00:03:52,924
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's got to be it.

31
00:03:53,008 --> 00:03:55,176
Look, Kimbo, you can't afford
to make a wrong turn here.

32
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,595
You really don't
have the time.

33
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:13,569
Why am I here?

34
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:15,279
Because this business
is tough. Besides...

35
00:04:15,364 --> 00:04:16,489
Wait, you're breaking up.
Hello?

36
00:04:16,573 --> 00:04:18,991
...of all my clients, you're the
one with the "it" factor here...

37
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:21,577
Hello? Fuck!

38
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:49,230
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

39
00:04:57,447 --> 00:04:59,615
Don't be dead.
Don't be dead.

40
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:23,514
Help!

41
00:05:27,144 --> 00:05:28,269
Shit!

42
00:05:29,146 --> 00:05:30,438
Anybody?

43
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:38,738
Don't worry. I'm going
to get you help. Okay?

44
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,908
No. Please!

45
00:05:41,992 --> 00:05:45,828
Please! No, don't die.
Come on. Breathe! Breathe!

46
00:05:58,634 --> 00:06:00,343
I'm here. I'm here.

47
00:07:27,764 --> 00:07:31,058
It's the end of the
world. Society in chaos.

48
00:07:31,768 --> 00:07:34,270
Governments no longer
in control.

49
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:38,524
The world has been devastated
by a catastrophic disaster

50
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:40,276
but you're still alive.

51
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:46,032
Overnight you've been thrust
back into the Stone Age.

52
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:48,743
Modern conveniences
are a thing of the past.

53
00:07:48,827 --> 00:07:51,162
Would you have the guts
to survive?

54
00:07:51,246 --> 00:07:54,081
I am retired
Marine Colonel Dale Murphy.

55
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,083
Welcome to the apocalypse.

56
00:07:56,168 --> 00:07:57,710
Over the next five days,

57
00:07:57,794 --> 00:08:01,756
these six contestants will
be put to the ultimate test.

58
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:04,884
I'm going to be the ultimate
survivor, because on my last show

59
00:08:04,968 --> 00:08:08,512
I learned, more than
anything, what it takes to win.

60
00:08:08,597 --> 00:08:10,264
So what's
the tattoo?

61
00:08:10,348 --> 00:08:14,310
It's the infinity sign. Because
I want to be remembered forever.

62
00:08:15,353 --> 00:08:17,354
My friends
call me Jonesy

63
00:08:18,148 --> 00:08:20,483
but Fearless
is my middle name.

64
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:26,906
No, that sucked, dude. I
told you to shave that run!

65
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,824
Can we do that again?

66
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:32,828
Hi, I'm Elena.
I'm like a fox.

67
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:36,749
Sexy, sleek and I always
get what I want.

68
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:42,755
Nina. I'm a survivor because I know
there's only one person I can count on,

69
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,048
myself.

70
00:08:45,342 --> 00:08:46,425
I'm Jake.

71
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,885
Three surgeries
on my rotator cuff

72
00:08:47,969 --> 00:08:50,346
destroyed my shot
at a pro football career

73
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,056
but not my drive to win.

74
00:08:54,142 --> 00:08:56,435
Amber. One tour
of duty in Iraq.

75
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,937
They call me
La Conquistadora.

76
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:01,690
Enough said.
Semper Fi!

77
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:06,028
These six contestants have been thrown
together in a devastated wasteland

78
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:09,949
with only the clothes on their
backs and the will to survive.

79
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:14,662
Rain or shine, in five
days, only one will remain.

80
00:09:14,746 --> 00:09:17,123
Welcome to the apocalypse.

81
00:09:27,217 --> 00:09:31,428
Well, what do you think, man? We
spent all last night cutting it.

82
00:09:31,513 --> 00:09:34,265
Brando,
eat your heart out.

83
00:09:34,349 --> 00:09:37,393
You're the real deal, yo.
That's why the network loves you.

84
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:38,853
It rocks, M.

85
00:09:39,229 --> 00:09:42,231
Damn straight. We're
going to series for sure.

86
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,989
Today's a good day to die.
Where's my producer?

87
00:09:50,115 --> 00:09:53,409
It's brilliant, Michael.
Really. Mara? Thank you.

88
00:09:56,413 --> 00:09:58,455
You know, I still don't
see what makes this show

89
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,374
any different from that
other survivor show.

90
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,834
I don't watch television.

91
00:10:01,918 --> 00:10:04,003
It's supposed to take place
at the end of the world, man.

92
00:10:04,087 --> 00:10:05,421
That's what
makes it different.

93
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:08,174
Look, you're not on some summer
resort trying to make alliances,

94
00:10:08,258 --> 00:10:10,885
you're trying to be the last man
standing after the apocalypse.

95
00:10:10,969 --> 00:10:14,138
It's killer, middle-America
family entertainment, mate.

96
00:10:14,222 --> 00:10:15,806
Boo-ya.

97
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:17,975
I'm so there, dude.

98
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:19,185
No.

99
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:21,353
I plan on being
the last woman standing.

100
00:10:21,438 --> 00:10:24,648
Chill, Ramba. The prize
money's going to be mine.

101
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:28,068
You two girls could mud
wrestle for it. Be ratings gold.

102
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,571
You stupid man.

103
00:10:30,655 --> 00:10:32,031
I am tapping that.

104
00:10:32,115 --> 00:10:34,366
Hey, it's the
parrot heads.

105
00:10:34,451 --> 00:10:36,035
Nice shirts, boys.

106
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:37,953
Yeah, make fun
all you want,

107
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:40,831
but while you Hollywood freaks
are out here sleeping on rocks

108
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:44,627
us parrot heads will be in
Margaritaville back at the hotel.

109
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,381
The woods are all wired up, 32
cameras and mikes ready to go.

110
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:51,050
Oh, you the man, Wojo.

111
00:10:51,134 --> 00:10:54,595
Listen, just make sure everything's
copasetic with Neil, okay?

112
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,971
Yeah, see you
in five days.

113
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:58,307
Enjoy the great outdoors,
Tarantino.

114
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,475
Nice.

115
00:11:01,144 --> 00:11:04,563
I could help you spread it on
all those hard-to-reach places.

116
00:11:04,648 --> 00:11:08,150
You know, if I hadn't seen you
eat shit at the X Games last June,

117
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:09,985
maybe you'd
stand a chance.

118
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,987
Hey, I made the
street comp finals.

119
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:13,864
Okay, here's a clue.

120
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:17,284
I only give it up to
winners, not guys who choke.

121
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:21,372
I'll give you something
to choke on.

122
00:11:30,006 --> 00:11:32,091
I wish I had abs
like yours.

123
00:11:32,175 --> 00:11:34,343
I do 200 of these a day.

124
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:39,265
I guess I'll just stick to my
low-carb diet and hope for the best.

125
00:11:39,349 --> 00:11:40,808
Mara, where the hell
is Kimberly?

126
00:11:40,892 --> 00:11:42,226
There's still no answer.

127
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,479
God damn it! I knew that prima
donna was a problem when we cast her.

128
00:11:45,563 --> 00:11:47,690
Yeah, but she's got those
Angelina Jolie lips.

129
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:50,192
You know what I'm
talking about, don't you?

130
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:52,069
It's gonna be
a long five days.

131
00:11:52,153 --> 00:11:55,030
All right. We can't wait any
longer. I gotta shoot, like, now.

132
00:11:55,865 --> 00:11:57,324
You're the producer,
Pop-Tart.

133
00:11:57,409 --> 00:12:00,494
It's why you make the big
bucks. What are we going to do?

134
00:12:00,578 --> 00:12:01,745
Well, we can't recast.

135
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,122
So we're just going to
have to go with five.

136
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:04,290
Whoa, whoa. No. Wrong.

137
00:12:04,374 --> 00:12:05,332
You know the show.

138
00:12:05,417 --> 00:12:07,459
All I have to do is shoot your
character intro and we're good to go.

139
00:12:07,544 --> 00:12:08,669
No, I don't think so.

140
00:12:08,753 --> 00:12:11,046
What other choice
do we have?

141
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,425
Um...

142
00:12:15,385 --> 00:12:16,844
Okay. Yeah.
What the hell?

143
00:12:16,928 --> 00:12:19,471
That's it. Show them
what you're made of.

144
00:12:19,556 --> 00:12:21,557
All right, boys and girls,
listen up.

145
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:23,976
We have a half-mile hike
to the survivalist camp.

146
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,894
Let's go!
It's time to move out!

147
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:28,397
All right. Everybody grab
your gear and let's get going.

148
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,523
This is it.

149
00:12:29,607 --> 00:12:31,025
Hey, Michael.

150
00:12:32,193 --> 00:12:34,903
You know I'm a complete geek
without my BlackBerry and my cell.

151
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:37,406
I mean, there's a good chance
I'll be the first to go.

152
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:41,327
Oh, come on. Just change your
clothes, put on some bug spray.

153
00:12:41,411 --> 00:12:44,455
You'll be great, even
without your CrackBerry.

154
00:12:45,707 --> 00:12:48,250
Okay. I'll do it for you.

155
00:12:48,585 --> 00:12:54,006
Okay, but, Mara, it's
"M" now, not Michael.

156
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,550
Yes. I know.
Okay. Sorry.

157
00:12:56,634 --> 00:12:57,760
Bye.

158
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:13,609
God. Who am I kidding?

159
00:13:15,445 --> 00:13:17,321
Okay,
we're moving out.

160
00:13:17,405 --> 00:13:21,533
You're all alone out here, so let's
close ranks and stick together.

161
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,000
Hey, everyone's leaving.

162
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:34,463
Hello? Hey.
Everyone's leaving.

163
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:35,714
What?

164
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:38,050
We're about to start the
game. It's time to go.

165
00:13:38,134 --> 00:13:39,968
Hi, I'm Jake.
You're Nina, right?

166
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,471
Look, I'm just here
for the money,

167
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,139
not to make friends,
okay?

168
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:46,642
Wow. Okay.
Fair enough.

169
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:50,521
Oh, Nina. Nina.

170
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:54,691
I saw you drop this while you
were getting out of the RV.

171
00:13:54,776 --> 00:13:56,402
Now M said no food.

172
00:13:56,528 --> 00:13:58,987
Oh, well, I'm vegan.

173
00:14:00,156 --> 00:14:01,949
That might be the only
thing I can eat out here.

174
00:14:02,033 --> 00:14:04,159
Well, you can always
go chew on a tree.

175
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:06,495
This is cheating.

176
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,416
Sue me. Give it back.
Ah-ah!

177
00:14:11,042 --> 00:14:14,962
I would have, but since there's
no need to be making friends...

178
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:19,383
Mmm.

179
00:14:21,136 --> 00:14:22,136
That's good.

180
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,559
All right, everybody.
Ready?

181
00:14:28,643 --> 00:14:30,686
And action, Dale!

182
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:34,064
You cannot survive
the apocalypse alone,

183
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:37,609
so you make friendships,
perform tasks together.

184
00:14:37,694 --> 00:14:40,946
You figure out who you
need to ride out the chaos

185
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,573
and who's expendable.

186
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,492
Today we're going to split
into three teams,

187
00:14:45,577 --> 00:14:47,578
go out and search for food.

188
00:14:47,662 --> 00:14:50,998
The number each of you
picked decides your teammate.

189
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:54,751
Number one
all the way, baby.

190
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,046
You and me, baby,
all the way.

191
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:00,632
Who's got a number two?

192
00:15:00,717 --> 00:15:02,968
Well, I did a number two
back at the gas station.

193
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:06,555
Come on, dude.
That was funny.

194
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:12,227
Oh, sweet.

195
00:15:12,729 --> 00:15:15,522
I guess you and me
are a team. Hello?

196
00:15:15,607 --> 00:15:16,732
All right,
boys and girls.

197
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:20,152
It's the end of the world and the
odds are against you from the start.

198
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:23,280
Radiation poisoning
is a reality.

199
00:15:23,364 --> 00:15:25,324
That's why you're all
wearing these.

200
00:15:25,408 --> 00:15:28,994
Every day you will be given
a Radiation Elimination Card

201
00:15:29,287 --> 00:15:31,205
and one of them
is already contaminated.

202
00:15:32,415 --> 00:15:33,790
At the end of the day,

203
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:37,836
the player holding the
simulated radiated card is dead.

204
00:15:37,921 --> 00:15:41,381
Don't worry, it just
means you're disqualified.

205
00:15:41,466 --> 00:15:43,592
But you have a chance
to survive the day

206
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:46,261
by giving your card
to another player

207
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:49,431
and surviving
the Radiation Elimination.

208
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:55,020
It's a test of your personal
will, your endurance and fate.

209
00:15:55,104 --> 00:15:56,813
And in the apocalypse,

210
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,108
your fate can change
like that.

211
00:16:00,443 --> 00:16:03,278
Wild animals,
bacterial infection,

212
00:16:03,613 --> 00:16:06,657
and post-apocalyptic crazies
are all around you

213
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:10,744
waiting to take you down.
They're represented

214
00:16:12,121 --> 00:16:13,747
by these.

215
00:16:13,831 --> 00:16:18,252
We call them Twists of Fate.
They are survival challenges

216
00:16:18,336 --> 00:16:22,297
and dozens of them are scattered
all over the playing area.

217
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:25,551
You trigger the motion
sensor and you hear this...

218
00:16:30,974 --> 00:16:34,851
Instructions on the back
explain your survival challenge.

219
00:16:34,936 --> 00:16:37,187
Accomplish the challenge

220
00:16:37,272 --> 00:16:40,399
and you earn the right
to take your radiated card

221
00:16:40,483 --> 00:16:44,945
and give it to any player you choose
and automatically survive the day.

222
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:51,827
We are going to assemble
back here at 1800 hours

223
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:58,083
and see who will perish in the chaos
and who is one step closer to $100,000.

224
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:00,168
Good luck to all of you.

225
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:03,338
Remember, you have
to work as a team

226
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,757
to survive the game.

227
00:17:05,842 --> 00:17:08,510
But only one of you can
be the Ultimate Survivalist

228
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:10,846
after the apocalypse!

229
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:12,681
Cut!

230
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,099
Nice work, Dale.

231
00:17:14,183 --> 00:17:16,727
All right! I'm ready for
my 15 minutes, Hollywood.

232
00:17:19,022 --> 00:17:20,272
Okay, everybody.

233
00:17:22,233 --> 00:17:25,902
The headsets are transmitting audio
and video back to the edit bay.

234
00:17:25,987 --> 00:17:27,404
So don't take them off.

235
00:17:27,488 --> 00:17:31,033
And also, cell phones, PDAs,
etc., give them to Neil.

236
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:33,577
He's going to put them
in the RV.

237
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:40,584
Have fun. I've got to go
take a wicked piss, mate.

238
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:41,752
Mmm-hmm.

239
00:17:41,836 --> 00:17:45,005
Okay, I'm going to follow Elena
and Jake first, as planned.

240
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:48,300
Just remember, everybody,
let's make it feel real.

241
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:50,135
Okay.

242
00:17:52,096 --> 00:17:53,180
Hey, what's up?

243
00:17:53,264 --> 00:17:57,184
I'm so gonna suck at this.
Why'd I let you talk me into it?

244
00:17:57,894 --> 00:17:59,936
Because I'm irresistible?

245
00:18:01,397 --> 00:18:02,981
You're a jerk, you know.

246
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:04,399
Come on.

247
00:18:06,277 --> 00:18:09,780
Colonel, what happens if we
lose the elimination round?

248
00:18:09,864 --> 00:18:12,491
We go back to the RV
and you drown your sorrows

249
00:18:12,575 --> 00:18:14,826
with me and Jack Daniels
until the game is done.

250
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:18,163
Well, that sounds like fun, but don't
worry, sweetness. I won't let you lose.

251
00:18:18,247 --> 00:18:21,416
And if any of those pig-fucking
hillbillies come around, I got your back.

252
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:22,793
Hey, bonehead!

253
00:18:22,877 --> 00:18:24,336
I grew up two counties
from here.

254
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,338
I never had sex
with a pig in my life!

255
00:18:26,422 --> 00:18:29,174
You're not promoting
stereotypes, are you, son?

256
00:18:29,258 --> 00:18:30,509
Outstanding!

257
00:18:30,593 --> 00:18:33,011
People in these parts might
not take that talk too well.

258
00:18:33,096 --> 00:18:34,304
You might want to
put a lid on it.

259
00:18:34,389 --> 00:18:36,473
Is that all right with you,
funny man?

260
00:18:36,557 --> 00:18:37,808
Yes, sir.

261
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:44,815
That's cool.

262
00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:47,484
You guys got the whole
military bond thing happening.

263
00:18:47,568 --> 00:18:48,610
Semper Fi and shit.

264
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:51,071
Yeah, and we both
hate assholes.

265
00:18:56,661 --> 00:19:01,415
Shit! The techies were supposed to
finish setting these up before they left.

266
00:19:01,499 --> 00:19:03,542
Put your producer hat away
and get your head in the game.

267
00:19:03,626 --> 00:19:06,294
I'll set these up. I've
got time to kill anyway.

268
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:09,297
Thank you. God, I wish
I didn't have to do this.

269
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:11,758
Old Mikey really put you
on the spot, didn't he?

270
00:19:11,843 --> 00:19:16,054
Guess he thinks it'll be entertaining
to send a city girl into the woods.

271
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:18,181
Cruel if you ask me.
But don't worry.

272
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:20,559
There's something in you
he doesn't see that I do.

273
00:19:20,643 --> 00:19:23,895
You may be pretty, but
you're tougher than you think.

274
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,147
You'll be all right.

275
00:19:29,652 --> 00:19:31,987
So, Nina,
which way should we...

276
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:33,989
I guess we go that way.

277
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:43,475
If you eat fish, maybe we should head
towards the river to find some food.

278
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:46,520
I'm vegan. I don't eat or
use any animal products,

279
00:20:46,604 --> 00:20:48,814
including
the swimming kind.

280
00:20:49,106 --> 00:20:50,232
Oh.

281
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,567
Isn't your belt
made of leather?

282
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:55,362
It's pleather.
I'm not a hypocrite.

283
00:20:55,738 --> 00:20:57,948
No, I didn't think
that you were.

284
00:20:58,032 --> 00:21:01,076
Actually, being vegan is why
you got picked to be on the show.

285
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,703
M thought that there wouldn't
be a lot for you to eat out here

286
00:21:03,788 --> 00:21:05,705
and you might have to
resort to gulping down

287
00:21:05,873 --> 00:21:08,166
insect larva or something.

288
00:21:09,043 --> 00:21:12,170
It's the kind of thing America
loves in its reality shows, right?

289
00:21:12,255 --> 00:21:13,797
America's sick.

290
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,423
Yeah.

291
00:21:16,384 --> 00:21:20,178
I hate reality shows.
They're pretty idiotic.

292
00:21:20,763 --> 00:21:22,722
Then why are you
doing this?

293
00:21:22,807 --> 00:21:24,057
Because it's my job.

294
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:27,894
It's M's first project and I'm
just trying to be supportive.

295
00:21:27,979 --> 00:21:29,354
If I was
his girlfriend,

296
00:21:29,438 --> 00:21:31,690
I would've said, "This
sucks. You're on your own. "

297
00:21:31,774 --> 00:21:32,983
Come on.
No, you wouldn't.

298
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:37,112
Yeah, I would. If you haven't
noticed, I can be a bit of a bitch.

299
00:21:38,906 --> 00:21:42,742
Well, if you hate reality shows,
then why are you doing this?

300
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:45,287
Let's just keep going.

301
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:47,205
We've got to
find some food.

302
00:22:33,044 --> 00:22:34,586
Fucking weekend warriors.

303
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:59,903
You better stand down or
someone's going to get hurt.

304
00:23:46,075 --> 00:23:49,786
Broken arrow, that's really
going to help us hunt for food.

305
00:23:54,417 --> 00:23:58,086
Spear. I like it.
It's so long and hard.

306
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,839
I'm just goofing.

307
00:24:00,923 --> 00:24:04,342
Come on. I read your
bio back in the RV.

308
00:24:04,427 --> 00:24:07,846
West Point, 4.0 average.
You're brainy. That's tight.

309
00:24:08,931 --> 00:24:10,515
I bet you're a reader.

310
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:12,517
What's your
favorite book, huh?

311
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:16,104
I'm in The Cat in the Hat
myself.

312
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:19,107
So you did the whole tour of duty
in Iraq thing, too. That's cool.

313
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,567
I'm more of
a pacifist myself,

314
00:24:20,651 --> 00:24:22,569
but, hey, I can get down
with the patriotism.

315
00:24:22,653 --> 00:24:23,945
Woman in uniform
is a turn-on.

316
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,613
Will you shut up?
Oh, she talks.

317
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:31,661
We've been hiking
for three hours,

318
00:24:31,746 --> 00:24:33,997
but we haven't seen or
heard any animals or birds.

319
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:36,875
It's dead quiet
out here.

320
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:39,878
It's freaky, right?
It's like we're all alone.

321
00:24:39,962 --> 00:24:43,423
We could get all nasty and nobody'd see
a thing, except for 30 million people.

322
00:24:43,507 --> 00:24:45,633
Come on, you're into me,
like, a little bit.

323
00:24:47,344 --> 00:24:49,304
You just don't get it,
do you?

324
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:50,889
I'm not into men.

325
00:24:52,141 --> 00:24:55,977
You... You're a lesbian?
How hot is that?

326
00:24:58,939 --> 00:25:03,109
All right, let me just get
focused here, and action.

327
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:07,447
So I'm at the two, I'm at the
one, I jump, I leap, bam...

328
00:25:08,866 --> 00:25:11,034
Shoulder was
never the same.

329
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:15,163
Killed my chances at a
pro career just like that.

330
00:25:16,957 --> 00:25:21,169
It's funny because you never know
when your life's going to change.

331
00:25:22,338 --> 00:25:26,841
Man, I wanted to be in the
NFL so bad. Since I was six.

332
00:25:27,301 --> 00:25:30,637
Oh, honey, I totally understand
where you're coming from.

333
00:25:30,721 --> 00:25:33,014
No, dude, don't.
Don't look.

334
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:34,933
Don't look in the lens.

335
00:25:35,017 --> 00:25:38,144
So then after college
you just bounced around

336
00:25:38,229 --> 00:25:40,396
trying to find yourself?

337
00:25:40,481 --> 00:25:42,774
Yeah, well, this opportunity
came up, you know,

338
00:25:42,858 --> 00:25:44,442
to be on this TV show.

339
00:25:44,527 --> 00:25:46,653
I can't throw a football no
more, but I'm still athletic.

340
00:25:46,737 --> 00:25:47,987
Mmm-hmm.

341
00:25:48,364 --> 00:25:51,950
I figure I'd use the talents
that God gave me, right?

342
00:25:52,034 --> 00:25:54,536
Well, we'll have
to thank God later.

343
00:25:55,204 --> 00:25:56,538
Yeah, right,
thank God later.

344
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:59,874
You know, I think I hear
the river this way. Yeah.

345
00:26:00,709 --> 00:26:01,960
Come on.

346
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,716
God didn't give you
a pair of balls?

347
00:26:12,221 --> 00:26:14,305
How about
we take a break?

348
00:26:14,682 --> 00:26:18,184
We have to find food. If we
prove that we're the best at it,

349
00:26:18,269 --> 00:26:22,564
then it's less likely that anybody
will give us their radiation card.

350
00:26:23,232 --> 00:26:25,567
I haven't seen
anything to eat.

351
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,403
Oh, no.
Holy shit!

352
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:31,156
It's one of those Twists
of Fates. I set it off.

353
00:26:31,907 --> 00:26:33,408
Where is it?

354
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:39,164
"You've been infected by anthrax
from a nearby laboratory explosion.

355
00:26:39,248 --> 00:26:42,500
"An antidote can be found by the
river. You have two minutes. "

356
00:26:42,585 --> 00:26:43,668
God, I would get this!

357
00:26:43,752 --> 00:26:46,462
Yeah, well, good luck. Go!

358
00:26:46,547 --> 00:26:49,340
Hey, come and shoot.
We need your footage.

359
00:27:02,062 --> 00:27:03,688
I think
I see the river.

360
00:27:03,772 --> 00:27:04,981
Where?

361
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:16,326
What do you need now?

362
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,410
That!

363
00:27:17,494 --> 00:27:18,870
One minute remaining.

364
00:27:30,883 --> 00:27:32,884
45 seconds remaining.

365
00:27:44,146 --> 00:27:45,563
30 seconds remaining.

366
00:28:06,835 --> 00:28:08,711
Eight, seven,

367
00:28:08,796 --> 00:28:11,381
six, five,

368
00:28:11,465 --> 00:28:14,467
four, three, two.

369
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,305
Got it!

370
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:22,892
I can't believe I did it!

371
00:28:22,977 --> 00:28:24,269
You kicked ass!

372
00:28:30,859 --> 00:28:32,110
Awesome.

373
00:28:35,114 --> 00:28:38,157
All right, guys, one sec.
Okay. Keep it loose.

374
00:28:39,368 --> 00:28:40,868
You ready?

375
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:42,036
Go.

376
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:45,540
Whew, it is hot out here.

377
00:28:46,542 --> 00:28:49,419
You know what?
I think we can fish later.

378
00:28:51,171 --> 00:28:52,714
We are rolling.

379
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:01,806
I think I need
to cool off.

380
00:29:11,608 --> 00:29:12,900
So,

381
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:16,863
do you want to get wet?

382
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:22,410
What are you doing?

383
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:26,164
M, what the fuck? I am
standing here giving it my all

384
00:29:26,248 --> 00:29:28,666
and this jock is
just standing there.

385
00:29:28,751 --> 00:29:30,168
Cut!

386
00:29:30,252 --> 00:29:32,378
Okay, what's going on, man?

387
00:29:33,589 --> 00:29:36,799
Look, man, I want to create
chemistry between you two, okay?

388
00:29:36,884 --> 00:29:38,426
You guys are, like,
the sex of this thing.

389
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,510
Mmm-hmm.

390
00:29:39,595 --> 00:29:42,430
You said you wanted
a family reality show.

391
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:44,640
Well, sex is America's
dirty little secret.

392
00:29:44,725 --> 00:29:47,769
You can't talk about it at
church, but at home on TV,

393
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:50,355
people want to see hard bodies,
wet and glistening in the sun.

394
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:51,522
Look, if I do that,

395
00:29:51,607 --> 00:29:54,192
I have a mother and six nieces
that would never speak to me again.

396
00:29:54,276 --> 00:29:57,111
Look, man, people want
to be entertained.

397
00:29:57,821 --> 00:30:00,198
Elena and I are just
greasing the wheels a little.

398
00:30:00,282 --> 00:30:01,616
Greasing the wheels?
Yeah.

399
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,243
Well, look, man, I'm here
to play the game, okay?

400
00:30:04,328 --> 00:30:06,496
Now, you can go
grease the wheels.

401
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,539
You can try
catching some fish.

402
00:30:08,624 --> 00:30:11,376
I'll see if I can find
something to eat in the woods.

403
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:15,254
Grease the wheels. You two are
warped. I'll catch you all later.

404
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:20,718
"Catch you all later"! Great. I
wanted Diddy, I've got a boy scout.

405
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:25,681
M, wait.

406
00:30:25,766 --> 00:30:29,268
We don't need Jake. I'm
all the sex that you want.

407
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:33,314
You're hot, but it's not the same thing.

408
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:34,732
Hey! Where you going?

409
00:30:34,817 --> 00:30:37,652
What, you're gonna go
shoot your girlfriend?

410
00:30:38,612 --> 00:30:42,073
No. Actually, I've got to
rethink the story lines.

411
00:30:42,491 --> 00:30:46,035
Hey, listen, I'm doing
this gig for, like, free,

412
00:30:47,621 --> 00:30:51,040
and I want all the screen
time that I can get.

413
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,502
And I know how to
make sure that happens.

414
00:30:56,922 --> 00:30:58,172
Really?

415
00:31:02,052 --> 00:31:03,511
Works for me.

416
00:31:16,525 --> 00:31:17,775
No, you don't get it.

417
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:21,946
I'm like a complete spaz when it comes
to anything even remotely athletic.

418
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,990
I'm sorry I didn't help.

419
00:31:24,658 --> 00:31:27,243
You're just playing
the game. I understand.

420
00:31:27,327 --> 00:31:29,454
I just really
need this money.

421
00:31:29,538 --> 00:31:31,706
Look, I'm not going to
give you my radiation card,

422
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,958
if that's what
you're worried about.

423
00:31:34,042 --> 00:31:37,712
I'm just thrilled that I
actually get to live another day!

424
00:31:48,015 --> 00:31:49,348
Motherfucker.

425
00:32:03,614 --> 00:32:05,781
Look, I know it hurts

426
00:32:05,866 --> 00:32:08,659
but you don't need a piece of
shit like that in your life.

427
00:32:08,744 --> 00:32:09,744
You're better off
without him.

428
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:17,126
I thought he was
"the one," you know?

429
00:32:17,211 --> 00:32:18,294
Yeah.

430
00:32:22,466 --> 00:32:25,301
I've known scumbags
like this all my life.

431
00:32:26,053 --> 00:32:27,845
Six months ago,

432
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:31,057
I caught my fiancé in bed
with my best friend.

433
00:32:31,391 --> 00:32:32,433
Really?

434
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:37,772
To top it off, he used my credit
cards to put me into major debt.

435
00:32:38,565 --> 00:32:41,150
That's why I have
to win this game.

436
00:32:41,235 --> 00:32:44,779
The sooner you realize you
can only depend on yourself,

437
00:32:45,948 --> 00:32:47,949
the better off
you'll be.

438
00:32:50,077 --> 00:32:51,452
Come on.

439
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,289
Take a breath. Let's go
down there and kick his ass.

440
00:32:58,293 --> 00:33:00,461
Is that what you did
to your fiancé?

441
00:33:00,546 --> 00:33:02,713
Put him in the hospital.
Come on.

442
00:33:04,466 --> 00:33:08,094
No. I'll just deal
with it my own way.

443
00:33:08,178 --> 00:33:09,762
It's what he deserves!

444
00:33:11,473 --> 00:33:12,890
It's not me.

445
00:33:13,642 --> 00:33:14,767
Come on.

446
00:33:14,851 --> 00:33:18,646
No! I'm not like you.
I don't want to be.

447
00:33:20,816 --> 00:33:22,650
I'm sorry.
That came out wrong.

448
00:33:23,527 --> 00:33:24,860
It's okay.

449
00:33:34,329 --> 00:33:36,080
Come on. Just tell me one
hot experience that you had.

450
00:33:36,164 --> 00:33:37,206
Oh, God.

451
00:33:37,291 --> 00:33:39,083
No, I can even get you on
Howard Stern if it's good.

452
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:40,835
I've got a buddy who works
in his studio in New York.

453
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:42,128
You're such a moron.

454
00:33:42,212 --> 00:33:44,463
Yeah, but we're on the
same team here, you know?

455
00:33:44,548 --> 00:33:46,215
The same team.

456
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,260
All right. All right. All right.
All right. I'll stop. I'll stop.

457
00:33:49,344 --> 00:33:50,845
I swear.
Cross my heart.

458
00:33:51,388 --> 00:33:52,430
No more sex talk.

459
00:33:52,514 --> 00:33:55,099
From now on, you'll be the
uptight lesbian sister I never had.

460
00:33:55,183 --> 00:33:56,517
Truce?

461
00:34:00,188 --> 00:34:01,606
Oh!

462
00:34:02,482 --> 00:34:04,775
And now that we're family tell
me, who went down on who first?

463
00:34:06,069 --> 00:34:08,279
I'm kidding.
I'm just...

464
00:34:11,033 --> 00:34:12,366
Is that barbecue?

465
00:34:15,537 --> 00:34:17,705
Mission fucking
accomplished.

466
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:20,041
Wait. This is too easy.

467
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:22,126
Maybe this is a trap
to make us lose the game.

468
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,003
What trap? It's a hunter's camp, sister.

469
00:34:24,087 --> 00:34:25,129
What are you doing?

470
00:34:25,213 --> 00:34:27,173
I'm starved, and damn,
that smells awesome.

471
00:34:27,257 --> 00:34:29,800
Well, if this is a real hunter's
camp, we can't just steal his food.

472
00:34:29,885 --> 00:34:30,885
Why the hell not?

473
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:33,638
It's a survival-of-the-fittest kind
of thing, you know. Finders keepers.

474
00:34:33,722 --> 00:34:35,973
You're a lesbian.
Where are your cojones?

475
00:34:36,058 --> 00:34:38,142
Look, if we bring this back
to share with the others,

476
00:34:38,226 --> 00:34:40,561
nobody's going to want us
out of the game, huh?

477
00:34:42,522 --> 00:34:43,981
What, it's hot?

478
00:34:54,242 --> 00:34:55,493
Finally, we're a team.

479
00:34:57,245 --> 00:34:58,579
Don't push your luck.

480
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:04,585
Mmm. Pork. Man, these hillbillies
really know their barbecue.

481
00:36:17,492 --> 00:36:18,659
So what are you
going to do?

482
00:36:18,744 --> 00:36:22,621
Getting out of here. I'll call the
techies to drive me back to Wheeling.

483
00:36:22,706 --> 00:36:24,498
Well, you're headed
the wrong way.

484
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:26,250
RV and cell phones
are back that way.

485
00:36:26,334 --> 00:36:28,377
Yeah, I can't get
a signal from the RV.

486
00:36:28,462 --> 00:36:30,129
I'm just going to
call them from there.

487
00:36:31,131 --> 00:36:32,173
Okay.

488
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:37,887
Besides, I really don't want to
run into Michael at the trailer.

489
00:36:38,346 --> 00:36:40,765
You're kidding.
No, you're crazy. Okay.

490
00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:42,016
Hello?

491
00:36:47,647 --> 00:36:48,814
Hello?

492
00:36:51,777 --> 00:36:54,528
You can't just walk
into somebody's house.

493
00:36:55,113 --> 00:36:59,116
Hello? I need to use
your phone, please.

494
00:37:03,663 --> 00:37:05,748
We shouldn't be here.

495
00:37:05,832 --> 00:37:07,792
Then just wait
for me outside.

496
00:37:07,876 --> 00:37:11,003
I want to make one
phone call and I'm gone.

497
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,507
Hello?

498
00:37:40,075 --> 00:37:41,158
Oh.

499
00:37:43,203 --> 00:37:44,912
All right.
No phone, so...

500
00:37:45,872 --> 00:37:47,832
Oh! Uh...

501
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:49,375
We done yet?

502
00:37:54,214 --> 00:37:55,548
Holy shit!

503
00:37:59,135 --> 00:38:00,970
The whole family's deformed.

504
00:38:02,597 --> 00:38:04,265
God, look at the twins.

505
00:38:10,814 --> 00:38:12,857
It'll be all right.
Don't worry...

506
00:38:12,941 --> 00:38:15,109
Hold on.
Don't drop her.

507
00:38:24,995 --> 00:38:27,454
Baby's coming now. You
stay here with your ma.

508
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:29,164
I'm gonna fetch
some water.

509
00:39:18,173 --> 00:39:19,548
The toolbox!

510
00:39:26,139 --> 00:39:27,348
Go, go!

511
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,729
What do we do now?

512
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:35,481
Help me!

513
00:39:52,374 --> 00:39:54,333
There's light.
There's light.

514
00:41:20,795 --> 00:41:23,130
Help me.

515
00:43:05,233 --> 00:43:06,358
Fuck her.

516
00:43:43,313 --> 00:43:44,438
Hey, you good?

517
00:43:44,522 --> 00:43:45,606
I'm good.

518
00:43:47,525 --> 00:43:50,319
Can we keep this
as our secret?

519
00:43:50,403 --> 00:43:51,695
I wouldn't want to
mess things up with Mara.

520
00:43:51,779 --> 00:43:54,323
You know, I think she's "the one," so...

521
00:43:54,407 --> 00:43:55,741
Whatever.

522
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:58,118
All right. I'm heading
back to the RV. You coming?

523
00:43:59,162 --> 00:44:02,706
No, my job is done. I'm just
going to stay here and tan.

524
00:44:07,003 --> 00:44:08,921
Tell Mara I say hi.

525
00:44:13,343 --> 00:44:14,551
You're the star.

526
00:44:14,636 --> 00:44:15,844
Uh-huh!

527
00:44:38,743 --> 00:44:41,370
M? Is that you?

528
00:44:43,164 --> 00:44:44,957
Don't screw around.
It's not cool.

529
00:44:59,764 --> 00:45:03,517
Oh, shit! Okay,
what's the challenge?

530
00:45:10,149 --> 00:45:11,316
Fuck.

531
00:46:52,627 --> 00:46:53,710
Mara.

532
00:46:54,754 --> 00:46:55,962
Mara!

533
00:48:57,752 --> 00:48:59,377
Hey, Neil! I'm back, yo.

534
00:48:59,462 --> 00:49:01,922
What, are you
dropping a deuce?

535
00:49:02,215 --> 00:49:04,508
Seriously, Neil,
light a match.

536
00:49:05,301 --> 00:49:06,510
Neil!

537
00:49:07,762 --> 00:49:09,679
Guess you're not here.

538
00:49:09,764 --> 00:49:12,224
All right,
let's see what we can see.

539
00:49:16,896 --> 00:49:18,939
Run, no, run.

540
00:49:24,403 --> 00:49:25,487
What?

541
00:49:28,115 --> 00:49:29,449
What the...

542
00:49:30,535 --> 00:49:31,910
Oh, fuck.

543
00:49:33,996 --> 00:49:35,455
Let's see.

544
00:49:35,665 --> 00:49:36,998
This end...

545
00:49:38,167 --> 00:49:40,085
This end, too. All right.

546
00:49:40,169 --> 00:49:42,712
Well, this works. Well,
then, what's the matter?

547
00:49:42,797 --> 00:49:46,424
Neil, I can't figure.
This seems...

548
00:49:46,509 --> 00:49:49,719
Great, you know. You spend
money on film school, just to...

549
00:49:52,139 --> 00:49:53,473
Looks fine.

550
00:49:56,811 --> 00:49:58,478
Two, three, four...

551
00:49:58,563 --> 00:50:02,148
Input. Output. Yeah,
that works. Looks good.

552
00:50:02,525 --> 00:50:03,900
What is that? Nina?

553
00:50:18,332 --> 00:50:21,876
Damn it! Neil, you can't
move! We're hardwired in.

554
00:50:27,008 --> 00:50:28,383
What the...

555
00:51:15,556 --> 00:51:17,223
This is cool.

556
00:51:17,308 --> 00:51:19,309
Going for
another one, huh?

557
00:51:19,393 --> 00:51:20,852
The only white meat.

558
00:51:20,936 --> 00:51:22,812
If this is what Armageddon's
like, bring it on, baby.

559
00:51:22,897 --> 00:51:25,815
Yeah. Maybe next time you
should search for a bib.

560
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,525
I'm so glad
I ran into you guys.

561
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:29,694
Yeah, and don't forget
who got you the nosh, dude.

562
00:51:29,779 --> 00:51:31,571
You win the chance to get
rid of that nuclear card,

563
00:51:31,656 --> 00:51:32,697
send it someplace else.

564
00:51:32,782 --> 00:51:34,240
No worries.

565
00:51:36,494 --> 00:51:38,203
Hey, where's M and Elena?

566
00:51:38,913 --> 00:51:42,415
Back at the river shooting
the unrated version of the DVD.

567
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,167
I'll see you two later.

568
00:51:44,251 --> 00:51:45,752
Oh, dude.

569
00:51:46,253 --> 00:51:47,379
I can't even move.

570
00:51:47,463 --> 00:51:49,381
I'm so stuffed, sex is
going to have to wait.

571
00:51:50,591 --> 00:51:52,133
Shit ghost!

572
00:51:53,052 --> 00:51:54,511
You're nasty.

573
00:51:54,595 --> 00:51:56,137
If you win, what will
you do with the money?

574
00:51:56,222 --> 00:51:59,849
When I win, I'm going to throw the
most outrageous beach party in history.

575
00:51:59,934 --> 00:52:01,643
You're a cliché, dude.

576
00:52:02,812 --> 00:52:03,853
How about you?

577
00:52:03,938 --> 00:52:05,772
Well, when I win,

578
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:07,982
I plan on getting my
degree in sports medicine.

579
00:52:08,442 --> 00:52:10,819
Since my arm won't let me
play football anymore,

580
00:52:10,903 --> 00:52:13,571
I figure I can still help others,
you know, stay in the game.

581
00:52:13,656 --> 00:52:17,742
Can't be a football hero, so you'll
settle for a hero of any kind.

582
00:52:17,952 --> 00:52:20,036
Yeah, something like that.

583
00:52:20,621 --> 00:52:23,081
Nice to know there's
still hope for mankind.

584
00:52:23,165 --> 00:52:26,126
Dude, if you're saying this to
get in her pants, forget about it.

585
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:28,002
She doesn't play
on our team.

586
00:52:28,087 --> 00:52:29,087
Shut up.

587
00:52:29,171 --> 00:52:32,507
How about you? What you
plan on doing with the cash?

588
00:52:33,259 --> 00:52:34,926
I owe my father
a bunch of money.

589
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:38,012
If I win, I am free and
clear of him for good.

590
00:52:38,681 --> 00:52:40,014
Your father?

591
00:52:40,099 --> 00:52:42,392
He doesn't approve
of my lifestyle.

592
00:52:42,476 --> 00:52:44,060
Wants nothing
to do with me.

593
00:52:44,311 --> 00:52:45,353
Hmm.

594
00:52:46,188 --> 00:52:48,398
I guess you can't
choose family.

595
00:52:48,482 --> 00:52:50,817
Man, M is so screwed.

596
00:52:51,652 --> 00:52:55,113
He wanted a show for middle
America, but he hired a lesbo,

597
00:52:55,197 --> 00:52:57,615
a sensitive jock,
a bi-polar vegan,

598
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,576
an extreme fuck-up
and Miss Hollywood.

599
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:01,745
Dude, we're the red state
cast from hell.

600
00:53:04,081 --> 00:53:05,331
Oh, God.

601
00:53:06,709 --> 00:53:08,001
Yo, Nina.

602
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:11,379
You all right, Nina?

603
00:53:11,464 --> 00:53:13,339
Mara... Dead.

604
00:53:13,632 --> 00:53:14,674
What happened to you?

605
00:53:14,759 --> 00:53:15,967
We have to
get out of here!

606
00:53:16,051 --> 00:53:17,177
Now!
What?

607
00:53:17,261 --> 00:53:18,344
They killed her!

608
00:53:18,429 --> 00:53:19,971
Hey, look. Calm down.
They'll find us here!

609
00:53:20,055 --> 00:53:21,431
Whoa, take a deep breath,
okay? Who?

610
00:53:21,515 --> 00:53:23,725
Who will find us here?
What are you talking about?

611
00:53:23,809 --> 00:53:27,937
These hillbilly freaks.
They killed Mara

612
00:53:28,022 --> 00:53:30,940
and they tied her to
the hood of their truck.

613
00:53:31,275 --> 00:53:33,526
We have to get out of here.
Right now!

614
00:53:37,031 --> 00:53:38,531
This is awesome!

615
00:53:38,616 --> 00:53:39,532
What is wrong with you?

616
00:53:39,617 --> 00:53:40,617
I'm not kidding!

617
00:53:40,701 --> 00:53:42,076
Come on.
It's part of the game.

618
00:53:42,161 --> 00:53:44,704
Post-apocalyptic crazies are
roaming through the forest?

619
00:53:44,789 --> 00:53:49,292
It's not a game, okay? These
hillbillies were eating her finger!

620
00:53:49,794 --> 00:53:52,128
Hillbilly cannibals.
M is a genius!

621
00:53:52,713 --> 00:53:53,755
Stop laughing!

622
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:55,673
Yo, you, yo, stop laughing,
man, okay? Hold on.

623
00:53:55,758 --> 00:53:57,759
It's Mara.
She's M's girlfriend.

624
00:53:57,843 --> 00:53:59,761
She was in on it.
I got this.

625
00:53:59,845 --> 00:54:02,555
What you saw was
special effects.

626
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:07,435
What I saw was real.

627
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,604
We need to get
out of here. Now.

628
00:54:10,231 --> 00:54:12,732
Please. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're going.

629
00:54:12,817 --> 00:54:15,318
This is just a test
to see if we bug out.

630
00:54:15,402 --> 00:54:17,403
These kind of shows always
screw with their contestants.

631
00:54:17,488 --> 00:54:19,030
You guys want to go,
go ahead.

632
00:54:19,114 --> 00:54:21,074
I'm staying put
and winning the hundred Gs.

633
00:54:21,242 --> 00:54:22,867
Then they'll kill you, too.

634
00:54:22,952 --> 00:54:24,077
What?

635
00:54:26,789 --> 00:54:28,164
No!

636
00:54:28,249 --> 00:54:29,874
Nina? Nina!

637
00:54:34,255 --> 00:54:35,588
Get the fuck...

638
00:54:35,673 --> 00:54:37,382
That's Kimberly's tattoo.

639
00:54:38,259 --> 00:54:41,261
Holy shit!
That's her leg.

640
00:54:44,598 --> 00:54:45,932
That's it.

641
00:54:46,851 --> 00:54:49,060
Game's over.
Amber, let's go.

642
00:54:49,436 --> 00:54:50,728
Come on.

643
00:54:51,689 --> 00:54:53,106
Jonesy!

644
00:55:02,616 --> 00:55:04,492
They're fucking
cannibals, dude! Shut up.

645
00:55:04,577 --> 00:55:05,702
Where the hell's the RV?

646
00:55:05,786 --> 00:55:06,703
Just over the ridge.

647
00:55:06,787 --> 00:55:07,996
Keep quiet
and keep moving.

648
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,122
I ain't stopping.

649
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:12,417
My foot!

650
00:55:13,502 --> 00:55:14,586
Let me look at it.

651
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:16,921
I'm a shark, man! I gotta keep moving
or I die. You know what I'm saying?

652
00:55:17,006 --> 00:55:18,006
Jonesy, shut the fuck up!

653
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:19,674
Look, you guys
get to the RV, okay?

654
00:55:19,758 --> 00:55:21,217
We'll be
right behind you.

655
00:55:22,887 --> 00:55:24,012
This is going to suck.

656
00:55:25,139 --> 00:55:26,306
Shit!

657
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:30,059
I need to put
pressure on that.

658
00:55:30,144 --> 00:55:32,770
Come on, give me your wristband. No.

659
00:55:32,855 --> 00:55:35,481
Look, you don't have
to hide anymore.

660
00:55:37,735 --> 00:55:39,360
How did you know?

661
00:55:39,695 --> 00:55:41,821
When I found out I'd
never play football again,

662
00:55:41,906 --> 00:55:43,865
I spiraled down
pretty hard.

663
00:55:43,949 --> 00:55:47,577
My therapist told me I should sit
in one of her suicide support groups.

664
00:55:47,661 --> 00:55:49,871
You know, give me
a better perspective.

665
00:55:49,955 --> 00:55:52,916
There was a girl that
used to do the same thing,

666
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,417
only she used
a bandanna.

667
00:55:55,377 --> 00:55:56,753
So how old is the scar?

668
00:55:56,837 --> 00:55:58,087
About six months.

669
00:55:58,172 --> 00:55:59,672
What happened?

670
00:56:00,341 --> 00:56:04,177
I just trusted too many of
the wrong people. All my life.

671
00:56:04,261 --> 00:56:05,762
But I'm past it now.

672
00:56:05,846 --> 00:56:07,347
So it's old news?

673
00:56:08,349 --> 00:56:10,642
Why do you think
I came to win this game?

674
00:56:11,602 --> 00:56:14,187
Guess you'll get your
chance to do just that.

675
00:56:51,183 --> 00:56:54,352
You so much as fart, old
man, and I'll drop you.

676
00:56:56,230 --> 00:56:59,399
Don't kill me, brother.
I'm a good Christian man.

677
00:57:00,943 --> 00:57:02,110
Shit! Are you sure?

678
00:57:02,194 --> 00:57:03,987
Yeah, this was the place.

679
00:57:04,071 --> 00:57:06,823
Here are the tire tracks, the
empty equipment cases, the garbage.

680
00:57:06,907 --> 00:57:08,950
This is so F'd in the A.

681
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:12,328
The fucking RV is gone!

682
00:57:12,413 --> 00:57:13,413
Let's just keep going.

683
00:57:13,497 --> 00:57:14,747
But we're dead meat.
Where to?

684
00:57:14,832 --> 00:57:16,165
The nearest town
is 50 miles away.

685
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:17,959
We're all going to end up
hillbilly barbecue.

686
00:57:18,043 --> 00:57:20,003
I'm not going to tell
you again. Keep quiet!

687
00:57:20,087 --> 00:57:21,129
Then come on.

688
00:57:21,213 --> 00:57:23,172
No, no. There's that old paper
mill out by the main road.

689
00:57:23,257 --> 00:57:24,549
Right. You know,
it's abandoned.

690
00:57:24,633 --> 00:57:25,758
Well, we've got
to dig in somewhere.

691
00:57:25,843 --> 00:57:26,843
Maybe there's
a public phone.

692
00:57:26,927 --> 00:57:28,344
Dude, you know why
they call it abandoned?

693
00:57:28,429 --> 00:57:30,555
Because there's nothing in
it anymore, including phones!

694
00:57:30,681 --> 00:57:32,098
Hey!
Don't hurt me!

695
00:57:34,893 --> 00:57:36,561
That's a bear trap.

696
00:57:36,645 --> 00:57:37,854
There's no animals
around here.

697
00:57:37,938 --> 00:57:40,857
Why do they have
a fucking bear trap set?

698
00:57:40,941 --> 00:57:44,277
They're not trapping bears.
They're trapping people.

699
00:57:44,903 --> 00:57:48,948
There's no wildlife to eat
around here, they're eating us!

700
00:57:49,033 --> 00:57:50,700
Okay, I was wrong. The
paper mill's a great idea.

701
00:57:50,784 --> 00:57:51,868
Let's just
get out of here.

702
00:57:51,952 --> 00:57:53,369
No, no, no. Look, man,

703
00:57:53,454 --> 00:57:55,413
now we take the road, we're
sitting ducks, all right?

704
00:57:55,497 --> 00:57:59,042
So I want everyone to stick
together and watch where you step.

705
00:57:59,126 --> 00:58:00,626
Yeah, no shit.

706
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:04,213
Yeah.

707
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:34,285
Who you blowing up,
old timer?

708
00:58:34,369 --> 00:58:39,165
Just the trout. Only way to
bring them to the surface.

709
00:58:40,209 --> 00:58:42,251
Dynamite stuns them.

710
00:58:43,003 --> 00:58:47,090
They float like lily pads
and I just scoop them up.

711
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:54,555
Pretty wife.

712
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,891
Ah, that's my Delilah.

713
00:58:56,975 --> 00:59:00,770
Gave me the happiest days
of my life.

714
00:59:00,854 --> 00:59:02,271
God bless her soul.

715
00:59:03,524 --> 00:59:06,275
You know, you one
lucky son of a bitch.

716
00:59:06,777 --> 00:59:10,446
Lot of folk go in them woods.
Never seen one come out.

717
00:59:11,365 --> 00:59:13,783
Now, I stay clear
of them myself.

718
00:59:14,493 --> 00:59:16,536
How many of those freaks
are out there?

719
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:18,162
Hard to know.

720
00:59:18,247 --> 00:59:21,040
More than the ones you run
across, that's for sure.

721
00:59:21,542 --> 00:59:23,042
What are they?

722
00:59:24,002 --> 00:59:29,632
Just like you and me, brother,
except uglier, and a lot stronger.

723
00:59:30,008 --> 00:59:33,553
Hey, I hit one of them
young'uns once in my pickup.

724
00:59:33,804 --> 00:59:36,722
He popped up
and just kept going.

725
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:40,226
It's the chemicals
changed them.

726
00:59:40,519 --> 00:59:44,147
Pulp mill shut down
near 30 years ago,

727
00:59:44,565 --> 00:59:49,986
and left a mess, and the
poison killed off all the game.

728
00:59:50,237 --> 00:59:53,114
Most of the folks
around these parts left.

729
00:59:53,949 --> 00:59:57,910
There's one family
stayed on in this holler,

730
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:03,875
and pretty soon their babies started
gushing out of their mama's womb,

731
01:00:03,959 --> 01:00:07,587
just as ugly as them trout
I got hanging out there,

732
01:00:10,591 --> 01:00:14,135
and then they grow up,
have kids of their own,

733
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:18,306
turned out even worse.

734
01:00:20,642 --> 01:00:23,352
You going to stay
for a bite?

735
01:00:23,437 --> 01:00:26,439
Fish is ugly, but they fry up real good.

736
01:00:27,107 --> 01:00:30,234
No, much obliged,
but I got to get going.

737
01:00:33,906 --> 01:00:38,075
Well, if you're going to head out to
get your friends, settle the score,

738
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,953
best jump to it
before it gets dark.

739
01:00:41,288 --> 01:00:43,748
You don't want to be
out in them woods at night.

740
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:46,459
Why do you stay,
old timer?

741
01:00:46,543 --> 01:00:48,628
Well, I could never leave.

742
01:00:51,632 --> 01:00:55,551
Got to stay close to my
young'uns. You motherfucker!

743
01:00:55,636 --> 01:00:58,304
I going to kill you, man!
I going to kill you!

744
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:00,056
You killed my boy!

745
01:01:01,642 --> 01:01:03,142
I'll kill you!

746
01:01:04,353 --> 01:01:07,813
I'll kill you! I'll
kill you, motherfucker!

747
01:01:08,982 --> 01:01:11,400
I'll kill you,
motherfucker!

748
01:01:11,485 --> 01:01:13,653
I'll kill you!
I'm gonna kill you!

749
01:01:17,866 --> 01:01:20,243
I'll teach you
to mess with my kids.

750
01:01:30,295 --> 01:01:32,588
Say hello to
the missus for me.

751
01:02:12,379 --> 01:02:14,046
It's one of them.

752
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:21,304
It's Elena.

753
01:02:21,388 --> 01:02:23,014
Yeah? What makes you
think that?

754
01:02:26,518 --> 01:02:27,560
Hey!

755
01:02:31,898 --> 01:02:33,316
Get off her!

756
01:02:36,445 --> 01:02:37,486
Oh, my God.

757
01:02:39,823 --> 01:02:41,198
Nina, wait!

758
01:02:46,246 --> 01:02:47,538
Oh, shit!

759
01:03:41,593 --> 01:03:43,386
Help me!

760
01:03:54,314 --> 01:03:56,148
Help!

761
01:04:00,487 --> 01:04:01,278
Where's Nina?

762
01:04:01,363 --> 01:04:02,905
She deserted us.

763
01:04:16,336 --> 01:04:17,920
Son of a bitch!

764
01:04:18,004 --> 01:04:19,338
Just keep moving.

765
01:04:20,841 --> 01:04:22,425
Look, split up.
I'll find Nina.

766
01:04:22,509 --> 01:04:23,843
We'll meet up
at the mill. Go.

767
01:04:37,941 --> 01:04:39,108
Nina.

768
01:04:39,192 --> 01:04:41,402
Help me! Help me!

769
01:04:41,486 --> 01:04:43,028
Nina?
Help me!

770
01:04:57,711 --> 01:04:58,836
Nina.

771
01:04:59,588 --> 01:05:00,921
Down here.

772
01:05:01,673 --> 01:05:03,466
Nina? Are you okay?

773
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:06,010
I'm going to get you
out of there, all right?

774
01:05:06,094 --> 01:05:09,221
Look, come on.
Come on, Nina.

775
01:05:11,308 --> 01:05:12,308
I can't reach!

776
01:05:12,392 --> 01:05:13,726
Come on, Nina.

777
01:05:15,395 --> 01:05:16,604
Almost.

778
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:19,690
Okay, hold on.

779
01:05:22,068 --> 01:05:23,777
I've got you, now.

780
01:05:41,087 --> 01:05:42,129
What happened?

781
01:05:42,214 --> 01:05:45,883
It's my shoulder.
It's dislocated.

782
01:05:45,967 --> 01:05:47,301
You've got to
help me pop it in.

783
01:05:48,136 --> 01:05:50,179
Nina, easy!

784
01:05:50,263 --> 01:05:52,014
Okay, pull and twist, okay?

785
01:05:52,349 --> 01:05:53,432
Go.

786
01:05:55,852 --> 01:05:57,228
Help me up.

787
01:05:58,522 --> 01:05:59,939
It's like going to war.

788
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:03,609
Amber, Jonesy.
Did they make it?

789
01:06:03,693 --> 01:06:06,111
We all made it. We'll meet up
with them at the mill, okay?

790
01:06:07,948 --> 01:06:10,199
Let's go.
Let's go, let's go.

791
01:06:41,147 --> 01:06:42,815
Let's go.
Where?

792
01:07:25,483 --> 01:07:27,276
You totally kicked ass
back there.

793
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:30,863
I'm serious. You were like
Xena, Warrior Princess.

794
01:07:30,947 --> 01:07:33,449
You were right. I was
a total asshole before.

795
01:07:33,533 --> 01:07:36,285
I'm never going to dis you or
any other female ever again.

796
01:07:36,369 --> 01:07:37,661
Great.

797
01:07:38,038 --> 01:07:39,455
It's cool.
We outran them.

798
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:41,790
Run.

799
01:07:49,633 --> 01:07:50,883
Come on.

800
01:07:52,761 --> 01:07:54,136
Oh, shit.

801
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:55,471
Come on.

802
01:08:22,123 --> 01:08:22,998
Jonesy.

803
01:08:23,083 --> 01:08:24,291
Help me! Help me!

804
01:08:24,376 --> 01:08:27,169
Oh, shit. Amber.
Amber, help me.

805
01:08:27,253 --> 01:08:29,213
Jonesy!
Get me down. Get me down.

806
01:08:29,297 --> 01:08:31,215
Oh, no. Oh.

807
01:08:32,967 --> 01:08:34,927
Amber, Amber, help me!

808
01:08:37,138 --> 01:08:39,890
Oh, God. Hurry, Amber,
he's coming.

809
01:08:44,979 --> 01:08:46,188
Amber?

810
01:08:46,272 --> 01:08:47,564
Amber, go.
No!

811
01:08:47,607 --> 01:08:50,150
Amber, don't do this. Get
away. Go. I'm not leaving you!

812
01:08:50,235 --> 01:08:52,111
Run. No.

813
01:08:52,612 --> 01:08:53,946
Amber, no.

814
01:08:54,489 --> 01:08:56,615
Oh, God. Oh, God.

815
01:08:59,661 --> 01:09:00,828
Amber?

816
01:09:01,955 --> 01:09:03,205
Oh, God.

817
01:09:03,790 --> 01:09:05,040
Jonesy.

818
01:09:08,628 --> 01:09:10,379
Jonesy,

819
01:09:11,631 --> 01:09:13,424
give me your hand.

820
01:09:37,449 --> 01:09:38,657
Huh?

821
01:09:45,957 --> 01:09:47,583
Don't look down.

822
01:09:51,254 --> 01:09:52,546
I'm here.

823
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,507
Amber, I'm scared.

824
01:09:56,342 --> 01:09:58,010
You're not alone.

825
01:09:58,887 --> 01:10:01,847
All right, I'm going
to get us out of here.

826
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:06,435
You know, my mother always
used to say I'd live for...

827
01:11:32,772 --> 01:11:34,189
There it is.

828
01:11:34,274 --> 01:11:36,233
Jonesy wasn't kidding.

829
01:11:36,901 --> 01:11:38,610
This place is dead.

830
01:11:51,332 --> 01:11:53,250
Birth defects, no shit!

831
01:12:05,305 --> 01:12:07,055
Can't see anything.

832
01:12:07,599 --> 01:12:10,475
How the hell are we going
to find them in here?

833
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,769
Let Amber and Jonesy find us.

834
01:12:13,521 --> 01:12:14,855
Where did you get that?

835
01:12:14,939 --> 01:12:15,939
I brought it with me
for the game.

836
01:12:16,024 --> 01:12:17,399
I thought it might
come in handy.

837
01:12:17,483 --> 01:12:18,567
That's cheating.

838
01:12:18,651 --> 01:12:19,735
Sue me.

839
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:27,659
You think
they're up there?

840
01:12:27,744 --> 01:12:30,704
Maybe they found a CB
radio, called for help.

841
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:34,416
I guess I'll go first.

842
01:12:37,462 --> 01:12:38,837
Be careful.

843
01:12:54,312 --> 01:12:57,022
They got to be
around here somewhere.

844
01:12:58,733 --> 01:13:01,193
If they even
made it here at all.

845
01:13:06,407 --> 01:13:08,533
Come on, guys,
where you at?

846
01:13:12,538 --> 01:13:16,166
Oh, my God.
She was just a little girl.

847
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:17,501
Looks like she's
been in there forever.

848
01:13:17,585 --> 01:13:18,585
She's hiding.

849
01:13:18,670 --> 01:13:19,586
Yeah, but from whom?

850
01:13:19,671 --> 01:13:20,963
This isn't right.

851
01:13:23,299 --> 01:13:25,717
No, Nina. No, Nina!

852
01:13:25,802 --> 01:13:27,344
It's too late. We've got
to get out of here now!

853
01:13:27,428 --> 01:13:32,140
No! No, Nina. We cannot
leave them, okay? Let's go.

854
01:13:37,981 --> 01:13:39,898
Look, there's the RV.

855
01:13:40,191 --> 01:13:41,358
I don't see them.

856
01:13:41,442 --> 01:13:44,820
Oh, Jesus. This family's
been doing this for decades.

857
01:13:50,326 --> 01:13:52,869
Oh, my God. That sounds
like M screaming.

858
01:13:52,954 --> 01:13:55,080
Okay, I'm going down there.

859
01:14:03,089 --> 01:14:04,464
No, no, no, no.

860
01:14:05,675 --> 01:14:07,092
Hold this.

861
01:14:11,139 --> 01:14:12,431
Shit.

862
01:14:13,349 --> 01:14:15,100
Do you got my back?

863
01:14:19,772 --> 01:14:22,107
Please!
M? M!

864
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:23,859
Come on, come on.

865
01:14:25,111 --> 01:14:27,821
Fuck! Fuck face.

866
01:14:27,905 --> 01:14:30,323
M. Get me the fuck out of here!

867
01:14:44,881 --> 01:14:46,048
M?

868
01:14:46,507 --> 01:14:48,800
No. Fuck, no!

869
01:14:50,178 --> 01:14:52,179
No, please!
Please, God, no!

870
01:14:52,263 --> 01:14:53,555
Please, don't. Please.

871
01:14:53,639 --> 01:14:55,474
M?
Please...

872
01:15:10,031 --> 01:15:13,492
Oh. Help.
Nina, it's a trap!

873
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Oh, shit!

874
01:15:22,085 --> 01:15:23,543
Shit.

875
01:16:10,258 --> 01:16:12,592
Brothers and sisters,
you must know

876
01:16:13,344 --> 01:16:18,849
that we live in a world of technology
that promotes sin, where the...

877
01:16:23,062 --> 01:16:27,732
...extracurricular sexual
activities, homosexuality...

878
01:16:29,652 --> 01:16:31,653
...to exercise...

879
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:33,488
No!

880
01:16:43,249 --> 01:16:45,542
Would it be Heaven or
Hell that you decide?

881
01:16:45,626 --> 01:16:46,918
This is the crossroad...

882
01:16:56,929 --> 01:16:58,722
It is all a test.

883
01:16:59,432 --> 01:17:03,602
It is a test to show us
the way to find the light.

884
01:17:04,103 --> 01:17:06,771
This is what you need
to find your way.

885
01:17:07,315 --> 01:17:10,025
It gives you what you
need to find that light.

886
01:17:10,109 --> 01:17:12,194
To stay away
from the darkness,

887
01:17:12,278 --> 01:17:15,280
do not take wrong turns

888
01:17:16,115 --> 01:17:18,325
to living a life of sin,

889
01:17:20,244 --> 01:17:22,287
of personal destruction,

890
01:17:24,207 --> 01:17:27,042
a painful,
blasphemous life.

891
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:31,087
Here I have the book
that will change your life,

892
01:17:31,172 --> 01:17:35,091
that will let you live
the way God has intended...

893
01:17:46,687 --> 01:17:50,523
...that living a life of
sin will only lead you to.

894
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:57,489
Fuck you!

895
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:12,170
Don't do it.
Leave her alone.

896
01:18:44,328 --> 01:18:45,912
Leave her alone!

897
01:18:46,956 --> 01:18:48,540
Leave her alone.

898
01:18:55,381 --> 01:18:57,257
Stop messing with her.

899
01:19:37,256 --> 01:19:40,008
What the fuck is wrong with you people?

900
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:42,844
Amen.

901
01:19:42,928 --> 01:19:44,262
Amen.

902
01:20:13,125 --> 01:20:15,126
I hope you fucking choke!

903
01:20:19,965 --> 01:20:21,633
Leave her alone!

904
01:22:35,518 --> 01:22:37,310
Please, let us go.

905
01:22:41,273 --> 01:22:43,358
Come on, man. Help!

906
01:22:43,442 --> 01:22:49,531
Help.

907
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:15,807
Help! Help!

908
01:23:19,645 --> 01:23:23,982
Help! Please! We're here. We're trapped!

909
01:23:24,066 --> 01:23:26,192
Please, someone, help us.

910
01:23:26,777 --> 01:23:27,860
Help us.

911
01:23:28,279 --> 01:23:30,113
Fuck!

912
01:25:54,007 --> 01:25:55,258
Oo-rah.

913
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:10,481
Nina. Nina.

914
01:26:11,775 --> 01:26:14,444
Nina. Come on, wake up.

915
01:26:15,028 --> 01:26:16,571
Nina, wake up!

916
01:26:18,365 --> 01:26:20,825
Nina can you pull
your hands free?

917
01:26:23,704 --> 01:26:26,247
I need you to
pull your hands free.

918
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,342
I can't.

919
01:26:38,427 --> 01:26:40,678
Nina, you've
got to try. Nina!

920
01:26:42,806 --> 01:26:44,849
Nina, wake up. Nina.

921
01:26:46,101 --> 01:26:48,144
Dale?
Be quiet.

922
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:58,070
I got to do this.
Breathe through it.

923
01:27:01,408 --> 01:27:03,576
Ready? Okay.

924
01:27:04,036 --> 01:27:05,077
Go.

925
01:27:09,082 --> 01:27:10,416
One more.

926
01:27:16,006 --> 01:27:17,048
Go.

927
01:27:22,012 --> 01:27:23,221
Get up.

928
01:27:25,599 --> 01:27:27,725
There's an exit door
through there.

929
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:29,977
I'll be right
behind you. Go.

930
01:27:41,281 --> 01:27:42,907
I want you
to go find Nina.

931
01:27:44,618 --> 01:27:45,743
Dale!

932
01:27:46,745 --> 01:27:48,871
Hey. Hey. Find Nina.

933
01:27:50,082 --> 01:27:51,707
Go! I've got it. Go!

934
01:28:04,471 --> 01:28:06,597
Is that all
you got, bitch?

935
01:28:27,411 --> 01:28:29,662
Fuck you. Fuck!

936
01:29:28,722 --> 01:29:31,641
Let go of me, you son
of a bitch! Let go of me!

937
01:29:37,314 --> 01:29:40,816
Let go. Let go of me!

938
01:29:40,901 --> 01:29:42,318
Let go of me!

939
01:29:42,527 --> 01:29:43,861
Shit!

940
01:29:44,738 --> 01:29:47,156
Let go of me,
you son of a bitch.

941
01:30:40,293 --> 01:30:41,585
Come on!

942
01:31:55,869 --> 01:31:59,205
You know you didn't have
to come back for me, right?

943
01:31:59,414 --> 01:32:00,581
Sue me.

944
01:32:07,172 --> 01:32:11,050
Wow. Nice ride.

945
01:32:12,010 --> 01:32:14,303
You want to take it
for a spin?

946
01:32:16,556 --> 01:32:17,890
Why not?

947
01:32:17,974 --> 01:32:20,309
It's the least this
fucked up family owes us.
