- You save her?

She's tough.
She saved herself.

42
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,343
We were out there
for a while.

43
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,721
We got cornered, she got out
in front of me and...

44
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,098
I don't know,
she was gone.

45
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,683
I came out
and a car's pulling out

46
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,436
with a white cross
on the window.

47
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,521

Tank's runnin' low.

00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:56,837
We can end this quick.
Just run him off the road.

52
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,340
Nah, we're good for a bit.

53
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:00,508
If they're holding
her somewhere,

54
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:02,301
we can get it out
of the driver.

55
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,721
Yeah, but if he don't talk,
we're back to square one.

56
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,891
Right now we got
the advantage.

57
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,518
We'll see who they are.

58
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:13,562
If they're a group,
see what they can do.

59
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,981
And then we'll do
what we gotta do

60
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,817
to get her back.

61
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:21,612

There's two of 'em.

Is that a cop?

66
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,320

Aw, shit!
Tank's tapped.

73
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,734
They'd have taken the bypass
and they didn't.

74
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,070
They must be holed up
in the city somewhere.

I know a place just a couple
of blocks from here.

78

Hold on.

- Daryl: What's this place?
- It's temporary housing.

89
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,801
You came here?

Carol: We didn't stay.

91
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,982
I'll take the top bunk.

more your style.

I'll take first watch.

- This is locked up pretty tight.
- I know.

Then we're good, then.

97
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,793
I'll keep first watch.
I don't mind.

Suit yourself.

what's really on your mind?

I don't think we get
to save people anymore.

Daryl: That car
was headed downtown.

118
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,589
I say we get up
in one of the tall ones,

119
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,716
get ourselves a view,
see what we see.

120
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,802
Stay close to the buildings
and keep quiet,

121
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:55,472

we're gonna be drawing 'em.

All right,

Mm-mm.

136
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,519
We just did.

137
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,902
You still haven't
asked me what happened.

138
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,197
After I met up
with Tyreese, the girls.

139
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:24,824
Yeah, I know what happened.

140
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,701
They ain't here.

141
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,164
It was worse than that.

142
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:42,133
The reason I said
we get to start over...

143
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,344
is because we gotta.

144
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,767
The way it was...

145
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,316
Yeah.

146
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,742
You see something?

147
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,412
I don't know.
Hand me that rifle.

148
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,390
Right there.

149
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,899
It's been there a while.

150
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:44,571
Definitely one of 'em.

151
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:47,449
It's definitely
some kind of lead.

152
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,288
We should fill up.

153
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,583
All right.

154
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:58,251
Hmm.

155
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:15,810
What?

156
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:19,439
I bet this cost some rich prick
a lot of money.

157
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,153
Looks like a dog
sat in paint,

158
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:27,989
wiped its ass
all over the place.

159
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:33,203
Really?
I kinda like it.

160
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,164

Stop.

161
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:39,334
I'm serious.

162
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:41,002
You don't know me.

163
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:47,509
Yep, you keep
tellin' yourself that.

164
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,932
( walkers snarling )

165
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,491
- Daryl, don't.
- Get up.

166
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:14,077
Hands up.
Both of you.

167
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,834
Lay down your crossbow.

168
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,710
You got some sack on you.

169
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:23,878
Look, nobody has to get hurt.

170
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,755
I just need weapons, that's it.

171
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,967
So, please,
lay down your crossbow.

172
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:40,770
Back up.

173
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,740
- Sorry about this.
- ( walker snarling )

174
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,701
You look tough.

175
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:56,578
You'll be all right.

Three bullets.

181
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:30,153
We're in the middle of a city.
He was stealing our weapons.

182
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,200
Did you think
I was gonna kill him?

183
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:39,037
I was aiming for his leg.

184
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:40,788
Could that have killed him?
Maybe. I don't know.

185
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,707
But he was stealing
our weapons.

186
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,376
He's just a damn kid.

187
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,420
Without weapons
we could die.

188
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:49,339
Beth could die.

189
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:52,717
We'll find more weapons.

190
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,803
I don't want you to die.
I don't want Beth to die.

191
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,472
I don't want anybody
at the church to die,

192
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,642
but I can't stand around
and watch it happen either.

193
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,311
I can't. That's why I left.

194
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,146
I just had to be somewhere else.

195
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:08,149
Well, you ain't somewhere else.
You're right here.

196
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:09,901
Tryin'.

197
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:15,156
Look, you're not who you were
and neither am I.

198
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:18,451
( exhales )

199
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:21,120
I don't know if I believe in God
anymore or heaven,

200
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,790
but if I'm going to hell,
I'm making damn sure

201
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:25,250
I'm holding it off
as long as I can.

202
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,668
( clatter )

203
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:34,050
( clatter )

204
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,043
All right,
let's get this done.

205
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,087
It's not stable.
I'm lighter.

206
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:57,633
( grunts )

207
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:00,553
( snarling )

208
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,272
( Carol grunts )

209
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:19,655
( rattling )

210
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,710
( walkers snarling )

211
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:37,298
There's more coming.

212
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,175
We're gonna
have to fight through.

213
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:40,927
Yeah, I see 'em.

214
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,057
- We have to go.
- GMH, what's that? A hospital?

215
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,600
I don't know.
Grady Memorial, maybe?

216
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:48,768
Grady, the white crosses--

217
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,061
it might be where they're
holing up.

218
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,271
( snarling )

219
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,530
- Carol: Daryl!
- ( squelching )

220
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,448
Daryl:
Go, go, go, go!

221
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,703
( squelching )

222
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:24,137
Anything we can use?

223
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,514
Nothin' but what we got.

224
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:36,107
Daryl:
All right, buckle up.

225
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:45,366
( snarling )

226
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:56,919
You hold on.

227
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:10,266
( snarling continues faintly )

228
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:18,065
- ( Daryl groans )
- We're okay.

229
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,734
We're okay.

230
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:27,283
( bodies thudding )

231
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:34,916
God.

232
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:37,919
( groans )

233
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:48,804
Ow.

234
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:53,100
( walker snarling )

235
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,557
Here.

236
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,016
I'm fine.

237
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:35,726
Prove it.

238
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,656
How bad is it?

239
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,992
I've had worse.

240
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:59,750
Damn, that was stupid.

241
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,586
We made good time down.

242
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,504
( scoffs )

243
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:08,259
There's only three blocks
between us and Grady.

244
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:13,347
We need to find
a place nearby,

245
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,850
scope it out,
see what we can see.

246
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:19,895
You really think
we're gonna find out

247
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:22,857
what we need to know
just by watching?

248
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:25,776
It's where we start.

249
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,445
Come on.

250
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:35,870
( snarling weakly )

251
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,932
It's them.

252
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,734
All right.

253
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:09,111
Let's see what we see.

254
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:15,451
( crunching )

255
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,924
You said I ain't like
how I was before?

256
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,259
Yeah.

257
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,096
How was I?

258
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:39,809
It's like you were a kid.

259
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,813
Now you're a man.

260
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,610
What about you?

261
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,496
Me and Sophia stayed
at that shelter

262
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:03,040
for a day and a half

263
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:06,210
before I went
running back to Ed.

264
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:09,255
I went home,
I got beat up, life went on,

265
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:15,261
and I just kept praying
for something to happen.

266
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:18,472
But I didn't do anything.

267
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,267
Not a damn thing.

268
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:28,315
Who I was with him...

269
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:29,900
she got burned away.

270
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,738
And I was happy about that.
I mean, not happy, but...

271
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,240
And at the prison

272
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:41,120
I got to be who I always
thought I should be,

273
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:43,831
thought I should've been.

274
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,170
And then she got burned away.

275
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:57,178
Everything now just...

276
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,847
consumes you.

277
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,022
Well, hey...

278
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,774
we ain't ashes.

279
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,284
( distant door closes )

280
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,965
( thudding )

281
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,637
( walker snarling )

282
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:46,936
( thudding continues )

283
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,647
( snarling continues )

284
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,236
Is that yours?

285
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,321
Yeah.

286
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,748
- ( automatic gunfire )
- ( walker snarling )

287
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,757
( yelling )

288
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:21,345
( groans )
Oh, God.

289
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:24,765
I'm good.

290
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,767
I'm good. You go.

291
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:30,062
God.
( panting )

292
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,232
( man grunting )

293
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:53,586
- ( snarling )
- ( groaning, gasping )

294
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:59,800
Plea-- please.
I had to protect myself.

295
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,260
Why you following us?

296
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:03,470
I-I didn't, I swear!
I thought you followed me.

297
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,972
Bullshit.

298
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,266
( walker continues snarling )

299
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,067
Noah: Come on, man.
Plea-- please!

300
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,236
( groans )

301
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:22,156
- Please, please.
- Nah.

302
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:24,074
I already helped you once.

303
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,869
It ain't happenin' again.

304
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,663
Noah:
Please.

305
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:32,833
( walker continues snarling )

306
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,503
Have fun with Hoss
over there.

307
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,005
Noah:
No. No, no, no.

308
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,424
No. No, no, no!
Please! Please!

309
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,009
Please!
I'm sorry, please!

310
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:44,678
- Please! Please, please!
- Daryl. Daryl. Stop.

311
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,263
You almost died 'cause of him!

312
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,015
But I didn't.

313
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,023
Nah, let him be.

314
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,860
- Noah: I'm sorry.
- Daryl!

315
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:01,028
Noah: Please, I'm sorry!

316
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:03,530
( yelling )

317
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,699
( snarling )

318
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:19,088
( distant gunfire )

319
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:43,529
( distant gunfire continues )

320
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,228
( grunting )

321
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:19,189
Come on,
just a little more.

322
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,692
Oh, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

323
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,861
( panting )

324
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,907
Daryl:
You okay?

325
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,912
You okay?

326
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,248
I'm still here.

327
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,584
I gotta go. I gotta go.

328
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,753
They're gonna come.
They probably heard the shot.

329
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,921
If they find me...

330
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,466
- Who?
- Them. People at the hospital.

331
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:46,633
Wait, wait, wait,
just tell us--

332
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:47,968
is there
a blonde girl there?

333
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:50,721
- You see a blonde girl?
- Beth?

334
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,473
Daryl: You know her?

335
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:56,393
She helped me get out,
but she's still there.

336
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,648
They're coming.

337
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,109
We gotta go now.
We gotta go. We gotta go.

338
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,323
The building next door
has a basement.

339
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:11,825
It's clear.
We'll be safe.

340
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:13,619
Ah! Ah!

341
00:40:13,787 --> 00:40:15,245
Daryl:
Go, I got him.

342
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,747
Come on, get up.

343
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:19,625
- Get up.
- ( groans ) Okay.

344
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:23,170
( tires screech )

345
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,924
No, no, no!
Wait, wait, wait!

346
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:28,717
- Let go of me!
- Wait! They can help her.

347
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:30,135
They're the only ones who can.

348
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:33,514
They have medicine,
machines, a doctor.

349
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,809
You go out there,
you'll have to kill them, okay?

350
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,478
And then she can't get their help.
Is that what you want?

351
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:42,147
( panting )

352
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:44,608
We can get her back.
We can get Beth back.

353
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:50,739
What's it gonna take?

354
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:53,617
A lot.

355
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:56,870
They got guns, people.

356
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,666
So do we.

357
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,504
( snarling )

358
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,116
( theme music playing )
