I ain't slaying a lion

After you get on that terminal

42
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,249
Depends on a number of factors,

43
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:06,876
including density of the infected

44
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,420

45
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,297
Wait, target sites?

00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,924

Glenn:
The secrets will matter then?

51
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:25,019
They might.

52
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:27,313
Anyway, the speed
with which things normalize

53
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,689

weather patterns,

55
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,818

without the assumption

56
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,861

boats, and trains

57
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:35,530

you're good.

This is how things stop.

150
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,782
I can't afford that right now.
The world can't afford it.

151
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,912
Listen, I took a pretty hard shot
to the sack with that crash.

152

I am stressed and depressed
to see that ride die,

153
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,708
but if you say we're rolling on,

154
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,253
I'm good.

155
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,218
We're rolling on.

156
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:55,552
I'm gonna rub some dirt on it
and walk it off.

00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,554
Yeah.

like we always have--

- on the way.
- Okay.

160
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,645
I'm not rubbing dirt
on anything.

00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:59,004
Okay.

184
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,357
( thudding )

185
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:30,577
Hey.

186
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,829
Hey.

187
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,208
Thank you.

188
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,544
( chuckles )
For what?

189
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,838
Showing up.

190
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,840
It took a little horse trading
to get you here,

191
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:48,679
but it's plain
as potatoes to me now.

192
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,764
You get it.

193
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,016
You could have lit out
after the crash, made a case.

194
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,268
But you stayed.

195
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,354
- I made a deal.
- Yeah, you could've broke it.

196
00:14:57,522 --> 00:15:00,524
( sniffs )
What was I gonna do?

197
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,445
You gonna put that thing
away tonight?

198
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:13,120
How about that?
You gonna wrap that up?

199
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,289
No, I'm gonna
let it get some air.

200
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,915
Got cut up
pretty ugly last night

201
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:20,460
back at the church.

202
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,046
Yeah.

203
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,679
Gotten to the point
where everyone alive

204
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,222
is strong now.

205
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,018
We have to be.

206
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,185
You're either strong

207
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,729
and they can help you,
so you help them,

208
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:42,899
or you're strong
and they can kill ya.

209
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:48,822
So you gotta kill them.

210
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,325
You gotta kill them and...

211
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,917
( sighs )

212
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:04,671
I want to say it's never easy.

213
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,801
That's not the truth.

214
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:20,437
It's the easiest thing
in the world now.

215
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:33,867
The world's gonna change, right?

216
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,619
You're damn right it's gonna.

217
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,166
You'd better turn in.
You got late watch.

218
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:44,169
Yeah.

219
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:51,009
I really need some ass first.

220
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:57,307
Didn't need to know that,
but, cool.

221
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:04,815
( panting )

222
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,733
Abraham!

223
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,235
He's watching again.

224
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:11,238
Over there in
the self-help section.

225
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:14,866
( both laugh )

226
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,161
- Abraham: "Self-help."
- ( both laughing )

227
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,165
Abraham:
Don't worry about him, baby.

228
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,334
He's harmless.

229
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:25,711
- ( Rosita moans )
- Come on.

230
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,838
( Rosita moaning )

231
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,006
Dude.

232
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,929
Cards on the table.
I was watching them.

233
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,723
Yeah, I saw that.

234
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,850
I believe they know
I catch an eyeful on occasion,

235
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,894
which isn't to say it's their thing.
It's not mine either.

236
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,521
It's just that I enjoy
the female form

237
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,189
and I consider this
a victimless crime

238
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,358
that provides both
comfort and distraction.

239
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:51,361
( moaning continues )

240
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:55,031
Maybe, uh-- maybe we can
move on from here.

241
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,200
I was looking for you
to say thank you

242
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:58,702
for having my back
at the bus.

243
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:02,038
You saved my life.

244
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,624
- Don't know about that.
- You did.

245
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,877
Well, if I did,
then you provided the context

246
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,336
for me doing so.

247
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,921
- What?
- I was screwed either way,

248
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,382
so I went with the choice
that helped someone.

249
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,468
I thought it trite,
but it turned out to be true.

250
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,970
- Point to you.
- You have this.

251
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:20,807
Even if you didn't before, you do.

252
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,143
Look, I'm--
I'm the same way.

253
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:25,312
You know you can do this.

254
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:31,902
Uh, did you hear
what I just said?

255
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,780
The bus crashed
'cause of me.

256
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,949
- No, it didn't.
- Yes, it did.

257
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,161
I put crushed glass
in the fuel line.

258
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:44,581
Light bulbs I found
in the church.

259
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,626
The vehicle should've failed

260
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:48,794
before it ever got to the road.

261
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,253
You would've killed us.

262
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:51,463
It wasn't supposed
to go down like that.

263
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:52,756
Not hardly, not half.

264
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:55,258
The glass wasn't supposed
to wear out the fuel line

265
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,427
next to the spark plugs.

266
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,304
We fully pulled
a short straw on that one.

267
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,432
What the hell?
Why did you do that?

268
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:08,271
Eugene, why did--
Eugene?

269
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,941
Why did you do that?

270
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,445
- Um...
- Answer me.

271
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,949
I appreciate
the positive affirmations

272
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,201
and looking the other way
on the perversion,

273
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,370
but I know empirically
and definitively

274
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:24,871
that I cannot survive
on my own.

275
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,457
- I cannot.
- So you killed the bus?

276
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,838
If I don't cure the disease,

277
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,382
if I don't save the world,
I have no value.

278
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,134
- That's not how it works.
- If I don't fix things,

279
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,470
there's no way you people
would keep me around,

280
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:42,722
share resources,
even protect me.

281
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,683
Of course we would.

282
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:47,310
We're friends.

283
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:50,397
We have each other's backs.
That's it.

284
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:52,190
That's how it works.

285
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,863
Don't tell anyone else
what you did.

286
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,074
I'll keep your secret
and we'll keep going.

287
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,159
You know you messed up.

288
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,996
You're trying, but, dude,

289
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,999
you can't do something
like that again.

290
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,876
I won't.

291
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:16,006
You're stuck with us.

292
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,674
Just like we're stuck with you,

293
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,051
no matter what.

294
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,596
I don't know why I told you.

295
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,347
I do.

296
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,683
( soft laugh )

297
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,352
Welcome to the human race,
asshole.

298
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,653
Come on.
It's getting late.

299
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:48,538
( panting, moaning increases )

300
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:49,956
( sighs )

301
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:59,466
You thinking about them?

302
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:01,259
Yeah.

303
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,804
I feel guilty.

304
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,310
Hey.

305
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:18,276
Hey, we get to have...

306
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:23,073
little vacations
on bookstore floors.

307
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:32,332
We're not back there anymore.

308
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,167
We're living for something else.

309
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:38,630
And they don't get to right now.

310
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:43,593
Well, we did almost die today.

311
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:46,262
And we don't have a car.

312
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,431
And we're drinking toilet water.

313
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:56,940
It just feels really good
having this...

314
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,945
because it's not about what was.

315
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,449
Not last night.

316
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,453
It's all about what's gonna be.

317
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,125
Don't feel guilty about that.

318
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,970
Ellen.

319
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,354
You're safe now.

320
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,902
I stopped 'em.

321
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:30,533
You don't have to be
scared now.

322
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,417
Hey--

323
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,471
It's okay.

324
00:23:57,728 --> 00:24:00,730
It's not infected.

325
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:04,776
You been going to
nursing school on the sly?

326
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,694
Roger and Pam taught me.

327
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,197
Mm.

328
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,244
I think we should
stay here today.

329
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,122
No.

330
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,165
You got some reading
you need to catch up on?

331
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:22,043
We got lucky yesterday.

332
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:24,420
But we're all banged up,
you especially.

333
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,422
We've been through worse.

334
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,675
We keep moving.

335
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:31,094
Maybe we always wind up stopping

336
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:33,096
because we never start at 100%.

337
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:34,931
Every minute we waste
getting him to Washington,

338
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:36,432
people are dying.

339
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,935
You think I don't
understand that?

340
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:40,270
After everything?

341
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:45,608
You see, I want us
to actually get there.

342
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:47,443
No, you want us
to sit around.

343
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,529
You want us to stop.

344
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:53,950
( scoffs )

345
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,788
Maggie:
This town isn't in bad shape.

346
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:01,958
This store wasn't even touched.

347
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,172
We could make
a good base here.

348
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,133
We could spend one last day
doing a sweep for supplies.

349
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:12,343
We'll sweep as we go.

350
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,511
We've done it since Houston.

351
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:14,971
We're not stopping now.

352
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:21,144
You heard the lady.

353
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:22,979
We're taking it north.

354
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:25,231
Tara:
We tapped out the toilet.

355
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:27,817
Broad River
is five miles west.

356
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:28,985
At the very least,

357
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:31,362
we stock up there
before we find wheels.

358
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,156
We got a vehicle.

359
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:38,244
And it just so happens...

360
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:41,331
it's got 500 gallons
of water on it.

361
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:07,065
( grunts )

362
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,777
( humming )

363
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,950
( engine whirring )

364
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:25,583
( engine starts )

365
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,710
( laughs )

366
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:30,797
About time things
started going our way!

367
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,736
( engine stops )

368
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:57,282
Come on.

369
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,908
Just once.

370
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:02,745
Just one damn time.

371
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:06,040
We'll find another ride.

372
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:07,208
If there was a ride
worth a shit in this town,

373
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:08,835
we'd have seen it.

374
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:11,504
This thing's done
some crowd clearing.

375
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:13,464
Right up into the intake.

376
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:14,716
Which means we've got an air filter

377
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,968
filled with
damn human remains.

378
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:22,807
There is no damned corner
on this damned Earth

379
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:26,102
that has not been dicked hard

380
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,271
beyond all damned recognition.

381
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:30,815
- Abraham?
- What?

382
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,400
That feeds the radiator.

383
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:34,777
The intake for the engine
is actually on the roof.

384
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,534
( tire thumps )

385
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:52,545
( snarling )

386
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:54,630
Tara! Maggie!

387
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,550
One damn town!

388
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:03,056
- One damn town!
- Rosita: Abraham, just wait!

389
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:06,517
( snarling continues )

390
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,853
There's more from the back!

391
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:25,244
( growling )

392
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,104
( faint growling )

393
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,523
I been to eight county fairs

394
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,192
and one goat rodeo.

395
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,861
I never seen anything like that.

396
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,201
There was a Goodwill
over there by the bookstore.

397
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:07,495
It's pretty blown up,
but there might be some supplies,

398
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,080
some dry clothes, maybe?

399
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,207
Not necessary.

400
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:14,544
I can clear that intake
in two shakes.

401
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,088
Then the engine
will get some wind

402
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,132
and so will we.

403
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,217
You'll air-dry.

404
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:23,469
We roll on.

405
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:30,560
( laughing )

406
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:40,736
What?

407
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,156
This shit is screwed up!

408
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,575
( laughing )

409
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,261
( gasps )

410
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,017
Ellen?

411
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:14,770
AJ?

412
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,023
Becca?

413
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:26,616
( yells )
Ellen!

414
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,621
Ellen!

415
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,498
( humming )

416
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:37,710
- ( clanking )
- Come on.

417
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:40,630
( humming continues )

418
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:47,220
( clanking continues )

419
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:14,372
I know why
you have the haircut.

420
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,249
I told you,
it's 'cause I like it.

421
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:19,335
I believe that.
I like it, too.

422
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,922
I think you like it for a reason.

423
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:30,179
You're not the person
people think you are.

424
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:32,181
You want 'em
to know who you are.

425
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:38,104
Not following you.

426
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:39,730
If you didn't have
that mullet,

427
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,858
you'd probably be like
everybody else in the labs.

428
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:47,029
But you're not
like everybody else.

429
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:48,573
I think a lot of people
in your position

430
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,741
probably would've given up,

431
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,368
but you didn't.

432
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:56,038
There were people--
a lot of them along the way--

433
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:57,873
they made sure I didn't give up.

434
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,750
It wasn't me remotely.

435
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,545
It was.

436
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:05,590
You started this thing.

437
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,926
And you're not like Samson.
He was kind of a mess.

438
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,803
Not following you.

439
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:13,639
Well, his story goes...

440
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:16,100
that one day
when a lion attacked him,

441
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:18,936
God gave him strength
and he tore it apart.

442
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:21,397
Then he goes back one day,
he's by himself,

443
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:25,484
and he sees that bees have made
a hive in the carcass.

444
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,737
So later he tells
this riddle to people.

445
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,989
"Out of the eater,
something to eat.

446
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:34,285
Out of the strong,
something sweet."

447
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,412
And I always thought,

448
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,915
how the hell are people
supposed to know the answer

449
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,959
when it's just
about his own life?

450
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:45,921
When the only place the answer is
is in his own head?

451
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,299
Glenn:
Whoa, what the hell is that?

452
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,136
What?

453
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,430
Wind's picking up.
You're about to smell it.

454
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:56,766
- ( all groan )
- Maggie: What is that?

455
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,185
Whatever's making that stench,

456
00:32:59,353 --> 00:33:01,646
it ain't nothing nice.

457
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,192
We're not stopping.

458
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,028
Uh, we're stopped.

459
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:25,378
( wind rustling )

460
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:42,645
( coughs )

461
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:05,584
Let's go
We're gonna go.

462
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,336
Abraham:
I will not lie down.

463
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:10,506
Abraham.

464
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:12,258
( softly )
I will not abase.

465
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:15,219
Abraham, let's get out of here.

466
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:18,013
I will not give up the ship.

467
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,185
( normal volume )
Hold up.

468
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:26,856
- Maggie: We gotta go.
- No.

469
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,442
No, we don't.

470
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:32,027
They can't hear us
and they can't see us.

471
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,571
Not from here.

472
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,614
We're fine.

473
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,908
Tara: Yeah, this is
the definition of fine.

474
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,869
Glenn: We need the map.
There's gotta be a detour.

475
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,996
Not doing it.

476
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:44,206
We detoured and detoured and detoured
from Houston to Georgia.

477
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:46,584
I'm not playing
that game anymore.

478
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:49,378
We are not going
through this, okay?

479
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:50,880
It isn't gonna happen.

480
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,381
You got a shitstorm
behind door A

481
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:54,717
and a storm of shit
behind door B.

482
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:58,137
If you're lucky,
it's walkers or a shot-up truck.

483
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:00,389
But sooner or later
you get cornered.

484
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:03,434
You wind up staying
and you wind up killing.

485
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:07,229
We don't go back.
We can't go back.

486
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:09,315
I'm not talking
about going back.

487
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:12,109
- Just south a few miles.
- No.

488
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:13,444
Eugene:
We already hit a full stop

489
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:17,239
'cause of an air filter
compromised by innards.

490
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:18,449
That will happen again.

491
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20,242
Then we'll hit 'em with the hose.

492
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,995
Rosita:
The tank is empty, Abraham.

493
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:24,830
- If we floor it--
- We still hit them,

494
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:26,999
they still slow us down,
and then they stop us.

495
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:28,501
I'm not saying
we just go straight.

496
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,002
That's the way the road goes.

497
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,755
- Abraham.
- We can get through!

498
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:34,173
I know it!

499
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:37,426
And that means
we are not going south,

500
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:40,262
going around, or going back!

501
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,681
Rosita: No.

502
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:47,686
They're right.

503
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,994
- Rosita: Abraham.
- Glenn: Hey! Hey!

504
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,372
- What are you doing? Stop.
- Glenn: Let go of him.

505
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,832
Rosita:
I'm not gonna let you do this.

506
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,708
- Yes, you are.
- Hey, hey, stop.

507
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,836
Hey, you are done!
You're done!

508
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,546
- Do not! Do not!
- Stop!

509
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:17,174
I told you, you do not touch me!
You do not touch me!

510
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:21,053
- Abraham!
- ( all shouting )

511
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:22,304
Rosita:
Abraham!

512
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:23,514
I'm not a scientist!

513
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:26,475
I'm not a scientist!

514
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:30,980
I lied.

515
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:33,649
I'm not a scientist.

516
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:39,154
I don't know how to stop it.

517
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,490
I'm not a scientist.

518
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,063
Rosita:
You are a scientist.

519
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,232
I've seen the things
that you can do.

520
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:19,528
I just know things.

521
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:23,365
You just... know things?

522
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:26,785
I know I'm smarter
than most people,

523
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,078
I know I'm a very good liar,

524
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,372
and I know I needed
to get to DC.

525
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,584
Why?

526
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,169
Because I do believe that locale

527
00:37:35,337 --> 00:37:36,879
holds the strongest
possibility for survival,

528
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:40,049
and I wanted to survive.

529
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,051
If I could cheat some people
into taking me there,

530
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:46,221
well, I just reasoned that
I'd be doing them a solid, too,

531
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,140
considering the perilous state
of the city of Houston,

532
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:50,267
the state of everything.

533
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:02,237
People died
trying to get you here.

534
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,573
I'm aware of that--

535
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:09,078
Stephanie, Warren, Pam,

536
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:13,415
Rex, Roger, Josiah,
Dirk, and Josephine.

537
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,586
And Bob.

538
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:22,466
You see, I lost my nerve
as we grew closer,

539
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:25,636
( voice breaks )
for I am a coward...

540
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:28,305
and the reality of
getting to our destination

541
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:29,640
and disclosing
the truth of the matter

542
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,434
became some
truly frightening shit.

543
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:34,853
I took it upon myself
to slow our roll...

544
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:39,858
find time to finesse things,
so then when we got there...

545
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:44,363
But at this moment,
I fully realize

546
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:46,615
there are no longer
any agreeable options.

547
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:51,120
I was screwed either way.

548
00:38:57,711 --> 00:38:59,545
I also lied about T. Brooks Ellis
liking my hair.

549
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:01,630
I do not know T. Brooks Ellis.

550
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:03,966
But I did read one of his books,
and he seemed like

551
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:05,592
the type of guy
that wouldn't blink twice

552
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,011
at a Tennessee Top Hat.

553
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,893
Again...

554
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,854
I am smarter than you.

555
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:18,063
Now, you may want
to leave me here--

556
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:19,648
- ( gun clatters )
- ( grunts )

557
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:21,734
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey, come on!

558
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:24,987
- Get off of him!
- ( roars )

559
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:29,366
- Maggie: Oh, my God.
- Glenn: No.

560
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,912
Maggie:
Eugene?

561
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:54,183
Get up.
Look at me.

562
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:59,855
Oh, my God.

563
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,027
Oh, God.
Eugene, are you there?

564
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,031
Eugene!

565
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:10,783
Eugene!

566
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,047
Come on!

567
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:28,425
Abraham:
Ellen.

568
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,008
Eugene:
Help me!

569
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,760
( snarling, growling )

570
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:14,596
Help!
Help me!

571
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:20,018
( whimpers )

572
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,020
Help me, please!

573
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:24,940
Get them.
Get 'em!

574
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:27,359
( growling )

575
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:34,491
Get them.
Get 'em.

576
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:37,035
Thank you.

577
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,829
Thank you.

578
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:43,292
I think-- I think they're
getting faster.

579
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,794
Wait!

580
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:47,713
Wait up!

581
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,300
Stop!

582
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:55,220
- You can't leave!
- Why?

583
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:04,313
I have a very
important mission.

584
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:18,994
