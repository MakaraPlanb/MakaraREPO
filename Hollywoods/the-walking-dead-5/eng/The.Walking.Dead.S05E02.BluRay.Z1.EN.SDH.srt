1
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:32,281
Not so fast.

2
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,925
You didn't want to be there.

3
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,469
That's why I tried to talk to you.

4
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:58,808
Glenn told me you saved his life.

5
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,519
He saved mine.

6
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,440
That's how it works
with us, right?

7
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,483
Right.

8
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:10,737
Hey.

9
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,158
( chuckles )

10
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,201
Get something to eat.

11
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,120
We'll start back at sunup.

12
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,825
Talked to Rick.

13
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:02,205
Some of them know
what you did at the prison.

14
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,834
Daryl, Maggie.

15
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:09,378
They accept it.

16
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,881
You wouldn't be here
if they didn't.

17
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,635
Gonna talk to the rest of them.

18
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:18,054
Tell them to accept it, too.

19
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,973
They don't have to.

20
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,229
No, they do.

21
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,023
They just do.

22
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:37,073
We don't need to tell them
about the girls.

23
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,158
I don't want to.

24
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,078
Why?

25
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:45,039
I just need to forget it.

26
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,913
I got it.

27
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,124
( snarling )

28
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,142
Right there is why
we're waiting for our moment.

29
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,732
Yeah, fair enough.

30
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,116
I owe you everything.

31
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,329
You owe Tyreese.
He was at the prison.

32
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,917
You got back there.

33
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,643
It was in one
of their storerooms.

34
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:32,396
I saw them kill him.

35
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,523
That kid.

36
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,620
Mm-mmm.

37
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,381
I still don't know
about what you did...

38
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:04,011
but I know you knew
some things I didn't.

39
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,473
I sent you away to this--

40
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:11,060
You said I could survive.
You were right.

41
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,734
I sent you away to this
and now we're joining you.

42
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,742
Will you have us?

43
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,834
Thank you.

44
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,693
I don't want to talk about it.

45
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,155
I can't.

46
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,163
I just need to forget it.

47
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,793
All right.

48
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,262
( leaves rustling )

49
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,972
( twig snaps )

50
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,810
All right.

51
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,862
It's nothing.

52
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,915
( theme music playing )

53
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:43,045
We surrender.

54
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:49,635
No tracks. No nothing.

55
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,595
So whatever you heard
last night...

56
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:54,390
It's more what I felt.

57
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:56,725
If someone was watching us,

58
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,519
there would have
been something.

59
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:04,233
( whistles )
Keep close.

60
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,194
Ready to get some concrete
under your feet?

61
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,904
I think it's time.

62
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,740
That is sweet music
to my ears, Officer.

63
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,576
Take the next road
we come to,

64
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,911
try to get back to going north
till we find a vehicle.

65
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,873
- Good?
- Good.

66
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,417
Tighten it up.

67
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,586
Uh, wet socks.

68
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,129
Cool feet.

69
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:26,755
Mosquito bites.

70
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,175
Itching reminds you you're alive.

71
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,427
Danger around every corner.

72
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,013
Never a dull moment.

73
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,307
The hot sun
beating down on you.

74
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,101
Come on, a glorious tan.

75
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,811
( laughs )

76
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,189
I said it and I meant it.

77
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,692
No privacy.

78
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,277
Captive audience.

79
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,198
One more.

80
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,033
One more.

81
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,162
He's a damn expert at that.

82
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,206
- What was it?
- A little game.

83
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,750
Good out of the bad.

84
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:05,127
Man:
Help!

85
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,963
- Help, anybody! Help!
- Dad, come on.

86
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,466
- ( man screaming )
- Come on!

87
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,635
- Come on.
- Anyone, help!

88
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,136
Help!

89
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,097
- ( snarling )
- Help! Help! Help!

90
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,683
Anybody, help!

91
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,352
Help!

92
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,480
Help!

93
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,690
Help! Help!

94
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,817
Help! Help!

95
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,195
Help!

96
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:33,322
( gunshot )

97
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,829
Whoa! Whoa!

98
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,632
We're clear. Keep watch.

99
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,014
Rick:
Come on down.

100
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:11,735
You okay?

101
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,664
Sorry.

102
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,002
Yes.

103
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,712
Thank you.

104
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,090
I'm Gabriel.

105
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,591
Do you have
any weapons on you?

106
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,427
( chuckles )

107
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,264
Do I look like
I would have any weapons?

108
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:44,226
We don't give two short and curlies
what it looks like.

109
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,354
I have no weapons of any kind.

110
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:50,065
The word of God
is the only protection I need.

111
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,693
Sure didn't look like it.

112
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:57,823
I called for help.
Help came.

113
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,750
Do you have--

114
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,085
have any food?

115
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,839
Whatever I--

116
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:17,551
I had left,
it just hit the ground.

117
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,304
We've got some pecans.

118
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,266
Thank you.

119
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,438
( Judith cooing )

120
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,069
That's a beautiful child.

121
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:49,166
- Do you have a camp?
- No. Do you?

122
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:54,922
I have a church.

123
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,800
Hold your hands
above your head.

124
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,639
How many walkers
have you killed?

125
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,476
Not any, actually.

126
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,144
Turn around.

127
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,815
How many people
have you killed?

128
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,819
None.

129
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,821
Why?

130
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,826
Because the Lord
abhors violence.

131
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,330
What have you done?

132
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,504
We've all done something.

133
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,341
I'm a sinner.

134
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,927
I sin almost every day.

135
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,389
But those sins,
I confess them to God,

136
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:47,766
not strangers.

137
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,560
You said you had a church?

138
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,191
Rick:
Hey, earlier,

139
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,735
were you watching us?

140
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,946
I keep to myself.

141
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,948
Nowadays, people
are just as dangerous

142
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,533
as the dead,
don't you think?

143
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,702
No, people are worse.

144
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,204
Gabriel:
Well, I wasn't watching you.

145
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,123
I haven't been beyond
the stream near my church

146
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,875
more than a few times
since it all started.

147
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,043
That was the furthest
I've gone before today.

148
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,050
Or maybe I'm lying.

149
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,385
Maybe I'm lying about everything

150
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,387
and there's
no church ahead at all.

151
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,014
Maybe I'm leading you
into a trap

152
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:28,849
so I can steal
all your squirrels.

153
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:38,025
Members of my flock
had often told me

154
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:41,278
that my sense of humor
leaves much to be desired.

155
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,071
Yeah, it does.

156
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,761
Hold up.

157
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:08,347
Can we take a look
around first?

158
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,517
We just want to hold on
to our squirrels.

159
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,896
( whistles )

160
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,192
I spent months here

161
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,735
without stepping out
the front door.

162
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,404
If you found
someone inside,

163
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,239
well, it would have
been surprising.

164
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,910
Thanks for this.

165
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,204
We found a short bus
out back.

166
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,247
It don't run,
but I bet we could fix that

167
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,749
in less than a day or two.

168
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,584
Father here says
he doesn't want it.

169
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,170
Looks like we found ourselves
some transport.

170
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,174
You understand what's
at stake here, right?

171
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,759
Yes, I do.

172
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:51,927
Now that we can take a breath--

173
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,762
We take a breath,
we slow down,

174
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,263
shit inevitably goes down.

175
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,766
We need supplies
no matter what we do next.

176
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,936
That's right.
Water, food, ammunition.

177
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,939
Short bus ain't going nowhere.

178
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,108
Bring you back
some baked beans.

179
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,863
One way or another,
we're doing what Rick does.

180
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,240
We're not splitting up again.

181
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,414
What he said.

182
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:27,462
We want to roll with you, but...
what she said.

183
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,430
How'd you survive here
for so long?

184
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,640
Where did your supplies
come from?

185
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,644
Luck.

186
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,980
Our annual canned food drive.

187
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:47,649
Things fell apart
right after we finished it.

188
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,151
It was just me.

189
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,027
Come here, Judith.

190
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,113
The food lasted a long time.

191
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,574
And then I started scavenging.

192
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,326
I've cleaned out
every place nearby.

193
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,245
Except for one.

194
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,831
What kept you from it?

195
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:04,666
It's overrun.

196
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,251
How many?

197
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,837
A dozen or so.
Maybe more.

198
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,966
Rick:
We can handle a dozen.

199
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,302
Bob and I will go with you.

200
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,513
Tyreese should stay here,
help keep Judith safe.

201
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,599
Rick:
That'll be okay?

202
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,601
Sure.

203
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,187
You ever need me
to watch her,

204
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,023
need anything for her,
I'm right here.

205
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:30,192
I'm grateful for it.

206
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,195
And everything else.

207
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,406
- I'll draw you a map.
- You don't need to.

208
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,492
You're coming with us.

209
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,037
I'm not gonna be of any help.

210
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:43,872
You saw me.

211
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,291
I'm no good around those things.

212
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,460
You're coming with us.

213
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:56,843
Listen, I don't trust this guy.

214
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:58,053
Why?

215
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,640
Why do you trust him?

216
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,726
Everybody can't be bad.

217
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,145
( chuckles )

218
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,731
Well...

219
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,067
I don't trust this guy.

220
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:14,736
And that's why
I'm bringing him with me.

221
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,073
But he could have friends.

222
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:19,866
So I need you to stay alert

223
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:23,036
and help Tyreese
protect Judith, okay?

224
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:26,081
Now...

225
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:29,251
I need you to hear
what I'm about to say.

226
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,919
Okay.

227
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,049
You are not safe.

228
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,886
No matter how many
people are around

229
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,930
or how clear the area looks,

230
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,431
no matter what anyone says,

231
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,267
no matter what you think,

232
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,102
you are not safe.

233
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:50,438
It only takes one second.

234
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,984
One second and it's over.

235
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:58,113
Never let your guard down, ever.

236
00:19:58,281 --> 00:19:59,823
I want you to promise me.

237
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:02,576
- I promise.
- Okay.

238
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,619
Dad.

239
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,958
You're right.
I am strong.

240
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:12,127
We both are.

241
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,463
But we're strong enough

242
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,300
that we can still help people.

243
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,303
And we can handle ourselves
if things go wrong.

244
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,139
And we're strong enough

245
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:26,266
that we don't have
to be afraid

246
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,560
and we don't have to hide.

247
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,356
Well, he's hiding something.

248
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,322
I'll stay safe, Dad.

249
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,533
All right.

250
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,962
Hey.

251
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:59,007
When you said
they don't get to live,

252
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,176
you weren't wrong.

253
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,680
We push ourselves
and let things go.

254
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:09,142
Then we let some more go
and some more.

255
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,354
And pretty soon,
there's things we can't get back.

256
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,981
Things we couldn't
hold on to even if we tried.

257
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,277
Washington's
gonna happen, Rick.

258
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,655
I haven't decided
if we're going.

259
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,698
Yeah, I know, and that's cool.

260
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,825
But you've seen
Abraham in action.

261
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,536
He's gonna get there
and Eugene's gonna cure all this

262
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,372
and you're gonna find
yourself in a place

263
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,248
where it's like how it used to be.

264
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,834
And if you've let too much go
along the way,

265
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,003
that's not gonna work.

266
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,549
'Cause you gonna be back
in the real world.

267
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:45,345
This is the real world, Bob.

268
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:46,513
Naw.

269
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:50,058
This is a nightmare,
and nightmares end.

270
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:53,228
I'm sorry. I'm calling it.

271
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:56,606
Washington's gonna happen.
You're gonna say yes.

272
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,942
Already too much momentum.

273
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,569
You can't fight city hall.

274
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,030
Maybe that's just
one of those parts

275
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,532
of not letting go.

276
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,248
Hey, I get it.

277
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:16,334
You don't want to talk about it.

278
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,753
You okay?

279
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,755
Gotta be.

280
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,758
We get to start over.

281
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,219
All of us with each other.

282
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:31,182
You saved us all by yourself.

283
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,726
We got lucky.

284
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,853
We all should be dead.

285
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:39,774
I'll check it.

286
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:41,609
Daryl:
All right.

287
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,128
Hey.

288
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:03,089
We ain't dead.

289
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:06,134
And whatever happened,
happened.

290
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,973
Let's start over.

291
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:16,061
- I want to.
- Well, you can.

292
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,691
( humming )

293
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,488
We should leave this
here for backup

294
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,782
in case things go south
at the church.

295
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,744
Want me to carry
one of those?

296
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:37,499
No.

297
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:43,713
You know, I didn't want
to mention anything

298
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:45,173
when we looked this place up
in the phone book,

299
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,634
but I just can't imagine
a gun store

300
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:49,094
having leftovers nowadays.

301
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,720
Don't look good, does it?

302
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:53,181
( clattering )

303
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,688
Was it a walker?

304
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,608
Uh, yeah.
It was a walker.

305
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,443
Really?

306
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:09,489
It was a stack of boxes
and a mop,

307
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:10,698
and I tripped.

308
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,867
- ( laughs )
- Still...

309
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:15,036
got what we came for.

310
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,746
You actually found something?

311
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:19,666
Three silencers stashed
in a mini-fridge.

312
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,836
Rule number one
of scavenging--

313
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,879
there's nothing left in this world
that isn't hidden.

314
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,138
We're here.

315
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,806
This was the food bank.

316
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,016
It served the whole county.

317
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,644
All the cans at my church
were gonna end up here.

318
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,963
( splashing )

319
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:11,426
( walkers snarling )

320
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,602
( snarling continues )

321
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:38,536
If a sewer could puke,

322
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,747
this is what it'd smell like.

323
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,882
The water's been coming down
that hole for a while.

324
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:54,761
Slimed this place up good.

325
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,891
Sasha: We can use
the shelves to block them.

326
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,311
Yeah, that's it, Sasha.

327
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:06,439
There's our way.

328
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,108
Down those shelves.

329
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,158
Hey.

330
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:19,327
I said you're coming with us.

331
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:31,005
( snarling )

332
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:33,258
Rick:
Go! Go!

333
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,260
Here they come.

334
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,428
You take right.

335
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:41,849
Rick:
I see three here.

336
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,518
You got it?

337
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,648
We have to get Gabriel.

338
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:33,026
- What happened?
- I don't know.

339
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,153
All right,
we'll push down the shelves

340
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:36,321
on the ones in front of us.

341
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,905
We'll fight through
and I'll grab him.

342
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,574
Go!

343
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:47,999
( snarling )

344
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,315
( whimpering )

345
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,782
Yeah.

346
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,950
I know which way
it's gonna break.

347
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:28,790
Bob!

348
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,209
( snarling )

349
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,634
( grunts )

350
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,681
( panting )

351
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,478
You okay?
Bob, you okay?

352
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:52,647
I'm fine now.

353
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,699
I'm sorry.

354
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,160
I-- I panicked.

355
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:07,328
I told you I--

356
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,622
You knew her when
she was alive?

357
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,338
Yeah, I get it.

358
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,715
You only tell your sins to God.

359
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:29,308
Do you miss the sword?

360
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,269
Wasn't really mine
in the first place.

361
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:35,648
Found it
in the very beginning.

362
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,611
How'd you get so good?

363
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:46,242
It was just me
and them out here

364
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,370
all day, every day

365
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,289
a good long time.

366
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,043
I don't know what that was,
but it wasn't a life.

367
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,672
Not like today.

368
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,134
Stumbling around
in three feet of slime

369
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:06,596
for some peas and carrots,
that's living.

370
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,018
I miss Andrea.

371
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,731
I miss Hershel.

372
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:20,610
- Yeah.
- I don't miss what was before.

373
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,737
I don't miss that sword.

374
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:30,536
Hey.

375
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:32,580
Tyreese said
you were out back.

376
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:35,291
Come on in.
We found food.

377
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:37,460
- A lot of it.
- Good.

378
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,713
What is it?

379
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:43,925
Those scratches.

380
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,551
They're deep.

381
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:48,304
Like knives or something.

382
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,264
Someone was trying to get in.

383
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:56,479
I found something else.

384
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,317
I don't know what happened,
but whatever it is,

385
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:02,985
we can handle it.

386
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,366
Doesn't mean Gabriel
is a bad guy for sure,

387
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:12,119
but it means something.

388
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:31,973
( laughing, chatting )

389
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,061
Ooh, give me-- ah.

390
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,438
I'd like to propose a toast.

391
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,607
( chatter stops )

392
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,236
I look around this room...

393
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,407
and I see survivors.

394
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,995
Each and every one of you

395
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,497
has earned that title.

396
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:02,295
- To the survivors.
- Survivors! Cheers!

397
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,629
( overlapping voices )

398
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:04,839
Cheers.

399
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:06,465
Carol:
Survivors.

400
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,342
Is that all you want to be?

401
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,973
Wake up in the morning,
fight the undead pricks,

402
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:15,141
forage for food,

403
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:16,809
go to sleep at night
with two eyes open,

404
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:18,811
rinse and repeat?

405
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:20,855
'Cause you can do that.

406
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:23,608
I mean, you got the strength.

407
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,735
You got the skill.

408
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,030
Thing is, for you people,

409
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:33,159
for what you can do,
that's just surrender.

410
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:34,660
Now, we get Eugene
to Washington

411
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:36,120
and he will make the dead die

412
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:37,788
and the living will have
this world again.

413
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:41,208
And that is not a bad takeaway
for a little road trip.

414
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,877
( coos )

415
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:44,545
Shh.

416
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:49,383
Eugene, what's in DC?

417
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:55,348
Infrastructure constructed
to withstand pandemics

418
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,184
even of this fubar magnitude.

419
00:32:58,352 --> 00:33:01,729
That means food, fuel, refuge.

420
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,566
Restart.

421
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:11,280
However this plays out,

422
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:13,908
however long it takes
for the reset button to kick in,

423
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:16,827
you can be safe there.

424
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,580
Safer than you've been
since this whole thing started.

425
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:24,919
Come with us.

426
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:27,588
Save the world
for that little one.

427
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,262
Save it for yourselves.

428
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,059
Save it for the people
out there...

429
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:45,439
who don't got nothing left
to do except survive.

430
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:56,283
( chuckles )

431
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,079
- ( coos )
- What was that?

432
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:01,247
( laughter )

433
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:04,125
I think she knows
what I'm about to say.

434
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,794
She's in.
If she's in, I'm in.

435
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,130
- We're in.
- ( all laughing )

436
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,923
- ( clapping )
- Tyreese: Yeah.

437
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:15,136
- Let's do it.
- ( cheering )

438
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,729
Okay.

439
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,980
I'm not letting my brother
be the only one

440
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:27,148
that gets to hold that baby.

441
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,649
( laughs )

442
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,568
Wait.

443
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,321
One more.

444
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,526
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

445
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:16,071
I was at the prison.

446
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,866
With the Governor.

447
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,207
I didn't know who he was

448
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,542
or what he could do.

449
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:32,213
And I didn't know
who all of you were.

450
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:42,890
I-- I just didn't
want it to be hidden.

451
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,517
That I was there.

452
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,733
You're here with us now.

453
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:02,034
( footsteps approaching )

454
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:09,083
Thanks for the hospitality.

455
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:14,755
I'm surprised you let us drink
your communion wine.

456
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:20,010
There isn't anyone left
to take communion.

457
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:25,182
The wine's just wine
until it's blessed.

458
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,358
You're hiding something.

459
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:35,734
And it's pretty obvious

460
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,320
it's something you
can't hide from.

461
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,781
That's your business.

462
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:44,535
But these people,

463
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:48,122
these people are my family.

464
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,625
And if what you're hiding

465
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:55,588
somehow hurts them
in any way,

466
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,131
I'll kill you.

467
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:04,305
( engine idling )

468
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,144
( walker snarling )

469
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:26,285
( rustling )

470
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,083
What are you doing?

471
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,838
I don't know.

472
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,217
Come on.

473
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,386
( car approaching )

474
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,068
Whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

475
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,361
What are you doing?

476
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:03,822
They got Beth.

477
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:07,159
Come on.
Come on, get in.

478
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:10,829
( tires squealing )

479
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:46,365
( sobbing )

480
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,125
( grunts )

481
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:26,613
You waking up?

482
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,450
Ah, you're back with us, huh?

483
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,952
Good news is...

484
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,538
you're not dead yet.

485
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,790
That's a relief, right?

486
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:39,710
But try not to read too much
into the word "yet" there.

487
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,420
It'll just drive you crazy, Bob.

488
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,971
I want to explain myself a little.

489
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:56,143
You see,
we didn't want to hurt you...

490
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,980
before.

491
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,983
We didn't want to pull you
away from your group

492
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:04,359
or scare you.

493
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,905
These aren't things
that we want to do.

494
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,492
They're things we got to do.

495
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:17,331
You and your people
took away our home.

496
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,544
That's fair play.

497
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:26,215
Now we're out here
like everybody else

498
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,175
trying to survive.

499
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:32,513
And in order to do that,

500
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,057
we have to hunt.

501
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,855
Didn't start that way,

502
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:43,524
eating people.

503
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,318
It evolved into that.

504
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:48,195
We evolved.

505
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,531
We had to.

506
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:54,701
And now we've devolved

507
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,537
into hunters.

508
00:40:58,331 --> 00:40:59,832
I told you.

509
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,668
I said it.
Can't go back, Bob.

510
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:09,383
I just hope
you understand

511
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:13,595
that nothing happening
to you now is personal.

512
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:15,848
Yeah, you put us
in this situation,

513
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:19,893
and it is almost
kind of a cosmic justice

514
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:22,479
for it to be you, but...

515
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,525
we would have done this
to anybody.

516
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:31,488
We will.

517
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:36,243
But at the end of the day,

518
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:39,413
no matter how much we hate
all this ugly business...

519
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:47,129
a man's got to eat.

520
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:50,632
( breathing rapidly )

521
00:42:03,897 --> 00:42:05,355
If it makes you feel any better...

522
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:09,610
you taste much better
than we thought you would.

523
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:25,918
( theme music playing )
