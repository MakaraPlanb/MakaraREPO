1
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,981
( shoveling continues )

2
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:31,406
( woman crying )

3
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:38,705
( crying )

4
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:45,128
Gabriel: "We look not
at what can be seen,

5
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,172
but we look at what
cannot be seen.

6
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,134
For what can be seen
is temporary...

7
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,806
but what cannot be seen
is eternal.

8
00:00:56,974 --> 00:01:00,768
For we know that if the earthly tent
we live in is destroyed,

9
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:03,646
we have a building
from God,

10
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,190
a house not made
with hands,

11
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,860
eternal in the heavens."

12
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,533
Noah: She was gonna
come with me.

13
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,957
How far?

14
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:28,337
Outside Richmond,
Virginia.

15
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,798
( Judith crying )

16
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,891
Rick:
It was secure.

17
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:43,060
It has a wall,
homes, 20 people.

18
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,021
Beth wanted to go with him.

19
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:47,899
She wanted to get him there.

20
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:51,235
It's a long trip,
but if it works out,

21
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:54,197
it's the last long trip
we have to make.

22
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,574
And what if it isn't around
anymore?

23
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:00,203
Then we keep going.

24
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,122
Michonne:
Then we find a new place.

25
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:33,444
( shovel scraping dirt )

26
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,582
It's better now.

27
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:11,566
( theme music playing )

28
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,400
How far out?

29
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,529
Five miles.

30
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,949
Hey, Carol.

31
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,659
Carol:
I'm here.

32
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:07,413
We're halfway there.
Just wanted to check the range.

33
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,290
Everybody's holding tight.

34
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,209
We've made it 500 miles.
Maybe this can be the easy part.

35
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,545
Rick:
Got to think we're due.

36
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,964
Give us 20 minutes
to check in.

37
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,175
Carol: We don't hear from you,
we'll come looking.

38
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,177
Rick:
Copy that.

39
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,431
I've been wanting
to tell you something.

40
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:28,351
What's that?

41
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,811
The trade.

42
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,730
It was the right play.

43
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,317
It worked.
It did work.

44
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:40,404
Just something else
happened after.

45
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,865
It went the way it had to.

46
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,368
The way it was always going to.

47
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,623
I never wanted to kill
anybody before.

48
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,668
I've wanted that.

49
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:56,963
But it just made it

50
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,757
so I didn't see anything
except what I wanted.

51
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,884
I wasn't facing it.

52
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,803
Noah:
Facing what?

53
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:07,056
What happened,
what's going on.

54
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:10,142
My dad always
told Sasha and me

55
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,312
that it was our duty
as citizens of the world

56
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,940
to keep up with the news.

57
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,861
When I was little
and I was in his car,

58
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,531
there were always those stories
on the radio.

59
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:28,494
Something happens
1,000 miles away

60
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,747
or down the block.

61
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,043
Some kind of horror I couldn't even
wrap my head around.

62
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,170
But he didn't
change the channel.

63
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,755
He didn't turn it off.

64
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,008
He just kept listening.

65
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,635
To face it.

66
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,221
Keeping your eyes open.

67
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,266
My dad always called that

68
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,143
paying the high cost of living.

69
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,479
I lost my dad in Atlanta.

70
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,940
I think he would
have liked yours.

71
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:03,404
Still got a mom
and a couple of twin brothers.

72
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,409
I hope.

73
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,288
I hope so, too.

74
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,001
Two more miles.

75
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:18,627
All right.

76
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,380
Let's pull into the woods.
We'll go on foot.

77
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,841
Stay off the road.

78
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,135
Noah:
We don't need to.

79
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,513
Just in case.

80
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,287
Rick:
This is good.

81
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,166
Through the trees, it might just look
like part of the wreck.

82
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,001
( snarling, thumping )

83
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,504
( snarling continues )

84
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,883
It's this way.

85
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,243
Your people do this?

86
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,579
Wanted to.
Must have.

87
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,182
Ah!

88
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,227
You all right?

89
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,063
Yeah. Yeah.

90
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,952
They have spotters?
Snipers?

91
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,996
We built a perch on a truck.

92
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,831
Sometimes it's out front.

93
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,381
Not today.

94
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,822
( flies buzzing )

95
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,797
( clangs )

96
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,676
( distant bangs )

97
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,264
Noah:
You hear that?

98
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:21,644
Just wait.

99
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,344
( Noah grunts )

100
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,060
( panting )

101
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,026
Rick:
Noah, hold up.

102
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,367
Noah!

103
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,838
( snarling )

104
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,761
( sobbing )

105
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,948
Come on.
It's all right.

106
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,743
You're gonna be with us now.

107
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,454
( sighs )

108
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,249
( walker snarling )

109
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,087
( sighs )
I'll get him.

110
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:17,634
( sobbing )

111
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,942
I'm sorry, Noah.

112
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,404
I truly am.

113
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,243
We should see if there's anything
we can use and head back.

114
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,953
Then what?

115
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,874
They see us.

116
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,342
We can make a quick sweep.

117
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,804
I'll stay with him.

118
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,772
Carol, you copy?

119
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,649
Carol:
We're here.

120
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,819
We made it.

121
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,656
It's gone.

122
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,662
( snarling )

123
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:36,505
Clean shirt.

124
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,801
- We'll figure it out.
- We will.

125
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,262
There's some garbage bags
in the garage.

126
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,017
You didn't think
it would still be here?

127
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,062
Did you?

128
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,279
After it happened,

129
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:03,198
right after with Beth
in the hospital,

130
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:06,076
I saw that woman Dawn.

131
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:07,870
She didn't mean to do it.

132
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,372
I knew it.
I saw it.

133
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,833
But I wanted to kill her.

134
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,962
I remember I just wondered
if it even mattered

135
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,089
one way or another.

136
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,718
Didn't have a thing
to do with Beth.

137
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:30,434
I don't know if I thought
it would still be here.

138
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:33,395
But Beth wanted to get him here.

139
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,399
She wanted to get him
back home.

140
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,610
This was for her.

141
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,241
And it could have been
for us, too.

142
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:58,587
( crying )

143
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,650
I wanted to die for what I lost.

144
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,443
Who I had lost.

145
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,530
I stepped out into
a crowd of those things

146
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,032
just trying to...

147
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,453
take it all out on them

148
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,789
until they took me.

149
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:36,750
Put them all in front of me
so I didn't see anything.

150
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:39,628
But I just kept going.

151
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,422
And then later,

152
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,968
I was there for Judith
when she needed me.

153
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,428
I saved her.

154
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,139
I brought her back to her dad.

155
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,144
And that wouldn't have happened
if I had just given up...

156
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,983
if I hadn't chosen to live.

157
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,573
Noah.

158
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:11,159
Noah.

159
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,203
This isn't the end.

160
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,004
Hmm?

161
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,675
There you go.

162
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,844
That's right.

163
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,686
Hey, we should--

164
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,272
Noah.

165
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,317
Noah.

166
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,985
Noah!

167
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:52,075
I was thinking about that guy
in the storage container.

168
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,244
Back at Terminus.

169
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,706
How I made us stop.

170
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,088
After the prison,

171
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:08,634
on my trip,
I got Maggie back.

172
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,596
Things went okay.

173
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,352
Losing Washington...

174
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:23,273
losing-- losing Beth

175
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,901
right after just finding out
she's alive...

176
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,326
I hadn't caught up with you yet.

177
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,411
If it were now...

178
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,082
I wouldn't make us stop.

179
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:44,586
We'd run right by.

180
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,758
And I would have
shot that woman dead.

181
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,927
Right or wrong.

182
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,765
Michonne:
We need to stop.

183
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:04,439
You can be out here too long.

184
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,657
Hey, hey.

185
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:17,035
( panting )

186
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,622
This is my house.

187
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:23,417
You don't wanna go in there.

188
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,127
Yes, I do.

189
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,798
Let me see it.

190
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,140
Me first.

191
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,451
( pounds )

192
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:00,203
( pounds )

193
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:04,518
- Noah: I tried to come back sooner.
- ( creaking )

194
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,353
I tried.

195
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:10,565
But I did what you told me to.

196
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:18,490
( snarling, scratching )

197
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,786
( thumping )

198
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:19,968
( snarling )

199
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:23,597
( screams )

200
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,809
( growling )

201
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,443
You're okay. Just hold on.
I'll get them.

202
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:38,445
I'll get-- I'll get them.

203
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:44,659
( door opens, creaks )

204
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:03,011
( radio buzzing,
changing channels )

205
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,601
Man's voice:
At least 68 citizens of the republic

206
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,978
have been killed
in four deadly attacks

207
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:14,689
along the main coastal district.

208
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:20,695
The group has continued
their campaign of random violence,

209
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:23,365
moving across
the countryside unfettered

210
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:27,160
with the republic's
military forces in disarray.

211
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,038
( labored breathing )

212
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:42,384
I tried to tell you.

213
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,345
I tried to tell you, man.

214
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,389
It was gonna be you.

215
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:52,394
You're the kind of guy
who saves babies.

216
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,857
You think Gareth would have
been able to follow you guys

217
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,193
if you'd have just put
a bullet in my brain?

218
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:02,112
Cut me up like your sister did?

219
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,447
Oh, whoa, whoa.
Don't get up.

220
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,908
( breathing heavily )

221
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:11,913
If I hadn't told them
that you were there,

222
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,249
maybe Gareth wouldn't
have gone after you.

223
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:16,584
Maybe they wouldn't be dead.

224
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,586
Maybe Bob wouldn't be dead.

225
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,464
Maybe him being alive,
maybe something about that

226
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,591
would have changed
things with Beth.

227
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,594
Domino shit.
( chuckles )

228
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,764
Maybe not.

229
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:32,976
Maybe you wouldn't
be bit right now.

230
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:35,270
Bob:
Man, that's bullshit.

231
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:38,231
I got bit at the food bank.

232
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:39,733
It went the way it had to,

233
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,610
the way it was always going to.

234
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,654
- Just like this.
- ( static hissing )

235
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,865
Man on radio: ...then terrorizing
the village by night,

236
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,533
carrying out revenge attacks

237
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,119
involving hacking innocents
with machetes

238
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:54,164
and, in some cases,
setting them on fire.

239
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,791
Martin:
If you just did it,

240
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,544
if you didn't lie like a bitch,

241
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,671
it might have changed things.

242
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,174
Maybe the bill
would have been paid.

243
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:07,927
Governor:
The bill has to be paid.

244
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,556
You have to earn your keep.

245
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,101
You told me you'd do
whatever you had to do

246
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:16,686
to earn your keep.

247
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,190
That's what you said.

248
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,692
Hmm?

249
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,903
Remember that?

250
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:28,364
- ( static hissing )
- ( snarling over radio )

251
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,286
Lizzie:
It's better now, Tyreese.

252
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,414
It is.

253
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:37,707
It's better now.

254
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,794
It's not better now.

255
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,378
You know damn well what--

256
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,839
( snarling )

257
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,047
( screams )

258
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,228
( groans )

259
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,730
( breathing heavily )

260
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,926
We could put some of the garage doors
together against the break.

261
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:14,220
Park a car against them
until we can brick it back up.

262
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,141
Michonne:
It can work.

263
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:21,269
This place is surrounded
by a forest.

264
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,313
There's no sight lines.

265
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:27,609
Whoever, whatever
would be on top of us

266
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,153
without us even knowing it.

267
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:31,487
That's probably what happened.

268
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,615
That's what happened to us.

269
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:37,660
We could start
taking down the trees.

270
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:40,121
We use them to build
the walls up.

271
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,500
Look.

272
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,888
It doesn't matter.

273
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,557
What?

274
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:44,352
You said you wondered
if it even mattered

275
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,396
if you killed her or not.

276
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:49,399
It doesn't matter if you had done it

277
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,527
or if I had, or that Daryl did.

278
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,155
It doesn't matter.

279
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:01,786
Michonne:
Washington.

280
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,956
Eugene lied about a cure,

281
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:07,750
but he thought
of Washington for a reason.

282
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,002
But he was lying.

283
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,504
About the cure,
but he did the math

284
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:14,716
and realized that Washington
was the place where there'd be a chance.

285
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:18,052
We're close.

286
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,429
( Rick sighs )

287
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:23,224
What if there are
people there? Huh?

288
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,435
What if it's someplace
that we can be safe?

289
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,520
We're 100 miles away.

290
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:29,397
It's a possibility.

291
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:31,691
It's a chance.

292
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:34,402
Instead of just being out here.

293
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,695
Instead of just making it.

294
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:39,449
Because right now,
this is what making it looks like.

295
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:47,248
Don't you want
one more day with a chance?

296
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:51,753
( snarling )

297
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:54,714
Rick:
We should go.

298
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,428
It's 100 miles away.

299
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:06,434
We should go to Washington.

300
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:12,023
Noah:
Rick!

301
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:15,151
Help! Glenn!
Michonne!

302
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,780
( snarling )

303
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,618
Noah:
Help!

304
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:25,453
Glenn:
Noah, hold on!

305
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:28,664
I got him.

306
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,462
( clangs )

307
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,927
You okay?

308
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:49,602
( grunts )

309
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,146
- It's Tyreese!
- Where?

310
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:54,524
My house.
He's been bit.

311
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:05,201
( buzzing, static hissing )

312
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,287

313
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:11,499
( guitar playing )

314
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:14,377

It's okay, Tyreese.

327

You gotta know that now.

328
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:18,232
It's okay that you didn't wanna
be a part of it anymore, Ty.

329

a part of it.

( Martin laughing )

331
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:29,577
( grunts )

332
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:32,330
See, that's your problem
right there.

333
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:34,540
What's my problem?

334
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:38,169
You didn't want to be part of it,
but being part of it is being now.

335
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,259
That's what it is.

336
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:46,594
Open your eyes.

337
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:50,139
Lizzie: You don't have to.
Not if you don't want to.

338
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:52,016
You don't.

339
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,976
It's better now.

340
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,607
You told me
you'd earn your keep.

341
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:06,989
You had no idea what you were
talking about, did you?

342
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:08,574
Did you?!

343
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:13,454
Your eyes were open,
but you didn't wanna see.

344
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:16,290
Even though I made you see it.

345
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,543
I showed you.

346
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,962
But did you adapt?

347
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,631
Did you change?

348
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,967
No.

349
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:29,136
That you would sit there
in front of a woman

350
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:32,098
who killed someone you loved...

351
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,393
and you would forgive her.

352
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:41,315
That's all there is.

353
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,945
This is all there is.

354
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,489
This is it.

355
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:51,492
( whimpering )

356
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,124
( panting )

357
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:05,214
I didn't know
who I was talking to.

358
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:08,009
I said I would do what I had to
to earn my keep,

359
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,303
but I didn't know you.

360
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,346
But I know--

361
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:15,349
I know who I am.

362
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:19,353
I know what happened
and what's going on.

363
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,773
I know.

364
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,817
You didn't show me shit.

365
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:29,071
You, you're dead.

366
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:32,867
Everything that you were

367
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:35,536
is dead.

368
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:37,830
And it's--

369
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:40,750
it's not over.

370
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:44,211
I forgave her because...

371
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,380
it's not over.

372
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:50,384
( sobbing )
It's not over.

373
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:55,973
It's-- it's not over.

374
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,483
I didn't turn away.

375
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,944
I kept listening to the news

376
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,781
so I could do
what I could to help!

377
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,410
I'm not giving up.

378
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,454
You hear me?

379
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:20,831
I'm not giving up!

380
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,591
People like me--

381
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,721
people like me,
they can live.

382
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,104
Ain't nobody got to die today.

383
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:57,618
You have to pay the bill.

384
00:33:57,786 --> 00:34:00,955
( panting )

385
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,029
- You hold him!
- I got it! Go!

386
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,906
Rick:
One hit, clean! Go!

387
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,037
( panting )

388
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,331
( walkers snarling )

389
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,168
- Push it!
- ( grunts )

390
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,838
- ( walkers snarling )
- Glenn: Let's go! Let's go!

391
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,715
- Let's go!
- Michonne: Through the back.

392
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:54,884
Rick:
We've got to break the chain.

393
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,677
Let's go.

394
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,723
( snarling )

395
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,018
- We can use the bat.
- Noah: I got him.

396
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,479
Can you hold him up?

397
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,481
Yeah.

398
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,691
Rick:
Get ready!

399
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:21,869
( sound fades )

400
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,720
( snarling )

401
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:51,941
One, two, three, now!

402
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,071
Man, if you believe that,

403
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:58,781
then it's definitely
gonna be you and the kid.

404
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:01,116
( gunshot )

405
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,077
( grunting )

406
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:08,666
( Sasha screaming )

407
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:15,548
- No--
- Leave it.

408
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:18,342
Rick: I got him.
Stay with us, now. Stay with us.

409
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:22,429
Governor:
You have to pay the bill!

410
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:25,266
I got you.
Easy now, easy.

411
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:32,606
- On three. One, two, three.
- ( all grunt )

412
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:34,024
Michonne: What?
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

413
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,985
- Rick: Come on!
- Noah: Come on.

414
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,778
Glenn:
Open them!

415
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:41,240
Noah: Come on, man.
Open your eyes. Open your eyes!

416
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:42,449
( all yell )

417
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,869
Beth:

00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:49,748

♪ And together we fight

421
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,882
You got to hold on, man.
Hold on!

00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,175
- Glenn: His feet! Get his feet.
- Rick: Two, three...

423
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,760
- ( all grunt )
- Rick: Let's go!

424
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:06,473

Come on, give him to me.

430
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,739
- Bring him in.
- I got him.

431
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:24,825
( all grunting )

432
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:27,828
- Rick: Hold him up. Hold him up.
- You're all right. You're all right.

433
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,582
Carol, we're at the car.

434
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,126
We need to cauterize
the arm and wrap it.

435
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:36,128
Get Sasha and Carl away.

436
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:38,005
- They don't need to see this.
- ( engine starts )

437
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,928
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

438
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,649
( snarling )

439
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:01,862
Noah:
Come on. Come on!

440
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:19,129
Man on radio: There have been
troubling reports of cannibalism

441
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,173
having broken out
in refugee camps

442
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:23,842
along the republic's
transportation corridor.

443
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,845
And despite the string
of victories by rebel forces,

444
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,889
there are disturbing reports
of increasing

445
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:31,225
the brutality of their tactics

446
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:34,144
including the wholesale
destruction of villages,

447
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,813
burning down local prisons,

448
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:38,649
targeting of civilians,
and even the widespread

449
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:41,485
mutilation of children
and young mothers.

450
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,237
And this seems like
only the beginning

451
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:46,907
of their campaign that they label
as an endless war against...

452
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:49,159
Turn it off.

453
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:53,998
You sure?

454
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:00,879
It's okay, Tyreese.

455
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,673
You gotta know that now.

456
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:08,220
It isn't just okay.

457
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:10,264
It's better now.

458
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,087
"We look not
at what can be seen,

459
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:08,465
but we look at what
cannot be seen.

460
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:12,219
For what can be seen
is temporary,

461
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:16,390
but what cannot
be seen is eternal.

462
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:23,647
For we know that if the earthly tent
we live in is destroyed,

463
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:26,900
we have a building from God,

464
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:30,821
a house not made from hands,

465
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:34,074
eternal in the heavens.

466
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:39,872
In the heavens."

467
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:14,239
( shoveling continues )

468
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:26,043
( shoveling continues )
