1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,004
( birds chirping )

2
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:04,749
( theme music playing )

3
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,706
( revs motor )

4
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,547
Reg: Sorry I'm late.
The power's out again.

5
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:58,177
How is it that you called
this extremely early morning meeting,

6
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:01,347
yet I'm the one
bringing breakfast?

7
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,767
'Cause you're a good guy.

8
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,979
The evidence seems to go
in that direction.

9
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,438
What's up?

10
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,986
Can we start meeting
in the mornings?

11
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:19,657
So I can bring you steel-cut oatmeal
and ask you why we're meeting?

12
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,493
So you can teach me
how to build things.

13
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,873
You want to be an architect?

14
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,916
I want to make sure
those walls stay up.

15
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:32,378
Do you think they could fall?

16
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:37,508
I think they could
get knocked in.

17
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:40,344
Could be years from now,
could be when I'm your age.

18
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,512
( chuckles )

19
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,223
I'll still be around
when you're my age.

20
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:48,394
Well, it wouldn't hurt if I knew
some of what you knew.

21
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,148
For the walls, the houses.

22
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,235
Some new buildings.

23
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:00,615
So you're in it
for the long haul?

24
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,951
Yeah.

25
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,175
What are you writing?

26
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:22,470
Oh, I write everything down.

27
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:24,555
Everything of note.

28
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,782
Now you should.

29
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,287
There's gonna be
a lot to remember.

30
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,790
This is the beginning
of this place.

31
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,335
You should record all that.

32
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,881
Along with everything
I'm gonna teach you

33
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,758
about building things.

34
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,331
( turns off water )

35
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,421
- Oh, no, thank you.
- Nicholas: Just take it.

36
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,882
- Come on, you got to protect yourself.
- Not if I don't go.

37
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,845
We're not driving all that way so we can
just drive back with the wrong shit.

38
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,013
It's a dozen of these.

39
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,016
They are consistent in appearance
across manufacturers.

40
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,268
Okay?
The shit will be right.

41
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:55,354
I will install said shit.

42
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,773
Then the grid will be
fully operational again.

43
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:07,491
Heard you talking to Holly last night.
What's her story?

44
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,326
Why do you ask?

45
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,871
- No reason.
- Mm-hmm.

46
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,498
It's an innocent question.
Don't make me hurt you.

47
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,875
Reg:
You got everything?

48
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,210
First aid kits, yellow pages.

49
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,879
Glenn made a checklist.
We're good, I swear.

50
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,714
I know.
I'm just a worrier.

51
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:25,217
That's how that wall
wound up around us.

52
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,386
Love you.

53
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,055
Take care, Dad.

54
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,348
I'm supposed to be
saying that to you.

55
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,560
That's everything?

56
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,687
- All right.
- All set?

57
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,981
- Mm-hmm.
- You got this.

58
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,525
You always do.

59
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,360
Yeah.

60
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,033
Power grid was a prototype.

61
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:51,786
I'm surprised it took this long
to start acting up.

62
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,829
We'll get it going.

63
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,956
Daylight's burning.
Let's go.

64
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:04,840
I know I said it before,
but thank you.

65
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,385
Yeah.

66
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,140
( door closes )

67
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,102
( engine starts )

68
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,771
Tara: So, seriously, though,
what's her story?

69
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,856
( loud dance music playing )

70
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,109
Great, another mix.

71
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,571
♪ Now you're going to die. ♪

72
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,657
Helps draw them away.

73
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:53,389
( sighs )

74
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:57,059
- Hey.
- Hey.

75
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,728
- What happened?
- I don't know.

76
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,814
Maybe somebody
doesn't like owls?

77
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:06,610
Someone came in here
and did this?

78
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,445
Yeah.

79
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,500
Stuff like this
never happens here.

80
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,460
( sighs )

81
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,422
Well, you got any enemies?

82
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,510
You know anybody
who hates owls?

83
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,512
( laughs )

84
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,184
Well, too bad there isn't somebody
who could look into this kind of thing.

85
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,604
I'll ask around.

86
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,690
- No, you don't have to.
- Yeah, I know.

87
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,445
Okay, so you find the person
who did this and then what?

88
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:51,697
Some kind of consequences.

89
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:55,242
You ever heard about
the broken window theory?

90
00:08:56,828 --> 00:09:00,080
Boils down to this--
you keep the windows intact,

91
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,082
you keep society intact.

92
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,629
This was an owl, Rick.

93
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,465
Yeah. Yeah.

94
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,717
I got to do something today.

95
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,975
- Tara: That's it there?
- That's the warehouse.

96
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,436
Looks like that door
is our fastest way in and out.

97
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,605
We should know all the exits first.

98
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:27,733
- So there's a plan if things go south.
- Nicholas: Already got one.

99
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,443
It's called going out the front.

100
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,697
- Tara: Noah, heads up.
- ( walker snarling )

101
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,366
Noah:
Got it.

102
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,244
( silenced gunshot )

103
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,248
Look at you with the aim.

104
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,712
Glenn's right, we should do
a perimeter check.

105
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,881
Know our exits just in case.

106
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,144
( snarling )

107
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:13,737
So you're aware, I'm on record
as stating that I should not be here.

108
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,656
You well know
that I'm not combat ready

109
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,950
or even for that matter
combat inclined.

110
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,286
You never are till you are.

111
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,537
But you got to start
pulling your weight.

112
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,080
You know, I did.

113
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,501
What?

114
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,087
All things being equal,
I do believe my weight's been pulled.

115
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,464
I got you all to DC, which,
in this man's opinion,

116
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,134
is damn near nirvana
by current standards.

117
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,261
Except you didn't get us here.

118
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:40,347
We got you here.

119
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,224
But were it not for me
and my mention

120
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,310
of this city's potential
for home and hearth,

121
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,312
not a one of you would have had
the vision to come here,

122
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:50,774
let alone the cojones to travail
such a fraught and punishing pilgrimage.

123
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,818
And that, sister, is a fact.

124
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,404
That's as cold and hard
as they come.

125
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:59,366
God, you're really
that much of a coward?

126
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:02,703
Yes, I am.
I told you I was.

127
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:14,757
It was good aim back there.

128
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,842
Target practice helped.

129
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,056
Actually, last week, I was pretty close
to practicing on Aiden.

130
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,641
( laughs )
Me, too, man.

131
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,272
( walkers snarling )

132
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,241
Glenn:
Well, we're not getting out the front.

133
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,212
( bangs )

134
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:58,050
Give it another second.

135
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,137
It's a big place.

136
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,223
There could be some inside.

137
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,726
So let's say they are.

138
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,271
Let's move.
Let's be safe.

139
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,316
All right.

140
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,246
( door closes )

141
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,373
Okay, let's move.

142
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,263
- Tara.
- Yeah?

143
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,598
- You got it?
- I got this aisle.

144
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,609
( distant metal clanks )

145
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,285
( metal cage rattles )

146
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,328
Shh.

147
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,498
- ( metal cage rattles )
- ( walkers snarling )

148
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,295
They're stuck
behind something.

149
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,464
How do you know?

150
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,466
I don't.

151
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,634
But they aren't here.

152
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,638
All right.
Hey, let's go.

153
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,602
Eyes up.

154
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,812
( snarling continues )

155
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,153
( snarling )

156
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,006
- Glenn: Clear.
- Clear.

157
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,508
You know your stuff.

158
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,009
Tara:
We were out there a long time.

159
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,094
Glenn:
There could be more.

160
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,222
Aiden:
Let's get to work.

161
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,808
You're up.

162
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,197
This one here.

163
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,133
- Yeah.
- We found 'em.

164
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,597
- Here's another one.
- All right, Eugene.

165
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:53,725
( walkers snarling )

166
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,400
( snarling )

167
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,117
( gunshot )

168
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,413
( gunshots )

169
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,458
It's got armor.
Let it come closer.

170
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,876
I got it.

171
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,796
( gunshots )

172
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,216
Aiden, stop!

173
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,384
Stop!

174
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:36,643
( groans, coughs )

175
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,814
( all coughing )

176
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,737
( groans )

177
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,200
( coughs )

178
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,286
Oh, God.

179
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:57,914
Oh, God.

180
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:06,298
( Nicholas groans )
He's dead.

181
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:10,302
( walkers snarling )

182
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,973
Noah? Tara?
Eugene?

183
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,313
- You good?
- Yeah.

184
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,525
Cage is open.
They're getting out.

185
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,694
- We need to find--
- Eugene: Here.

186
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,657
Over here.

187
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,169
Is she breathing?
Eugene!

188
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,171
Eugene:
I-- I can't tell from right here.

189
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,174
- ( snarling continues )
- Nicholas: They're getting close.

190
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,051
Eugene:
Walker.

191
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,889
- Eugene: Walker.
- ( snarling )

192
00:16:57,225 --> 00:17:00,185
Eugene, it's yours.
Take it out.

193
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,360
( snarling )

194
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,038
( gunshot )

195
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,044
Get to that office.
I'll get Tara. Go!

196
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,632
( rustling, cans rattling )

197
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,436
What are you doing here?

198
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,855
I didn't tell anybody
about the guns.

199
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,232
- I swear to God.
- Answer my question.

200
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,193
Do you have
any more cookies?

201
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:51,611
The ones you made
for the party?

202
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,947
They're gone.
Now go. Go home.

203
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,741
My house doesn't have power.

204
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,244
I was going to paint my owl statue,
but somebody broke it.

205
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,248
None of these are problems, Sam.

206
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,293
I don't care about your house.
I don't care about your statue.

207
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,003
Now get out.

208
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:10,088
- Can you make more cookies?
- No.

209
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,008
- Why not?
- Because I don't want to.

210
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:15,218
Maybe if you showed me
how to make them,

211
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,471
I could do it myself.

212
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,350
You want cookies?

213
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:26,271
All right, you're gonna have to steal
the chocolate from Olivia.

214
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,065
And then you're gonna get
an extra bar for me.

215
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,067
And if you get caught
or you say anything,

216
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,569
you're not gonna like
what happens to you.

217
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,279
Now go.

218
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,450
( walkers snarling )

219
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,452
- How's she doing?
- She has serious head trauma.

220
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,954
- She's losing blood fast.
- How do we stop it?

221
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,415
Med kit was in Aiden's pack.
It got blown to hell.

222
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,583
Glenn:
There's another one in the van.

223
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:49,127
She's on her way out.
We need to get her there.

224
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,545
Glenn: All right,
we'll get her there.

225
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,464
Aiden:
Help! Somebody!

226
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,466
Nicholas:
Oh, Jesus.

227
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,092
- ( groans )
- Glenn: He's alive?

228
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,178
Nicholas: I checked him.
I-- I thought--

229
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,222
- We've got to get him.
- Oh, Jesus.

230
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,807
It's gonna take
at least three of us.

231
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,600
We got that kind of time?

232
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,644
We pull Aiden off there,
we could kill him.

233
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,438
- So you're saying we leave him?
- Go, save him.

234
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,398
She'd do it.
I know she would.

235
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,902
I'll stay with her.
I'll keep her safe, I assure you.

236
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,570
I will.

237
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,156
All right,
we'll knock 'em back.

238
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,616
- You still have that flare?
- Yeah.

239
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,743
You fire the flare
over the shelves.

240
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,245
That'll draw some of them over.

241
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,413
All right, we're gonna hit
the rest hand to hand.

242
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,332
- You ready?
- Yeah.

243
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,085
One, two, three.
( grunts )

244
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,174
Come on!

245
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,028
Tobin really think
this'll take four weeks?

246
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,447
That's what he said.

247
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,200
First time they expanded the wall,
it took 'em twice that.

248
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,915
Hey, uh, you okay to hang tight?

249
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,293
I need to send a fax
to Cleveland.

250
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:26,474
( birds screeching )

251
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,742
( heart beating )

252
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:05,513
- ( gunshots )
- ( woman echoes ) Roamers!

253
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,098
Bruce:
Hey! Hey! Hey!

254
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,100
( walkers snarling )

255
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,312
- ( panting )
- ( gunshots )

256
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,744
Ah!

257
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,543
Everybody,
back till we're safe in the truck.

258
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,172
What about Francine?

259
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:42,842
Damn it!

260
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,640
Abraham!

261
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,642
Come on.

262
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,189
Up and in.
You first.

263
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:05,448
( chuckles )
Mother dick.

264
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,342
- Abraham.
- Heads up.

265
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,386
You take out the ass end.

266
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:27,887
I got the uglies in the front.

267
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,348
That's it.
Single file.

268
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:31,599
There we go.
Come on.

269
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,518
Don't be shy.
Come on!

270
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,395
Mother dick!

271
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,523
( Abraham grunting )

272
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,110
Hell, son of a bitch
is still alive.

273
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,821
- What are you doing?
- Abraham: Come on!

274
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:46,406
Making sure he stays that way.

275
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:48,283
( gunshots )

276
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,247
Hey, Rick,
just having a beer.

277
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,708
Thought I'd bring you one
for helping my wife today.

278
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,461
Um, I'm good, but thanks.

279
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,088
Come on, don't tell me
you're still on duty.

280
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:05,383
Kind of always am,
you know?

281
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:08,553
Well, not at Deanna's party.

282
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,263
I saw you.

283
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,602
You had some, right?

284
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:20,315
You know, I wish I could
have helped out more today.

285
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:23,943
I asked around, but nobody
saw or heard anything.

286
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:27,781
Well, it was just an owl.

287
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,075
Grand scheme of things,
I think we'll live.

288
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,329
Yeah.

289
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:39,042
I'm sorry.

290
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,586
Heard you lost your wife.

291
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,347
You know...

292
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:56,559
I'm sure it looks like
we haven't lost much,

293
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:58,269
but we have.

294
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,438
We've lost things.

295
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,775
Other things we're just
fighting like hell to hold on to.

296
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,611
Everything you people
have been through,

297
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,446
I don't know if you see that.

298
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:12,117
We do.

299
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,290
Bring your kids in
for a checkup.

300
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,876
I know I offered you one,
but they really should come in.

301
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:23,962
They were out there
a while, right?

302
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,965
Yeah.
Thanks, Pete.

303
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:33,847
Let's be friends, man.

304
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,015
We kind of have to be, right?

305
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:39,018
Yeah, we do.

306
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,854
So we will.

307
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,066
I'll see you, Rick.

308
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,627
Eugene:
I take no responsibility for this.

309
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,589
I told you what I was.

310
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,467
You should've listened.

311
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,970
All of you,
you should've listened.

312
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,390
( walkers snarling )

313
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,692

( groaning )

319
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,520
Hey, it's gonna be okay.
We're gonna get you out of here.

320
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,648
All right?
Everything's gonna be okay.

321
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,901
I need you to stay quiet, okay?
Can you do that?

322
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,028
Okay.

323
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:13,529
All right.

324
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,867
One, two, three.

325
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,494
- ( screams )
- Noah: The flare.

326
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:21,371
It's burning out.

327
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:24,123
( whimpering )

328
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,667
Come on.
Come on, again.

329
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,920
- We're not gonna make this.
- Hey, yes, we are.

330
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,880
But I need your help.
You can do this.

331
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:33,716
Nick. Nick, don't--
don't leave me.

332
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:38,263
- Okay. Okay. Okay.
- Glenn: Okay. Three!

333
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,557
- ( gunshots )
- ( groaning )

334
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:55,363
You left them.
We both did.

335
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,282
That's who we are.

336
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,034
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

337
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:02,787
I'm sorry.

338
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,956
Noah:
They're coming.

339
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:08,126
( Aiden screaming )

340
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:13,548
Okay, it was-- it was us.

341
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:15,550
The others before.

342
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:18,720
They didn't panic.
We did.

343
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,388
It was us.

344
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:24,642
No.

345
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,394

They're here!

349
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,007
That how it works with you?

350
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:58,134
You leave people behind to die?

351
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:00,762
We have a system.
Tell him, Francine.

352
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,347
- We have a--
- ( grunts )

353
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:05,683
Asshole.

354
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:10,313
Hey, all that noise
is bound to draw more.

355
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:12,357
I say we call it and start fresh
in the morning, all right?

356
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,692
Screw that.
Francine, you good?

357
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:18,780
Got at least three hours
of daylight left.

358
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,201
I want two lookouts.

359
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,995
One in the bucket
and one on the trucks.

360
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:27,330
Should give us
more than enough warning

361
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:29,499
if more are coming
after the bash and pop.

362
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,378
Now pull the cobwebs
out of your ass and move.

363
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,423
We got a wall to build.

364
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:45,681
- Glenn: Nicholas, stop!
- ( walkers snarling )

365
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:49,227
Hey!
You'll never make it.

366
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,271
Noah:
Heads up.

367
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:58,694
- ( gun clicking )
- I'm out!

368
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,405
Let's go!
Come on!

369
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,754
Sorry to lose you, Tobin.

370
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:19,173
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

371
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:24,262
If Abraham had followed
my orders, she'd be dead.

372
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:27,223
Yeah, well, saving someone's life
makes them a hero,

373
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:31,227
but it doesn't qualify them
to run a construction crew.

374
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:33,938
Well, they're still out there,

375
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,941
still working,
the whole team.

376
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:40,528
And he's leading them.

377
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,990
Better than I ever could.

378
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,958
I guess it's settled, then.

379
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,798
I'll speak to Abraham when he's back
and make it official.

380
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,842
Yeah.

381
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:06,804
Thank you, Deanna.

382
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:10,641
And the thing is,

383
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,935
I know you won't regret it.

384
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,629
He's right, you know?

385
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:42,089
Abraham's more than qualified.

386
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,843
( chuckles )

387
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:48,596
I put another one
of your people

388
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:52,183
in a position of power,
you vouch for them.

389
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:55,520
It's becoming a pattern.

390
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,313
Maggie:
We know what we're doing.

391
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:00,483
It's why you wanted us here.

392
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:05,696
It's why Aaron and Daryl
are out there looking for more people.

393
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,823
You wanted a future.

394
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,244
You need us for that.

395
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,163
That's right.

396
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,376
I'll go get back to work
on those field plans.

397
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,754
- I'll be down in a minute.
- Okay.

398
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,300
( knocking )

399
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,438
After these are done, that's it.

400
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,399
I'm not helping you again
and you're not coming back.

401
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,401
- You got it?
- Uh-huh.

402
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,903
I hope you're not expecting to leave
with more than half of these.

403
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:48,072
You barely did half the work.

404
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:52,868
Were you always a good cook?

405
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,081
Sam, we're not talking.

406
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:01,002
( runs water )

407
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,254
Wipe the counter.

408
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,423
( sighs )

409
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:09,010
Did you like it?
Cooking?

410
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,636
You know, before.

411
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,638
Sam.

412
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,392
We don't have to be friends.

413
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,686
Just doesn't have to be quiet.

414
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,442
I was good at it.
It distracted me.

415
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,819
It made me forget
when I was sad.

416
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:30,114
Sometimes when I get sad,
I break stuff.

417
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,783
What kind of stuff?

418
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,832
You said somebody
broke your owl statue.

419
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,667
Did you break it?

420
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,759
Why?

421
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,927
Why are you here?

422
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,807
Why did you steal the guns?

423
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:02,104
Because sometimes you need
to protect yourself.

424
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,487
Can I have a gun?

425
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:12,865
Why do you want one?

426
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,078
It's not for me.

427
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,665
Who's it for?

428
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:26,003
Sam, who's it for?

429
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:36,013
- Sam.
- ( door opens, closes )

430
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,432
( snarling )

431
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:47,024
Hey, maybe-- maybe we can
shoot our way past them.

432
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:50,194
- You guys still have guns.
- And you have the ammo.

433
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,363
We've got to do
something, man.

434
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,240
We're gonna die in here.

435
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,453
There has to be another way.
There has to be a way.

436
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:05,126
- ( dance music blaring )
- ( horn honks )

437
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,753
- Hey! Hey! Over here.
- ( banging )

438
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:11,549
- Come get me. Come get me.
- ( horn honks )

439
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:14,051
Come on.
Come on.

440
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:18,389
- Come and get me.
- ( honking, banging )

441
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,566
Come on, Eugene.
Yeah.

442
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,246
All right. Hey.

443
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:44,749
I need you both--
hey, Nicholas!

444
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,752
I need you both to keep
the door steady, all right?

445
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,588
I'm gonna break the glass.

446
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:52,923
We get out, you push out.

447
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,383
We get the rifle and we're good.

448
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:55,926
All right?
All right?

449
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,595
Ready?

450
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:06,270
No! No, stop!
It's not safe!

451
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,439
- Glenn: This is the only way.
- No, it's not gonna break.

452
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:10,733
It will, okay?
We can hold it.

453
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:12,443
We can.

454
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,570
Trust me, okay?
Count of three.

455
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:17,907
Count of three.
One, two--

456
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,867
- Nicholas: No!
- Hey! Hey!

457
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:22,119
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

458
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:25,080
Nicholas!
Nicholas, don't! Nicholas!

459
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:28,250
- Damn it, Nicholas, no!
- Nicholas!

460
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:33,631
- Don't!
- No.

461
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:36,050
Hey, Nicholas, don't do it!

462
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:38,093
No, no!

463
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,513
- No!
- Don't let go.

464
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,474
( both scream )

465
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:46,727
Noah! Noah! Noah!

466
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:49,605
No!

467
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:56,612
( screaming )

468
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:15,506
( screaming stops )

469
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,675
( snarling, tearing )

470
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,358
Hey! Hey!

471
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:36,610
Move over.
We're leaving.

472
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,198
( shuts off engine )

473
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:42,741
Get back in the van.

474
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,785
Not until you tell me
where they are.

475
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,664
Either you
come back with me

476
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:50,374
or you stay here
and you die with your friends.

477
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,376
Those are your choices.

478
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,897
( breathing heavily )

479
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,488
( voice breaking )
Help me get him in the back.

480
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,198
Where's Noah?

481
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:30,581
( knocking )

482
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,839
( knocks )

483
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,346
Hi. Carol, right?

484
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,681
That's right.

485
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,975
Do you need something?

486
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:51,602
Not feeling well?

487
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,563
I was with Sam earlier.
Is he okay?

488
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:58,442
Why wouldn't he be?

489
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,864
Can I talk to Jessie?

490
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,824
Not a good time.

491
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,119
Pete, don't.

492
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,490
Gabriel, what is it?

493
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,617
- I need to speak with you.
- Come-- come in.

494
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:50,995
- Privately.
- All right.

495
00:38:58,128 --> 00:39:00,212
Satan...

496
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,507
he disguises himself
as the angel of light.

497
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:09,138
I'm afraid that false light is here
inside these walls.

498
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:11,724
Your community,

499
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:15,978
you say it's not a paradise,
but it is.

500
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:19,523
I'm grateful to be here.
I am.

501
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:23,944
But you made a mistake
letting in the others.

502
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:25,863
How so?

503
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,116
Rick...

504
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,077
his group...

505
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,374
they're not good people.

506
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:40,377
They've done things.

507
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:43,672
They've done
unspeakable things.

508
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,591
( door opens )

509
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:53,223
Pete's hitting Jessie.

510
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:56,727
Maybe Sam, too.

511
00:39:58,772 --> 00:40:01,273
Deanna: To make it out there
as long as they did,

512
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:02,983
they must have done things.

513
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:05,444
Rick said as much.

514
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:07,821
They survived.

515
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,573
That's what makes them assets.

516
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:12,367
You're wrong.

517
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,870
They can't be trusted.

518
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:17,623
They're dangerous.

519
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:20,250
You may believe that they did
what they had to do,

520
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,712
that they were afraid
and so they--

521
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,756
Listen up!

522
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:28,425
- Gabriel: The day will come...
- We made a damn good dent today.

523
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:31,929
...when they'll put their own lives
before yours and everyone else's

524
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:35,432
and they will destroy
everything you have here,

525
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,726
everything you're working
so hard to build.

526
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:39,269
I suggest you all call it
an early night.

527
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,522
You know this how?

528
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,857
Sam tell you?

529
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,319
He didn't have to.

530
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:51,281
Deanna: Why are you just now
coming to me with this?

531
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,742
Satan,

532
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:58,705
he disguises himself
as the angel of light.

533
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,834
His servants are the false apostles
of righteousness.

534
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:05,129
They don't deserve this.
They don't deserve paradise.

535
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:11,802
Thank you, Gabriel.

536
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,639
I have a lot to think about.

537
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:20,018
I--

538
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,315
I only wish I had come
to you sooner.

539
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,317
I just--

540
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,698
I hope it isn't too late.

541
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:39,079
( door closes )

542
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:46,170
( van approaches )

543
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:49,339
- ( door opens )
- Glenn: Help! I need help!

544
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,466
( sighs )

545
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:55,179
Carol:
Rick.

546
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:59,183
I know how this
is gonna go with Pete.

547
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:03,979
There's only one way it can go.

548
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:14,323
You're gonna have to kill him.

549
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:24,625
