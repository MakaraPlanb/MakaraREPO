1
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:07,382
( woman screaming )

2
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:12,845
( whimpering )

3
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,973
Alex: We should've never
put up the signs.

4
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:18,518
What the hell did we think
was gonna happen?

5
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,859
We brought them here.

6
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,533
We were trying
to do something good.

7
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:37,120
- ( laughs )
- We were being human beings.

8
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:40,039
What are we now, Gareth?

9
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,875
( woman screaming )

10
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:57,974
( radio chatter )

11
00:00:58,142 --> 00:01:01,269
Abraham: They seemed nice enough,
but I was ready to go.

12
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:04,397
We just got here,
but, damn,

13
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,315
it was time to go.

14
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,609
When I told them about DC,

15
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,237
a wink and a nod from
the head asshole in charge,

16
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,905
they pulled their guns
and it was right back

17
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,242
to our regularly scheduled
shitstorm.

18
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,912
Sasha: Before they put you in here,
you didn't see Tyreese?

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,081
- Michonne: No.
- Sasha: Good.

20
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,584
Daryl: Black car with a white cross
painted on it.

21
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:27,086
I tried to follow it.
I tried.

22
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,755
Maggie:
But she's alive?

23
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,465
Daryl:
She's alive.

24
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,095
( radio chatter continues )

25
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:44,103
( men chatting )

26
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,606
- Man: What are you doing?
- Man #2: Everybody shut up.

27
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:48,232
Shut up!

28
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,611
All right, got four of them pricks
coming our way.

29
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,616
Y'all know what to do.

30
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,534
Go for their eyes first.

31
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,036
Then their throats.

32
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,584
Man: Put your backs to the walls
on either end of the car now!

33
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,299
( clanging )

34
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,180
Move!

35
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:22,683
( all coughing )

36
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:26,103
( doors opening )

37
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,982
( gas mask hissing )

38
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,862
- Man: Move!
- Man #2: Get up!

39
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,031
( grunts )

40
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:43,412
( distorted voice, indistinct )

41
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:49,001
( saw buzzing )

42
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,296
Okay, hold up.

43
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,990
All right.

44
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,792
( whimpering )

45
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:21,010
( muffled screaming )

46
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,864
- ( knife slices )
- ( blood pouring )

47
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,241
( man, muffled )
Please, no! No!

48
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:03,344
Hey, guys.
What were your shot counts?

49
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,846
- 38.
- ( thuds )

50
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,149
Gareth:
Hey!

51
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,402
Your shot count?

52
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,782
Crap, man, I'm sorry.

53
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,325
It was my first roundup.

54
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,202
Gareth: After you're done here,
go back to your point

55
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,745
and count the shells.

56
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,664
Kaylee won't be gathering them
until tomorrow.

57
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,374
( Bob, muffled )
Hey.

58
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,543
Hey, let me talk to you.

59
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,505
Four from A, four from D?

60
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:40,756
Man:
Yeah.

61
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,050
Hey, let me talk
to you for a minute.

62
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,011
Let me talk to you
for a minute.

63
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,138
- Let me talk to you for a minute.
- What?

64
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,390
Don't do this.
We can fix this.

65
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,851
- No, you can't.
- You don't have to do this.

66
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,020
We told you there's a way
out of all of this.

67
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,356
You just have to take a chance.

68
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,235
We have a man
who knows how to stop it.

69
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:02,403
He has a cure.

70
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,697
We just have to get him
to Washington.

71
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,449
You don't have to do this, man.

72
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,743
We can put the world
back to how it was.

73
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,871
Can't go back, Bob.

74
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,123
We can!
You don't have to do--

75
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,806
We saw you go
into the woods with a bag

76
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,933
and come out without it.

77
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,686
Had to pull my spotters back
before we could go look for it.

78
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:38,272
What was in it?

79
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,235
You hid it, right?

80
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,780
In case things went bad?

81
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,034
Smart.

82
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,744
Still, we'll find it.

83
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,080
But it's too dangerous
to go out there right now.

84
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,840
What was in it?

85
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,675
I'm curious.

86
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:10,763
And it was a big bag.

87
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,685
You really gonna let me do this?

88
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,771
Well, let me take you out there.

89
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:21,273
I'll show you.

90
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,818
Not gonna happen,
but this might.

91
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,945
Rick:
There's guns in it.

92
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,949
AK-47.

93
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,992
.44 Magnum.

94
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,663
Automatic weapons.
Nightscope.

95
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:38,916
There's a compound bow

96
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:42,419
and a machete
with a red handle.

97
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,258
That's what I'm gonna use
to kill you.

98
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:52,930
( chuckles )

99
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,100
( sighs )

100
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:58,644
Thanks.

101
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,897
You have two hours
to get them on the driers.

102
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,315
Then we go back to public face.

103
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,775
Now's the time
we can get messy,

104
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,986
but we need to dial it all in
by sundown.

105
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,988
- Got it.
- Yes, sir.

106
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,866
( gunshots )

107
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:15,995
Hey, Chuck?

108
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,998
( gunshot )

109
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,044
( explosion )

110
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,047
( theme music playing )

111
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,216
We're close.

112
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,761
I'm gonna get you both there,
make sure you're safe.

113
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,721
( Judith coos )

114
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,890
But I'm not gonna stay.

115
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,275
( raspy breathing )

116
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,949
( snarling )

117
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,331
( crying )

118
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,085
I can't. Not yet.

119
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,672
You're going to have
to be able to.

120
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,932
( snarling )

121
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:05,980
( whispers )
More.

122
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:25,124
( snarling )

123
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:43,100
( gunshots )

124
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:02,286
( gunshots continue )

125
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,394
That gunfire,

126
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,480
it could have been
from Terminus.

127
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,149
Someone was attacking them.

128
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,943
Or they were attacking someone.

129
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,446
Do we even want to find out?

130
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:41,909
Yeah.

131
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:43,744
There's another track due east.

132
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,622
It'll get us there.
We'll be real careful.

133
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,917
We're gonna get answers.

134
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:02,930
Woman on radio:
10-minute count.

135
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:04,973
You screw up,
you're on your own, Martin.

136
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:10,312
You don't have to tell me.
I wipe my own ass.

137
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:15,567
Alex didn't get it.

138
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,445
See, I knew the chick
with the sword was bad news.

139
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,781
Bitch looked like a weapon
with a weapon.

140
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,868
He was always
a sloppy-ass mother.

141
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:27,830
Yeah, I told Albert I want the kid's hat
after they bleed him out.

142
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,125
Keep your finger
off the button and drop it.

143
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,292
( radio clatters )

144
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,919
They're only doing eight
before public face.

145
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,422
- Don't wait on 'em.
- Listen, y'all don't have to do this.

146
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,549
Whatever you want, we got a place
where everyone's welcome.

147
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,217
- Shut up, man.
- Okay.

148
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:41,969
We're friends
of the chick with the sword

149
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,929
and the kid in the hat.

150
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,101
They attacked us.
We're just holding them.

151
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,769
I don't believe you.

152
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,105
Who else do you have?
Do you know their names?

153
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,982
We just have the boy
and the samurai, that's it.

154
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,067
We were just protecting ourselves.

155
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,153
I don't believe you.

156
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,114
There's a bunch of us out there
in six different directions.

157
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,991
There was a lot of gunfire
back home.

158
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,617
We need to set off our charges
all at the same time

159
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,785
to confuse the dead ones away.

160
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,455
- That's good for you, too.
- No, it isn't.

161
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,624
There's a herd heading
toward Terminus right now.

162
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,918
We don't want
to confuse them away.

163
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,753
We're gonna need their help.

164
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,755
It's a compound.

165
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,008
They'll see you coming.

166
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:24,887
If you even make it that far
with all the cold bodies heading over.

167
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,638
Carol.

168
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,599
How are you gonna do this?

169
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,603
I'm gonna kill people.

170
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,492
( flies buzzing )

171
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,515
She got a name?

172
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:16,146
Hey, she got a name?

173
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,066
Judith.

174
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:21,193
She your daughter or something?

175
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,278
She's a friend.

176
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,197
Huh.

177
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,868
( sighs )

178
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,537
I don't have any friends.

179
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,038
I mean, I know people.

180
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,457
They're just assholes
I stay alive with.

181
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,545
The other one your friend?
The woman?

182
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,347
I used to have 'em.

183
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,600
Used to watch football
on Sundays.

184
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,563
Went to church.
( laughs )

185
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,524
I know I did.

186
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,776
But I can't picture it anymore.

187
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:07,656
It's funny how you don't even
notice the time go by.

188
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:11,159
Horrible shit just stacks up
day after day.

189
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,245
You get used to it.

190
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,582
I haven't gotten used to it.

191
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,791
Of course you haven't.

192
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,919
You're the kind of guy
who saves babies.

193
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,088
It's kind of like saving an anchor
when you're stuck without a boat

194
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,048
in the middle of the ocean.

195
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:33,265
Been behind
some kind of walls, right?

196
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,518
You're still around, but you haven't
had to get your hands dirty.

197
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:37,811
I can tell.

198
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,771
See, you're a good guy.

199
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,859
You have no idea
about the things I've done.

200
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,779
You're a good guy.

201
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:51,617
That's why you're gonna die today.

202
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,077
It's why the baby is gonna die.

203
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,627
Or...

204
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,004
you can get in that car,

205
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:06,256
get out of here,

206
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,383
keep on being lucky.

207
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,510
You think you're gonna kill me?

208
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,182
Why haven't you killed me?

209
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,018
How does having me alive
help you?

210
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,395
Why the hell are you
even talking to me?

211
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:26,652
Take her, take the car, and go.

212
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,948
I don't want to do this today.

213
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,496
( walkers snarling )

214
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:41,166
Man: Backs to the walls
on either end of the car, now!

215
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,512
( snarling )

216
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,727
Move! Move!

217
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,563
Help! Help! Help!

218
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,714
( gunshots )

219
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:06,645
( explosion )

220
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,314
- Is that Terminus?
- Yeah.

221
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:12,526
Probably.

222
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,613
Maybe you're gonna win this.

223
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,616
Maybe your friend--

224
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:23,578
I mean,
maybe that woman

225
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,455
just got capped.

226
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,294
Maybe I'm gonna be the one
who gets capped when she comes back.

227
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,505
Nobody's gotta die today.

228
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:34,840
( scoffs )

229
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,259
Man, if you believe that...

230
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,012
then it's definitely
gonna be you and the kid.

231
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,517
Even if that place
is burning to the ground.

232
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:49,563
( gunfire )

233
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,400
Man on radio:
Mary, what the hell was that?

234
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,528
Mary, do you copy?

235
00:19:58,406 --> 00:19:59,906
- You stay here.
- These guys aren't going anywhere.

236
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,158
Stay here until I know
what's happening!

237
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:05,203
Man #2:
So we just sit here?

238
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,414
Got a job to do.

239
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:09,207
( grunting )

240
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,084
( gunfire continues )

241
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:12,711
( gasping )

242
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,547
( snarling )

243
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,550
Oh, Jesus.

244
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,552
Man:
Get them!

245
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,056
( snarling )

246
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,235
( screaming )

247
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,958
- You there, Gareth?
- He's busy.

248
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:53,710
You smell the smoke?

249
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:56,087
You hear the shots?
He could be dead.

250
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,757
The hell we doing here?
The whole place could be going up.

251
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:01,134
You went on one roundup
and you blew protocol.

252
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,219
We don't deal with security.
That ain't our job.

253
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,723
This is.
Hey, look at me.

254
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,350
What?

255
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,771
No, no, no, no!

256
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,068
Glenn:
Rick!

257
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,120
What the hell is going on?

258
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,414
- Michonne: Someone hit them.
- Maybe our people got free.

259
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:33,166
Excuse me.

260
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,045
What the hell are you doing?

261
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:39,464
I might be able to use this shell
to compromise the door.

262
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,466
From the sound of things, there may
not be anybody left to open it.

263
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,301
Eugene, I'm sorry,
but shut up.

264
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,679
- Okay.
- Hey.

265
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:49,349
My dad's gonna be back.

266
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:53,144
- They all are.
- They are.

267
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,772
And we need to get ready to fight
our way out with them when they do.

268
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,581
( snarling )

269
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,257
- Man: There's too many!
- ( woman screaming )

270
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:24,676
( gunfire continues )

271
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,638
( screaming )

272
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,708
( gunshot )

273
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,716
( snarling )

274
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,927
If they got problems,
we got a chance.

275
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,721
It sounded like a bomb.

276
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,558
- Sounds like a damn war.
- Right there.

277
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,435
What the hell are these people?

278
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,353
They ain't people.

279
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,356
Don't.

280
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,233
Let him turn.

281
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:37,248
Cross any of these people,
you kill them.

282
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,042
Don't hesitate.

283
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:42,837
They won't.

284
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,300
( gunfire continues )

285
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:55,266
( man screaming )

286
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,729
Rick:
If we run, we can get by them.

287
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,481
They're distracted.

288
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:03,733
We got to let those people out.

289
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:08,446
That's still who we are.

290
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,573
It's got to be.

291
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:17,872
Man:
Help me!

292
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,625
Left flank.

293
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,755
Man:
Help!

294
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:28,383
Please help me!
Please!

295
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:29,968
Come on, come on,
come on.

296
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,179
We're the same!

297
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,723
We're them!

298
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,601
- Back off!
- We're the same.

299
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,314
( snarling )

300
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,191
Come on.

301
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:48,319
( grunting )

302
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:07,964
( gunfire )

303
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:46,002
- ( gunfire continues )
- ( people shouting )

304
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,087
- We got to double back.
- Rick: A is that way.

305
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,839
We go back,
we don't know where we are.

306
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,549
We don't really have
a choice, do we?

307
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,718
( gunshots )

308
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,851
- Wait here.
- Rick. Rick!

309
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,990
( snarling )

310
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,622
- Man: Reloading!
- ( people yelling )

311
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,513
( groans )

312
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,939
( walkers snarling )

313
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,946
( woman screaming )

314
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,490
( screaming )

315
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,328
( screaming )

316
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:04,664
We're gonna have to double back.

317
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,834
( gunfire continues )

318
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:34,986
- ( gun cocks )
- Drop your weapons and turn around.

319
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,656
I want to see your face.

320
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,409
( walkers snarling, pounding )

321
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:43,453
Now!

322
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,519
( grunting )

323
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,192
Ah!

324
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,028
( panting )

325
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,041
The signs...

326
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,378
they were real.

327
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,963
It was a sanctuary.

328
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:41,094
- People came and took this place.
- Just tell me where--

329
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:44,889
And they raped and they killed

330
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:49,727
and they laughed over weeks.

331
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:51,813
But we got out

332
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,399
and we fought
and we got it back.

333
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,943
And we heard the message.

334
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:03,908
You're the butcher...

335
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,410
or you're the cattle.

336
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,246
The men they pulled from that train car,
where are they?

337
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,046
- ( screams )
- Where are they?

338
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,424
( groaning )

339
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,014
Now...

340
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,643
point it at my head.

341
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,440
( laughing )

342
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,526
You could have been
one of us.

343
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:44,031
You could have listened
to what the world is telling you.

344
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:47,452
You lead people here and you take
what they have and you kill them?

345
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,120
Is that what this place is?

346
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,330
No, not at first.

347
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,541
It's what it had to be.

348
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,961
And we're still here.

349
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,470
You're not here.

350
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:09,265
Neither am I.

351
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:18,399
( snarling )

352
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:21,319
No! No! No!

353
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,362
God! No, God!

354
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,157
No! No!

355
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,786
( walkers snarling )

356
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,672
Back off!

357
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,675
( crying )

358
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,428
Back off!

359
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:49,514
Put your weapons on the ground.
Kick them over right now.

360
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,349
Right now!

361
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,689
Tyreese:
Please.

362
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,488
Please, don't hurt her.

363
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:07,782
( crying )

364
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,700
Go outside.

365
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,954
Go outside!

366
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,622
Just one twist, man.

367
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,291
- Don't!
- Don't make me!

368
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,046
( crying )

369
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,923
Go outside.

370
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,268
- ( snarling )
- ( screaming )

371
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,023
- ( walkers snarling )
- ( Tyreese shouting )

372
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:42,567
Cynthia, do you copy?

373
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,235
( banging )

374
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,195
Cynthia, do you copy?

375
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:48,447
- ( pounding )
- ( Tyreese shouting )

376
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,782
( pounding stops )

377
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,743
( walker gurgling )

378
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,621
( fussing )

379
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:11,387
( grunts )

380
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:23,608
Yeah.
That's how it works.

381
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,735
I won't.

382
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,236
( grunts )

383
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,531
I won't!

384
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,783
I won't!

385
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,953
- ( blows landing )
- Tyreese: I won't!

386
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,206
I won't!

387
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,626
( gunfire )

388
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:09,362
What's the cure, Eugene?

389
00:33:10,364 --> 00:33:11,906
It's classified.

390
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,284
We don't know
what's gonna happen.

391
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,495
Abraham:
You leave him be.

392
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:21,624
- We need to keep working.
- Yeah, but it's time to hear it.

393
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,167
'Cause we don't know
what's coming next.

394
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,503
What's next is we get out of this.

395
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:27,755
Even if I told you all,

396
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,924
even if I provided
step-by-step instructions

397
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:32,510
complete with illustrations
and a well-composed FAQ

398
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:34,345
and I went red-ring...

399
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,348
the cure would still
die with me.

400
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,725
I'm not gonna let that happen.

401
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,187
The best-case scenario,

402
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:46,190
we step out into a hellstorm
of bullets, fire, and walkers.

403
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,358
I'm not fleet of foot.

404
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:48,984
I sure as hell can't take
a dead one down

405
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,695
with sharp buttons
and hella confidence.

406
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:54,323
Yeah, but we can and we will.

407
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:58,703
You don't owe us anything.

408
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,955
Not yet.

409
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:03,040
But we just want to hear it.

410
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,709
You don't have to.

411
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:22,727
I was part of a 10-person team

412
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,146
at the Human Genome Project
to weaponize diseases

413
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,648
to fight weaponized diseases.

414
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:32,361
Pathogenic microorganisms
with pathogenic microorganisms.

415
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:34,280
Fire with fire.

416
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:36,282
Interdepartmental drinks were had,

417
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:38,659
relationships made,
information shared.

418
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:43,122
I am keenly aware of all the details
behind fail-safe delivery systems

419
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,583
to kill every living person
on this planet.

420
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:48,127
I believe with a little tweaking
on the terminals in DC,

421
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:49,879
we can flip the script.

422
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,256
Take out every
last dead one of them.

423
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:55,384
Fire with fire.

424
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:05,519
All things being equal,
it does sound pretty badass.

425
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,772
So let's get back to work.

426
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,940
- ( banging )
- ( gasps )

427
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,611
Come on!
Fight to the fence!

428
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:17,615
Abraham:
We do not leave his side!

429
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:20,284
- Go, go, go!
- Carl!

430
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:22,745
Let's go!

431
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,357
( gunshot )

432
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:00,491
Up and over.

433
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:03,118
Abraham:
Let's go, let's go! Move!

434
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:13,629
Abraham:
Let's go! Move!

435
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,715
Rosita:
Come on!

436
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:36,193
Right here.

437
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:41,031
Abraham: The hell
are we still around here for?

438
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,534
Rick:
Guns, some supplies.

439
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:47,705
Go along the fences.
Use the rifles.

440
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:49,540
Take out the rest of 'em.

441
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,250
What?

442
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:53,711
They don't get to live.

443
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:58,716
Rick, we got out.
It's over.

444
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:03,470
It's not over till they're all dead.

445
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,390
The hell it isn't.
That place is on fire.

446
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:07,725
Full of walkers.

447
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:09,727
Abraham:
I'm not dicking around with this crap.

448
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:11,729
We just made it out.

449
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:13,772
The fences are down.

450
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,566
They'll run or die.

451
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,824
Did you do that?

452
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,457
( laughs )

453
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,420
Rick:
Thank you.

454
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,803
You have to come with me.

455
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,122
( crying )

456
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,840
Judith.
You're okay.

457
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:05,676
( sobbing )

458
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:25,029
( no audible dialogue )

459
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,552
( Judith crying )

460
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,220
What happened?

461
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,765
There were a bunch
of walkers out here

462
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:55,601
and he got his hands
around Judith's neck.

463
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:57,519
No, he's dead.

464
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:01,190
I-- I had to.

465
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:02,816
So I did.

466
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,277
I could.

467
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,743
I don't know if the fire
is still burning.

468
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,413
It is.

469
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:21,376
Yeah.
We need to go.

470
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:22,920
Daryl:
Yeah, but where?

471
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:25,089
Somewhere far away
from there.

472
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:33,055
We'll talk to him.

473
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:36,558
Not just yet.

474
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,739
( whimpering )

475
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,033
Alex:
Mom, Mom! Mom.

476
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:38,412
( Mary gasping )

477
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,497
No! No!

478
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,709
Man:
That one.

479
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:46,170
No, no, please.
Not again.

480
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,172
( sobbing )
No! No!

481
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,049
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

482
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,510
- It's okay. It's okay.
- ( shrieks )

483
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,848
No, it's not.

484
00:41:58,016 --> 00:41:59,683
( chuckles )

485
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,852
( screams )

486
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:10,068
- ( door shuts )
- ( latch clangs )

487
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:13,947
We're gonna take it back.

488
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:15,699
How?

489
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,911
We will.

490
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:23,457
You're either the butcher
or the cattle.

491
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,919
Oh.

492
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:33,634
( theme music playing )
