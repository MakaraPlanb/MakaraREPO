1
00:00:02,795 --> 00:00:06,089
( loud banging )

2
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:10,802
( grunting )

3
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,191
It was--

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,318
it was good
you weren't here for it.

5
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:29,404
She hanging in there?

6
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,364
( banging continues )

7
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,282
No.

8
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,924
( hammering )

9
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:51,926
Are you gonna take
the cross, too?

10
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,183
If we need it.

11
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:18,077
He wants to go to Atlanta,
but I can't have that.

12
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:21,497
Then you stay. I'll go.

13
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,542
I owe it to Carol.

14
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,211
We all owe Carol.

15
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:30,798
I owe her more.

16
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,325
All right.

17
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:07,752
We'll be back soon.

18
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,587
I know.

19
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,475
( Judith crying )

20
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:51,629
- ( hammering echoes )
- ( crying continues )

21
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,500
( spits )

22
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,425
( breathing heavily )

23
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:40,511
( theme music playing )

24
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,898
Yeah?

25
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,652
You know I've been there.

26
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,948
I know.

27
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,495
Bob, he would have wanted--

28
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:49,413
Don't.

29
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,585
I'm sorry.

30
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,754
Please, don't.

31
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,093
Okay?

32
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,735
( monitor beeping )

33
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,786
Excuse me.

34
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,664
I'm just checking on her.

35
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,633
( walkers snarling )

36
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,329
They got no clue
we're here.

37
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,540
That's great news
for GREATM.

38
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,667
In less great news
for GREATM,

39
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,336
we just scraped the bottom
of the water barrel.

40
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,089
What is--
what's GREATM?

41
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:25,009
Us. Group name.
Solidarity.

42
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:26,302
Band of brothers.

43
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,846
GREATM.

44
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,850
Thinking about getting
a tattoo on my knuckles.

45
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,773
Sorry, I'm just trying to think
of something else, you know?

46
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,691
Yeah.

47
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,487
Anything?

48
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,363
No.

49
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,702
Should we get him
to the church?

50
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,788
Moving him
could make him worse.

51
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,873
What will make him better?

52
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,167
Waking up.

53
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,211
If he doesn't...

54
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,803
Come on.

55
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,931
You haven't had anything
to drink all day.

56
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,183
Take the bottle.

57
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,687
Seriously, my six-year-old nephew
didn't pull this shit.

58
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,275
( sighs )
Don't do this, Abraham.

59
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,403
- Look at me!
- Don't.

60
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,572
Look at me!

61
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,246
( gun clicks )

62
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,253
Sit down
or I'll put you down.

63
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,365
Well, what's next
on the agenda?

64
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:14,451
At sundown we fire
a shot into the air.

65
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,453
Get two of them
out on patrol.

66
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,663
Then once it's dark enough

67
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,708
that the rooftop spotter
won't see us, we go.

68
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:22,209
We cut the locks
on one of the stairways,

69
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:23,752
take it to the fifth floor.

70
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,630
I open the door,
Daryl takes the guard out.

71
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,299
How?

72
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,635
He slits his throat.

73
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,679
This is all about
us doing this quiet,

74
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:34,972
keeping the upper hand.

75
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,224
They're not expecting us.

76
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:40,477
From there, we fan out.
Knives and silenced weapons.

77
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,980
We need to be fast.

78
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:46,567
Tyreese, Sasha,
take them.

79
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:50,487
Daryl, you take care
of whoever is in the kitchen.

80
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,489
I got Dawn.

81
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,659
If they're smart,
the rest of them will give up.

82
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,161
Then it'll be five on three.

83
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,496
Six on three once we get
a weapon to Beth.

84
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,416
12 on three.
The wards will help.

85
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,339
That's best case.
What's worst case?

86
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,635
All it takes
is one of those cops

87
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,637
going down the hall
at the wrong time.

88
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:18,265
Then it's not quiet.
All hands on deck.

89
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,517
We're talking about
a lot of bullets flying around.

90
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,520
- If that's what it takes.
- It's not.

91
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,357
If we get a couple
of her cops alive,

92
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,193
out here,
we do an even trade.

93
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:33,614
Theirs for ours.
Everybody goes home.

94
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,449
Yeah, I get it.

95
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,618
And it might work.

96
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,871
This will work.

97
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,168
Nah, that'll work, too.

98
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:48,629
You say this Dawn,

99
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,673
she's just trying to
keep it together, right?

100
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,342
Trying and doing
are two different things.

101
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,387
You take two of her cops away,

102
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,223
what choices does she have?

103
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,392
Everybody goes home.

104
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,560
Like he says.

105
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,247
Pick one.

106
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,458
You need to learn
how to defend yourself.

107
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,920
We can teach you.

108
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,344
Defend myself?

109
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,513
They said they'd go.

110
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:42,224
Carl: They were liars
and murderers.

111
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,060
- Gabriel: Just like us.
- We protected ourselves.

112
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,438
They wanted us dead.

113
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,860
You're lucky your church
has lasted this long.

114
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,282
You can't stay
in one place anymore.

115
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,118
Not for too long.

116
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,787
And once you're out there,

117
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,874
you're gonna find trouble
you can't hide from.

118
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:09,918
You need to know
how to fight.

119
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,639
Good choice.

120
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,725
But you're not
holding it right.

121
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:27,019
You've got to be able
to drive it down

122
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,480
'cause sometimes
their skulls aren't as soft

123
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,191
- and you need to be able--
- I'm sorry.

124
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,360
( swallows )

125
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:37,988
No.

126
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,700
I need to lie down.

127
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,584
Dawn:
That's your plan, huh?

128
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,753
O'Donnell: Look, we are doing
everything we can.

129
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,630
Licari is out
in the sedan right now.

130
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,840
If there is a sign of Noah,
we are going to find him.

131
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,717
You just told me that your plan

132
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,053
was counting on him
screwing up.

133
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:05,182
That's some active
police work right there.

134
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,646
Was there anything else?

135
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,191
Yes, actually, there was.

136
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,403
The patient in exam room two,

137
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,446
she was half dead
when I brought her in.

138
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:22,658
She's not looking so good.

139
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,785
This ain't Pin the Tail
On the Donkey.

140
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,245
Are we really gonna
keep wasting

141
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,038
valuable resources on this lady?

142
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,707
How much electricity
does your DVD take?

143
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:31,875
Excuse me?

144
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:34,795
We have very limited
resources here.

145
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,463
You charge it every day.

146
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,258
- Are you kidding me?
- Beth.

147
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,760
That woman has been
here one day.

148
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,138
- Beth.
- What good is this place

149
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,764
if it doesn't try to save people?

150
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,599
Turn off the machines.

151
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,478
Tell Edwards to take the patient
off of his rounds.

152
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,188
If she pulls through
on her own, then fine.

153
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,691
But you're right.
She's not worth the effort.

154
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,657
( door closes )

155
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,119
( sighs )

156
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,621
You just killed that woman.

157
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,208
Who do you think
I have to side with?

158
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:16,128
Tell him. Tell him you
changed your mind.

159
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,255
You don't know how fragile
this thing is.

160
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:21,758
There's nothing I can do.

161
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,431
So you'll just have to do it.

162
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,310
You're gonna save
that woman's life.

163
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,732
This is to the drug locker.

164
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,609
I don't even trust
Edwards with this.

165
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,360
So take it.

166
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,321
Shepherd on radio:
It's Shepherd. I'm on roof detail.

167
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:45,699
Just heard a gunshot
maybe a mile north-northeast.

168
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:48,952
Grab Lamson, take a car
and track it down.

169
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,704
Yes, ma'am.

170
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:54,374
Why are you doing this?

171
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,877
I thought you were weak.

172
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:00,964
You've proved me wrong.

173
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,677
Glenn:
We need more water.

174
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,346
There's a creek up the road

175
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,431
a few miles southwest of here.

176
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,810
Y'all go.
I'll stay here.

177
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,480
- You sure?
- I am.

178
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,028
Okay.

179
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,878
( walkers snarling )

180
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:52,599
Just stay here, guys.
Don't get up.

181
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,852
There is nothing
for you in Washington.

182
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,021
That's not funny.

183
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,691
It's not not
not not funny.

184
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,193
Hey, I get that we're all dealing
with things in different ways--

185
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:07,322
Listen, I don't know what to do
without DC anymore,

186
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,533
but I'm not dealing with it.
I'm over it.

187
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,577
I just want him to be okay.

188
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:15,205
Eugene wasn't strong.
He isn't fast.

189
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,040
He doesn't know
how to use a weapon.

190
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,418
The truth hurts,
but he's useless.

191
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,712
He had one skill
that kept him living.

192
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,964
Are we supposed to be mad
at him 'cause he used it?

193
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,719
Damn right.

194
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,597
Get over yourself.

195
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,810
You're not the only one
who lost something today.

196
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,940
It's never gonna get
any better than this.

197
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,711
Beth.

198
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,796
Can I?

199
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,133
Yeah, sure.

200
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:40,809
The woman
in exam room two,

201
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,019
what medicine
would you give her?

202
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,563
Dawn called it.

203
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,566
I know, but if you could,
what would you give her?

204
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:51,194
She was in a car accident.
She suffered internal injuries.

205
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:54,197
- It's just a guessing game.
- So guess.

206
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:58,410
You have the key.

207
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:01,663
Did you take it
or did she give it to you?

208
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,707
Because if she gave it to you,
she did not do it

209
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,000
out of the kindness
of her heart.

210
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,961
Don't. Just tell me
what medicine.

211
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,714
I was trying to save my life.

212
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,718
I'm still wondering if I did.

213
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:20,557
Epinephrine drip,
five milligrams.

214
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:24,478
She won't wake up
right away,

215
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,397
but it'll ease her blood pressure
so she'll have a shot.

216
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:34,196
Hey.

217
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,699
Good luck.

218
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:48,794
( sighs )

219
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,296
Perfect.

220
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:54,424
You think it's any
clearer upstream?

221
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,551
( fabric ripping )

222
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,514
Probably not.

223
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,974
Doesn't matter.

224
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,810
Let me see.

225
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,275
Tara: So, you just built a water filter
in about two minutes, huh?

226
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,528
Eugene taught me.

227
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,989
Takes a while, but it'll be clear.
Then we can boil it.

228
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:22,410
Were you with Abraham
before it all happened?

229
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,412
No.

230
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,123
No, I was with other people
just trying to make it.

231
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,879
How'd you wind up together?

232
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,884
We crossed paths in Dallas.

233
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,762
Me and my group, we were
fighting off some dead ones

234
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,639
and he jumped in
from out of nowhere

235
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,766
with that big truck.

236
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,810
Rest in peace.

237
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:48,728
He had Eugene in the cab.

238
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:49,938
And afterwards,
he told me

239
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:51,815
that he was trying
to save the world.

240
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,069
And that he saw
what I could do.

241
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,405
And he wanted my help.

242
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,451
He was the first person
to ask me for that

243
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,620
since this all started.

244
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,711
Maybe he was lying, too.

245
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,762
( splashes )

246
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,015
You see that?

247
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,810
Those ripples.

248
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,812
Those are fish.

249
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:34,107
Okay, how?

250
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,151
Come on.

251
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,487
Lamson:
Shots were from over there.

252
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,364
I swear to God I heard it.

253
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,994
- ( gunshots )
- There. There!

254
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,378
- Put it down, Noah.
- Put the gun down.

255
00:20:57,548 --> 00:21:00,050
( car door closes )

256
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:03,136
Hands up.
Turn around.

257
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,146
You let me know
if it's too tight, okay?

258
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:14,314
I thought you were smart, Noah.

259
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,358
You think we wouldn't hear you?

260
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,030
Where are those rotters
you were shooting at?

261
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,616
( whistles )
Hands.

262
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,076
What do you want?

263
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:29,746
Whatever this is,
we can help.

264
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:33,833
You do what we say,
we don't hurt you.

265
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,255
Okay.

266
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,469
Good.
Now turn around.

267
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,222
Put your guns on
the floor and kneel.

268
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,444
We need to talk.

269
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:05,615
There's water if you
need some and food.

270
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,579
Mind if I ask you something?

271
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:18,044
The way you talk...

272
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,923
the way you carry yourself...

273
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:25,301
were you a cop?

274
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,141
Believe it or not,
I was, too.

275
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:34,102
That's Lamson.

276
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,937
He'll be down for this.

277
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,939
He's one of the good ones.

278
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,649
( tires squealing )

279
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,402
( gunfire )

280
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:14,184
( snarling )

281
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:22,358
( flies buzzing )

282
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,163
( car door opens )

283
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,709
Two, on me.

284
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,999
( grunts )

285
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:28,925
( snarling )

286
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:59,038
( grunts )

287
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,334
( silenced gunshot )

288
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,300
Okay.

289
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,636
You win, asshole.

290
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:30,612
Rick. Rick!

291
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,620
Rick...

292
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,163
three is better than two.

293
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,105
Your friend,
what's his name?

294
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,398
I need to talk to him.

295
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,234
Your plan is going to get
me and my friends killed.

296
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,818
We're gonna make it work.

297
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,529
It would work if you had
different cops to trade.

298
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,116
Dawn's running Grady
into the ground.

299
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,035
A bunch of us want her out
and she knows it.

300
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:21,704
Pretty sure she knows we want
Lamson to replace her, too.

301
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,331
Dawn doesn't know that.

302
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,041
She might.

303
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:27,543
And she's smart.

304
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,046
So there's a good chance
you can't make this deal work

305
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:31,673
and that'll leave us all dead.

306
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,842
But if you let us go,

307
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,136
we'll take care
of Dawn ourselves

308
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:40,056
and then we'll let your friends go
and this is over.

309
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:43,476
No, we're not gonna do that.

310
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:48,648
- Shepherd: Do you want to die?
- No.

311
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:50,900
I just need you
to shut up right now.

312
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:59,117
You can make this work.

313
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,995
But you've got to be able
to talk to her.

314
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,247
Noah told us all about her.

315
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:06,416
I've known her
for eight years, ma'am.

316
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,210
I know this woman.

317
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:14,090
And my only interest
is peaceful resolution,

318
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:18,303
not dying, and sleeping
in my bed tonight.

319
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,766
So, please, let me help you.

320
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,228
Please.

321
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:32,817
Hey, Rick.

322
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,944
You're gonna want to hear this.

323
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,240
- ( snarling )
- ( grunts )

324
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,433
Rosita.

325
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,103
( chuckles )

326
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:13,983
Hey, how are we doing
over there, Tara?

327
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:16,903
( gasping )

328
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:21,407
Pretty damn good.
How about you?

329
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,372
A screwdriver.
Phillips head.

330
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,332
Almost.

331
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,418
Almost.

332
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,046
- Now!
- ( laughs )

333
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,673
- Hell, yes.
- It worked.

334
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,509
Nice.

335
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:40,927
You know how to clean
these things?

336
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:42,678
I know how to clean
these things.

337
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,806
Good, we're gonna need that.

338
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:51,187
Wherever we all wind up.
You in?

339
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:55,858
( chuckles )

340
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:57,819
I'm in.

341
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,864
- Good.
- Guys.

342
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:04,659
You will never believe
what's in this bag.

343
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:08,704
Yes?

344
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,791
You, uh...

345
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:14,585
you said you weren't
feeling good.

346
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,629
You doing okay?

347
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:20,174
- Yeah, I was just resting.
- ( Judith crying )

348
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,222
I know all this is new to you.

349
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,393
All of it.

350
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:36,357
I just wanted to tell you,

351
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,067
for you to know...

352
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:42,238
the things that we do...

353
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:46,075
they're worth it.

354
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,244
I already took the machete.
What more do you want from me?

355
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:50,663
I don't want anything from you.

356
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,083
I'm just trying to help.

357
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,131
Thank you.

358
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,266
( coughing )

359
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,147
Here you go.
Come on.

360
00:30:58,315 --> 00:30:59,690
- I can't-- I can't--
- You all right?

361
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,484
- I can't breathe.
- Get Edwards now.

362
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:03,653
- You, get a gurney.
- I got it.

363
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,030
- O'Donnell: It's okay. Look at me.
- Alvarado: Take it easy.

364
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:07,865
O'Donnell:
Breathe. Breathe.

365
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:09,992
( coughing continues )

366
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,830
Alvarado:
All right. Easy, easy.

367
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,624
O'Donnell:
Stay with me.

368
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,505
Breathe.

369
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:24,757
- Breathe.
- ( coughing stops )

370
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,511
I-- I'm okay.

371
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:32,098
I don't know what that was.
Thank you.

372
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,630
( distant door closes )

373
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:16,726
Carol.

374
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:21,606
It's Beth.

375
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:30,323
I just wanted you to know
that I was here.

376
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:40,583
( snarling )

377
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,137
( rips )

378
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,599
( rips )

379
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:07,902
( clangs )

380
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,115
I'm gonna say it
and you're gonna listen.

381
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:16,619
And then, when you're ready,
you let me help you.

382
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,331
You got to say good-bye.

383
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:25,127
He saw it.
He felt it.

384
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:27,505
And you hold onto
whatever you want to,

385
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:29,965
but I think you should
hold onto that.

386
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,890
I should have been able
to do it myself.

387
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:41,143
You could've.

388
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:43,771
But you let yourself feel it.

389
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:46,565
Kept your eyes open.

390
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,151
You let me help you.

391
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:21,016
( breathing heavily )

392
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,085
( groans )

393
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,114
She'll tell you
she won't make a deal.

394
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:21,160
She'll tell you
she won't compromise.

395
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:23,120
But she will.

396
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,289
She always does.

397
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:30,252
Just-- just know
who you're talking to.

398
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,633
Probably heading out
in the next 10 minutes or so.

399
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:37,927
Anything you need
before we leave?

400
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,430
Actually, water would be great.

401
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,559
Will do.

402
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,728
Thanks, Sergeant Lamson.

403
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:49,355
My name's Bob.

404
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:54,443
You're still a cop.

405
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,863
No.

406
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:00,282
No, the real ones are all gone.

407
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:14,380
( rustling )

408
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,474
( snarling )

409
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:03,679
Damn it.

410
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:17,318
( sighs )

411
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,194
I'm-- I'm okay.

412
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,697
I'll be okay.

413
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,700
Me, too.

414
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,869
The parking lot,

415
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:30,539
when you were bringing us
back up here I-- I saw a rotter.

416
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:34,543
I saw one of the rotters
and I knew him.

417
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:50,184
His name was Tyler.

418
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:53,062
I met him at Grady.

419
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,898
We were both sent there
when shit started going down.

420
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,985
It took two whole days
to evacuate everyone.

421
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:02,237
Didn't sleep.
We didn't eat.

422
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:07,117
But still, it was
the two best days of my life.

423
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:14,750
I was supposed to drive
the last van of survivors to the zone

424
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:16,877
and Dawn pulled me off.

425
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:19,755
She wanted someone
she could really trust

426
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:21,799
and she put Tyler on it instead.

427
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,428
These-- these people
were gonna all be evacuated.

428
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,430
I was really pissed.

429
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,141
I saw him out there.

430
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:35,854
Stuck out there,
melted to the asphalt.

431
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,442
And all I could think was,

432
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,569
"That would have been me.

433
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,532
It would have been me.
He saved my life."

434
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,701
He's been out there
the whole time.

435
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,452
Like he's a part of the street.

436
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,330
Some screwed up,
endless joke.

437
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:58,961
And there's nothing
I can do about it.

438
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,756
So let me help you.

439
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,720
Do you remember
where he was?

440
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:13,058
Yeah, I-- I can take you
right to him.

441
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:15,602
We're not going out there,
but I'm a good shot.

442
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:18,272
Show me.

443
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,652
Okay.

444
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:28,073
South side of the building.

445
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:30,784
You can see him from in there.

446
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:55,267
You're thirsty.

447
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:57,102
Don't say you're not.

448
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,115
Did you want me to shoot you?

449
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,536
I thought I did.

450
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:20,125
But I didn't.

451
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:29,301
( groaning )

452
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,055
Eugene:
Hell-- hello?

453
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:36,225
I'm coming.

454
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:42,648
Stay right there.
Don't try to move.

455
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:45,818
You're gonna be okay.

456
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,744
You know, the more
I think about it,

457
00:40:55,912 --> 00:41:01,333
maybe it wasn't completely
not not not funny.

458
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:05,420
( walker snarling )

459
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,965
Hey.

460
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,426
Don't even look at it.

461
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:40,122
You see him?

462
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:46,420
About 20 yards
right of the sedan.

463
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,383
There's a half wall.

464
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:56,096
He's leaning against it.

465
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:03,187
I see him.

466
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,982
Are you sure that's him?

467
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:21,246
( theme music playing )
