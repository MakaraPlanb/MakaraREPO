00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,004
( panting )

2
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:12,512
( snarling )

3
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,571
( walkers snarling )

4
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,257
( engine starts )

5
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:51,175
( tires squeal )

6
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,428
- ( panting )
- ( walkers snarling )

7
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,191
Stop.

8
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,901
Stop right now.

9
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,446
Stop.

10
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,240
I won't ask again.

11
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,203
- ( engine revs )
- Oh, shit.

12
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,376
( groans )

13
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:35,303
Son-- son of a bitch.

14
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:38,222
You son of a bitch.
Help me.

15
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,684
Son of a bitch.

16
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,563
Help me.

17
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:48,357
You crazy-- you crazy
son of a bitch.

18
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,861
I think you-- I think
you broke my back.

19
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,071
Didn't have to be like this.

20
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,199
You just had to stop.

21
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,285
I couldn't.

22
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:00,953
I don't know you.

23
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:05,917
But I think-- I think
I'm getting the idea.

24
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,960
You just had to stop.

25
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,213
- Take me back.
- ( walkers snarling )

26
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,215
Take me back to the hospital.

27
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:17,345
I did it for your friend.

28
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:20,640
Not after this, no.

29
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,642
Can't go back, Bob.

30
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,061
( bottle rattles )

31
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,649
I was gonna iron it over.

32
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,444
She's under it.

33
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,573
And you've been
out here too long.

34
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,871
You'll die.
You'll all--

35
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:52,129
Shut up.

36
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,020
( theme music playing )

37
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,181
( snarling )

38
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,838
( walkers snarling )

39
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,462
( flies buzzing )

40
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,942
( shouts )

41
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,741
( snarling )

42
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,095
( panting )

43
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,016
( snarling )

44
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,709
Please!

45
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,669
Let me in!

46
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,589
Please!
Let me in!

47
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:24,091
They're close!

48
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,177
Help!
They're coming!

49
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,515
Please don't leave me out here!

50
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,225
Please!

51
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,187
Don't leave me out here!

52
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,731
Carl! Michonne!

53
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,150
I had to see it!
I know now!

54
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,693
Let me live with it!

55
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,987
Oh, God, please.

56
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,906
- Wait.
- Help!

57
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:50,284
Let me in!
Oh, God, please!

58
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:53,954
Help me!
Help!

59
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,749
Carl! Michonne!

60
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,542
Get back.

61
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,504
Please!
Help!

62
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,964
Help!

63
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,716
Help me!

64
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,470
Oh, God, please!

65
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:13,099
Let me in!
Let me in!

66
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,851
Help!

67
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,187
Help me!

68
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,898
Please, let me in!

69
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,192
- Please!
- Come on!

70
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,069
Help!

71
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:27,238
Get back.

72
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:43,212
The rectory, come on.

73
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,565
That's how I got out.
Crawl under to the back.

74
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,608
Just go.
Take the little one and go.

75
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,780
( Judith crying )

76
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,786
Hey, hey.
You wait for me.

77
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,923
It's worth it.

78
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,925
I'm not going anywhere
until you're gone.

79
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,667
- Come on.
- I can't run anymore.

80
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,628
We're not running.

81
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,480
( banging )

82
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,064
He wouldn't stop.

83
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,567
This change things?

84
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,569
It has to.

85
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,491
Maybe not.

86
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,828
Well, she said the plan won't work.
The guy who did is dead.

87
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,955
Maybe we gotta rethink this.

88
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:27,209
But they also said the cop in charge
didn't have any love for him.

89
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,378
Maybe you did her a favor.

90
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,547
I don't know if they'll play ball.

91
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,967
Let's find out.

92
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,769
He was a good man.

93
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,483
He was attacked by rotters.

94
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,777
I saw it go down.

95
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:56,196
Huh.

96
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,701
You're a damn good liar.

97
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:02,369
We're hanging
by a thread here.

98
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:05,205
He was attacked by rotters.
That's the story.

99
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,124
You said the trade was a bad idea.

100
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:08,625
What changed?

101
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,128
Lamson was our shot.

102
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:14,131
So it's this or you go in
guns blazing, right?

103
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:15,924
You don't want that.

104
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,177
If this is some bullshit you're spinning
and things go south--

105
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,803
I know.

106
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:23,140
I know the good ones
from the bad.

107
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,142
Let us help you.

108
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,316
What about you?

109
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,612
You wanna live?
How much?

110
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,701
Dawn's afraid she'll look weak
in front of us.

111
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,996
Thinks it'll tip things
against her.

112
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:50,084
Hell, it will.

113
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,504
She'll see this trade as a rip-off

114
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,256
if she thinks you took out
one of our guys.

115
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:01,261
So it's a good thing
Lamson got aced by rotters.

116
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,854
Shepherd, Lamson,
what's your 20?

117
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:17,069
I need status on that gunfire.
Do you copy?

118
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,322
( sighs )

119
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,741
Licari, do you copy?

120
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,787
Does anybody copy?

121
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,875
Damn it.

122
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,503
Beth:
Something wrong?

123
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:39,508
( sighs )
They don't always radio back

124
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,969
and it drives me crazy.

125
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,182
Wait, no, no, no.
Beth, no, not there.

126
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,769
Up by the badges.

127
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,397
Thank you.

128
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,571
Is this Captain Hanson?

129
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,656
( sighs )

130
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,077
Did someone say something
about him to you?

131
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,580
Just that he used
to be in charge.

132
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:13,500
Well, you'll hear
stories about him.

133
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,588
About me.

134
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,674
About what I did.

135
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,434
( exhales )

136
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:32,644
He was my mentor.

137
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,814
My friend.

138
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,196
I miss him.

139
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,782
That's the part
the stories leave out.

140
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,534
What happened to him?

141
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,791
They risk their lives

142
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,170
every time they go out there.

143
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,422
Has to be worth it.
Has to matter.

144
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,884
He lost sight of that.

145
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,554
So he lost them.

146
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,308
Beth, in this job
you don't need their love...

147
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,687
but you have to have
their respect.

148
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,899
Otherwise,
the day is gonna come

149
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,985
when you need backup
and you don't have it.

150
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,654
And what comes next?

151
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,699
Everybody goes down.

152
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,123
Hanson lost his way.

153
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,292
That's what happened.

154
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,880
- ( walkers snarling )
- ( banging )

155
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,189
Where did you go?

156
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,651
The school.

157
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,987
I had to see.

158
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,780
I had to know.

159
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:09,866
( banging )

160
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,380
Where do we go?

161
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:26,341
( wood cracking )

162
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:30,470
( vehicle approaching )

163
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:47,696
( turns off engine )

164
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,380
- Maggie: You okay?
- Michonne: Yeah.

165
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,137
You're back.

166
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,849
Eugene lied.

167
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,685
He can't stop it.

168
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,937
Washington isn't the end.

169
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,233
Where is everybody?

170
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,909
Beth's alive.
She's in a hospital in Atlanta.

171
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:37,037
Some people have her,
but the others went to get her back.

172
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,747
Do we know which one?

173
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,457
Grady Memorial.

174
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:47,964
Oh, my God.
( laughs )

175
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,222
Let's blow this joint,
go save your sister.

176
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,307
( laughs )

177
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,142
O'Donnell:
No, Percy, tell me.

178
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,936
Should I use smaller words?

179
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,105
Is the directive
fix the hole in my sleeve

180
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,648
too complicated for you?

181
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:06,692
- I'm sorry. I forgot.
- Well, here's an idea.

182
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,193
Don't forget.

183
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:11,738
What about you?

184
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,115
You any good
with needle and thread?

185
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,408
Dawn:
I need her. Sorry.

186
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,576
We have a lot of work to do.
Come on, Beth.

187
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,421
( door opens )

188
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,354
Percy's going to be okay.

189
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,691
Nothing's okay.

190
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,946
Are you going to jump?

191
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,452
I wanted to be alone.

192
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,538
You left your elevator key
where it was.

193
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,959
Well, I know you're
not going anywhere.

194
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,047
Neither are you.

195
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,095
You--

196
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,682
you keep telling yourself
you have to do whatever it takes

197
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,185
just until this is all over.

198
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:27,022
But it isn't over.

199
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:29,566
This is it.

200
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:33,069
This is who you are
and what this place is until the end.

201
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,906
This place saved you.

202
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,743
I saved you.

203
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:41,411
Twice.

204
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,456
The others don't know
what you did.

205
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,629
They think Joan was trying
to get back at me

206
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:54,090
and that Gorman and Jeffries were
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

207
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,426
- That's what happened.
- Bullshit.

208
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,846
I saw the smashed jar.

209
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:03,892
I closed up my office and I fixed it
before it could be a problem.

210
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:07,979
You're a cop killer.

211
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,607
- I would never kill somebody.
- But you did.

212
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,279
What do you think would happen
if the others found out?

213
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:18,448
I protected you.

214
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:22,494
And we helped that patient.

215
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,746
I didn't have to, I wanted to.

216
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,581
But there's a way
things have to happen here.

217
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,417
- Don't you get that?
- ( door closes )

218
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,306
What are you gonna do?

219
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:46,351
No, Dawn, what are you
gonna do?

220
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,437
- Starting with her.
- She's my ward. It's my call.

221
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:54,025
Fine, but your people deserve to know
who they're working for.

222
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,528
So, you gonna tell them or am I?

223
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,700
You don't get to threaten me.

224
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,452
That's not a threat.

225
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,329
But these are the facts.
You look like shit.

226
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:07,956
The guys were talking.
They think you're cracking.

227
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,875
This is Hanson all over again.

228
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:14,087
It's time to make a change.

229
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:16,172
O'Donnell.

230
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,341
You're wrong.

231
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,680
I'm nothing like Hanson.

232
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,310
I was the one who killed him,
remember that?

233
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,896
I was the only one
who could go through with it.

234
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,364
Lower your weapon, Dawn.

235
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:42,699
All I have to do is shout.

236
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,701
All I have to do
is say you came at me.

237
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,244
Beth, get out of the way.

238
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,540
You're not gonna do this.

239
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,876
You're not giving me a choice.

240
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,464
Go.

241
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,386
We were rookies together.

242
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:06,139
You knew my wife.

243
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:08,767
You were here in this hospital

244
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,978
having cigars with me in the parking lot
when my kid was born.

245
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,647
Don't.

246
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:17,901
That guy is gone.

247
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:20,445
We're supposed to protect people.

248
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,405
To help them.

249
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,575
But look at you.

250
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,871
You're beating the old man.

251
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:34,292
You're laughing
with your buddies

252
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,379
about that poor girl
getting raped.

253
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,591
- That's who you are now.
- So who the hell are you?

254
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,302
Somebody who's not gonna
let it happen anymore.

255
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,596
That's not what this is about.

256
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:51,476
It's about holding on
to what you have.

257
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,145
What the hell do I have?

258
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,900
This isn't you.

259
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:02,529
After Hanson, you changed.

260
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:04,781
( grunts )

261
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,469
You think you're better than us?!

262
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:30,056
Stay in your lane, bitch!

263
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:32,017
( gasping )

264
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:34,936
Beth!

265
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,691
( screams, thuds )

266
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,401
( splatters )

267
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:44,237
( walkers snarling )

268
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:48,825
Thank you.

269
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:24,903
It's okay to cry.

270
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:28,156
I don't cry anymore.

271
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:29,949
I do.

272
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,496
I just don't let them see it.

273
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:41,503
It's from my own stash.

274
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,421
There's no strings.

275
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,428
I know now
why you covered for me.

276
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,601
You weren't protecting me.

277
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,813
You were protecting yourself.

278
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:05,443
Is that so?

279
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:09,364
Gorman, Jeffries, O'Donnell--

280
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:11,449
they were problems for you.

281
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,201
And now they're not.

282
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:16,913
And you didn't have to do
the dirty work.

283
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,920
That's how things get done here.

284
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:26,798
Everyone uses people
to get what they want.

285
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:30,135
You're not the ones
who have to remember.

286
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:34,180
Is that what happened
with Edwards and Trevitt?

287
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,057
He used you?

288
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:45,191
I'm gonna get out.

289
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,153
Just like Noah.

290
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:53,533
- He'll be back.
- He's going home.

291
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:55,535
They always come back.

292
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:58,997
They don't ever get far
because they can't.

293
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:00,790
But really...

294
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,210
they don't want to.

295
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:06,588
He's going home.

296
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:16,181
I was like you
when I was younger.

297
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,477
Nobody could tell me anything.

298
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:25,315
I'm not stupid.

299
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,235
You know her.

300
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:31,905
And somehow you both
wound up here.

301
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,407
Maybe that means something.

302
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:37,744
Beth, you can be
a part of this thing.

303
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:40,663
Both of you.

304
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:42,498
This is important.

305
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:46,127
Maybe the most important thing
you do in your life.

306
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:48,588
And what you did
back there...

307
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:59,933
Gorman and O'Donnell
hurt people.

308
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:04,771
The world didn't lose anything
when they died.

309
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,483
And you're wrong
about what happened.

310
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:10,526
I didn't use you.

311
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:16,616
And I will remember.

312
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,759
You're beating yourself up.

313
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,344
Don't.

314
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,764
I was stupid.

315
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,029
At the church,

316
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,490
that guy you killed,

317
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:59,284
his name was Martin.

318
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,620
We had him.

319
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,580
Me and Carol.

320
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,375
Back by Terminus.

321
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:12,630
Then she went in after you all
and it was just me and him.

322
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:15,758
I said I killed him.

323
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:22,265
I could have done it,

324
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:25,184
maybe I should have
done it, but...

325
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,769
I didn't.

326
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:31,316
I keep thinking about it.

327
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,779
I remember
when we were kids

328
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:39,657
and you used
to follow me around,

329
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,909
copying every little thing I did.

330
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:47,790
What happened to both of us,

331
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:50,501
maybe it's because
we're still the same.

332
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,464
Just like we were back then.

333
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:58,134
And maybe that's good.

334
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:00,136
You're still the same.

335
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,141
And that is good.

336
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,105
I don't think I can be.

337
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,235
Not anymore.

338
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:20,448
Not anymore.

339
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,547
( snaps fingers )

340
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,592
They're headed towards
the vantage point.

341
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,178
- ( radio static hissing )
- Rick: Okay.

342
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:43,888
Copy that.

343
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:13,501
Officer Franco.
Officer McGinley.

344
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:16,337
I'm Rick Grimes.

345
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,967
I was a deputy in the King County
Sheriff's Department.

346
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:23,344
I'm here to make a proposal.

347
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:26,264
Lay your weapon on the ground.

348
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:30,268
All right.

349
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:06,053
What's your proposal?

350
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:09,974
You have two of my people,
I have two of yours.

351
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,310
We want to make an exchange.

352
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:15,021
Then we'll be on our way.
No one gets hurt.

353
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:22,195
- Who?
- Rick: Officers Shepherd

354
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:26,491
and Licari
for Beth and Carol.

355
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,244
You picked up
a woman yesterday

356
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:32,497
after your people
hit her with a car.

357
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,631
Noah, he's with you?
That's how you know?

358
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,133
Yes, he is.

359
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,886
What about Officer Lamson?

360
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,515
He was attacked by the dead
before we got to him.

361
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:53,976
Where are your people?

362
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:55,811
( silenced gunshot )

363
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,151
They're close.

364
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:12,787
Radio your lieutenant.

365
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:14,455
I'll wait.

366
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,680
Holster your weapons.

367
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,642
You, too.

368
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:27,088
They haven't been harmed.

369
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:30,174
Where's Lamson?

370
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:32,134
Shepherd:
Rotters got him.

371
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,638
We saw it go down.

372
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:39,350
Oh.

373
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,562
I'm sorry to hear that.

374
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,315
He was one of the good guys.

375
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,030
One of yours for one of mine.

376
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:55,825
All right.

377
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:58,828
Move.

378
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,873
Dawn:
Glad we could work things out.

379
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,209
Yeah.

380
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,713
( whispering )

381
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:52,965
Now I just need Noah.

382
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,847
And then you can leave.

383
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,726
That wasn't part of the deal.

384
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:06,020
Noah was my ward.

385
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:07,897
Beth took his place
and I'm losing her,

386
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,398
so I need him back.

387
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,400
- Ma'am, please, it's not--
- Shepherd!

388
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:16,155
My officers put their lives
on the line to find him.

389
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:18,657
One of them died.

390
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,910
No, he ain't staying.

391
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,245
He's one of mine.
You have no claim on him.

392
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:26,665
The boy wants to go home,
so you have no claim on him.

393
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,338
- Well, then we don't have a deal.
- The deal is done.

394
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:34,507
- It's okay.
- No. No.

395
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,469
I got to do it.

396
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:44,225
It's not okay.

397
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,310
It's settled.

398
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,190
Wait!

399
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:58,781
It's okay.

400
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:02,326
I knew you'd be back.

401
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,803
I get it now.

402
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:27,643
- ( flesh squelches )
- ( gunshot )

403
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,493
( silent )

404
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,248
( gunshot )

405
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:52,668
No! Hold your fire!

406
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,298
It's over.

407
00:36:58,592 --> 00:37:00,801
It was just about her.

408
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,639
Stand down.

409
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,481
( sniffles )

410
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:19,486
( crying )

411
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,349
You can stay.

412
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:53,270
We're surviving here.

413
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,814
It's better than out there.

414
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,068
No.

415
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:04,615
And I'm taking anyone back there
who wants to leave.

416
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:10,788
If you want to come with us...

417
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,126
just step forward now.

418
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:42,653
( snarling )

419
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,583
( snarling )

420
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,327
( wailing )

421
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:35,080
( sobbing )

422
00:39:57,979 --> 00:40:00,939
( theme music playing )

423
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:05,254
( walker snarling )

424
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,474
( snarling )

425
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:37,119
Shh.

426
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:24,499
( laughs )

427
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:48,523
"Sorry I was an asshole."
