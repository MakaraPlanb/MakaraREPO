1
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:06,714
( ticking )

2
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:31,280
( pounding )
Hey! Hello!

3
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,241
Hey!

4
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:36,202
( police radio chatter )

5
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:41,124
( radio chatter continues )

6
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:46,754
Everything's okay. Okay?

7
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,382
Put it down.
Drop it right now.

8
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:53,261
I'm Dr. Steven Edwards.

9
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:56,472
This is Officer Dawn Lerner.
How are you feeling?

10
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,015
Where am I?

11
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:01,102
Grady Memorial Hospital
in Atlanta.

12
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,937
How did I get here?

13
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:04,689
My officers found you
on the side of the road

14
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:06,190
surrounded by rotters.

15
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:07,525
Your wrist was fractured

16
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,152
and you sustained
a superficial head wound.

17
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,696
Can you remember
your name?

18
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:13,322
Beth.

19
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:22,749
The man I was with,
is he here, too?

20
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:23,916
Dawn:
You were alone.

21
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,753
If we hadn't saved you,
you'd be one of them right now.

22
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:31,424
So you owe us.

23
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,307
( theme music playing )

24
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,679
- ( monitors beeping )
- ( respirator hissing )

25
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,684
Couple of them out there
were on a run about a week ago.

26
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,561
They found two boxes of Bisquick

27
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,688
and a Merle Haggard tape
at a truck stop,

28
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,107
and then this gentleman
under a bridge.

29
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,735
Cardiac arrest
and extreme dehydration.

30
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,572
I tried to do what I could.

31
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,825
- ( respirator stops )
- ( rapid beeping )

32
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,370
Wait, that's it?

33
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:45,373
If patients don't show
any signs of improvement...

34
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,916
( flatline beeps )

35
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,668
Well, Dawn calls it.

36
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,389
( squelching )

37
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,102
( no audible dialogue )

38
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,988
- Hold up.

50
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,916
How many people live here?

51
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,500
Just enough to keep us going.

52
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,961
Some of us started here.
Some came as patients.

53
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,005
Everyone has a job.

54
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:17,924
Can't we bury him?

55
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,134
No, we only go out
when we need to.

56
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,762
It may not be the most
dignified disposal system,

57
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,098
but we work
with what we have.

58
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,310
We've managed to secure
and guard the stairwells,

59
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,646
but the windows are blown out
on the ground floor.

60
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,356
Rotters find their way
into the basement

61
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,523
when they hear a noise.

62
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,984
And if the bodies are warm,
or warm enough,

63
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,986
they clean up
some of the mess.

64
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,905
Use everything
you can use.

65
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:43,282
Plus it's the fastest
way down.

66
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,869
( crash )

67
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,537
( splatter )

68
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,332
( walkers snarling )

69
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,679
You're looking better and better.

70
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,933
We had a lead on some guns,

71
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:11,477
so me and my partner
were pretty far out.

72
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,855
That's when we saw you,

73
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,066
wriggling in the road.

74
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,694
You don't remember me, huh?

75
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,571
I was fighting a walker.

76
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,865
And then everything went black.

77
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:29,203
Yeah, one was eyeing your thighs
when we showed up.

78
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,872
But I got there first.

79
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,916
Jacked that rotter up.

80
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,544
I'm Gorman.

81
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:38,254
When someone
does you a favor,

82
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:41,382
it's a courtesy to show
some appreciation.

83
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,761
Unless you want me to write down
everything you're taking.

84
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,434
Everything costs
something, right?

85
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:58,482
Huh.

86
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,027
Dawn:
Well, find Joan.

87
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,571
Until then,
you've got laundry duty

88
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:04,739
and I want my uniform...

89
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,241
Both: ...washed separately
and pressed.

90
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,119
I know.

91
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,038
Smart-ass.

92
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,958
( music playing )

93
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,049
( sighs )

94
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,093
I used to feel like
I was drowning in research.

95
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,637
Now the oceans are dry

96
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,515
and I'm suffocating
in boredom.

97
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,935
You're lucky.

98
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:38,481
If you feel safe enough
to be bored,

99
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,274
you're lucky.

100
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,986
That's Junior Kimbrough.
You like it?

101
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,992
I can't remember the last time
I heard a record.

102
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,161
It's one of the few perks I get

103
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,537
for being the only doctor here.

104
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:57,625
That and whatever this is?

105
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,418
Guinea pig.

106
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,295
Where's your food?

107
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,048
The more I take,
the more I owe, right?

108
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:06,133
Hey.

109
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,804
Have you ever tried
guinea pig?

110
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,140
I didn't think so.

111
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,642
You wouldn't call it a perk.

112
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,644
( chuckles )

113
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:18,354
Sit down.

114
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,064
Dawn doesn't have to know.
Come on.

115
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,863
Here.

116
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,832
( chuckles )

117
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,630
Well?

118
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,465
- Hmm.
- ( laughs )

119
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,217
It's good enough for Peru.

120
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,640
It's a Caravaggio.

121
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,226
I found it on the street
outside the High.

122
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:58,727
Like trash.

123
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,271
It's beautiful.

124
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,940
It doesn't have
a place anymore.

125
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,111
Art isn't about survival.

126
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,865
It's about transcendence.

127
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,200
Being more than animals.

128
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:14,618
Rising above.

129
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,954
We can't do that anymore?

130
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,583
I don't know.

131
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,877
I sing.

132
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,379
I still sing.

133
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,010
- We got a new one.
- Man: Found his wallet.

134
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,429
His name is Gavin Trevitt.

135
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:35,306
Woman: Fell from
a first floor apartment

136
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,099
trying to get away from some.

137
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:39,560
( no audible dialogue )

138
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,270
He's lost a lot of blood
and his vitals are dropping.

139
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,771
I don't think
he's gonna make it.

140
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,398
- We've already given him gas--
- I got this.

141
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,984
You said you wanted
to save people, so save him.

142
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,986
I don't even know
the extent of his injuries.

143
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,279
Look, this one's a loser.

144
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,780
You said you didn't want me
wasting resources.

145
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,657
Well, today I want you to try.

146
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,578
Okay, plug the EKG
and the ultrasound

147
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,663
into that battery pack.
Go. Good.

148
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,082
Good, good, good.
Now attach it to the patient.

149
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,419
( monitor beeping )

150
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,591
( rapid beeping )

151
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,927
Tension pneumothorax.
Punctured lung.

152
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,596
Beth, I need a large hollow
needle in that cabinet.

153
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,480
( groans )

154
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,615
( beeping slows )

155
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,705
Is he gonna make it?

156
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,832
He fell from a building, Dawn.

157
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,377
Is he going to make it?

158
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,796
You see these bruises?

159
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,339
He has internal bleeding,

160
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:51,632
but I need a CAT scan
to know how bad.

161
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,050
And even if I could
determine that,

162
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,969
I don't have the tools
to save him.

163
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:59,014
I told you, this was a waste
of resources.

164
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:08,482
Steve, try to grasp
the stakes here.

165
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,738
( door slams )

166
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,998
Beth:
Is she always like that?

167
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,332
Steven:
Only on her bad days.

168
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,545
It's unfortunate for us
that's the only kind she has.

169
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,548
Noah left you a new shirt.

170
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,216
What's wrong with this one?

171
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,552
She likes things neat.

172
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,847
She must love your office.

173
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:41,974
We all have ways
of making her pay.

174
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,351
I'll wait for you outside.

175
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,379
Dawn needs you, now.

176
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,718
Dawn:
She's lucky we found her.

177
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,887
Whatever you were thinking,
it wasn't worth it.

178
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:22,056
Okay, you have two choices.

179
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,640
Either we cut off your arm
or you do.

180
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,894
Screw you
and your little bitch!

181
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:29,813
- Smart-ass whore.
- Gorman, get out of here!

182
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,735
( humming )

183
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,073
- ( grunts )
- It's anesthetic. You need it.

184
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,992
- Go to hell.
- She made her choice. Do it.

185
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,620
Do it.

186
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,498
No, no, no!
I said leave me alone!

187
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,166
We're not going to let you die.

188
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,627
- We are not going to let you turn.
- ( Joan crying )

189
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,796
Where do you think
you're going?

190
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,924
- I can't help.
- Do you want her to die?

191
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:58,884
Beth, I need you
to hold her down.

192
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,470
- Do it now. Now.
- ( sobbing )

193
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,263
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Come on.

194
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,933
Keep your hands off me!

195
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,601
I'm not going back to him!

196
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,103
You don't have to.

197
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,688
- You can't control them.
- I will.

198
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,732
Beth, you ready?

199
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,944
( screaming )

200
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,458
( hissing )

201
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,253
( door opens, closes )

202
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,632
You okay?

203
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,300
I'm Noah...

204
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,845
of the Lollipop Guild.

205
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,764
Beth.

206
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,684
Thanks for that.

207
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:51,145
Figured you could
use a pick-me-up

208
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,106
after this morning.

209
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,692
Guess I should have
brought the whole jar.

210
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,488
Here, this should fit.

211
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:08,495
You know what
happened with Joan?

212
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,832
If she'd have stayed,
worked for a while,

213
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,333
couldn't she have just left?

214
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,835
( chuckles )

215
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,212
I haven't seen it
work like that yet.

216
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,173
How long have you been here?

217
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,841
I guess about a year.

218
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,891
Dad and I were
both pretty messed up

219
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,518
when they found us.

220
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:34,188
They said that they could
only save one.

221
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,899
For the longest time,
I actually believed them.

222
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:41,320
Now I get it.

223
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:44,740
Dad was bigger, stronger.

224
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:46,408
Would have fought back.

225
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:47,576
Would have been a threat.

226
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,037
They left him behind
on purpose?

227
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,623
And Dawn just looked
the other way.

228
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,251
See, she's in charge,
but just barely.

229
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,587
And it's getting worse.

230
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:02,007
It's why I'm out of here
when the time is right.

231
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,260
I came looking for my uncle.

232
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,513
Gotta get back to my mom.

233
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,223
Where's home?

234
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,974
Richmond.

235
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:13,185
Virginia.

236
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,395
We had walls.

237
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,815
See, they think I'm scrawny.

238
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,902
They think I'm weak.

239
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,279
But they don't
know shit about me.

240
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,574
About what I am.

241
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:31,078
About what you are.

242
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,253
Shepherd, you've already
pulled a double.

243
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,589
- I got it from here.
- Yes, ma'am. Thanks.

244
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:46,260
I know you didn't
have breakfast.

245
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,387
Peace treaty?

246
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,264
I don't need much.

247
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,766
I'm not staying any longer
than you make me.

248
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:13,287
You know, you shouldn't
see this as a sentence.

249
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:18,375
I'm giving you food,
clothes, protection.

250
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:21,128
When have those things
ever been free?

251
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:22,296
I never asked for your help.

252
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,172
But you needed it.

253
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,138
Try to look at
the good we're doing.

254
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,267
Hard as it was,
we saved Joan's life.

255
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,728
Trevitt's life.
We saved your life.

256
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,190
I'm keeping
all of us going here.

257
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,359
That is not a small thing.

258
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:54,328
It's taken a lot
to get us here, Beth.

259
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,873
And I believe that what we had
before all of this isn't over.

260
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,792
And when we're finally rescued,

261
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,669
when this nightmare ends,

262
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,296
we're gonna need to rebuild.

263
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,256
You don't really think
someone's coming for us?

264
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,342
There's still people like us, Beth.

265
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,303
People trying to keep
the world alive, to fix it.

266
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,680
Until then,
we all have to contribute.

267
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,934
To compromise.

268
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,895
If we take, we give back.

269
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,022
It's only fair.

270
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,652
So keep working off
what you owe

271
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,904
and you'll be
out of here in no time.

272
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,406
- If that's what you want.
- It is.

273
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,367
Well, then you have to eat.

274
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,329
Otherwise, you'll get weak.

275
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,831
You won't heal,
you'll require more treatment,

276
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,334
and you won't be able
to do your job.

277
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,548
I know you didn't ask for this.

278
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,554
I didn't either.

279
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,576
( Beth humming )

280
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,750
Hmm.

281
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,046
That's really nice.

282
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,635
I'll get Dr. Edwards.

283
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,762
No, please.

284
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,932
Not yet.

285
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,859
I'm so sorry.

286
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,113
She can control them.

287
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,615
But she doesn't
because it's easier.

288
00:17:58,536 --> 00:17:59,953
Because she's a coward.

289
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,832
What did he do to you?

290
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,375
It doesn't matter.

291
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:08,420
I guess it's easy to make
a deal with the devil

292
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,047
when you're not the one
paying the price.

293
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:33,361
( clock ticking )

294
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,889
Lose something?

295
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,184
This is yours, ain't it?

296
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,400
Mmm.

297
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,862
Sour apple.

298
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,740
Like the kind Dawn
acquired from pediatrics.

299
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:22,744
Suppose you could
have a taste.

300
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,038
See if it rings any bells.

301
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,707
- I don't want it.
- Oh, come on, now.

302
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:28,875
I just want to be sure

303
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,294
I'm returning this
to its rightful owner.

304
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,594
Ah, ah.

305
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,725
Yeah. That's right.

306
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,521
- That's right. That's right.
- Leave her alone.

307
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,943
The girl should have
been mine.

308
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,404
Nobody's yours, Gorman.

309
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:59,322
Nobody.

310
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,949
And if you think
you're getting Joan back--

311
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,243
Oh, I'm gonna get her back.

312
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,495
You think Dawn's
gonna stop me?

313
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,124
I will.

314
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:11,501
You stepping up, Doc?

315
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:17,173
What happens when
you get sick, Gorman?

316
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,218
When you get an infection?

317
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,178
When you get bit?

318
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,014
Hmm.

319
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,516
I think there's
gonna be somebody.

320
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,685
Somebody who ain't you.

321
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,104
Dawn:
Gorman.

322
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:37,193
And maybe somebody
in charge who ain't her.

323
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,878
Beth:
Why do you stay?

324
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:56,796
You could leave
whenever you want.

325
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,340
Why do you stay here?

326
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:06,806
( door opens )

327
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,558
( footsteps )

328
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:12,145
Welcome to the ground floor
of Grady Memorial Hospital.

329
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:14,940
This isn't a way out.
There isn't one.

330
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,568
Not from here.

331
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,237
Why'd you bring me here?

332
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,156
Watch.

333
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,202
( clanging )

334
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,831
( snarling )

335
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,838
When I start thinking
about it too much,

336
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,840
I come down to look at this.

337
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,926
Why'd you bring me here?

338
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:47,013
You asked why I stay.

339
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:56,022
Come on.
Let me tell you a story.

340
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,369
When everything started,

341
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,871
Dawn reported to a guy
named Hanson.

342
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,290
They had orders
to clear the hospital

343
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,043
and move everyone
to Butler Park.

344
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:20,213
It was close to midnight
when we heard the jets,

345
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,382
the bombs.

346
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:25,885
The screams.

347
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,262
I was on the third floor.

348
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,347
Dawn and Hanson's teams
were doing a final sweep,

349
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,057
and we knew it was bad.

350
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,226
Just didn't know how bad
till we came up here.

351
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:35,061
The city had fallen.

352
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,691
And everyone we evacuated...

353
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,404
they were just gone.

354
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:49,743
We kept mostly
to ourselves at first.

355
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,619
Till the food ran out.

356
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:57,292
We started going out on runs,
a few of us at a time.

357
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,586
We'd see people
who needed help.

358
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:01,171
Barely holding on,

359
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:04,799
but we were barely
holding on ourselves.

360
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,261
Came a time I couldn't
look away anymore.

361
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:13,433
I found this kid,

362
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:16,352
napalm burns on his clothes,

363
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,438
his skin.

364
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:22,525
Dawn said we couldn't
spare the resources.

365
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:25,528
So we struck a deal.

366
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,198
I'd use what I could to heal him
and he'd compensate us

367
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,158
for those resources
through service.

368
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,327
( scoffs )

369
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,663
Now...

370
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:40,126
You're not the problem.

371
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:42,587
We lost people.

372
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,798
That was the problem.

373
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,174
Hanson cracked.

374
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,134
He made some calls
that got people killed.

375
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,180
Dawn took care of things.

376
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:55,683
She took care of him.

377
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,979
She saw us past it.

378
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,856
Kept us together.

379
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,026
Kept us alive.

380
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:09,322
You call this living?

381
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,074
( chuckles )

382
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:14,160
I'm still breathing.

383
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:17,831
Patients we brought here,
they're still breathing.

384
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,124
Outside these walls,

385
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,375
alone, unprotected,
they'd be dead.

386
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:22,168
We'd be dead.

387
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,256
We're not the ones
who make it.

388
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:30,927
As bad as it gets,

389
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,221
it's still better
than down there.

390
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,352
I should get back.

391
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:42,772
How about you look in
on Mr. Trevitt

392
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,191
- and call it a day?
- Okay.

393
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:48,027
He's stable, due for another
75mg of Clozapine.

394
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,699
And tomorrow
we'll start fresh.

395
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:54,742
Sure.

396
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,880
( monitor beeping )

397
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,945
Noah:
Still at it, huh?

398
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,864
Hey.

399
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:36,659
( rapid beeping )

400
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:38,912
( gasping )

401
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:43,124
No.

402
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,376
What?

403
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,920
No.

404
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,172
( grunts )

405
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:51,799
What did you do to him?

406
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,426
I-- I--

407
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:56,846
He was fine until the two of you
were alone with him.

408
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:59,933
Something happened.
I want you to tell me.

409
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,518
It was an accident.
Beth left to get some gauze.

410
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:03,895
I was mopping.

411
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,063
I must have unplugged
the ventilator somehow.

412
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:06,522
- It only stopped for a minute.
- Beth: But that's--

413
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,983
Noah:
I got it working again.

414
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:10,652
Take him to my office.

415
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,615
Dawn, it was an accident.
It was an accident.

416
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,367
That's not what happened.

417
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:21,037
He just--
he just started seizing.

418
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:22,497
Seizing?

419
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:25,458
Well, you gave him
Clonazepam, right?

420
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,627
Cloz-- Clozapine.

421
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,631
You said Clozapine.

422
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,637
No, I didn't.

423
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:40,515
- Noah: Please!
- ( blows landing )

424
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:42,725
Beth, we need to deal with Mr. Trevitt
while he's still warm.

425
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:46,145
- I have to stop it!
- Noah: Please, stop!

426
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,481
- Please!
- We can't-- you can't stop it.

427
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,659
You really think
I didn't know?

428
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:05,164
Noah's smart.

429
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,500
Probably my best worker.

430
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:10,795
But that story he told
about the ventilator?

431
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,964
Boy's not much of a liar.

432
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,800
If you knew,
then why did you--

433
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,970
I didn't want to.
I had to.

434
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,805
A good man's mistakes

435
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,307
almost ended
everything for us,

436
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,726
and I'll be damned
if I'm gonna let that happen again.

437
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,897
Every sacrifice we make

438
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,066
needs to be
for the greater good.

439
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,111
The second it isn't,

440
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,155
the second we lose
sight of that,

441
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,157
it's all over.

442
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:47,081
The thing is, you're not
the greater good.

443
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,377
- You're not strong enough.
- I am strong.

444
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:54,088
How many people had to risk
their lives to save you?

445
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:57,884
In here, you are part
of a system.

446
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,096
The wards keep
my officers happy.

447
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:03,848
The happier my officers are,

448
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,768
the harder they work
to keep us going.

449
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:11,856
And this hasn't been easy.

450
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,484
There have been compromises,

451
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,527
but it's working.

452
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,738
And after they rescue us,

453
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:21,032
we're gonna help put
the world back together.

454
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,492
Because we're the ones
holding on.

455
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,452
That's the good we're doing here.

456
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,205
That's the good you're doing here.

457
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,374
That's what makes you
worth something.

458
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,211
But out there...

459
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,589
you are nothing...

460
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:41,469
except dead
or somebody's burden.

461
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:43,096
- That's bullshit.
- Oh, yeah?

462
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:46,224
I saw this the night
you came in.

463
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,267
Is this bullshit, too?

464
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,657
Some people just aren't
meant for this life,

465
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:04,075
and that's okay...

466
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:08,996
as long as they
don't take advantage

467
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,957
of the ones who are.

468
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:23,636
Noah:
It's not as bad as it looks.

469
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:26,514
I'm okay.

470
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,683
Watch.

471
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:30,935
Painkillers.
It barely even hurts.

472
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:36,023
Dawn needed Trevitt
for something.

473
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,025
I know that's what
that was about.

474
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,821
Screwed-up thing is,

475
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:43,489
she's trapped, too.

476
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,992
We're not trapped.

477
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:50,329
I'm going with you.

478
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:57,086
Basement's
the fastest way out.

479
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:59,046
Any noise and we got rotters.

480
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,882
So we won't make noise.

481
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,801
I can keep an eye on Dawn.

482
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,887
She keeps a spare key
to the elevator banks

483
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,138
somewhere in her office.

484
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,016
Think you can find it?

485
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,478
Yeah.

486
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,564
( chatting )

487
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:22,195
( man laughing )

488
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,656
In the back.

489
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:20,646
Hey there.

490
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,110
I hope I'm not interrupting.

491
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,947
Dawn was just asking
for her key.

492
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:32,033
Was she, now?

493
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,994
See, I was just with Dawn

494
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,330
and I don't seem
to remember that.

495
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,167
It's okay.

496
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:43,461
Maybe she doesn't
have to know.

497
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:47,131
Maybe there's another solution.

498
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,091
You know?

499
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:51,927
A little win-win for both of us.

500
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,722
( sniffs )

501
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:02,521
So how about it, Bethy?

502
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:05,191
We gonna work
something out here?

503
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:09,820
Good girl.

504
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,824
Now, Joan, she's not
such a team player.

505
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,704
Lucky for me...

506
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,749
you're not a fighter.

507
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:24,710
- ( groans )
- ( snarling )

508
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:27,380
( gurgling )

509
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:48,984
Noah:
Yeah, it may just be the battery.

510
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,903
I'll stop in
and grab another one.

511
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:52,655
Okay.

512
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:56,409
Beth.

513
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:01,163
Everything okay?

514
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:05,209
Oh, Joan was
looking for you.

515
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:08,254
I saw her and Gorman
headed towards your office.

516
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:14,009
Thank you, Beth.

517
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,646
( man screaming )

518
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:37,450
( fabric ripping )

519
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,828
( people shouting )

520
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,121
Ready?

521
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,248
Yeah.

522
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:48,836
Once you're safe,
I'll climb down.

523
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:50,629
Okay.

524
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,310
( grunts )

525
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:06,729
( whimpering )

526
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,570
( screams )

527
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:20,284
( panting )

528
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,454
( snarling )

529
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,042
( screams )

530
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,628
- ( panting )
- Beth: Noah?

531
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:15,256
Noah? Noah?

532
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:19,385
( grunts )

533
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:27,601
( groans )

534
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,897
( both groaning )

535
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:45,119
Can you walk?

536
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:47,079
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- Okay.

537
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,091
( walkers snarling )

538
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:01,010
There.

539
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:11,020
- ( snarling )
- ( gasps )

540
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:17,151
( gunshot )

541
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:19,820
( gunshots )

542
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,030
Noah: Help.

543
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,407
( high-pitched whining )

544
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:03,072

00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:33,143

546
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,115
( snarling )

547
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:01,213
Who the hell
do you think you are?

548
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:03,966
He attacked me.

549
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:08,679
Just like he attacked Joan.

550
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:12,307
Just like you let him.

551
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,642
You know
what's happening here

552
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:14,893
and you let it happen.

553
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,146
- You're letting it happen.
- So that we make it.

554
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,314
No one's coming, Dawn.

555
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:23,444
No one's coming.

556
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,239
We're all gonna die

557
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:30,242
and you let this happen
for nothing.

558
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,635

Edwards:
You're healing quickly.

562
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,443
Should be ready
to jump back into it

563
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:05,778
in a couple more days.

564
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:10,783
Well, that should about do it.

565
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,369
How'd you know
Trevitt was a doctor?

566
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:19,083
That's why you had me
give him the wrong meds, right?

567
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,376
Why you had me kill him.

568
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:26,381
'Cause if he had lived,
there'd be another doctor

569
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,842
and Dawn wouldn't need you.

570
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,929
She wouldn't protect you.

571
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:37,017
Trevitt was an oncologist
at St. Ignatius.

572
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,773
I knew him.

573
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:53,659
They would have kicked me out.

574
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:55,702
Maybe Gorman...

575
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,249
maybe he would have
killed me.

576
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:03,836
I didn't have a choice.

577
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,255
Use everything you can use.

Edwards:
When they arrested Christ,

579
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:14,346
Peter denied being one
of his disciples.

580
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,894
He didn't have a choice.

581
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:24,857
They would have
crucified him, too.
