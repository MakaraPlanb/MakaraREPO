1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,047
( snarling )

2
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,645
Gareth: It's probably
pretty stupid to be here.

3
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:22,772
Dangerous.

4
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,273
I don't know.
Maybe not.

5
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,942
( snarling )

6
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:31,280
You can see the threat.

7
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,866
That's something.

8
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,953
Looking at them makes me
feel better about things.

9
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:40,623
My mom used to say that every day
above ground was a win.

10
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,626
Doesn't really apply anymore, but...

11
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:46,129
you can still get some perspective.

12
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,972
The glass is gonna break
sooner or later.

13
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,809
Nothing lasts too long anymore.

14
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,897
You know,
we marked our way here

15
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,817
so that we could find
our way back after.

16
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:12,321
So stupid, right?
I mean...

17
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,157
back to what?

18
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:28,045
It wasn't just a trap.
It was gonna be a choice.

19
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:31,674
You join us or feed us.

20
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:35,803
You know...

21
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:38,055
bears...

22
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:43,227
when they start to starve,
they eat their young.

23
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:45,396
If the bear dies,
the cub dies anyway.

24
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:47,523
But if the bear lives,

25
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,817
it can always have
another cub.

26
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,574
That was part of the pitch.

27
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:02,163
You know, Greg and Mike
came this close

28
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:04,081
to nabbing that
grey-haired queen bitch

29
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,292
who killed my mom.

30
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,336
She drove away
with the archer.

31
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:10,546
Greg saw them pull away.

32
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:14,050
Can't wait to try her.

33
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:16,010
I like women better.

34
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:17,845
Most of us do.

35
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:20,264
My brother Alex has--

36
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:23,726
also currently dead
because of Rick--

37
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,897
he had a theory that it
was because

38
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,941
of the extra layer of fat
that women have,

39
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,151
you know,
for childbearing.

40
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,445
Even the skinny girls have it.

41
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,409
Like that pretty one--
Sasha?

42
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,204
I think pretty people
taste better, too.

43
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,217
We're going to get all of them.

44
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,427
But for starters,
you'll do just fine.

45
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,097
We did a good job
on your leg.

46
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:04,267
- ( sobbing )
- We've had practice.

47
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,603
When we started,
it was about making it slow.

48
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:13,109
I'm being a human being here.
I'm talking to you.

49
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:16,070
Perspective, Bob.

50
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:17,905
You're above ground.

51
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,782
At least you're
better off than them.

52
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,159
( laughing )

53
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,131
Well, he lost it.

54
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:37,508
Lasted longer than
I thought he would.

55
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,677
( laughing )

56
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,512
You...

57
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,098
you idiots.

58
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,475
- Okay, keep it down.
- ( pounding on glass )

59
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:50,062
I can shut him up.

60
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,485
I've been bitten,
you stupid pricks!

61
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,322
I'm tainted meat.

62
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,366
- ( laughing )
- ( spitting )

63
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,876
- Let's just kill him now.
- No, no, we need him.

64
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:13,336
We might as well
be eating one of them.

65
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,670
What the hell's gonna happen?

66
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,172
Are we gonna turn?
Are we just gonna die?

67
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,174
Albert, calm the hell down.
We cooked him.

68
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:19,800
Everything is gonna be fine.

69
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,510
Why the hell didn't
you check him first?

70
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,304
'Cause he was fine.

71
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:26,432
- Tainted meat!
- Gareth: Shut up.

72
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,185
- You eating tainted meat!
- I said shut up!

73
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,858
( theme music playing )

74
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,272
( whispering )
Bob.

75
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,025
( panting )

76
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,285
( snarling )

77
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,954
( twig snaps )

78
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,757
- ( snarling )
- ( gasps )

79
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,554
( silenced gunshot )

80
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:52,935
- ( muffled scream )
- It's me. It's me.

81
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,147
Tyreese.

82
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,357
- He's getting away.
- Who?

83
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,401
Somebody was watching us.

84
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,445
If we go in there now,

85
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,321
some of us aren't coming back.

86
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,115
Bob is out there somewhere.

87
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,701
Scared, alone.

88
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,327
Maybe not alone.

89
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,496
Daryl and Carol are missing, too.

90
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,130
( silverware clattering )

91
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,298
( doors open )

92
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:36,437
Stop.

93
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:40,691
What are you doing?

94
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,949
What are you doing?

95
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,911
This is all connected.

96
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,330
You show up,

97
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:56,707
we're being watched,

98
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:00,127
and now three of us are gone.

99
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,837
I...

100
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,299
I don't...

101
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:08,010
I don't have anything
to do with this.

102
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,721
- Wait!
- Rosita: Don't!

103
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,183
- Tyreese: Sasha, put it away.
- Who's out there?

104
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,018
I-- I don't have anything...

105
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,354
- to do with this.
- Where are our people?

106
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,481
- I don't have anything to--
- Where are our people?

107
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,191
Please, I don't have
anything to do with this.

108
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,859
I--

109
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,699
Why'd you bring us here?

110
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,662
Please, I--

111
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,248
You working with someone?

112
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,291
I'm alone. I'm alone.

113
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,793
I was always alone.

114
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,711
What about the woman
in the food bank, Gabriel?

115
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,047
What did you do to her?

116
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,466
"You'll burn for this."

117
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,718
That was for you. Why?

118
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,887
What are you gonna
burn for, Gabriel?

119
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,807
What?
What did you do?

120
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,226
What did you do?

121
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,233
I lock the doors at night.

122
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,734
I always lock
the doors at night.

123
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,695
I always lock the doors
at night.

124
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:09,738
I always--

125
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:18,330
They started coming,
my congregation.

126
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,585
Atlanta was bombed the night before
and they were scared.

127
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,087
They were-- they were
looking for a safe place,

128
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,423
a place where they felt safe.

129
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,304
And it was so early.
It was so early.

130
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:37,183
And the doors were still locked.

131
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:43,272
You see...

132
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,152
it was my choice.

133
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,363
But there were
so many of them

134
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,949
and they were trying
to pry the shutters

135
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,827
and banging on the sidings,
screaming at me.

136
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,955
And so the dead came for them.

137
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,293
Women...

138
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,255
children.

139
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,638
Entire families calling my name

140
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,765
as they were torn apart,

141
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,600
begging me for mercy.

142
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,977
( sobbing )
Begging me for mercy.

143
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,814
Damning me to hell.

144
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:33,697
I buried their bones.

145
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,783
I buried it all.

146
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,043
The Lord sent you here
to finally punish me.

147
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,679
I'm damned.

148
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,182
I was damned before.

149
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,519
I always lock the doors.

150
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:07,189
I always lock the doors.

151
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:10,317
( sobbing )

152
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,153
( whistling )

153
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,366
Glenn:
There's something--

154
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,411
there's someone outside
lying in the grass.

155
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,662
Sasha.

156
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,539
( walkers snarling )

157
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,708
Oh! Bob!

158
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,543
Bob.

159
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,504
- His leg.
- Get Bob inside.

160
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:31,672
We'll take care of them.

161
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,218
Can you help me, please?
Help me. Help me.

162
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,557
( gunshot )

163
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:44,018
Get inside!

164
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,227
Go!

165
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:00,951
I was in the graveyard.
Somebody knocked me out.

166
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,579
I woke up outside this place.

167
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:06,874
It looked like a school.

168
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:11,253
It was that guy, Gareth.

169
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,630
And five other ones.

170
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:17,760
They were eating my leg
right in front of me,

171
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,679
like it was nothing,

172
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:24,725
all proud like they
had it all figured out.

173
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:28,312
Did they have Daryl and Carol?

174
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,067
Gareth said they drove off.

175
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,780
( groaning )

176
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,948
He's in pain.
Do we have anything?

177
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,242
I think there are pill packets
in the first aid kit.

178
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,328
- Yeah.
- Save 'em.

179
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,955
- No.
- Really.

180
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:52,878
Damn.

181
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:11,188
It happened
at the food bank.

182
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,610
It's okay.

183
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,162
Bob?

184
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,876
There's a sofa in my office.

185
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,505
I know it's not much, but...

186
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,175
Thank you.

187
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,095
I got him.

188
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,351
Do you know the place
Bob was talking about?

189
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,687
It's an elementary school.

190
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:53,897
- It's close.
- How close?

191
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,361
How close, Gabriel?

192
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,867
It's just a 10-minute walk
through the woods from here,

193
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,910
due south of the graveyard.

194
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:09,580
( Judith crying )

195
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,748
Shh, shh, shh.

196
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,377
Does he have a fever?

197
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,254
He's just warm.

198
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:21,425
Jim lasted almost two days
before we left him.

199
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,053
Time for a reality check.

200
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,723
We all need to leave
for DC right now.

201
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:32,060
Daryl and Carol
are gonna be back.

202
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,062
We're not going
anywhere without them.

203
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,230
I respect that,

204
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,607
but there's a clear
threat here to Eugene.

205
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,151
I need to extract his ass
before things get any uglier.

206
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,944
So if y'all won't come,
good luck to you.

207
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,739
We'll go our separate ways.

208
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,240
You leaving on foot?

209
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,412
We fixed that
damn bus ourselves.

210
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,080
There are a lot more of us.

211
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,375
You want to keep it that way?
You should come.

212
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,086
Carol saved your life.
We saved your life.

213
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,881
Now I am trying to save yours.

214
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,633
Save everyone's.

215
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,052
We're not going anywhere
without our people.

216
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,262
- Your people took off.
- They're coming back.

217
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,014
To what,
picked-over bones?

218
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,807
- You're not taking--
- Do not lay hands!

219
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:14,895
- Abraham!
- Hey, hey, stop! Now!

220
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,816
Do you really think
that you're gonna be any safer

221
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,985
leaving right now
in the middle of the night?

222
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,820
Yeah.

223
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,615
Yeah.

224
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,742
Glenn:
What about tomorrow?

225
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,036
We need each other for this.

226
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,705
We need each other
to get to DC.

227
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,166
We can get through
all of it together.

228
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,462
I have an idea.

229
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:45,676
If you stay just
one more day and help,

230
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,679
I'll go with you to DC
no matter what.

231
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,350
Okay?

232
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,147
Glenn and Maggie, too.

233
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:02,484
- No.
- Good luck, then.

234
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:05,153
I'm not interested in breaking up
what you have here.

235
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,824
Rosita, grab your gear.

236
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,200
- Abraham--
- Now.

237
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:13,745
Eugene, let's go.
Eugene.

238
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,999
Move it.

239
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,710
- I don't want to.
- Now.

240
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,503
Okay.

241
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,975
You're not taking the bus.

242
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,024
Try to stop me.

243
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,578
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

244
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,496
Hey, hey, hey!

245
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,877
You stay--

246
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:05,047
you stay and help us,

247
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,215
and we will go with you.

248
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,426
- No.
- It's not your call.

249
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:15,724
You stay, help us.

250
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,191
Half a day.

251
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,195
Come high noon,
we're taillights.

252
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,990
I'm not waiting for the other
damn shoe to drop.

253
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,576
And we will leave with you.

254
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,626
12 hours.

255
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,421
Then we go.

256
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:01,561
Bob: You know,
the one good thing

257
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,940
about getting
kicked in my face--

258
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:09,611
made me forget
the pain in my leg...

259
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:16,493
and my side,
so two good things.

260
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:19,079
We're not playing
that game anymore.

261
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,960
Well...

262
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:27,796
all things considered,

263
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:31,133
figured you could
humor me a little bit.

264
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,635
( chuckles )

265
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:42,018
Why didn't you tell me

266
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,146
when it happened?

267
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:52,154
I knew when I told you,

268
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,823
it'd become
all about the end.

269
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,163
And I really liked the middle.

270
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:26,480
Rick:
They think they're in control.

271
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,441
We're in here
and they could be anywhere.

272
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,818
But we know exactly
where they are.

273
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,949
Plan's got stones,
I'll give you that.

274
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,203
- Make our move before they do.
- That's right.

275
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,497
They're not counting
on us thinking straight.

276
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,625
Are we?

277
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,920
I'm just making sure.
It's a big play.

278
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,924
Remember what these people
are capable of.

279
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:03,099
- Tyreese.
- Yeah?

280
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,561
You up for this?

281
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:10,524
I'm going with you.

282
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,401
You should stay with Bob.

283
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,112
No, I want to be out there.

284
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,448
I want to be a part of this.

285
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:37,384
I know how it feels.

286
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:40,595
But this right here,

287
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:43,473
the time you could
have with him,

288
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:46,810
you can't throw that away.

289
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,064
I wish I had it with Karen.

290
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:01,157
Do you remember
how you felt?

291
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,079
What you wanted to do?

292
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,459
Yeah.

293
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,296
It made it so I couldn't see it.

294
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,466
Forgiveness.

295
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,094
That's facing it.

296
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:23,638
I should forgive them?

297
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:29,603
For hurting him?
For trying to kill us?

298
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,398
What the hell is wrong with you?

299
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,650
You think we have a choice?

300
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,069
Not all of us.

301
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,322
Just you.

302
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,074
When he opens his eyes,

303
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,119
the only thing he's gonna
want to see is your face.

304
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,003
Take it.

305
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,638
- If he stops breathing...
- Sasha.

306
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,848
...you put it through his temple.

307
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:13,063
That's what Bob would want.

308
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:42,968
( lock clicks )

309
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,136
( tapping )

310
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:53,687
( walkers snarling )

311
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:40,960
Gareth: Well, I guess
you know we're here.

312
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,802
And we know you're here.

313
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,141
And we're armed.

314
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,355
So there's really no point
in hiding anymore.

315
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,369
We've been watching you.

316
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,666
We know who's here.

317
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:26,047
There's Bob,

318
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,800
unless you've put him
out of his misery already.

319
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,637
And Eugene.

320
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,641
Rosita.

321
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:40,019
Martin's good friend Tyreese.

322
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:44,732
Carl.

323
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:52,198
Judith.

324
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:58,079
Rick and the rest walked out

325
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,874
with a lot of your guns.

326
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,258
Listen, we don't know
where you all are,

327
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,427
but this isn't a big place.

328
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,892
So let's just stop this now

329
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,436
before things get more painful
than they need to be.

330
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,117
( rattling )

331
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,756
Look, you're behind
one of these two doors

332
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:52,133
and we have more than enough
firepower to take down both.

333
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,802
Can't imagine that's
what you all want.

334
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,430
( cocks gun )

335
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,353
How about the priest?

336
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,068
Father, you help us
wrap this up,

337
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:12,403
we'll let you walk away
from this.

338
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,410
Just open the door
and you can go.

339
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,496
You can take
the baby with you.

340
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,167
What do you say?

341
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:36,511
( Judith crying )

342
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,017
I don't know.
Maybe we'll keep the kid.

343
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:45,019
I'm starting to like this girl.

344
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:51,359
It's your last chance right now

345
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:52,819
to tell us you're coming out.

346
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,033
Are we done?

347
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,706
We'll hit the hinges.

348
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,000
( silenced gunshots )

349
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,213
Rick:
Put your guns on the floor.

350
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,424
Rick, we'll fire right into that office.
So you lower your gun--

351
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:17,468
- ( silenced gunshot )
- Ah!

352
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:21,055
( whimpering )

353
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:29,147
Put your guns
on the floor and kneel.

354
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,067
Do what he says.

355
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,452
Martin, there's no choice here.

356
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,580
Yeah, there is.

357
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,791
Want to bet?

358
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:56,632
( Gareth gasping )

359
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,699
No point in begging, right?

360
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:25,953
No.

361
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,041
Still, you could have
killed us when you came in.

362
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,709
There had to be
a reason for that.

363
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:35,296
We didn't want
to waste the bullets.

364
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:42,220
We used to help people.

365
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:44,639
We saved people.

366
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:50,103
Things changed.
They came in and--

367
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,563
( groans )

368
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:00,822
After that...

369
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,495
I know that
you've been out there,

370
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,622
but I can see it.

371
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:13,084
You don't know
what it is to be hungry.

372
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,507
You don't have to do this.

373
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:22,176
We can walk away,

374
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:25,138
and we will never
cross paths again.

375
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,014
I promise you.

376
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,852
But you'll cross someone's path.

377
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:40,445
You'd do this to anyone, right?

378
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,697
Besides,

379
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:46,200
I already made you
a promise.

380
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,994
No!

381
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:56,544
( people screaming )

382
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,464
It could have been us.

383
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,607
Yeah.

384
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,473
This is the Lord's house.

385
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,352
No.

386
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,813
It's just four walls and a roof.

387
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:50,241
You'll always be with us.

388
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,159
Part of us.

389
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,593
Rick.

390
00:32:10,304 --> 00:32:12,597
No, don't.

391
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,849
Let her stay.

392
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:17,351
I trust her.

393
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:23,357
I'm right outside.

394
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:31,157
I just want to say thank you.

395
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:33,784
For what?

396
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,120
Before the prison,

397
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:39,665
I didn't know if there were
any good people left.

398
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,503
I didn't know
if anybody was left.

399
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:51,218
You took me in.

400
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:55,556
'Cause you took people in.

401
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,227
It was you, man.

402
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,569
What I said yesterday,

403
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,738
I ain't revising it.

404
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:16,369
Even in light
of current events.

405
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:21,666
Nightmares end.

406
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:26,545
They shouldn't end
who you are.

407
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:34,929
And that is just
this dead man's opinion.

408
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,521
I'll take it.

409
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,943
( chuckles )

410
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:51,112
Just look at her

411
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,198
and tell me the world
isn't gonna change.

412
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,212
( raspy breathing )

413
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,139
You were out.

414
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,807
Hmm.

415
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:21,642
Was I?

416
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,811
You were.

417
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:30,484
Why are you smiling?

418
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,820
I think I was dreaming.

419
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:37,825
And I think you

420
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:41,078
were smiling back
at me in the dream.

421
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:44,999
Yeah, that's it.

422
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:54,091
So what is it?

423
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:59,805
The good that comes
out of this bad?

424
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:13,778
Bob?

425
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,910
Bob?

426
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:26,457
( sobbing )

427
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:05,371
Give it here.

428
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:22,721
You step out.

429
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,100
Okay?

430
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:33,732
( door opens )

431
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,695
( door closes )

432
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:49,874
( breathing heavily )

433
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,885
( squelches )

434
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:24,325
This is our route to DC.

435
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,160
We'll stick to it
as long as we're able.

436
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:29,622
If not, well,
you got our destination.

437
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,666
Once Eugene gets
to the big brains left up there,

438
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,460
things are gonna bounce back.

439
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:37,338
This group should be there for it.

440
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:42,509
You should be there for it.

441
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,011
They will be.

442
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:46,138
We will.

443
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:49,808
We will.

444
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:56,231
Let's go.

445
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:54,498
( shovel striking dirt )

446
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:34,747
I never asked
how it was for you

447
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:37,291
getting to Terminus.

448
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,553
It killed me.

449
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,740
No, it didn't.

450
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,631
( door opens )

451
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,642
I can't sleep.

452
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,823
And now,
sitting in there...

453
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:54,326
Quiet.

454
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,378
It isn't just what
happened last night.

455
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,049
Saying what happened before...

456
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,720
out loud...

457
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,017
I see it all again.

458
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,813
I hear them.

459
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,523
Yeah.

460
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:27,359
That won't stop.

461
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:34,116
But it won't be all the time.

462
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:36,493
( rustling )

463
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,957
Michonne:
Where's Carol?

464
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,296
Come on out.

465
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:35,761
( theme music playing )
