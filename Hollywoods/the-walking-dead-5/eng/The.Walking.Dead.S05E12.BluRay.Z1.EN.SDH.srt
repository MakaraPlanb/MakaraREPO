1
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:30,071
( Judith babbles )

2
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:35,159
- ( rattles )
- ( animal squeals )

3
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:47,588
We brought dinner.

4
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,094
Aaron:
It's okay.

5
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:54,929
Come on in, guys.

6
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:29,630
Before we take this
any further,

7
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,924
I need you all
to turn over your weapons.

8
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:35,303
Stay, you hand them over.

9
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:37,346
We don't know
if we want to stay.

10
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,265
It's fine, Nicholas.

11
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:42,727
If we were gonna use them,
we would have started already.

12
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:44,854
Aaron: Let them talk
to Deanna first.

13
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,439
Who's Deanna?

14
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:49,400
She knows everything
you'd wanna know about this place.

15
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,946
Rick, why don't you start?

16
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,242
( walker snarling )

17
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,328
Sasha.

18
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,917
( gunshot )

19
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,634
It's a good thing we're here.

20
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:20,681
( theme music playing )

21
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,393
Hello.

22
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:06,978
I'm Deanna Monroe.

23
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,729
Rick Grimes.

24
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:12,149
- You mind if I film this?
- What?

25
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,694
Do you mind if I film our talk?

26
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,988
Go ahead.

27
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,827
- Rick: Why film this?
- ( camera beeps )

28
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,247
Deanna: We're about
transparency here.

29
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,836
Please.

30
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:33,671
How long have you
been out there?

31
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,590
Since the beginning.

32
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,091
How did you all find each other?

33
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,676
Did you know each other
before or--?

34
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,970
We didn't know
each other before.

35
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,230
I was a congressperson.

36
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,358
Ohio, 15th district.

37
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,485
You?

38
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,529
I don't think
it matters anymore.

39
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,364
Oh, I know it does.

40
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,784
What is this place?

41
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,746
This is the start of sustainability.

42
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,165
That's what the brochures
we found say.

43
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,500
This was a planned community

44
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:15,171
with its own solar grid,
cisterns,

45
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:18,090
eco-based sewage filtration.

46
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,385
Starting in the low 800,000s...

47
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:24,388
( laughs )
...if there is such a thing.

48
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,307
And they sold them all.

49
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,017
How did you end up here?

50
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,811
Well, my family and I were
trying to get back to Ohio

51
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,898
so I could help my district
manage the crisis.

52
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:35,816
And...

53
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,360
( sighs )
...the army stopped us

54
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,905
on a back road
and directed us here.

55
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:43,074
They were supposed
to come later.

56
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,410
They didn't.

57
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:51,666
But there were supplies here

58
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,751
and we made the best of it.

59
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,170
You put up the wall?

60
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:59,215
Well, there was
this huge shopping mall

61
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:01,467
being built nearby.

62
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,595
And my husband Reg
is a professor of architecture.

63
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:10,101
And who he was
mattered quite a bit.

64
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,520
He got the first plates up
with our sons.

65
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:17,358
And after a few weeks,
more people arrived

66
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:20,111
and we had help.

67
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,988
We had a community.

68
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:26,367
You've been behind these walls
this entire time?

69
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:31,330
We need people who have
lived out there.

70
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,666
Your group is the first
we've even considered

71
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,252
taking in for a long time.

72
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,046
You should keep
your gates closed.

73
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,550
Why?

74
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:48,014
Because it's all
about survival now.

75
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,141
At any cost.

76
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,312
People out there are always
looking for an angle.

77
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,024
Looking to play
on your weakness.

78
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,902
They measure you

79
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,489
by what they can take from you.

80
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:08,534
By how they can
use you to live.

81
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:14,248
So bringing people into
a place like this now--

82
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,793
Are you telling me
not to bring your people in?

83
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:21,464
Are you already
looking after this place?

84
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,510
Aaron says I can trust you.

85
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,679
Aaron doesn't know me.

86
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,057
I've killed people.

87
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:35,227
I don't even know
how many by now.

88
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:39,523
But I know why they're all dead.

89
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,443
They're dead so my family,

90
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:46,197
all those people
out there, can be alive.

91
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,866
So I could be alive for them.

92
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:53,496
Sounds like I'd want
to be part of your family.

93
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,792
Rick,

94
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:02,338
northern Virginia was
effectively evacuated.

95
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:05,800
Millions of people gone.

96
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,593
For a long time,
there's hardly been anyone here,

97
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,471
living or dead, but still...

98
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,517
we have lost people.

99
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,103
And...

100
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,815
I've done things.

101
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,111
What have you done?

102
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:30,533
I exiled three men
who didn't work out.

103
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,285
And we both know that's
as good as killing them.

104
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,708
What do you want from us?

105
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,671
These families...

106
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,260
these families
should be able to raise their children

107
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,845
in a safe environment.

108
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,723
Your son, your daughter,

109
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:58,269
should have a place
to grow up.

110
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,229
What do I want?

111
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,234
I want you to help us survive.

112
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,654
I know you can
help us do that.

113
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,283
How?

114
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:17,538
I am exceptionally good
at reading people.

115
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,374
If I didn't win reelection,

116
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,751
I was gonna be
a professional poker player.

117
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,211
( scoffs )

118
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,714
I'm not kidding.

119
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,550
Rick...

120
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,554
it's 3:37 P.M.

121
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:37,057
You're skeptical.

122
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,354
You have a right to be.

123
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,941
But it's time to decide

124
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,444
if you're the one
who's doing the deciding.

125
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,751
I was a sheriff.

126
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:11,550
Yeah, I knew it was
something like that.

127
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,601
Deanna:
They're still your guns.

128
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,646
You can check them out whenever
you go beyond the wall.

129
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:27,233
But inside here,
we store them for safety.

130
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,134
Should have brought
another bin.

131
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,728
- Both of 'em?
- At your disposal.

132
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,147
I'd call dibs on that one.

133
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,276
It's got more curb appeal.

134
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:14,863
Listen, I know you're
still feeling us out,

135
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,199
but I'm glad you came.

136
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:20,869
Anyway, Deanna's asked everyone
to give you your space

137
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,831
so they aren't all
coming at you at once.

138
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:27,376
Take your time.
Explore.

139
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,837
You need anything,
you call me.

140
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,716
I don't-- we don't have phones.

141
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,844
I-- I meant...
I'm four houses down.

142
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:39,471
- Thank you.
- So...

143
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,883
( water running )

144
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,527
( knocking )

145
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,914
Hey.
I work in the pantry.

146
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,917
Deanna asked me to bring these over
for you and your friends.

147
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,964
Thank you.

148
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:39,466
We're just cleaning up.

149
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:40,884
I can see that.

150
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:44,471
You still have
some shaving cream on your chin.

151
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,143
I'm Jessie.

152
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,104
( sighs )
Rick.

153
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,983
You know,
I used to be a stylist.

154
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:58,318
And 12 other things.

155
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,779
I could give you
a cut if you want.

156
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,117
You don't even know me.

157
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,829
I can take care of myself.

158
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:14,334
I have two boys,
Ron and Sam.

159
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:19,506
Ron's my oldest boy.
He's about your son's age.

160
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,008
I could introduce them.

161
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:24,011
- If that's okay with you and--
- It's just me.

162
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,223
No, that'd be-- that'd be great.

163
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,519
I'm sorry.

164
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,568
Electricity, showers,

165
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,862
haircuts--

166
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,532
I never thought
I'd see those again.

167
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,327
Come on.

168
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:51,246
Haircuts were never
going away.

169
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:56,752
It's okay if you're
not okay with this yet.

170
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,302
That's better.

171
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,064
Deanna:
You're welcome to sit, Daryl.

172
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,107
I won't bite.

173
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,817
Yeah, I'm all right.

174
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,697
Daryl, do you want to be here?

175
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,119
The boy and the baby,

176
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,747
they deserve a roof.

177
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,417
I guess.

178
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:49,846
You can look.
Just be quick.

179
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,723
Okay.

180
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,288
These are like mansions.

181
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,874
Mm-hmm. And they're
just giving them away.

182
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,963
You coming?

183
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,382
Yeah, in a sec.

184
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:42,357
They're right next
to each other, but--

185
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:45,110
They took our weapons
and now they're splitting us up.

186
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,321
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

187
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,408
We'll all be staying
in the same house tonight.

188
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,787
( thumping, wood creaking )

189
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,432
( thumping )

190
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:21,998
( Michonne sighs )

191
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,167
How long was I in there for?

192
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,003
Rick:
20 minutes.

193
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,589
God, I could not stop brushing.

194
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,470
Huh.

195
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,097
I've never--

196
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:39,015
I've never seen
your face like that.

197
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:42,352
That's what I felt
before and after.

198
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,772
Look...

199
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,775
I get why we're playing it safe.

200
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,527
We should.

201
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,155
I just--

202
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,451
I have a good feeling
about this place.

203
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,747
Well, I hope you're right.

204
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,332
Yeah, me, too.

205
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,626
( knocking )

206
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,714
Rick, I--

207
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,134
- Wow.
- ( groans )

208
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:17,137
I didn't know
what was under there.

209
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,973
Listen, I don't
mean to interrupt.

210
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,809
I just wanted to stop by
and see how you were all settling.

211
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,355
Oh, my.

212
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,859
Staying together.

213
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,360
Smart.

214
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,321
Rick:
No one said we couldn't.

215
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:37,491
You said you're a family.
That's what you said.

216
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,703
Absolutely amazing
to me how people

217
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,663
with completely
different backgrounds

218
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,625
and nothing in common
can become that.

219
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,668
Don't you think?

220
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,546
Everybody said
you gave them jobs.

221
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,590
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

222
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:56,051
Part of this place.

223
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:58,804
Looks like the communists
won after all.

224
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,598
Well, you didn't give me one.

225
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,642
I have.

226
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,020
I just haven't told you yet.

227
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,396
Same with Michonne.

228
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,818
I'm closing in on
something for Sasha.

229
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:17,823
And I'm just trying
to figure Mr. Dixon out, but I will.

230
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,535
You look good.

231
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,802
If this is how
you're saying it is...

232
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,432
then this is what we wanted.

233
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,603
We're ready for this.

234
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:32,564
Deanna:
All of you?

235
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,774
( sighs )

236
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,444
All of us.

237
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,283
Rick:
They said explore.

238
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,243
Let's explore.

239
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,329
Nah, I'll stay.

240
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,333
All right.

241
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,759
Lori and me,

242
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:04,012
we used to drive through
neighborhoods like this.

243
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,599
Thinking, "One day..."

244
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,478
Well, here we are.

245
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,026
We'll be back.

246
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:21,321
- Come on. Come on.
- ( laughing )

247
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:47,639
( clatters )

248
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,140
Rick, you okay?

249
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,642
Did Carl
and Judith walk by?

250
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,186
We were out and they
were ahead of me.

251
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,605
It's okay. I think I know
where they are.

252
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,069
That's Natalie and Bob Miller.

253
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,989
They had five kids
and 12 grandkids.

254
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,492
It's been a long time
since anyone around here

255
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,744
has seen a baby.

256
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,871
She's gonna have to put up
with some pinched cheeks.

257
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,457
Thanks.
I just, um--

258
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,043
It's okay.
I get it.

259
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:26,553
Look, I'm sorry I broke
whatever that was I broke.

260
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:29,389
It's a sculpture
I'm making with the boys.

261
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:30,724
It's an owl.

262
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,892
I mean, it will be.

263
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,061
I just can't get the eyes right.

264
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:37,272
Right, the eyes.

265
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,940
You didn't even get
a good look at it.

266
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,359
( sighs )

267
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,737
I was in the middle
of losing my mind.

268
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,905
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

269
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,410
Hey, Rick.

270
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:53,121
Would it be okay
if Carl came over now?

271
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,206
Ron really wants
to meet him.

272
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:02,505
Ron: We're almost always
here after school,

273
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:03,965
so you can come by any time.

274
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:05,925
You go to school?

275
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,094
It's in a garage.

276
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:11,264
Little kids go in the morning
and then it's us in the afternoon.

277
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:12,849
Probably you, too, right?

278
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:15,101
Probably.

279
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:18,188
Guys, this is Carl.

280
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:21,357
Carl, this is Mikey and Enid.

281
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,610
Hey.

282
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:25,236
Hi.

283
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,155
Enid's from outside, too.

284
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,699
She just came
eight months ago.

285
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,827
Oh, um...

286
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,163
is this yours?

287
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:36,998
Sorry.

288
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,375
We didn't know you guys
got that house.

289
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:42,087
We mostly just hang out there
and listen to music.

290
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,505
That's Enid's.

291
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:50,887
Wanna play
some video games?

292
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:53,056
Or Mikey's house
has a pool table,

293
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:55,975
but his dad's
kind of strict about it, so...

294
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,394
It's okay.
He's at work.

295
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,441
Um...

296
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:10,824
Sorry, I guess we
come on kind of strong.

297
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,243
We can just hang out.

298
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,537
Mikey: You don't even have to talk
if you don't wanna.

299
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:19,457
Ron: Yeah, took Enid three
weeks to say something.

300
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,753
Pull it together, sport.

301
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,675
Let's, um--

302
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:30,510
let's play some video games.

303
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,930
Ron:
Cool, yeah.

304
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:37,142
This is the kind of place
my mom wanted for us.

305
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,478
Deanna:
I'm sorry you lost her.

306
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,691
I didn't just lose her.

307
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:48,027
I killed her.

308
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,073
It had to be me.

309
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,367
Hey.

310
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,787
How was Ron's house?

311
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:01,124
What do you think of this place?

312
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,253
Well, I think it seems...

313
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,548
nice.

314
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,341
Yeah.

315
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,552
I like it here.

316
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,761
I like the people.

317
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,723
But they're weak.

318
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:20,018
And I don't want us
to get weak, too.

319
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:23,479
Hmm.

320
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,174
Deanna hasn't
given me a job yet.

321
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:53,134
You want one?

322
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,804
Yeah.

323
00:25:57,932 --> 00:25:59,557
Do you?

324
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:02,143
That's signing the papers.

325
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:05,813
That's saying yes,
this is how it is.

326
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,440
You afraid to do that?

327
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:09,859
Are you?

328
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:12,153
No.

329
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,991
So then why
are we both awake?

330
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,460
I'm gonna take a walk.

331
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:44,602
Man:
You're Rick.

332
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,234
Yeah.

333
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:54,821
My wife cut your hair.

334
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:58,658
Yeah.

335
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,164
Welcome to Alexandria.

336
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:31,858
I did laundry,
gardened, um...

337
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:34,360
always had dinner
on the table for Ed

338
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,029
when he came home.

339
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,573
Um...

340
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:42,994
I miss that stupid,
wonderful man every day.

341
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,415
You know, I really didn't have much
to offer this group,

342
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,876
so I think I just sort of
became their den mother.

343
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:52,587
And they've been
nice enough to protect me.

344
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,966
Deanna: Where do you think
you'll fit in?

345
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:59,927
Oh, um, hmm.

346
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,723
Well, I'd like to be involved
in the community.

347
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:05,725
Do you have anything
like a Junior League?

348
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:08,061
I'm a real people person.

349
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:11,731
Ow.

350
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:13,941
( door opens )

351
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,739
Time to punch the clock
and make the casseroles.

352
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:21,240
What?

353
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,117
Make dinner
for the older people--

354
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:26,412
moms who need a break,
people who can't cook.

355
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,664
Get to meet a lot
of the neighbors that way.

356
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:31,042
( scoffs )
All right.

357
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,835
Have you taken a shower yet?

358
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,962
Mm-hmm.

359
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,131
Take a shower.
I'm gonna wash that vest.

360
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,467
We need to keep up
appearances, even you.

361
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,260
Hey, I ain't starting now.

362
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,388
I'm gonna hose you
down in your sleep.

363
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:47,475
You look ridiculous.

364
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:49,811
We need to make this work.

365
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,189
Deanna:
Why?

366
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:57,110
'Cause...

367
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,905
we were almost
out there too long.

368
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:26,699
Glenn, Tara, Noah?

369
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,076
Nice to meet you.
I'm Aiden.

370
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,870
You met Nicholas
pulling gate duty.

371
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:32,538
- Nicholas: Hey.
- You're Deanna's son?

372
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:35,875
That's right. I hear you got experience
making supply runs.

373
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:37,835
I saw your pantry.

374
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,003
You guys seem to do pretty well.

375
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:42,590
Yeah, well, had some training
before this. ROTC.

376
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:45,259
Was nearing lieutenant
when this shit blew in.

377
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:48,638
- My dad did ROTC.
- He didn't make it?

378
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,682
Nah.

379
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:54,810
I'm sorry.

380
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:58,481
I'm sorry a lot these days.

381
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:00,691
Come on,
I'll show you the ropes.

382
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,777
We're doing a run today?

383
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,738
Just a dry run.

384
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:09,200
Show you the terrain outside
the walls, see how you do.

385
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,577
Weigh each other's sack
a little, you know?

386
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:15,206
No, I don't, but cool.

387
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,375
- What about weapons?
- Oh, yeah.

388
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:21,170
We pulled out some sweet-ass
biscuits for today.

389
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,206
( distant metal clanging )

390
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,401
- ( metal clanging )
- ( snarling )

391
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:46,839
( snarling )

392
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,535
( walkers snarling )

393
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,533
Get ready.

394
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,221
Dad.

395
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:39,744
Aiden: We've been increasing
our radius mile by mile,

396
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,955
spreading in a semicircle
around the town.

397
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:46,792
Nicholas: We've made it
53 miles out so far.

398
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,962
Aiden: We break into two groups
when we step outside our vehicle.

399
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,256
If shit hits, we fire a flare.

400
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,592
One group gets the other.

401
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,469
Noah:
Good system.

402
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,888
It is.

403
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,682
Still, you're standing here
because we lost four people last month.

404
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,851
What happened?

405
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:07,521
Aiden: We were on a run,
roamers came out,

406
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:08,856
they didn't follow the system.

407
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:11,567
They were good people.

408
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:13,903
They were.

409
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,572
They were just scared.

410
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:20,743
Look, I can be a hard-ass.

411
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:23,579
And I know I'm a douchebag.

412
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:25,831
Someone's got to call
the ball around here

413
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:28,375
and that someone is me.

414
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,754
If you're on this crew,
you do exactly as I say.

415
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,465
Sorry you lost your people.

416
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:37,885
Yeah.
We got ours.

417
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:42,181
Managed to snag one of the deadheads
that took them down.

418
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,016
Strung it up there.

419
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:47,144
What? Why?

420
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,438
Now we have a little pregame ritual.

421
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,732
Get our heads on straight.

422
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,943
Remind us what we're up against.

423
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,195
( flies buzzing )

424
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:58,656
Son of a bitch!

425
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:00,282
Help me find it.

426
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,535
Look at this shit.

427
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:05,329
Blood's still wet.
It's nearby.

428
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:07,706
- ( whistles )
- Shh!

429
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,709
Hey-- hey, hey.
It's gone.

430
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,336
It took down
one of our friends.

431
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,171
It's nearby,
we're not letting it go.

432
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,006
( whistles )

433
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,425
- ( clapping ) Hey!
- ( snarling )

434
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,095
Hey, over here.
Come on. Come on.

435
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:23,722
Hey, come on.
Come at me.

436
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,850
- No, don't touch it.
- The rest of you, back off.

437
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,393
Come on. Come on.
Come here.

438
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:30,896
Come on. Come on.
Come on now. Come on!

439
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:34,650
Get him.

440
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:36,902
Damn it!

441
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:45,619
Aiden:
No, hold on to it!

442
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:54,628
- What the hell?!
- Yeah, what the hell?

443
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:57,256
- You almost got her killed!
- I told you all to stay back!

444
00:36:57,424 --> 00:37:00,217
I told you to listen
to every damn thing I said.

445
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,052
I told you that.

446
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:15,733
You three need new gigs.

447
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:18,736
You're not ready for runs yet.

448
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:21,864
Yeah, pretty sure
you got that backwards.

449
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:24,450
Hey. Hey.

450
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:27,953
Look, we got a way
of doing things around here.

451
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:31,123
- You tied up walkers.
- It killed our friend.

452
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,084
Look, I'm not having
this conversation.

453
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,836
You obey my orders out there.

454
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:38,130
Then we're just as screwed
as your last run crew.

455
00:37:43,637 --> 00:37:44,970
Say that again.

456
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:46,805
Tara:
No, back off, Aiden.

457
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,350
- Come on.
- Come on, man. Just take a step back.

458
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,560
Come on, tough guy.

459
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:53,646
No one's impressed, man.

460
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,189
Walk away.

461
00:37:55,357 --> 00:37:57,650
Deanna: Aiden!
What is going on?

462
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,235
This guy's got a problem
with the way we do things.

463
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:05,157
Why did you let these people in?

464
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:07,451
Because we actually know
what we're doing out there.

465
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,371
Aiden, no!
That's enough!

466
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:14,041
Deanna:
I said that is enough!

467
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:15,709
Whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, hey!

468
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:17,920
- Let's not do this now.
- Tell him.

469
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:20,339
You want to end up
on your ass again?

470
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:22,508
- Aiden: Cool, all right?
- Rick: Daryl.

471
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:25,970
( coughing )

472
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:34,228
I want everyone
to hear me, okay?

473
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:37,398
Rick and his people are part
of this community now

474
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,693
in all ways as equals.

475
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,824
Understood?

476
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:51,203
Understood.

477
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:56,875
All of you,
turn in your weapons.

478
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,169
Then you two come talk to me.

479
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:11,557
I told you I had a job for you.

480
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:13,851
I'd like you to be our constable.

481
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,063
That's what you were.

482
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:22,317
That's what you are.

483
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:28,657
And you, too.

484
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,372
Will you accept?

485
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,461
Okay.

486
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:43,756
Yeah, I'm in.

487
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,924
( scoffs )

488
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:52,765
Thank you.

489
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:54,975
For what?

490
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:57,936
For knocking him on his ass.

491
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,120
You don't like me, do you?

492
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:23,045
Rick: You should keep
your gates closed.

493
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:25,297
Deanna: Why?

494
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,928
Because it's all about
survival now.

495
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:33,430
At any cost.

496
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:39,478
People out there are always
looking for an angle.

497
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:41,980
Looking to play
on your weakness.

498
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:45,984
They measure you

499
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:49,446
by what they can take from you,

500
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:52,282
by how they can use you to live.

501
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:07,923
We good?

502
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:09,716
Yeah.

503
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,218
You a cop again?

504
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:13,971
( sighs )

505
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:16,181
I'm trying it on for size.

506
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,312
So we're staying?

507
00:41:23,857 --> 00:41:27,192
I think we can start
sleeping in our own homes.

508
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,070
Settle in.

509
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:33,282
If we get comfortable here,
we let our guard down--

510
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:36,827
this place is gonna
make us weak.

511
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:39,496
Carl said that.

512
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,415
But it's not gonna happen.

513
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:51,216
We won't get weak.

514
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,845
That's not in us anymore.

515
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,058
We'll make it work.

516
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:05,189
And if they can't make it...

517
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,277
then we'll just take this place.

518
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:24,583
( theme music playing )
