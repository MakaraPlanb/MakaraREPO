1
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:06,297
( crickets chirping )

2
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:38,496
( birds chirping )

3
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:41,416
No, no, it's cool.
I'm usually up.

4
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,126
I used to open
for a coffee shop

5
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,962
every day for seven years.

6
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:50,842
Your brain, it gets wired
to things you don't need anymore.

7
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:54,554
I still like carrying around
my cell phone, too.

8
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:58,349
One of these days it's gonna ring
and freak my ass out.

9
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:01,728
Hey, if you happen to bag a boar
out there, can I have a leg?

10
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,897
To make a prosciutto.

11
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,526
I used to cure meats in my basement
even before all this.

12
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:10,820
I made some
kick-ass pickles, too.

13
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,572
Sure, Olivia.

14
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,871
Thanks.

15
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,351
( glass shatters )

16
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:03,831
( glass shatters )

17
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,098
( glass shatters )

18
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,227
( breathing heavily )

19
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,398
( crow cawing, echoes )

20
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,486
( glass shattering )

21
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:38,574
( walkers snarling,
echoing )

22
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,496
- ( snarling stops )
- ( heart beating )

23
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,925
( sighs )

24
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,809
Come and get me.

25
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,940
( theme music playing )

26
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,436
- ( leaves rustling )
- ( crow cawing )

27
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:50,688
( walker snarling )

28
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,320
I don't see it, but it's close.

29
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,947
There's just one of 'em.

30
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,908
We won't be here long.

31
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,493
- So what do you think?
- We can go in when it's empty.

32
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,704
Well, how is that?
It's locked up at night.

33
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:07,955
The window.
There's just a latch.

34
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,373
I can leave it open.

35
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,668
- A latch?
- Yeah.

36
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,545
What if one of those pricks
shuts it?

37
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,465
Wait a couple of days,
leave it open again.

38
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,467
- ( walker snarling )
- It's getting closer.

39
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:21,469
We need to do it
sooner than later.

40
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:22,845
Right now,
they're not watching us.

41
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,723
Not worrying about
meetings like this.

42
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,975
We may need the guns,
we may not.

43
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,061
We will
whatever way it goes.

44
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,272
They're the luckiest
damn people I ever met.

45
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,982
And they just keep
getting luckier.

46
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,400
How's that?

47
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,486
We're here now.

48
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,240
They've got a couple
of footlockers

49
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,369
just full of 9 millimeter autos,
Rugers, Kel-Tecs.

50
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,788
Just tossed in there.
They don't use them.

51
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,706
They're never gonna know
they're gone.

52
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,084
Someone's got one now, right?

53
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,003
Mmm.

54
00:04:56,171 --> 00:05:00,049
Listen, the others,
we want them to try.

55
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,592
You, too.

56
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,346
So we keep it quiet.
Just us.

57
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,598
- ( walker snarling )
- Here it comes.

58
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,267
- I got him.
- Hey, wait.

59
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:23,572
We said we were
taking me out shooting.

60
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,033
I couldn't go back
with a full mag.

61
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,952
Lucky he came by.

62
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,954
We should get back.

63
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:34,417
You'll pull the latch,
we'll pick our moment.

64
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,169
Us, we don't need
to be lucky.

65
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,339
What the hell's that?

66
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:43,843
Is that a W?

67
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,803
Carol:
Yeah.

68
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:05,489
( sighs )

69
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,841
( sighs )

70
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,515
I don't know if this
is some kind of play,

71
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:34,226
handing authority
to strangers.

72
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,937
The authority
to break up fistfights.

73
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,316
Well, if it was just that, she should
have given one of these to Daryl.

74
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,404
I don't know if it's for us
or for them.

75
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:49,325
Or maybe Deanna's trying
to get rid of us and them.

76
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:52,244
You put these jackets
on me and you,

77
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,914
have the people see it.

78
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,541
If that's the play,
that'd be smart.

79
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,212
And she seems smart.

80
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,257
Smart for then
or smart for now?

81
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,053
This is now.

82
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,150
( leaves rustling )

83
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,944
Come out!

84
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,071
Now!

85
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:42,086
You can tell the difference between
walkers and humans by sound?

86
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,970
Can you tell the difference between
a good guy and a bad guy?

87
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,431
Rick doesn't seem
to be an expert at that.

88
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,933
There ain't much
of a difference no more.

89
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,685
That how you feel
about your people?

90
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:00,104
Why you following me?

91
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,648
I didn't know I was.

92
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,859
I came out to hunt rabbits.

93
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,446
I know why you're out here.

94
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,325
Mind if I join?

95
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,707
Keep up.

96
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,917
And keep quiet.

97
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,298
Deanna:
You protect and serve.

98
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,384
You patrol, walk the wall,
watch out for the kids.

99
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:33,470
If there's a conflict,
you solve it.

100
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,015
And people will listen to you.

101
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,683
Because we're wearing
windbreakers?

102
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,227
Because they believe in this.

103
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,688
Because I'm telling them to.

104
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:46,525
A police officer used to live here.

105
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:50,237
So we had these jackets
and I wanted to make it official.

106
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:51,989
So it's official.

107
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,825
There's gonna be
a government here one day.

108
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:58,329
That's why I want
Maggie working with me.

109
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,749
There's gonna be a police force.
That's why I want you two to start it.

110
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:06,670
I see a vibrant community here
with industry,

111
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:10,216
commerce, civilization.

112
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,427
Real lives.

113
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:17,014
It might be horses
and mills, but-- what?

114
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,850
Does that sound like
pie in the sky?

115
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,852
No.

116
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,022
No.

117
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,526
No.

118
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,528
Can we talk security?

119
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,698
We need a constant patrol
along the walls.

120
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,284
Not just looking for damage,

121
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,536
but signs that anyone
climbed in from outside.

122
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,917
You can move
right up the supports.

123
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,336
That's what I'd do.

124
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,213
People are the real threat now.

125
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:52,466
Rick, I know you think that we should
all be armed within the walls.

126
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,636
I-- I can't do that.

127
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,973
That's fine.

128
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,892
You make these changes,
we won't need to.

129
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,395
Sasha:
Excuse me.

130
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,110
I want to volunteer to be
one of the lookouts in the clock tower.

131
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,903
There are no lookouts
in the clock tower.

132
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,364
- What?
- We saw someone up there earlier.

133
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:19,285
That was an empty rifle
my son Spencer put up there.

134
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,288
He mans it sometimes,
but not often.

135
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,249
Look, there hasn't
been the need.

136
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:29,586
We need a lookout in that tower
right now, 24/7.

137
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,755
It's the only way we'll be able to see
if someone's coming at us.

138
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,257
Okay, okay, we'll make shifts.

139
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:36,427
I'll take those shifts,
as many as possible.

140
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:39,221
Why?

141
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,558
Sasha's one of our best shots.

142
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:43,934
She can do it.

143
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,981
I'm gonna put Spencer
up there today.

144
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,775
I'll consider you being
our primary lookout,

145
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,944
but I want something
in return.

146
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:59,158
Tonight I'm hosting a welcome

147
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:02,745
for all of you at my home.

148
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,997
I want you to be there.

149
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,623
Why?

150
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,377
Come tonight.
Then we'll talk about it.

151
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:16,800
Mashed lima beans, cocoa powder,
a little sweetener.

152
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:19,845
I would have eaten it
before all this, I swear.

153
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,513
It's protein and it fills you up.

154
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,891
Sounds delicious.

155
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:26,477
I'll be back.

156
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,812
I've got to go beg Rick
for some help with tonight.

157
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,647
You need anything else,
you hit me, girl.

158
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,691
Okay, thanks.

159
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,280
You've heard about the party?

160
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,865
Everyone's gonna be there.

161
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,242
That's right.

162
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,411
So tonight, then.

163
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:47,414
Should be able to slip out.

164
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,291
The armory
is right next to Deanna's.

165
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,293
I'll back you up.

166
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,629
People might wonder
where their new constable is

167
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,798
or Carl's dad.

168
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,508
Okay.

169
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,468
We can't use Daryl.

170
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,845
They're watching
every move he makes.

171
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,472
It's fine.

172
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,058
You know what's great
about this place?

173
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,352
I get to be invisible again.

174
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,657
( horse nickers )

175
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,042
( nickers )

176
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,379
I've been trying
to catch him for months,

177
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:36,964
bring him inside.

178
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,633
His name is Buttons.

179
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,721
One of the kids saw him
run by the gate a while back.

180
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,348
Thought he looked
like a Buttons.

181
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,102
I haven't seen him for a while.

182
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,563
I was afraid it was too late.

183
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:59,486
Every time Eric or I come close,
he gets spooked.

184
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,532
Have you done this before?

185
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,409
My group did.

186
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,786
But they weren't
out there that long.

187
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,080
The longer they're out there,

188
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,749
the more they become
what they really are.

189
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,597
I ain't gonna hurt ya.

190
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,682
All right?

191
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,642
Come on, boy.

192
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,561
Yeah.

193
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,938
Just keep on eating.

194
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,857
Yeah.
( clicks tongue )

195
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,859
Good boy.

196
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,862
Yeah, you used to be
somebody's, huh?

197
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:45,282
- Now you're just yours.
- ( twig snaps )

198
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,783
- ( nickers )
- ( walkers snarling )

199
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:47,951
Shit!

200
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,789
( neighs )

201
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,628
- Come on, they're coming!
- ( silenced gunshot )

202
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,059
Come on.

203
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,522
You really substitute
applesauce for eggs?

204
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,524
That could change my life.

205
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,234
If we can keep that
between you and me.

206
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,277
It's sort of the secret
to these cookies.

207
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:25,155
- Are you serious?
- I am.

208
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,115
A girl's got
only so many secrets.

209
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,867
It'll die with me.

210
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,620
Uh, the chocolate
is kind of a trick.

211
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,080
You actually have it?

212
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:34,957
I can only ration you
a quarter bar.

213
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,000
I'll make it work.

214
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,211
Hey, Olivia.

215
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,671
We're gonna need to make
a withdrawal.

216
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:41,838
Late start?

217
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:45,133
Boss lady wants me to check that strut
on the east wall before the party.

218
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,135
Head on back.

219
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,221
Carol, just grab
what you need.

220
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,932
- Chocolate's in the hall freezer.
- Okay.

221
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,909
You afraid of guns, ma'am?

222
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,287
Mm, no, I...

223
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,039
well, I had a handgun
and I carried a rifle

224
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:19,418
when we were on the outside,
but I'm not an expert.

225
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,921
Not with those, at least.

226
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,675
Well, my name is Tobin.

227
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:30,804
And whenever you want,
I'd be happy to teach you.

228
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:34,683
It's better to be safe than sorry.

229
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:37,019
That'd be nice.
Thanks, Tobin.

230
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,563
- Thank you, Olivia.
- Mm-hmm.

231
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,366
You ride horses?

232
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,452
I ride bikes.

233
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,789
I take it you don't mean
10-speeds.

234
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,170
I know you're feeling
like an outsider.

235
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,133
It's not your fault, you know.

236
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,427
Eric and I,

237
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,597
we're still looked at as outsiders
in a lot of ways.

238
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,727
We've heard our fair share
of well-meaning,

239
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,772
but hilariously
offensive things

240
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,441
from some otherwise
really nice men and women.

241
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,862
People are people.

242
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,698
The more afraid they get,
the more stupid they get.

243
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,619
Fear shrinks the brain.

244
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:41,291
They're scared of you and me
for different reasons.

245
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,379
They're less scared of me
because they know me.

246
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:49,299
It's less and less every day.

247
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:54,554
So let them get to know you.

248
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,308
You should go
to Deanna's party tonight.

249
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,727
I got nothing to prove.

250
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:07,901
I met a lot of bad people out here
doing a lot of bad shit.

251
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,028
They weren't afraid of nothing.

252
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,157
Yeah, they were.

253
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:17,244
- ( music playing )
- ( people chatting, laughing )

254
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,545
Oh, my.

255
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,213
Welcome.

256
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,715
Hi.

257
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,383
Oh, it's so good to see you.

258
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,678
Hi, Carl.
Thank you for coming.

259
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:38,390
You know, I didn't get a chance
to interview this one.

260
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,434
- I envy her.
- Rick: Why?

261
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,019
She'll get to see
what this place will become.

262
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,480
Come.
Come on in.

263
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,877
I don't know about this.

264
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,047
They have beer.

265
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,427
I'm gonna try.

266
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,229
You're Rick.

267
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:28,899
Rick, this is my husband Reg.

268
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,401
You're a pretty remarkable guy.

269
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,153
Well, how's that?

270
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:36,239
I watched the tapes,
all of them.

271
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,200
The things those people
said about you.

272
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,743
The things you did for them.

273
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,538
Didn't you build
that wall out there?

274
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,874
( chuckles )
Yeah, I did, with help.

275
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,209
A lot of it.

276
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,253
And it's a damned incredible
achievement.

277
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:53,089
But it's a wall.

278
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,258
( Deanna chuckles )

279
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:59,596
14 lives in this world?

280
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,223
I think you have me beat.

281
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,267
Well, we're standing
behind that wall right now, dear.

282
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:06,144
So let's call it a tie.

283
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,063
( chuckles )

284
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:10,607
Well, I'm glad you're here.

285
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,776
Now, take a glass.

286
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:15,070
I'm good.

287
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:17,155
You don't have to be.

288
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,246
( laughs )
There you go.

289
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,206
Go on.

290
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,961
Right. Welcome.

291
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,296
- Thank you.
- ( door opens )

292
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,684
( walkers snarling )

293
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:52,023
Gotta move quick.
He's pinned in with them.

294
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,820
I got the far ones.

295
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:04,995
- ( snarling )
- ( groans )

296
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,675
Thanks.

297
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,392
Thanks.

298
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,355
( whinnies )

299
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:36,067
- ( walkers snarling )
- ( whinnying )

300
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:54,544
I got the ones on the right.

301
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,018
Go ahead.

302
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:13,980
( horse breathing heavily )

303
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,916
( sighs )
He always ran.

304
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:43,551
You were trying to help him.

305
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:55,647
- ( music playing )
- ( people chatting )

306
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:03,363
- Hey.
- Hey.

307
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:06,282
Hey.
Are you okay?

308
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,118
Yeah.

309
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:11,955
Yeah, um, just isn't
really my thing.

310
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,960
- I think I'm gonna head out.
- No, no.

311
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:18,837
You're not bailing.

312
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,047
We're in this together, man.

313
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:22,966
Maggie:
You're here with us now.

314
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,635
You're here with family.

315
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,807
Come on.

316
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,118
Daryl.

317
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,037
Hey.

318
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,372
Thought you were going
to that party over there.

319
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:59,502
Oh, I was never going to go
'cause of Eric's ankle, thank God.

320
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,671
Why the hell did you
tell me to go, then?

321
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,591
I said try.
You did.

322
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:07,302
It's a thought
that counts thing.

323
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:11,056
- All right.
- Hey, come in.

324
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,807
Have some dinner.

325
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:17,062
Come on, man.

326
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,981
It's some pretty serious
spaghetti.

327
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:21,649
( door opens )

328
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:29,657
Look, she's here,
which means it's empty, so...

329
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,201
I'll go with you.

330
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,453
No, remember...

331
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:35,997
- You're invisible.
- Mm-hmm.

332
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:39,292
Hey, Rick,
this is my husband Pete.

333
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,669
Hey, good to meet you.

334
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,380
I wanted to thank you
for taking on being our constable.

335
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,716
If we keep growing at this rate,
we're gonna need even more.

336
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:48,384
Well, I hope so.

337
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,803
You want to come by my office
next week?

338
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,763
I'll take a look at you.

339
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:55,225
And I probably should have said
I was a doctor first.

340
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,768
I think it sounded nice
either way.

341
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:59,562
I'm going to get us a refill.

342
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,606
- Oh, I can-- I can do it.
- I'm on it.

343
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:06,736
Having fun?

344
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,657
Yes, I am.

345
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,410
That's kind of
a stupid question, right?

346
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,663
( chuckles )
No.

347
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:22,836
Still, this place has
a pretty amazing view.

348
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,462
Yeah?

349
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,215
Yeah, take a look.

350
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:35,890
Ordinary life like before.

351
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,644
Well, not like before.

352
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,271
No.

353
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:44,149
( sighs )
Yeah, no.

354
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,359
I mean--
I mean, it's better.

355
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:48,444
Not out there, in here.

356
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:53,950
You know, everyone's been
through it somehow.

357
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:56,452
Everyone.

358
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,372
And a lot of things disappeared.

359
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,000
But a lot of bullshit
went with it.

360
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:08,631
They're all from totally different
backgrounds, different places.

361
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,133
They never
would have even met.

362
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:14,679
And now they're part
of each other's lives.

363
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,931
They are each other's lives.

364
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:23,313
I'm just saying,
we all lost things,

365
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,732
but we got something back.

366
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:30,862
It isn't enough,
but it's something.

367
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,533
Carl:
No, it was a tie, man.

368
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,577
You saw it, right?

369
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,209
( Jessie chuckles )

370
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:48,588
Yeah, yeah,
it's a pretty good view.

371
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:52,800
Sam:
Mom.

372
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,469
- Yeah?
- There's no more cookies.

373
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:56,137
- Jessie: Oh.
- Rick: Well, oh--

374
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,723
well, I happen to know
the cookie maker.

375
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,433
She's a good friend
of mine.

376
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:04,771
And I might be able to see about her
making a whole batch just for you.

377
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:06,689
Mom, he doesn't have a stamp.

378
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:08,524
Oh.

379
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,276
Do you want a stamp?

380
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:12,278
Sure.

381
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:22,538
See? Now you're
officially one of us.

382
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,624
Yeah.

383
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:27,835
- Ron: Hey, Sam.
- Sam, wait, don't run.

384
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,840
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

385
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:48,064
( knocking )

386
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,195
Trying to make a getaway, huh?

387
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,990
I can pretend I didn't make it.

388
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:02,036
I'm Sasha.

389
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:06,749
I'm Spencer.
Deanna's my mom.

390
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:10,086
Your mom...

391
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,504
she seems nice.

392
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:12,880
Well, if you want
to hang with me,

393
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,633
I'll make sure you don't get stuck
with Mrs. Neudermyer.

394
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:19,762
She really, really likes talking about
how much she wants a pasta maker.

395
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,433
It's not a conversation
you want to have.

396
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,601
Excuse me.

397
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,442
( slurping )

398
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,951
( grunts )
Thanks.

399
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,456
Mmm, when you're out there,

400
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,916
if you happen to be
in a store or something,

401
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,711
Mrs. Neudermyer is really looking
for a pasta maker.

402
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:54,630
And we're all really trying
to get her to shut up about it.

403
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,717
I mean, we have crates
of dried pasta in here,

404
00:27:57,885 --> 00:28:00,428
but she wants to make her own
or something.

405
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:03,556
I really think she just wants
something to talk about, so...

406
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:06,309
if you see one
out on your travels,

407
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,728
it would go a long way to...

408
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,778
I thought it was done.

409
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,821
You didn't ask him already?

410
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,910
Ask me what?

411
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,593
When I got the place,
there was that frame

412
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,261
and some parts and equipment.

413
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:45,014
Whoever lived here built them.

414
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:49,519
- It's a lot of parts for one bike.
- Yeah.

415
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,354
Whenever I came across
any parts out there,

416
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:53,064
I brought them back.

417
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,358
I didn't know what I'd need.

418
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:58,027
I always thought
I'd learn how to do it,

419
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:01,864
but I get the feeling...

420
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:03,991
you already know
what to do with it.

421
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,329
And the thing is...

422
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:09,705
you're going to need a bike.

423
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,460
Why?

424
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:19,132
I told Deanna
not to give you a job

425
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:23,886
because I think
I have one for you.

426
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:29,100
I'd like you to be
Alexandria's other recruiter.

427
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,811
I don't want Eric
risking his life anymore.

428
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,649
You want me
risking mine, right?

429
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:40,027
Yeah, because you know
what you're doing.

430
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,196
You're good out there.

431
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:45,032
But you don't belong out there.

432
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,287
I know it's hard getting used
to people getting used to you.

433
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:53,458
And I understand right now
you need to be out there sometimes.

434
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,126
So do I.

435
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:03,551
But the main reason
why I want you to help me recruit

436
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:06,929
is because you do know
the difference

437
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:09,765
between a good person
and a bad person.

438
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:24,322
I got nothing else to do.

439
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:29,202
Thanks.

440
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,870
( silent )

441
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,165
I'll get you some rabbits.

442
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,959
( laughs )
Great.

443
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:39,170
( chatter )

444
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:41,964
( door opens )

445
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:48,471
You packing
different steel nowadays?

446
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:50,431
( chuckles )

447
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:53,351
Yeah.

448
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:57,939
Live by it, you die by it...

449
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,526
and eat potato puffs by it.

450
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,694
( chuckles )

451
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:09,492
Pray to God you don't
have to use it again.

452
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:14,163
Pray to God you don't get used
to not using it again.

453
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,710
It's on your back...

454
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,214
even when it's off your back.

455
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:27,260
Hmm.

456
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:32,431
How much
have you had to drink?

457
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,600
( both laugh )

458
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:37,603
I am a large man.

459
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:40,856
And I have had many beers
to make up for that.

460
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,317
Uh-huh.

461
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,236
And you know what?

462
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,699
By that brave act, I have--

463
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:55,663
I have come to realize that things
have worked out pretty damn well for me.

464
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,041
( chuckles )

465
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,962
How about you?

466
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,964
What have you done?

467
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:10,636
I put on this dress.

468
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,142
Try again.

469
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:53,262
Sam:
What are you doing?

470
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,895
Sam, what are you doing here?

471
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,564
I followed you.

472
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,775
I was hoping you were
going to make more cookies,

473
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:08,277
but then you came here.

474
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,489
Well, I could make more.

475
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:13,866
I could make a whole batch
just for you.

476
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,743
- Would you like that?
- Yes.

477
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:18,287
I mean, yes, please.

478
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:19,622
Okay.

479
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:23,376
But you've got to promise me
you can keep it secret that I came here.

480
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:26,128
But I'd have to tell my mom.

481
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,631
I mean, I tell my mom
everything.

482
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:33,177
You can never tell anyone,
especially your mom.

483
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:37,348
Because if you do...

484
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:41,143
one morning you'll wake up...

485
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,982
and you won't be in your bed.

486
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,276
Where will I be?

487
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:52,905
You'll be outside the walls

488
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:58,035
far, far away tied to a tree.

489
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:03,916
And you'll scream and scream
because you'll be so afraid.

490
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,753
No one will come to help

491
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:11,465
because no one will hear you.

492
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:15,553
Well, something
will hear you.

493
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,847
The monsters will come.

494
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,599
The ones out there.

495
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:25,688
And you won't be able to run away
when they come for you.

496
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:28,733
And they will tear you apart
and eat you up

497
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,736
all while you're still alive.

498
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:35,197
All while you can still feel it.

499
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,619
And then afterwards,

500
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,372
no one will ever know
what happened to you.

501
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:52,548
Or you can promise

502
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:56,719
not to ever tell anyone
what you saw here

503
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:59,138
and then nothing will happen.

504
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,017
And you'll get cookies.

505
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:05,060
Lots of cookies.

506
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,027
I know what I think
you should do.

507
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:17,364
- ( music playing )
- ( chatter )

508
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:23,829
That's a pretty good view,
too, isn't it?

509
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:30,503
It's been a long time
since I held one of these.

510
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,304
She and Carl...

511
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,016
they're why I'm still here.

512
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:49,730
And I get what
you've been telling me.

513
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,359
What's that?

514
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:57,655
Here isn't that bad.

515
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,119
( Judith fusses )

516
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,872
- Do you want to take her?
- Yeah.

517
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:49,957
Sasha.
Come join us.

518
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,834
I promise
all you have to do is listen.

519
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:54,169
Come on.

520
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,921
Okay.

521
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:04,513
Bless her heart.
I don't get what takes her so long.

522
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,056
I mean,
we only have one copy

523
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,642
and the point of book club
is that we all read the book.

524
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,978
I just keep hoping that a dentist
shows up at our gates.

525
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:12,146
It's his teeth.

526
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:14,523
I mean, it's just so much better
when it's fresh.

527
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:16,400
Woman: You know, I know how to work
one of those machines.

528
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,527
- ( heart beating )
- Woman #2: Oh, they're amazing!

529
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:22,239
- ( laughing )
- ( overlapping conversation echoing )

530
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,207
I mean, it's just so much
better when it's fresh.

531
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:35,502
( walkers snarling )

532
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,880
Sasha, honey,
what's your favorite meal?

533
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:39,298
I'd love to cook it for you
sometime.

534
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:41,759
I'm doing it
for all the new arrivals.

535
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:43,761
- I don't know.
- Of course you do.

536
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:46,889
Everyone has favorites.
So what's yours?

537
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:49,725
Whatever you want.

538
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:53,145
I'm just worried that I'll end up
cooking something you hate, you know?

539
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:54,897
You're worried?

540
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,400
That's what you worry about?!

541
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:20,130
I'm trying to figure out
what it is.

542
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,216
What it is exactly.

543
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,139
This...

544
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:35,562
it isn't real.

545
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,440
Sasha, you've been through a lot
and I accept that,

546
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:40,359
but what you just said...

547
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,071
that's bullshit.

548
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:05,134
Take your pick.

549
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,469
Look, I've been thinking.

550
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:09,471
Do we really need these?

551
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,933
I mean, things go bad,
yeah, sure.

552
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:15,811
We do what we gotta do,
but it's like you said.

553
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:17,354
We don't need these for that.

554
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,398
Right now we don't.

555
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:25,279
You wanted me to try, right?

556
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:27,322
I'm good.
