1
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:06,255
( birds chirping )

2
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,249
( chuckles )

3
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:20,747
Looks good.

4
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,086
Hi.

5
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,258
Hello.

6
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:36,596
( spoon clattering )

7
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:38,765
You can lower that.

8
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,571
What's the W for?

9
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:59,869
You know,
the first settlers here,

10
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:03,289
they put bounties
on wolves' heads.

11
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,125
Brought the natives into it.

12
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,085
Made them hunt them.

13
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,464
Didn't take them too long
to kill them all.

14
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:15,676
They're back now.

15
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,432
Thoughts?

16
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,229
Everything gets a return.

17
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,609
- Are you shitting me?
- No, I shit you not.

18
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:34,362
( both laughing )

19
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,115
I like this.

20
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:40,910
Just talking.

21
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,411
( laughs )

22
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:47,041
I don't get to meet
new people very often.

23
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:50,503
Maybe once
every two weeks.

24
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,214
- That's a lot.
- Oh, I work at it.

25
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,925
We do.

26
00:02:56,093 --> 00:03:00,429
Sometimes we find camps.
We run through them.

27
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,431
But we have traps, too.

28
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:07,854
It's different.
It's not like meeting like this.

29
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,357
As equals.

30
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:16,737
Little chats in front of a fire
with a stranger.

31
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,449
That's the closest thing
to movies now.

32
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,953
I miss the movies.

33
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,663
I used to-- put that down.

34
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:28,624
Why?

35
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,376
'Cause I want it.

36
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:34,255
I want everything you have.

37
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,258
Every last drop.

38
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,136
Can I keep a little of it?

39
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:41,596
Just to get me through
a day or two?

40
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,307
You know,
just to keep me alive?

41
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,810
I'm taking you, too.

42
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:52,648
And you're not exactly
gonna be alive.

43
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,819
Okay.

44
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,368
Some of the tribes
around here,

45
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:10,249
they thought that the first people
were wolves transformed into men.

46
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,003
And now...

47
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,672
well, you know.

48
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,134
Everything gets
a return, right?

49
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,599
You can have my supplies.
You can have everything.

50
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,269
Doesn't need
to be any ugliness.

51
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,607
But I can't allow you
to take me away.

52
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:38,402
I will not allow that.

53
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,742
Don't move.

54
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,995
( sighs )

55
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:54,168
Just be still.

56
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,715
Just be still.

57
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,892
( grunts )

58
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,445
Morgan:
You should just go now.

59
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,114
No.

60
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,502
Just go.

61
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,592
Please.

62
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,390
Now!

63
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,778
( snarling )

64
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,614
( clicks )

65
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,618
( clicking )

66
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:35,478
( honks horn )

67
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,826
( theme music playing )

68
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,504
( groans )

69
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,900
( chuckles )

70
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,862
( groans )

71
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,908
Michonne:
What's so funny?

72
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,953
You were here
the whole time?

73
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,497
All night.

74
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,166
What's so funny?

75
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,380
It's-- it's like the train car.

76
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,636
After the whole thing,

77
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,679
I'm still there.

78
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:21,435
Deanna wanted you in here,
calm things down.

79
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,980
Rosita patched you up.

80
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,690
Carl came by for a while.

81
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,484
I sent him home.

82
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,657
Rick.

83
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,120
What are you doing?

84
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,706
( sighs )

85
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,505
We put Pete
in another house.

86
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,133
You could have told me
what was happening.

87
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,010
It moved fast.

88
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,096
And then Noah.

89
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,227
I couldn't tell you
about the gun.

90
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:04,812
No, you couldn't.

91
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,189
Oh, you wanted this place.

92
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,900
We had to stop being out there.

93
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:18,200
Well, we're here.

94
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:21,870
( Michonne scoffs )

95
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:25,499
Well, you just said you weren't.

96
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:29,920
( door opens )

97
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:38,387
Michonne:
Where'd you get the gun?

98
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,557
Carol: You took it, right?
From the armory?

99
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:46,395
That was stupid.
Why did you do it?

100
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,194
Just in case.

101
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,530
Glenn: Deanna's planning
to have a meeting tonight.

102
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:57,781
For anyone who wants to.

103
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,783
- To kick Rick out?
- To try.

104
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,202
We don't know that.

105
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,038
Maggie's with Deanna right now.

106
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,873
She's gonna find out what it is.

107
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,916
At the meeting,
you say you were worried

108
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,501
about someone being abused

109
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,587
and no one was doing
anything about it.

110
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:14,006
You say you took a gun
just to be sure

111
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,967
that Jessie was safe from a man
who wound up attacking you.

112
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,761
You say you'll do
whatever you want them to.

113
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,264
Just tell them a story
that they want to hear.

114
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:25,476
It's what I've been doing
since I got here.

115
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,019
Why?

116
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:30,856
Because these people are children
and children like stories.

117
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,817
What happens
after all the nice words

118
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:35,944
and they still try
to kick him out?

119
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,447
They're guarding
the armory now.

120
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,783
We still have knives.

121
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,868
That's all we'll need
against them.

122
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,206
Well, tonight at the meeting...

123
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:52,044
if it looks like it's going bad,
I whistle.

124
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:56,799
Carol grabs Deanna,
I take Spencer, you grab Reg,

125
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,301
Glenn and Abraham cover us,
watch the crowd.

126
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,679
- We can talk to them.
- Yeah, we will.

127
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,556
If we can't get through,

128
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,935
we take the three of them
and say we'll slit their throats.

129
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:09,311
Like at Terminus?

130
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,980
No, we just tell 'em.

131
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,692
They give us the armory
and it's over.

132
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,738
Did you want this?

133
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,282
No.

134
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,826
I hit my limit.

135
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,954
I-- I screwed up.

136
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,166
And here we are.

137
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:37,923
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm just gonna sleep some more.

138
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,033
Reg: Maggie, hey.
She's out on the porch.

139
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:12,207
What do you need
to talk about, Maggie?

140
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,917
The meeting tonight.

141
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,461
Maggie, if we could talk--

142
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,962
I want to talk to everyone
about what happened

143
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,547
and what we need
to do about it.

144
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:22,801
If it includes sending Rick away,
it's not gonna work.

145
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,428
Tell me what that means.

146
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:27,723
You let Rick in.
You let all of us in.

147
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:32,311
You talked to us.
You decided.

148
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,563
And now you want
to put that decision

149
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:35,898
on a group
of very frightened people

150
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,567
who might not have
the whole story.

151
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,235
That's not leadership.

152
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,654
Well, tonight is just a forum.

153
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,615
It's just for people
to say their piece.

154
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,576
And I'll make the decision
as I've done since the beginning.

155
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,329
He was frustrated.

156
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:53,749
The things he's seen.
The things he's lost.

157
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,459
The things we have all lost.

158
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:57,461
The things you've lost?

159
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,382
We've lost so much more.

160
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,469
Rick took a gun
and he pointed it at people.

161
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:06,929
He didn't pull the trigger.

162
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,598
That's a metric?
That he didn't pull the trigger?

163
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:13,936
- Yes.
- Michonne stopped him, Deanna.

164
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,479
Michonne did.

165
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,235
I'm gonna do
what I have to do, Maggie.

166
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,159
Maggie.

167
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,371
Look, Maggie.

168
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,920
The cavemen...

169
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,215
they were all nomads.

170
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:47,219
And they all died.

171
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:50,764
Then we evolved into this
and we lived.

172
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,644
Civilization starts
when we stop running.

173
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,313
When we live together.

174
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,650
When we stop
sending people away

175
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,695
from the world
and from each other.

176
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,825
That's what I'm going
to tell her.

177
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,703
That's what I'm going
to tell everyone.

178
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,162
Okay?

179
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,772
( sighs )

180
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,479
Somebody came through here
a while ago.

181
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,398
If we see them,
we hang back,

182
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:08,527
set up the mike,
watch and listen.

183
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,362
For how long?

184
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,740
Until we know.

185
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,659
We have to know.

186
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:18,245
You've sent people away?

187
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:19,913
Yeah.

188
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,625
What happened?

189
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,962
It was early on.

190
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,839
It was three people.

191
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,800
Two men and a woman.

192
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:36,388
Davidson was their leader.

193
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,807
Smart as hell, strong.

194
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,767
I thought they'd work out.

195
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,770
They didn't.

196
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,774
I brought them in
and I had to see them out.

197
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,528
So me, Aiden,
and Nicholas,

198
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:55,824
we drove them out far...

199
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:02,205
gave them a day's worth
of food and water and left them.

200
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,419
They just went?

201
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,171
We had their guns.

202
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,883
We had all the guns.

203
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,304
I can't make
that kind of mistake again.

204
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,433
Wake up.

205
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,109
It's good what happened
last night.

206
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,696
We have more cover now.

207
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:38,283
All of them think you've been
found out, that it's over.

208
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,503
Why didn't you want to tell them
we had more guns?

209
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:53,715
Michonne stopped you.
She knocked you out.

210
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,884
Well, I deserved it.

211
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,011
Well, it was stupid.

212
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:01,348
She's with us.
Glenn is.

213
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:04,559
I didn't tell them
about the guns just in case.

214
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,314
( sighs )

215
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:14,402
I don't want to lie anymore.

216
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,074
You said you don't want
to take this place.

217
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,159
And you don't want to lie?

218
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,748
Oh, sunshine,
you don't get both.

219
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:46,351
Aaron:
What's he doing?

220
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,270
Daryl:
Wild leeks.

221
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:53,275
Son of a bitch knows about
how to keep mosquitos off of him.

222
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,695
Come on.

223
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,465
Hey, Tobin.

224
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,259
Hey, Rick.

225
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,089
- You met with her?
- Yeah.

226
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,008
So what is it?

227
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,177
It's what we thought.

228
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:03,929
I'm gonna talk to people.

229
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,223
I'll talk to everyone I can
right up until.

230
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,392
I'm gonna try to solve this.

231
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:13,605
What?

232
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:21,237
What?

233
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,532
I love you.

234
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,704
We're gonna work it out.

235
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,539
I know it.

236
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,294
- I'll see you there.
- Yeah.

237
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,349
( metal rattling )

238
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,697
Sure you don't want
a gun, Father?

239
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,573
I just want a quick walk.

240
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,870
The word of God
is the only protection I need.

241
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,755
Carl:
Dad.

242
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,258
Hey.

243
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:25,593
You okay?

244
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,345
Yeah.

245
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,389
Look, I'm sorry.

246
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,266
I heard about the meeting.

247
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:33,059
You're staying home.

248
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,437
That's what it is now, right?

249
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,272
Home?

250
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:45,321
Yeah.

251
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,782
They need us.

252
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,951
They'll die without us.

253
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:57,959
I might have to threaten
one of them.

254
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:00,962
I could have
to kill one of them.

255
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,423
- You won't.
- I might.

256
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:06,760
You have to tell them.

257
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,386
I told them last night.

258
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:11,181
You have to tell them
so they can hear you.

259
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,145
I don't know if they can.

260
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:22,108
Does that make you afraid?

261
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:25,278
Just for them.

262
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:27,405
You have to tell them.

263
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,953
( walkers snarling )

264
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:44,506
We checked the forest,
we checked the roads.

265
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,425
We can't find him.

266
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:50,386
Sometimes they slip away.
It happens.

267
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,888
But...

268
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,767
you don't come across
something like this every day.

269
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:03,191
We do this now,
it means we're giving up.

270
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:08,029
Home is 50 miles back.
It's time to go.

271
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:10,698
You saw it last night.
There's bad people out here.

272
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,785
That's why we ought to keep
looking for the good ones.

273
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:18,081
We need more people
and we'll find them.

274
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:22,210
But when we do,
we'll need to feed them.

275
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,550
All right.

276
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,802
( metal ringing )

277
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,263
( snarling )

278
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,557
( flesh squelching )

279
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,503
- ( cans clanging )
- ( wind whistling )

280
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:30,111
Huh.

281
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:33,198
Whoa.

282
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,325
( chuckles )

283
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,535
Wasn't sure I'd ever
see one of these.

284
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:44,626
Hey, listen, I don't
like giving up either,

285
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:48,171
but the guy is in a red poncho.

286
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:50,798
You can see him
from a mile away.

287
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,761
We've gone a lot of miles here.

288
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:56,721
No sign of him.

289
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,643
But...

290
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,772
if we come away
with a trailer full of cans,

291
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,941
I'd say that's a good trip.

292
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:10,443
Here we go.

293
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,826
( snarling )

294
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,056
Over here!

295
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,351
Daryl:
Come on!

296
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,366
- No!
- Come on.

297
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:25,893
Come on!
Go!

298
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,088
Glass will hold for a while, right?

299
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,215
Maybe.

300
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,384
Maybe we can make it
so they can't see us.

301
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:02,847
In a couple hours,
something will come by,

302
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,099
they'll follow it out.

303
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:08,019
There's got to be something in here
we can use to block the view.

304
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,854
We can cut up these seats.

305
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,459
( knocking at door )

306
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:36,506
( knocking )

307
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,716
( sighs )

308
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,139
( knocking )

309
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:52,355
What the hell are you doing?

310
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:54,649
You need to check on Tara.

311
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:56,067
You treated her.
You're a surgeon.

312
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,318
You need to do that.

313
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,278
Get out.

314
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,119
I could kill you right now.

315
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:10,748
I could.

316
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,251
I will.

317
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:18,923
And then who would believe I did it
because I didn't like you?

318
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,633
No one.

319
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:28,433
They'd believe
you tried to hurt me.

320
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,101
Definitely believe that.

321
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,270
( gasps )

322
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,234
Come at me.

323
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,699
No?

324
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,035
Yeah?

325
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,039
No.

326
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:57,128
The way this has played out,
you have a chance.

327
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:02,717
You're here.

328
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:04,802
Your wife's there.

329
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,188
You're a small, weak nothing.

330
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:21,068
And with the world how it is,
you're even weaker.

331
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:27,909
Play your cards right,
maybe you don't have to die.

332
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:34,165
And I want my dish back clean
when you're done.

333
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:47,637
Pete:
This isn't my house.

334
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:50,389
( furniture crashes )

335
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,892
This isn't my house!

336
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:22,463
( branch snaps )

337
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,133
( gunshot )

338
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:46,571
( sighs )

339
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,574
You should go.

340
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,909
I just wanted to check on you.

341
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,833
Your eye.

342
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:00,585
He did it right when
it was happening.

343
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,378
It wasn't you.

344
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:08,926
People shouldn't see us
talking right now.

345
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,348
I'm not sorry I did it.

346
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:20,688
No matter what happens
or what I have to do.

347
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,484
Don't turn around, Rick.

348
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,865
You were right.

349
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:55,931
( chuckles )

350
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:59,393
What?

351
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,482
I came out here to...

352
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,777
not feel all closed up back there.

353
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:15,326
Even now,
this still feels more like me...

354
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:19,538
than back in them houses.

355
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,291
That's pretty messed up, huh?

356
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:26,545
You were trying.

357
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,174
I had to.

358
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,095
No, you didn't.

359
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:38,182
Listen, I saw you with your group
out there on the road.

360
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,185
Then you went off
on your own by the barn.

361
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:48,025
Storm hit and you led
your people to safety.

362
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,070
That was it.

363
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:54,865
I knew I had to bring
you people back.

364
00:33:57,911 --> 00:33:59,495
You were right.

365
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:02,540
We should have kept looking
for that guy in the poncho.

366
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,252
I shouldn't have given up.

367
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,713
You didn't.

368
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:17,346
I'll go.

369
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,726
I'll lead them out.
You make a break for the fence.

370
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:26,731
No, no, no.
This was my fault.

371
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,150
It wasn't a question.

372
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,068
And this ain't your decision.

373
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,280
It ain't nobody's fault.

374
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:37,658
Just let me finish
my smoke first.

375
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:44,957
No. You don't draw them away.

376
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,335
We fight.

377
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:51,046
We go for the fence.
We do it together.

378
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,507
All right,
whether we make it or not,

379
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:55,551
we do it together.

380
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:58,179
We have to.

381
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,190
All right.

382
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,778
- You ready?
- Yeah.

383
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:17,364
We'll go on three.

384
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,702
One, two--

385
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,183
Come on.
Come on, get in here.

386
00:35:58,198 --> 00:36:00,407
That was--

387
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,661
that was-- thank you.

388
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:08,582
I'm Aaron, this is Daryl.

389
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:14,296
Morgan.

390
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:17,550
Why?

391
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,427
Why?

392
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,098
Because all life
is precious, Daryl.

393
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,354
Whoever set that trap,
they're coming.

394
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:33,023
But I have good news.
We do.

395
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,151
We have a community
not too far from here.

396
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:39,113
Walls, electricity, it's safe.

397
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:40,698
If you'd like to come join us--

398
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:42,700
I thank you.

399
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:47,079
But I'm on my way
somewhere.

400
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:49,707
Fact is, I'm lost, so...

401
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:52,835
if you could tell me
where we are.

402
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,477
( whistling tune )

403
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,066
( munching )

404
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,699
( whistling louder )

405
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,088
I'm ready.

406
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,928
( snarling )

407
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,809
I'm ready.

408
00:38:12,374 --> 00:38:14,416
( gurgling )

409
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:20,130
( whimpers )

410
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,054
( splats )

411
00:38:32,394 --> 00:38:35,020
( gasping, gurgling )

412
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:51,161
( splats )

413
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,461
( sobbing )

414
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,440
Oh.
I'll come by later.

415
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,442
He's asleep.

416
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:25,487
He's asleep.
Sit.

417
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:52,014
( clatters )

418
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:53,974
Whoops.

419
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:04,651
Good afternoon.

420
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:16,580
Eugene:
She saved my life.

421
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:21,126
She also cracked
open my gourd

422
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:24,129
to considering
implications I hadn't.

423
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:26,632
I will remark about those
at this time.

424
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:31,220
You got us here.

425
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,892
All I did was craft
a top-shelf lie

426
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,853
to which a person with strength
and heroism could apply their talents.

427
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:42,147
My bet was you needed that.

428
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:47,361
I thank you.

429
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:52,074
I am sorry.

430
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:55,244
And I mean both emphatically
and in equal measure.

431
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:10,759
I'm...

432
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:14,721
sorry, too.

433
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,890
Utterly and completely
unnecessary.

434
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:19,143
I almost killed you.

435
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:23,772
Yes, there's that.

436
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,205
You're back.

437
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:42,666
Good, just wanted
to sneak off to the meeting.

438
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,757
You think we could find
some time to talk later?

439
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,843
About Aiden?

440
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,428
Just some things
I need to say

441
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:56,972
and I'm not sure
who I can say them to.

442
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,267
I don't really have
anyone here right now,

443
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,269
if you know what I mean.

444
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,104
I'll see.

445
00:42:05,315 --> 00:42:07,441
Cool.

446
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:09,484
Can you get that?

447
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,778
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

448
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:42,601
( snarling )

449
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:52,819
( gunshot )

450
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,155
( grunts )

451
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:00,702
( screams )

452
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:07,501
( groans )

453
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,754
( screams )

454
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:17,094
( screaming )

455
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:23,058
- ( snarling )
- ( Glenn screaming )

456
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:45,163
Rick.

457
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,834
You ready?

458
00:43:56,426 --> 00:43:59,052
Carol, Daryl,

459
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,054
and me...

460
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,725
we worked it out together.

461
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:11,356
Carol took three guns
from the armory.

462
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:14,151
I still have one,
she still has one.

463
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:21,783
We lied to you because I wasn't sure
how you'd take it,

464
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:23,744
what you'd do.

465
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:29,624
( jacket rustles )

466
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,877
You think I'd try to stop you?

467
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:38,383
Well, you did hit me
over the head.

468
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:42,304
That was for you, not them.

469
00:44:49,062 --> 00:44:51,897
I was afraid
you'd talk me out of it.

470
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:56,026
You could've.

471
00:44:57,904 --> 00:45:00,572
We don't need them here.

472
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,449
I don't need my sword.

473
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:07,162
I think you can find a way.

474
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:10,749
We can find a way.

475
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:14,628
And if we don't...

476
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:19,091
I'm still with you.

477
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:27,057
Something's gonna happen.

478
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:31,436
Just don't make
something happen.

479
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,285
Don't be too long.

480
00:46:02,135 --> 00:46:03,677
Bob's voice: You're gonna find
yourself in a place

481
00:46:03,845 --> 00:46:05,720
where it's like how it used to be.

482
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:08,348
And if you let too much go
along the way,

483
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:10,517
that's not gonna work.

484
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:14,896
'Cause you're gonna be back
in the real world.

485
00:46:15,064 --> 00:46:18,900
Rick's voice:
This is the real world, Bob.

486
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:21,778
Bob's voice:
Nah, this is a nightmare.

487
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:24,030
And nightmares end.

488
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,240
( door closes )

489
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:58,750
I came here...

490
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:06,466
because I don't--
I don't know what to do.

491
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:09,844
I'm losing my head.

492
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,519
Can you help me?

493
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:20,855
No.

494
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:25,569
( people chatting quietly )

495
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,080
We're going to start.

496
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:39,124
Can we wait?

497
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:40,750
There's still people coming.

498
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:43,211
Glenn, Rick.

499
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:45,463
We're going to start.

500
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,382
It's already dark.

501
00:48:48,718 --> 00:48:50,885
We're going to talk
about what happened.

502
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:54,514
Not the fight.
Not what precipitated it.

503
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:56,474
We're dealing with that.

504
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:59,394
We're going to talk about
one of our constables,

505
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:02,063
Rick Grimes.

506
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:06,443
We're going to talk about how he had
a pistol he stole from the armory,

507
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:08,528
about how he pointed it
at people.

508
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:11,239
And we're going to talk
about what he said.

509
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:13,408
I was hoping he'd be here.

510
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:15,619
She said he's coming.

511
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,621
I'm sure he'll be here.

512
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,332
And I'm sure we can
work this all out.

513
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:44,773
( distant dog barking )

514
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:00,121
I think I want to die.

515
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,419
Why wouldn't you want to die?

516
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:10,799
You don't deserve to be here.

517
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:15,345
What you did
can never be undone.

518
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:18,264
The dead don't choose,
but the choices you made,

519
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,725
how you sacrificed your own--

520
00:50:23,396 --> 00:50:25,730
I know what you're doing.

521
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,195
Bob was mutilated.

522
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:35,907
Consumed.

523
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:38,576
Destroyed because of your sins.

524
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:39,786
Stop it.

525
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:41,830
Your brother felt
he was apart from it.

526
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:43,665
He was a part of it.

527
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:45,083
He didn't deserve to be here.

528
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:46,918
- You don't!
- Stop it!

529
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:48,336
Stop it!

530
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:50,630
( barking continues )

531
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:56,010
( panting )

532
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:58,346
( snarling )

533
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:03,017
And after being out there

534
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:06,020
and then not being
how you were out there...

535
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,399
it can drive you crazy.

536
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:12,694
Rick just wants his family to live.

537
00:51:12,862 --> 00:51:16,030
He wants all of you to live.

538
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:22,370
Who he is
is who you're gonna be...

539
00:51:27,877 --> 00:51:29,419
if you're lucky.

540
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:33,673
( grunting )

541
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,346
( grunting )

542
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,223
( silenced gunshot )

543
00:51:53,903 --> 00:51:56,070
( grunts )

544
00:51:56,238 --> 00:52:00,658
Rick Grimes saved my life
over and over.

545
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:04,245
There's terrifying people
out there.

546
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:06,831
And he rescued me from them.

547
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:09,918
People like me,

548
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:13,087
people like us

549
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:16,549
need people like him.

550
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,388
I know what happened
last night was scary.

551
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:26,267
And I'm sure
he's sorry for that.

552
00:52:27,937 --> 00:52:30,647
But maybe we should listen
to what he was saying.

553
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:36,152
( snarling )

554
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,301
( crunching )

555
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:09,060
( groaning )

556
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:17,360
Simply put...

557
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,447
there is a vast ocean of shit

558
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:24,075
that you people
don't know shit about.

559
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:29,622
Rick knows every fine grain
of said shit...

560
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,252
and then some.

561
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:39,215
( snarling )

562
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:46,306
( gunshot )

563
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:52,520
- Please don't.
- Shh...

564
00:53:52,688 --> 00:53:55,440
- No.
- They'll hear you.

565
00:53:55,608 --> 00:53:57,775
It'll take longer to reset it.

566
00:53:59,028 --> 00:54:01,112
Just be still.

567
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,573
Just be still.

568
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,410
( gurgling )

569
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:09,537
Welcome home.

570
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,504
My father respected
Rick Grimes.

571
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:22,091
Rick is a father, too.

572
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,010
He's a man with a good heart

573
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:28,014
who feels the things he does,

574
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:29,724
the things he has to do.

575
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:35,396
And all of us who were together
before this place,

576
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:39,359
no matter when we found
each other, we're family now.

577
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,655
Rick started that.

578
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:45,573
And you won't stop it.

579
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:47,784
You can't.

580
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:50,078
And you don't want to.

581
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:53,790
This community,
you people...

582
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:58,086
that family...

583
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:02,298
you want to be a part of it, too.

584
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:09,973
Before we hear
from anyone else, I--

585
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:15,228
I would like to share something
in the spirit of transparency.

586
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:22,485
Father Gabriel came to see me
the day before yesterday

587
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:27,532
and he said our new arrivals
can't be trusted,

588
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,909
that they were dangerous,

589
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:33,788
that they would put themselves
before this community.

590
00:55:33,956 --> 00:55:37,375
And not one day later,

591
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:42,922
Rick seemed to demonstrate
all the things Father Gabriel said.

592
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:48,136
I had hoped Gabriel
would be here tonight.

593
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:50,638
I don't see him here,
Deanna.

594
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:52,974
So you're just saying
what someone said.

595
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:56,936
Did you tape him?

596
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:59,647
- He's not here.
- Neither is Rick.

597
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:06,654
Excuse me.

598
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:08,489
( grunts )

599
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:11,993
Noah died because of you.

600
00:56:12,161 --> 00:56:15,955
And I tried to tell you how it is,
how it has to be

601
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:17,874
and you try to kill me?

602
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:20,918
( sobbing )

603
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,962
( gun hammer clicks )

604
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:30,553
( breathing heavily )

605
00:56:32,765 --> 00:56:34,849
( snarling )

606
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:38,102
- ( beeps )
- ( loud music playing )

607
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:03,252
I just want to keep
my family safe, you know?

608
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,546
And I don't even know
what that means anymore,

609
00:57:05,714 --> 00:57:09,133
but if it means that
we've got to get rid of--

610
00:57:09,301 --> 00:57:10,760
( footsteps )

611
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,183
( women gasp )

612
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:25,441
( breathing heavily )

613
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,529
I was scared.
I was scared.

614
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,405
- I don't belong out here.
- Shut up.

615
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:33,825
( sobbing ) I was scared.
I was just scared.

616
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:36,744
- Shut up.
- I don't-- I don't belong--

617
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:39,622
- Shut up!
- ( sobbing )

618
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:42,917
I don't belong out here.

619
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:44,502
I don't.

620
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:48,840
Shut up.

621
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:52,927
( screams )

622
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:58,432
( Nicholas sobbing )

623
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:05,439
Gabriel:
Do it.

624
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:08,484
( breathing heavily )

625
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:10,361
( door opens )

626
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,990
Sasha.

627
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:18,369
( whimpering )

628
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:31,424
You should let her.

629
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:40,266
They died.

630
00:58:43,896 --> 00:58:46,230
They all died because of me.

631
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:00,995
They did.

632
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:18,095
There wasn't a guard
on the gate.

633
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:19,805
It was open.

634
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,682
I asked Gabriel to close it.

635
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:23,434
Go.

636
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,356
I didn't bring it in.

637
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:32,360
It got inside on its own.

638
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:37,865
They always will--
the dead and the living,

639
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:40,493
because we're in here.

640
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,205
And the ones out there...

641
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,252
...they'll hunt us.

642
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:55,216
They'll find us.

643
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,263
They'll try to use us.

644
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,978
They'll try to kill us.

645
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:35,089
But we'll kill them.

646
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:39,176
We'll survive.
I'll show you how.

647
01:00:42,264 --> 01:00:44,223
You know,
I was thinking--

648
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:51,230
I was thinking how many of you
do I have to kill

649
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:53,524
to save your lives?

650
01:00:59,948 --> 01:01:02,199
But I'm not gonna do that.

651
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:07,204
You're gonna change.

652
01:01:11,043 --> 01:01:13,544
I'm not sorry
for what I said last night.

653
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:18,591
I'm sorry for not
saying it sooner.

654
01:01:18,759 --> 01:01:20,968
You're not ready...

655
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:23,471
but you have to be.

656
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:26,515
Right now,
you have to be.

657
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:31,437
Luck runs out.

658
01:01:33,482 --> 01:01:35,316
( footsteps approaching )

659
01:01:35,484 --> 01:01:38,361
You're not one of us.
You're not one of us!

660
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:39,820
Pete, you don't want
to do this.

661
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:41,530
- Get the hell away from me, Reg.
- Pete, just stop.

662
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,741
- Get away from me.
- Deanna: Reg. Reg.

663
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:45,826
( whispers )
Not now.

664
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:47,828
- Get away. Get away!
- Pete, stop. Pete--

665
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:49,997
( Deanna screams )

666
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:56,170
- No, no! Oh, my God! No!
- ( gurgling )

667
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:58,297
Deanna: Oh, my love.
My love, my love.

668
01:01:58,465 --> 01:01:59,673
- This is him!
- Stop!

669
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:02,676
- This is him!
- ( Deanna sobbing ) Oh, God!

670
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:06,389
Oh! Oh, my love.
My love, my love.

671
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:09,058
( sobbing )
No, my love, no, no.

672
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:11,227
No, my love.

673
01:02:11,395 --> 01:02:13,270
No, my love, my love.

674
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:15,231
Pete:
It's him!

675
01:02:15,399 --> 01:02:17,608
This is him!

676
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:24,407
Rick...

677
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:30,371
do it.

678
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,916
- ( gunshot )
- ( women scream )

679
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:39,255
Morgan:
Rick?

680
01:02:54,062 --> 01:02:57,022
( theme music playing )

681
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:14,934
( snarling )

682
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:21,482
( cans rattling )
