1
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:35,868
( footsteps )

2
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,330
( walker snarling )

3
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,582
( sniffles )

4
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:24,292
( crying )

5
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,085
Maggie:
Oh, shit.

6
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,255
It's been a day and a half.

7
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,676
They didn't find any either.

8
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,805
- Sasha: How do you know?
- I know.

9
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,564
How much longer we got?

10
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,901
60 miles.

11
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,030
I wasn't talking about that.

12
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,665
( theme music playing )

13
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,703
( engine sputtering )

14
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,916
Abraham: We're out,
just like the other one.

15
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:53,960
Rick:
So we walk.

16
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:23,155
We're not at our strongest.

17
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,076
We'll get 'em when it's best.

18
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,620
High ground,
something like that.

19
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,790
They're not going anywhere.

20
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,630
It's been three weeks
since Atlanta.

21
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,968
I know you lost
something back there.

22
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:47,138
( Judith fussing )

23
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,725
She's hungry.

24
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,645
She's okay.

25
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,815
She's going to be okay.

26
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:02,945
We need to find water, food.

27
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,449
We'll hit something in the road.

28
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,203
It's gonna rain sooner or later.

29
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,999
I'm gonna head out.

30
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,834
See what I can find.

31
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:20,087
Hey, don't be too long.

32
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,338
I'll go with you.

33
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,674
I got it.

34
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,551
You gonna stop me?

35
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,768
Found this when we were
looking for water.

36
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,811
What is it?

37
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,105
I think it used to play music.

38
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,484
It's broken.

39
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,446
Thanks, Carl.

40
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,198
I thought you might like it.

41
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,044
I used to joke these things
were leftovers

42
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:02,296
from the days of hair shirts.

43
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,549
The church actually made...

44
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,846
shirts out of hair.

45
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,557
So if you wore it,
you could atone

46
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,060
just a little for your sins.

47
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:18,646
I know what a hair shirt is.

48
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:21,232
My daddy was religious.

49
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:24,568
I used to be.

50
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,199
If you ever want to talk

51
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:34,036
about your father
or about Beth--

52
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,955
Please, stop.

53
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,627
Whenever you're ready,
I'm here.

54
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,338
You never even met them.

55
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,009
- I know you're in pain.
- You don't know shit.

56
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:52,012
You had a job.

57
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,473
You were there
to save your flock, right?

58
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,142
But you didn't.

59
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,562
You hid.

60
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:04,191
Don't act like
that didn't happen.

61
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,953
( walkers snarling )

62
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,390
We can take 'em.

63
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,978
Rick's right.

64
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,314
We barely have anything left.

65
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,900
No use in spending it all now.

66
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,987
I can take 'em.

67
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,075
Your brother was pissed, too,

68
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,994
after what he lost.

69
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:02,374
- It made him stupid.
- We are not the same.

70
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,212
We never were.

71
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,380
But it's still the same.

72
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:12,843
It just is.

73
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:35,282
Carol:
Anything?

74
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,534
No, it's too dry.

75
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:38,869
There ain't nothing here.

76
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,871
Maybe we should start back.

77
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,706
You go.

78
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,377
I think she saved my life.

79
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,758
She saved your life,
too, right?

80
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,064
It was hers.

81
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,701
We're not dead.

82
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,372
That's what you said.

83
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:29,003
You're not dead.

84
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,466
I know you.

85
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,970
We're different.
I can't let myself...

86
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,181
But you...

87
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,643
I know you.

88
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:50,024
You have to let yourself feel it.

89
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,291
You will.

90
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:17,468
( walkers snarling )

91
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,682
( snarling continues )

92
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,197
( snarling continues )

93
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,205
( grunting )

94
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,706
Sasha.

95
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:35,712
Stay in line.
Flank her.

96
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,881
Keep it controlled.

97
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,967
Plan just got dicked.

98
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,974
Stop.
Just get out of here.

99
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,082
I told you to stop.

100
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,751
( panting )

101
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:51,330
Carl:
Dad, look.

102
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,633
I'm gonna head into the woods,

103
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,884
circle back.

104
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,969
- May I come with?
- No.

105
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,971
No, just me.

106
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,399
( snarling )

107
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:27,050
( thumping )

108
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,145
( thumping continues )

109
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,217
Maggie.

110
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,222
There's one--

111
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,933
there's one in there.

112
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,603
And I shut it
and it's still in there.

113
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,357
Okay.

114
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,448
( grunts )

115
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,495
( lock clicks )

116
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,667
( snarling )

117
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,761
- ( flesh squelches )
- ( snarling stops )

118
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,817
Let's go.

119
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,911
( thunder rumbling )

120
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,955
( branch snaps )

121
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,895
Tara: So all we found
was booze?

122
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,563
Rosita:
Yeah.

123
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:29,941
It's not gonna help.

124
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,818
He knows that.

125
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:35,071
- It's gonna make it worse.
- Yes, it is.

126
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,324
Eugene:
He's a grown man.

127
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:40,494
And I truly do not know
if things can get worse.

128
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,332
They can.

129
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,880
- ( rustling )
- ( growling )

130
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,636
( barking, growling )

131
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,770
- ( silenced gunshots )
- ( dogs whine )

132
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,498
Your brother...

133
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,043
he tried to help me.

134
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,465
I don't know
if I'm gonna make it.

135
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,677
Then you won't.

136
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:31,313
Don't think.

137
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,273
Just eat.

138
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,543
- Maggie, take a drink.
- No.

139
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:41,508
Okay.

140
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,844
How about you just talk to me?

141
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,809
I never thought she was alive.

142
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:53,603
I just didn't.

143
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:58,942
After Daddy, I don't know
if I couldn't.

144
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,277
And after what Daryl said,

145
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,905
I hoped she was
out there, alive.

146
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,866
And then finding out
that she was

147
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,494
and then she wasn't
in the same day...

148
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,458
Seeing her like that, it--

149
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:21,339
made it feel like none of it
was ever really there.

150
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,429
Before...

151
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,140
this was just
the dark part and...

152
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:36,479
I don't know if I want
to fight it anymore.

153
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,982
You do.

154
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,484
You do.

155
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,486
That's who you are.

156
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:48,158
And maybe
it's a curse nowadays,

157
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,785
but I don't think so.

158
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:53,830
We fought to be here.

159
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,166
And we have to keep fighting.

160
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,879
Drink.

161
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,269
You know it'll just make
things worse.

162
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,357
The way you're going,

163
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,818
you're what's gonna
make things worse.

164
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:31,117
Hey, you're with friends.

165
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,038
We're not friends.

166
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,725
Daryl.

167
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,061
No, I'm all right.

168
00:23:58,229 --> 00:23:59,979
Daryl.

169
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:03,024
Don't.

170
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:07,237
Hey, we can make it together.

171
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,740
But we can only make it together.

172
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:21,084
Tell them I went looking for water.

173
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:37,493
( sizzling )

174
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,113
( crying )

175
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:49,857
What else are we gonna do?

176
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,276
Not this.

177
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:53,736
We don't know who left it.

178
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:56,239
If that's a trap,
we already happen to be in it.

179
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:59,325
But I, for one, would like to think
it is indeed from a friend.

180
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:03,538
What if it isn't?
They put something in it?

181
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,667
- Rosita: Eugene.
- Tara: What are you doing, dude?

182
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:09,127
Quality assurance.

183
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,431
We can't.

184
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:27,770
( thunder rumbling )

185
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,156
( thunderclap )

186
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,792
( laughing )

187
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,630
( laughing )

188
00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:00,845
Oh, God.

189
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:17,653
I'm sorry, my Lord.

190
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:21,491
Rick: Everybody get the bags.
Anything you can find.

191
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,950
I'm sorry.

192
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,494
Come on.

193
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:28,039
( thunderclap )

194
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:33,252
- ( Judith crying )
- ( thunder booming )

195
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:47,850
Let's keep moving.

196
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,649
- There's a barn.
- Where?

197
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:56,984
( thunder booming )

198
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,186
( snarling )

199
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,432
She had a gun.

200
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,601
She could have shot herself.

201
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,563
Some people can't give up.

202
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,942
Like us.

203
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,492
( thunder crashing )

204
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,809
- I'll try.
- No, too wet.

205
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,151
Carol:
He's gonna be okay.

206
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,530
He bounces back

207
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,157
more than any of us do.

208
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:11,577
I used to feel sorry for kids
that have to grow up now.

209
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:13,454
In this.

210
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,292
But I think I got it wrong.

211
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,548
Growing up
is getting used to the world.

212
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:28,678
This is easier for them.

213
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,680
This isn't the world.

214
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:34,392
This isn't it.

215
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,235
It might be.

216
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:47,697
It might.

217
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,116
- That's giving up.
- It's reality.

218
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:54,870
Until we see otherwise,
this is what we have to live with.

219
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:10,595
When I was a kid...

220
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:16,767
I asked my grandpa once if he ever
killed any Germans in the war.

221
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:21,397
He wouldn't answer.

222
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:26,193
He said that was
grown-up stuff, so...

223
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:32,241
so I asked if the Germans
ever tried to kill him.

224
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,747
But he got real quiet.

225
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:48,966
He said he was dead the minute
he stepped into enemy territory.

226
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:55,473
Every day he woke up

227
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:57,475
and told himself,
"Rest in peace.

228
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:59,977
Now get up and go to war."

229
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:06,901
And then after a few years
of pretending he was dead...

230
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:12,531
he made it out alive.

231
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:16,786
That's the trick of it, I think.

232
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:21,123
We do what we need to do

233
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:24,293
and then we get to live.

234
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:30,841
But no matter what we find in DC,
I know we'll be okay.

235
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:35,763
Because this is how we survive.

236
00:33:38,392 --> 00:33:40,351
We tell ourselves...

237
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:45,690
that we are the walking dead.

238
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,206
We ain't them.

239
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:12,341
( branch snaps )

240
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:16,762
We're not them.

241
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,180
Hey.

242
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,851
We're not.

243
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:30,609
- We ain't them.
- ( thunder booms )

244
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:49,962
( thunder crashing )

245
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:54,300
( doors rattling )

246
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:10,316
( snarling )

247
00:35:10,484 --> 00:35:12,151
( gasps )

248
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,245
( thudding )

249
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:26,081
( walkers snarling )

250
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,797
( crying )

251
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:18,300
( wind howling )

252
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,335
You should get some sleep.

253
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:37,421
Yeah.

254
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,717
It's okay to rest now.

255
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:49,516
He was tough.

256
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,269
He was.

257
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,359
So was she.

258
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:03,739
She didn't know it,

259
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:05,866
but she was.

260
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:25,094
The gearbox had some grit in it.

261
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,096
Thank you.

262
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:56,625
Come on.

263
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:02,589
- ( door opens )
- ( walkers snarling )

264
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,367
Look at this.

265
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,828
( snarling )

266
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,416
Sasha:
Should have torn us apart.

267
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,296
It didn't.

268
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:06,904
Sasha:
Why are we here?

269
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:10,532
Maggie:
For this.

270
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,707
I see it.

271
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:26,048
Noah, that kid...

272
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,555
he said he didn't know
if he can make it.

273
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,564
That's how I feel.

274
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:47,903
You're gonna make it.

275
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,618
Both of us, we will.

276
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:59,081
That's the hard part.

277
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,262
Daryl fixed it.

278
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:19,309
( winding up )

279
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,693
( clicks )

280
00:41:27,861 --> 00:41:30,487
( sighs )
You gotta be kidding me.

281
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:33,740
( both laugh )

282
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:36,451
Hey. Hi.

283
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:40,038
I didn't mean to interrupt.

284
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,999
Good morning.

285
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,877
My name is Aaron.

286
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:49,798
I know, stranger danger.

287
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:54,052
But I'm a friend.

288
00:41:57,265 --> 00:42:00,851
I'd like to talk
to the person in charge.

289
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,811
Rick, right?

290
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:05,689
- How do you know--
- Why?

291
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,816
I have good news.

292
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:11,153
( music box playing )

293
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:23,123
( theme music playing )
