There's more of them around here
than there used to be.

26
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,492
- Don't know if any people are--
- Shh.

27
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,661
Someone is.

28
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:03,052
( theme music playing )

29
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:40,214
( audio rewinding )

30
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:50,391
Aiden was trying to save us

31
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,977
from a roamer,

32
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:55,229
shooting at it.

33
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,485
Then Glenn distracted him.

34
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,946
I saw the grenades.

35
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,828
I tried to stop him.

36
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:13,748
They wanted to just go,
I didn't.

37
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,458
He was gonna run.

38
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,918
Nicholas:
I wasn't gonna leave him.

39
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,420
Deanna:
What about Tara?

40
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,172
I wasn't gonna leave her.

41
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,799
But we made him stay.

42
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,597
Couldn't get Aiden
out of there without help.

43
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:32,433
Then when we got
into the lobby...

44
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,351
All he had to do
was hold the door.

45
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,853
Nicholas:
...he was hitting on the glass,

46
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,147
pushing my door open.

47
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,857
They were gonna kill me.

48
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,942
But he panicked.

49
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,570
Or they were trying to.
Or they just didn't care.

50
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,031
Noah-- I had him.

51
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,950
I had his hand.

52
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:55,498
And if I didn't push back,
I'd be dead, too.

53
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,002
I tried.

54
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,635
I watched him die.

55
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,309
Nicholas:
They did this.

56
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,436
It was them.

57
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,647
Deanna: But you all
came back together.

58
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:21,398
How did that happen?

59
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,944
Spencer:
Mom, what are you doing?

60
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:28,322
Deanna: I need it for later.
We have to do this now.

61
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,123
No guns.
No going outside the walls.

62
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,000
Same goes for Glenn
until I finish looking into this.

63
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,377
Nicholas: What do you need
to look into?

64
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,796
I-- I'm telling you
how it went down.

65
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,589
These people have to go.

66
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,134
They are not like us.

67
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,177
I know you see it, too.

68
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:53,514
Deanna: You don't know
what I see, Nicholas.

69
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,975
And I see a great deal.

70
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,820
I almost left him out there.

71
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,530
Could have told a story.

72
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:16,203
What, you think I should have?

73
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,205
They don't know
what they're doing.

74
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,207
- Any of them.
- We'll show them.

75
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,377
I don't know
if they can see it.

76
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,921
How things really are.
I don't know if they can yet.

77
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:29,466
- They haven't caught up.
- We have to be here.

78
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,511
- We have to.
- Yeah, we do.

79
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,056
But their rules,
we don't answer to them.

80
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,476
We are them, Rick.

81
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,520
We are now.

82
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:47,234
Noah, he believed
in this place.

83
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,198
I'm telling you,
we gotta make this work.

84
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:32,112
I sent a casserole
to Deanna's family.

85
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,281
We want her to see that.

86
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,328
Thought about Pete?

87
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,121
About what I said?

88
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:43,999
Yeah.

89
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,045
Talked to Sam some more.

90
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:54,301
He said his mom put a bolt
on the inside of his closet.

91
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,637
Tells him to lock
himself in sometimes

92
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,806
and not come out
till morning.

93
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,102
He said he can hear
his dad yelling,

94
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,604
things breaking,
his mom crying.

95
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,149
Last month it got quiet
right in the middle of it

96
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,652
and he went out
and found her on the floor...

97
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,323
unconscious, bleeding.

98
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,786
Pete was just sitting
on the porch.

99
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,834
Why do you care
what happens to Jessie?

100
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,670
You know why.

101
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,674
And I know why you do.

102
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,554
Why?

103
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:43,392
I've seen you talk to her.

104
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,526
Carol:
If walkers hadn't gotten Ed,

105
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:56,238
I wouldn't be standing here
right now.

106
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:01,785
Yeah, you would.

107
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,661
Hey, Rick.

108
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,334
Rick.

109
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,970
You okay, man?

110
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,566
Keep walking.

111
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,946
What?
What are you--

112
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,648
( sighs )

113
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,983
( sighs )

114
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,612
( knocks )

115
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,405
Come in.

116
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,074
Hey.

117
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,702
- How is she?
- Stable.

118
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,622
Hanging on.
I'm gonna go back there later.

119
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,502
I think Sasha might have spent
the night in the tower.

120
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,045
Is she still up there?

121
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,297
Abraham's on watch now,
but she hasn't been back

122
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,216
and nobody's seen her.

123
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,561
Rosita:
It's up ahead.

124
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,063
Michonne:
She told you about it?

125
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:18,357
Rosita: I saw her going out
one day with her rifle.

126
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:19,900
I knew somebody
was already in the tower.

127
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,527
I asked.

128
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,445
( running footsteps )

129
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,425
It's the first time I've been out
since we've been here.

130
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,427
Me, too.

131
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,347
It already feels different.

132
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,307
That's good.

133
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,476
I don't know.

134
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:01,108
After Eugene,

135
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:03,610
after finding out he lied,

136
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:08,323
I was screwed up
because I lost something.

137
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:13,078
You seem screwed up
because we found something.

138
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,667
Noah's dead.

139
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,711
And I think--

140
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,467
I just feel like
I was asleep in there.

141
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,637
You were trying to forget
so you could try.

142
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:33,181
- I don't want to forget.
- So don't.

143
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,435
But that doesn't mean
you have to give up.

144
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,687
You didn't bring
your sword with you.

145
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,898
That's not nothing.

146
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:03,170
I'm sorry for what happened.

147
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,632
How are you holding up?

148
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,218
I'm not.

149
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,683
We have a problem with Pete.

150
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:23,398
I hoped it'd get better.

151
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,693
You knew?

152
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,615
It hasn't gotten better.
It won't.

153
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,575
Pete's a surgeon.

154
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,704
He's saved lives.

155
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,247
He might be saving Tara's life.

156
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,708
He's beating his wife.

157
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,711
- We have to stop it.
- How?

158
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,171
We separate them.

159
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,881
We tell him that's how it'll be
from now on.

160
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,342
What happens when he doesn't
want to do that?

161
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:58,016
It's not his choice.

162
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,979
So what happens?

163
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,567
I kill him.

164
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,611
We kill him.

165
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,988
We don't kill people.

166
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,450
This is civilization, Rick.

167
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:19,413
Warning someone to stop or die,
that is civilized nowadays.

168
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,831
- Oh.
- So what?

169
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,874
So we just let him hit her?

170
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,376
We let him kill her?

171
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,421
No, we exile him
if it comes to that.

172
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,965
We do that, we don't know
when he comes back

173
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,717
and what he does to them.

174
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,928
Letting him go
makes this place vulnerable.

175
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:38,098
You really want to wait till someone
in that tower has to take care of it?

176
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:44,104
- And that's if we're lucky.
- We are not... executing anyone.

177
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:47,149
Don't ever suggest it again.

178
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,278
That sort of thinking
doesn't belong in here.

179
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:54,865
People die now, Deanna.
They do.

180
00:17:56,576 --> 00:18:00,620
There's times like this
you can decide who and when.

181
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,956
Or it can be decided for you.

182
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,334
It already was.

183
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,964
I wouldn't kill you.

184
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,760
I'd just send you away.

185
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,480
Michonne:
Got it in the back of the head.

186
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,191
Had to be her.

187
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,496
Back of the head.

188
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:52,255
She's hunting them.

189
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:13,485
( twigs snap )

190
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,029
Enid:
Carl.

191
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,865
I know you're following me.

192
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,867
Again.

193
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,495
And you're going
the wrong way.

194
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,705
You knew?

195
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,542
- Enid: You're very loud.
- ( twigs snap )

196
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,171
Can you go back?

197
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,257
To be honest,
you scare me.

198
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,260
You shouldn't sneak out
by yourself.

199
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,137
Two people just died.

200
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,764
Oh, come on.

201
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,477
People always die.
You know that.

202
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,063
We should go back.

203
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:51,898
Why?

204
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:56,236
What do you do
out here anyways?

205
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,240
Same thing as you.

206
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:27,684
( snarling )

207
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,279
( clicking, ticking )

208
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:49,623
( alarm ringing )

209
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:17,025
Nicholas, don't talk,
just listen.

210
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:20,320
Those four people
you lost on that run,

211
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:21,988
that's on you.

212
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:25,700
And Noah,
that's on you, too.

213
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:30,830
Those five lives,
you have to carry that.

214
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,794
People like you
are supposed to be dead,

215
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:40,215
but these walls went up
just in time, so you're not.

216
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,637
You don't go outside
those walls anymore.

217
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:49,349
Not by yourself,
not with anyone else.

218
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,018
And that's how
you're gonna survive.

219
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:54,604
Who the hell
do you think you are?

220
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:58,191
I'm someone who knows
who you are.

221
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,695
I know what you did.

222
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,614
And it's not gonna
happen again.

223
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:07,784
I've been protecting this place,
helping provide for it.

224
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,703
You just got here.

225
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:13,540
Don't forget what I said.

226
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:16,042
Are you threatening me?

227
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:19,504
( chuckles )
No.

228
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,506
I'm saving you.

229
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,607
( panting )

230
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:46,072
We're supposed
to be out here.

231
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,784
We're supposed
to feel like this.

232
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,581
I don't want to forget.

233
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:02,172
And running
makes me feel better.

234
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,384
I can't forget.

235
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,762
I dream about it.

236
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:12,432
Being in the forest with them.

237
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,146
I do, too.

238
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:24,486
Ron's a good guy.

239
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,614
He is.

240
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:31,201
Does he know
you come out here?

241
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:34,954
No, I--
he wouldn't understand.

242
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:41,836
Why do I scare you?

243
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,006
I don't know.
You just do.

244
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,637
Cool knife.

245
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,307
It was my mom's.

246
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:01,981
What happened to you
before you got there?

247
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,860
Does it matter?

248
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:08,988
It does.
I know.

249
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,574
Something bad
has happened to me, too.

250
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,289
( walkers snarling )

251
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,876
We need to go.
Sounds like a lot.

252
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,561
It's their world.

253
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,980
We're just living in it.

254
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:09,007
Cool.

255
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:11,217
You're afraid of me, too.

256
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:58,932
( silenced gunshots )

257
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:18,284
( snarling )

258
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,254
( silenced gunshot )

259
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,673
- Michonne: Sasha.
- ( sighs )

260
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,509
- ( walkers snarling )
- Go back.

261
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:36,302
What are you doing?

262
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,846
I'm sick of playing defense.

263
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,224
So you're just gonna
take on all of them?

264
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:42,976
Yeah.

265
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:58,908
Rosita:
We've got to get out of here.

266
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:01,494
Oh, you do, I don't.

267
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,184
- I don't need your help.
- This isn't for you.

268
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,750
( gun clicks )

269
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:11,981
( panting )
I had it.

270
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:13,566
Don't need your help.

271
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,952
I told you to go.

272
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,587
You...

273
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:36,589
you can't do anything.

274
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:39,884
It worked out for you.

275
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,844
Don't you see that?

276
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,474
You can't help me.

277
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:48,935
Nobody--

278
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,907
Noah.

279
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,161
I told him
he wouldn't make it.

280
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,524
Whoever did this
took what was left with them.

281
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,572
This just happened.

282
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:12,411
( flies buzzing )

283
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:16,916
She's tied up.

284
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,919
And they fed on her.

285
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:24,215
Tore her apart.

286
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,719
This just happened?

287
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,431
Yeah.

288
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:37,186
How the hell did this happen?

289
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:48,447
( snarling )

290
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,629
Jessie.

291
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:05,590
Hey.

292
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:10,094
I don't want Ron and Sam
to know about those.

293
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:13,180
Well, your secret's safe.

294
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,813
Noah was a sweet kid.

295
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:22,481
( sighs )

296
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:28,904
But Tara, she's--
she's in good hands with Pete.

297
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,032
He's hitting you.

298
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,120
He's hurting you.

299
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:39,999
It has to stop.

300
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,674
- It will.
- How?

301
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:52,094
There are things
in his life that happened.

302
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:54,221
I don't care.

303
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:00,186
Look, it was like this before
and he got help.

304
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:04,106
I helped him
and things were good.

305
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,194
I can fix it.

306
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:11,447
No, you can't.
But I can.

307
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,867
No, what--
what can you do?

308
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:17,078
What are you gonna do?
You gonna put him in jail?

309
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:21,415
You're only gonna
make things worse.

310
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:26,045
If it's gotten worse,
it means he's killed you.

311
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:27,546
That's what's next.

312
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,549
And I'm not gonna
let that happen.

313
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,390
Why do you care?

314
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:47,066
Why is this
so important to you?

315
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,237
Now?
You've made it.

316
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:53,989
You have a home
for your kids.

317
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:57,576
Rick, what are you doing?

318
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:58,994
I'm trying to help.

319
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,996
I don't know that.

320
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,585
I'm married.

321
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:13,426
Okay?
I can take care of myself.

322
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:16,262
We have to take care
of ourselves.

323
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,408
What are you doing?

324
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,871
You know Sam asked for a gun?

325
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,748
To protect you.

326
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,462
You shouldn't be here.

327
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:35,549
Jessie, in here, you can't see it,
but it's the same.

328
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:37,510
It's the same as out there.

329
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,762
We have food
and roofs over our heads,

330
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,515
but you don't get to just live.

331
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:46,268
You don't get to put it off
or wish it away, Jessie.

332
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:50,064
If you don't fight,
you die.

333
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:55,778
And...

334
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,782
and I don't want you to die.

335
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,371
I can-- I can help you.

336
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:09,291
I can keep you
and your boys safe.

337
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,547
I can.

338
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,219
All you have to do is say yes.

339
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:31,647
Would you do this
for someone else?

340
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:38,112
Would you do this
for anyone?

341
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,499
No. No.

342
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,257
Yes.

343
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:03,596
Rick.

344
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,349
What are you doing here?

345
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:11,562
Pete.

346
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,648
What are you doing here?

347
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:18,360
Listen to me.

348
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:21,155
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave, Rick.

349
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:25,951
No.

350
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,499
Excuse me?

351
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,339
You need to leave.

352
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,551
What are you talking about?

353
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,471
Just go, Pete.

354
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:50,142
What have you been
saying to each other?

355
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,061
Huh?

356
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:54,813
What have you been doing?!

357
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,232
Pete, you and me
are gonna leave now.

358
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,026
You come into my house...

359
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:01,153
Pete, you and me
are leaving.

360
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:03,155
Pete:
You're leaving right now.

361
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:05,491
You think you're the law?

362
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:08,494
You actually think you have a say
in anything here?

363
00:38:08,662 --> 00:38:10,829
- Step back.
- Who the hell do you think you are?

364
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,831
Someone who's trying
not to kill you.

365
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,208
No!

366
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,419
- You wanna stop now!
- ( shouts )

367
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,173
Come into my house?!

368
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:23,258
- Pete, stop it!
- It's my house!

369
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,885
Pete, stop it!

370
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:27,054
( shouts )

371
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,555
( glass breaks )

372
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,766
- ( fight continues )
- Jessie: No! Stop it!

373
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:32,810
( shouting )

374
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:38,816
( snarling )

375
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,320
( distant glass breaks )

376
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:54,873
( screams )

377
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,210
( grunting )

378
00:38:58,378 --> 00:38:59,878
Deanna!

379
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:26,905
Ah!

380
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,500
Dad, get off!

381
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:58,228
Deanna:
Stop it!

382
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,522
Stop it right now.

383
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,943
You touch them again
and I'll kill you.

384
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,529
Damn it, Rick!
I said stop.

385
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,116
Or what?

386
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:15,120
You gonna kick me out?

387
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,123
Put that gun down, Rick.

388
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:20,501
( panting )

389
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,966
You still don't get it.

390
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,637
None of you do!

391
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:34,807
( snarling )

392
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:40,020
Rick: We know what needs
to be done and we do it.

393
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,731
( silenced gunshot )

394
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:44,817
Rick:
We're the ones who live.

395
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:55,077
You, you just sit
and plan and hesitate.

396
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:59,164
You pretend like you know
when you don't.

397
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,919
- ( walkers snarling )
- ( silenced gunshots )

398
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:07,381
Rick: You wish things
weren't what they are.

399
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:09,341
Well, you want to live?

400
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:13,178
You want this place
to stay standing?

401
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:15,013
( silenced gunshot )

402
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,224
Your way of doing things is done.

403
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,604
Things don't get better
because you-- you want them to.

404
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:29,069
Starting right now,
we have to live in the real world.

405
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:33,907
We have to control
who lives here.

406
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:38,704
That's never been more clear to me
than it is right now.

407
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:41,039
Me? Me? You--

408
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,709
( laughs )
You mean-- you mean me?

409
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:50,007
Your way is gonna
destroy this place.

410
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:51,383
It's gonna get people killed.

411
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:54,303
It's already gotten
people killed.

412
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:58,223
And I'm not gonna stand by
and just let it happen.

413
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:01,226
If you don't fight, you die.

414
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:03,103
I'm not gonna stand by and--

415
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:05,314
( grunts )

416
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:09,943
( panting )

417
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:24,917
( theme music playing )
