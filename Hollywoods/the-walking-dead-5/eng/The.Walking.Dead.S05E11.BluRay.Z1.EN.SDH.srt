1
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,318
Maggie:
Hey.

2
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,279
Everyone...

3
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,575
this is Aaron.

4
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,709
We met him outside.
He's by himself.

5
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,128
We took his weapons
and we took his gear.

6
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,468
( chains rattling )

7
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,265
Hi.

8
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:00,268
( crying )

9
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:03,354
Shh.

10
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,984
It's nice to meet you.

11
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:11,904
You said he had a weapon?

12
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,630
There something you need?

13
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:32,759
He has a camp nearby.

14
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,764
He wants us to audition
for membership.

15
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:41,058
I wish there was another word.

16
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:44,812
Audition makes it sound like
we're some kind of a dance troupe.

17
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,939
That's only on Friday nights.

18
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,489
Um, and it's not a camp.

19
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,532
It's a community.

20
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,536
I think you all would make
valuable additions.

21
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,997
But it's not my call.

22
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,794
My job is to convince you all
to follow me back home.

23
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,255
I know.

24
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,758
If I were you,
I wouldn't go either.

25
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:16,552
Not until I knew exactly
what I was getting into.

26
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,389
Sasha, can you
hand Rick my pack?

27
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,568
Front pocket,
there's an envelope.

28
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,784
There's no way I could
convince you to come with me

29
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:42,245
just by talking
about our community.

30
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,830
That's why I brought those.

31
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,416
I apologize in advance
for the picture quality.

32
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,210
We just found
an old camera store last--

33
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:50,920
Nobody gives a shit.

34
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,591
You're absolutely 100% right.

35
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,763
That's the first picture
I wanted to show you

36
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,808
because nothing I say about
our community will matter

37
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:06,310
unless you know you'll be safe.

38
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:09,188
If you join us, you will be.

39
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:12,400
Each panel in that wall

40
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:18,114
is a 15-foot-high,
12-foot-wide slab of solid steel

41
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:22,660
framed by cold-rolled steel beams
and square tubing.

42
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:27,498
Nothing alive or dead
gets through that without our say-so.

43
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,837
Like I said, security
is obviously important.

44
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,631
In fact, there's only
one resource

45
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,593
more critical
to our community's survival--

46
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,511
the people.

47
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,974
Together we're strong.

48
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:48,144
You can make us
even stronger.

49
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:55,484
The next picture,
you'll see inside the gates.

50
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,820
Our community
was first construc--

51
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,831
( theme music playing )

52
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:47,870
So we're clear,

53
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,164
that look wasn't
a "let's attack that man" look.

54
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,333
It was a "he seems like
an okay guy to me" look.

55
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,210
We got to secure him.
Dump his pack.

56
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,212
- Let's see what this guy really is.
- Rick.

57
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,090
Everybody else,
we need eyes in every direction.

58
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,925
They're coming for us.

59
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:03,427
We might not know
how or when, but they are.

60
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,307
Me and Sasha,
we didn't see him.

61
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,892
If he had wanted
to hurt us, he could've.

62
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,937
- Anybody see anything?
- Just a lot of places to hide.

63
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:15,314
Rick:
All right, keep looking.

64
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,191
What did you find?

65
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,529
Never seen a gun like that before.

66
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:36,085
( groaning )

67
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,590
That's a hell
of a right cross there, Rick.

68
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,260
Sit him up.

69
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:47,096
- I think it's better if--
- It's okay.

70
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,597
( groans )

71
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,100
He's fine.
Sit him up.

72
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,269
( groans )

73
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,815
You're being cautious.

74
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,025
I completely understand.

75
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,194
How many of your people
are out there?

76
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,032
You have a flare gun.
You have it to signal your people.

77
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,117
How many of them are there?

78
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,661
( sighs )

79
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,831
- Does it matter?
- Yes.

80
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,459
Yes, it does.

81
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,461
I mean, of course,

82
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:22,089
it matters how many people
are actually out there,

83
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,425
but does it matter
how many people

84
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,844
I tell you are out there?

85
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:31,599
Because I'm pretty sure
no matter what number I say--

86
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,976
eight,

87
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,811
32,

88
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,105
444,

89
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:41,067
zero--

90
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,611
no matter what I say,
you're not going to trust me.

91
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,446
Well, it's hard to trust anyone
who smiles

92
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,031
after getting
punched in the face.

93
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,534
How about a guy who leaves
bottles of water for you in the road?

94
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,792
How long you people
been following us?

95
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,628
Long enough to see that
you practically ignore

96
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,756
a pack of roamers
on your trail.

97
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:07,593
Long enough to see
that despite a lack of food and water,

98
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,512
you never turned on each other.

99
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,764
You're survivors

100
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,433
and you're people.

101
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,685
Like I said, and I hope

102
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,563
you won't punch me
for saying it again,

103
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:23,192
that is the most important
resource in the world.

104
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,337
How many others are out there?

105
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,214
One.

106
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,054
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

107
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:56,559
If it's not words,
if it's not pictures,

108
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,060
what would it take
to convince you

109
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,229
that this is for real?

110
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,945
What if I drove you
to the community?

111
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:09,947
All of you?

112
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,533
We leave now,
we'll get there by lunch.

113
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,493
I'm not sure
how the 15 of us are gonna fit

114
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,121
in the car you and your one friend
drove down here in.

115
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,290
We drove separately.
If we found a group,

116
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,000
we wanted to be able
to bring them all home.

117
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,585
There's enough room
for all of us.

118
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,629
And you're parked
just a couple miles away, right?

119
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,299
East on Ridge Road,
just after you hit Route 16.

120
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,177
We wanted to get them closer,
but then the storm came,

121
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,262
blocked the road.
We couldn't clear it.

122
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,098
Yeah, you've really
thought this through.

123
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,767
Rick, if I wanted
to ambush you,

124
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,603
I'd do it here.

125
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,897
You know, light the barn on fire
while you slept,

126
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,608
pick you off as you ran out
the only exit.

127
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,569
You can trust me.

128
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,164
I'll check out the cars.

129
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:03,167
There aren't any cars.

130
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:04,460
There's only one way
to find out.

131
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:07,338
- We don't need to find out.
- We do.

132
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,927
You know what you know
and you're sure of it,

133
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,762
but I'm not.

134
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,474
Maggie:
Me neither.

135
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,692
Your way is dangerous,
mine isn't.

136
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,362
Passing up someplace
where we can live?

137
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,822
Where Judith can live?

138
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,908
That's pretty dangerous.

139
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:41,038
We need to find out what this is.

140
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,167
We can handle ourselves.

141
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,046
So that's what we're gonna do.

142
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,969
Then I will, too.

143
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,054
I'll go.

144
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,687
Abraham.

145
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,398
Yeah.

146
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,026
I'll walk with them.

147
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,489
Rosita?

148
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,742
Okay.

149
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,578
If there's trouble,
you got enough firepower?

150
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,747
We got what we got.

151
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,378
The walkies are out of juice.

152
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:32,715
If you're not back
in 60 minutes, we'll come.

153
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,259
Which might be
just what they want.

154
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:41,223
If we're all in here,
we're a target.

155
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,433
I've got the area covered.

156
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,894
All right, groups of two,
find somewhere safe within eyeshot.

157
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,207
When the world
was still the world,

158
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,668
I worked for an NGO.

159
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,463
Our mission was to deliver
medicine and food

160
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,882
to the Niger River Delta.

161
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,510
Bad people pointed guns
in my face every other week.

162
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,264
You're not bad people.

163
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,767
You're not going to kill us.

164
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,770
And we are definitely
not going to kill you.

165
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:31,106
Just because
we're good people

166
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,776
doesn't mean
we won't kill you.

167
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,113
If the five of them
aren't back in an hour...

168
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,284
I'll put a knife
in the base of your skull.

169
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,543
Glenn:
Eyes open, everybody.

170
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,421
Weapons up.

171
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:57,508
You see someone
coming at us, you fire.

172
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,426
Abraham:
Copy that.

173
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,350
So if we see someone,
we just shoot them?

174
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,852
It's a good question.

175
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,271
Michonne:
What if they're someone like us?

176
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,274
What if Aaron
is telling the truth?

177
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,902
What if they're someone
who has nothing to do with this?

178
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,738
Glenn: We're five people
walking with guns.

179
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,408
No one's coming up
to say hello.

180
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,993
But that's exactly what happened.

181
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:29,790
If it's someone like us,
we should be afraid of them.

182
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,001
He said he was
watching us, right?

183
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,463
It means he saw us yesterday.

184
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:37,714
And after everything
we've done,

185
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,134
why would he want us
to join his group?

186
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,681
People like us saved a priest.

187
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,270
Saved a girl who rolled up
up to the prison with the Governor.

188
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,816
Saved a crazy lady
with a sword.

189
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,112
He saw that.

190
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,115
I don't know what he saw.

191
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:16,003
( Judith crying )

192
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,550
( grunts )
Shh.

193
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,887
You did see the jar of applesauce
in my bag, right?

194
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,017
This isn't a trick.

195
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:32,019
This isn't about trying
to make you like me.

196
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:34,104
It's self-preservation.

197
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,690
Because if the roamers hear her
and come this way,

198
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,276
I know I'll be the first to go.

199
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:43,697
Shh, shh.

200
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:46,074
All right,
come here, come here.

201
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,869
Shh.

202
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,100
You think I'm trying
to poison your baby daughter?

203
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,022
I'm tied up and you've
already expressed

204
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,483
a willingness
to stab me in the head.

205
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,777
How would cruelly
killing your daughter in front of you

206
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:24,112
in any way help the situation?

207
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,823
Maybe she doesn't die.
Maybe she gets sick.

208
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,326
Maybe you're the only one
that can help her and I just lose.

209
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,787
I am the only one who can help her
because I have applesauce

210
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,956
and we all win.

211
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,042
I hate applesauce.

212
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,503
My mom used to make me
eat foods I didn't like

213
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,630
to make me more manly.

214
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,632
Salmon patties,
applesauce, and onions.

215
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,801
She was a very confused woman
who tried her damndest.

216
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,720
I just bring the jar to show
that we have apple trees nearby.

217
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,934
Like you said,
you'll be the first to go.

218
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,615
The community is big enough.

219
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,200
We can find a place
for you to live

220
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,953
where even when she cries,

221
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:16,540
no one, nothing can hear it
outside the walls.

222
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,212
You got 43 minutes.

223
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,798
( crying continues )

224
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,517
He was telling the truth.

225
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,489
( rustling )

226
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,200
Glenn:
Not one step closer, asshole!

227
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,960
( snarling )

228
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,757
I got 'em.

229
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,675
We got 'em.

230
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,559
Damn it!

231
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,612
Thanks.

232
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,596
All clear?

233
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,516
All clear.

234
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,150
Gracious Ignatius.

235
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,824
Oh, it has been a while.

236
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,368
I think I saw Rex
eat three cans one night.

237
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,204
Four.
( chuckles )

238
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,290
Son of a bitch knew
if he didn't toss 'em back,

239
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,543
I'd have come for 'em.

240
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,965
Back at the fire truck,

241
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,967
after Eugene...

242
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,140
did you think
I was gonna hurt you?

243
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,891
No.

244
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,769
It's not you.

245
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:03,248
This, this is ours now.

246
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:06,835
There's more than enough.

247
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:11,006
It's ours whether or not
we go to your camp.

248
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:14,426
What do you mean?
Why wouldn't we go?

249
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,095
Michonne:
If he were lying

250
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,514
or if he wanted to hurt us...

251
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,726
but he isn't...

252
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,979
and he doesn't.

253
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,192
We need this.

254
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,069
So we're going, all of us.

255
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:39,075
Somebody say something
if they feel differently.

256
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,579
Daryl:
I don't know, man.

257
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,625
This barn smells like horse shit.

258
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,089
Yeah.

259
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,342
We're going.

260
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,557
So where are we going?
Where's your camp?

261
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,228
Well, every time I've done this,

262
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:10,190
I've been behind the wheel
driving recruits back.

263
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,777
I believe you're good people.

264
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,111
I've bet my life on it.

265
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,906
I'm just not ready to bet
my friends' lives just yet.

266
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,574
You're not driving.

267
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:24,412
So if you want to get home,
you'll have to tell us how.

268
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,838
Go north on Route 16.

269
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,882
Michonne:
And then?

270
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,177
I'll tell you when we get there.

271
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,931
We'll take 23 north.

272
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,474
You'll give us
directions from there.

273
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:47,102
That's-- I don't know
how else to say it--

274
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,520
that's a bad idea.

275
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,105
We've cleared 16.

276
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,606
It'll be faster.

277
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,985
We'll take 23.

278
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,280
We leave at sundown.

279
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,782
We're doing this at night?

280
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,659
Rick:
Look, I know it's dangerous.

281
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:05,245
But it's better than
riding up to the gates during the day.

282
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:08,039
If it isn't safe, we need to get gone
before they know we're there.

283
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,333
No one is going to hurt you.

284
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:13,378
You're trying to protect your group,
but you're putting them in danger.

285
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:18,466
Tell me where the camp is,
we'll leave right now.

286
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,893
It's going to be a long night.

287
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,769
Eat.

288
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,147
Get some rest if you can.

289
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,151
( door opens )

290
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,868
( door closes )

291
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:58,506
I'm thinking you, me, and Glenn
drive with that guy.

292
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,301
Carl and Judith are safer in there.

293
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:06,014
You okay?

294
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,976
When you said
that we were going...

295
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,605
was that for real?

296
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,858
Or are you just trying to get this guy
to tell you where his camp is?

297
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,530
We're going.

298
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,532
Whatever it takes to get there.

299
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:28,370
Just as long as we get there.

300
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:34,542
When you first came up
on the walls outside Woodbury...

301
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,838
what did you hear?

302
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,340
Nothing.

303
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:43,218
And Terminus?

304
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:45,011
Nothing.

305
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,476
Sometime tonight,

306
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,813
we'll be outside his camp's walls.

307
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:57,232
And without seeing inside,

308
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,652
I'm gonna have to decide
whether to bring my family in.

309
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:06,700
He asked me before what it would take
for me to believe it was real.

310
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,246
Truth is...

311
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:16,042
I'm not sure if anything
could convince me to go in there.

312
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,588
But I'm gonna see.

313
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:25,635
I'm gonna see.

314
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:41,776
( glove compartment clicks )

315
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:59,169
Um, I'm trying to collect
all 50 states.

316
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:02,047
Put them all on a wall
in my house.

317
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,965
You have your own house?

318
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:05,300
Mm.

319
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:07,302
See for yourself.

320
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:42,087
Why don't you have
any pictures of your people?

321
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,672
Oh, I took a picture
of the whole group,

322
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,341
but I didn't get
the exposure right.

323
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:48,551
When I tried
to develop it later, it just--

324
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,053
Did you ask him the questions?

325
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,099
No.

326
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,355
How many walkers
have you killed?

327
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:03,566
I'm sorry, what?

328
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,235
How many?

329
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,200
I don't know.
A lot.

330
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:15,245
How many people?

331
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,082
Two.

332
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,127
Why?

333
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:25,421
Because they tried to kill me.

334
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,011
You were listening to us?

335
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,388
I already said
I was watching you.

336
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:35,056
- Yes, I was listening.
- It means his people

337
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,850
could have one, too.
They could've heard our plan.

338
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,560
- This isn't safe.
- Shit!

339
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,190
- Rick: Glenn!
- They were right behind us.

340
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:47,735
They would have hit us.
Now they can get out.

341
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:18,141
( all breathing heavily )

342
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,271
( walkers snarling )

343
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:26,232
I don't see them.

344
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,530
No, they're gone.
They got away.

345
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:35,533
Rick: All right, we'll circle back
and find them. Let's go.

346
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,706
- They're okay?
- Yeah.

347
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,963
All right, we can take a left
a couple of miles up 23.

348
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,465
- Jefferson Avenue.
- Jefferson Avenue.

349
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:53,676
- Aaron: We gotta get out of here.
- ( engine sputtering )

350
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:56,012
- Come on.
- Come on.

351
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,725
( snarling )

352
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,393
We got to get out of here.

353
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:05,063
Come on.

354
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:06,814
Let me see what I can see.

355
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,358
They're coming right for us.

356
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,569
- Yeah, we know.
- Glenn: Come on, come on!

357
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:23,831
We need to leave now.

358
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:27,085
Hold on.

359
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:32,840
Shit.

360
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,510
Who did that?

361
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:38,429
I need to leave.
This is over.

362
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,515
Let me out.
I need to get outta here. It's over.

363
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:41,975
- What's going on?
- Let me out!

364
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,476
Did you see that?

365
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:50,358
Michonne, leave him!
We need to find our people.

366
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,026
They saw that flare.
They'll think we shot it.

367
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:54,988
- This is how we find them.
- ( walkers snarling )

368
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,680
( gunshot )

369
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:25,143
Where's Glenn?

370
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:45,163
( grunting )

371
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:51,753
( panting )

372
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,929
- ( walker snarling )
- Aaron: Get off!

373
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:13,983
( knife slices )

374
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,787
( gunshots )

375
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:29,123
Run if you want.
I got other things to worry about.

376
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,209
We can make it together.

377
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:32,794
But we can only make it together.

378
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:37,131
You said that.
I was listening.

379
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:47,308
Rick:
Glenn!

380
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,310
He's got to be
somewhere around here.

381
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:50,812
Michonne:
Glenn!

382
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:54,315
( gun clicking )

383
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,822
( snarling )

384
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,592
( gunfire )

385
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:31,978
If you really wanna tie me up again,
that's fine, but hurry up.

386
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:36,274
There's no time.
We're going that way.

387
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:54,375
Where are they?

388
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,544
I don't know.

389
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:01,549
If this is a trap to get us
back where you want us,

390
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:04,051
your people are gonna
die tonight.

391
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:12,226
Rick: The flare was towards
the water tower.

392
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:16,439
( whistles )

393
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:23,070
( whistles )

394
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,865
( whistles )

395
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,376
Dad!

396
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,298
- Your sister okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

397
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:45,801
Aaron:
Eric? Eric?

398
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,388
- Eric?
- In here.

399
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,141
Eric!

400
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,856
Eric?

401
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,066
I'm okay.

402
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:01,817
It's like a volleyball injury.

403
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,195
It's a broken ankle.

404
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:05,821
At least that's what Maggie said.

405
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,740
I like her.

406
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,745
It's not a big deal.

407
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,291
Oh, my God.

408
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,835
I'll just go to the infirmary
when we get back.

409
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,212
Oh...

410
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:35,518
When I saw that flare go up, I--

411
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:38,145
I thought...

412
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:41,732
You were worried, were you?

413
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,443
Yeah.

414
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,654
( sighs )

415
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:48,990
This is your fault, you know?

416
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,495
Is that so?

417
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:56,664
Because I love you.

418
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:59,000
And because when I'm worried,
I do stupid things.

419
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,670
And when I do stupid things,
I wind up underneath a rust bucket

420
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:05,339
surrounded by roamers
who roll a rear passenger tire

421
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:07,675
onto my left ankle.

422
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,844
( chuckles )

423
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:11,929
Hey, something good
came out of today.

424
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:14,724
While I was waiting for you,
I searched through the neighborhood.

425
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,685
I found that.

426
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:28,195
You lost the license plates.

427
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:32,241
I lost the car.

428
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,535
( laughs )

429
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:36,162
Maybe it's for the best.

430
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:39,498
That monstrosity out front can run.

431
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:42,627
It's so ugly, it'll scare
the roamers away.

432
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,421
( laughing )

433
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:51,636
Hi. I'm Eric.

434
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,304
Rick.

435
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,391
It's okay.

436
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:08,903
( chatter )

437
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:11,739
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

438
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,574
Everyone.

439
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:20,831
Thank you.

440
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:26,128
You saved Eric.

441
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:29,882
I owe you.
All of you.

442
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:33,094
And I will make sure
that debt is paid in full

443
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:36,430
when we get
to our community.

444
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:38,808
When we get to Alexandria.

445
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,772
Now, I'm not sure about you,

446
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:49,110
but I'd rather not do
any more driving tonight.

447
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,738
Maybe we can hit the road
tomorrow morning.

448
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:55,324
That sounds fine.

449
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:56,784
But if we're staying
here for the night,

450
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:58,577
you're sleeping over there.

451
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,830
You really think
we gotta do that?

452
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:04,667
It's the safe play.
We don't know you.

453
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:07,086
The only way you're gonna stop me
from being with him right now

454
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:09,797
is by shooting me.

455
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,723
Whoa.

456
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:24,145
Rick, he told us
where the camp is.

457
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,940
And he really was only traveling
with one other person.

458
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,236
They're both unarmed.

459
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:35,740
One of them's got a broken ankle.

460
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,367
I want us to be safe, too.

461
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:48,502
I can't give up everything else.

462
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,548
I know what I said,

463
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:57,011
but it does matter.

464
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,105
All right.

465
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,625
- ( knocks )
- Yeah?

466
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:30,795
- ( pills rattle )
- Oh, um...

467
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,214
I know it's time
for another dose,

468
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,716
but I want to let him sleep
until we get home.

469
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:38,052
No, it's for you.

470
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,971
A few bottles.
Don't need to be stingy with 'em.

471
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,349
I know how bad those hurt.

472
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:45,351
Yeah.

473
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:47,853
Thank you.

474
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:50,856
Oh, your leg.

475
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,776
Did that happen before?

476
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,449
During.

477
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:03,619
Dad and me, car accident.

478
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:06,539
Rotters in the road.

479
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,708
I had a doctor.

480
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:13,963
Probably lucky I can even walk.

481
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:18,592
We have a pretty gifted
surgeon in Alexandria.

482
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,469
His name's Pete.

483
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:24,765
I've seen him do
some amazing things.

484
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,934
He might be able to help.

485
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,647
Yeah?

486
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,148
Yeah.

487
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:40,114
Yeah.

488
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:46,370
Seven-card stud.
Stares and squares.

489
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:49,874
It's aces, cuatros, neeners,
and two-eyed jacks.

490
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,544
Tara: So there's 14 wild cards?
Are you serious?

491
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:56,171
Serious as two copulating dogs.

492
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:04,972
Abraham.

493
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,224
Look.

494
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:17,234
Eyes on the road, champ.

495
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,707
How much longer we got?

496
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:35,377
Looks like we're a little
over halfway there. Why?

497
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,673
We can make it.

498
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:45,471
We can make it.

499
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,563
( slams )
Can't win.

500
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:57,691
Might as well paint it red,
put a ladder on it.

501
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,193
All we need
is another battery.

502
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:01,862
Where in the hell are we gonna
find another battery?

503
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,365
Right over here.

504
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:14,667
How'd you know
those were there?

505
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,002
Come on.

506
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:25,344
Michonne:
The fight's over.

507
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:29,348
You've gotta let it go.

508
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,687
I know it's hard.

509
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:38,065
After it's kept you...

510
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:41,902
warm and fed and...

511
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,405
alive.

512
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:49,201
But the fight...

513
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:54,164
it turns on you.

514
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,375
You've gotta let it go.

515
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:04,925
That's what Bob was trying to
tell me back at the church.

516
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,847
What to risk.

517
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:12,099
When it's safe.

518
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:15,686
When to let someone in.

519
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:19,189
( sighs )

520
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,776
The rules keep changing.

521
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:25,487
They did for me.

522
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:32,578
( engine starts )

523
00:39:32,746 --> 00:39:35,039
( cheering )

524
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:41,962
Before we get going, I gotta--

525
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,214
I gotta take a moment.

526
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:49,530
( children shouting,
laughing )

527
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,202
( people chatting )

528
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:08,340
You ready?

529
00:41:20,562 --> 00:41:22,855
Yeah. Yeah.

530
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:26,441
( turns off car )

531
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:47,379
Hey.
Hey, sweetheart.

532
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:53,468
Come here.

533
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,099
Even though you were wrong,

534
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,685
you were still right.

535
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:14,114
( chuckles )

536
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:17,159
Should we go?

537
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,876
( theme music playing )
