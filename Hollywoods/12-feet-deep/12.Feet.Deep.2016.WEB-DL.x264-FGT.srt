1
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,806
Yeah, hon, I'll try
to get out of here.

2
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,542
You little putz.

3
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,477
Not you, hon.

4
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,579
What are you making?

5
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,783
Turkey giblet casserole?

6
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,951
'My god.'

7
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,587
'Jesus.'

8
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,867
I think that belongs
in the lost and found.

9
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:24,236
Yeah. I was, I was
looking for the ID in there.

10
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,276
You know, I just
literally sent the report...

11
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:33,446
...to your parole officer
this morning.

12
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,947
I said good things about you.

13
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:40,519
'You finish off your shift
and you're done.'

14
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,623
...make sure you empty
the trash bins.

15
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:57,936
Oi! Watch it, rugrats.
This is not a playground.

16
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,742
Sugar high.

17
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,510
'Eww. What happened
to your skin?'

18
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:06,379
...hey, come here.

19
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,713
Why don't you get out of here,
you little shit?

20
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,617
- They're just kids.
- Bad breeding.

21
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:16,054
You look good.

22
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:22,795
Hey, the lockers were closed.
I saw your bag on the bleachers.

23
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,697
So I put my stuff in there.
Is it cool?

24
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:28,368
Cool. You coming in?
It's heated.

25
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:30,403
It's an upgrade
from what I remember.

26
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:32,971
The place remodeled.
A lot has changed.

27
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,707
Yeah.

28
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:48,620
Jonna, I'm glad you came.
It's been too long.

29
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:53,993
Well, you know, it was
either this or sit at home...

30
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:56,062
...and listen to mom bitch
about her stupid boyfriend.

31
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:57,697
What's his name again?
Phil or Steve?

32
00:04:57,698 --> 00:05:00,365
- Steve.
- Steve. Whatever.

33
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,805
So how long has it been?

34
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:09,342
Three months, two weeks
and 14 hours.

35
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:11,643
I'm proud of you.

36
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,879
To hell with this.

37
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,618
Remember sophomore year,
we use to bet...

38
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:19,919
...who could race around
the pool the fastest?

39
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,322
- Come on, Bree.
- Come on.

40
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:23,956
Maybe you could break
another swimming record.

41
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:25,558
Loser buys dinner.

42
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,927
Yeah, I'm, I'm
at minus five in the bank...

43
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,829
...so you're getting dinner
either way.

44
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,796
Deal.

45
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,807
'Come on, wimp.'

46
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,542
...you know,
I'm gonna own you, right?

47
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:45,176
- Yeah?
- So good on you.

48
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:58,223
Let's go, time to go.
We're closing up.

49
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:06,799
Ladies, we closing up.
You need to get out of the pool.

50
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,968
- You're open till 7:00.
- It's a holiday weekend.

51
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,938
You see all the signs
hanging up around here?

52
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:15,675
Some people need to learn
how to read.

53
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:18,410
Some people need to learn
how to kiss my ass.

54
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,687
There's something
i wanna show you.

55
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:29,155
Yeah?

56
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:30,757
Thank you all for coming.

57
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:32,892
Have a pleasant holiday weekend.

58
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,728
'The katea public pool
is now closed.'

59
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,597
- what are you looking for?
- My ring.

60
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:39,632
I, I had it right here.

61
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:42,701
- What ring?
- Just my ring.

62
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,106
Well, I mean, are you sure
you even brought it?

63
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:48,541
Maybe you left it at home
or something.

64
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:50,809
No, I'm positive.

65
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:56,448
- That means you too.
- One minute!

66
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,217
Let's go.

67
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,128
Hang on.

68
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,496
I think I can see
something down here.

69
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,470
- I don't see anything.
- Down by the hole right there.

70
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:21,140
Hey, how the hell
did you see that?

71
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,543
Well, I mean, is that it?

72
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:25,276
That's it.

73
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,120
Thank you very much for coming.

74
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:39,290
Have a good weekend.

75
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:44,462
Just get the hell out.

76
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:35,313
About damn time.

77
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,203
Are you okay?

78
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:07,707
God. God.

79
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,209
No, I'm not okay! I'm trapped
in a fucking pool, Bree!

80
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,012
We aren't trapped.

81
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:15,281
Shit, my ring's
still down there.

82
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,950
Screw your damn ring.

83
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,785
I'm sure
someone's still out there.

84
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,721
- Hello?
- Hello!

85
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:23,623
- We're in the pool!
- 'We're in the pool!'

86
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:26,258
...we're in here!
We're trapped in here!

87
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,426
'Hello!'

88
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,230
...god.

89
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,176
We're all alone.

90
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,379
Everyone's left.

91
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,713
No, they'll come back.

92
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:51,951
Are you dense? Everyone's left.

93
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:53,753
The pool's closed
for the holiday weekend.

94
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:56,389
We're stuck in here.
We're gonna die in here.

95
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,057
We're not gonna die.
Stop freaking out.

96
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:05,164
God, I feel nauseous.

97
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,465
Hey, hey, hey,
calm down, calm down.

98
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,406
Remind me to knock out that
manager when we get out of here.

99
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:15,675
This is horseshit.

100
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:18,711
My god, that bastard
did it on purpose.

101
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:22,915
Shit! I cannot believe
this is happening!

102
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,451
- Help! Somebody, help us!
- Hey, hey, hey. Jonna.

103
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:27,720
- Jonna, come on, come on!
- God!

104
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:30,722
It's too solid.
We can't break it.

105
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,827
We can, we can go
to the shallow end...

106
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:36,228
...and just try and push it up
from there, alright?

107
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:37,463
I don't know if it'll work...

108
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:40,066
...but we have to try
something, okay?

109
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:43,067
Yeah. Yeah, okay, let's go.

110
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,184
'On three.'

111
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:01,319
...one, two, three!

112
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:06,057
Useless!

113
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,962
We had to try.
I needed to see how solid it is.

114
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:13,099
Solid? It's made
of freakin' fiberglass.

115
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,834
Listen, we need to figure out
our options here.

116
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:16,435
Are you serious?

117
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:18,871
You're going to treat this like
one of your corporate projects?

118
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:22,041
Do I get a review after?
Can I be the team leader?

119
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:24,944
What would you rather do?
Scream your head off some more?

120
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:27,278
Fine. What now?

121
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,782
We need to check
all the seals and edges.

122
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:32,184
Maybe there's a weak spot
somewhere.

123
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:35,319
- Yeah?
- Yeah, okay. Let's do it.

124
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,453
Yuck, gross.

125
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,146
'Hey, I found something.'

126
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,417
...it's a hole.

127
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,257
It's thick. We need something...

128
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:46,959
...to push through,
so we can widen it.

129
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,460
Yeah, yeah, okay, I'll just go...

130
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,496
...and grab my tool belt.

131
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,565
Get out of the way.

132
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:55,100
'Piece of shit!'

133
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:57,702
'come on! '

134
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:01,140
...real productive.

135
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:03,209
Why is there a hole, anyway?
A peephole?

136
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,110
Condensation hole or air duct,
i don't know.

137
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:07,980
Or maybe so people
don't get stuck?

138
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:09,714
Idiots.

139
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,618
Like I said, we need something.

140
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:14,887
I can't believe
this is happening.

141
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:18,689
Hey, just keep looking. Come on.

142
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,320
Well?

143
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:26,292
No use.

144
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:30,529
Just let me rest.
Think for a sec.

145
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,464
What do you think the worst way
to die would be?

146
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:34,333
'Quit being morbid.'

147
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:36,234
...starvation?

148
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,705
- Drowning?
- Stop.

149
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:41,307
Sharks?

150
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:43,008
Probably being eaten alive
by sharks.

151
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:45,344
I mean, that's all
we're missing, right?

152
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:48,579
- David.
- What about him?

153
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,750
He proposed.
I was gonna tell you.

154
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,621
He'll figure this out.
He'll call the police...

155
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,057
...when he notices I'm gone.

156
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:00,025
It's been more
than an hour, Bree.

157
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:02,728
We just have to wait.

158
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:05,097
Right. Okay, yeah, alright.

159
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:09,335
I mean, let's just,...

160
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:12,538
...kick back and relax
and, and wait...

161
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:15,274
...for your knight
in shining armor to ride in...

162
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:18,410
...on his, on his white horse
and rescue us.

163
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:20,679
What is wrong with you?

164
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,980
Nothing. Nothing at all.

165
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,122
This isn't my fault, you know?

166
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:32,490
Right, 'cause you're perfect.

167
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,961
Is that what this is about?

168
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,466
Do you think
rehab was easy for me?

169
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:43,068
Going through that
all over again?

170
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:45,770
- Jonna...
- Know what the worst part was?

171
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:52,610
It was coming home
to find you not there.

172
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,748
It sucked.

173
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:58,117
I'm sorry.

174
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:00,651
It's just
i have my own life now.

175
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,690
Can't you take care of yourself?

176
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:08,027
- Apparently, I can't.
- That's not what I meant.

177
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:09,661
No?

178
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:12,564
No, did you just mean
to, to rub it in a bit?

179
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:15,634
Just a little, you know,
brag about your..

180
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:18,237
Your giant diamond ring.

181
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:21,373
Tell me about how wonderful
your life is with David.

182
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,774
You've always been like that.

183
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:28,647
You did it, didn't you?

184
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:31,517
You saw the ring in my bag
and you threw it in the water.

185
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:35,220
How could you, jonna?
Look what you've done to us!

186
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,854
Jesus!

187
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:18,028
Come on.

188
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:23,601
Shit!

189
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:29,974
Are you okay?

190
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:34,713
- Yeah, I'll survive.
- 'We can't keep fighting.'

191
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:36,782
...we need to work together
and figure a way out.

192
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,852
Yeah, like that's possible.

193
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:41,720
The grate at the bottom,
i think it might be loose.

194
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:44,423
- Maybe we can pull it off.
- Yeah, and then?

195
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:46,625
It's heavy.

196
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:47,860
It might be able
to break the cover...

197
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:49,828
...if we can find the right spot.

198
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:53,398
Okay, great, Bree. Why don't
you try and pry it off then?

199
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,966
I did. It won't budge.
I'm not strong enough.

200
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,171
And what? You think I am?

201
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:02,441
Well, if we tried together
or, or we take turns.

202
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:04,243
Sounds crazy.

203
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:07,146
Look, if you're still scared
of getting your hair stuck...

204
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:10,415
I'm not scared, okay?

205
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,817
It just sounds pointless.

206
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,087
You have another idea?

207
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,992
Was that..

208
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,830
It came from outside the pool.

209
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:27,131
By the bleachers.

210
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,444
- It's David. It has to be.
- Lot a help that does us.

211
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,011
'Maybe we can get to it.'

212
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,254
...here. Another air duct.

213
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:50,923
If we could just make it
big enough to get to the...

214
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:53,592
We already tried that, MacGyver.

215
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:56,328
Can you just think
one positive thing, please?

216
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:59,530
Yeah, okay, sure,
I'm positive this truly sucks.

217
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:01,967
Yeah, hey, it's me again.

218
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:03,802
Yeah, don't forget
i have that dinner tonight...

219
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:06,338
...so, don't wait up.

220
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:08,473
Talk to you when I get home,
okay? Love you.

221
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:10,508
Yeah, bye.

222
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,518
- What are you doing now?
- 'Something useful.'

223
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:22,152
...damn it!

224
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:55,119
Told you it was a stupid idea.

225
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:59,591
This whole day
has been a stupid idea.

226
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,693
Right. Who'd wanna hang out
with a screw-up like me, right?

227
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:07,565
Maybe you're right.

228
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:31,055
How long before
he starts to worry?

229
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,292
No idea.

230
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,195
Great.

231
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,702
What just happened?

232
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:46,203
Must be on a timer.

233
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:52,376
You got to be kidding me.
Come on!

234
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,656
He keeps calling.

235
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,961
He's gonna get worried.
He has to.

236
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:12,497
Yeah, and then what?

237
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,198
I don't know.

238
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,069
Nobody knows
we're down here, Bree...

239
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:20,405
...and when they find out,
it's gonna be too late.

240
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:23,841
Can we not argue about this
for, like, the 100th time?

241
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:29,514
I never liked him.

242
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,084
I don't understand why you
would agree to marry that chump.

243
00:22:32,085 --> 00:22:33,752
You're so much better than him.

244
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:35,921
Don't get started on David.

245
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:37,522
'It's so typical of you.'

246
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,057
...you get in a hard spot
and you start digging...

247
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:41,760
...at everyone around you
until you strike a nerve.

248
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:43,927
I've had enough.

249
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:01,012
What is it?

250
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:02,913
A headache.

251
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,820
You can't lie to me.

252
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:11,755
'Your eyes are bugging out.
You can barely stand.'

253
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:16,161
...my blood sugar's low.

254
00:23:16,162 --> 00:23:19,096
- 'I'm diabetic.'
- What?

255
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:23,902
'I need my shot.'

256
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,003
...it's in my purse.

257
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,808
You're making this up, right?

258
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:31,143
Why would I?

259
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:33,812
I don't know. Sympathy?

260
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:35,480
That's a page out of your book.

261
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:36,915
Not everybody thinks
the way you do.

262
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:40,017
Come on. Don't fuck with me.
That's not funny.

263
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,957
I'm not.
I was diagnosed three years ago.

264
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,794
Jesus.

265
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,299
Why, why didn't you t-tell me?

266
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,737
Would it have mattered?

267
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:06,077
I'm not a doctor, Bree.
What does this mean?

268
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:08,447
It means I need my shot soon.

269
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,682
Or?

270
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:14,251
- I could fall into a coma.
- Jesus.

271
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,494
Okay.

272
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:25,929
We're gonna get you
your shot, okay?

273
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:01,431
'Let me see.'

274
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:14,044
...does it ever hurt?

275
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:17,649
I don't feel anything, actually.

276
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,983
It's like I'm dead there.

277
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:27,659
We never talked about it.

278
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,694
What's to talk about?

279
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,562
Are you serious?

280
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:36,900
I didn't see it like you did.

281
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:40,739
'I only remember it
after it was over.'

282
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,009
- don't.
- That smell.

283
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,644
It's like it never went away,...

284
00:25:45,645 --> 00:25:47,646
...you know,
i still smell it sometimes.

285
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:49,981
Just stop.

286
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:53,084
I wish I never looked in there.

287
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:55,887
God, his skin, it was all black...

288
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,622
...and flaking off like paper.

289
00:25:57,623 --> 00:25:59,591
Why are you still talking
about this?

290
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:01,893
I had a counselor
in rehab, Margaret.

291
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:04,796
She said I should talk
about this stuff.

292
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:07,766
She your mother now?

293
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:10,335
She's kind of a douche,
actually, with terrible teeth...

294
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:12,871
...but she's right.

295
00:26:12,872 --> 00:26:15,172
Tell me what happened.

296
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:21,246
You know what happened.

297
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:24,015
I know what mom told me
and I pieced together...

298
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:25,917
...the bits and pieces
you've told me over the years...

299
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:28,285
...but I don't know
the whole story.

300
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,623
Dad was a monster.
Plain and simple.

301
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:40,098
He came in that night drunk.

302
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,701
You could smell it off him.

303
00:26:42,702 --> 00:26:45,003
'Every time he breathed'

304
00:26:45,004 --> 00:26:49,072
...it filled the room with that
rotten stench of whisky.

305
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,345
He lit a cigarette
and just passed out.

306
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:02,687
He must have fallen
against the pillow because..

307
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:05,222
'...because you could see
the fire started about there..'

308
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:09,694
...right by his head.

309
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:12,230
'It started fanning out
like a circle.'

310
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:14,131
'just burning.'

311
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,736
...he didn't scream or anything.

312
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:19,337
He was so damn drunk
he didn't even notice...

313
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:21,638
...he was burning to death.

314
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:26,576
I pulled at him.
Tried to wake him up.

315
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,049
Here we are.

316
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:33,383
It must have hurt so bad.

317
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:38,221
Not until after.

318
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:41,692
When it was happening, it was..

319
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:46,296
It was just like ice
sliding over my skin..

320
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:50,033
Numbing me.

321
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:55,305
It was like a release.

322
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:01,279
My god.

323
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,714
I told you someone would come.

324
00:28:02,715 --> 00:28:04,514
Come on, hurry!

325
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,118
Help! Help, we're in here!

326
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:43,254
Come on!

327
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:45,655
- 'Help!'
- 'Help, help us!'

328
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,061
...what the hell are you two
doing in there?

329
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,396
We got trapped.
Can you let us out?

330
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:56,868
Yeah. Hang on a minute.

331
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:59,771
My god. My god!
Thank god you're here!

332
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:02,407
My god! We've been
trapped in here for hours.

333
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:04,876
'My sister's ring got caught
in the drain'

334
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:07,378
'and we tried to get it out
and that idiot manager'

335
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:09,546
'closed the top on us.'

336
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:15,887
...it's so crazy that you're here.
I can't believe it!

337
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:17,487
What's your name?

338
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:28,233
- I'll be right back.
- Where, where is she going?

339
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:30,600
Maybe she's just gone to see
how to open the cover.

340
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,371
Okay, yeah, okay.

341
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:05,436
Never heard of two grown women...

342
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:08,171
...getting themselves
stuck in a pool before.

343
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:11,376
I know. We're idiots, right?

344
00:30:11,377 --> 00:30:14,479
My daughter did something
stupid like this once.

345
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,414
'She got her hand
caught in a drain'

346
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:19,584
'and I called the plumber
for like 100 bucks'

347
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:22,385
...to come out and take
the whole damn thing apart.

348
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:25,590
Yeah.

349
00:30:25,591 --> 00:30:28,258
That wasn't even the stupidest
thing she ever did.

350
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,130
- So can you get us out?
- Yeah.

351
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:34,165
What's your name, honey?

352
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:37,101
Bree. My sister's jonna.

353
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:38,403
'What kind of new age names.'

354
00:30:38,404 --> 00:30:41,271
'are, are you even from here?'

355
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:45,143
Wh-what's with all
the questions?

356
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:47,979
Are you, are you
gonna let us out or not?

357
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:51,681
Be polite. I have your phone
and it's blinkin'.

358
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,885
Looks like it needs a password.

359
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:01,558
Are you, are you serious?

360
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,896
'Well, it might be important.'

361
00:31:04,897 --> 00:31:08,633
...maybe somebody's looking for you
or worried about you.

362
00:31:08,634 --> 00:31:11,202
A-are you helping us?

363
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:14,304
Yes, I'm helping you.
That's why I need the password.

364
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:18,076
- Don't do it.
- She could call the police.

365
00:31:18,077 --> 00:31:20,044
'I just wanna get
the hell out of here.'

366
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,180
...yeah, okay, fine.

367
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:24,414
'7397.'

368
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:31,289
...what-what's so funny?

369
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:34,626
'Well, Bree, you're like
a real cutie pie?'

370
00:31:34,627 --> 00:31:38,962
...you and the guy with the wavy,
gravy brown hair.

371
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:46,537
'There's a lot of missed calls
and texts.'

372
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:48,673
'i wonder who they're from?'

373
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:51,341
...miss, please,
there's no reason to do this.

374
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,580
There's always a reason
for everything.

375
00:31:58,316 --> 00:31:59,984
'Yeah, hey, it's me again.'

376
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:01,452
'yeah, don't forget
i have that dinner tonight'

377
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:04,022
'so, don't wait up.'

378
00:32:04,023 --> 00:32:06,925
'talk to you when I get home,
okay? Love you.'

379
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:08,459
'babe, where are you?'

380
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:12,230
'did your psycho sister
kidnap you or something?'

381
00:32:12,231 --> 00:32:14,299
'alright, call me, love you.'

382
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,935
'wow! Somebody's got drama.'

383
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:18,469
...can you, please,
just call him back?

384
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:21,606
Quit being such a bitch!
Why are you doing this?

385
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:22,974
'Come on!'

386
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:26,177
...wow. What a mouth on you.

387
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:28,513
No wonder why David thinks
you're a psycho.

388
00:32:28,514 --> 00:32:31,516
'Let's see if your sister
has any pictures of you.'

389
00:32:31,517 --> 00:32:35,987
'yeah, I bet that's you
in the tattoo, isn't it?'

390
00:32:35,988 --> 00:32:38,289
I bet that's not even
your only one, is it?

391
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,292
Do you have a tramp stamp,
jonna?

392
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,594
Give the lucky boys
something to look at?

393
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:45,229
What is she doing?

394
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,432
I'm gonna kick
the living shit out of you!

395
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:50,535
Come on! What are you doing?
It's not funny!

396
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:53,670
'Simmer down. I don't think
you're gonna be doing anything.'

397
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,973
'here's the thing.'

398
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,346
...it's really tough
in the real world, you know.

399
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:03,715
And I just got out of lockup,
like, nine months ago...

400
00:33:03,716 --> 00:33:05,550
'and I, I can't get a real job'

401
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:08,987
'and, and even this stupid crap
job cut me back to part-time'

402
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:11,089
...and that's why
I'm so behind on rent.

403
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,257
I..

404
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:16,459
All these stupid bills, I..

405
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:21,165
What does that mean?

406
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,700
'It means
this is an opportunity.'

407
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:25,303
'and if you see one
and you don't take it'

408
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:27,171
'then you're stupid.'

409
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:31,509
...so I'm gonna need your pin code
for your bank card, Bree.

410
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,711
'God, you crazy bitch!'

411
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:37,081
...yeah, an attitude like that...

412
00:33:37,082 --> 00:33:39,784
...is probably what got you here
in the first place.

413
00:33:39,785 --> 00:33:42,387
Look, I'm sure
we can figure this out.

414
00:33:42,388 --> 00:33:45,056
Just, just promise
you'll let us out of here.

415
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:47,125
Nope.

416
00:33:47,126 --> 00:33:49,694
I'm not promising you nothing
until you give me the code.

417
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:52,030
'Don't do it.'

418
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:53,863
'don't do it.'

419
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,371
'well?'

420
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:05,575
...what's it gonna be?

421
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,514
Stubborn.

422
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,856
Things never end well
for stubborn girls.

423
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,200
Great.

424
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:31,536
Where did she go?

425
00:34:31,537 --> 00:34:33,271
'To hell, I hope.'

426
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:35,306
...we have to cooperate.

427
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:37,208
No, we don't have
to do anything.

428
00:34:37,209 --> 00:34:39,143
You act like we have
a choice here.

429
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:40,445
She's blackmailing us.

430
00:34:40,446 --> 00:34:42,746
Do you have any other ideas?

431
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:48,219
We've waited it out
this long, okay?

432
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,221
What's few more hours?

433
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:52,522
Jonna, I don't think I can.

434
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:09,340
'You know, I used to be
just like you girls.'

435
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:11,708
'i was a fashion snob too.'

436
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:17,013
'yep, buying fancy outfits
to relax at the pool.'

437
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,517
...just like you.

438
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:26,656
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

439
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:29,427
'I did nothing.'

440
00:35:29,428 --> 00:35:31,762
...but you know, I hope you know...

441
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:34,499
...it does get real nippy
here at night, you know.

442
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,636
The whole, like, desert air,
it's, it's chilly.

443
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,872
'It could, like, cut you
right to the bone.'

444
00:35:40,873 --> 00:35:44,876
...do you have any idea
how much trouble you're in?

445
00:35:44,877 --> 00:35:47,845
I'm fine, actually.
I'm a little worried about you...

446
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:51,182
'cause you really seem like the
string-bikini type, aren't you?

447
00:35:51,183 --> 00:35:53,950
What the hell is this freakshow
talking about?

448
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:58,922
The heater. She turned it off.

449
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:01,859
This isn't a joke!

450
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,828
You're going to kill us,
do you understand?

451
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:08,900
Yeah, I never said it was.

452
00:36:08,901 --> 00:36:11,402
But unless you think
you can get through the night...

453
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:14,338
...without freezing,
i suggest you hand over...

454
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,873
...the pin code for your atm.

455
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:22,545
Just promise
you'll let us out of here.

456
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:27,685
I swear on my father's grave.

457
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,886
God, she's lying!

458
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:35,225
- We don't have a choice.
- There's always a choice.

459
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,904
'It's 6530.'

460
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,745
...see, that wasn't so bad.

461
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:58,549
I swear to god, lady,
if you're lying to us..

462
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,418
'Stay as warm
as you can in there.'

463
00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:02,253
...come on, you have to come back.

464
00:37:02,254 --> 00:37:04,922
You're gonna kill us!

465
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:07,290
She'll be back. She has to.

466
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:11,828
God. I swear to god,
when I get my hands on her..

467
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:16,334
Hey, hey. Just come here.

468
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:17,735
- 'Come here.'
- I'm gonna kill her.

469
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,669
Just hold on.

470
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:42,225
'It's so quiet.'

471
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:47,263
...peaceful.

472
00:37:49,001 --> 00:37:51,801
No wonder we used to come here
when we were kids.

473
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:01,711
Bree.

474
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:04,849
Bree.

475
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,285
I'm here.

476
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:09,586
Just hang in there, okay?

477
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:13,723
Has she come back?

478
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:20,196
She will.

479
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:24,367
I don't trust her.

480
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,940
When do you trust anyone?

481
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:32,677
I'm really not in the mood
for a lecture, okay?

482
00:38:32,678 --> 00:38:34,978
I don't have the energy
to give one.

483
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:46,757
We can't just sit here
and freeze to death.

484
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:49,058
We tried everything.

485
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:54,397
'No.'

486
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:58,401
...the filter grate,
i never tried it.

487
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:02,405
Maybe I can get it off.

488
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:06,644
You'll be okay if I leave you
for, like, two minutes?

489
00:39:06,645 --> 00:39:08,378
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

490
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:13,149
Don't go anywhere.

491
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,821
Just stay there.

492
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,838
Bree?

493
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,275
Bree!

494
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,081
Bree.

495
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:18,883
Come on, Bree, wake up, wake up.

496
00:40:18,884 --> 00:40:21,585
Wake up, come on!

497
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:22,953
God, you scared
the crap out of me.

498
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:25,089
Are you okay?

499
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:27,156
Did you get it?

500
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,393
'I couldn't.'

501
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:33,730
I'm useless.

502
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,799
You tried.

503
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:39,802
'No.'

504
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:42,973
I'm a coward.

505
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:44,941
Don't say that.

506
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:51,047
God, this is all my fault.

507
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,151
God, I wish
i could take it back.

508
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:58,387
'Hey. Jonna, hey.'

509
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,424
...we can't lose hope.

510
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:08,498
I wish I was more like you.

511
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,367
Hey.

512
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,270
You are.

513
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:18,441
You just don't believe it.

514
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,897
You're wasting energy.

515
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:43,133
I need to move.

516
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:45,868
It's the only thing
that keeps me warm.

517
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,440
So this counselor in rehab..

518
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,245
'...did she ever talk
about what happened?'

519
00:41:54,246 --> 00:41:56,614
...stop.

520
00:41:56,615 --> 00:41:58,883
I thought we were supposed
to talk about these things.

521
00:41:58,884 --> 00:42:01,884
We're supposed to talk about it
doesn't mean that I want to.

522
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:08,025
Yeah, you mean only
when it's convenient for you.

523
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,259
Yeah, sure, whatever.

524
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:17,034
What are you really afraid of?

525
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:19,001
I don't know.

526
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,338
Yeah, you do.

527
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:28,311
You really wanna know?

528
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:31,314
Yeah.

529
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:35,051
Monsters.

530
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,926
They're everywhere.

531
00:42:41,927 --> 00:42:43,928
So what?

532
00:42:43,929 --> 00:42:46,263
'Suicide's the answer.'

533
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:49,166
...you don't know what it's like.

534
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:52,069
It's like I have this..

535
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:55,438
Giant, black..

536
00:42:57,274 --> 00:42:59,609
'...ugly thing inside me.'

537
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,981
...rumbling, just eating at me.

538
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:10,620
You don't have
to be afraid anymore.

539
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,423
'It's in the past.'

540
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:21,031
...yeah, well, you gotta stop
eating Chinese food, okay?

541
00:43:21,032 --> 00:43:24,000
All those, those fortune cookies
are rotting your brain.

542
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:33,643
All those things dad did to us.

543
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:38,314
I'm sorry it lasted so long.

544
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:43,519
Hey, if he didn't die, it would
have kept going forever, so..

545
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:47,758
It didn't.

546
00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:50,393
He's still in my head.

547
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:55,366
All the time.

548
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:57,533
It gets better.

549
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,739
'He's gone.'

550
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,073
...keep reminding yourself that.

551
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:18,322
What the..

552
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:21,392
'How long have you
been there for?'

553
00:44:21,393 --> 00:44:23,093
a while now.

554
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:25,962
Sounds like you girls have been
through some stuff.

555
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:29,266
You think
that makes you special?

556
00:44:29,267 --> 00:44:30,868
'Alright, so you, you got
what you wanted.'

557
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:33,137
...you gonna let us out
of here or not?

558
00:44:33,138 --> 00:44:34,438
Yeah, maybe
you should have mentioned...

559
00:44:34,439 --> 00:44:36,940
...you only had 80 bucks
in your account.

560
00:44:36,941 --> 00:44:39,376
'A lot of good
that's gonna do me.'

561
00:44:39,377 --> 00:44:42,011
...god, are you joking?

562
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:46,582
You swore
on your father's grave!

563
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:50,586
'Listen.'

564
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:54,458
...my sister's really not
doing so well.

565
00:44:54,459 --> 00:44:57,361
'She needs her shot.
It's in her purse.'

566
00:44:57,362 --> 00:45:00,062
'she's diabetic,
do you understand?'

567
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:04,368
- 'she could die.'
- Yeah, right.

568
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:07,471
You will say anything
to get out of there right now.

569
00:45:07,472 --> 00:45:10,274
I'm not lying. I'm serious.

570
00:45:10,275 --> 00:45:12,743
Come on. You don't want blood
on your hands, do you?

571
00:45:12,744 --> 00:45:13,977
Boo-hoo. Shut up.

572
00:45:13,978 --> 00:45:15,412
I'm borderline diabetic...

573
00:45:15,413 --> 00:45:18,449
...and my doctor says
i don't even need anything.

574
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:21,485
So maybe that's just
for lazy people.

575
00:45:21,486 --> 00:45:24,254
I have a different kind.

576
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:26,256
'Can you just let us out,
please?'

577
00:45:26,257 --> 00:45:28,125
...you know, I don't really see why...

578
00:45:28,126 --> 00:45:31,495
I'm expected to do you
any favors.

579
00:45:31,496 --> 00:45:35,099
I mean, this whole thing
just pisses me off, you know.

580
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,868
You put me in this position
'cause you're so stupid.

581
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:40,104
This is not our fault.

582
00:45:40,105 --> 00:45:43,806
- 'Don't give me that crap.'
- What do you want?

583
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:48,879
The world doesn't
owe you any favors...

584
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,014
...and neither do I.

585
00:45:51,015 --> 00:45:56,252
Come on, just open this cover
and let us out!

586
00:45:57,956 --> 00:46:01,357
You know what, come here.
Come over here.

587
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:10,901
'Can you hear me?'

588
00:46:10,902 --> 00:46:13,602
I might just leave you
both in there to die.

589
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:53,310
She's insane.

590
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:55,546
I told you she was.

591
00:46:55,547 --> 00:46:58,115
We can't reason
with someone like this.

592
00:46:58,116 --> 00:47:00,483
We need to figure out
another way.

593
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:12,895
What are you doing?

594
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:21,837
It's a little surprise.

595
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,816
I really don't think
this is a good idea.

596
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,821
Just trust me for once.

597
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:07,950
I'm so sorry.

598
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:11,687
'I don't know what to do.'

599
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:18,095
...well, I told you, girls,
everything happens for a reason.

600
00:48:18,096 --> 00:48:20,030
'I really need to tell
you something, okay'

601
00:48:20,031 --> 00:48:21,365
'but I don't want
my sister to hear.'

602
00:48:21,366 --> 00:48:23,666
...it can only be you, okay?

603
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:26,569
Go ahead.

604
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:33,909
Yeah. Okay. Come on.

605
00:48:37,515 --> 00:48:39,582
I-i-i can't even hear you.

606
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:51,227
Go fuck yourself!

607
00:49:08,578 --> 00:49:11,114
I got her!

608
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:13,015
I got her!

609
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:32,468
Stupid girl.

610
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:43,347
You don't listen to me,
you don't listen.

611
00:49:43,348 --> 00:49:46,383
'You never listen to me.
You wanna ignore me?'

612
00:49:46,384 --> 00:49:48,652
...serves you right.

613
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:50,287
You think this is funny?

614
00:49:50,288 --> 00:49:51,555
You got what you've deserved.

615
00:49:51,556 --> 00:49:53,557
Now you're gonna let us
out of here!

616
00:49:53,558 --> 00:49:57,527
You are messing
with the wrong woman.

617
00:49:57,528 --> 00:50:00,297
'And I'm sorry, Bree, but I'm
sure this ain't the first time'

618
00:50:00,298 --> 00:50:03,032
'you're gonna get punished
for something your sister did.'

619
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:11,907
...well, this is for you.

620
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:26,722
- You smell that?
- Chlorine.

621
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,999
Shoot.

622
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:40,936
It must be the cleaning system.

623
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:46,008
Block the jets!

624
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:25,481
You have anything
you wanna say to me now?

625
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:04,853
You had enough yet, girls?

626
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:09,792
The hole.

627
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:12,127
The hole.

628
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,505
Let us out!

629
00:52:21,506 --> 00:52:24,072
What's that?
I can't really hear you.

630
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:28,411
Come on, please.

631
00:52:28,412 --> 00:52:30,714
It's, you're killing us!

632
00:52:30,715 --> 00:52:34,650
Please!

633
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:06,616
I can flip that switch
at any time, ladies.

634
00:53:06,617 --> 00:53:09,651
You understand? You hear me?

635
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,255
Yes.

636
00:53:12,256 --> 00:53:13,924
Speak up.

637
00:53:13,925 --> 00:53:17,493
'We understand.
Can you please just let us out?'

638
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:22,232
I'm the one in control here now.

639
00:53:22,233 --> 00:53:24,334
We're sorry.

640
00:53:24,335 --> 00:53:29,206
And all these life lessons,
they're not free.

641
00:53:29,207 --> 00:53:30,907
'You have something I want.'

642
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:34,211
...you already have everything.

643
00:53:34,212 --> 00:53:37,614
You, you have my phone,
my purse.

644
00:53:37,615 --> 00:53:39,915
'What else do you want?'

645
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:43,085
I want that ring.

646
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:47,691
No, that's her engagement ring.
She's getting married.

647
00:53:47,692 --> 00:53:50,727
Let me tell you
something about marriage.

648
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:52,729
It's overrated.

649
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,764
That's not right.

650
00:53:54,765 --> 00:53:57,834
You're gonna thank me
in a couple of years. Trust me.

651
00:53:57,835 --> 00:54:01,838
I am, I am honestly,
i am begging you. Please!

652
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:04,608
You can't throw into it.
Bree, please.

653
00:54:04,609 --> 00:54:07,477
Please, I'm begging you.
I'm begging you, Bree.

654
00:54:07,478 --> 00:54:09,912
I just wanna go home.

655
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:14,816
Bree.

656
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:32,968
'Pawn shop will give me
something decent for this.'

657
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:38,508
I'm sure you feel pretty low,
but trust me...

658
00:54:38,509 --> 00:54:40,777
...there's always somebody
lower than you.

659
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:43,647
Can you let us out now?

660
00:54:43,648 --> 00:54:46,081
I'll let you out
when I'm good and ready.

661
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:51,687
I'm so sorry.

662
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,591
I don't wanna talk.

663
00:54:57,594 --> 00:54:59,294
Bree.

664
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,999
I just wanna be alone.

665
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:07,729
Jonna!

666
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:10,365
Is that you?

667
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:32,087
Miss, is that you?

668
00:56:34,792 --> 00:56:38,495
It's people. It's-it's people.

669
00:56:38,496 --> 00:56:40,295
People..

670
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:45,033
Here! We're in here!

671
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:54,309
Baby, it's, it's okay.

672
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:57,312
'You're safe.'

673
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:07,924
...it's okay.

674
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:10,025
You're safe, baby.

675
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:13,762
Where's jonna?

676
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:21,137
Baby, you can't leave her.

677
00:57:21,138 --> 00:57:22,939
I'm so tired.

678
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,040
She needs you.

679
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:31,346
I can't, I can't do it.

680
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:36,184
Jonna.

681
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:45,026
Jonna?

682
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:57,806
What are you doing?

683
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,711
Just leave it alone.

684
00:58:01,712 --> 00:58:04,379
Jonna, you can't
break on me now.

685
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:08,016
We're gonna survive this.

686
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:13,223
What if we do?

687
00:58:13,224 --> 00:58:17,060
You survive this
and you, you have David.

688
00:58:17,061 --> 00:58:21,564
You have your life
to go back to, okay?

689
00:58:21,565 --> 00:58:24,232
There's nothing out there
for me.

690
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:28,937
I die
and no one will even notice.

691
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,676
It'll be a relief for you
and for mom and for everyone.

692
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:36,513
That's not true.

693
00:58:36,514 --> 00:58:38,814
That is not true.

694
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:43,887
I need you here, please.

695
00:58:43,888 --> 00:58:47,823
Bree, I don't want you
to have to carry me anymore.

696
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:52,427
Jonna, we're sisters.
We carry each other.

697
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,198
Fuck.

698
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:57,200
You'd really just leave me here?

699
00:58:57,201 --> 00:58:58,935
No.

700
00:58:58,936 --> 00:59:01,604
You kill yourself,
you kill both of us...

701
00:59:01,605 --> 00:59:03,540
...and I'm not ready to die.

702
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:05,875
And neither are you.

703
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:08,376
I wanna hear you say
you're gonna make it.

704
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:12,480
Jonna, I wanna hear you say it.

705
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,183
Okay.

706
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,587
I'm gonna make it.

707
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:23,058
Bree, I'm gonna make it.

708
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:26,195
I'm so sorry.

709
00:59:26,196 --> 00:59:27,931
You don't have to feel sorry.

710
00:59:27,932 --> 00:59:31,568
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it's not your fault.

711
00:59:31,569 --> 00:59:34,369
I'm so sorry for everything.

712
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:10,673
'Babe, where are you?
It's late. I just got home.'

713
01:00:10,674 --> 01:00:11,975
'you should have been
back hours ago.'

714
01:00:11,976 --> 01:00:14,744
'i called jonna, your mom.'

715
01:00:14,745 --> 01:00:16,912
'where are you?'

716
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:20,617
'Bree, I'm calling the cops.
This isn't like you.'

717
01:00:20,618 --> 01:00:22,652
'if you get this,
call me back right away.'

718
01:00:22,653 --> 01:00:25,355
'if I don't hear back in five,
I'm dialing 911.'

719
01:00:25,356 --> 01:00:27,522
'okay, I'm serious.'

720
01:00:28,992 --> 01:00:30,592
'Bree.'

721
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:50,346
...god, when we get out of here...

722
01:00:50,347 --> 01:00:54,317
I'm gonna eat
the entire Thanksgiving Turkey...

723
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:56,351
...all by myself.

724
01:00:57,887 --> 01:01:00,322
Well, here, give me your hand.

725
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:04,927
We need to figure out
what to say to her...

726
01:01:04,928 --> 01:01:07,397
...when she comes back.

727
01:01:07,398 --> 01:01:09,365
Well, if she comes back.

728
01:01:09,366 --> 01:01:10,700
She will.

729
01:01:10,701 --> 01:01:12,135
People like her
need people like us...

730
01:01:12,136 --> 01:01:14,804
...to feel good about themselves.

731
01:01:14,805 --> 01:01:17,739
Yeah, like a psycho version
of nurse ratched.

732
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:24,414
When she comes back,
you follow my lead, alright?

733
01:01:24,415 --> 01:01:26,614
I will. I promise.

734
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:31,453
Miss?

735
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:34,990
Yeah, it's me.

736
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:40,495
Thank you for coming back.

737
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:46,035
I'm not one of those monsters
you keep talking about.

738
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:48,771
No, you're not.
We know that now.

739
01:01:48,772 --> 01:01:50,940
- 'Really?'
- Yeah.

740
01:01:50,941 --> 01:01:54,042
'We've had a long time to talk
since we've been down here.'

741
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:58,313
'we get it now.'

742
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:01,350
...at first, it seemed
like an accident...

743
01:02:01,351 --> 01:02:04,619
...but we know
it happened for a reason.

744
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:09,058
Go on.

745
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:10,927
'There are a lot of things
we've done in our lives'

746
01:02:10,928 --> 01:02:13,728
...that were, that were wrong.

747
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:19,701
Right, jonna?

748
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:22,804
Right.

749
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:27,809
Being down here has given us
a lot of time to think.

750
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:32,915
'And when you let us out
of here, we're gonna change'

751
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:35,717
a lot of things, we promise.

752
01:02:38,287 --> 01:02:40,655
'I'm really sorry
for everything.'

753
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:49,232
...you know, I used to be
just like you.

754
01:02:49,233 --> 01:02:51,499
I used to have everything.

755
01:02:53,803 --> 01:02:56,504
And then it can all go away
in, like, one second.

756
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:01,409
So you better appreciate
each other.

757
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:06,781
We do.

758
01:03:09,018 --> 01:03:10,520
I'm gonna hit the code now.

759
01:03:10,521 --> 01:03:13,121
And when this cover opens,
I'm not gonna be here..

760
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,359
'...and I don't wanna ever see
you two around here again.'

761
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:19,527
- 'do you get that?'
- Yeah. We understand.

762
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:24,333
Okay, we just break this whole
thing off to a lesson learned.

763
01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:26,434
That's all it was.

764
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:49,457
Open!

765
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:54,796
Fuck!

766
01:03:57,433 --> 01:03:59,667
Come on. Come on.

767
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:22,757
What's taking so long?

768
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:30,633
I got a problem.

769
01:04:30,634 --> 01:04:34,202
- What?
- 'The code's not working.'

770
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:39,008
...you said you were gonna
let us out.

771
01:04:39,009 --> 01:04:42,311
I was gonna let you out,
but he gave me the code...

772
01:04:42,312 --> 01:04:45,114
...the manager, like a month ago
in case I needed it...

773
01:04:45,115 --> 01:04:47,649
...and-and now it's not working.

774
01:04:58,594 --> 01:05:01,262
What are we supposed to do now?

775
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,201
I think you're on your own now.

776
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:11,140
Come on,
you can't leave us here.

777
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:13,209
You'll kill us.

778
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:17,246
I was gonna let you out.
I-it's not my fault.

779
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:21,616
Come on, please.

780
01:05:23,185 --> 01:05:25,922
Come on, let us out. Please!

781
01:05:25,923 --> 01:05:28,357
Call the police, do something.
They'll find us.

782
01:05:28,358 --> 01:05:30,092
No.

783
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:32,662
Then the cops know about me,
i-i-i can't.

784
01:05:32,663 --> 01:05:35,932
No, they won't. Honestly,
we-we're not gonna say anything.

785
01:05:35,933 --> 01:05:38,968
'We swear to god.
Please. Please.'

786
01:05:38,969 --> 01:05:41,203
I can't go back to jail.
I can't do it.

787
01:05:41,204 --> 01:05:42,471
I'm not calling the cops.

788
01:05:42,472 --> 01:05:44,340
It almost killed me
the first time.

789
01:05:44,341 --> 01:05:46,676
It's not too late.
Come on, let us out.

790
01:05:46,677 --> 01:05:48,177
'If you're gonna
leave us down here'

791
01:05:48,178 --> 01:05:50,379
'you're gonna fucking kill us!
Please!'

792
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:53,482
...come on! Let us out!

793
01:05:53,483 --> 01:05:58,487
God! Come on, please,
let us out.

794
01:05:58,488 --> 01:06:01,991
Come on. Come on!

795
01:06:01,992 --> 01:06:04,559
'Please! Stop!'

796
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:11,833
...she left.

797
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:15,903
She left.

798
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:19,440
She left us.

799
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:15,863
Bree?

800
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:18,833
Bree!

801
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:32,048
Bree! Bree, Bree.

802
01:07:32,049 --> 01:07:34,383
Bree, Bree, Bree, Bree.

803
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:37,653
Bree, Bree, Bree.

804
01:07:37,654 --> 01:07:41,022
God. Gosh, you scared
the crap out of me.

805
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:45,361
I don't think I can make it.

806
01:07:45,362 --> 01:07:46,761
Don't talk like that.

807
01:07:48,331 --> 01:07:49,465
It's okay. It's okay.

808
01:07:49,466 --> 01:07:52,600
Well, I lied to you.

809
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,703
What?

810
01:07:57,206 --> 01:07:59,540
I have a confession.

811
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:02,810
Tell me, please.

812
01:08:04,513 --> 01:08:06,382
Jonna, I'm so sorry.

813
01:08:06,383 --> 01:08:07,616
If I knew he was coming to you...

814
01:08:07,617 --> 01:08:10,585
I would have done
something sooner.

815
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:16,492
I saw him go in your room...

816
01:08:16,493 --> 01:08:18,593
...and I knew.

817
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:22,698
That night when the fire started...

818
01:08:22,699 --> 01:08:24,633
...it all happened so fast.

819
01:08:24,634 --> 01:08:28,104
It just caught up.
It started burning.

820
01:08:28,105 --> 01:08:31,472
He tried to get up,
but I held him down.

821
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:36,577
I held him back
until he stopped moving.

822
01:08:40,516 --> 01:08:43,684
Until I knew he wouldn't go
into your room again.

823
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:51,526
I killed the monster.

824
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,167
Come on.

825
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:05,773
Come on.

826
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:40,708
It's my turn to carry you now.

827
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,236
I need this, okay?

828
01:12:13,463 --> 01:12:15,997
God. Fuck!

829
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:13,722
No, no, no, no, no.

830
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:15,824
No. No, don't you die on me.

831
01:13:15,825 --> 01:13:18,726
No. Hey, hey.

832
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:25,534
Come on, I got the grate.
We're getting out of here.

833
01:13:25,535 --> 01:13:27,168
Come on.

834
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:29,804
Bree.

835
01:13:30,773 --> 01:13:33,240
Wake your ass up!

836
01:13:33,976 --> 01:13:37,011
Wake your ass up! Come on!

837
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:47,890
Okay, okay.
I need you to hold on.

838
01:13:47,891 --> 01:13:51,192
I need you to hold on
for me, Bree.

839
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:19,353
Fuck!

840
01:14:48,016 --> 01:14:51,753
Okay, come on. Finally.

841
01:14:51,754 --> 01:14:53,155
Come on.

842
01:14:53,156 --> 01:14:57,125
Come on, Bree. We're out.

843
01:14:57,126 --> 01:14:59,261
Come on. Okay.

844
01:14:59,262 --> 01:15:02,731
Bree. Bree, we made it.

845
01:15:02,732 --> 01:15:06,168
Come on. Hey. Hey.

846
01:15:06,169 --> 01:15:09,638
Come on. Come on, Bree,
it's fine, baby.

847
01:15:09,639 --> 01:15:13,675
Please. Please. Come on,
i need you to breathe now.

848
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:15,878
Hey, come on.

849
01:15:15,879 --> 01:15:18,647
Hey, we're so close.
Come on now, Bree. Come on.

850
01:15:18,648 --> 01:15:20,749
God.

851
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:22,985
Fuck. God.

852
01:15:22,986 --> 01:15:26,821
'Stay here.'

853
01:15:32,728 --> 01:15:34,195
'god.'

854
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:37,398
...what am I doing?

855
01:15:44,574 --> 01:15:48,075
Come on. Hey, hey, hey.

856
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:53,081
I love you, Bree.

857
01:15:53,082 --> 01:15:57,753
Come on. Breathe, baby, please.

858
01:15:57,754 --> 01:16:00,454
Come on! Come on.

859
01:16:03,091 --> 01:16:05,594
Come on, open those eyes.

860
01:16:05,595 --> 01:16:07,629
'Come on, do this.'

861
01:16:07,630 --> 01:16:09,831
...you're not gonna die.

862
01:16:09,832 --> 01:16:12,132
Come on, baby.

863
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:16,403
<i>Bree.</i>

864
01:16:22,678 --> 01:16:26,615
Come on, Bree. You can do it.

865
01:16:26,616 --> 01:16:29,516
'Come on, baby. Hey.'

866
01:16:30,652 --> 01:16:32,987
...there she is.

867
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,627
My god.

868
01:16:38,628 --> 01:16:41,495
There you go. Come on.

869
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,875
What are you doing?

870
01:16:53,876 --> 01:16:56,443
I had a feeling you were gonna
get yourselves out of there.

871
01:16:58,981 --> 01:17:01,982
You just got that fighting
spirit in you, don't you?

872
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:06,855
- Just like my little girl.
- Why?

873
01:17:06,856 --> 01:17:09,191
No. Just shut up!

874
01:17:09,192 --> 01:17:11,727
Maybe there is no reason.

875
01:17:11,728 --> 01:17:14,061
What are you gonna do?

876
01:17:16,231 --> 01:17:20,634
I shouldn't have done what
i did, but it's too late now.

877
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:25,307
I, I made it all the way
to the car...

878
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:28,877
...and I, I couldn't stop
thinking about you girls...

879
01:17:28,878 --> 01:17:32,413
...and, and what was gonna happen
if you didn't die in there.

880
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:36,517
What was gonna happen to me?

881
01:17:38,253 --> 01:17:40,656
Just listen to me, okay?

882
01:17:40,657 --> 01:17:43,325
Okay, you have lost so much.

883
01:17:43,326 --> 01:17:45,160
We all have.

884
01:17:45,161 --> 01:17:47,996
But please, please,
listen to me.

885
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:49,865
Don't let me lose
my sister, okay?

886
01:17:49,866 --> 01:17:53,268
She's, she's the only thing
i have left in this entire life.

887
01:17:53,269 --> 01:17:55,436
- Please.
- I'm sorry.

888
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:06,313
No. Don't.

889
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:45,087
Help.
We're at the katea public pool.

890
01:18:45,088 --> 01:18:48,957
My sister, she's dying.

891
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:50,758
Please hurry.

892
01:19:03,505 --> 01:19:05,240
Just go.

893
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:07,541
Get, get out of here.

894
01:19:10,879 --> 01:19:13,247
Go.

895
01:19:27,496 --> 01:19:29,931
Bree.

896
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:32,000
Bree.

897
01:19:32,001 --> 01:19:33,834
Bree.

898
01:19:41,042 --> 01:19:43,177
This is real?

899
01:19:45,046 --> 01:19:46,613
It's real.

900
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:51,386
You did it.

901
01:19:51,387 --> 01:19:53,253
We did it.

902
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:57,091
I never doubted you.

903
01:20:03,064 --> 01:20:05,365
I guess we're even.

904
01:20:07,335 --> 01:20:09,236
Not yet.

905
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:27,588
How?

906
01:20:31,259 --> 01:20:33,727
We killed the monster.
