00:01:26,963 --> 00:01:28,923
<i>Well, the weekend forecast
looking good for the area.</i>

5
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:31,926
<i>Sunny skies on tap from Brentwood
all the way north to Richmond</i>

6
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,221
<i>and throughout the state of Virginia,
with highs reaching 85 degrees.</i>

7
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:37,139
<i>Low tonight, about 65.</i>

8
00:01:37,223 --> 00:01:39,809
<i>Should be a great weekend
for hikers to get out and enjoy...</i>

9
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:56,826
Pretty girl.

10
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,452
You must be one proud papa.

11
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:04,333
Who's the Black fella?

12
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:07,712
Darius Clemmons. It's her boyfriend.

13
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:10,798
They were traveling
with a group of their friends.

14
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:14,927
Well, the Appalachian Trail's
a hefty piece of real estate.

15
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:17,221
I mean, Maine clear down to Georgia way.

16
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:19,890
I've been tracking their route,

17
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:23,352
and she promised to call
or text every week.

18
00:02:23,436 --> 00:02:25,104
And it's been six weeks.

19
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:29,567
The last place that she
texted me was here in your town.

20
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,405
Well, the fact is we get a shit-ton
of kids that come through here.

21
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:39,076
I mean, they come, and they do
whatever it is they do, and they move on.

22
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,830
My boy's down in Tampa
playing keyboard in some rockabilly band.

23
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,915
I can't remember the last time
that boy picked up a phone.

24
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,417
My daughter's not like that.

25
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,298
Well, we can make it official
if you'd like.

26
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,967
Fill out this missing persons report.

27
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:57,094
Be as detailed as you'd like.

28
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,597
But if I were to put money on it,

29
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,808
I'd say she's somewhere
sunning herself in the Keys.

30
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:07,855
Guest checkout is automatic.
I rarely see them leave.

31
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:12,401
Most are gone by sun up,
trying to catch flights or beat traffic.

32
00:03:12,485 --> 00:03:14,070
<i>And there was nothing
left in the room?</i>

33
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:16,238
<i>No. And their car was gone.</i>

34
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:17,573
<i>Okay, well,</i>

35
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:21,577
if you think of anything,
please give me a call, yeah?

36
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,245
My name's Scott.

37
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,750
You spoke to the police chief?

38
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,001
Yeah.

39
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:30,961
I didn't sense much urgency from him.

40
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:33,172
This is a quiet town.

41
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:36,258
<i>The quieter it is,
the more he gets to fish.</i>

42
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:43,057
<i>Hey, it's Jen.</i>

43
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,060
<i>Leave a message, and I'll hit you back.
Thanks, bye.</i>

44
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,271
<i>Look again. Please.</i>

45
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:50,439
<i>No, sorry, no.</i>

46
00:03:50,523 --> 00:03:52,983
You know how many tourists
come through here?

47
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:55,194
I remember drinks, not faces.

48
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,322
Lose something?

49
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,452
My daughter.

50
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:06,205
Her name is Jennifer.

51
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:09,667
She passed through here
with five of her friends.

52
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,211
They're all about the same age.

53
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,004
Yeah, I seen 'em.

54
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,674
Goddamn yuppies.

55
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,802
You didn't happen to notice
which way they went?

56
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:20,886
North, maybe.

57
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,763
Up on the AT.

58
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:28,602
But if they got lost in them woods,
you might as well just go on home,

59
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:31,105
'cause you ain't never gonna find 'em.

60
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:34,400
Yeah, well...

61
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:38,070
I don't believe that. I can't.

62
00:04:38,154 --> 00:04:41,073
Believe what you want, mister.
But know this...

63
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:44,201
Out there,

64
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:49,665
nature eats everything it catches
right down to the bone.

65
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,834
Doesn't give a shit if it's a cute girl.

66
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:00,843
Do you have kids?

67
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,763
What would you do?

68
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,809
What do you think of this one?

69
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,229
Yeah, it's-it's fine.

70
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,314
- Adam, come on.
- What? What the fuck?

71
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,316
- I need that.
- I want to show you the picture.

72
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,901
- Give me my phone.
- No!

73
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,653
Hey. Babe, you're fine.

74
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:03,113
Just breathe.

75
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:04,907
Open your mind.

76
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,200
Enjoy it, okay?

77
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:09,119
- Look at that one.
- Is that how sad I look all the time?

78
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:10,913
Yes, you do, actually.

79
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:13,040
I must really love you.

80
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:16,085
You really do.
It's-it's weird how much you love...

81
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:17,503
You're weird.

82
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:19,630
Now kiss me.

83
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,176
- Whoa!
- Ah!

84
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:32,977
You know, uh,
you're making me look bad.

85
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,938
- Sorry.
- Don't be. Fucking girl power.

86
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,566
Girl power.

87
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:41,944
Dude, where'd you
learn how to do this?

88
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,904
My dad.

89
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:45,155
He taught me two things:

90
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:48,325
How to bait a hook
and how to change a tire.

91
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,369
My dad taught me how to put in a tampon.

92
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,289
Single parent.

93
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:54,873
His eyes were closed the whole time.

94
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:56,166
Not a good experience.

95
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,876
Uh...

96
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:03,299
Oh.

97
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:04,592
- Oh, here we go.
- Sweet.

98
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:06,135
Jen, Jen, Jen.

99
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,803
My fucking hero.

100
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:13,559
It's quaint.

101
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:18,731
Yeah, especially if you miss
the good old days of the Confederacy.

102
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,198
All right.

103
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:29,825
This one's mine.

104
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,660
- That's yours, babe.
- Trying to grab yours.

105
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:32,953
Pass me mine.

106
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:44,006
- Three rooms for two nights.
- Yes.

107
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:46,925
Policies of the inn
are posted in your rooms.

108
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,761
No alcohol on the patio.

109
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:52,014
No candles in the room,
no loud music or raucous activity.

110
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,266
Hear that, boys? Behave yourselves.

111
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:01,398
Thanks. And don't worry.
I'll keep them on a short leash.

112
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:03,025
Have you been here before?

113
00:08:04,068 --> 00:08:06,528
First time.
Just doing a little hiking.

114
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:11,283
Piece of advice,
keep to the marked trail.

115
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:15,162
The land here can be unforgiving.

116
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,417
Thanks. We'll be careful.

117
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,982
You know that a bunch of abolitionists
came from this town?

118
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:47,986
Darius loves that shit.
Fucking history, baby.

119
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,614
Back when people actually fought
for what they believed in.

120
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:53,409
Listen, by the way, what was that...
what was that thing earlier?

121
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,244
Why wouldn't you hold my hand?

122
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:56,954
Nothing. No reason.

123
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,288
Oh, there's a reason.

124
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:01,417
Same reason Darius is on edge.

125
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,793
- Adam.
- Dude.

126
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,796
What? He's a Black dude
with a White girlfriend

127
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,256
in bum-fuck Virginia.

128
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,217
Hey.

129
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,892
Y'all ain't from around here, are you?

130
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,894
What gave us away?

131
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,187
Uh, yeah.

132
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:26,066
We're just, uh, checking out
the Appalachian Trail.

133
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,861
Couple days of hiking.
Nothing extreme.

134
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:30,821
There's something dangerous up there.

135
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:34,366
So if you got any questions
or you need a guide,

136
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,910
me and my pals over here,
we, uh, we know this land

137
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:39,413
like the back of our hands.

138
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,040
Thanks. Thanks. I think we're good.

139
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,209
It's your life.

140
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:47,254
But, uh, if you change your mind...

141
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,007
we'll always be around.

142
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:57,222
Driving around in a shitty pickup,
sipping moonshine, am I right?

143
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:58,515
Stop it.

144
00:09:58,599 --> 00:09:59,808
What'd you say, peckerwood?

145
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:02,019
Excuse my fiancé.

146
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:05,647
He forgets that talking to people
isn't like commenting on Reddit.

147
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,817
Don't look at me, boy.

148
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:14,782
You goddamn hipster freaks
are the problem with this whole world.

149
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:17,242
I'm betting not a goddamn one of you

150
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:20,329
ever worked a real fucking job
in your life.

151
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:24,124
So you better sit the fuck still
and behave yourself.

152
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,797
You're wrong.

153
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,381
Jen.

154
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,052
My boyfriend, Darius,
runs a sustainable energy nonprofit.

155
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,679
Milla's an oncologist.
Adam's an app developer.

156
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:40,265
And Gary and Luis own a pair
of New York bistros.

157
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:43,143
I don't know. I'd call those real jobs.

158
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:46,313
And what about you, sweetheart?

159
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,606
I have two master's.

160
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,399
Art history and dance.

161
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,360
Which means I make coffee for a living.

162
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,363
But right now I'm looking at you,

163
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:55,989
and I'm seeing some
yellowing in your eyes.

164
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:58,242
Which means what, Milla? Hmm?

165
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,411
Oh, um, it could be liver problems.

166
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:04,623
Jaundice, hepatitis, Gilbert syndrome.

167
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,334
You should probably
see a doctor, actually.

168
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,382
All right, well...

169
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:15,801
you kids be safe.

170
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:19,513
Maybe we'll see you again.

171
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,312
Seriously, do not do that ever again.

172
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:29,356
- I can't handle that.
- Dude, why do we let you drink?

173
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,691
Because usually I'm very funny.

174
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:33,193
No, actually, you have never,
ever been funny.

175
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:34,486
Like, never.

176
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,946
Where are the drinks?

177
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,742
You know this song.

178
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:42,619
Do you know this?

179
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,663
No, but it's a good song.

180
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,889
Okay, people, 8:00 a.m.

181
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:04,016
Luis, Gary, I'm talking to you.

182
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:05,767
Okay, I'm not a morning person.

183
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,853
If I don't get my eight hours,
I will be a zombie.

184
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,771
- Be a zombie who hikes.
- Hey, guys.

185
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,024
- Guys.
- What?

186
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,610
Who's that by the car?

187
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,820
Is that one of those assholes
from the bar?

188
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:18,780
Yeah, probably.

189
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:20,824
- Hey.
- Adam.

190
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,868
- Relax.
- Hey!

191
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,953
Get away from the car, man.

192
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,123
Get away from there. Shoo.

193
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,125
- He's not a dog.
- Yo!

194
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,462
Are you deaf or something?
Back the fuck off!

195
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:38,175
Jesus, Adam, are you trying
to piss off everyone in Middle America?

196
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,927
You gotta be tough with these people.

197
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,428
Okay, big guy, time for bed.

198
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:42,763
- Come on.
- Back me up here.

199
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,473
Adam.

200
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,058
Come on, forget about it.

201
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:47,768
Where the hell did that guy go?

202
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,519
Come on.

203
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,229
<i>Hi. This is Scott.</i>

204
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:53,231
<i>Leave a message and I'll get
right back to you. Thank you.</i>

205
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:56,193
<i>Hey, Dad. Sorry to call so late.</i>

206
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,195
We're still hiking the Appalachian Trail.

207
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,197
When I get back,
I promise I'll give you an answer

208
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,865
about what I plan to do.

209
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:06,203
I love you.

210
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,579
Say hi to Corinne.

211
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:09,498
Maybe she'll say hi back for a change.

212
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,376
Okay, talk soon.

213
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,170
Bye.

214
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:18,173
<i>So is Adam right?</i>

215
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,716
<i>Are you on edge?</i>

216
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,052
We can go home right now.

217
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,722
Hey, nice try,
but you don't have to protect me.

218
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:35,107
You know why I work in nonprofit
instead of on Wall Street?

219
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,820
Because...

220
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:44,908
I want to build a community
where people are valued

221
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:48,745
on their skills and their character.

222
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:55,877
Not their bank account
or their skin color.

223
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,047
Everyone works.

224
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:02,300
Everyone shares.

225
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:07,097
I'd give anything for that.

226
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,599
I know.

227
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,021
That's why I love you.

228
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,695
These are beautiful.
Did you make all this?

229
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,031
Some.

230
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,493
Hey.

231
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,162
I'm Jen. What's your name?

232
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:16,875
Don't mind Ruthie.

233
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,293
She don't like to talk.

234
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,212
I was shy too at her age.

235
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:23,131
- Is she yours?
- In a manner.

236
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:26,134
It takes a village to raise a child,
isn't that what they say?

237
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:27,969
How much?

238
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,346
Ten dollars.

239
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,980
Thanks.

240
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,110
Good morning.

241
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:45,028
I've literally never seen you wear this.

242
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,988
- Wow. Wow.
- Okay.

243
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:50,325
Yeah!

244
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,829
Walk of shame.

245
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:05,048
Hey, what's up, you guys?
Me and Gary are going on a hike.

246
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,925
I didn't know that you were filming.

247
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,344
Everyone's here.
Yeah, it's for a YouTube video.

248
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,276
Catch me.

249
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,072
Oh, my God! Help!

250
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:34,035
Oh, it's beautiful. Nature.

251
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,121
Is anyone still drunk from last night?

252
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,123
Bitch, I am.

253
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,708
That last shot was a bad idea.

254
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,335
Wait, looks like the trail ends.

255
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:45,172
Are we going this way,
or are we going this way?

256
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,132
Do you have signal on your phone?

257
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:48,717
No.

258
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,888
- I can do that.
- I've been horrible.

259
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:56,308
- Look at that.
- This is fucking awesome!

260
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,811
Whoo!

261
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,029
It's up here.

262
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,160
Okay?

263
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,194
Do you know where we're going?

264
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,153
I don't.

265
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:51,821
Do you know where we're going?

266
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,536
Okay, quick little side trip, guys.

267
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,163
- What?
- There's supposed to be

268
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:02,749
a very well-preserved
Civil War fort near here.

269
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,960
Cool. Let's find it.

270
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:07,587
Um, the woman at the inn
said we shouldn't leave the trail.

271
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,547
It's just a quick look around.

272
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:13,051
Babe, if we don't find anything,
we'll just cut back over to the trail.

273
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:16,638
You know what we wouldn't have found
if we would have stayed on the trail?

274
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,932
Hmm? The waterfall.

275
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,476
And that cliff, hmm?

276
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,062
Come on. We'll be good.

277
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,358
- Okay.
- Okay?

278
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,027
She said yes!

279
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,363
- Whoo! Whoo!
- Let's do it.

280
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,739
What does that mean?
They getting married?

281
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,241
Wait, just for the hike, right?

282
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,040
You good?

283
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,419
Such a hiker.

284
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,342
What was that?

285
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:56,136
- A snake.
- Oh, my God.

286
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:03,601
- You okay?
- Yeah.

287
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:06,563
We're good.

288
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:08,898
- Shit. Yeah, thanks.
- Fuck.

289
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,578
Ah!

290
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,542
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.

291
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,545
Dar, how much longer
is this gonna take?

292
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,506
Look, it's just a little further, okay?
I promise, okay?

293
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,674
Please.

294
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,301
- You okay?
- No!

295
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:41,264
We got to go.
We got to keep going.

296
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:43,683
We've been walking
for fucking hours.

297
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:44,642
That's what we've been doing.

298
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,478
We've been walking
way more than an hour.

299
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,646
What are you talking about?
It's been like four hours.

300
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,231
- Four hours?
- No, I mean...

301
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:52,025
I mean, since we passed that thing.

302
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,651
You know what?

303
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:57,530
Why don't you guys
just, um, just head back to the trail.

304
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:58,990
I'll meet you guys up there.

305
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,244
What is that?

306
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,045
Oh, my God! Adam!

307
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,755
- Oh, my God!
- Go, go, go, go, go.

308
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:19,302
You guys, move left!

309
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:56,381
Adam?

310
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,051
Milla. Hey.

311
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,306
You left me.

312
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:09,310
- What?
- You left me.

313
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,062
I know. I know. I'm sorry, okay?

314
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:13,106
I was freaking out.
I didn't know what I was doing.

315
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,774
- You left me!
- I know. I'm sorry.

316
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:16,901
You left me!

317
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,736
Please, don't do that again!

318
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,738
I'm so sorry, okay?

319
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:22,490
Come here.

320
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:24,742
Oh, fuck.

321
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:26,453
Jen? Jen?

322
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:30,039
Jen! Jen!

323
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:31,833
Are you okay?

324
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,254
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

325
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,881
Oh, my God, Darius! Your finger!

326
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,382
Oh, fuck!

327
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:43,094
We're okay. Oh, fuck.

328
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,597
Where's Luis and Gary?

329
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,015
Huh?

330
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:00,111
Oh, shit.

331
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,827
Luis. Luis, man. Get out of here.

332
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:09,245
Come on. Let's go over here. Come on.

333
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:10,622
No, no, no, no.

334
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:12,540
- No, no! No!
- Let's go over here.

335
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,751
Do not fucking touch me!

336
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,213
Okay.

337
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,841
No, no, no.

338
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,303
Oh, fucking shit.

339
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:28,890
We need to call for help.

340
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:30,850
I can't... I can't find my phone.

341
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:33,019
I can't find my phone. Help me find it.

342
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:35,772
Oh, fuck. No service.

343
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,649
We need to go to higher ground.

344
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,609
I'm going to climb up
and try and make a call.

345
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,070
There's no way we're going to go
back up there, okay?

346
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:44,989
- I'll find a way around.
- What fucking way around?

347
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:48,117
- Not by yourself.
- Jen... this is my fault.

348
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:50,453
It goddamn is.
It is your goddamn fault!

349
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,915
Luis! Hey! Hey!

350
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,167
It's nobody's fault, okay?
Did Darius make the tree fall?

351
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:58,419
Look at me.
Did Darius make the tree fall? No.

352
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:02,382
This is fucking awful, okay?
But it's nobody's fault, okay?

353
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:08,221
Luis, I'm sorry, man!
I'm fucking sorry, man!

354
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:11,182
I'll go by myself. I'll go right now.

355
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:12,809
We all have to go.

356
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,019
- Why?
- I can't leave him.

357
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:21,192
If it rains,
which it looks like it's about to...

358
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:25,029
we're exposed out here, guys.

359
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,783
This slope's not safe.

360
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:34,831
I think... I think someone's up there.

361
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,292
- What?
- Someone's up there.

362
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:42,297
- I don't... I don't see anyone.
- Where are they?

363
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:49,554
I saw someone. I did.
I-I saw someone.

364
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:50,972
This is so fucked up.

365
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,473
I saw someone.

366
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:54,058
It's okay.

367
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:58,438
Fuck this. Fuck this!

368
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:11,868
You okay?

369
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,167
Thanks.

370
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,377
No problem.

371
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,766
He won't be here long.

372
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,138
No one's gonna admit it.

373
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,225
So I will.

374
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,644
We're lost!

375
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,063
Just admit it, Darius.

376
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,526
- No fucking clue where we are.
- Hey. Hey. We're fine.

377
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:28,361
We're-we're cutting across the mountain,

378
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,947
and eventually,
we'll hit the AT on the other side.

379
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,491
But I think that we can probably
camp out for the night.

380
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:36,285
I'm not leaving Gary
out there in the woods overnight

381
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:39,497
for animals and insects
and whatever the fuck!

382
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,332
That's not Gary anymore.

383
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:44,210
Luis, that was his body.

384
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,337
His spirit's moved on.

385
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,298
That's what he believed, right?

386
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:53,136
He's in paradise now. He's happy.

387
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,642
Come here, man.

388
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:09,944
Okay?

389
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,530
Okay.

390
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:25,126
Can you pull this?

391
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:32,693
Oh, fuck.

392
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,657
Thank God it stopped raining.

393
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:39,784
Where's Milla?

394
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:40,743
Hmm?

395
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:44,163
I-1 didn't feel her get up.

396
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,166
She probably went somewhere to pee.

397
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:48,501
Milla?

398
00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:57,844
Jesus.

399
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:02,849
We've been sleeping in a graveyard.

400
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:05,184
Hey, guys, come check this out.

401
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:07,562
What?

402
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:09,021
Look at this.

403
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:12,900
This is a declaration pledge
to the foundation of America.

404
00:28:12,984 --> 00:28:16,195
You mean the Confederacy.

405
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:18,155
Long live slavery.

406
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:23,703
Uh, no, actually, this is...
dated before the war.

407
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:26,163
"November 24, 1859."

408
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:28,749
There's like a dozen families listed here,

409
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:32,295
pledging their lives
and their-their children's lives.

410
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:35,256
Hey, did one of you take my phone?

411
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,884
Um... no.

412
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:40,386
Maybe you dropped it yesterday
when everything was happening.

413
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:44,390
No, no, I-I put it back
in my pack last night.

414
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,313
Mine's not here either.

415
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:55,109
- Did Milla come back?
- No.

416
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:57,153
- Hey, do you have your phone?
- What?

417
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:05,411
Shit.

418
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,413
Where's our fucking phones?

419
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,040
Okay, all our phones are gone.

420
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:10,917
What the fuck is going on?

421
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,544
I thought I saw somebody
outside the tent last night.

422
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:15,087
- What?
- What?

423
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:17,173
- When?
- In the middle of the night.

424
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,841
Just for a second.

425
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:20,635
Could have just been
shadows from the trees.

426
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:22,553
Fuck!

427
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:24,555
You guys, help me... Help me find Milla.

428
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:26,599
- Adam...
- I'm sure she's fine.

429
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,143
You thought you saw someone
after the tree fell,

430
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:32,313
and then again last night,
and now our fucking phones are gone.

431
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:35,024
They're probably fucking
watching us right now!

432
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:38,486
No, no, no, no, I promised her
that I wouldn't fucking leave her again.

433
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:39,946
I fucking promised her that.

434
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:41,447
Hey, Adam! Adam!

435
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,366
Milla!

436
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:47,078
Milla!

437
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:49,330
- Milla!
- Milla!

438
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:50,957
Milla!

439
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:53,709
Milla?

440
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:55,920
- Milla!
- Milla!

441
00:29:57,338 --> 00:29:58,756
Milla!

442
00:30:00,091 --> 00:30:01,258
Milla!

443
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:02,510
Hey.

444
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:04,553
Milla!

445
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:08,516
- What are you doing out here?
- Milla!

446
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:11,811
Who's that?

447
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:14,647
I saw her in town.

448
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,357
I think her name's Ruthie.

449
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,150
In town?

450
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:19,443
Hey!

451
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:21,654
Hey. Sorry.

452
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,572
Come here.
Why don't you come here for a second.

453
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:25,074
- Adam.
- I just wanna ask you something.

454
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:28,869
No, you see this girl, and now she's here
out of fucking nowhere, and Milla's gone?

455
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:30,329
You think that this is a coincidence?

456
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:32,164
- No fucking way.
- Calm down.

457
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:34,250
I fucking warned you
about these white-trash hillbillies.

458
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,002
- Hey!
- Adam! Stop!

459
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:37,378
Get over here!

460
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:39,046
Hey! Hey!

461
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,923
- Adam!
- Hey!

462
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:42,758
Stop. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

463
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,221
Adam.

464
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:53,185
No, no, no, no, no!
Don't let her get away!

465
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:55,521
- Dar, go on after her!
- No, wait!

466
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,815
What?

467
00:30:57,898 --> 00:31:00,109
Guys? Guys, what is that?

468
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,486
My foot's caught on something.

469
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,738
What the hell is that?

470
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:05,865
Guys! Whoa!

471
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:07,366
What the hell is this?

472
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:10,036
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Darius!

473
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:12,830
- What's going on? Guys?
- Darius, help!

474
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:14,081
What? What?

475
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:20,838
Adam! Oh, my God!

476
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,300
No, no, no, no, no, no!

477
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:25,676
Adam?

478
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,261
Can you hear me?

479
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:29,180
- Adam!
- Do you see him?

480
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:30,890
No.

481
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:33,100
Uh, I-I feel a draft.

482
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:34,643
Luis, grab my legs.

483
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:36,145
Lower me in, okay?

484
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,398
Adam!

485
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:41,067
Adam...

486
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:44,779
Adam.

487
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:48,032
Oh, fuck! Shit! Shit!

488
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:52,203
Darius, this is crazy. We need help.

489
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:53,871
Look, if I can get that snake
out of there,

490
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:55,581
- maybe I can reach Adam, okay.
- And do what?

491
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,709
He's still caught on that chain.
What if he's hurt?

492
00:31:58,793 --> 00:32:01,420
Maybe this hole connects
to an old mine or something.

493
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:02,963
We can look for an entrance, and then...

494
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:06,425
Okay, how long do you want to look?
An hour? Two? All day?

495
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:07,760
That chain goes somewhere!

496
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:10,638
I know! Somebody put it there.

497
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:12,389
Do you hear what I'm saying?

498
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:15,518
We need to get the fuck
off this mountain and get help.

499
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,603
No phones. No GPS.

500
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:20,523
How are we supposed to find
our way back here, huh?

501
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,691
Jen, what the hell are you doing?

502
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:28,572
Let's go.

503
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,770
What is this place?

504
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:03,315
Looks like a lost and found
for the whole mountain.

505
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:16,537
I think maybe Adam
was right about these people.

506
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,122
We should go.

507
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:24,670
Guys, guys, shh.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

508
00:33:30,384 --> 00:33:31,927
Is that them?

509
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:34,430
- Those hunters from town?
- I don't know.

510
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:35,973
I-I can't...

511
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:39,226
That's Adam.

512
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:41,729
That's Adam.

513
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:46,942
Darius, no.

514
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,867
Hey, hey. Put him down right now.

515
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,411
Put him the fuck down!

516
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,627
Hey, hey, hey, hey. I don't understand.

517
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:08,839
Speak English.

518
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:13,093
- Oh, my God, Adam.
- Is he dead?

519
00:34:13,177 --> 00:34:14,720
Hey, where's our friend?

520
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,388
Where's our friend?
Did you take her? Did you?

521
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:18,474
Did you kill her? Answer me!

522
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:21,185
- Where is she? What'd you do?
- Did you fucking take her? Hey!

523
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:22,728
I will fucking kill you! Back up!

524
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,147
Get the fuck back!

525
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:27,483
Where is she?
What did you do with her?

526
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,026
Where is she? Where the fuck is she?

527
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,487
I can't fucking understand you.

528
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,072
Speak English! Speak English!

529
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:55,302
You killed her! You killed her!
You killed her!

530
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,431
- Adam! Adam!
- You killed her!

531
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:01,475
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Adam, Adam.

532
00:35:06,397 --> 00:35:08,274
Adam, Adam, Adam. Shit.

533
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:11,318
Shit.

534
00:35:11,402 --> 00:35:13,696
- Where's the other one?
- Oh, shit.

535
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:20,536
He's gone.

536
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:22,871
Oh, my God.

537
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:25,666
I had to.

538
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:26,917
They...

539
00:35:27,001 --> 00:35:29,295
They killed Milla. They...

540
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:31,088
They killed her.

541
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:33,799
Adam.

542
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:36,051
- Adam.
- Oh, my God.

543
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:37,886
What happened to you guys?

544
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:40,097
What the hell's going on here?
What's going...?

545
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,891
What is that?
What the fuck is going on?

546
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:44,351
Fuck.

547
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:48,564
What the fuck is that, guys?

548
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:50,357
What happened?

549
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:52,776
You're alive.

550
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,403
Yes. I'm alive. What is this?

551
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:55,946
Where have you been?

552
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:58,240
I left to go pee. I was in the woods.

553
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:01,243
I saw these two huge guys.
They were... they were dressed like this.

554
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:02,828
So I hid in the bush.

555
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:05,456
We went looking for you.
Didn't you hear us calling?

556
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:07,541
Yeah, but I couldn't answer back,
or else they'd hear me.

557
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:10,085
By the time they left, you had all gone.

558
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:12,463
- Babe, what happened to you?
- I thought you were dead.

559
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:14,131
Milla, we thought that they'd taken you,

560
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:17,551
or-or-or killed you or something.

561
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:20,429
Did you just kill this man for no reason?

562
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,473
No-no reason?

563
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:24,850
They dragged me into a fucking hole,

564
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,935
trussed me up
like a goddamn Christmas turkey.

565
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:29,063
Who knows what they were
going to do to me?

566
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:31,732
All we know for sure
is that you just killed someone.

567
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:35,444
They were going to kill me, okay?

568
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,821
Look at him. He's a...
He's a fucking animal.

569
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:39,656
He's right. Listen, listen.

570
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,992
There's one fucking dead guy
on the ground, the other one left.

571
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:43,452
We don't know how many more there are.

572
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:46,246
We have to get the fuck
off of this mountain, right?

573
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,664
What about the body?

574
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:49,750
Yeah, what about it?
I mean, we left Gary.

575
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:53,003
Yeah. When we get back to town,
we'll let the fucking police

576
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:55,422
- handle this shit.
- No, fuck that.

577
00:36:55,798 --> 00:37:00,010
No way. I-I-I am not turning myself over
to some redneck judge.

578
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:02,054
No, fuck that.
We-we-we were never here.

579
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,098
We were never here.

580
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:06,683
So we just walk away from this?

581
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:08,435
Yes.

582
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:10,687
What about the other one? He saw us.

583
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:13,065
Oh, the other one.
The really friendly-looking one

584
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,734
with the skull mask
that was... that was speaking tongues?

585
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:17,986
Yeah, I'm sure he's a regular
at city council meetings.

586
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,364
- Dude, listen. Hey, hey, listen.
- They were gonna kill me!

587
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:21,990
Listen, okay, I get it.
They didn't kill Milla.

588
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:25,786
But the-the-the snare trap
and the lumber mill, right?

589
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:28,414
- And Adam tied to a fucking log?
- Yes, yes.

590
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:30,916
I mean, who fucking knows?
They probably killed Gary.

591
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:33,961
Like, these are clearly not good people.

592
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:38,090
We got to get the fuck out of here, guys.

593
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,926
Come on, let's go. Let's go. Come on.

594
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,553
Come on.

595
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,225
<i>We're still headed east.</i>

596
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:50,811
Once we find a stream,
we can follow it down the mountain.

597
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:52,521
Why don't we just go straight down?

598
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,398
You want to take a header off a cliff?
Be my guest.

599
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,525
Okay, you don't have to be
a fucking bitch about it. I get it.

600
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,402
It's my fault. I should've
announced I was leaving to go pee.

601
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:00,571
- It's okay. Forget it.
- Fuck.

602
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:02,656
We should've grabbed some
of that climbing gear we saw.

603
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:05,242
No, it's good we didn't touch
anything, right? No traces?

604
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:07,202
If we've done nothing wrong,
we have nothing to hide.

605
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:11,206
Jesus, fucking quit it
with the morality police bullshit, Jen.

606
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,666
You're clueless about what you want

607
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:15,043
for your own blessed
all-American white girl life,

608
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:17,171
and yet you know exactly
what's right for everybody else?

609
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:18,755
- That's not what I'm saying.
- Really?

610
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,549
Do we honestly not know
what's right and wrong here?

611
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,677
What's right for you
has nothing to do with anyone else.

612
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,262
What's right should be right, period.

613
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:26,305
- Look...
- It's not for you to say.

614
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:28,265
The guy's dead. It's over.

615
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:30,642
We're not talking about it
to anybody, all right?

616
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:31,768
Whatever.

617
00:38:31,852 --> 00:38:34,104
Hey, how about we all
just shut up and relax?

618
00:38:34,188 --> 00:38:35,647
Let's see if we can make that happen.

619
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:37,316
Fuck.

620
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:39,067
Jesus Christ.

621
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:49,870
Oh, my God! Darius!

622
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:53,790
Are you okay? Are you okay?

623
00:38:53,874 --> 00:38:55,709
Another fucking trap.

624
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:59,046
Still think these people aren't monsters?

625
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:03,842
Ooh, okay. It's not that bad.

626
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:05,260
You're lucky you didn't tear an artery.

627
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:06,970
Where'd it come from?

628
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:09,515
Must've stepped on something
to trigger it.

629
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:11,225
Fuck this place.

630
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:15,812
Thanks... again.

631
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:18,774
You're welcome. Again.

632
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:21,443
Good as new.

633
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,494
Let's go.

634
00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:03,652
Luis?

635
00:40:05,529 --> 00:40:07,322
Where is he?

636
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:09,616
- Luis?
- Luis?

637
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:11,910
Oh, my God.

638
00:40:11,994 --> 00:40:14,162
- Luis?
- Luis?

639
00:40:15,372 --> 00:40:17,207
Luis?

640
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:22,129
Guys?

641
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:26,300
Oh, God, it's them.

642
00:40:27,301 --> 00:40:28,677
It's them.

643
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,470
Dude, there's nobody there.

644
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:32,556
Guys, it's them.

645
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,392
- There's nobody there, man. Relax. Relax.
- Guys?

646
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:38,437
No, it's fucking them!
We have to go right now. We have to go!

647
00:40:38,729 --> 00:40:41,023
- Adam!
- Wait, no, Milla.

648
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,696
Oh, shit.

649
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:55,370
Run. Run!

650
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:59,082
- Run, run, run.
- Adam!

651
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:01,168
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

652
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:04,630
Adam!

653
00:41:11,345 --> 00:41:12,721
Milla!

654
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:15,599
Oh, shit.

655
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:17,601
- Adam, help me.
- Milla.

656
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:18,935
Holy shit.

657
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:20,771
Milla.

658
00:41:22,606 --> 00:41:24,232
- Get me out of here.
- Oh, my God.

659
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:26,109
Uh, okay.

660
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:28,612
- Help.
- Oh, shit.

661
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:33,617
Milla.

662
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,285
Hurry.

663
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:37,454
Shit. Shit.

664
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:38,914
Fuck.

665
00:41:39,748 --> 00:41:41,708
- I'll be right back.
- No, don't.

666
00:41:41,792 --> 00:41:43,710
I'm gonna get some help.
I'll be right back.

667
00:41:43,794 --> 00:41:45,754
- No, you can't do this again!
- I'm just going to go get help.

668
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,964
- I'm going to be back, okay?
- Don't leave me! Look at me!

669
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:49,257
Fucking look at me!

670
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:52,386
- Fuck.
- No! Fuck you!

671
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:58,892
You promised me you would never leave me.

672
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:11,363
Help me.

673
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:14,199
Help me.

674
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:20,497
Help me.

675
00:42:57,743 --> 00:42:59,161
Come on, let's go.

676
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,513
What the fuck was that?

677
00:43:59,596 --> 00:44:01,056
- Ah!
- Darius!

678
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:03,350
Darius! Darius!

679
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:05,519
Darius?

680
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:28,542
Good morning.

681
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:30,752
You're late. And you're carpool today.

682
00:44:30,836 --> 00:44:31,837
- I know.
- I have class.

683
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,755
I got a meeting in Saddle River
with a roofer

684
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,006
and a concrete guy in Millburn.

685
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:36,633
- Hey.
- Hey.

686
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:38,718
- You haven't heard from Jen, have you?
- Why would she call me?

687
00:44:38,802 --> 00:44:40,595
- Because you're her mom.
- Don't say "mom."

688
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:44,558
She hates that. Get your stuff.
You have one minute.

689
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:46,184
Jenny, it's your dad.

690
00:44:46,268 --> 00:44:50,188
I'm, uh, just calling again
to see how you're doing.

691
00:44:50,272 --> 00:44:53,066
I hope you're having fun
with your friends.

692
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:55,902
<i>Listen, I'd love to talk to you
about that offer.</i>

693
00:44:55,986 --> 00:44:57,654
<i>You'd get your own office
and your own coffee maker</i>

694
00:44:57,737 --> 00:44:58,947
<i>with all the perks.</i>

695
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,824
<i>Excuse the pun.</i>

696
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:02,492
<i>Anyhow...</i>

697
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:05,579
don't forget to call me, all right?

698
00:45:05,662 --> 00:45:07,998
It's been a couple weeks now, and...

699
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:10,375
I'd love to hear your voice.

700
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,168
Please, give me a call.

701
00:45:12,252 --> 00:45:15,547
Thank you. I love you. Bye.

702
00:45:18,592 --> 00:45:19,759
Weird.

703
00:45:19,843 --> 00:45:21,052
It went to voicemail again.

704
00:45:22,512 --> 00:45:24,514
Want to know why she doesn't call?

705
00:45:24,598 --> 00:45:26,224
Jennifer went off to find herself,

706
00:45:26,308 --> 00:45:29,060
which is a choice she made
to avoid making a choice.

707
00:45:29,144 --> 00:45:33,607
Look, how about you focus
on my boys, our boys?

708
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:35,233
For once.

709
00:45:35,317 --> 00:45:36,985
- Yeah.
- Please?

710
00:46:28,495 --> 00:46:29,871
Help!

711
00:46:31,498 --> 00:46:34,000
Help! Somebody, please!

712
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:36,169
Help me!

713
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:41,299
Stop your screaming,
or you'll suffer for it.

714
00:46:41,383 --> 00:46:43,093
You. I know you.

715
00:46:43,176 --> 00:46:45,011
Help me. Please help me.

716
00:46:45,095 --> 00:46:46,888
Do you want food? Water?

717
00:46:46,972 --> 00:46:48,598
- Yes.
- Then shut your mouth.

718
00:46:48,682 --> 00:46:49,975
Understand?

719
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:51,518
Please, please, please, let me go.

720
00:46:51,601 --> 00:46:53,687
Please. You met me in town, remember?

721
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:57,190
- You and the little girl? Ruthie?
- You don't want to listen.

722
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:59,943
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
I'm sorry!

723
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:01,486
I'm sorry. Please.

724
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,446
Please, please come back.

725
00:47:04,364 --> 00:47:05,907
Please!

726
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:13,289
This isn't happening.

727
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:17,252
This isn't happening!

728
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:08,762
Milla?

729
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:21,024
Walk.

730
00:49:31,177 --> 00:49:33,138
What the...?

731
00:49:37,016 --> 00:49:38,393
Walk.

732
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:12,260
Kneel.

733
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:15,930
I'm done with this bullshit.

734
00:50:18,016 --> 00:50:19,392
Kneel.

735
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:21,269
Fuck you.

736
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:27,901
Jesus. They'll kill you, man.

737
00:50:29,152 --> 00:50:30,528
Stay down.

738
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:33,281
Stay back.

739
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:24,582
Oh, God.

740
00:51:24,666 --> 00:51:26,793
This is court.

741
00:51:26,876 --> 00:51:28,628
You are on trial.

742
00:51:29,796 --> 00:51:31,673
Trial? For what?

743
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:33,341
Murder.

744
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:36,219
This is bullshit!
We didn't murder anybody!

745
00:51:39,097 --> 00:51:40,598
Only you will speak.

746
00:51:42,225 --> 00:51:45,478
If you have questions,
my daughter will answer.

747
00:52:04,372 --> 00:52:07,834
You-you can't put us on trial.
This-this isn't a court of law.

748
00:52:07,917 --> 00:52:10,503
The law is the law.

749
00:52:10,586 --> 00:52:12,171
There's only truth and lies.

750
00:52:12,255 --> 00:52:16,759
This can't be happening.
This can't be happening.

751
00:52:16,843 --> 00:52:18,428
It's fucking insane!

752
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:24,309
The next one who speaks
out of turn loses their tongue.

753
00:52:29,731 --> 00:52:31,190
Hobbs.

754
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:39,949
I saw each of them,
in town and on the mountain.

755
00:52:43,286 --> 00:52:45,705
That one threw a bottle at me.

756
00:52:45,788 --> 00:52:48,041
- No, no.
- Jesus, Adam.

757
00:52:48,124 --> 00:52:51,586
He says vile words about us.

758
00:52:52,712 --> 00:52:54,505
He hates us.

759
00:53:07,352 --> 00:53:08,269
Morgan.

760
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:15,234
Morgan...

761
00:53:15,318 --> 00:53:17,320
tell us what you saw.

762
00:53:27,372 --> 00:53:28,873
Samuel...

763
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,837
W-w-what is he saying?

764
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:41,302
"My brother, Samuel,
and I were out hunting."

765
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:49,936
"Stalking moose and elk
for the winter larder."

766
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:58,528
"We were checking our game traps
in the cave where caught game is dragged

767
00:53:58,611 --> 00:54:00,738
to keep predators from getting to it."

768
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:03,950
- Ah!
- Adam!

769
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:10,915
"And we found
this stranger instead.”

770
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:19,465
"He was hurt, knocked out.
We were taking him down the mountain."

771
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:26,597
"Planned to leave him
where he'd be found..."

772
00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:37,692
"When these others attacked us."

773
00:54:45,992 --> 00:54:49,579
"He killed my brother Samuel."

774
00:54:49,662 --> 00:54:51,664
No. We didn't know.

775
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:54,375
They were wearing skulls,

776
00:54:54,459 --> 00:54:57,044
and their bodies were covered
with leaves and blood.

777
00:54:58,171 --> 00:55:01,257
What we wear when we go hunting, huh?

778
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:05,052
To hide our scent and our faces
from our prey.

779
00:55:05,136 --> 00:55:06,846
Your hunters do the same.

780
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:08,723
Hmm?

781
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:12,059
Did he do what Morgan has accused?

782
00:55:12,143 --> 00:55:17,064
Did this man murder
Morgan's brother, Samuel?

783
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:23,529
Lie, and dread will fall on each of you.

784
00:55:25,031 --> 00:55:26,657
I warn you.

785
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:29,243
Speak true.

786
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:37,960
No.

787
00:55:40,713 --> 00:55:42,632
He didn't murder him.

788
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:02,610
Ruthie.

789
00:56:09,784 --> 00:56:13,287
Ruthie, who killed Samuel?

790
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:20,503
You lied to this court.

791
00:56:21,671 --> 00:56:23,172
No, no.

792
00:56:23,256 --> 00:56:24,757
Adam feared for his life.

793
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,176
He killed this man in self-defense.

794
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:28,553
It's not murder.

795
00:56:28,636 --> 00:56:30,721
We thought they were kidnapping him.

796
00:56:30,805 --> 00:56:32,974
We thought they were taking him
somewhere to kill him.

797
00:56:33,057 --> 00:56:35,434
Why? Why did you think this?

798
00:56:35,518 --> 00:56:38,312
What proof did you have?

799
00:56:38,396 --> 00:56:41,190
Had you met any of our people?

800
00:56:41,941 --> 00:56:45,152
Had we caused you any harm?!

801
00:56:57,957 --> 00:57:01,460
This court finds you guilty of murder.

802
00:57:02,587 --> 00:57:04,797
- The sentence is death.
- What?

803
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,508
No, no, no, I didn't...
It was a mistake.

804
00:57:07,592 --> 00:57:09,343
I didn't know what they were doing.

805
00:57:09,427 --> 00:57:11,596
It's not my fault!

806
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:16,142
Get back.

807
00:57:16,225 --> 00:57:18,144
You want this kid to join your brother?

808
00:57:18,227 --> 00:57:20,354
Then back the fuck off!

809
00:57:20,438 --> 00:57:21,856
Adam, Adam, no.

810
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:24,483
- Shut up.
- Hey, hey, Adam.

811
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:27,737
If you hurt her, you make things
worse for all of us.

812
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:31,991
Look around, Dar.
This shit's already worse.

813
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:34,160
Okay, this is what you're gonna do.

814
00:57:34,243 --> 00:57:40,082
You're going to untie my friends,
and then you're going to let us go.

815
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:43,044
I'm not afraid of you!

816
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:46,255
I just want to get as far away
from you backwoods fucks

817
00:57:46,339 --> 00:57:47,548
as I possibly can.

818
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:49,675
Now, move.

819
00:57:49,759 --> 00:57:51,844
I look in your eyes.

820
00:57:53,304 --> 00:57:55,348
I see only fear.

821
00:57:56,641 --> 00:57:58,684
There's no future for men like you.

822
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:01,646
Fuck you!

823
00:58:04,482 --> 00:58:07,068
I was wrong to call you a man.

824
00:58:09,779 --> 00:58:13,449
The rest of you are guilty
for bearing false witness.

825
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:15,117
The sentence is darkness.

826
00:58:15,201 --> 00:58:16,994
What? No, no, no. Please, please.

827
00:58:17,078 --> 00:58:19,455
- Take them.
- Please, please, no.

828
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:21,374
Please, no! No!

829
00:58:24,377 --> 00:58:25,920
Jen! Jen!

830
00:58:29,382 --> 00:58:30,758
<i>Jen!</i>

831
00:58:56,909 --> 00:59:01,372
This family is owed retribution.

832
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:03,749
How was Samuel murdered?

833
00:59:03,833 --> 00:59:07,044
Say the words.

834
00:59:07,128 --> 00:59:10,256
How was Samuel murdered?

835
00:59:18,931 --> 00:59:20,850
He was struck in the head.

836
00:59:32,445 --> 00:59:33,738
With this.

837
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,493
No, no, no, no, no.

838
00:59:39,577 --> 00:59:40,703
No, don't do this.

839
00:59:40,786 --> 00:59:42,955
Don't do this, please.

840
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:45,458
Please. It's wrong.

841
00:59:45,541 --> 00:59:47,251
It's barbaric.

842
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:48,794
Listen to me, listen to me.

843
00:59:48,878 --> 00:59:50,796
We can help you.

844
00:59:51,672 --> 00:59:52,923
We'll do anything.

845
00:59:53,007 --> 00:59:55,134
- We can get you money...
- Barbaric?

846
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:56,719
Hmm?

847
00:59:56,886 --> 01:00:00,097
Our families built this place.

848
01:00:00,181 --> 01:00:03,225
Men and women of all races and creeds

849
01:00:03,309 --> 01:00:08,939
came here to avoid the Armageddon
they knew was coming between the States.

850
01:00:09,023 --> 01:00:11,942
We have everything we need.

851
01:00:12,026 --> 01:00:17,198
Everyone works.
Everyone contributes.

852
01:00:17,281 --> 01:00:20,075
Our food is fresh and plentiful.

853
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:24,538
We have no cancer, no poverty, no war.

854
01:00:24,622 --> 01:00:29,251
No one hates another
because they have while another doesn't.

855
01:00:29,335 --> 01:00:33,547
We are one body working together.

856
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:45,392
You tell me, whose world is more barbaric?

857
01:00:52,942 --> 01:00:54,777
No!

858
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:07,790
Take them.

859
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:25,307
Your sentence is darkness.

860
01:01:25,391 --> 01:01:29,186
Here, you will see no evil,

861
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:32,398
hear no evil, speak no evil.

862
01:01:35,776 --> 01:01:37,611
No!

863
01:01:43,492 --> 01:01:45,202
Oh, no!

864
01:01:45,286 --> 01:01:46,996
No, wait. Please, no.

865
01:01:47,079 --> 01:01:48,372
Jen!

866
01:01:48,455 --> 01:01:50,249
No! No!

867
01:01:55,296 --> 01:01:58,007
Ah! Don't!

868
01:01:58,090 --> 01:01:59,884
Darius! Darius, help me!

869
01:01:59,967 --> 01:02:01,927
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

870
01:02:02,011 --> 01:02:04,722
No! Help me! No! Please!

871
01:02:04,805 --> 01:02:05,931
Please, dear God. Please don't.

872
01:02:06,015 --> 01:02:08,017
No! No!

873
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:29,079
Fuck off.

874
01:02:36,545 --> 01:02:37,713
Listen to me.

875
01:02:37,796 --> 01:02:39,757
You're making a mistake.

876
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,176
You're wasting valuable resources...

877
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:46,764
What are we wasting?

878
01:02:46,847 --> 01:02:48,265
Us.

879
01:02:48,349 --> 01:02:49,767
Us. Us.

880
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:51,560
You-you have us.

881
01:02:51,644 --> 01:02:52,937
Use us.

882
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:54,772
Darius works in nonprofit.

883
01:02:54,855 --> 01:02:57,691
- He works in sustainable energy.
- What the hell are you doing?

884
01:02:57,775 --> 01:03:01,487
He's designed homes, neighborhoods,
communities to be self-sufficient.

885
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:03,030
We're already self-sufficient.

886
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:06,075
No, but you need maintenance,
improvements.

887
01:03:06,158 --> 01:03:08,827
You suffer storm damage, climate changes.

888
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:11,413
Springs dry up. You need problems solved.

889
01:03:11,497 --> 01:03:12,915
That's what he does.

890
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:15,876
That's his skill.

891
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,461
That's what he can contribute.

892
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:20,798
You do this, you lose all of that.

893
01:03:20,881 --> 01:03:24,051
Standard says you're strong.

894
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:25,761
You have a warrior spirit.

895
01:03:27,471 --> 01:03:28,973
I don't give up.

896
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:32,810
And what of you?

897
01:03:32,893 --> 01:03:34,979
What do you offer?

898
01:03:41,902 --> 01:03:43,278
Myself.

899
01:03:47,992 --> 01:03:50,119
There's no sickness in my family.

900
01:03:51,537 --> 01:03:53,205
No cancer.

901
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:58,419
I'm young, healthy.

902
01:04:00,045 --> 01:04:02,631
I'll have strong, healthy children.

903
01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:14,101
Who among your men needs a wife?

904
01:04:15,644 --> 01:04:17,062
No.

905
01:04:25,029 --> 01:04:26,447
Open your mouth.

906
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:33,746
Shut up.

907
01:04:36,957 --> 01:04:38,584
Spread your legs.

908
01:04:41,003 --> 01:04:42,296
Spread your legs.

909
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:44,089
Edith.

910
01:05:04,068 --> 01:05:08,238
Are you prepared to become
a loyal citizen?

911
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:11,408
Yes.

912
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:19,833
Are you prepared to become
a loyal citizen?

913
01:05:19,917 --> 01:05:21,627
Yes.

914
01:05:23,212 --> 01:05:29,301
If you run, you should know
there's no safe way off this mountain.

915
01:05:29,468 --> 01:05:33,639
If our traps don't kill you,
the animals will.

916
01:05:33,722 --> 01:05:38,018
If the land doesn't kill you,
our people will.

917
01:05:38,102 --> 01:05:43,023
If you don't contribute...
you'll end up here.

918
01:05:45,067 --> 01:05:46,568
Do you understand?

919
01:05:49,363 --> 01:05:51,240
Yes.

920
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:57,079
Yeah. Yeah.

921
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:23,647
Please don't hate me.

922
01:06:39,163 --> 01:06:40,789
<i>Vee nor.</i>

923
01:06:47,171 --> 01:06:48,881
<i>Vee nor.</i>

924
01:06:50,632 --> 01:06:52,092
<i>Vee nor.</i> What...?

925
01:06:53,093 --> 01:06:54,261
"Friends?"

926
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:55,846
Does that mean "friends?"

927
01:07:06,899 --> 01:07:08,650
Come with me.

928
01:07:57,199 --> 01:08:00,494
I've had no wife for a year.

929
01:08:07,376 --> 01:08:10,128
She died in a fall.

930
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:17,177
Here, people die
of either accidents or old age.

931
01:08:21,473 --> 01:08:23,016
Can we ever leave?

932
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:30,607
Why would you want to?

933
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:43,537
I know about life below.

934
01:08:44,663 --> 01:08:46,206
You're alone.

935
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:52,462
People come to the mountains
looking for something.

936
01:08:52,546 --> 01:08:57,968
Something to remind them
that life is worth living.

937
01:09:03,682 --> 01:09:05,767
You came looking for something.

938
01:09:11,106 --> 01:09:12,899
And now you've found it.

939
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:35,672
You're not as strong as you pretend to be.

940
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:06,953
<i>Hey, it's Jen.</i>

941
01:10:07,037 --> 01:10:08,747
<i>Leave a message, and I'll hit you back.</i>

942
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:10,499
<i>Thanks. Bye.</i>

943
01:10:10,582 --> 01:10:12,459
<i>The mailbox is full</i>

944
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:14,336
<i>and cannot accept any messages
at this time. Goodbye.</i>

945
01:10:17,297 --> 01:10:19,007
Hi.

946
01:10:19,091 --> 01:10:21,551
<i>No. I don't know.</i>

947
01:10:21,635 --> 01:10:23,220
<i>Maybe a couple more days.</i>

948
01:10:23,303 --> 01:10:26,640
<i>I'm waiting to hear back
from the local police before I move on.</i>

949
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:29,810
I know.

950
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:32,687
She's, uh... she's missing.

951
01:10:52,958 --> 01:10:54,418
Hello.

952
01:10:55,794 --> 01:10:57,838
I'm sorry about your daughter
and her friends.

953
01:10:57,921 --> 01:11:00,590
- Double whiskey.
- Thank you.

954
01:11:01,967 --> 01:11:04,511
I told her to stay on the trail.

955
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:08,890
There are people living on that mountain.

956
01:11:10,976 --> 01:11:12,894
What people?

957
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:17,858
The Foundation.

958
01:11:19,151 --> 01:11:20,861
The Foundation?

959
01:11:20,944 --> 01:11:24,364
It's a story people here know
but don't talk about,

960
01:11:24,448 --> 01:11:26,241
except in whispers.

961
01:11:26,324 --> 01:11:27,868
Like a ghost story.

962
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:29,161
Oh.

963
01:11:29,244 --> 01:11:34,749
In 1859, a dozen or so families
packed up and fled up the mountain.

964
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:39,212
They feared the collapse of America,
and wanted to protect their way of life.

965
01:11:39,671 --> 01:11:41,590
They said when America fell,

966
01:11:41,673 --> 01:11:47,179
they would be the foundation
on which a new nation would be built.

967
01:11:48,555 --> 01:11:52,350
And these descendants of these people

968
01:11:52,434 --> 01:11:56,021
are still living up there on the mountain?

969
01:11:56,104 --> 01:11:58,607
We don't bother them,
and they don't bother us.

970
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:04,321
But anyone who goes up there,
they don't come back...

971
01:12:04,404 --> 01:12:06,698
alive or dead.

972
01:12:08,742 --> 01:12:10,869
And you know this how?

973
01:12:10,952 --> 01:12:13,371
It's happened before.

974
01:12:13,455 --> 01:12:14,915
But if it's happened before,

975
01:12:14,998 --> 01:12:17,709
why hasn't someone
done something about it?

976
01:12:18,627 --> 01:12:20,086
Because...

977
01:12:20,545 --> 01:12:23,757
it's made to look like they left.

978
01:12:24,883 --> 01:12:26,676
I'm sorry.

979
01:12:55,914 --> 01:12:57,791
You just don't listen, do you, mister?

980
01:13:04,673 --> 01:13:08,510
Your girl is dead,
and you don't want to find what's left.

981
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:10,512
She's not dead.

982
01:13:12,597 --> 01:13:14,516
Oh, you son of a...

983
01:13:19,521 --> 01:13:21,815
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

984
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:24,025
Hey.

985
01:13:24,109 --> 01:13:25,610
Hey!

986
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,530
No, no, no.

987
01:13:28,613 --> 01:13:30,031
No! No!

988
01:13:30,198 --> 01:13:31,908
- Get him up.
- Hey!

989
01:13:31,992 --> 01:13:34,911
You son of a bitch.

990
01:13:59,644 --> 01:14:01,688
Oh, shit.

991
01:14:06,318 --> 01:14:08,236
What are you doing?

992
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,988
What does it look like I'm doing?

993
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:11,615
You don't want to go up there.

994
01:14:11,698 --> 01:14:14,326
She's my daughter. I'm gonna find her.

995
01:14:14,409 --> 01:14:15,285
Scott...

996
01:14:15,368 --> 01:14:17,579
And there's nothing you can do to stop me.

997
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:19,372
Jesus. What happened?

998
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:23,543
Whatever happened to you
is nothing compared to what they'll do.

999
01:14:25,295 --> 01:14:28,796
<font color=#ffcc00><small> Download Movies From - WWW.MSMOVIESBD.COM </small></font>

1000
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:30,884
I could help you.

1001
01:14:48,026 --> 01:14:49,444
This him?

1002
01:14:49,527 --> 01:14:51,071
Yes.

1003
01:14:51,154 --> 01:14:52,614
Ed, this is Mr. Shaw.

1004
01:14:53,281 --> 01:14:56,117
Ed's my nephew. He's a hunter.

1005
01:14:56,201 --> 01:14:58,036
You get in a car wreck or something?

1006
01:14:58,912 --> 01:15:00,080
Or something.

1007
01:15:00,163 --> 01:15:01,831
You got the money?

1008
01:15:04,459 --> 01:15:06,169
Five thousand.

1009
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:11,800
Okay.

1010
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:14,344
We'll see you in the morning, then.

1011
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:15,929
No, no.

1012
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:17,639
We go now.

1013
01:15:19,349 --> 01:15:20,892
You got gear?

1014
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:23,853
Can't go up there
dressed for no ladies' tea.

1015
01:15:23,937 --> 01:15:25,480
You need glasses?

1016
01:15:25,563 --> 01:15:27,941
Backpack, sleeping bag, poles.

1017
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:29,818
Okay, okay, okay. Coop.

1018
01:15:29,901 --> 01:15:32,362
Toss me my go bag.

1019
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:36,366
I got everything you need in there.

1020
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:39,077
Why don't you go and take that
yellow jacket off your back.

1021
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,287
Look like a fucking bull's-eye
walking around.

1022
01:15:41,371 --> 01:15:42,747
Give the keys to Aileen.

1023
01:15:42,831 --> 01:15:44,416
She'll park your car outside the inn,

1024
01:15:44,499 --> 01:15:46,835
make it look like
you been there all night.

1025
01:15:46,918 --> 01:15:48,878
Hey, let me ask you a question.

1026
01:15:48,962 --> 01:15:50,338
Why'd you agree to do this?

1027
01:15:50,422 --> 01:15:52,257
Money.

1028
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:55,051
Got a son here I want to send
through welding school,

1029
01:15:55,135 --> 01:15:59,222
and I ain't got no love
for them Foundation fuckers.

1030
01:16:01,349 --> 01:16:02,475
Arrow did that.

1031
01:16:02,559 --> 01:16:04,978
Nineteen stitches.

1032
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:08,648
A warning shot across the old brain pan
to keep off of their mountain.

1033
01:16:09,816 --> 01:16:11,776
Wouldn't mind returning the favor.

1034
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:29,085
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stay back.

1035
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:37,093
Stake trap.

1036
01:16:37,177 --> 01:16:39,637
Sneaky motherfuckers.

1037
01:16:39,721 --> 01:16:41,514
Get out of the creek.

1038
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:51,107
These Foundation folks
like to set traps like these

1039
01:16:51,191 --> 01:16:53,026
to drive strangers up off the mountain.

1040
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:57,614
There's a second set further up
where I got my trophy.

1041
01:16:57,697 --> 01:17:00,200
What comes after the second set?

1042
01:17:01,201 --> 01:17:02,869
Strangers don't get to leave.

1043
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:05,455
You walk where I walk.

1044
01:17:13,505 --> 01:17:14,756
Jesus.

1045
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:16,257
How much further?

1046
01:17:16,341 --> 01:17:19,052
There's a steep trail up along this ridge.

1047
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:21,971
I won't lie, though.
It's a bitch of a hike.

1048
01:17:22,055 --> 01:17:24,557
But it shortcuts us right up
to the bastards' front door.

1049
01:17:25,892 --> 01:17:28,019
Cooper! Cooper!

1050
01:17:28,102 --> 01:17:29,896
Cooper, you hurt?

1051
01:17:29,979 --> 01:17:31,564
Are you all right?

1052
01:17:31,648 --> 01:17:32,982
I think I twisted my ankle.

1053
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:35,109
Christ. Come on, help me pull him out.

1054
01:17:35,193 --> 01:17:37,153
Okay, give me your hand.

1055
01:17:42,116 --> 01:17:44,536
Give me your other hand.

1056
01:17:56,506 --> 01:17:57,882
Come on. Come on.

1057
01:17:58,842 --> 01:18:00,051
Come on.

1058
01:18:16,693 --> 01:18:18,319
What?

1059
01:18:25,994 --> 01:18:27,704
Cooper?

1060
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:34,669
Jesus.

1061
01:19:14,459 --> 01:19:16,586
One step at a time.

1062
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:34,914
Darius?

1063
01:20:34,998 --> 01:20:37,250
Uh, it's me.

1064
01:20:41,129 --> 01:20:42,630
Where's Jen?

1065
01:20:44,382 --> 01:20:46,759
What's happened to you?

1066
01:20:53,099 --> 01:20:54,684
What the fuck is happening?

1067
01:20:57,437 --> 01:20:59,022
Where's my daughter?

1068
01:21:00,273 --> 01:21:01,649
Stay back.

1069
01:21:11,117 --> 01:21:12,827
What's wrong with you people?

1070
01:21:37,685 --> 01:21:39,062
Jen?

1071
01:21:41,272 --> 01:21:42,732
Jen.

1072
01:21:44,984 --> 01:21:46,778
What have they done to you?

1073
01:21:56,871 --> 01:21:58,748
What have you done to my daughter?

1074
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:09,550
Whoever you are...
this woman is not your daughter.

1075
01:22:09,634 --> 01:22:12,345
She's my wife.

1076
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:14,263
What are you talking about?

1077
01:22:20,603 --> 01:22:22,021
What the fuck is that?

1078
01:22:22,105 --> 01:22:24,315
No trial is necessary.

1079
01:22:24,398 --> 01:22:27,318
We find this stranger guilty
of trespassing.

1080
01:22:27,401 --> 01:22:30,905
The sentence is darkness,
to be carried out at dawn.

1081
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:32,782
What are you saying?

1082
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:34,492
Hey... Ah!

1083
01:22:36,953 --> 01:22:38,704
You won't get away with this.

1084
01:22:38,788 --> 01:22:40,623
People will come for me.

1085
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:42,041
They know where I am!

1086
01:22:42,125 --> 01:22:44,585
No. No one will ever come.

1087
01:22:44,669 --> 01:22:46,379
Jennifer!

1088
01:22:55,096 --> 01:22:57,390
Are you all right?

1089
01:22:57,473 --> 01:22:59,600
I'm fine.

1090
01:22:59,684 --> 01:23:01,310
Why?

1091
01:23:01,394 --> 01:23:05,523
That man is your father.

1092
01:23:18,661 --> 01:23:20,496
I've made my choice.

1093
01:23:53,946 --> 01:23:55,698
- Jen.
- Shh.

1094
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:58,492
We don't have much time.

1095
01:23:58,576 --> 01:24:01,579
You found your way up here.
Do you know a safe way back?

1096
01:24:02,622 --> 01:24:04,457
Okay.

1097
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:06,209
Let's go.

1098
01:24:11,005 --> 01:24:12,965
You shot me with an arrow.

1099
01:24:13,049 --> 01:24:15,009
They would've killed us both.

1100
01:24:15,092 --> 01:24:16,844
Come on, let's go.

1101
01:24:37,198 --> 01:24:38,908
What is this?

1102
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:40,284
Time to leave.

1103
01:24:40,368 --> 01:24:42,119
Why now?

1104
01:24:42,203 --> 01:24:44,413
Because tomorrow morning,
they're gonna kill my dad.

1105
01:24:45,164 --> 01:24:46,332
We need to go.

1106
01:24:46,415 --> 01:24:48,125
Come on.

1107
01:24:48,209 --> 01:24:49,752
I'm not going.

1108
01:24:52,004 --> 01:24:53,839
What?

1109
01:24:53,923 --> 01:24:55,800
These people see me.

1110
01:24:55,883 --> 01:24:58,010
I belong to them.

1111
01:24:59,845 --> 01:25:01,555
They belong to me.

1112
01:25:02,765 --> 01:25:04,517
Go.

1113
01:25:05,977 --> 01:25:07,520
I won't stop you.

1114
01:25:20,366 --> 01:25:22,827
Do you really think you can
go back to your old life?

1115
01:25:38,509 --> 01:25:40,636
Stay close.

1116
01:25:47,476 --> 01:25:50,021
This gate's never locked like this.

1117
01:25:51,689 --> 01:25:53,149
Jen.

1118
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:02,074
Ruthie.

1119
01:26:02,158 --> 01:26:04,744
I have to go.

1120
01:26:04,827 --> 01:26:06,287
Do you understand?

1121
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:11,292
I know you like to sneak down
the mountain sometimes.

1122
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:13,127
Do you know another way out?

1123
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:58,005
Through there?

1124
01:26:58,089 --> 01:26:59,924
You're saying there's a way out
through there?

1125
01:27:15,106 --> 01:27:17,441
Do you want to come with me, Ruthie?

1126
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:21,695
You can if you want to.

1127
01:27:55,312 --> 01:27:56,730
Let's go.

1128
01:29:47,299 --> 01:29:48,968
Aw, geez.

1129
01:29:50,553 --> 01:29:52,471
I barely made it up here in the daylight.

1130
01:29:52,555 --> 01:29:53,764
Shh!

1131
01:29:54,932 --> 01:29:56,433
Did you hear that?

1132
01:30:19,873 --> 01:30:21,250
Jen!

1133
01:30:22,334 --> 01:30:24,003
Jen!

1134
01:30:41,395 --> 01:30:42,855
Dad.

1135
01:30:43,981 --> 01:30:45,774
Dad.

1136
01:30:50,362 --> 01:30:51,864
Jen?

1137
01:30:54,617 --> 01:30:56,118
Jen?

1138
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:15,012
I can smell your juices.

1139
01:31:24,730 --> 01:31:30,235
After Venable takes your eyes,
your ears, and your tongue,

1140
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:31,862
I'm going to keep you for myself.

1141
01:31:56,553 --> 01:31:57,680
Jen.

1142
01:32:09,066 --> 01:32:10,150
Jen?

1143
01:32:23,872 --> 01:32:25,207
Jen.

1144
01:32:27,710 --> 01:32:29,086
Jennifer.

1145
01:32:39,638 --> 01:32:41,140
All right.

1146
01:32:47,938 --> 01:32:49,690
Hey.

1147
01:33:38,739 --> 01:33:41,033
What do we do now?

1148
01:33:42,284 --> 01:33:45,287
All that matters now is the next choice.

1149
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:48,165
That's what I've learned on this mountain.

1150
01:33:50,626 --> 01:33:52,419
That's how I've survived.

1151
01:34:12,105 --> 01:34:13,482
Let's go.

1152
01:34:28,372 --> 01:34:30,082
Which way?

1153
01:34:35,879 --> 01:34:37,589
Told you I'd see you again.

1154
01:34:38,507 --> 01:34:41,260
Back the fuck up!

1155
01:34:41,343 --> 01:34:42,803
Whoa, wait a minute. We're here to help.

1156
01:34:42,886 --> 01:34:44,847
- Bullshit.
- And fuck you, too.

1157
01:34:44,930 --> 01:34:47,724
Hey, mister, I was trying
to save your life back there.

1158
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:51,228
I figured a good beat down
might send your ass packing.

1159
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:53,063
And you.

1160
01:34:53,146 --> 01:34:56,191
That yellow in my eyes...

1161
01:34:56,275 --> 01:34:58,735
was my liver turning on me.

1162
01:34:58,819 --> 01:35:00,445
You were right.

1163
01:35:01,572 --> 01:35:04,199
Look, I ain't got any kids.

1164
01:35:04,283 --> 01:35:09,454
But my nephew disappeared
in these woods six years ago.

1165
01:35:10,372 --> 01:35:12,624
And I never found the body.

1166
01:35:12,708 --> 01:35:14,751
Fucking Foundation.

1167
01:35:14,835 --> 01:35:18,380
I'd like to shoot every one
of those sons of bitches.

1168
01:35:19,965 --> 01:35:21,717
Where's your friends?

1169
01:35:22,593 --> 01:35:24,386
It's just us.

1170
01:35:24,469 --> 01:35:27,347
Well, then, let's get you
the hell off this mountain.

1171
01:35:29,975 --> 01:35:31,602
Come on.

1172
01:35:39,026 --> 01:35:40,736
Ah!

1173
01:35:45,449 --> 01:35:47,326
- Fuck!
- No, no, no!

1174
01:35:47,409 --> 01:35:50,203
- I'll get you.
- Where the fuck is it?

1175
01:36:01,924 --> 01:36:03,634
I think we got 'em.

1176
01:36:25,155 --> 01:36:26,531
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1177
01:36:30,494 --> 01:36:32,371
Jennifer!

1178
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:35,165
Get in the truck.

1179
01:36:35,248 --> 01:36:36,667
Get in.

1180
01:37:41,189 --> 01:37:44,151
It's my Great-Uncle Willie's
special recipe.

1181
01:37:47,029 --> 01:37:48,864
All right, suit yourself.

1182
01:38:25,317 --> 01:38:28,195
I want to set that footing
by tomorrow evening.

1183
01:38:28,278 --> 01:38:30,197
- Yeah. Hi, sweetie.
- Hey, Dad.

1184
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:31,907
I brought you the revised blueprints

1185
01:38:31,990 --> 01:38:33,742
- for the North Caldwell house.
- Oh, you're kidding.

1186
01:38:33,825 --> 01:38:35,702
You didn't need to bring them
all the way down here.

1187
01:38:35,786 --> 01:38:37,412
I know you wanted to see them right away.

1188
01:38:37,496 --> 01:38:40,373
I also know you're gonna hate
the new master bath.

1189
01:38:40,457 --> 01:38:42,125
Well, you did warn me.

1190
01:38:42,209 --> 01:38:43,293
Mm-hm.

1191
01:38:45,629 --> 01:38:46,838
What?

1192
01:38:46,922 --> 01:38:49,132
Nothing. I'm just proud of you.

1193
01:38:50,675 --> 01:38:51,968
Thanks, Dad.

1194
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:55,430
Come on.

1195
01:38:58,809 --> 01:39:00,435
I love you.

1196
01:39:00,519 --> 01:39:02,312
I love you, too.

1197
01:39:07,859 --> 01:39:09,569
Well, good night.

1198
01:39:09,653 --> 01:39:10,987
I'll see you at home.

1199
01:39:12,489 --> 01:39:14,282
Oh, and remember,
it's pizza and movie night,

1200
01:39:14,366 --> 01:39:15,867
so don't be late.

1201
01:39:15,951 --> 01:39:19,412
The boys picked something
with inbred cannibals?

1202
01:39:19,496 --> 01:39:20,914
Again?

1203
01:39:21,957 --> 01:39:24,417
Geez.

1204
01:39:48,024 --> 01:39:49,651
It's a privacy screen.

1205
01:39:49,734 --> 01:39:51,069
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1206
01:39:51,153 --> 01:39:52,362
You can't see it from the side.

1207
01:39:52,445 --> 01:39:54,030
All right, here we go.

1208
01:39:54,114 --> 01:39:55,490
Oh, hi, hon.

1209
01:39:55,574 --> 01:39:59,369
Uh, meet our new neighbors,
John and Ruthie.

1210
01:39:59,452 --> 01:40:02,247
They're looking at the Kaplan
house down the street.

1211
01:40:02,330 --> 01:40:03,832
Nothing is set in stone yet.

1212
01:40:03,915 --> 01:40:06,293
Well, it turns out John knows Scott.

1213
01:40:06,376 --> 01:40:08,837
Our paths crossed.

1214
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:13,341
Said if I was ever in the neighborhood
to stop by and meet the family.

1215
01:40:14,634 --> 01:40:16,136
Small world, right?

1216
01:40:17,345 --> 01:40:19,222
Yes. Very.

1217
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:24,144
Are you going to put those groceries down?

1218
01:40:26,062 --> 01:40:27,314
Corinne...

1219
01:40:27,397 --> 01:40:29,941
this coffee is wonderful, thank you.

1220
01:40:30,901 --> 01:40:33,069
Uh, can you stay for dinner?

1221
01:40:33,153 --> 01:40:35,780
I'm sure Scott would love to see you.

1222
01:40:35,864 --> 01:40:38,116
We're having pizza.

1223
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:40,035
Yes.

1224
01:40:41,536 --> 01:40:43,079
We would love to stay.

1225
01:40:43,163 --> 01:40:45,207
It's been a long drive.

1226
01:40:46,625 --> 01:40:49,544
- Thank you.
- Oh, be right back.

1227
01:40:52,005 --> 01:40:54,132
And I see you're eating for two.

1228
01:40:55,842 --> 01:40:58,303
Congratulations.

1229
01:40:58,386 --> 01:41:00,180
I need to use the bathroom.

1230
01:41:25,997 --> 01:41:28,041
- Get the fuck out of my house.
- Jen!

1231
01:41:28,124 --> 01:41:31,253
Put your weapon down,
or I kill your family.

1232
01:41:34,756 --> 01:41:36,549
I was wrong about you, Jen.

1233
01:41:38,051 --> 01:41:39,344
You are strong.

1234
01:41:39,427 --> 01:41:42,264
I had to be if I was ever
gonna get away from you.

1235
01:41:42,347 --> 01:41:44,140
Now it's time to come home.

1236
01:41:44,224 --> 01:41:46,393
What's the point? You have to kill me.

1237
01:41:46,476 --> 01:41:47,394
Yes.

1238
01:41:48,478 --> 01:41:51,147
But not until our child is born.

1239
01:41:53,692 --> 01:41:56,069
Congratulations, Grandma.

1240
01:42:23,555 --> 01:42:24,848
Jen...

1241
01:42:27,434 --> 01:42:29,644
what are you doing?

1242
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:32,230
Jen?

1243
01:42:36,443 --> 01:42:38,320
Mom?

1244
01:42:39,487 --> 01:42:41,239
Can you and the boys excuse us?

1245
01:42:41,323 --> 01:42:43,992
John's here to talk business.

1246
01:42:44,075 --> 01:42:46,703
Of course. Come on. Laundry.

1247
01:42:48,663 --> 01:42:50,790
Come on. You want pizza? Mush.

1248
01:43:04,471 --> 01:43:06,639
I was wrong about you, Jen.

1249
01:43:06,723 --> 01:43:09,142
You are strong.

1250
01:43:09,225 --> 01:43:12,687
