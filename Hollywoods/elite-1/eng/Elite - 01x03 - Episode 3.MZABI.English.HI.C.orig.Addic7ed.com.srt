Christian, do you like fish?

698
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,160
Is that a trick question?

699
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,880
We are about to order dinner,
and wanted you to join us.

700
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,680
- Besides, I think we owe you that.
- Okay.

Listen...

702
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,160
The neighbor who called the cops
told mom. So we are in trouble.

What's the matter?

704

Marina.

What's the matter with Marina?

706
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,280
She's HIV-positive, Nano.

707
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,360
And that's not the worst part.

708
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,800
The worst is I just stood there
and didn't know what to say.

709
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,760
Instead of telling her I don't care.

710
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,800
Besides, nowadays it's not a
problem. I've been reading up online,

711
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,840
and nowadays it's no big
deal to be HIV-positive.

712
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,280
Instead, I just stood there
and stared like an idiot.

- Sometimes we worry too much, right?
- Yeah.

716

That's why we decided to add some...

717

- spice to our lives.
- And that would be me, right?

718

The spice.

719
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,240
Which one am I? Pepper,
cayenne, hot chili?

720

Forgive us, really.

721
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,800

right? At least I hope so.

I'm medicated. It's undetectable.

I don't care that you didn't tell me.

736
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,200
But you kept quiet because
you were afraid I'd bolt.

It's not a problem, it's normal.

But you told Samu precisely
for that, to scare him away.
