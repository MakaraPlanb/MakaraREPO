What is the image we want to project.

858
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,720
What is it we hide from others.

859
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,920
Are we really...

860
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,800
what others believe we are, or
do they only see our best side?

861
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,200
Do you want me to tell
you what Marina was like?

862
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,400
Marina was light.

863
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,280
Marina was...

864
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,120
one of those people you
meet on a Monday and...

865
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,915
you want to look in the
face, because you know

866
00:47:02,916 --> 00:47:04,600
she will smile and brighten your day.

867
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,160
Do you have any more questions?

868
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,240
Guzmán...

869
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:21,320
Maybe there's one thing you
didn't know about your sister.

870
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,800
Look.

871
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,640
We got the...

872
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,120
autopsy results.

873
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,080
She was pregnant.

874
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,000
