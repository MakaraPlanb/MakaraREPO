2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,720
On the first of June, around 9:30 pm,

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,560
you entered the school
swimming pool. Marina was there.

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,760
You had an increasingly
heated argument...

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,640
until you picked up the trophy,

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,120
and hit her on the back
of the head with it.

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,360
She did not die instantly,
which means you left her there...

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,680
bleeding to death.

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,120
This is what we believe
happened, and more importantly,

10
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,400
what the judge believes happened.

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,400
Do you have anything
to say in your defense?

12
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,560
Nano?

13
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,120
I'm going to pick you up
from school a little early.

14
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,360
Make your escape during the party,

15
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,800
and we will do the handover at ten.

16
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,600
Hey. What's wrong? Are
you getting cold feet?

17
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,480
Tell me about Morocco.

18
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,200
About Asilah. What is it like?

19
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,960
Small.

20
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,480
A bit dirty.

21
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,480
You can only reach it by
car, taking crappy roads...

22
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,840
but it has a beautiful beach
as well, right next to the souk.

23
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,760
You will come and pick me
up from my friend's one day

24
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,520
and we'll watch the sunset
together, which is awesome.

25
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,160
I was looking at where
I can get medication,

26
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,040
and there's a clinic nearby
where they need volunteers.

27
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,600
I could help people who have
just been given their diagnosis.

28
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,760
I've been through that.

29
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,240
Okay, I'll pick you up then. But
we will watch the damn sunset.

30
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,480
Okay.

31
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,480
Sorry, Nano, I'm just a little...

32
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,080
nervous.

33
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,240
- I need one of your hugs.
- Hey...

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Tomorrow, all right?

35
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,640
All right.

36
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,880
What happened?

37
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,760
- Are you all right?
- What do you think?

38
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,360
Do you think we're all right, eh?

39
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,960
This is the second time our
home has been broken into,

40
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,600
by people looking for who knows what,

41
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,520
since you got out of the slammer.

42
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,560
What a coincidence.

43
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,920
Your brother could have been
killed. Are you listening to me?

44
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,080
Your brother could have been
killed. I could have been killed!

45
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,640
Do you even care about us?

46
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,240
- Do you even care about us?
- Mom!

47
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,320
- Why don't we have a cup of herbal tea?
- Right now, I'd prefer some whiskey.

48
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,880
Let me have a look.

49
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,560
Come on.

50
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,720
- What a mess Mom's made.
- She was shaking.

51
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,240
- You or her?
- Both of us.

52
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,400
- I'm sorry about your fucking watch.
- Don't be.

53
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,800
- It wasn't here.
- Who has it?

54
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
Ah.

55
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,200
Of course.

56
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,401
Good. The sooner you have the money,
the sooner you'll be out of here.

57
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,800
Right?

58
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,240
We're getting out of here.

59
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,880
Both of us.

60
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,040
- Tomorrow.
- Why are you telling me this?

61
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,040
I'm sick of lying to you. Of not
being able to look at you in the eyes.

62
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,400
- I swear that from now on...
- You will never lie to me again,

63
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,680
because I will never listen
to anything you say again.

64
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,800
You are no longer my brother.

65
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,240
It's just a small party to
celebrate the end of the school year.

66
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,840
Are you really not going to let
me say goodbye to my classmates?

67
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,880
I want you home as soon
as you get the grades.

68
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,040
Why won't you let her go?
She's done nothing wrong.

69
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,920
- She just wants to say goodbye.
- Mind your own business.

70
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,440
She just wants to say goodbye.

71
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,000
Omar, don't start with me.

72
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,120
I don't care. I'm tired of
having to put up with you.

73
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,640
- Tired of...
- Of what?

74
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,160
Of your father? The one
who has given you life,

75
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,321
who raised you, fed you,

76
00:04:58,322 --> 00:05:00,320
and in return you have
only brought shame on him?

77
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,400
Please, don't argue. If I'm
not allowed, then I won't go.

78
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,760
She only wants to say goodbye.

79
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,320
Fine.

80
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
So parents can go?

81
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,040
And brothers?

82
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,280
Since you're so eager
to talk, you will come.

83
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,920
That way you can
apologize to the principal.

84
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,600
- Me?
- Yes.

85
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,400
In this family, when you
are wrong, you apologize.

86
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,280
We will leave that school
with our heads high.

87
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,680
You went after my family, you son
of a bitch. That will cost you...

88
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,680
We had a deal.

89
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,840
And you broke it when you sent
your thugs to steal the watch.

90
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,760
Now it will cost you a million.

91
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,640
- You are crazy, kid.
- You're the crazy one.

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,760
The way you're going, those documents
will end up in all the papers.

93
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,560
And you won't see a penny then.

94
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,720
I'm used to being penniless. To
living in the shit. What about you?

95
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,160
How will you feel about
losing your business,

96
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,440
your house, your damn family?

97
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,560
Think about it a bit
more, kid. One million.

98
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,000
You have until seven o'clock tomorrow.

99
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,360
Morning.

100
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,520
Morning.

101
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,120
Are you coming to the party?

102
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,280
- It starts at seven.
- We have nothing to celebrate.

103
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,240
Tomorrow morning, we have an
appointment with the doctor.

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,920
Now you have nothing to say?

105
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,840
I love you very much.

106
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,280
And I hope some day you will forgive me.

107
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,640
Hello. What?

108
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,040
Are you shitting me? What do
you mean you don't have it?

109
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,800
Did they search for it?

110
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,040
Of course, they searched
everywhere for it.

111
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,840
They turned the place upside down.

112
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,360
I don't know. That guy has no
brain, he could send us all to jail,

113
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,440
whether we pay or not.

114
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,160
Do you realize what you have done?

115
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,920
No, we can't give in.

116
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,320
We have to put an end to this
or they will ruin our lives.

117
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,080
Have you really canceled
the trip to Croatia?

118
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,880
Somebody had to do it.

119
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,360
Or did you expect both our
families to travel together,

120
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,120
as if you and I were still a couple?

121
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,920
Let's leave the families out
of it until things are definite.

122
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,800
Carla? Maybe we can
still work things out.

123
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,080
In which parallel
world are you living in?

124
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
Did you hear her?

125
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,360
Polo, I'll ask you one more time.

126
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,760
Are you really going to let
that guy steal your girlfriend?

127
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,000
Don't you see how she
ignores me? She won't listen.

128
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,400
So stop talking.

129
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,000
Show her that you love her.
Take action. Do something!

130
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,760
Sure. It's so easy for you to say.

131
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,480
- How?
- Do I have to spell it out for you?

132
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,240
Guzmán... Can we talk?

133
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,240
I guess they will take advantage of
the party for Marina to sneak out.

134
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,120
With the money from
the blackmail, right?

135
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,000
So what, your brother takes your
share and you just rat him out?

136
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,800
I don't give a crap about him.

137
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,400
But, believe it or not, I
do care about your sister.

138
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,000
- I don't know. She won't listen to me.
- Nor me. But you can do something.

139
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,280
You can talk to your parents,
they can nip it in the bud.

140
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,120
I could.

141
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,760
But I won't bother.

142
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,480
What do you mean?

143
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,560
She can move to the moon, if
she wants to. I'm sick of her.

144
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,070
Sick of looking after someone

145
00:08:52,071 --> 00:08:53,920
who wants to jump off
every cliff she sees.

146
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,400
Well, let her jump, then. If she
survives, she might learn something.

147
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,800
She's your sister.

148
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,240
And she's the girl that screwed
you over. You, me, my entire family.

149
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,040
She stole from us, blackmailed
us... with the help of your brother.

150
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,360
Why don't you talk to him?

151
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,680
For the same reason I
don't talk to my sister.

152
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,923
Because you know if
something happens to them,

153
00:09:12,924 --> 00:09:14,680
they may have had it coming.

154
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,560
Hey.

155
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,280
- Do you know anything about...
- Omar?

156
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,000
They won't let me see him either.

157
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,440
What's up, guys? Last day!

158
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,040
Olé.

159
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,240
What's up with the funeral faces?

160
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,680
Come on, I'm the one with four
failed classes for September.

161
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,640
You passed all your exams, and look
like your parents were murdered.

162
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,000
Here, have a drink,
there's much to celebrate.

163
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,840
No.

164
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,440
Want some?

165
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,080
- Do you know what Nano is doing?
- Being awesome, that's what he's doing.

166
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,600
Your brother's an ace, Samu. Don't
you see he'll have a future now?

167
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,400
And you and I, a house in Morocco
on the beach for this summer.

168
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,920
What more can you ask for?

169
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,040
Cheer up, man!

170
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,040
And you, don't down the whole bottle!

171
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,320
- Let me.
- Don't you dare.

172
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,760
- Let me help you.
- Help me?

173
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,120
Do you know what you're
doing to your family and mine?

174
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,960
You should be ashamed,
betraying your people like this.

175
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,520
They will be all right, Carla.

176
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,040
If your father pays.
You have plenty of money.

177
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,480
Right, like we can trust your boyfriend.

178
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,600
How do I know he won't take
the watch to the papers?

179
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,200
He won't, I assure you.

180
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,680
Right. Like I'd believe you!

181
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,040
The watch is in good hands.

182
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,560
Do you have it?

183
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,400
Your sister has it.

184
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,080
- Did she tell you so?
- Almost. What does she think she's doing?

185
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,356
She's running away
with Samuel's brother.

186
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:04,720
They probably planned it together.

187
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,200
When is she leaving?

188
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,680
My parents are watching her, so
probably tonight during the party.

189
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,240
- I don't think she'll even stop at home.
- Why don't you ask?

190
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,600
That means she has the watch here.

191
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,840
Won't you get changed?

192
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,080
In a while.

193
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,040
I'm delaying it as much as I can.
It's the last time I'll wear this.

194
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,840
Will we see each other again?

195
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,146
If my father is making
me change schools,

196
00:11:45,147 --> 00:11:47,960
it's precisely so I don't see you again.

197
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,040
Well, hello, how's the happy couple?

198
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,760
- What are you doing here, Lu?
- I'm here to contribute some glamour.

199
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,320
Well, a lot of glamour,
to this celebration.

200
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,160
It actually looks a bit cheap.

201
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,400
But, Nadia, why are you leaving?

202
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,280
I'm not an obstacle to your
relationship, and your happy ending.

203
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,840
Really, you can stay.

204
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,080
Dear, I mean it. This
woman is very difficult.

205
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,800
- It's going to be hard for you.
- Happy?

206
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,760
Yes.

207
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,880
Who am I to get in
between the two of you?

208
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,160
In the end, there wasn't
really anything between us.

209
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,200
- Where's the catch?
- There's no catch here, Guzmán.

210
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,120
Sure, sometimes my competitive
side gets the best of me,

211
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,120

No, no punch. Thanks.

Hi.

241
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,280
Can you force a locker open?

242
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,600
Why would I know how to force a lock?

243
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,320
Okay, a guy knows everything. That's
how it is in the school of life.

244
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
Polo has some photos of me on his phone.

245
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,920
I fear he may post them online.

246
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,080
He's so resentful right
now, I think he might do it.

247
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,160
- I'll beat the crap out of him.
- No, that would be worse.

248
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,640
Could you get me his backpack?

249
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,360
It's in locker 134, please.

250
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,200

00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,000

There's nothing to talk about.

255
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,880
It's just a moment. I
want to propose a deal,

256
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,280
so that Nadia doesn't leave the school.

257
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,161
If you allow her to stay one more
year, I swear, on all things sacred,

258
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,720
I will stay away from
her. I won't even say hi.

259
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,080
- Are you tired of her?
- No.

260
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,040
No.

261
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,440
But you know, as well as I do,
that we have no future together.

262
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,800
She does, however, have a future
at this school, so, don't end it.

263
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,760
You can trust me.

264
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,360
I have many defects, many.

265
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,800
But I'm a man of my word.

266
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,880
- I have to get back.
- Damn!

267
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,564
Is this the way it will always be?

268
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,960
When will you be free of your father?

269
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,520
And you of yours?

270
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,760
How many matches will
you play this summer?

271
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,840
And how many of those do
you really want to play?

272
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,640
I only want to be with you.

273
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,120
We're screwed. My father
watches me all day long.

274
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,080
He only leaves me alone when he
goes to the bank in the afternoon.

275
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,280
Ten minutes of freedom. That's
all I can offer you this summer.

276
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,040
For one of the students
in the penultimate year,

277
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:12,440
this trophy not only means the
satisfaction of a job well done,

278
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:18,880
but also a scholarship to study
at our high school in Florida.

279
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,960
From there you can go on
to an Ivy League college.

280
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,120
And the winner is...

281
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,000
Marina Nunier.

282
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,480
Hi.

283
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,560
Thank you for the award, but I
think someone else deserves it more.

284
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,360
I don't really have much
to be proud of this year.

285
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,200
So I wanted to take this
opportunity to apologize.

286
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,720
I'm sorry for all the
damage I may have caused.

287
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,840
For letting down those I love the most.

288
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,160
And the person who's made me
feel so much in such a short time.

289
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,840
I tried to stop it all.

290
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,600
I tried...

291
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,480
to be a good daughter, a good sister.

292
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,640
I tried to live up to
your feelings, Samuel.

293
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,880
I wish we had our time machine to
go back, and start from scratch.

294
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,680
But I was myself.

295
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,280
Stubborn, unafraid of danger.

296
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,280
And...

297
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,640
always getting in trouble.

298
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,840
I'm sorry.

299
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,680
Why are you here?

300
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,200
And you?

301
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,640
I needed to think, Samuel.

302
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,320
Marina,

303
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,720
stay.

304
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,480
Please.

305
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,280
I don't want you to stay for me.
I want you to do it for yourself.

306
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,320
Did you see the way people looked at me?

307
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,200
I have nothing here, nobody.

308
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,120
They all hate me, with good reason.

309
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,280
I don't hate you.

310
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,640
Not because I don't want
to, but because I can't.

311
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,320
I'm sure, if I've forgiven
you, after what you did to me...

312
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,520
... the rest can, too.

313
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,680
I don't see how.

314
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,320
Well, it's not running
away. That is not the way.

315
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,640
Much less after
blackmailing your family.

316
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,080
And after throwing away your future
to go with a guy you don't know.

317
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,600
Please, don't do something you will
regret for the rest of your life.

318
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,920
Please.

319
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,440
No.

320
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,840
Nano forgive me, but I can't do this.

321
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,480
I can't leave, I'm sor...

322
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm on my way.

323
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,560
I'm not sure about this.

324
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,320
I don't know.

325
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,880
Where are you?

326
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,840
I'm at the swimming pool.

327
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,960
Okay, I'm on my way. Be
there in a minute, don't move.

328
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,840
- Guzmán.
- What are you doing?

329
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,320
I've talked to her and she's
leaving for good. Do something!

330
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,400
- Who?
- Marina.

331
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,160
I just talked to her and she's leaving.

332
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,520
Leave me alone.

333
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,680
- Go away. Leave me alone.
- Please!

334
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,640
Did you get the backpack?

335
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,280
- You couldn't open the locker?
- I didn't want to.

336
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,360
You don't fool me,
that is Marina's locker.

337
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,320
So what?

338
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,280
If I asked you, it's
because that matters to me.

339
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,760
- You can still...
- No, I don't want to.

340
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,360
I am not your lapdog, and I
won't do everything you ask for.

341
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,880
Does she want to fuck? We fuck.

342
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,840
Does she want a backpack
stolen? I steal it for her.

343
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,920
No.

344
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,720
- What's the matter with you?
- I am fed up, Carla.

345
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,840
I want you to see me as an equal.

346
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,760
I want to be your boyfriend, for real.

347
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,400
And I know I am poor,
and you a marchioness,

348
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,773
and our relationship is not
possible in this society,

349
00:23:53,774 --> 00:23:55,840
only in Disney movies.

350
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,160
But if we are going to
try, I want to try for real.

351
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,880
With everything to win, and lose.

352
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,280
I don't want to be your gigolo, or
your thief, or someone you can use.

353
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,800
So, laugh all you want now.

354
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,560
Can I tell you something without
you thinking I see you as a gigolo?

355
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,000
Or like someone I go
to for sex or to steal?

356
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,040
You just turned me on.

357
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,040
- Why are you here?
- The watch, Marina, please.

358
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,280
What?

359
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,160
Marina, give me the watch,
please. Can't you hear me?

360
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,720
- Give me the watch. Give me...
- No.

361
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,480
Give me the fucking watch, please!

362
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,840
Why the hell are you
sticking your nose in this?

363
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,920
- Because you stole from my girlfriend!
- She's not your girlfriend anymore!

364
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,480
What?

365
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
So...

366
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,320
you thought by getting
the watch back for her

367
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,400
she would go back to you? Shit!

368
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,160
What are you laughing at, Marina?

369
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,120
What the fuck are you laughing
about? You know what you are?

370
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,600
Huh? You know what you are? A
damn thief, that's what you are!

371
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,481
Yes! You betray your people

372
00:25:15,482 --> 00:25:18,081
for the first guy from
the hood you meet. Asshole!

373
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,880
- Yes! Get off me. Watch it.
- Know what your girlfriend is doing?

374
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,268
Falling for the first guy
from the hood she meets.

375
00:25:22,269 --> 00:25:23,840
She's using you, Polo.

376
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,760
- Marina, don't fuck with me.
- It will be worse still, you know why?

377
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,760
- She's not going back to you, Polo.
- Give me the fucking watch.

378
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,840
- She's using you, Polo.
- Is it in your pocket? Answer me.

379
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,320
- She's using you.
- Give me the watch, Marina!

380
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,720
She's using you, Polo!

381
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,280
Like they all do! Like my brother
does! You are their puppet!

382
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,040
I pity you.

383
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,400
Shit.

384
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,880
Aggghhh!

385
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,560
What the hell?

386
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,520
What happened?

387
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,280
Polo, what have you done?

388
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,680
I don't know.

389
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,840
- But I think she's not breathing.
- Who's not breathing?

390
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,600
Did anybody see you?

391
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,440
Polo, did anybody see you?

392
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,520
Good.

393
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,480
Let's get the blood off you. Come.

394
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,000
All right. Your hands.
Give me your hands.

395
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,560
Fucking shirt.

396
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,000
- Christian.
- What?

397
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,600
Do you have a shirt you can lend him?

398
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,600
- Can you explain to me...
- Get a fucking shirt!

399
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,160
Look at me!

400
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,080
Get rid of the trophy.

401
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,440
Nobody can see you
with it. Do you hear me?

402
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,120
Can you tell me who the
hell is not breathing?

403
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,520
Polo! Who the hell is
not breathing? Damn it!

404
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,960
Marina.

405
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,120
Attention, please. May
I have your attention?

406
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,320
I need you to leave the
room in an orderly fashion.

407
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,440
There's been an incident.

408
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,560
I repeat, in an orderly fashion.

409
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,880
Thank you very much.

410
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,320
- Can you calm down, please?
- How can you ask me to calm down? Fuck!

411
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,280
The police are talking to
everybody. They will ask for me too.

412
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,080
You won't say a word.

413
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:05,160
- Because you saw nothing.
- But I did! He killed Marina, damn it!

414
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,920
That would be covering up!

415
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,560
You wanted to be my boyfriend,
right? To be one of us.

416
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,600
For me to treat you like an equal.

417
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:31,680
Then you must know that, among
us, we always protect each other.

418
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,200
Like Polo did.

419
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,160
He did it for me.

420
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,320
And if you had opened that locker,
he wouldn't have had to do it.

421
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,080
You realize what you've done, right?

422
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,000
This is much more serious, damn it!

423
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,560
You want your Disney movie?

424
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,600
You've just had the break of your life.

425
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,840
Use it well.

426
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,720
- Excuse me, are you Guzmán?
- Yes.

427
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,080
- May we speak for a moment?
- Why me?

428
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,000
- Come with me, please.
- Where's my sister?

429
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,160
- Guzmán.
- Where's my sister?

430
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,520
- Calm down, Guzmán. Come with me.
- Where's my sister?

431
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,240
I said, where's my sister?

432
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,000
- Calm down, Guzmán, please. Let's talk.
- Where is my sister? Damn it!

433
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,920
Polo.

434
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,000
Did you get rid of... ?

435
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,280
Good.

436
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,095
They will realize.

437
00:33:37,096 --> 00:33:40,481
When they question me, they
will realize, I know it.

438
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,840
No, listen to me.

439
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,920
You went home because
you were very drunk.

440
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,400
Then, I texted you to come because
something serious had happened.

441
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,480
Repeat that.

442
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,400
Polo, repeat that.

443
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,280
I was very drunk and I went home.

444
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,480
My mothers had gone out for dinner.

445
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,760
Carla, my girlfriend, called and
said something terrible had happened.

446
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,920
Then, I went back to school.

447
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,360
- At what time did you leave the party?
- I don't know.

448
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,040
- Around nine, I think.
- And you went straight home?

449
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,480
Can anybody confirm
the time you got home?

450
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,440
There was nobody home.

451
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,600
Are there security cameras
in your housing complex?

452
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:42,120
Maybe we could check the footage
to confirm the time of your arrival.

453
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,480
Sorry, am I under suspicion?

454
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,600
No, these are routine checks,
nothing to worry about.

455
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,040
If the cameras confirm the time you
gave us, it will all be all right.

456
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,320
We are done.

457
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,600
Are you all right?

458
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,560
Is anything wrong?

459
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,120
Yes, yes...

460
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,160
I'm fine.

461
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,800
Listen...

462
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,160
How about, later today, we
prepare the summer schedule?

463
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,800
No hurries.

464
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,440
It will take our minds off this.

465
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,934
I don't want to go to any championships.

466
00:35:39,935 --> 00:35:42,280
I want to stay here this summer.

467
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,360
And I don't want to play tennis.

468
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,880
Losing a classmate is terrible.

469
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,840
I can't even imagine how you feel.

470
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,680
But life goes on, Ander.

471
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,800
And no matter how hard
it is, life must go on.

472
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,640
I know. And I want it to go on.

473
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,600
But I want my life to
be the one which goes on.

474
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,840
And I don't want to
play tennis again, Dad.

475
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,840
It's over.

476
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,040
Over there.

477
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,720
Thank you for coming. I love you.

478
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,560
When they check the cameras they
will know I arrived much later.

479
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,440
They will know I lied,
and they will catch me.

480
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,000
Fuck, I never should have said
I went home. That was stupid.

481
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,520
- That was stupid.
- No. You were drunk.

482
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,643
It could have taken you
longer than you thought

483
00:37:16,644 --> 00:37:18,360
to get home, or whatever.

484
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,960
We can make something up. I'm not
going to let you end up in jail.

485
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,680
It was an accident.

486
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,960
Look at me.

487
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,520
What happened was an accident.

488
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,560
- And you can't pay for that.
- I killed her, Carla.

489
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,760
It was a fit of rage, you
know me. I didn't want to.

490
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,760
- Don't talk nonsense.
- I will pay for it.

491
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,440
We must keep a cool head.

492
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,000
Why are you helping me?

493
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,000
Because you helped me,
and saved my family.

494
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,880
Listen to me. You and
I are not together.

495
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,600
What's more, let's
say we hate each other.

496
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,960
That would mean you had
no motive to kill Marina.

497
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,280
Why would you want the watch? You see?

498
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,800
It wouldn't make sense.
You'd have no motive.

499
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,640
Nobody will think it was you, okay?

500
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,040
We are not together.

501
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,896
Where's Marina?

502
00:38:34,897 --> 00:38:37,520
Why haven't they brought her body
already? I want to say goodbye.

503
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,640
- They need to perform an autopsy.
- I don't care what they have to do!

504
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,120
I want them to bring my daughter now!

505
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,240
- What is it? What are you looking at?
- Mom, that's enough.

506
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,320
Guzmán, where's Marina?

507
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,280
Where is she?

508
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,280
- Omar, I'm off to the bank. Be right back.
- All right.

509
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,920
We have ten minutes, right?

510
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,440
I'll cover for you. Until Dad gets back.

511
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,920
Come on.

512
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,680
I can't stop thinking
about that poor girl.

513
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,040
I don't know what I would
have done if it had been you.

514
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,600
Dad, I'm all right.

515
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,640
I never liked that school.

516
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,080
What does the school have to do with it?

517
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,520
- That could have happened anywhere.
- Do you still want to go?

518
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,800
Fine.

519
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,640
If you want to go back
next year, you can.

520
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,800
But I don't want to hear
about that boy again.

521
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,720
I don't want you to go near him.

522
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,640
I don't want you to
do anything but study.

523
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,840
You can go back.

524
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,440
But only on that condition.

525
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,200
No.

526
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,400
If I go back, it will
be with no conditions.

527
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,000
If I go back, it will be
as just a normal student.

528
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,120
I don't know if anything
will happen with Guzmán,

529
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,200
or with another one. Or if
nothing will happen at all.

530
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,200
But if I go back, it will
be without conditions.

531
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,080
You see? See how they've changed you?

532
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,560
Dad, maybe I haven't changed.

533
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,200
Maybe the old me wasn't me.

534
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,920
It was a girl who tried to
please her parents above all.

535
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,000
Maybe I'm different.

536
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,120
Like your sister?

537
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,240
No.

538
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,600
I don't know who I am yet.

539
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,120
But I'm going to find out.

540
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,920
I hope you and Mom can
accept that, and love me.

541
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,440
But I'm going to be myself, Dad. Myself.

542
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,360
We know who killed her.

543
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,640
On the first of June, around 9:30 pm,

544
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,000
you entered the school swimming pool.

545
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,680
Marina was there.

546
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,640
You had an increasingly
heated argument...

547
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,640
until you picked up the trophy,

548
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,920
and hit her in the back
of the head with it.

549
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,160
She did not die instantly.

550
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,800
Which means you left her
there, bleeding to death.

551
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,880
Come with me, please.

552
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,388
This is what we believe happened...

553
00:42:10,389 --> 00:42:13,160
and more importantly,

554
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,680
what the judge believes happened.

555
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,670
You would save us a lot of work

556
00:42:30,671 --> 00:42:32,720
if you told us where to
find the murder weapon,

557
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,800
the trophy.

558
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,040
Oh, right,

559
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,840
you don't have a shred
of evidence. Nothing.

560
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,520
It's him.

561
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,400
You're under arrest for
the murder of Marina Nunier.

562
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,040
- What are you saying?
- Hold him tight.

563
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,200
What the fuck are you saying?
What the fuck are you saying?

564
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,520
- Grab him.
- What the hell are you saying?

565
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,600
Look at me in the face and say it again!

566
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,840
We have a witness. Your brother.

567
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,240
A motive.

568
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,560
As her messages prove, she had
changed her mind about running away.

569
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,880
That's why you killed her.

570
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,480
Samu! You know I'd never hurt Marina.

571
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,160
- Get him!
- You know I'd never hurt Marina, Samu!

572
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,345
They killed her for that watch.

573
00:43:12,346 --> 00:43:15,200
The pen drive had a load
of dirt on her father,

574
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,880
and we wanted money for it.

575
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,300
But those people are nasty.

576
00:43:18,301 --> 00:43:20,000
They broke into my house,
assaulted my brother.

577
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,200
Come on! Look at me in the face!

578
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,800
Marina had... she had that watch.
Somebody killed her and took it.

579
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,536
One of those rich fucks. The
little marchioness, for example.

580
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,296
- She stood to lose the most.
- We don't have the watch.

581
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,160
Or any proof of blackmail.

582
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,120
You have the cell phone I
used to talk to that guy.

583
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,320
You have no proof of what you're saying.

584
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,826
Of course, I'm the one who needs proof

585
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:43,400
to accuse those rich kids.

586
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,440
Breakfast is served.

587
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,800
Darling, are you all right?

588
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,400
I'm fine.

589
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,360
Or I will be.

590
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,240
It's all over.

591
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,040
Come on, they've made pancakes,
and they are positively yummy.

592
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,520
Do you have anything
to say in your defense?

593
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,440
Yes.

594
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,920
Go to hell.

595
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,920
We can get this to go, and go home.

596
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,440
You've had enough.

597
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,160
Son of a bitch!

598
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,280
If you hadn't come to our school,
none of this would have happened.

599
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,760
- Is it my fault?
- Your murderer brother's and yours.

600
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,560
Because you introduced them, right?

601
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,440
- Live with that.
- No. You could have stopped it, and you did nothing.

602
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,256
You sat back and did nothing, so if
you're looking for a guilty party,

603
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,600
- look in the fucking mirror!
- What do you mean?

604
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:58,240
Hey, no! Enough, Guzmán!

605
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,642
For your own good,

606
00:45:13,643 --> 00:45:16,480
don't even think of returning
to our school, you hear?

607
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,080
You have been told so many
times you own the world,

608
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,440
that you even believe it, right?

609
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,400
See you in class, Lucrecia.
That's if they let you go back.

610
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,720
Guzmán!

611
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,920
What are you doing there?
Can you get down, please?

612
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,040
Samuel was right.

613
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,080
If I had talked to my parents,
or to Marina, she would be alive.

614
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,550
No...

615
00:46:08,551 --> 00:46:12,440
The only person to blame here is
the one who killed her. Nobody else.

616
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,480
My sister is dead.

617
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,880
I know, sweetie.

618
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,480
And I know it hurts a lot.

619
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,480
I know because...

620
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,320
if something happened
to you, I would die.

621
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,120
And so would your parents.

622
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,520
So please...

623
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,440
don't cause any more pain, will you?

624
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,680
And get down from there now!

625
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,840
I need to hold you.

626
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,080
Come on.

627
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,720
Guzmán! Please.

628
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,160
Come on.

629
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,434
Do something like this again,

630
00:47:17,435 --> 00:47:19,800
and I swear I'll kill
you myself, you hear me?

631
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,320
Thank you.

632
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,640
You're always there.

633
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,280
Where else would I be?

634
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,000
I need you.

635
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,560
No.

636
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,680
I need you, Lu.

637
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,560
Are you coming? We're waiting for you.

638
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,360
It's my fault.

639
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,040
They arrested my brother because of me.

640
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,400
I was so mad at him, I thought
he was capable of killing her.

641
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,560
- You are not to blame for anything.
- I accused him.

642
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:20,320
- And he's not guilty.
- I know.

643
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,200
There must be a way
to prove it wasn't him.

644
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,280
Even if we had seen the
murderer with our own eyes,

645
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,720
who would believe us, Samu?

646
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,000
- It wouldn't do any good.
- Christian, I need your help.

647
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,960
He's my brother and your best
friend. We need to do whatever we can.

648
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:40,280
There must be some evidence,
something. You have to help me.

649
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,040
Are you coming or not?
