2
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,160
What happened in town a few
days before Marina's death?

3
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,960
What do you mean?
Haven't you seen the news?

4
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,200
- Is there no police report?
- I want you to tell me.

5
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,360
Everything happened.

6
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,320
- Things were really tense.
- Too much.

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,040
When gunpowder meets fire...

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,320
... only one thing can happen.

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,080
- An explosion.
- Boom.

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,040
Everything turned to shit.

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,160
Everything.

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,680
- The burner phone, so they can't trace the call.
- Okay.

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,040
- Got the marchioness' husband's number?
- Yes.

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,280
Here it is.

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,600
His name is Teodoro Rosol.

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,600
We need to decide how much
to ask for for the watch.

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,720
A whole lot, the more the better.

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,480
That one will pay whatever
we ask to get this back.

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,240
No, we need to be clever.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,520
It has to be an amount he can
get without attracting attention.

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,960
And how much is that for a rich person?

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,280
Two hundred thousand?

23
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,880
- Five hundred thousand?
- No, he won't have that at home.

24
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,080
Much less. Besides, if he withdraws
it from a bank, they will trace it.

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,120
I'd ask for 90,000.

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,240
Yes, 90,000 is good. With
that, we can do a lot.

27
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,320
I could start afresh somewhere
else with half that money.

28
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,680
Are you sure you want to
leave? We are okay, aren't we?

29
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,680
I don't want to miss you again.

30
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,040
I'm not needed here, Samu.
You're better off without me.

31
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,360
Believe me.

32
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,360
It will be good for everybody.

33
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,680
No, they've frozen our
accounts, and we can't make bail.

34
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,480
Three hundred thousand.

35
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,640
No, no.

36
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,040
No, you wouldn't have to cover it all.

37
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,640
I see.

38
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,840
Fine. Thank you,
Federico. Have a good day.

39
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,880
Asshole.

40
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,040
My mothers can cover part of it.

41
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,371
For any more, they
would have to withdraw

42
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,336
from investment funds, which takes time.

43
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,840
Thank you. Tell them
I'll call them later.

44
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,560
What about Lu's parents?

45
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,000
They are diplomats,
and can't get involved.

46
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,840
Besides, I don't want
anything to do with her.

47
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,480
I get it.

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,640
Testing, one two, one two, testing.

49
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,920
Let's hear it.

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,520
Testing, one two, one two, testing.

51
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,920
- Good, right? Sure?
- Yes.

52
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,006
Okay.

53
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,080
Hello?

54
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,400
Yes, speaking.

55
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,120
We have something you want.

56
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,120
You don't want it to end up
in the papers, or with a judge.

57
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,480
Who are you?

58
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,240
- Do you have my watch?
- We want 90,000 euros.

59
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,640
- Tomorrow.
- Ninety thousand euros?

60
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,680
You better hand it to me tomorrow,
and expect nothing in return.

61
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,640
You don't know who you're
messing with, idiots.

62
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,640
Have the money tomorrow.

63
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,920
We'll contact you for the exchange.

64
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
How was it?

65
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,720
Fine, I think.

66
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
- He was scared.
- Good.

67
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,600
- He'll pay for sure.
- Good.

68
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,480
Who do they think they are?

69
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,280
They want to blackmail me? Me?

70
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,280
They want a measly 90,000 euros!

71
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,520
You're not paying?

72
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,000
- How could I give in to amateurs?
- Wouldn't it be better to pay?

73
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,640
It's not that much money.

74
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,440
- Do you know them, or what?
- That's ridiculous, dad!

75
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,640
I'm only saying the person who
called is a clueless nobody.

76
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,800
When they got in here to steal,
they even knew the alarm codes.

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,160
And since, lately, you
make friends with anybody...

78
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,760
- Good morning, Carla.
- Hi.

79
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,960
- Teodoro.
- Good morning, darling.

80
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,520
- I can't believe you'd say this to me...
- Everything all right?

81
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,920
Don't worry.

82
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,400
If someone's tried to pull
something on me, I know what to do.

83
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,280
So do I.

84
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,600
To begin with, they won't
get a single penny. Not one.

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,120
They should know that.

86
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,480
Were you waiting for me?

87
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,000
I've been up since seven, making
calls to get the money. It's horrible.

88
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,280
I see.

89
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,360
I'm sure someone will lend it to you.

90
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Doesn't seem like it.

91
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,601
Rats are the first to abandon ship,

92
00:05:37,602 --> 00:05:40,160
and my father's world was full of rats.

93
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,480
It's good to see you.

94
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,240
Are you going to stick
to me all day long?

95
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,040
What will your friends think
when they see you this clingy?

96
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,680
I want to make the most of these
days with you, if they are your last.

97
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,080
We have to keep you here for
the next school year, Nadia.

98
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,960
It's hopeless, Guzmán.

99
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,880
Once my father makes up
his mind, he's inflexible.

100
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,040
You should go to class.

101
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,360
- Go on.
- Fine, I'm going, bye.

102
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,680
Nadia.

103
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,760
- Can you do me a favor?
- Yes.

104
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,040
Can you give this to your brother?

105
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,080
My brother?

106
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,200
Yes. Your father took
away his cell phone.

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,280
I don't want to go near the store,
or they could see me talking to him.

108
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
Nadia.

109
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,720
- Can we talk after class?
- We have nothing to talk about.

110
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,320
Do you know you've
ruined my brother's life?

111
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,666
That's why I want to talk to
you, explain what happened.

112
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,440
I didn't have a choice.

113
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,760
There's always a choice, Marina. Always.

114
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,291
But people from your class

115
00:07:02,292 --> 00:07:04,520
never consider anything
but saving their own ass.

116
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,056
- If you'll excuse me...
- So, betraying your brother is wrong,

117
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,320
but you betraying
Martín is awesome, right?

118
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,600
Are you really making that comparison?

119
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,440
We need to talk. Come
to the bathroom with me?

120
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,080
I'm all ears.

121
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,800
Why did you get close to me
after ignoring me for years?

122
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,360
What?

123
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,280
Who stole the watches?

124
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,520
I know you are involved.

125
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,120
You were in my house,
saw me enter the code,

126
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,560
and, as girls, we used to
play with my father's watches.

127
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,280
You knew where they were.

128
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,840
Me?

129
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,840
Come on, Carla, do you
think I remember that?

130
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,200
How can you think that?

131
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,720
Well, you have a history
of making crappy friends

132
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,560
and falling under their influence.

133
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,280
You seem stupid.

134
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,680
Marina, they are blackmailing us.

135
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,280
And your family stands
to lose more than mine.

136
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,136
Your father is in pre-trial detention,

137
00:08:04,137 --> 00:08:06,560
and if these papers were to surface...

138
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,640
not even the best
lawyer will get him out.

139
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,720
Carla, I know nothing about it, really.

140
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,360
My father will not pay.

141
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,600
You think he's going to let some idiots

142
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:16,960
take his money and get away with it?

143
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,720
No.

144
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,480
He's going to find them, and
it will be bad for everybody.

145
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,040
Mostly for you.

146
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,200
So tell them to keep the watches,
but to return the red one.

147
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,680
And to do it now.

148
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,560
Fucking Nano!

149
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,560
Nano, we agreed you would
forget about the blackmail.

150
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,400
- You've put me in a difficult situation!
- Marina, don't worry about a thing.

151
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,520
How can I not worry?

152
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,040
That watch contains
sensitive information.

153
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,960
If it reaches the press,
it will ruin my family.

154
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,240
I won't let you do it.

155
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,200
That information won't
reach anybody, trust me.

156
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,440
That guy will pay. We need
that money to go away together.

157
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,360
I haven't said I'm leaving with you.

158
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,560
Carla.

159
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,880
Here.

160
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,840
- What's this?
- Do you like it?

161
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,560
A bit obvious, don't you think?

162
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,280
Your way of telling me you
can buy me these things,

163
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,360
but Christian not.

164
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,400
It's just a present, I
don't mean to buy you.

165
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,480
You can't buy me.

166
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,640
I don't have a price, and if
I did, you couldn't afford it.

167
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,200
Are you going to let that
loser ruin everything we have?

168
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,960
You ruined it. Not him.

169
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,200
And I'm the one in front of
you, asking you to forgive me.

170
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
I don't...

171
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,760
I can't live without you.

172
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,840
- Don't you see I can't?
- Yes, you can.

173
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,520
You know why?

174
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,040
Because, I think you
like boys more than girls.

175
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,760
And it's no big deal. That's fine.

176
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,160
You just need to accept it
yourself. I'm working on it.

177
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,280
So what if I also like guys?

178
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,040
What we have is stronger than
all that. We're Carla and Polo.

179
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,640
We go together.

180
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,400
That can't be broken.

181
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,000
It's already broken.

182
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,480
Would you like a photo?

183
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,560
It's your moment of triumph. I'd
like to give you my best angle.

184
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,480
You are top of the class, the
prize is for you. As if I cared.

185
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,880
Lu, I'm also leaving the school.

186
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,480
My father doesn't want me
to do my next year here.

187
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,760
So we won the top idiot
prize by competing, right?

188
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,160
I never wanted to compete.

189
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,640
Nadia, please!

190
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,080
From day one, I recognized you as
my equal. Even if you won't admit it.

191
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:27,320
For you and me, nothing is ever
enough. We always want more.

192
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,960
Did you really think that prize
would change anything in my life?

193
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,520
No.

194
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,440
And still... I needed it.

195
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,720
Too bad another hypocrite will get it.

196
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,480
Marina?

197
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,480
She's the best after the two of us.

198
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,240
She screwed us over really well.

199
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,280
Turned out to be smarter
than everybody else.

200
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,320
But I'll tell you one thing.

201
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,480
I won't leave without a fight.

202
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,200
Or without winning.

203
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,920
So what happened between you and Polo?

204
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,080
I left him.

205
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,456
We wanted to keep our
relationship alive by any means,

206
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,480
- but dead things don't come back to life.
- Damn, I'm sorry.

207
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,640
But then you have no
boyfriend. You are alone, free.

208
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,240
Yes, alone, free, with no close
friends, and a thousand problems.

209
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,800
I did not expect this
going into the summer.

210
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,600
- But then you and I could...
- We could what, Christian?

211
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,160
We could date!

212
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,320
- We have great sex, right?
- Yes.

213
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,760
I don't know if I'd want to date
someone who sells himself for a cover.

214
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,400
I don't sell myself, okay?

215
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,638
I make a living,

216
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,560
which is what those of us who
were not born millionaires do!

217
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,800
- It's very easy to judge us from up there.
- All right, Christian!

218
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,840
Christian, wait!

219
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,040
Fine, you're right. I'm
not in your situation.

220
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,720
Don't you think that's precisely
why we cannot be together?

221
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,960
Honestly, no. Stranger
things have happened.

222
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,880
You could give me a chance.

223
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,760
The only thing I need
right now is a friend.

224
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,680
Think you can be that?

225
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,800
Yes.

226
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,160
Omar.

227
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,000
Remember Fatima and Nasser?

228
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,560
- Of course.
- She used to look after you.

229
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,680
- How are you, Omar? You're all grown up.
- How are you?

230
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,720
A very good son. Very responsible.

231
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,200
Follows the Koran.

232
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,800
And very hard-working.

233
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,160
He has a daughter, about your age.

234
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,000
- You know her, right?
- Yes.

235
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,880
Why don't you come for tea on
Wednesday and bring her along?

236
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,320
I don't know if I can on Wednesday.

237
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,160
Do you have anything better to
do than meet your future wife?

238
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,720
Bye, then.

239
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,160
And don't rush him.

240
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,400
We don't want him looking that
scared when we introduce them.

241
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,576
- See you soon.
- Bye, my friend.

242
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,280
I get it, my father is a leper
and you won't help him. Very well.

243
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,745
Never mind, when he returns to work

244
00:13:56,746 --> 00:13:59,120
I'll remind him who was there, asshole!

245
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,240
- Everything all right?
- What are you doing here, Lu?

246
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,720
I go to school for my
things, and don't see you.

247
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,480
I call and text you,
and you don't answer.

248
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,600
I'm beginning to feel
a bit ignored, actually.

249
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,616
You don't see me for three
days, and I'm already forgotten?

250
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,000
Sorry, I don't know why,
but all I can think of

251
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,640
is getting money to bail my father out.

252
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,760
I see.

253
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,462
And you can't answer one of my messages

254
00:14:26,463 --> 00:14:28,760
while you're holding your phone.

255
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,600
Lu, right now the last thing I need
is your passive-aggressive drama.

256
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,680
And what do you need? Money.

257
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,520
How much?

258
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,760
Three hundred thousand.
Got them in your bag?

259
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,480
Why are you being such a jerk?

260
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,920
I only wanted to help.

261
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,760
Oh, you came to help me, sorry!

262
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,200
I thought it was because
I didn't answer your calls.

263
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,480
If you are not well, lean on me.

264
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,760
Don't insult me.

265
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,920
And don't push me aside.

266
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,080
We've always supported each other
through the good and the bad.

267
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,800
"We," Lu?

268
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,440
How do I say this, so you
get it once and for all?

269
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,600
There isn't a "we" anymore.

270
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,880
That's nonsense.

271
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,040
I'm in love with Nadia.

272
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,560
You're not in your right
mind because of your father.

273
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,600
You don't know what you're saying.

274
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,480
Did you see what happened at the
store? Now they want to marry me off.

275
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,560
It's a nightmare.

276
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,640
Omar, she's a good girl.

277
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,360
Really, Nadia? You too?

278
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,760
Are you serious?

279
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,320
There are arranged
marriages that turn out fine.

280
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,480
Before marrying her or any
other, I'd slit my wrists.

281
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,720
- No. Don't even joke about that.
- Get it?

282
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,280
Nadia, I don't want to be introduced
to that girl. Help me, please.

283
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,160
Dad is very upset.

284
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,440
But it will blow over.

285
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,240
All you have to do is go
along with him for a while.

286
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,320
For how long?

287
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,600
Until my wedding day? Or my child's
wedding day? No, I can't, Nadia.

288
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,000
Nadia, I can't breathe anymore.

289
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,840
Help me, please.

290
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,720
Ander gave me this, for you.

291
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,600
You really like him, huh?

292
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,440
But I'll never be able to be with him.

293
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,080
Go to him. I'll cover for you.

294
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,800
You mean it?

295
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,560
Thank you.

296
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,680
We can't accept this.

297
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
What we have to do is
ask for twice as much.

298
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,604
If they know Marina has
something to do with this,

299
00:17:50,605 --> 00:17:52,680
they'll get to us in no time.

300
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,840
And what are they going
to do? Call the police?

301
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,320
Hire thugs?

302
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,120
No, they will come for us themselves.

303
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,280
They will budge. They act
tough, but they will budge.

304
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,880
We have to think through our next move.

305
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,800
Hey.

306
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,360
You came.

307
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,840
- Shall we go inside?
- Okay.

308
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Sure your parents aren't here?

309
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,680
Okay, I can see they are not.

310
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,880
So, shall we fuck?

311
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,640
Or we could talk.

312
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,400
While we fuck.

313
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,520
Are you going to let your
father arrange a wedding for you?

314
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,120
It's absurd.

315
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,200
Do you really want to talk
about that? What a downer.

316
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,040
You won't let him do it, right?

317
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,000
When did you figure out you liked men?

318
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,320
You're changing the subject.

319
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,640
Do you know what two gay guys
ask each other when they meet?

320
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,520
That's the first one.

321
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,960
"When you found out you liked guys."

322
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,240
The second one is
whether your parents know.

323
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,480
I want this moment to be ours.

324
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,840
And not to think that somebody out
there is arranging a wedding for me.

325
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
Okay.

326
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,440
But they are arranging it.

327
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,480
Do your parents know?

328
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,280
You know what?

329
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,160
I love you.

330
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,120
You are so lucky. I never
have the house to myself.

331
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,040
I have it to myself every day until ten.

332
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,960
- See you.
- Bye.

333
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,640
What's going on?

334
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,200
Answer it.

335
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,760
- Wait, let me talk.
- No, I'll talk.

336
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,720
- Fine, put it on speakerphone.
- Okay.

337
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,400
- Hello.
- How do we go about the handover?

338
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,800
When are you giving me the watch?

339
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,040
We want double now.

340
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,760
What?

341
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,760
One hundred and eighty thousand.

342
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,520
Who do you think you are?

343
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,480
Nobody will pay that much.

344
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,040
Nobody.

345
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,320
You've just dug your own grave.

346
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,080
He hung up, but he'll pay for sure.

347
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,840
Next time let me do the talking.

348
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,680
If there is a next time, fuck.

349
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,280
- We know you're...
- ... gay.

350
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,520
- Gay.
- Gay.

351
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,680
And it's not a problem.

352
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,840
Did you look at my computer?

353
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,360
There was no need.

354
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,000
Son, it's all right.

355
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,640
If, at his age, I'd told
my father I was a faggot...

356
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,520
- Antonio.
- ... he would have hit me.

357
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,190
Fine. What I want to say

358
00:23:25,191 --> 00:23:27,440
is that you shouldn't
let that ruin your future.

359
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,960
Tennis is not like soccer.

360
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,600
It's not a paradise of tolerance,

361
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,320
but you can make history as the
first gay man to win the French Open.

362
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,520
Think about it.

363
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,290
I'm sure there's plenty of sponsors

364
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:41,880
who'd be happy to work with a boy...

365
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,480
like you.

366
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,680
Okay.

367
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,960
So I can fuck guys as
long as I am a champion.

368
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,600
You can listen to music later.

369
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,880
It breaks my heart to see you like this.

370
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,800
What's his name?

371
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,160
His name is Omar.

372
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,915
But we can't be together

373
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:16,800
because his father is
from the fucking stone age.

374
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,960
Omar, is that Arabic?

375
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,880
- You disapprove?
- Who, me?

376
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,880
What kind of person do you think I am?

377
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,320
What you think of us is alarming!

378
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,760
You could talk to his father.

379
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,280
Me? I don't know him.

380
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,040
He's Nadia's brother.

381
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,320
Omar?

382
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,760
That Omar?

383
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,440
The one who sells drugs?

384
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,480
- Are you in love with a dealer?
- He's not a dealer, Mom!

385
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,440
He used to deal because he needs
money to get out of that house.

386
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,160
Help us, please.

387
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,400
He's not lucky enough
to have parents like you.

388
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,240
Talk to his father.

389
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,240
And what would I tell him?

390
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,520
I can't, Ander.

391
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,640
Only you...

392
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,080
So many guys out there,
and you fall for a dealer.

393
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,080
A dealer who's Muslim, and gay.

394
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,240
Mom.

395
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,360
I heard you want Omar to
meet Fatima's daughter.

396
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,040
Zahira.

397
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,480
Yes, a very good girl.

398
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,760
She is, right?

399
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,440
You know her, don't you?

400
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,200
Nadia, do you have
anything to say about her?

401
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:04,200
- No. I won't speak ill of Zahira.
- What about Fatima's daughter?

402
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:11,200
I think we all want Omar
to marry the right person.

403
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,560
If you have something
to say, say it clearly.

404
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,800
In this town, we all know each other.

405
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,560
Why don't you ask around?

406
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
There's no need.

407
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,680
I'll call them and cancel tea myself.

408
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,840
Our son cannot marry just anybody.

409
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,920
Besides, why the rush?

410
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,240
Thank you.

411
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,360
I'm also doing it for her. She
doesn't deserve an unhappy marriage.

412
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,560
- May I come in?
- Of course, Guzmán.

413
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,240
What is it?

414
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,360
I wanted to talk to you about Nadia.

415
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,897
Did you know she's not coming
back here next school year?

416
00:27:21,898 --> 00:27:23,840
Her father forbids it.

417
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,240
Oh.

418
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,840
- No, I didn't know.
- We can't let that happen.

419
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,520
Education is no longer
compulsory at your age.

420
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,560
If the father wants to remove
her from school, he can do it.

421
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,000
Why should she pay for
her father's intolerance?

422
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,280
She did not choose to be
born into a family like that.

423
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,400
Nadia wants to be here.

424
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,480
She's a very good student, she has
a scholarship. We can't let her go.

425
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,760
You started to date Marina and
you found out she was pregnant.

426
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,360
- Didn't that bother you?
- No.

427
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,360
Of course not.

428
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,600
It was hard at first,
but I did not resent it.

429
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,560
Samuel, are you telling
me the whole truth?

430
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,040
Samuel, all of this is a
bit absurd, to be honest.

431
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,800
You don't need to sit at the other
end when we are in the same room.

432
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,640
You very well know I
did not want to hurt you.

433
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,000
I need someone to lean on right now,

434
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,760
- to tell everything that crosses my mind.
- That's not going to be me.

435
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,400
Can you give us a
moment? We need to talk.

436
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,360
Remember when I told you the
blackmailers were nobodies?

437
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,640
That they had asked
for very little money?

438
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,920
- Today they asked for twice that amount.
- What do you mean by that?

439
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,800
Marina, that proves you talked to them.

440
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,120
I don't give a rat's ass how you do
it, but you need to get that watch.

441
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,960
Fall in love with whoever you want.

442
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,480
Play at being the rebel, the misfit.

443
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,120
I don't care.

444
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,760
But don't risk everything you
have and endanger your family.

445
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,880
- Thank you for coming again.
- This is becoming a habit.

446
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,480
- What happened now?
- Nothing bad, I assure you.

447
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,920
It's about your daughter.

448
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,640
I heard you don't want her
to come here next school year.

449
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,240
We are delighted with her.

450
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,600
She's got an excellent record
here. She has adapted wonderfully.

451
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,720
- It's a thoughtfully considered decision.
- I'm not saying it isn't.

452
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,040
But if there was a way
to change your mind...

453
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,760
we think you are taking a
wonderful opportunity from her.

454
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,800
Are you saying I'm a bad father?
That, as an uneducated Muslim,

455
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,800
- I don't know what's best for her?
- No, no, no.

456
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,960
I'm just trying to make
you see that Nadia...

457
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,480
would get many advantages, were
she to remain at this school.

458
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,200
- She has learned a lot so far.
- Yes.

459
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,511
She has learned to
disrespect her parents.

460
00:30:20,512 --> 00:30:23,000
To lie, to sneak out of her house.

461
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,600
- To neglect her religious duties.
- Normal for a teenager.

462
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,040
They all rebel at that age.

463
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,120
Hey.

464
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,840
What are you doing? We have an exam.

465
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,960
Is that what you teach here?

466
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,560
To be permissive of rebelliousness?

467
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,200
Don't turn the paper until I tell you.

468
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,730
Don't worry, there's nothing there

469
00:30:45,731 --> 00:30:47,840
we haven't gone over a thousand times.

470
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,760
Excuse me.

471
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,160
What are you doing here,
Lucrecia? You are suspended.

472
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,320
I know, but I have the
right to take this exam.

473
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,880
I'll sit over there.

474
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,760
Nadia, we're leaving.

475
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,000
- What?
- I'm taking you out of here immediately.

476
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,920
- Let's go.
- Excuse me. Yusef, let's talk.

477
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,120
Don't take it like that. I
never meant to offend you.

478
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,560
Don't make her pay for it.

479
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,680
Nadia, let's go. Don't
make me repeat myself.

480
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,400
Dad, we are about to start an exam.

481
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,480
Let's go!

482
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,840
- Don't treat her like that!
- Shut up!

483
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,640
- Don't grab her like that!
- Dad! Dad!

484
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,400
I feel for her! For
her and for your son.

485
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,240
To be a woman or a homosexual in
your family must be hell! Poor Omar!

486
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,920
Dad.

487
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,040
- Hey!
- What?

488
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,720
What are you insinuating about my son?

489
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,840
Go back to class.

490
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,680
Let's go.

491
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,840
You too.

492
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,320
Come on.

493
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,520
Carry on with your
exam. Nothing happened.

494
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,880
What are you doing here?

495
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,816
She says she has a
right to take the exam.

496
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,200
Out! Right now.

497
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,080
What are you laughing at, idiot?

498
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,360
If you think you'll get
Carla, you are mistaken.

499
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,960
As a hobby you were fine, but...
you're too small-fry for her.

500
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,520
Right.

501
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,160
But I wasn't too
small-fry for you, right?

502
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,560
What did you like best about me? My ass.

503
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,320
Or my dick?

504
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,520
Because you held on to it well.

505
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,600
Asking for a beating, are you?!

506
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,760
You'll never be her
boyfriend, you hear me? Never!

507
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,800
Maybe. But that is more likely to
happen than you fucking me again.

508
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,040
I didn't force you, remember?

509
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,600
You allowed yourself to be bought.

510
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,680
You're no better than me.

511
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,560
What are you looking at?

512
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,882
- What's wrong?
- Your fucking ex!

513
00:33:25,885 --> 00:33:27,080
He sure knows how to push my buttons!

514
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,560
Calm down. Look at me, okay? Calm down.

515
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,160
Ignore him. Just ignore him.

516
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,080
Okay?

517
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,360
We could do something fun today.
Introduce me to your friends.

518
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,240
You know my world, but
I don't know yours. Okay?

519
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,800
You!

520
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,840
Tell me why you are being slandered!

521
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,920
What have you done for
them to think you like men?

522
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Dad!

523
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,280
Tell me it's not true! Tell me!

524
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,640
Dad...

525
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,480
Tell me my son is not a homosexual.

526
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,640
No, I don't know who
told you that, but no.

527
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,040
I'm not.

528
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,600
It's all right.

529
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,320
Tomorrow we'll meet
Fatima and her daughter.

530
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,360
And if she's not the right
wife for you, then another.

531
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,120
But we'll find one soon.

532
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,000
I'm not going to let anybody
tarnish your good name.

533
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,680
Or this family's.

534
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,360
I am a coward.

535
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,120
No.

536
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,720
You did what you had to do.

537
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,520
What happened? Why does he know?

538
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,360
- The school principal told him.
- What?

539
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,920
Isn't that Ander's
mother? What is she doing?

540
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,400
She just ruined my life.

541
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,760
Yours and mine. Dad
dragged me out of class.

542
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,440
In front of everybody. So humiliating.

543
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,320
- Hello, Pilar.
- Hi, cutie.

544
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,880
- Is Samuel here?
- No, he's at work.

545
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,720
Do you mind if I wait for him here?

546
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,800
- Sure, come in.
- I don't want to go home.

547
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,720
Because of what's
going on with my father.

548
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,040
Some story, that one.

549
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,120
I know.

550
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,440
- I don't think he'll be long.
- It's okay, I'll wait here.

551
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,000
You caught me with my cards.

552
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,720
Hey, do you want me
to read them for you?

553
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,360
Maybe we find out when
your father gets out.

554
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,960
- No.
- This is never wrong.

555
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,280
- Could I use your bathroom?
- Of course, you know where it is.

556
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,360
Thank you.

557
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,920
Shit.

558
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,760
Looking for this?

559
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,720
Yes, but not to give it to them.

560
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,000
I wanted to keep it, and
keep it from the papers.

561
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,560
I told you I would not
give it to the papers.

562
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,560
But here.

563
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,680
I do trust you.

564
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,480
I only ask one thing.

565
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,640
Let them pay us.

566
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,200
That money is loose change to them.
A bargain, after what they did.

567
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,320
And when they pay us, you do
what you want with the watch.

568
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,440
Sure?

569
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,720
Marina...

570
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,880
we are having a child together.

571
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,640
If I don't trust you,
who am I going to trust?

572
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,960
I haven't made up my
mind to keep it yet.

573
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,280
Do you know how many calls I
had to make to get that money?

574
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,680
Do you know what it cost me? But
that didn't matter to those losers.

575
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,960
Because for them we are
only fucking posh people.

576
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,960
You didn't think the town would be
upset? To see your father go free?

577
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,320
What? The law is the same for everybody.

578
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,520
If a judge sets bail, and you
can pay it, that's not illegal.

579
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,920
You didn't know you were
walking into a hornet's nest?

580
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,400
Marina.

581
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,720
- Look who's here.
- Dad.

582
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,960
They released you.

583
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,435
Thanks to your brother,

584
00:38:13,436 --> 00:38:16,120
who did not stop until he
raised the money to pay bail.

585
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,520
He's shown me a lot.

586
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,280
- Marina, we need to talk.
- About what, Dad?

587
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,560
Teo tells me you are involved
in the theft of the watches.

588
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,600
Who are your friends, child?

589
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,520
- They have brainwashed you.
- Marina.

590
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,440
Do you know how serious this is?

591
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,360
All that's at stake?

592
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,200
- Dad, why do you think I'm involved?
- Carla told us everything.

593
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,680
And it wouldn't be the first time
you hung out with riffraff like that.

594
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,080
Riffraff, Guzmán?

595
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,360
Dad went to jail, but
they are the riffraff?

596
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,520
- What are you saying?
- Don't go there, please.

597
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,600
So you do have something
to do with those losers.

598
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,360
- Marina, you just don't learn.
- What losers are you talking about?

599
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,160
I'm tired of your arrogance, and yours!

600
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,720
So they caught you
red-handed? Deal with it!

601
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,240
Everybody calm down.

602
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,680
- Sure, ask us to calm down now.
- How can I calm down with this nut job,

603
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,160
- who prefers those losers to her family!
- You know what, Guzmán?

604
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,800
With those people you call
losers, I'm making my own family.

605
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,080
More authentic and less hypocritical.

606
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,280
What do you mean?

607
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,160
I'm pregnant.

608
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,760
Marina.

609
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,840
Please, say that's not true.

610
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,280
Who's the father?

611
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,600
That waiter?

612
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,960
No. His brother.

613
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,760
That's why you helped
him with the theft, huh?

614
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,040
That's it. I'll fix this right now!

615
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,480
Where are you going?

616
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,200
Ander, call Polo, you have to help me.

617
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,560
Now!

618
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,760
Marina, please. Think
about what you're saying.

619
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,640
Don't do things out of
spite for your parents.

620
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,680
You can't have a child now.
Much less, with a boy like that!

621
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,200
- Even you should realize that!
- Do you think I can reason with you?

622
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,480
Look at yourself! You're so prejudiced!

623
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,560
Just thinking your girl

624
00:40:14,561 --> 00:40:17,480
may not date a future
minister makes you freak out!

625
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,440
- That boy is blackmailing us!
- You are underage,

626
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,320
and you will do as we say.

627
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,360
That's it. And you will not go
ahead with that pregnancy, you hear?

628
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,950
Wait and see. But don't worry,

629
00:40:28,951 --> 00:40:30,200
this child will not
meet its grandparents.

630
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,760
Nano,

631
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,560
listen, we can leave together
whenever you want, okay?

632
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,960
Guzmán, this is crazy.

633
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,400
Wait, stop. Stop, damn it!

634
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,800
What? Damn it, Ander!

635
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,040
Must I remind you of what happened
last time you tried to fix things?

636
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,320
- They got fixed.
- You almost killed Pablo.

637
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,360
We go to these people's house,
take what's ours, and leave.

638
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,600
- Or are you getting cold feet?
- They are not at home.

639
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,920
Carla's just posted this.

640
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,480
I swear she's all right.

641
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,360
Carla's here for a reason.

642
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,158
Why would she ask so many questions?

643
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:27,536
She doesn't trust me or my brother.

644
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:31,160
No, man, she likes me, for
real. She's mad about me.

645
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,600
Son of a bitch! You may fool
your brother, but not me.

646
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,040
First you steal from me. And
then get my sister pregnant.

647
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,000
You are an asshole!

648
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,560
Ah! Fuck!

649
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,240
- I won't let that bastard end up with you!
- Go to hell!

650
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,520
Son of a bitch!

651
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,520
Ander! Let's go!

652
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,000
- Come back here!
- Son of a bitch!

653
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,360
Please, open.

654
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,920
- Please, I'm being chased!
- Go away!

655
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,760
Nadia. Nadia.

656
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,120
That boy isn't your problem.
Let him fend for himself!

657
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,720
Say what you want, he's coming in.

658
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,800
They are after me!

659
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,400
Call the police!

660
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,920
Why the police?

661
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,560
Son of a bitch!

662
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,000
See why I didn't want you to
befriend him? He's trouble!

663
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,800
Ander!

664
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,360
Ander!

665
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,280
I love you.

666
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,120
I love you, damn it!

667
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,360
Asshole, they had to
kill me for you to say it.

668
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,600
Oh, what's wrong?

669
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,640
Samuel?

670
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,760
Samuel, what's going on?

671
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,720
Aggh!

672
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,280
Samuel.

673
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,320
Samuel, what did you do?

674
