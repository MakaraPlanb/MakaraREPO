00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,479
That's the first time
you didn't call it a fetus.

898
00:38:30,509 --> 00:38:33,349
Just an expression.

I told you.

[ Chuckles ]
Yes, you did.

903
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,830
You're gonna need to stay in bed
for the next four months...

904
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:54,373
but both you and your son's
prognosis is excellent.

905
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,400
Hey.

906
00:38:56,435 --> 00:38:58,735
We wanted it
to be a surprise.

907
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,870
Oops.

908
00:39:00,906 --> 00:39:03,936
Rookie mistake.

Yes!

911
00:39:07,813 --> 00:39:10,483
We are definitely
celebrating tonight.

912
00:39:10,516 --> 00:39:12,616
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Screw sleep, Murphy.

913
00:39:12,651 --> 00:39:14,391
You are coming with us.

914
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,750
Where are you going?
Out.

915
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:17,587
We're gonna drink.
I'm not thirsty.

916
00:39:17,623 --> 00:39:19,093
Don't be an idiot.
Hey.

917
00:39:19,124 --> 00:39:20,764
I just meant...

918
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:22,392
Come on, mate.

919
00:39:22,428 --> 00:39:25,398
You just saved
an 18-year-old girl's sex life.

920
00:39:25,431 --> 00:39:26,671
And I saved two lives.

921
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,068
We are drinking.

922
00:39:30,736 --> 00:39:31,836
Come on, Shaun.

00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:36,409
Okay.

00:39:36,442 --> 00:39:38,512
Cool.

All right.

930
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:55,929
I have to go home now.

931
00:39:55,961 --> 00:39:57,731
It'll be okay.
Don't worry.

to keep me guessing *

Hi, Shaun.

936
00:40:28,527 --> 00:40:30,597
Hi, Colleen.

937
00:40:30,629 --> 00:40:33,629
I heard Steve showed you
my dad's magazine.

938
00:40:33,665 --> 00:40:35,165
Did you like it?

939
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:40,443
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

940
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:45,084
It's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

941
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:48,610
All guys like
that kind of stuff.

942
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:52,617
You want to know
a secret about me?

I think
you're really cute.

944

You smell like bubble gum.

945
00:40:57,255 --> 00:40:59,555
I know.
It's my lip gloss.

Come on.
I'm curious.

what it feels like.

Oh, my God. I can't believe
you were about to pull it out.
