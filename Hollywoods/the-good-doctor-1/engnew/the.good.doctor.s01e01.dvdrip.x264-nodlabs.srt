1
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:51,223
Mister. Mister?

2
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,837
Ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:30,023
welcome to San Jose
International Airport.

4
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:58,815
Watch out!

5
00:03:02,028 --> 00:03:03,439
- Adam! - Adam!

6
00:03:03,463 --> 00:03:04,487
Oh, my God!

7
00:03:05,031 --> 00:03:07,796
Adam! Somebody call 911!

8
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,128
Oh, my God.

9
00:03:12,072 --> 00:03:14,564
I'm a doctor. Let me take
a look. Let me take a look.

10
00:03:15,742 --> 00:03:18,654
His jugular vein's been cut.
Does anyone have a clean cloth?

11
00:03:18,678 --> 00:03:21,157
- Please, someone.
- I have a fresh change of clothes

12
00:03:21,181 --> 00:03:22,376
-in my bag. -That's great.

13
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:33,317
You're killing him.

14
00:03:34,494 --> 00:03:36,394
I'm saving his life.
He was bleeding out.

15
00:03:36,563 --> 00:03:38,140
You have it in the wrong place.

16
00:03:38,164 --> 00:03:40,076
I think I remember
enough of Anatomy 101

17
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,590
to know where
the jugular vein is.

18
00:03:41,735 --> 00:03:43,846
You would be in the right
place if he were an adult.

19
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,681
He's not an adult. He is a boy,

20
00:03:45,705 --> 00:03:48,150
which means you're also
putting pressure on his trachea,

21
00:03:48,174 --> 00:03:50,074
which means he's
not currently breathing.

22
00:03:52,412 --> 00:03:54,779
You have to put the
pressure higher up.

23
00:03:58,919 --> 00:03:59,943
There.

24
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,544
Oh.

25
00:04:11,197 --> 00:04:13,131
There's some
glass. He'll be fine.

26
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:15,359
Who are you?

27
00:04:16,102 --> 00:04:18,180
Hello. I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

28
00:04:18,204 --> 00:04:21,367
I'm a surgical resident at San
Jose Saint Bonaventure Hospital.

29
00:04:31,651 --> 00:04:36,632
Autism, a mental condition
characterized by difficulty

30
00:04:36,656 --> 00:04:40,422
in communicating and using
language and abstract concepts.

31
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,891
That's the definition.

32
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:44,495
Does it sound like I'm
describing a surgeon?

33
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:46,095
He's not Rain Man.

34
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,812
He's high-functioning. He's
capable of living on his own,

35
00:04:49,836 --> 00:04:51,804
capable of managing
his own affairs.

36
00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:55,565
"High-functioning"? Is that
our new hiring standard?

37
00:04:55,976 --> 00:04:57,620
If it were, you
wouldn't be here.

38
00:04:57,644 --> 00:05:00,409
I'm sorry. Is this really
necessary? Really?

39
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,414
A special meeting of the board of
directors, as much as I love you all,

40
00:05:04,951 --> 00:05:08,097
questioning one of my hiring
decisions? Did you bother to look up

41
00:05:08,121 --> 00:05:11,000
the definition of "president" while
you were skimming the dictionary?

42
00:05:11,024 --> 00:05:14,837
You're hiring him to be a
surgical resident, my department,

43
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:16,329
over my objections.

44
00:05:17,197 --> 00:05:19,108
Marcus, stop making
everything so personal.

45
00:05:19,132 --> 00:05:20,443
I made it personal?

46
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:23,579
You've wanted his job since day
one. Everyone in this room knows that.

47
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:25,514
And, Aaron, yes,
this is your hospital,

48
00:05:25,538 --> 00:05:28,851
but the money it takes to run it
comes from the foundation I control,

49
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,519
so let's all play
nice, shall we?

50
00:05:30,543 --> 00:05:33,422
Stop acting like you're stunned
that you're standing there.

51
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:34,880
You tried to slip one past us.

52
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:37,793
I vetted him like I would
any other candidate.

53
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:38,928
And you genuinely thought

54
00:05:38,952 --> 00:05:41,364
that his board wouldn't
reasonably have any doubts

55
00:05:41,388 --> 00:05:44,221
about hiring a surgeon who's
been diagnosed with autism?

56
00:05:45,825 --> 00:05:47,384
So justify your decision.

57
00:05:50,397 --> 00:05:53,492
I met Shaun Murphy
when he was 14 years old.

58
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,680
I was living in Wyoming at
the time. He was, and he still is,

59
00:05:57,704 --> 00:05:59,849
an extraordinary young man.

60
00:05:59,873 --> 00:06:03,639
Yes, he has autism, but he
also has savant syndrome,

61
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:08,391
genius-level skills in several
areas. He has almost perfect recall.

62
00:06:08,415 --> 00:06:13,562
He has spatial intelligence, and
he sees things and analyzes things

63
00:06:13,586 --> 00:06:15,865
in ways that are
just remarkable,

64
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:19,135
in ways that we can't
even begin to understand.

65
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:20,236
Those are assets.

66
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,991
Undeniable assets
for any doctor,

67
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:24,728
particularly a surgeon.

68
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:29,261
I mean, you've known
him since he was 14.

69
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,214
You care about him.
He's like a son to you.

70
00:06:32,238 --> 00:06:35,484
Dr. Andrews, your wife is
gonna be very upset with you.

71
00:06:35,508 --> 00:06:37,353
If you're trying to turn
this into a nepotism case,

72
00:06:37,377 --> 00:06:40,176
we're gonna have to fire her
idiot nephew from bookkeeping.

73
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,030
Hey.

74
00:06:48,054 --> 00:06:49,432
Sorry. You seen Claire?

75
00:06:49,456 --> 00:06:50,733
Would you turn off the light?

76
00:06:50,757 --> 00:06:52,001
Sure. You seen Claire?

77
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:54,036
Why? Would you
turn off the light?

78
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,604
Melendez wants
to operate on 104,

79
00:06:55,628 --> 00:06:57,873
but Claire hasn't
gotten informed consent.

80
00:06:57,897 --> 00:07:00,127
And she's ignoring her
page. You seen her?

81
00:07:00,266 --> 00:07:02,344
No. Now go away,
and turn off the light.

82
00:07:02,368 --> 00:07:03,392
Sure.

83
00:07:11,544 --> 00:07:13,444
They need you to...

84
00:07:13,747 --> 00:07:15,044
I heard.

85
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,040
She's such a bitch.

86
00:07:20,286 --> 00:07:24,052
No. She just doesn't like you.

87
00:07:28,094 --> 00:07:29,653
It's kind of silly, isn't it?

88
00:07:29,963 --> 00:07:33,609
Um, maybe. To say for sure,

89
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:35,978
I'd need to know what
it is you're talking about.

90
00:07:36,002 --> 00:07:37,113
Us.

91
00:07:37,137 --> 00:07:40,266
Well, not silly at all.

92
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,251
Quite a bit of fun, actually.

93
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:45,643
I meant that we're
hiding it, our relationship.

94
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:46,989
Hmm.

95
00:07:47,013 --> 00:07:50,244
Well, Jared,

96
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:55,248
we don't have a
relationship. We have sex.

97
00:07:55,855 --> 00:08:00,588
But, if you wanna tell people
that you're screwing me, go for it.

98
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:30,499
The veins in the boy's
left arm are popping.

99
00:08:30,523 --> 00:08:31,634
Is that bad?

100
00:08:31,658 --> 00:08:34,370
I don't see...
Intrathoracic pressure.

101
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:36,539
No. His chest is
rising. He's breathing.

102
00:08:36,563 --> 00:08:40,276
No, the chest is
moving paradoxically.

103
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,699
The left lung is in distress.

104
00:08:49,075 --> 00:08:50,201
Yes.

105
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:57,515
Who here has a sharp knife,
blade, five inches or longer?

106
00:08:58,852 --> 00:08:59,962
Nobody?

107
00:08:59,986 --> 00:09:01,897
You should start
artificial respiration.

108
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:03,855
He's going to stop
breathing very soon.

109
00:09:08,995 --> 00:09:10,206
I feel fine.

110
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,426
Dr. Melendez would like
to do the surgery today.

111
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,893
You need bypass
surgery, quite urgently.

112
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:18,196
Would you please
sign the consent?

113
00:09:19,172 --> 00:09:20,196
No.

114
00:09:20,373 --> 00:09:21,397
You're scared.

115
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:22,985
I'm not scared.

116
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:25,821
Well, you should be. We're
gonna cut your chest open.

117
00:09:25,845 --> 00:09:28,657
We're gonna stop your
heart, repair it, and restart it.

118
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:31,360
You're seriously telling me
that that doesn't scare you?

119
00:09:31,384 --> 00:09:32,783
I just want a second opinion.

120
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:36,584
Callum, yesterday,
your life was perfect.

121
00:09:37,223 --> 00:09:40,102
You were playing tennis.
You had a big anniversary.

122
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:43,739
Today, you're lying in a hospital
bed trying to figure out the best way

123
00:09:43,763 --> 00:09:46,755
to say goodbye, maybe
forever, to your teenage children.

124
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,131
Why are you doing this?

125
00:09:50,136 --> 00:09:52,434
Because I can't deal with lies.

126
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:55,367
If you lie to me, my
answers won't help you.

127
00:09:56,075 --> 00:10:00,308
But, if you're scared,
I can help you.

128
00:10:03,283 --> 00:10:04,307
I'm scared.

129
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:06,409
Okay.

130
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:11,200
You can't be back here.

131
00:10:11,224 --> 00:10:12,301
I need a knife.

132
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:15,304
Where do you keep the knives
people forget they're traveling with?

133
00:10:15,328 --> 00:10:17,592
A knife? Sure. Anything else?

134
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:21,410
I do also need a
narrow six-foot tube

135
00:10:21,434 --> 00:10:24,380
and high-proof alcohol and
gloves and baggage-handling tape,

136
00:10:24,404 --> 00:10:26,782
but I'm gonna get the
alcohol from the duty-free store

137
00:10:26,806 --> 00:10:28,817
and the tube from the
back of the soda machine.

138
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:31,086
I wish you all the luck with that,
but I'm not gonna give you a knife.

139
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,978
I need a knife. It's very...
There is a medical emergency.

140
00:10:35,114 --> 00:10:37,947
There's a medical
emergency. That one.

141
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:41,497
That one right near the top looks
very sharp. Would you get it for me?

142
00:10:41,521 --> 00:10:43,512
I'm not gonna give
you a knife. I'll ask...

143
00:10:43,656 --> 00:10:44,987
There's not the time.

144
00:10:46,492 --> 00:10:48,119
Weapon! Weapon!

145
00:10:50,196 --> 00:10:51,823
Move! Get out of the way!

146
00:10:55,268 --> 00:10:56,292
Drop it.

147
00:10:57,437 --> 00:10:59,782
You idiot! You're lucky
we didn't just shoot.

148
00:10:59,806 --> 00:11:02,332
No! He's trying to
save my son's life.

149
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:12,649
You get that consent on 104?

150
00:11:12,986 --> 00:11:15,864
Well, I made him a deal.
He's got a meeting with Dr. Max

151
00:11:15,888 --> 00:11:18,867
from Psychiatry at 6:00.
We'll get the consent by 8:00.

152
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:20,602
We can operate first
thing in the morning.

153
00:11:20,626 --> 00:11:22,504
You did pass Anatomy,
right, Dr. Browne?

154
00:11:22,528 --> 00:11:23,939
His problem's in his
heart, not his head.

155
00:11:23,963 --> 00:11:27,126
He's not psychologically ready
for surgery. He will be soon.

156
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,345
He is physically
ready, so get consent.

157
00:11:29,369 --> 00:11:30,612
We're prepping OR-6 now.

158
00:11:30,636 --> 00:11:33,515
Do I need to cite you the 17
studies that show a correlation

159
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:35,871
between attitude and
outcome in surgical patients?

160
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:39,235
Do I need to remind you
that I am your superior?

161
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:42,048
You do know what the
opposite of superior is, right?

162
00:11:43,716 --> 00:11:45,294
Subordinate. It doesn't...

163
00:11:45,318 --> 00:11:47,878
Sure, subordinate,
or inferior. Either way.

164
00:11:48,321 --> 00:11:49,686
It doesn't mean I'm wrong.

165
00:11:50,523 --> 00:11:53,891
I suppose not. But it does mean
you have to act like you're wrong.

166
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,743
He's panic-stricken. Yesterday,
he was young and healthy.

167
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:02,011
Today, he's mortal.

168
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:04,697
Just give him a chance to
wrap his head around that.

169
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:10,566
Dr. Kalu?

170
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:15,179
Do you think you can get me a
signed informed consent on 104?

171
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:18,060
Of course.

172
00:12:18,084 --> 00:12:19,108
Thank you.

173
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:23,751
You think he's right?

174
00:12:24,891 --> 00:12:26,723
I think he's my boss.

175
00:12:29,095 --> 00:12:33,965
And if I have to choose between
my boss and the woman I'm screwing,

176
00:12:35,468 --> 00:12:37,368
not much of a
choice. Am I right?

177
00:12:42,108 --> 00:12:44,475
Excuse me. Excuse me, please.

178
00:13:33,426 --> 00:13:35,690
Incision should take
place two ribs down.

179
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:05,300
Okay, well, why the bottle?

180
00:14:05,324 --> 00:14:07,469
The air will continue
to leak and accumulate

181
00:14:07,493 --> 00:14:09,505
until the damage can
be properly repaired.

182
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:11,273
The tube allows
the air to get out.

183
00:14:11,297 --> 00:14:14,109
The water in the bottle stops
the air from coming back in.

184
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:15,362
A home-made one-way valve.

185
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,694
He's breathing.

186
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,640
You saved his life.
He saved his life!

187
00:14:40,326 --> 00:14:42,852
Shaun, where are you?

188
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,575
Call me as soon as you can,
please. That was a mistake.

189
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:48,644
I agree. This is not
about the new doctor.

190
00:14:48,668 --> 00:14:50,145
This is about you.
They're baiting you,

191
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:51,980
-and you're letting them.
-Maybe.

192
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:54,149
Maybe what? What mistake
are you talking about?

193
00:14:54,173 --> 00:14:56,699
- Your shot at Andrews' nephew.
- Come on, it was funny.

194
00:14:57,109 --> 00:14:59,521
It was very funny. It
was also disrespectful.

195
00:14:59,545 --> 00:15:02,391
You don't show him respect. I assume
it's because you don't respect him.

196
00:15:02,415 --> 00:15:04,593
You show someone respect
because you respect them

197
00:15:04,617 --> 00:15:07,095
or because you're afraid of
them. I don't fit into either category.

198
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:09,850
-Well, neither do I.
-You should.

199
00:15:10,623 --> 00:15:14,753
You're only in that room because
your grandfather founded this hospital.

200
00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:19,608
I'm gonna pretend that this
conversation didn't take this tangent

201
00:15:19,632 --> 00:15:22,795
and instead focus on something
relevant, the debate you are losing.

202
00:15:23,736 --> 00:15:26,548
Here's how you win this.
You don't make it personal.

203
00:15:26,572 --> 00:15:28,617
You don't make it about
you. That is what they want,

204
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:31,133
and if you give it to
them, you will lose.

205
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:38,581
I need to get to San Jose
Saint Bonaventure Hospital.

206
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:40,195
That's where we're going.

207
00:15:40,219 --> 00:15:41,243
Good.

208
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:52,107
How hard can it be to just
act like a normal human being?

209
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:53,475
He doesn't know how.

210
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:55,644
Bull! What are we
supposed to do now?

211
00:15:55,668 --> 00:15:58,046
This is the third school
he's been thrown out of.

212
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,414
We'll find another school.

213
00:15:59,438 --> 00:16:01,198
No, we won't, ‘cause
nothing's gonna change.

214
00:16:01,274 --> 00:16:03,252
They can't handle him,
and I don't blame them

215
00:16:03,276 --> 00:16:05,176
‘cause obviously we
can't handle him either.

216
00:16:05,344 --> 00:16:07,813
What the hell happened
this time? What happened?

217
00:16:07,947 --> 00:16:08,971
You're hurting him.

218
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:14,243
What did you do? Shaun!

219
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:15,631
No!

220
00:16:15,655 --> 00:16:17,623
Will you stop petting
that stupid rabbit?

221
00:16:30,303 --> 00:16:34,262
It changed. The
boy's ECG changed.

222
00:16:36,008 --> 00:16:38,253
It's the same, 86 BPM.

223
00:16:38,277 --> 00:16:40,507
No, it used to be higher.

224
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,191
No, it used to
be 86. It's still 86.

225
00:16:43,215 --> 00:16:44,614
It used to come up to here.

226
00:16:46,452 --> 00:16:50,532
Lower amplitude means lower voltage.
Lower amplitude means lower voltage.

227
00:16:50,556 --> 00:16:52,000
What's going on?
What does it mean?

228
00:16:52,024 --> 00:16:54,136
It means he's trying to
read 20-year-old equipment

229
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,686
while traveling in a vehicle
going 40 miles an hour.

230
00:16:57,863 --> 00:16:59,274
How did you get him to sign?

231
00:16:59,298 --> 00:17:01,960
I simply told him he was
either consenting or going home.

232
00:17:02,168 --> 00:17:04,569
Then I gave him two forms
and told him to pick one.

233
00:17:06,372 --> 00:17:09,217
And you highlighted the Release
Against Medical Advice form

234
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:12,211
that mentions the possibility of
death or permanent disability?

235
00:17:13,312 --> 00:17:15,891
Well done. Hand me
the Metz and a pickup.

236
00:17:15,915 --> 00:17:17,826
I'm isolating the
ascending aorta.

237
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:18,874
Vascular clamp.

238
00:17:20,252 --> 00:17:23,632
Hey, what is that?
Under the left atrium.

239
00:17:23,656 --> 00:17:27,251
Something white. Is
that part of the lung?

240
00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:32,674
It's pus. Did he have TB?

241
00:17:32,698 --> 00:17:33,975
No, he doesn't have any...

242
00:17:33,999 --> 00:17:35,077
No, not currently.
Does he have a history...

243
00:17:35,101 --> 00:17:36,345
When he was a younger,
he was exposed to...

244
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:38,030
This is an abscess.
It's going to...

245
00:17:39,338 --> 00:17:41,483
Suction and a lap
sponge. His BP's crashing.

246
00:17:41,507 --> 00:17:42,918
Two liters saline wide open.

247
00:17:42,942 --> 00:17:45,070
Set up level one. Two
units packed cells now.

248
00:17:45,678 --> 00:17:48,190
Let's get Levophed on board
and keep that MAP at 60.

249
00:17:48,214 --> 00:17:50,859
Get in there with the suction.
I can't see a damn thing.

250
00:17:50,883 --> 00:17:51,907
Suction.

251
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:54,062
I hope it isn't too
upsetting to him

252
00:17:54,086 --> 00:17:57,532
when he hears he'd have died in
his room if we'd waited till tomorrow.

253
00:17:57,556 --> 00:18:00,202
Dr. Melendez, we've got an
incoming eight-year-old male,

254
00:18:00,226 --> 00:18:03,105
pneumothorax stabilized but
undetermined internal injuries.

255
00:18:03,129 --> 00:18:04,358
Who do you want to catch?

256
00:18:04,563 --> 00:18:06,190
Claire, I don't
think we need you.

257
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:09,027
This patient is
gonna be fine now.

258
00:18:12,238 --> 00:18:13,582
Eight-year-old healthy boy.

259
00:18:13,606 --> 00:18:15,584
Status, post encounter
with a shattered glass sign.

260
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:16,973
-Numerous lacerations. -Echo.

261
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:20,255
Get him set up in Trauma 3
with an EKG, full blood work,

262
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:21,390
and a pan scan.

263
00:18:21,414 --> 00:18:23,892
- We need an echo. Echocardiogram.
- Who is this guy?

264
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,594
He helped with
first-aid at the airport.

265
00:18:25,618 --> 00:18:27,763
I'm a doctor. He needs
an echocardiogram.

266
00:18:27,787 --> 00:18:28,930
Where are you taking him?

267
00:18:28,954 --> 00:18:31,700
To surgery. All cardiac vital
signs are within normal range.

268
00:18:31,724 --> 00:18:34,803
- Do you have any ID?
- No. His heart. It's his heart.

269
00:18:34,827 --> 00:18:36,538
His heart is fine.
Now, stay here.

270
00:18:36,562 --> 00:18:38,440
Adam needs an echocardiogram.

271
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:41,297
No. Behave yourself, or you'll
be removed from the building.

272
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:55,777
Echo... Echo...

273
00:19:02,254 --> 00:19:03,278
What's that?

274
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:07,957
A one-way valve. EMT reports
the boy suffered a pneumothorax.

275
00:19:09,762 --> 00:19:11,287
That is cool.

276
00:19:18,337 --> 00:19:20,515
Do you think we should
do an echocardiogram?

277
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:23,018
Based on the presenting
symptoms, which give no indication

278
00:19:23,042 --> 00:19:26,979
that an echocardiogram is
necessary, I'm going to answer no.

279
00:19:28,147 --> 00:19:29,273
Am I missing something?

280
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:30,706
No, sir.

281
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,108
Knife.

282
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:24,513
We don't normally
treat rabbits, especially...

283
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:27,382
This was the closest doctor
place, and it was an emergency.

284
00:20:27,406 --> 00:20:29,584
No, I can see that.
But even if I was a vet,

285
00:20:29,608 --> 00:20:31,770
the rabbit is dead.

286
00:20:36,448 --> 00:20:37,745
I'm sorry, guys.

287
00:20:39,118 --> 00:20:41,086
Everything smells
different when it rains.

288
00:20:43,722 --> 00:20:44,883
What do we do now?

289
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:50,026
Well, you should
bury him, I guess.

290
00:20:50,596 --> 00:20:53,361
I don't know. Give
him a nice funeral.

291
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:55,062
Has he gone to heaven?

292
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:02,133
Yeah, sure. Sure. Sure, he has.

293
00:21:02,308 --> 00:21:05,141
No, I don't want him to go to
heaven. I want him to be here.

294
00:21:09,381 --> 00:21:10,592
This won't happen again.

295
00:21:10,616 --> 00:21:13,128
It can't happen
again. He's dead.

296
00:21:13,152 --> 00:21:14,262
I know that.

297
00:21:14,286 --> 00:21:18,199
I mean, nothing like this is ever
going to happen to us ever again.

298
00:21:18,223 --> 00:21:20,317
Because we're not going home.

299
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,428
We're never going home again.

300
00:21:23,762 --> 00:21:25,787
We have each other,
and that's all we need.

301
00:21:35,574 --> 00:21:37,804
A surgeon needs to communicate,

302
00:21:37,977 --> 00:21:43,058
not just information
but sympathy, empathy.

303
00:21:43,082 --> 00:21:45,126
Can Dr. Murphy do that?

304
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,915
He can't even reliably
show up for a job interview.

305
00:21:49,355 --> 00:21:50,732
Are you going to
sit here and tell us

306
00:21:50,756 --> 00:21:54,454
that there were no other
equally qualified young surgeons,

307
00:21:56,528 --> 00:21:59,862
surgeons without
this one's issues?

308
00:22:00,499 --> 00:22:05,494
No, which is why, exactly
why, we should hire Shaun.

309
00:22:05,638 --> 00:22:10,285
We should hire him because he is
qualified and because he's different.

310
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:13,822
How long ago was it that we wouldn't
hire black doctors in this hospital?

311
00:22:13,846 --> 00:22:17,258
How long ago was it that we
wouldn't hire female doctors

312
00:22:17,282 --> 00:22:18,477
at this hospital?

313
00:22:18,884 --> 00:22:22,797
So you're comparing being
African-American or a woman

314
00:22:22,821 --> 00:22:26,280
with being autistic?
Please, go on.

315
00:22:26,692 --> 00:22:27,955
Okay.

316
00:22:30,696 --> 00:22:33,165
The rationalization
is exactly the same.

317
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:36,363
Words like "temperament,"
and, "Oh, no.

318
00:22:36,568 --> 00:22:39,180
"Oh! How are the
patients going to react?"

319
00:22:39,204 --> 00:22:41,400
Aren't we judged by
how we treat people?

320
00:22:41,974 --> 00:22:44,375
I don't mean as doctors.
I mean as people.

321
00:22:45,044 --> 00:22:48,823
Especially those who don't have
the same advantages that we have.

322
00:22:48,847 --> 00:22:52,794
We hire Shaun, and we give
hope to those people with limitations

323
00:22:52,818 --> 00:22:55,830
that those limitations are
not what they think they are.

324
00:22:55,854 --> 00:22:57,822
That they do have a shot.

325
00:23:03,262 --> 00:23:07,722
We hire Shaun, and we
make this hospital better for it.

326
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,200
We hire Shaun, and we
are better people for it.

327
00:23:12,538 --> 00:23:14,836
We'd be better people

328
00:23:16,241 --> 00:23:19,108
spending a lot more on
malpractice insurance.

329
00:23:21,013 --> 00:23:22,257
How old is this kid again?

330
00:23:22,281 --> 00:23:23,339
Eight.

331
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,278
Sponge stick.

332
00:23:32,424 --> 00:23:34,064
What was his heart
rate five minutes ago?

333
00:23:34,426 --> 00:23:35,570
Eighty-six.

334
00:23:35,594 --> 00:23:36,705
You sure?

335
00:23:36,729 --> 00:23:38,959
Certain. He's been a
rock. It's barely changed.

336
00:23:39,732 --> 00:23:41,928
No, something's changed.
Something's different.

337
00:23:46,939 --> 00:23:49,084
You asked earlier about an
echo? You had no medical reason,

338
00:23:49,108 --> 00:23:50,371
but you asked anyway. Why?

339
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:54,456
There was this weird guy, the
one that did the one-way valve.

340
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,313
He kept insisting that the boy
needed an echocardiogram.

341
00:23:57,583 --> 00:24:00,052
- He didn't say why?
- He was really weird.

342
00:24:01,754 --> 00:24:04,232
His blood pressures
dropping. That makes no sense.

343
00:24:04,256 --> 00:24:06,782
He's not bleeding anymore.
Everything's under control.

344
00:24:07,826 --> 00:24:08,937
Do an echo.

345
00:24:08,961 --> 00:24:11,406
Sir, the boy's wide open.
It's gonna take a while.

346
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:14,576
Good. That'll give me time to figure
out why the hell we're doing an echo.

347
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,244
Dr. Browne, you're with
me. We're gonna go find

348
00:24:16,268 --> 00:24:17,667
your weird guy. Keep him stable.

349
00:24:21,473 --> 00:24:22,497
Why the echo?

350
00:24:25,144 --> 00:24:31,226
Okay. The... The...
Okay. The... I...

351
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:35,430
Okay. I understand you think
he needs an echocardiogram.

352
00:24:35,454 --> 00:24:36,580
We just don't know why.

353
00:24:37,923 --> 00:24:41,402
Well, I noticed that there was
a slight reduction in the intensity

354
00:24:41,426 --> 00:24:42,971
of the electrocardiogram.

355
00:24:42,995 --> 00:24:45,123
The electrical flow?
I noticed that, too.

356
00:24:45,264 --> 00:24:47,790
The heart rate was the same
but the amplitude dropped.

357
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,124
Pericardial effusion.

358
00:24:49,334 --> 00:24:50,512
Reduced cardiac output.

359
00:24:50,536 --> 00:24:51,799
Would stress other organs.

360
00:24:51,937 --> 00:24:53,314
Causing them to shut down.

361
00:24:53,338 --> 00:24:54,362
Yes.

362
00:24:56,809 --> 00:25:00,177
Hold on. Yeah. We're
coming right back up.

363
00:25:01,146 --> 00:25:02,307
Thank you.

364
00:25:03,382 --> 00:25:06,427
They did the echo. It's
normal. No pericardial effusion.

365
00:25:06,451 --> 00:25:09,097
No, it has to be. There
is no other explanation.

366
00:25:09,121 --> 00:25:12,284
The echo is normal, which
means we just wasted our time.

367
00:25:13,792 --> 00:25:14,816
No.

368
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:29,200
Okay. Hey. Come
with me. Come on.

369
00:25:43,555 --> 00:25:44,579
Show them.

370
00:25:54,066 --> 00:25:55,090
Again.

371
00:25:59,905 --> 00:26:00,929
Again.

372
00:26:02,608 --> 00:26:03,666
Again.

373
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,034
There.

374
00:26:06,912 --> 00:26:08,175
Looks normal to me.

375
00:26:08,513 --> 00:26:12,347
It's not normal. There's a concave
deformity in the right atrium.

376
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:14,349
No, there's not.

377
00:26:14,686 --> 00:26:16,598
Yes, there is. It's very subtle.

378
00:26:16,622 --> 00:26:18,199
Even if you are
right, that's not

379
00:26:18,223 --> 00:26:20,089
where a pericardial
effusion manifests.

380
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:27,521
Not usually. But it could.

381
00:26:29,635 --> 00:26:32,764
This kid was sprayed with
glass shards. Cut his jugular.

382
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:35,736
What if a piece of glass
entered his bloodstream?

383
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:39,187
It could have traveled
down the jugular vein

384
00:26:39,211 --> 00:26:42,146
into the brachiocephalic vein
and onto the superior vena cava.

385
00:26:42,481 --> 00:26:45,894
If it punctured the SVC, a block
could be leaking behind the heart,

386
00:26:45,918 --> 00:26:48,897
restricting the heart's ability to
expand and fill during diastole,

387
00:26:48,921 --> 00:26:50,446
reducing the heart's efficiency.

388
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,880
Lot of ifs there.

389
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:58,954
Dr. Chen,

390
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:02,165
prepare a 14-gauge
on the syringe.

391
00:27:06,605 --> 00:27:10,251
All in favor of ratifying
Dr. Glassman's decision in hiring

392
00:27:10,275 --> 00:27:11,606
Dr. Shaun Murphy?

393
00:27:16,148 --> 00:27:17,445
All against?

394
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,444
Excuse me.

395
00:27:22,587 --> 00:27:25,266
- Is this a medical emergency?
- No, no medical emergency.

396
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,501
Then you weren't
supposed to interrupt...

397
00:27:26,525 --> 00:27:28,469
Yes, I know, but
you need to go online.

398
00:27:28,493 --> 00:27:29,517
What? What site?

399
00:27:29,761 --> 00:27:33,493
Pretty much any of them. Twitter,
YouTube, any local news site.

400
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,694
You saved his life.

401
00:27:44,343 --> 00:27:47,522
The YouTube clip already
has over 200,000 views.

402
00:27:47,546 --> 00:27:49,310
Apparently, he's
one of our doctors.

403
00:27:50,682 --> 00:27:52,650
Dr. Shaun Murphy saved this boy.

404
00:27:54,553 --> 00:27:58,888
The boy is in OR-2. Dr. Melendez
isn't sure if he's going to make it.

405
00:28:09,468 --> 00:28:11,800
Your fiancé sure
can handle a knife.

406
00:28:14,373 --> 00:28:16,637
Why did you warn me about
respecting Dr. Andrews?

407
00:28:21,046 --> 00:28:22,172
What's going on?

408
00:28:22,414 --> 00:28:24,508
I'm not gonna always
be here to protect you.

409
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,415
You think you're gonna lose?

410
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,583
Everybody loses eventually.

411
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,255
Is that your guy?

412
00:28:53,545 --> 00:28:55,104
Can we get a TV?

413
00:28:55,414 --> 00:28:56,438
No.

414
00:28:56,782 --> 00:28:57,840
Why not?

415
00:28:59,284 --> 00:29:02,219
Because we're poor,
dude. We live in a bus.

416
00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:06,623
Do you think Mom
is looking for us?

417
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:08,451
No.

418
00:29:12,697 --> 00:29:16,691
She loves us, but she
knows it's better this way.

419
00:29:28,213 --> 00:29:29,408
I got you a present.

420
00:29:30,215 --> 00:29:31,307
It's not my birthday.

421
00:29:31,883 --> 00:29:33,317
I got you a present anyway.

422
00:29:51,336 --> 00:29:52,394
Here.

423
00:30:35,847 --> 00:30:37,008
Kelly.

424
00:30:53,732 --> 00:30:55,029
Dr. Browne,

425
00:30:59,304 --> 00:31:00,499
you were right.

426
00:31:19,724 --> 00:31:20,835
I don't like pickles.

427
00:31:20,859 --> 00:31:21,969
I know.

428
00:31:21,993 --> 00:31:23,070
I don't want pickles.

429
00:31:23,094 --> 00:31:24,323
And I checked.

430
00:31:26,998 --> 00:31:29,057
You saved that boy's life.

431
00:31:29,901 --> 00:31:30,925
Oh, good.

432
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:34,765
His name is Adam.
Traumatic pneumothorax.

433
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,764
I'm hungry.

434
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:43,070
The board reconvenes
in 45 minutes.

435
00:31:47,886 --> 00:31:49,547
Can you stay here
until I get back?

436
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,853
Okay.

437
00:31:55,427 --> 00:31:56,553
Okay.

438
00:32:04,636 --> 00:32:06,047
He's got a serious deficit.

439
00:32:06,071 --> 00:32:08,516
A child is alive today
because of that deficit.

440
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,685
And tomorrow, one may
be dead because of it.

441
00:32:10,709 --> 00:32:12,687
I seem to remember
that when I hired you,

442
00:32:12,711 --> 00:32:16,524
you weren't exactly making
the most adult decisions.

443
00:32:16,548 --> 00:32:18,744
You haven't killed
anyone yet, have you?

444
00:32:19,217 --> 00:32:22,152
Well, thankfully, there's a
cure for youth and stupidity,

445
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,617
time and experience.

446
00:32:24,155 --> 00:32:26,453
There's a cure for
stupidity? Okay.

447
00:32:26,891 --> 00:32:31,419
That would be a windfall.
All Shaun has is a diagnosis.

448
00:32:33,431 --> 00:32:36,992
I'd like your help. I take
it I'm not gonna get it.

449
00:32:38,837 --> 00:32:39,895
Okay.

450
00:32:41,606 --> 00:32:42,630
Wait.

451
00:32:43,842 --> 00:32:47,073
What's the story with this kid?
Why is it so important to you?

452
00:32:49,481 --> 00:32:50,812
Why not?

453
00:32:51,349 --> 00:32:53,394
Because letting
things get personal

454
00:32:53,418 --> 00:32:55,409
is a sure formula for
screwing things up.

455
00:32:57,022 --> 00:32:58,353
I don't know.

456
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:01,357
Letting things get
personal is how we...

457
00:33:02,761 --> 00:33:03,922
How we make it matter.

458
00:33:12,804 --> 00:33:15,466
So are you proud
or disappointed?

459
00:33:16,374 --> 00:33:18,274
Do I have to pick just one?

460
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,608
Hey.

461
00:33:29,954 --> 00:33:31,479
You're new to town, right?

462
00:33:32,157 --> 00:33:33,181
Yes.

463
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:35,503
Well, I'm sure you
have a lot of questions.

464
00:33:35,527 --> 00:33:36,551
No.

465
00:33:40,165 --> 00:33:43,311
You've got to be curious about
the place, about the people.

466
00:33:43,335 --> 00:33:46,013
Dr. Glassman gave
me a map of the hospital,

467
00:33:46,037 --> 00:33:48,529
and I got a map
of San Jose online.

468
00:33:51,643 --> 00:33:52,872
Okay.

469
00:33:53,578 --> 00:33:54,636
Great.

470
00:33:59,918 --> 00:34:01,249
I do have one question.

471
00:34:01,886 --> 00:34:03,012
Yeah.

472
00:34:05,423 --> 00:34:07,568
Why were you rude to
me when we first met,

473
00:34:07,592 --> 00:34:09,537
then nicer to me the
second time we met,

474
00:34:09,561 --> 00:34:11,552
and now you want
to be my friend?

475
00:34:12,497 --> 00:34:15,091
Which time was it that
you were pretending?

476
00:34:18,503 --> 00:34:21,063
Shaun, we're ready.

477
00:34:28,947 --> 00:34:31,659
The vote was clear. Why
are we reopening this?

478
00:34:31,683 --> 00:34:33,527
Is it really because
of a piece of publicity?

479
00:34:33,551 --> 00:34:35,863
It's because the man
just saved somebody's life.

480
00:34:35,887 --> 00:34:36,997
And thank God for that,

481
00:34:37,021 --> 00:34:38,899
but it doesn't change a
single thing we discussed.

482
00:34:38,923 --> 00:34:40,015
Give him six months.

483
00:34:40,458 --> 00:34:43,671
If he proves anything
less than excellent...

484
00:34:43,695 --> 00:34:45,959
Someone less than excellent
means someone else dies.

485
00:34:46,097 --> 00:34:48,843
Well, I would love to
make you happy, Doctor.

486
00:34:48,867 --> 00:34:52,098
I would love to hire someone
who never, ever makes a mistake.

487
00:34:52,237 --> 00:34:54,763
Unfortunately, God
already has a job.

488
00:34:55,273 --> 00:34:57,585
I can accept that
he will have insights

489
00:34:57,609 --> 00:34:59,270
that none of the
rest of us will have.

490
00:34:59,544 --> 00:35:01,122
Can you accept that
he will make mistakes

491
00:35:01,146 --> 00:35:02,423
none of the rest
of us will make?

492
00:35:02,447 --> 00:35:04,142
You won't be the one
who pays the price.

493
00:35:09,754 --> 00:35:14,201
If Shaun doesn't live up to
everything I know he can do,

494
00:35:14,225 --> 00:35:16,125
he will be immediately released,

495
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:20,998
and I will resign my position
as president of this hospital.

496
00:35:24,235 --> 00:35:26,465
We haven't heard
from Dr. Murphy yet.

497
00:35:26,671 --> 00:35:30,232
Perhaps we should hear from
him before we decide his fate.

498
00:35:31,676 --> 00:35:32,802
Shaun.

499
00:35:49,627 --> 00:35:54,408
Dr. Murphy, I'd
like you to tell us

500
00:35:54,432 --> 00:35:56,093
why you want to
become a surgeon.

501
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:16,664
Why do I want them
to be my friends?

502
00:36:16,688 --> 00:36:18,178
Everybody needs friends, Shaun.

503
00:36:18,823 --> 00:36:21,884
It's gonna be cool, okay?
Play hide-and-seek, maybe?

504
00:36:22,227 --> 00:36:24,127
-Okay. -Tag in the warehouse.

505
00:37:04,836 --> 00:37:06,547
I told you, it's fun, right?

506
00:37:14,078 --> 00:37:15,546
Hey. You know what?

507
00:37:52,717 --> 00:37:55,277
The day that the rain
smelled like ice cream,

508
00:37:57,355 --> 00:38:01,917
my bunny went to
heaven in front of my eyes.

509
00:38:05,863 --> 00:38:08,742
The day that the copper
pipes in the old building

510
00:38:08,766 --> 00:38:10,029
smelled like burnt food,

511
00:38:12,604 --> 00:38:14,163
my brother

512
00:38:16,641 --> 00:38:19,269
went to heaven
in front of my eyes.

513
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:27,015
I couldn't save them. It's sad.

514
00:38:30,188 --> 00:38:32,885
Neither one had the
chance to become an adult.

515
00:38:35,126 --> 00:38:38,152
They should have become adults.

516
00:38:41,032 --> 00:38:44,478
They should have had
children of their own

517
00:38:44,502 --> 00:38:47,403
and loved those children.

518
00:38:52,377 --> 00:38:56,211
And I want to make that
possible for other people.

519
00:39:07,425 --> 00:39:10,986
And I want to make a lot of money
so that I can have a television.

520
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,003
Dr. Murphy,

521
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,225
I want to be the
first to welcome you

522
00:39:31,249 --> 00:39:33,684
to San Jose Saint
Bonaventure Hospital.

523
00:39:37,355 --> 00:39:38,754
We're very proud to have you.

524
00:39:49,434 --> 00:39:50,911
Shaun,

525
00:39:50,935 --> 00:39:53,404
Dr. Melendez's team
is going into surgery.

526
00:39:55,073 --> 00:39:57,371
I mean, if you're interested.

527
00:40:59,504 --> 00:41:00,994
Got a messy field here.

528
00:41:02,273 --> 00:41:03,297
Murphy.

529
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,276
Suction.

530
00:41:20,358 --> 00:41:22,793
Never forget,
you're the smart one.

531
00:41:23,394 --> 00:41:24,657
You can do anything.

532
00:41:25,663 --> 00:41:27,392
And I'm proud of you, Shaun.

533
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:36,400
Thought you've
seen many of these.

534
00:41:39,177 --> 00:41:40,667
I remember my first.

535
00:41:42,013 --> 00:41:44,573
I kept thinking, "It doesn't
get any better than this."

536
00:41:46,184 --> 00:41:48,983
But for you, I'm afraid,
that's literally true.

537
00:41:51,989 --> 00:41:55,084
You're a nice kid, and
you're obviously very smart,

538
00:41:55,827 --> 00:41:57,226
but you don't belong here.

539
00:41:58,696 --> 00:42:00,541
So, as long as you're
part of my team,

540
00:42:00,565 --> 00:42:03,432
this is all you're ever
going to be doing, suction.

541
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,275
I saw a lot of surgeons
in medical school.

542
00:42:13,344 --> 00:42:14,903
You're much better than them.

543
00:42:15,346 --> 00:42:16,836
I have a lot to learn from you.

544
00:42:24,288 --> 00:42:25,585
You're very arrogant.

545
00:42:27,525 --> 00:42:29,687
Do you think that helps
you be a good surgeon?

546
00:42:31,596 --> 00:42:33,223
Does it hurt you as a person?

547
00:42:35,433 --> 00:42:36,867
Is it worth it?
