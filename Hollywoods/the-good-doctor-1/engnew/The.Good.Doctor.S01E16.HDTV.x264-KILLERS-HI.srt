three-point seat belt.

5

It was worth

6

7

go to see a movie afterwards,

<i>Atlas of Vascular Therapy</i>

11

Came into the E.R. this morning
complaining of severe neck pain.

17

show anterolisthesis.

18

of spinal trauma.

20

Hunter fractured seven
vertebrae in his neck and back

22
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,649

10 years ago.

23
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,250
He was one of
my first patients.

24
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:53,853
Suffered complete paralysis
from the chest down.

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,456
...a few months back,
just gnawing pain.

26
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,490
Ibuprofen usually
took the edge off.

27

- It's not that bad.
- Last night things changed.

30
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:06,766
He couldn't move
his neck at all,

31
00:01:06,832 --> 00:01:08,834
and the pain medicine
had no effect.

32
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,871
So, he wanted to tough it out,
but I dragged him in here.

33

- Mmm-hmm.

No.

looked like a herniated disc.
