1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:01,623
Previously on "The Good Doctor"...

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,178
How hard can it be

3
00:00:03,209 --> 00:00:05,481
to just act like a normal human being?!

4
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:06,772
No!

5
00:00:06,774 --> 00:00:08,533
Stop petting that stupid rabbit!

6
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:10,433
We're never going home again.

7
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,111
We have each other,
and that's all we need.

8
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:15,547
My brother went to heaven
in front of my eyes.

9
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,984
Never forget, you're the smart one.

10
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:21,186
And I'm proud of you, Shaun.

11
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:27,927
Dad?

12
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,788
Hey!

13
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,136
Yeah, I missed you, too!

14
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:38,999
Oh, Penny, come.

15
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:40,952
Stay.

16
00:00:41,185 --> 00:00:43,419
Hey, Dad.

17
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:45,577
Sorry it's so early. I just landed.

18
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,546
Actually, you're a bit late.

19
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:48,814
Five weeks.

20
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:50,888
I know. I know.

21
00:00:51,953 --> 00:00:55,779
I'm sorry.
I-I-It's a long story, okay?

22
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:57,890
But h-how was it?

23
00:00:57,892 --> 00:01:00,025
It was your mother's funeral.

24
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,697
Dad, I'm...

25
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:15,541
Okay.

26
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:17,810
Well, um, you have my cell number.

27
00:01:17,812 --> 00:01:20,264
It only works if you answer it.

28
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:29,254
Dad?

29
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,856
Dad?!

30
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,460
Hey, hey! Hey... you okay?

31
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:36,161
You okay? You can't breathe?!

32
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:38,455
No? No. Okay. I'm gonna call for help.

33
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:41,700
Yeah, 911? My dad collapsed!

34
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:43,335
He can't...
he can't breathe, please hurry!

35
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:44,575
Just hold on, Dad!

36
00:01:52,013 --> 00:01:53,645
Good morning, everyone!

37
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:55,481
Right on time. What, did you sleep here

38
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:58,250
or use a teleportation device?

39
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:00,686
I used a teleportation device.

40
00:02:02,423 --> 00:02:04,790
Nonsensical questions
usually imply sarcasm,

41
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,459
which I've found people
often answer sarcastically.

42
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:08,527
Good one.

43
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:11,330
Trauma wants a consult
on a 66-year-old male

44
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:13,599
who collapsed from severe anaphylaxis,

45
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:15,634
complicated by respiratory arrest.

46
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,169
His son just got back from Thailand.

47
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:19,304
Almost immediately,
the father had his allergic reaction.

48
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:23,108
Patient has a few allergies...

49
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,510
pollen, mold, shellfish...

50
00:02:24,512 --> 00:02:26,578
but no corresponding allergens
were in evidence.

51
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,028
Why are we doing a
surgical consult on an allergy?

52
00:02:29,053 --> 00:02:30,526
Well, we're not. We're doing a consult

53
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:32,751
on the excruciating
abdominal pain he now has.

54
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:38,256
As you may have heard.

55
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:41,748
Mr. Wilks, hi, I'm Dr. Neil Melendez.

56
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:43,762
Heard you had some abdominal pain.

57
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,786
The guy was in some serious pain...

58
00:03:20,788 --> 00:03:22,186
10 milligrams of morphine worth.

59
00:03:22,211 --> 00:03:24,122
Test results show elevated lipase,

60
00:03:24,124 --> 00:03:26,024
amylase, pancreatic enzymes.

61
00:03:26,026 --> 00:03:27,259
Pancreas is enlarged.

62
00:03:27,261 --> 00:03:29,661
Could be pancreatitis,
maybe alcohol-induced.

63
00:03:29,663 --> 00:03:31,163
The son said he smelled
alcohol on his father

64
00:03:31,165 --> 00:03:32,331
at 6:00 in the morning.

65
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,299
And anaphylaxis has been known
to precipitate

66
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:36,101
attacks of pancreatitis.

67
00:03:36,103 --> 00:03:37,502
Guess that's it, then.

68
00:03:39,606 --> 00:03:41,573
Meaning you totally disagree.

69
00:03:41,575 --> 00:03:43,342
Not everyone who starts
their day off with a Mimosa

70
00:03:43,344 --> 00:03:45,349
fries their pancreas.

71
00:03:45,404 --> 00:03:47,012
Your eyesight must a
hell of a lot better than mine.

72
00:03:47,014 --> 00:03:49,014
Because I can't see the entire pancreas

73
00:03:49,016 --> 00:03:50,916
due to the overlying bowel gas.

74
00:03:53,353 --> 00:03:55,787
We'll order an abdominal CT
and take a better look.

75
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:57,356
There you go.

76
00:03:57,358 --> 00:03:58,914
Where the hell is Murphy?

77
00:03:58,915 --> 00:04:00,402
It's a severe fracture,

78
00:04:00,424 --> 00:04:02,104
but I don't think you'll need pins.

79
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:03,996
Young bones tend to heal very well.

80
00:04:03,998 --> 00:04:07,799
Young Bones? Isn't that a "Star TREK:
Origins" graphic novel?

81
00:04:10,403 --> 00:04:13,005
I'm not sure.

82
00:04:13,007 --> 00:04:14,439
No, that was a joke.

83
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:15,741
Where are your parents?

84
00:04:15,743 --> 00:04:17,609
They're coming.
They both work in the city,

85
00:04:17,611 --> 00:04:19,378
so it's a long drive for them.

86
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,246
I was on a school field trip,

87
00:04:21,248 --> 00:04:22,781
and I tripped over my own feet.

88
00:04:22,783 --> 00:04:25,551
Of course,
it was right in front of Shelby Lomar.

89
00:04:25,553 --> 00:04:26,952
At least it was pretty gross,

90
00:04:26,954 --> 00:04:29,188
so I got some sympathy points for that.

91
00:04:32,325 --> 00:04:33,892
I would expect this to have been caused

92
00:04:33,894 --> 00:04:35,661
by a more serious accident.

93
00:04:35,663 --> 00:04:36,795
Nope, just a trip.

94
00:04:36,797 --> 00:04:37,963
I do that a lot.

95
00:04:37,965 --> 00:04:40,465
What can I say? I'm clumsy.

96
00:04:40,467 --> 00:04:42,501
Yes. Now follow my finger.

97
00:04:48,976 --> 00:04:50,342
You have some nystagmus...

98
00:04:50,344 --> 00:04:52,477
an involuntary eye movement.

99
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,580
So what's that mean?

100
00:04:54,582 --> 00:04:56,448
When you fell, did you hit your head?

101
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,583
No.

102
00:04:57,585 --> 00:04:59,084
What, you think I have brain damage?

103
00:04:59,086 --> 00:05:01,653
Nystagmus can be a sign
of a neurological issue.

104
00:05:01,655 --> 00:05:02,591
Oh.

105
00:05:02,616 --> 00:05:05,185
Well, that would explain the "C"
I got in social studies.

106
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,961
That was another joke, wasn't it?

107
00:05:08,963 --> 00:05:10,213
Mm.

108
00:05:11,098 --> 00:05:13,398
I'm going to order a head CT for you.

109
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,833
Go for it.

110
00:05:18,004 --> 00:05:19,638
Shaun, are you getting any sleep?

111
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,073
Yes.
Really?

112
00:05:21,075 --> 00:05:22,574
I mean, really getting sleep?

113
00:05:22,576 --> 00:05:23,909
I got here on time.

114
00:05:23,911 --> 00:05:24,943
Well, that's good.

115
00:05:24,945 --> 00:05:27,279
I used a teleportation device.

116
00:05:31,785 --> 00:05:34,019
Radiology form, please.

117
00:05:39,093 --> 00:05:40,842
Shaun, that boy, he looks like...

118
00:05:40,844 --> 00:05:41,904
Steve.

119
00:05:41,929 --> 00:05:43,328
He does.

120
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,896
Is he related?

121
00:05:44,898 --> 00:05:47,733
His name is Evan Gallico,
so I don't think so.

122
00:05:50,103 --> 00:05:51,737
Wow. That is uncanny.

123
00:05:51,739 --> 00:05:53,171
Just coincidental.

124
00:05:53,173 --> 00:05:55,374
He looks exactly like your brother.

125
00:05:55,376 --> 00:05:56,408
No, he doesn't.

126
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,243
His hair is shorter.

127
00:05:58,245 --> 00:06:00,045
It freaks me out.
It doesn't freak you out?

128
00:06:00,047 --> 00:06:01,613
No.

129
00:06:01,615 --> 00:06:04,683
It's okay if it does...
No, he's not Steve. Steve's dead.

130
00:06:09,163 --> 00:06:11,657
"I used a teleportation device"
was a joke.

131
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:15,761
Yeah, that's... that's good.

132
00:06:24,404 --> 00:06:26,972
So, I couldn't come to Mom's funeral

133
00:06:26,974 --> 00:06:29,207
because I fell in love.

134
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:33,011
She was another teacher at the school.

135
00:06:33,013 --> 00:06:34,945
A Thai woman.

136
00:06:35,182 --> 00:06:36,548
And she was kind and...

137
00:06:36,608 --> 00:06:39,811
and beautiful and loving...

138
00:06:40,954 --> 00:06:43,514
and very, very sick.

139
00:06:43,857 --> 00:06:46,391
She had a congenital heart defect.

140
00:06:51,931 --> 00:06:55,901
Look, if you don't want to
tell me where you've been

141
00:06:55,903 --> 00:06:57,469
for the last six months, then don't.

142
00:06:57,471 --> 00:06:58,503
It's your business.

143
00:06:58,505 --> 00:07:00,272
But don't insult my intelligence.

144
00:07:00,274 --> 00:07:01,707
Well, I couldn't just leave her.

145
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:03,141
You couldn't leave her for five minutes

146
00:07:03,143 --> 00:07:04,176
to make a phone call?

147
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,913
This a bad time?

148
00:07:07,915 --> 00:07:11,316
No, come in.

149
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:16,822
According to the CT,

150
00:07:16,824 --> 00:07:18,457
you have a lesion on your pancreas.

151
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:20,025
Well,
what do you think this lesion could be?

152
00:07:20,027 --> 00:07:20,992
Not sure.

153
00:07:20,994 --> 00:07:22,828
That's why we need to biopsy it.

154
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,863
It could just be a benign cyst.

155
00:07:24,865 --> 00:07:25,848
Or...?

156
00:07:25,873 --> 00:07:27,187
Or...

157
00:07:28,235 --> 00:07:31,232
it could be cancer, right?

158
00:07:31,305 --> 00:07:32,938
We'll know soon enough.

159
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,548
This won't take long.

160
00:07:51,692 --> 00:07:53,625
I know. I've had two of these.

161
00:07:53,627 --> 00:07:55,293
One more and I get my Scout badge.

162
00:07:59,665 --> 00:08:00,732
That was funny.

163
00:08:00,734 --> 00:08:02,501
Tough to tell without looking at you,

164
00:08:02,503 --> 00:08:04,870
but I'm guessing that was sarcasm.

165
00:08:04,872 --> 00:08:06,938
No. I have autism,

166
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,242
which makes it hard for me
to read social cues.

167
00:08:10,244 --> 00:08:11,443
Jokes are difficult.

168
00:08:11,445 --> 00:08:14,045
I used to know a kid with autism. Peter.

169
00:08:14,047 --> 00:08:17,949
He was kind of weird but super nice.

170
00:08:17,951 --> 00:08:19,484
Used to know?

171
00:08:19,486 --> 00:08:21,319
You don't know him anymore?

172
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:22,821
He died.

173
00:08:22,823 --> 00:08:25,123
Hit by a car.

174
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,692
You know anyone who died?

175
00:08:27,694 --> 00:08:29,361
My brother.

176
00:08:29,363 --> 00:08:30,529
That sucks.

177
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,201
Why did you have the other CT scans?

178
00:08:36,203 --> 00:08:38,537
My parents have...

179
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,605
uh, what's the word for
fear of getting sick?

180
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:42,340
Hypochondriasis?

181
00:08:42,342 --> 00:08:44,276
Mm, no, worse than that.

182
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:46,978
They have... nosophobia.

183
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,847
I love that word.

184
00:08:48,849 --> 00:08:51,750
What do you think of Miss Gannett?

185
00:08:51,752 --> 00:08:52,951
She's nice.

186
00:08:52,953 --> 00:08:55,954
I think she's callipygian.

187
00:08:55,956 --> 00:08:57,456
She's what?

188
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:58,690
Callipygian?

189
00:08:58,692 --> 00:09:01,526
It means "having shapely buttocks,"
Shaun.

190
00:09:01,528 --> 00:09:02,661
Duh.

191
00:09:05,264 --> 00:09:06,932
You read the dictionary.

192
00:09:06,934 --> 00:09:09,935
What it lacks in plot,
it makes up for in vocab.

193
00:09:09,937 --> 00:09:12,637
So, you married?

194
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,940
Girlfriend?

195
00:09:14,942 --> 00:09:16,608
Boyfriend?

196
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,009
Tropical fish?

197
00:09:20,213 --> 00:09:21,713
I like Lea.

198
00:09:21,715 --> 00:09:23,915
Ooh. And who's Lea?

199
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:25,150
Lea is a friend.

200
00:09:25,152 --> 00:09:27,152
A friend you date?

201
00:09:27,154 --> 00:09:29,254
A friend with benefits?

202
00:09:29,256 --> 00:09:31,923
I lend her batteries sometimes.

203
00:09:31,925 --> 00:09:32,958
I like where this is going...

204
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,031
So, you know, keep going.

205
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:42,334
'Cause if you don't, I will.

206
00:09:42,336 --> 00:09:43,969
It's kind of my thing, you know?

207
00:09:43,971 --> 00:09:46,171
Just constant talking...
annoys everyone.

208
00:09:46,213 --> 00:09:48,513
Murphy.
Well, I guess not everyone.

209
00:09:48,538 --> 00:09:49,467
Hey.

210
00:09:49,491 --> 00:09:51,099
My family's pretty used to me now.
I mean...

211
00:09:51,885 --> 00:09:54,619
my friends are very talkative as well,
so...

212
00:09:54,621 --> 00:09:56,321
You're giving
the fractured arm a head CT?

213
00:09:56,323 --> 00:09:57,725
Yes.
Get back to the pancreas.

214
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,790
He's not clumsy.

215
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:01,393
He has a brain tumor
behind the inner ear.

216
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:05,196
Forget the pancreas.

217
00:10:12,138 --> 00:10:14,205
Mr. and Mrs. Gallico?

218
00:10:14,207 --> 00:10:15,607
Hi.
Hi.

219
00:10:15,609 --> 00:10:16,908
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

220
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,076
I'm treating your son.

221
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:19,144
Well, how is he?

222
00:10:19,146 --> 00:10:20,512
We were told it was a bad break,

223
00:10:20,514 --> 00:10:22,180
but it should heal no problem.

224
00:10:22,182 --> 00:10:23,782
I know why Evan tripped.

225
00:10:23,784 --> 00:10:26,585
He had a tumor in the temporal
bone behind his left ear,

226
00:10:26,587 --> 00:10:28,253
which is affecting his balance.

227
00:10:28,255 --> 00:10:30,922
I've arranged for a consult
with Dr. Najid in oncology

228
00:10:30,924 --> 00:10:32,424
and she's going...
No, that won't be necessary.

229
00:10:32,426 --> 00:10:33,900
We...

230
00:10:34,027 --> 00:10:36,094
We already have an oncologist.

231
00:10:37,931 --> 00:10:40,879
Evan's been diagnosed with
stage four osteosarcoma.

232
00:10:41,335 --> 00:10:43,335
He was complaining of a sore shin.

233
00:10:43,337 --> 00:10:47,205
The last thing that we expected
was bone cancer.

234
00:10:47,207 --> 00:10:48,406
The doctors at SFM,

235
00:10:48,408 --> 00:10:50,942
they gave him a year to live.

236
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,309
That was seven months ago.

237
00:10:56,727 --> 00:11:00,028
Osteosarcoma explains
the severity of his fracture...

238
00:11:00,053 --> 00:11:02,487
he will need pins in his arm after all.

239
00:11:02,489 --> 00:11:03,788
Uh, can we see him?

240
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,191
Yes. He's in room 414.

241
00:11:06,193 --> 00:11:07,959
Uh, Dr. Murphy?

242
00:11:10,363 --> 00:11:13,352
He doesn't know about his diagnosis.

243
00:11:13,768 --> 00:11:17,404
We would really like
to keep it that way.

244
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:27,786
He's the patient.

245
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,655
Doesn't he have the right
to know the truth?

246
00:11:29,657 --> 00:11:30,756
Well, no.

247
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:32,992
He's also a minor, so, no, he doesn't.

248
00:11:32,994 --> 00:11:34,293
Evan's very intelligent...

249
00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:35,427
he'd be able to handle it.

250
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:37,897
Well, Shaun,
maybe it's not just about Evan.

251
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:40,799
Maybe it's about his parents, as well.

252
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:44,670
Maybe it's just too difficult
for them to tell Evan right now.

253
00:11:44,672 --> 00:11:45,738
I don't know.

254
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,072
Then they're the ones
who shouldn't be told.

255
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:48,674
Well, let me ask you this, Shaun...

256
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:51,687
what's so wrong about Evan being allowed

257
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:54,413
to enjoy as much of
his life as possible?

258
00:11:54,415 --> 00:11:56,148
Evan wants to know the truth.

259
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,349
How do you know that?

260
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:04,990
If this were Steve,
if this were your brother,

261
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:06,292
would he want to know the truth?

262
00:12:06,294 --> 00:12:07,660
Is that what this is?

263
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,134
Dad's such a tool.

264
00:12:15,136 --> 00:12:16,335
I found my birthday present...

265
00:12:16,337 --> 00:12:18,103
in their closet,
right where they always hide it.

266
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:19,238
I was just about to open it

267
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,340
when Dad caught me snooping
and freaked out.

268
00:12:21,342 --> 00:12:24,510
I hate all that phony surprise stuff.

269
00:12:24,512 --> 00:12:27,513
It's an AquaBlast Water Cannon.

270
00:12:27,515 --> 00:12:29,815
I was with Mom when she bought it.

271
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:31,116
Thank you, Shaun.

272
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:33,085
Your honesty's refreshing!

273
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:39,892
Yes, he would want to know the truth.

274
00:12:39,894 --> 00:12:42,494
Well,
there's nothing we can do about it.

275
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:44,430
It's not your decision... it's theirs.

276
00:12:44,432 --> 00:12:45,898
He's their son.

277
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:02,581
Claire, I need you.

278
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,118
Sure, what's up?

279
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,905
I need someone to lie for me.

280
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:12,003
Okay...

281
00:13:12,877 --> 00:13:14,610
I'm flattered?

282
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:20,440
Hey, doc?

283
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:23,769
There's something I need to tell my dad.

284
00:13:23,771 --> 00:13:26,772
We haven't moved him.
He's still in room, uh, 326.

285
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:31,872
Do you have a medical question for me?

286
00:13:33,014 --> 00:13:34,446
Is he dying?

287
00:13:34,448 --> 00:13:35,781
We don't know yet.

288
00:13:35,783 --> 00:13:37,783
The biopsy will tell us more.

289
00:13:37,785 --> 00:13:38,917
Okay.

290
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:45,157
My dad is a good guy.

291
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:50,709
We've just never been on the same page,
you know?

292
00:13:51,532 --> 00:13:54,824
My mother was the one
that I could talk to...

293
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:57,145
same for him.

294
00:13:57,738 --> 00:14:01,238
So, without her,

295
00:14:01,742 --> 00:14:04,009
we're both pretty useless.

296
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:12,184
Room 326.

297
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:13,686
Right.

298
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:23,028
Dr. Murphy called me in
for a second opinion.

299
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:27,287
Um, you need some pins in your arm.

300
00:14:27,312 --> 00:14:28,367
Why?

301
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:29,902
What's changed?

302
00:14:29,904 --> 00:14:32,137
Well,
after studying the radiology report,

303
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:33,706
given how bad the break is,

304
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,708
we just think it would be
a prudent step...

305
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:38,977
to ensure an efficient and
thorough mending to the break.

306
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:41,113
Will I be able to play baseball again?

307
00:14:41,115 --> 00:14:42,648
Well, I don't see why not,

308
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,982
once it's completely healed,

309
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:45,551
after some physiotherapy.

310
00:14:45,553 --> 00:14:47,252
How long before I can pitch?

311
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:49,088
It's hard to say.

312
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:57,035
He wanted someone to lie for him.

313
00:14:57,979 --> 00:15:00,987
And he picked you.

314
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:03,569
Merrill's son asked for personal advice.

315
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:04,737
And he picked you.

316
00:15:04,739 --> 00:15:06,372
I know, right?

317
00:15:06,374 --> 00:15:09,254
He's lying to his dad about something.

318
00:15:09,844 --> 00:15:11,343
Yeah? What?

319
00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:12,811
I don't know.

320
00:15:12,813 --> 00:15:14,279
You didn't ask?

321
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:17,693
It didn't seem relevant, medically.

322
00:15:17,885 --> 00:15:20,786
You know it's not that difficult
to be a human being.

323
00:15:20,788 --> 00:15:23,122
Just tell him to "come clean,"

324
00:15:23,124 --> 00:15:25,491
"honesty is the best policy,"

325
00:15:25,493 --> 00:15:28,026
"a lie is a stone in your heart."

326
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:29,461
Who said the last one?

327
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:30,829
Me.

328
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:31,864
I made it up.

329
00:15:31,866 --> 00:15:32,765
Hmm.

330
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:37,936
And... I got it.

331
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,546
He's anaphylactic.

332
00:15:41,571 --> 00:15:42,574
Would you get me an epi?
I'm coming out.

333
00:15:42,576 --> 00:15:44,476
The throat's constricting.
Pull the tube!

334
00:15:57,557 --> 00:16:01,458
So, what's up with "Dr. Browne"?

335
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:03,708
She's Lea, isn't she?

336
00:16:05,109 --> 00:16:06,308
Claire is my colleague.

337
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:10,542
Oh, come on,
I saw the way you were looking at her.

338
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:11,703
How?

339
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,808
I don't think I look like that.

340
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,977
Okay, so then why'd you
call her in for a "consult"?

341
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:20,677
Mm...

342
00:16:21,449 --> 00:16:22,959
Okay.

343
00:16:23,506 --> 00:16:27,041
Yes, she's better at talking
to people than I am.

344
00:16:27,098 --> 00:16:30,340
Wow. I counted like 50 tells there.

345
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:32,988
You really suck at lying.
I know.

346
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:35,360
Too bad. It's an important social skill.

347
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,204
So how do you know when to lie?

348
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:41,934
When people need to know things,

349
00:16:41,936 --> 00:16:42,901
they need to know.

350
00:16:42,903 --> 00:16:44,403
If they don't,

351
00:16:44,405 --> 00:16:46,238
lie through your teeth
and feel good about it.

352
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,706
What if they need to know the truth,

353
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,041
but it'll hurt them?

354
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:55,781
Some can handle it, some can't.

355
00:16:55,783 --> 00:16:58,217
So how do you know
who can and who can't?

356
00:16:58,219 --> 00:16:59,418
You tell the truth.

357
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,954
If they like you after,
then you'll know.

358
00:17:01,956 --> 00:17:03,222
If they don't?

359
00:17:03,224 --> 00:17:05,824
Then it doesn't really matter anyway.

360
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,164
You have cancer.

361
00:17:16,871 --> 00:17:20,038
Yeah, I know.

362
00:17:27,644 --> 00:17:30,251
My parents took me in for a sore leg.

363
00:17:30,337 --> 00:17:31,703
After a whole bunch of tests,

364
00:17:31,705 --> 00:17:32,871
they talked to the doctor,

365
00:17:32,873 --> 00:17:35,140
then came out and told me I was fine.

366
00:17:35,142 --> 00:17:37,860
That's it. Just "fine."

367
00:17:38,245 --> 00:17:41,344
The next day, they bought me a PS4.

368
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:44,116
So I Googled my symptoms,

369
00:17:44,118 --> 00:17:46,485
and I narrowed it down to osteosarcoma

370
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:47,828
or growing pains.

371
00:17:48,055 --> 00:17:51,156
Kids don't get gaming systems
for growing pains.

372
00:17:53,025 --> 00:17:56,728
Hey, it's okay.

373
00:17:59,198 --> 00:18:00,632
I'm not afraid to die.

374
00:18:00,634 --> 00:18:02,167
You're not?

375
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:04,169
Well, I mean, the dying part will suck

376
00:18:04,171 --> 00:18:06,660
if it hurts, but...

377
00:18:07,808 --> 00:18:10,075
I'm not afraid about
the actual death part.

378
00:18:10,077 --> 00:18:12,711
Because you believe
you're going to Heaven?

379
00:18:12,713 --> 00:18:14,246
Because I don't.

380
00:18:17,016 --> 00:18:18,517
If I believe in Heaven,

381
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:20,018
then I got to believe in God,

382
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,487
then I got to believe God made me sick.

383
00:18:22,489 --> 00:18:24,923
How messed up is that?

384
00:18:24,925 --> 00:18:28,475
It's just easier to think
that it's all random

385
00:18:28,562 --> 00:18:30,553
and when it's over,

386
00:18:30,687 --> 00:18:32,647
it's just...

387
00:18:35,435 --> 00:18:36,635
over.

388
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,275
So what about Lea?

389
00:18:43,277 --> 00:18:45,443
Where'd you guys meet?

390
00:18:45,445 --> 00:18:47,012
In the hallway.

391
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,417
That's a beautiful story.

392
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:53,718
Yes.

393
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,453
She's my neighbor.

394
00:18:55,455 --> 00:18:58,021
Convenient.

395
00:18:58,225 --> 00:18:59,825
He had another allergic reaction.

396
00:18:59,827 --> 00:19:02,427
The pancreas?
Merrill Wilks, yeah.

397
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:04,930
And the second attack was even
more severe than the first.

398
00:19:04,932 --> 00:19:07,032
It coincided with biopsying
the pancreatic lesion,

399
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:08,433
which now appears was a cyst.

400
00:19:08,435 --> 00:19:10,569
Well, now we know he's allergic to
whatever's in that cyst.

401
00:19:10,571 --> 00:19:12,204
We also that the next cyst that pops

402
00:19:12,206 --> 00:19:14,306
will probably kill him.
Well, if there is a next.

403
00:19:14,308 --> 00:19:15,473
Let's run a couple tests,

404
00:19:15,475 --> 00:19:16,975
see if there's any evidence
of parasites.

405
00:19:16,977 --> 00:19:18,310
And MRI his entire body...

406
00:19:18,312 --> 00:19:19,644
if we're lucky,
he only had the two cysts

407
00:19:19,646 --> 00:19:20,779
and he can go home.

408
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:26,502
Are you looking for loopholes?

409
00:19:26,653 --> 00:19:28,119
Hoping to save Evan?

410
00:19:28,121 --> 00:19:30,222
Everyone makes mistakes.

411
00:19:30,224 --> 00:19:31,489
Which means you should double-check

412
00:19:31,491 --> 00:19:33,124
every file in the hospital.

413
00:19:33,126 --> 00:19:38,263
The oncologist flagged his
neutrophil count of 634 as low.

414
00:19:38,265 --> 00:19:39,197
That is low.

415
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:40,265
Low normal.

416
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,461
I can still hear
the word "low" in there.

417
00:19:42,486 --> 00:19:43,953
Mm.

418
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,117
He's just a kid.

419
00:19:49,343 --> 00:19:52,272
I know how hard it is
to think of him dying.

420
00:19:52,446 --> 00:19:54,585
He's okay with that.

421
00:19:54,848 --> 00:19:56,448
I find that hard to believe.

422
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,682
We all die...

423
00:19:57,684 --> 00:19:59,918
if we accepted that, we'd be happier.

424
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,842
Maybe. But we're not good
with contentment.

425
00:20:04,491 --> 00:20:06,858
Fighting death is what keeps us alive.

426
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,200
Okay.

427
00:20:16,802 --> 00:20:18,536
We got a hit... Echinococcus.

428
00:20:18,538 --> 00:20:20,238
Echinococcus?

429
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,406
The cysts are filled with tapeworms?

430
00:20:21,408 --> 00:20:22,941
Cysts? There are more?

431
00:20:22,943 --> 00:20:24,643
Three more?
Four more.

432
00:20:24,645 --> 00:20:26,011
You missed the one in his brain.

433
00:20:29,249 --> 00:20:31,049
Dr. Glassman?

434
00:20:31,051 --> 00:20:32,284
Yeah?

435
00:20:32,286 --> 00:20:33,919
You used to be a neurosurgeon, right?

436
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:35,320
So they say.

437
00:20:35,322 --> 00:20:36,621
Take this, will you?

438
00:20:38,691 --> 00:20:39,858
I need one.

439
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,092
Who would you recommend?

440
00:20:41,094 --> 00:20:42,560
What you got?

441
00:20:48,434 --> 00:20:50,035
Wow, that's cool.

442
00:20:52,705 --> 00:20:55,040
How the hell did I get
tapeworms in my head?

443
00:20:55,042 --> 00:20:57,008
No idea, but you do.

444
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,277
You can pick up the eggs
from coyotes or wolves.

445
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:01,246
You been hanging around
coyotes or wolves?

446
00:21:01,248 --> 00:21:02,547
I live in the suburbs...

447
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:03,949
we don't even have a petting zoo.

448
00:21:03,951 --> 00:21:06,518
You might've had these cysts
for quite some time.

449
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,819
When one of them burst,

450
00:21:07,821 --> 00:21:09,988
that's what caused
the first allergic reaction.

451
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,890
Well, why did it burst?

452
00:21:11,892 --> 00:21:13,425
Why did it burst?

453
00:21:13,427 --> 00:21:16,928
Any sudden movements,
twists, turns, squeeze.

454
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:17,963
A hug?

455
00:21:17,965 --> 00:21:19,430
Could be.

456
00:21:20,901 --> 00:21:22,968
But you weren't there
for the second one.

457
00:21:25,137 --> 00:21:27,605
I punctured the cyst on your pancreas

458
00:21:27,607 --> 00:21:29,040
during the biopsy.

459
00:21:29,042 --> 00:21:31,710
As you've seen,
allergic reactions get worse

460
00:21:31,712 --> 00:21:32,777
each time they happen.

461
00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:34,346
So a third one, that would be bad.

462
00:21:34,348 --> 00:21:35,847
That would be...

463
00:21:35,849 --> 00:21:36,948
That would be very bad.

464
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,917
So we're gonna have to
surgically remove...

465
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:41,086
all the cysts intact.

466
00:21:41,088 --> 00:21:43,321
Dr. Glassman's
one of the most highly acclaimed

467
00:21:43,323 --> 00:21:44,389
neurosurgeons in the state.

468
00:21:44,391 --> 00:21:45,757
You are very lucky to have him.

469
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:49,794
And Dr. Kalu is fast becoming
a very accomplished flatterer.

470
00:21:49,796 --> 00:21:52,897
The cranial cyst, that is a big deal.

471
00:21:52,899 --> 00:21:55,400
We're gonna have to take off
the top of your skull.

472
00:21:55,402 --> 00:21:57,469
You'd be digging in to my brain?

473
00:21:57,471 --> 00:21:58,937
Well, yeah, pretty much.

474
00:21:58,939 --> 00:21:59,971
With saline.

475
00:21:59,973 --> 00:22:01,706
We use it to gently displace the cyst,

476
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,975
and then, poof, it magically pops out.

477
00:22:03,977 --> 00:22:05,210
Kind of like delivering a baby.

478
00:22:05,212 --> 00:22:07,846
You know, if childbirth were painless.

479
00:22:07,848 --> 00:22:10,870
And then we move on to the other cysts.

480
00:22:11,051 --> 00:22:13,318
Hey, we're gonna take good care of you.

481
00:23:18,585 --> 00:23:20,685
Evan doesn't have cancer.

482
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:27,317
Cowards cowering in concrete
showers in Rikers Island

483
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,915
Victims,
we the wolves that's wilding

484
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,602
We often smilin'
at sights of violence

485
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:31,941
Acting brave and courageous

486
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:33,510
Ain't advantageous
for health and safety

487
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:34,978
So when we say "run the jewels"

488
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,579
It might not be cancer!

489
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,314
And that goes for a guy or lady

490
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,283
It might not be cancer!

491
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,120
Look at you on time... two for two.

492
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:45,789
It might not be cancer.

493
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,924
Fractured arm?
Yes.

494
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,500
You said he'd been diagnosed
with stage four osteosarcoma.

495
00:23:50,525 --> 00:23:53,344
Evan was diagnosed with
the flu eight months ago,

496
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:54,922
but his symptoms were
actually a better fit

497
00:23:54,947 --> 00:23:56,213
with Epstein-Barr virus,

498
00:23:56,215 --> 00:23:58,249
which is linked to
Langerhans cell histiocytosis,

499
00:23:58,251 --> 00:23:59,784
which causes osteolytic lesions

500
00:23:59,786 --> 00:24:01,185
in the long bones of the upper limbs.

501
00:24:01,187 --> 00:24:02,920
And those lesions could be misdiagnosed

502
00:24:02,922 --> 00:24:04,121
as signs of osteosarcoma.

503
00:24:04,123 --> 00:24:05,566
Yes.
What about his brain tumor?

504
00:24:05,591 --> 00:24:08,239
Langerhans can also manifest
in the skull.

505
00:24:09,362 --> 00:24:10,761
Instead of a death sentence,

506
00:24:10,763 --> 00:24:12,029
he could have something
that could easily

507
00:24:12,031 --> 00:24:13,164
be treated with prednisone?

508
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:16,534
Next, we need to do a bone-marrow
aspiration to confirm.

509
00:24:16,536 --> 00:24:17,835
I assume you've looked at his file.

510
00:24:17,837 --> 00:24:18,969
For a very long time.

511
00:24:18,971 --> 00:24:20,271
Well, there must've been a biopsy.

512
00:24:20,273 --> 00:24:21,539
What did the pathology report say?

513
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:22,907
Yes. There were two biopsies.

514
00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:25,779
Both were positive for osteosarcoma.

515
00:24:26,512 --> 00:24:29,458
Murphy...
They could be false positives.

516
00:24:29,482 --> 00:24:30,948
Do you have any idea how unlikely it is

517
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,049
to have two false positives?

518
00:24:32,051 --> 00:24:33,217
0.3%.

519
00:24:33,219 --> 00:24:34,819
Which we can comfortably
round off to "not likely."

520
00:24:34,821 --> 00:24:36,253
It is possible...

521
00:24:36,255 --> 00:24:38,422
Yes, but it means telling
the parents of a dying child

522
00:24:38,424 --> 00:24:40,546
that there's hope,
when really there isn't.

523
00:24:41,803 --> 00:24:43,469
Grab a shower and get ready for rounds.

524
00:24:49,768 --> 00:24:51,402
Wow.

525
00:24:51,404 --> 00:24:53,671
Imaginative and creative.
Yes.

526
00:24:53,673 --> 00:24:54,939
What are the chances you're right?

527
00:24:54,941 --> 00:24:56,040
0.3%.

528
00:24:56,042 --> 00:24:57,308
330 to 1.

529
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,944
333 to 1.

530
00:24:59,946 --> 00:25:01,545
You really think that it's worth

531
00:25:01,547 --> 00:25:03,180
putting Evan's parents through all this?

532
00:25:03,182 --> 00:25:04,381
Of course.

533
00:25:04,383 --> 00:25:06,650
If we did this 333 times,

534
00:25:06,652 --> 00:25:09,053
we'd be giving false hope
to 332 people...

535
00:25:09,055 --> 00:25:10,521
for approximately four hours,

536
00:25:10,523 --> 00:25:11,789
and we'd save one life.

537
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:14,142
Isn't that worth it?

538
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:15,826
Anyway, Dr. Melendez won't let me

539
00:25:15,828 --> 00:25:17,394
ask for consent to test.

540
00:25:17,396 --> 00:25:20,264
What if I don't tell them
what I'm doing?

541
00:25:20,266 --> 00:25:22,500
A blatant ethics violation...
that's your solution?

542
00:25:22,502 --> 00:25:23,634
Yes.

543
00:25:23,636 --> 00:25:25,269
How do I do that?

544
00:25:30,076 --> 00:25:32,109
Well, uh,

545
00:25:32,111 --> 00:25:34,678
you do it and then don't tell anyone.

546
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,180
No one. If anyone asks...

547
00:25:36,182 --> 00:25:38,682
your attending noticed
a low RBC count...

548
00:25:38,684 --> 00:25:39,850
and needed to find the cause...

549
00:25:39,852 --> 00:25:42,520
that's it... no biggie.

550
00:25:43,523 --> 00:25:44,755
Hmm.

551
00:25:54,566 --> 00:25:57,768
You know Wilks'
Grocery on Santa Clara 17th?

552
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:00,905
It's been an institution
for nearly 60 years.

553
00:26:00,907 --> 00:26:04,008
My grandparents started it in 1958,

554
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:06,610
and my wife and I took it over in '82.

555
00:26:06,612 --> 00:26:07,945
But when my wife got sick

556
00:26:07,947 --> 00:26:10,147
and I started talking to Kevin
about taking it over,

557
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:12,783
he just... took off.

558
00:26:14,586 --> 00:26:15,920
To him, it was just a place

559
00:26:15,922 --> 00:26:18,022
to sell lettuce and toilet paper.

560
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:24,581
My father chairs a real-estate
development company in the U.K.

561
00:26:26,065 --> 00:26:27,364
Thought I'd be the perfect person

562
00:26:27,366 --> 00:26:29,033
to set up the U.S. office.

563
00:26:29,035 --> 00:26:31,468
You wanted to be in
the "helping profession," hmm?

564
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:34,205
I wanted to be in my profession.

565
00:26:34,207 --> 00:26:36,674
It's not about how small
or how big the venture is,

566
00:26:36,676 --> 00:26:38,576
it's about doing something that's yours.

567
00:26:41,646 --> 00:26:43,013
I guess.

568
00:26:49,387 --> 00:26:52,256
When he was little, we were inseparable.

569
00:26:54,827 --> 00:26:59,430
Ah, he used to love to
come to the store to "work."

570
00:27:02,401 --> 00:27:04,368
I even had a little apron
made for him...

571
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:06,559
had his name on it, too.

572
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:09,239
Still, you know, kids...

573
00:27:10,009 --> 00:27:11,350
grow up.

574
00:27:12,378 --> 00:27:15,498
I'm just grateful that
he stayed close to his mother.

575
00:27:16,292 --> 00:27:19,686
He could talk to her, tell her anything.

576
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,374
So could I.

577
00:27:23,656 --> 00:27:25,811
And when she went...

578
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,520
I lost them both.

579
00:27:34,242 --> 00:27:36,275
Looks like he's back now.

580
00:27:36,362 --> 00:27:39,904
All I know is he ditched me
when I needed him.

581
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:45,336
Well, you know,
as a wise person once said,

582
00:27:45,978 --> 00:27:48,430
"holding a grudge is a stone
in your heart."

583
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,820
What's that for?

584
00:27:56,822 --> 00:28:00,057
Local anaesthetic
for a bonemarrow aspiration.

585
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:02,794
Why do I need a bonemarrow aspiration?

586
00:28:03,796 --> 00:28:05,763
My attending saw a low RBC count

587
00:28:05,765 --> 00:28:08,197
and wants to find the cause...

588
00:28:08,434 --> 00:28:09,768
no biggie.

589
00:28:10,073 --> 00:28:11,372
"No biggie"?

590
00:28:11,437 --> 00:28:12,908
You're lying.

591
00:28:13,005 --> 00:28:14,985
What's going on?

592
00:28:15,074 --> 00:28:17,308
You already told me
I have terminal cancer,

593
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,876
what's worse than that?

594
00:28:24,015 --> 00:28:25,316
You might not.

595
00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:29,253
It might not be osteosarcoma...

596
00:28:29,255 --> 00:28:31,901
might be Langerhans cell histiocytosis,

597
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:33,682
which is treatable.

598
00:28:33,793 --> 00:28:34,815
Treatable?

599
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,009
As in, I might not die?

600
00:28:37,096 --> 00:28:38,696
That's why I need to aspirate...

601
00:28:38,698 --> 00:28:39,930
to find out for sure.

602
00:28:39,932 --> 00:28:41,532
Do my parents know?

603
00:28:41,534 --> 00:28:44,751
Mm...
I was told not to get their hopes up.

604
00:28:45,504 --> 00:28:48,961
Then let's do it before they get back.

605
00:28:49,675 --> 00:28:51,461
Roll onto your side.

606
00:29:01,969 --> 00:29:04,221
Is there a Scout badge for aspirations?

607
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:06,772
I think someone just made a joke.

608
00:29:10,474 --> 00:29:11,528
Hello.

609
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,397
What are you doing?
Painkiller.

610
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:15,716
My arm hurts.

611
00:29:15,981 --> 00:29:17,101
That wouldn't explain

612
00:29:17,103 --> 00:29:19,303
why I'd be injecting your lumbar region.

613
00:29:23,775 --> 00:29:25,442
Okay. Yes, hello.

614
00:29:25,444 --> 00:29:28,994
I think Evan may have been
misdiagnosed with cancer.

615
00:29:29,749 --> 00:29:32,883
I think he has something
that creates bone lesions

616
00:29:32,885 --> 00:29:34,351
that look like osteosarcoma.

617
00:29:34,353 --> 00:29:36,353
It's a small chance, 0.3%, but I...

618
00:29:36,355 --> 00:29:39,333
You... You told Evan that he has cancer?

619
00:29:40,126 --> 00:29:41,792
And now you are telling him... and us...

620
00:29:41,794 --> 00:29:42,726
that he doesn't?

621
00:29:42,728 --> 00:29:44,061
I'm telling you he might not.

622
00:29:44,063 --> 00:29:46,063
That's why I need
to perform this aspiration.

623
00:29:46,065 --> 00:29:48,032
He says whatever I have
might be treatable.

624
00:29:48,034 --> 00:29:50,200
Are you insane?
No. I am not insane.

625
00:29:50,202 --> 00:29:51,268
I thought you'd be happy.

626
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,636
There is a significant link between

627
00:29:52,638 --> 00:29:54,304
Langerhans cell histiocytosis and...

628
00:29:54,306 --> 00:29:56,206
Go! Get out!

629
00:29:58,401 --> 00:30:00,035
Let me get you some water.

630
00:30:05,461 --> 00:30:06,617
Oh, my God!
Hands right here...

631
00:30:06,619 --> 00:30:08,218
All right, buddy. Right here!

632
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:09,967
Respiratory, stat!

633
00:30:14,941 --> 00:30:16,774
He has a massive embolus,

634
00:30:16,776 --> 00:30:18,810
probably thrown from his fracture.

635
00:30:18,812 --> 00:30:20,345
It's located at the bifurcation

636
00:30:20,347 --> 00:30:21,880
of the pulmonary arteries.

637
00:30:21,882 --> 00:30:23,414
He's close to hemodynamic collapse.

638
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:24,682
Yeah, no kidding.

639
00:30:24,684 --> 00:30:26,284
I'd like to assist.

640
00:30:26,286 --> 00:30:27,585
Not a chance.

641
00:30:27,587 --> 00:30:29,998
Okay. I'd like to assist.

642
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,056
You're obviously too close to the case.

643
00:30:32,058 --> 00:30:34,259
I think I'm just
the right amount of close.

644
00:30:34,261 --> 00:30:35,760
Murphy, you lied to the parents

645
00:30:35,762 --> 00:30:37,629
just so you could try to
prove your ridiculous theory.

646
00:30:37,631 --> 00:30:39,406
You're too damn close.

647
00:30:41,313 --> 00:30:42,979
Saddle embolism, scrub in.

648
00:30:50,477 --> 00:30:52,277
We have to get rid of
the embolus before he arrests.

649
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:54,066
His heart is barely pumping blood.

650
00:30:54,091 --> 00:30:55,559
I can feel the pulmonary artery...

651
00:30:55,584 --> 00:30:57,914
I just need to find the obstruction...
there!

652
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:58,917
I got it.

653
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:00,351
Knife.
Knife.

654
00:31:00,353 --> 00:31:01,819
EKG is showing right heart strain.

655
00:31:01,821 --> 00:31:02,921
He can't take this much longer.

656
00:31:02,923 --> 00:31:04,598
I know, but if I move any quicker,

657
00:31:04,623 --> 00:31:07,025
I could nick the left main artery
and kill the boy.

658
00:31:12,199 --> 00:31:14,666
The phrase "no biggie" gave me away.

659
00:31:14,668 --> 00:31:16,768
You really got to learn how to lie,
Shaun.

660
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:20,246
Am I in trouble?

661
00:31:20,373 --> 00:31:21,805
Yes.

662
00:31:22,909 --> 00:31:24,924
Unless you're right.

663
00:31:25,078 --> 00:31:26,945
If I'm wrong, they shouldn't be upset.

664
00:31:26,947 --> 00:31:29,221
They know it's highly unlikely.

665
00:31:31,284 --> 00:31:33,338
False hope, Shaun...

666
00:31:33,553 --> 00:31:35,376
it's just plain cruel.

667
00:31:51,605 --> 00:31:53,507
Hey.

668
00:31:54,007 --> 00:31:56,140
He talk to you?

669
00:31:56,818 --> 00:31:58,685
Did you talk to him?

670
00:31:58,812 --> 00:32:00,445
I don't know what to tell him.

671
00:32:05,755 --> 00:32:07,389
You love your father, don't you?

672
00:32:07,454 --> 00:32:08,886
Yeah, of course.

673
00:32:08,888 --> 00:32:11,155
Right. Well,
he's about to go in for brain surgery.

674
00:32:11,157 --> 00:32:13,150
There's huge risks involved.

675
00:32:13,203 --> 00:32:14,369
Whatever this lie is,

676
00:32:14,394 --> 00:32:15,493
can you live the rest of your life

677
00:32:15,495 --> 00:32:17,061
knowing you kept it from him?

678
00:32:29,675 --> 00:32:32,314
My... My girlfriend wasn't sick.

679
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,345
Okay? She dumped me.

680
00:32:35,515 --> 00:32:36,881
She's married with two kids...

681
00:32:36,883 --> 00:32:39,009
had no intention of leaving them.

682
00:32:39,352 --> 00:32:40,518
I-I was an idiot.

683
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,002
You got your heart broken,
that's the problem here?

684
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:44,794
No... no, Dad.

685
00:32:44,858 --> 00:32:45,938
The problem is...

686
00:32:46,993 --> 00:32:48,359
I didn't run away to Thailand

687
00:32:48,361 --> 00:32:51,954
because I thought Wilks'
Grocery was beneath me.

688
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:55,767
I was afraid that I would never be able

689
00:32:55,769 --> 00:32:57,876
to fill your shoes...

690
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:01,831
And then I proved myself right.

691
00:33:18,058 --> 00:33:19,991
Left pulmonary artery's open.

692
00:33:19,993 --> 00:33:21,125
Ring Forceps.

693
00:33:23,289 --> 00:33:25,130
Ring Forceps.

694
00:33:27,554 --> 00:33:28,833
Come on.

695
00:33:31,603 --> 00:33:32,904
Got it.

696
00:33:36,242 --> 00:33:38,076
EKG is normalizing.

697
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:40,378
He's okay. Nice job.

698
00:33:40,403 --> 00:33:42,479
All right,
flush the left pulmonary artery

699
00:33:42,538 --> 00:33:44,510
and close him up.
Okay.

700
00:33:50,857 --> 00:33:53,620
Um... Dr. Melendez...

701
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,493
Take a look at this.

702
00:34:23,622 --> 00:34:26,769
Recycling... Shaun, very responsible.

703
00:34:27,861 --> 00:34:29,480
It's a book.

704
00:34:30,163 --> 00:34:31,462
I appreciate that.

705
00:34:41,641 --> 00:34:42,974
Thanks, Shaun.

706
00:34:48,284 --> 00:34:49,339
Hey.

707
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:57,089
We got the embolism.

708
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,909
He's in recovery and he's doing fine.

709
00:35:00,761 --> 00:35:02,260
But while we were in there,

710
00:35:02,262 --> 00:35:04,162
we did find something else.

711
00:35:04,164 --> 00:35:05,963
Lesions on his ribs.

712
00:35:09,334 --> 00:35:11,891
Irrefutable proof of osteosarcoma.

713
00:35:12,539 --> 00:35:14,806
It's metastasized to his chest cavity.

714
00:35:17,309 --> 00:35:19,177
I'm sorry.

715
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,750
I'm very sorry.

716
00:35:49,418 --> 00:35:52,488
Give that a nice, warm saline bath.

717
00:35:53,936 --> 00:35:55,828
Forceps and Taylor scissors, please.

718
00:35:55,852 --> 00:35:58,066
Forceps and scissors.
Thank you.

719
00:36:07,611 --> 00:36:08,843
Look at that.

720
00:36:08,845 --> 00:36:10,771
That's what built the pyramids,

721
00:36:11,138 --> 00:36:13,146
painted the Mona Lisa,

722
00:36:13,717 --> 00:36:16,325
invented the Internet.

723
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:20,772
And there is our interloper.

724
00:36:20,853 --> 00:36:22,987
Squeezeball please, Deidre.

725
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,159
Squeezeball?

726
00:36:24,161 --> 00:36:26,258
His name for it, not ours.

727
00:36:26,363 --> 00:36:30,123
The saline gently displaces the cyst

728
00:36:30,577 --> 00:36:32,878
and coaxes it out of
its little hiding place...

729
00:36:32,903 --> 00:36:37,318
Hopefully in one piece
so we don't have to call 911.

730
00:36:38,231 --> 00:36:40,029
Come on, now...

731
00:36:40,277 --> 00:36:42,318
Tray, please.

732
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,100
There we go...

733
00:36:44,181 --> 00:36:46,076
And...

734
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,498
And you got it.

735
00:36:48,819 --> 00:36:50,185
Got it.

736
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:53,021
He has his father's eyes.

737
00:36:53,023 --> 00:36:54,723
That was incredible.

738
00:36:54,725 --> 00:36:56,681
One down, three to go...

739
00:37:09,006 --> 00:37:11,506
Hey. There he is.

740
00:37:11,508 --> 00:37:12,731
Hi, Sweetie.

741
00:37:14,193 --> 00:37:15,826
What's the matter?

742
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:16,941
Nothing.

743
00:37:17,014 --> 00:37:20,239
We're just happy you did so great.

744
00:37:22,151 --> 00:37:24,255
You had what's called an embolism.

745
00:37:24,921 --> 00:37:27,059
It clogged an artery in your lungs.

746
00:37:27,324 --> 00:37:29,356
But the good news is they got it.

747
00:37:29,826 --> 00:37:32,317
And you're gonna be just fine.

748
00:37:32,662 --> 00:37:33,762
Still...

749
00:37:33,764 --> 00:37:35,884
too bad about the cancer, huh?

750
00:37:35,909 --> 00:37:37,118
No, no, no, no.

751
00:37:37,143 --> 00:37:39,134
The doctor did not know
what he was talking about...

752
00:37:39,136 --> 00:37:41,036
Dad, I know all about it.

753
00:37:41,038 --> 00:37:43,510
I have for a long time.

754
00:37:45,443 --> 00:37:46,900
Well, I...

755
00:37:50,146 --> 00:37:52,649
I am so sorry.

756
00:37:52,749 --> 00:37:54,493
It's okay.

757
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:10,698
Because I'm not gonna be alone.

758
00:38:12,268 --> 00:38:14,345
Grandma's gonna be there, too.

759
00:38:15,539 --> 00:38:17,540
Auntie Arlene.

760
00:38:19,319 --> 00:38:22,587
Uncle Jim,
if he figured out how to stop swearing.

761
00:38:29,086 --> 00:38:30,718
I'll get you some water, buddy.

762
00:38:41,598 --> 00:38:43,949
So, I took Penny for a walk...

763
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,433
just around the block.

764
00:38:47,803 --> 00:38:50,572
And I picked her up some of
those rawhide treats,

765
00:38:50,574 --> 00:38:52,503
you know...

766
00:38:53,743 --> 00:38:55,844
the ones that Mom used to
like to give to her.

767
00:39:02,151 --> 00:39:03,973
I miss her, Dad.

768
00:39:33,383 --> 00:39:34,816
Coast is clear?

769
00:39:41,091 --> 00:39:42,090
Yes.

770
00:39:42,092 --> 00:39:43,874
Thank you.

771
00:39:44,026 --> 00:39:45,659
Mm, I was wrong.

772
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:47,014
You tried.

773
00:39:47,063 --> 00:39:48,463
I was wrong.

774
00:39:50,266 --> 00:39:51,693
Your parents hate me.

775
00:39:51,718 --> 00:39:52,767
I know.

776
00:39:52,769 --> 00:39:55,069
I gave you false hope.
Yeah.

777
00:39:55,071 --> 00:39:57,772
But for a minute there,
it was pretty awesome.

778
00:40:00,809 --> 00:40:02,844
I'm going to ask you for a favor.

779
00:40:05,347 --> 00:40:08,035
Well,
I'm not giving away my Make-A-Wish.

780
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:10,550
Mm,
would you mind if I read you something?

781
00:40:10,654 --> 00:40:12,407
It's not long.

782
00:40:12,522 --> 00:40:14,298
That I can do.

783
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,821
"Atticus was right.

784
00:40:26,603 --> 00:40:29,170
"One time he said
you never really know a man

785
00:40:29,235 --> 00:40:32,578
"until you stand in his shoes
and walk around in them.

786
00:40:32,776 --> 00:40:35,492
"Just standing
on the Radley porch was enough.

787
00:40:35,545 --> 00:40:36,945
"The streetlights were fuzzy

788
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,913
"from the fine rain that was falling.

789
00:40:38,968 --> 00:40:42,006
"As I made my way home,
I felt very old."

790
00:40:43,053 --> 00:40:50,177
I can't protect you
from the course of life

791
00:40:51,528 --> 00:40:58,477
But you know me
and you know I was born to try

792
00:40:58,935 --> 00:41:04,260
It's just the symptom
of a middle-aged attack

793
00:41:04,285 --> 00:41:06,777
"... while he hadn't done
any of those things,

794
00:41:06,878 --> 00:41:09,563
"Atticus, he was real nice.

795
00:41:09,946 --> 00:41:11,312
"His hands were under my chin,

796
00:41:11,314 --> 00:41:12,614
"pulling up the cover,

797
00:41:12,616 --> 00:41:14,842
"tucking it around me.

798
00:41:14,918 --> 00:41:17,772
"Most people are, Scout,
when you finally see them."

799
00:41:18,255 --> 00:41:21,506
"He turned out the light
and went into Jem's room.

800
00:41:21,558 --> 00:41:23,251
"He would be there all night,

801
00:41:23,293 --> 00:41:26,808
"and he would be there when Jem
waked up in the morning."

802
00:41:31,801 --> 00:41:33,876
Sounds like a good book.

803
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,449
Could've used a spoiler alert, though.

804
00:41:43,146 --> 00:41:45,039
Thank you.

805
00:41:45,148 --> 00:41:49,378
Confusing you,
from what you need

806
00:41:49,418 --> 00:41:53,319
Every hand that you hold

807
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:54,936
It comes back

808
00:41:54,986 --> 00:41:57,320
That's all.

809
00:41:57,416 --> 00:42:01,229
Every word, every ride

810
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:05,820
It comes back every time

811
00:42:09,394 --> 00:42:13,755
It comes back every time

812
00:42:19,294 --> 00:42:20,600
Every time
