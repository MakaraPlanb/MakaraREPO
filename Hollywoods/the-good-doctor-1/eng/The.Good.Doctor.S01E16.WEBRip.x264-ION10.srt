My neighbor Kenny and his
girlfriend go all the time.

2
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:09,114
The rides were actually fun,
Claire,

3
00:00:09,177 --> 00:00:11,407
even though they hurl you
through the air very quickly

4
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:13,909
without a proper
three-point seat belt.

5
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:16,381
It was worth
the $300 I spent.

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,090
What kind of carnival
will cost you that
much money?

7
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:20,392
It was not
just the carnival.

8
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:23,394
Kenny's girlfriend wanted to
go to see a movie afterwards,

9
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:25,387
but I just got
the second edition

10
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:27,529
of Chaikof's
Atlas of Vascular Therapy

11
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:29,055
so decided not to go.

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,160
And you paid
for everyone?

13
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:31,531
I had to.
I lost the bet.

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,239
Rounds will have to wait.
We have a consult come up.

Hunter Denoble, 38.

16
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:38,069
Came into the E.R.
this morning complaining
of severe neck pain.

17
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:40,009
X-rays
show anterolisthesis.

18
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:42,244
A herniated disc.
Thirty-eight a little young
for that, isn't it?

19
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,810
Unless there's a history
of spinal trauma.

20
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,108
There is.

21
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,320
Hunter fractured
seven vertebrae
in his neck and back

22
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,152
in a motorcycle accident
10 years ago.

23
00:00:50,218 --> 00:00:51,748
He was one of
my first patients.

24
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:54,359
Suffered complete paralysis
from the chest down.

25
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:56,962
...a few months back,
just gnawing pain.

26
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:58,994
Ibuprofen usually
took the edge off.

27
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,589
Every day?

28
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:03,501
Uh, yeah, give or take.

29
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:06,104
It's not that bad.
Last night
things changed.

30
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:07,267
He couldn't move
his neck at all,

31
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:09,335
and the pain medicine
had no effect.

32
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:12,373
So, he wanted to tough it out,
but I dragged him in here.

33
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,670
Yeah, it sounds like you.

34
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:14,941

35
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,008
Yeah.

36
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,306
And that?
Mmm-hmm.

37
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:19,108
I made partner
at the firm.

38
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,250
I don't like
to call in sick.

39
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:25,145
And let's face it, I've spent
enough nights in hospital
rooms for five lifetimes.

40
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:27,359
Can't argue with that.
Squeeze my hands.

41
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:32,387
You have any tingling
or weakness in your arms?

42
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,960
No.

43
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,797
The plain films showed
what looked like
a herniated disc.

44
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:39,404
Which would mean...?

45
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:41,197
Artificial
disc replacement.

46
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:45,109
Day procedure, he'd be out
by the morning at the latest.

47
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:47,183
You married him?

48
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:52,483
Yes, three years ago
in Cancun.
It was lovely.

49
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:55,146
Even though
he's in a wheelchair?

HUNTER: Oh, no worries.

00:01:56,484 --> 00:01:58,494
I get this all the time.

Yeah.

But I haven't
seen you in years.

Don't run away from me.

Can we talk?
Since I don't
want to see you,

75
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:16,461
it follows that I don't want
to hear from you, either.

Sorry, it's not fine.

is definitely infected.

Just that one, though,
right?

00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,510
Yes. At this point,

lipo, and breast augmentation

85
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:40,886
But I need to remove
this one and clean the area

86
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:41,994
before
the bacteria spreads.

87
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,785
Well,
can you replace it?

88
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:45,457
Once the infection
is resolved

89
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:47,026
and you have
a few months to heal.

around with half
of a face for a few months.

you can do
to save the implant?

I can't make
any guarantees,

93
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:56,571
but if I can replace
the implant without
risking re-infection, I will.

Okay, Doctor.

I babysat the kids

like a lot of my friends had,

107
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:48,358
so I saved up 1,000 bucks.

I came home one day,

109
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,360
and the money was gone
and so was my mother.

110
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:56,397
And three days later,

00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:58,834
she came back from Reno

and a guy named Ricky.

145
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,230
it can start to
function again.

146

So, this mass

Yes.

If the cord is healthy,

149

why aren't I feeling
more than pain?

150
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,039
The mass is compressing
the healthy cord,

151
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,478
just letting the pain
through.

152
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,183
We still have to do

153

some more advanced imaging
to map the mass,

154
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,617
but I am fairly confident

155
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:57,253
that if we removed it
that could change.

156
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,563
You may be able
to walk again.

Oh, no.

you'll be a very good dancer.

You know what
the worst part is?

192
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,145
It isn't
being in the chair.

193
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,583
It's that people
see the chair first.

When you first
started working here,

200
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,399
no one believed in you.
They didn't know me.

201
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,904
They didn't know that I was
going to make a good surgeon.

they're competent.

00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,896
It pays to be thorough.

00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:30,767

Maybe a little.

What's wrong?

217
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,478
It could be nothing,

218
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:39,353
or it could be a carbuncle,
an early sign of infection.

219
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,052
Dr. Andrews needs
to have a look at this.

220
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:50,855
This varicocele is raising
testicular temperature

221
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,034
and causing your sperm count
to be low.

222
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:56,103
Surgically, I go in,
ligate the varicocele

223
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:57,873
and re-check your numbers
in a few weeks.

224
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,101
It's done under a local,

225
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:02,136
so no anesthesia risks,
minimal blood loss.

226
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:04,172
There's a risk of
low testosterone
and impotence,

227
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:06,467
but recovery time's
usually a week at most.

228
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,953
So, I could have kids,
I just might not be able
to make them?

229
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:14,883
As I said,
it's low risk.

I'm obligated to inform you.

Well, you're obligated to
inform me because it's a risk.

232
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:22,693
It's an unlikely complication,
but, yes, it happens.

is a chance to fix a problem.

236
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,900

to create a new one.

Look, I see a lot of men
with this issue.

242
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,711
Sure, they come in
because they want kids,

243
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:46,407
but I think what
they really want is
to reaffirm themselves.

It's a spinal
arachnoid meningioma.

247
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:59,858
Have you seen
one of these before?

248
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:01,087
DR. MELENDEZ: Much smaller.

249
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,731
They usually
don't get this big

250
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:06,196
because the pain and weakness
brings the patient
into the E.R. fast.

251
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:07,866
But in this case,
no pain,

252
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:09,895
no E.R. visit
until it got this big.

253
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,370
And it's wrapped around
the spinal cord tightly
and fused with the dura.

254
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:14,909
Can we get a fiber-optic laser
and take it out in segments?

255
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:18,609
No, I don't think so.

256
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:22,478
It stopped growing
and settled in this position.

257
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:25,849
But I do think
that we can dissect along
the subarachnoid plane

258
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,549
down to the largest
segment at T2

259
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,790
and remove it
in one piece.

260
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,956
That's an extension
of the mass.

261
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,794
Mmm, no.
It's the medullary pyramids.

262
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:37,431
No.
It's an extension of the mass.

263
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:41,667
The pyramids are more central
and the color is wrong.

264
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,299
Murphy's right.

265
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,211

would have missed this.

It's very small
on the surface,

271
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:01,051
but I can feel the fluctuance
under the skin.

Let's just do the same
with the rest of 'em.

00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:24,643
It's not that simple.

283
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:26,811
When we removed the infection
from Emma's cheek,

284
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,780
it was under the pretense
it was a localized issue.

285
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,290
If we just take out
the infection from
the new area,

286
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:33,552
it could jump again.

287
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:37,829
I won't do it.

288
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:40,361
When an infection spreads,
it often moves very quickly.

289
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,687
What Dr. Andrews
is saying...

290
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,231

what he's saying.

I'm 50 years old.

00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:51,908
When I went
to drop my daughter
off at Michigan,

00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:55,042
we went to that bar

where we first met.

295
00:12:56,877 --> 00:13:00,107
I saw myself sitting there

young, confident,
full of potential.

297
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,749
Then you raise a kid

298
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:11,661
and look after
your husband,

299
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:14,126

You lose touch
with who you were.

You... You said it was
an infection, right?

302

That's what

Couldn't we just
use that?

We could try strong,
broad-spectrum antibiotics,

306
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,222
but I really don't
want to do that.

307
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:42,558
You could become septic.

308
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:44,162

The brainstem is complex.

Even our best imaging can't
provide a complete picture.

it's not harming Hunter.

But what about
the pain?

An implanted nerve inhibitor
will completely remove the
pain.

It wasn't when Dr. Melendez
told me after the accident.

It was a few months later
when I was in rehab

338
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:19,652

get up in the standing frame.

I looked out the window
and there's all these people

living again.

something I can do.

that lost their way.

697
00:36:54,513 --> 00:36:56,283
They loved each other,

698
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:01,047
but by the time
they remembered
what really mattered,

699
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,389
it was too late.

700
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:10,128
I don't want us
to be like them.

701
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:13,225
I want to be
fully committed to you.

702
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:17,167
I love you, too.

703
00:37:19,438 --> 00:37:20,868
(CHUCKLES)

704
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:28,854
There's a surgery I could have
that should make me fertile,

705
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:30,724
but there's a risk
of impotency.

706
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,720
What do you want to do?

707
00:37:36,788 --> 00:37:38,088
I want to give you
what you want,

708
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:39,426
what we want,
a family.

709
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:42,862
We are a family.

710
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:46,132
Yes, I want children,

711
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:48,297
and there are many ways
to do that,

712
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:50,997
which we'll explore
together.

713
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:54,069
But I draw the line
at anything
that risks our sex life.

714
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,740

715
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,686
It's just
one night a week,

716
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:09,562
but I think this could be
my big break, you know?

717
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:10,961
Well, you always had
a beautiful voice.

718
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:15,033
Well, everyone's
got one thing, right?

719
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:17,433
But enough about me.
I want to hear about you.

720
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,466
Do you have a man?

721
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:22,171
I did.

722
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:26,003
Pretty young thing
should have plenty of choices.

723
00:38:26,071 --> 00:38:27,941
Hmm, I'm not looking to
complicate my life right now.

724
00:38:28,774 --> 00:38:30,014
Hmm.

725
00:38:30,075 --> 00:38:33,745
Still looking after
everyone else but yourself,

726
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,552
like you did for me.

727
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:40,589
* Set your dreams
where nobody hides

728
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:43,022
You know,
I know brag to everyone.

729
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:44,888
"My baby.
She's a surgeon."

730
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:46,686
Surgical resident.

731
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:47,828
Right, sorry.

732
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:50,404
You like it?

733
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:54,774
I love it.

734
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:58,173
* Give your tears to the tide

735
00:38:58,236 --> 00:39:00,506
Where are you staying?
You're...
Are you in town for a while?

736
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:02,512
Yeah.

737
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:04,114
I'd like
to be closer to you.

738
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,453
**

739
00:39:08,614 --> 00:39:10,624
I found a place.

740
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:13,593
You'd like it,

741
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:17,192
but I just need to put up
first and last.

742
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:19,425
* No time

743
00:39:20,626 --> 00:39:21,886
I'll pay you back.

744
00:39:22,728 --> 00:39:24,958
**

745
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:28,565
How much do you need?

746
00:39:28,634 --> 00:39:30,544
$2,500.

747
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:33,542
Plus I have to get furniture
and, you know, all of that.

748
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:35,365
I thought maybe you could
help me pick that stuff out.

749
00:39:35,441 --> 00:39:36,681
You've always been
so good at that.

750
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:38,442
I really appreciate it.
I'm good for it.

751
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:41,714

* Set your dreams

755
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,708
KENNY:
Uh, Celeste isn't coming.
She broke up with me.

756
00:40:12,778 --> 00:40:15,148
I hate her.

757
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:18,523
But I'm not gonna let that
ruin our night.

758
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:19,894
That's what friends are for.

759
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:22,491
They got each other's backs,
rain or shine.

760
00:40:22,554 --> 00:40:25,764
By the by, I found a $20
in your battery drawer,

761
00:40:25,824 --> 00:40:27,434
so I got us
Chinese food.

762
00:40:27,493 --> 00:40:30,503
Don't thank me.
I don't like Chinese food.

763
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:31,832
Aw, come on now.

764
00:40:31,897 --> 00:40:34,597
Trust me, everybody likes
Ma Jong's Kung Pao.

* Set your dreams

766
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:40,867
There you go.

767
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:44,039
I'm pretty torn up
about that Celeste thing.
She was a real keeper.

768
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:46,009
You said
you hated Celeste.

769
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:47,707
I do.
I... I hate her 'cause...

770
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,719
I don't know...
I kind of love her.

771
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:52,476
This tastes terrible.

772
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:55,251
Okay,
then he hates Chinese food.

773
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,020
More for me.

774
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,318
Plain white rice?

775
00:40:59,725 --> 00:41:01,785
* No time

776
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,500
Oh, uh,
I got a gaming console,

777
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:05,402
and I hooked it up to
your bad boy over there.

778
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,873
We can play some
Mortal Kombat.

780
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:10,244

00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:26,283
Yeah, there you go.

786
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:27,721
This one's you.

787
00:41:29,955 --> 00:41:32,355
That's you on the left
right there.

788
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:34,233
Okay.
Yeah.

789
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:37,932
You got four arms,
but you're naked,
so here we go.

790
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:40,366
SHAUN: I gave you
a pneumothorax.

791
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,301
KENNY: Ah, I didn't
realize how bloody
this game was.

792
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:43,897
Ooh, a fireball.
I got you there.

793
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:46,443
Have you played
this before?

794
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,744
SHAUN: That looks like
a spinal fracture.

795
00:41:49,808 --> 00:41:51,878
KENNY: Yeah, I'd say...
I'd say there's
a huge fracture there.

796
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:53,143
SHAUN: You died.
