in front of my eyes.

720
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:24,803
I couldn't save them.

721
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:28,936
It's sad.

722
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:33,884
Neither one had the chance
to become an adult.

723
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:39,722
They should have become adults.

724
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:42,791
They should have had
children of their own

725
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:46,961
and loved those children.

726
00:38:50,962 --> 00:38:53,672
And I want
to make that possible

727
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:56,869
for other people.

728
00:38:56,902 --> 00:39:06,112
**

729
00:39:06,144 --> 00:39:08,154
And I want to make
a lot of money

730
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:12,719
so that I can have a television.

731
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:21,591
**

732
00:39:21,627 --> 00:39:26,827
Dr. Murphy...

733
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,995
I want to be the first
to welcome you

734
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:33,405
to San Jose
St. Bonaventure Hospital.

735
00:39:33,439 --> 00:39:36,069
**

736
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:38,477
We're very proud to have you.

737
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:42,150
[ Applause ]

738
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:48,190
**

739
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:53,759
Shaun, Dr. Melendez's
team is going into surgery.

740
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:56,632
I mean,
if you're interested.

741
00:40:01,467 --> 00:40:10,807
**

742
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:20,152
**

743
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:29,695
**

744
00:40:29,728 --> 00:40:39,068
**

745
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:48,654
**

746
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:57,990
**

747
00:40:58,023 --> 00:41:01,093
Got a messy
field here.

748
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:03,526
Murphy.

749
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:10,902
**

750
00:41:10,936 --> 00:41:13,636
Shaun: Suction.

751
00:41:13,672 --> 00:41:19,112
**

752
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:22,054
Never forget,
you're the smart one.

753
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,180
You can do anything.

754
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:27,585
And I'm proud
of you, Shaun.

755
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:33,529
**

756
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:35,559
Bet you've seen
many of these.

757
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:40,699
I remember my first.

758
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:44,972
Kept thinking, "It doesn't get
any better than this."

759
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:48,573
And for you, I'm afraid,
that's literally true.

760
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:54,579
You're a nice kid,
and you're obviously very smart,

761
00:41:54,613 --> 00:41:57,683
but you don't belong here.

762
00:41:57,716 --> 00:41:59,646
So, as long as you're
part of my team,

763
00:41:59,685 --> 00:42:03,915
this is all you're ever
going to be doing -- suction.

764
00:42:07,726 --> 00:42:12,196
I saw a lot of surgeons
in medical school.

765
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,200
You're much better
than them.

766
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:16,772
I have a lot
to learn from you.

767
00:42:16,802 --> 00:42:23,042
**

768
00:42:23,074 --> 00:42:26,244
You're very arrogant.

769
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:30,277
Do you think that helps you
be a good surgeon?

770
00:42:30,315 --> 00:42:34,215
Does it hurt you
as a person?

771
00:42:34,252 --> 00:42:36,922
Is it worth it?

772
00:42:36,955 --> 00:42:43,125
**

773
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:57,309
**

774
00:42:57,342 --> 00:43:06,922
**

775
00:43:06,952 --> 00:43:16,292
**
