1
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:05,106
Autism... a mental condition

2
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:08,109
characterized by
difficulty in communicating.

3
00:00:08,142 --> 00:00:10,778
Does it sound like
I'm describing a surgeon?

4
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:11,745
You saved his life.

5
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:13,247
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

6
00:00:13,281 --> 00:00:14,782
Never forget, you're the smart one

7
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:16,350
and I'm proud of you, Shaun.

8
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,352
My brother went to Heaven...

9
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:21,355
Aah!

10
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:22,690
in front of my eyes.

11
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:25,193
He's got a serious deficit.

12
00:00:25,226 --> 00:00:26,194
We hire Shaun,

13
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:28,229
and we give hope to those people
with limitations

14
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:29,530
that those limitations

15
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:31,665
are not what they think they are,

16
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,601
that they do have a shot!

17
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:38,072
If Shaun doesn't live up
to everything I know he can do,

18
00:00:38,106 --> 00:00:41,442
I will resign my position
as president of this hospital.

19
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:02,623
Where to?

20
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,892
San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital.

21
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,594
I'm a surgical resident.

22
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,396
Today is my first full day.

23
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:09,897
I meant floor.

24
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,299
Oh, ground floor.

25
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:14,768
I'm taking the bus.

26
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,917
This is Mitchell Brand, 55 years old,

27
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,253
post-op day one
from a radical prostatectomy.

28
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:33,254
Morning, Mitchell.

29
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:34,222
I'm Dr. Melendez.

30
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:36,690
These are my residents
Dr. Browne and Dr. Kalu.

31
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:38,226
Your surgery went perfectly.

32
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:38,959
Yeah.

33
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,462
Am I ever gonna walk again?

34
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,631
Yes. Of course.

35
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:44,765
This is Mitchell Brand.

36
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:45,799
I reviewed his chart.

37
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,868
He's 55 years old from Chicago,

38
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,403
divorced with two children.

39
00:02:49,437 --> 00:02:51,805
You did a radical prostatectomy
on him yesterday.

40
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,407
There are many possible complications

41
00:02:53,441 --> 00:02:54,775
but none related to motor neurons.

42
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:56,944
There is no chance
you won't be able to walk.

43
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,616
He... he wasn't worried about his legs.

44
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,620
Oh, yes.

45
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:09,890
There's a significant chance
of impotence.

46
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,792
Dr. Murphy, you're late.

47
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:12,893
No, the bus was late.

48
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,295
The schedule was clear.

49
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:15,162
They post it online.

50
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,398
But the 4 bus was late which meant...

51
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:18,699
You're late.
Five minutes, we've all been...

52
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:19,833
On your first day, no less.

53
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,469
It is your responsibility to be here.

54
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:22,370
if you are not,

55
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:23,971
you have failed in your responsibility,

56
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,306
which makes it your fault.

57
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:26,707
Okay, how can it be my fault?

58
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,442
I did nothing wrong. The bus...

59
00:03:28,476 --> 00:03:29,810
Yeah. This is gonna work out great.

60
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,845
The board clearly made
the right choice in hiring you.

61
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,414
Thank you.

62
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:35,383
Dr. Melendez,

63
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,718
we've got an emergent consult
in the E.R.

64
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:38,686
You should be fine

65
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,322
if you can leave it alone
for a couple days.

66
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,991
Four days of indigestion,

67
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,893
bloating, constipation, and nausea.

68
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:46,794
Ugh.

69
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,629
And a lot of pain, apparently.

70
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,732
Did you give her morphine?
Yeah, 10 milligrams.

71
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:52,800
Hasn't touched her pain.

72
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:55,469
You have time to get a CT?

73
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:57,338
Yeah. That's why I called you.

74
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:03,644
That's very big.

75
00:04:05,313 --> 00:04:06,414
Yes, it is.

76
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:08,282
What are we looking at?

77
00:04:08,316 --> 00:04:10,618
It's definitely abutting
the aorta and the left kidney.

78
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,953
Renal angiomyolipoma?

79
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:15,889
Do you see an extensive blood supply?
No.

80
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:18,492
Maybe some kind of neurogenic tumor.

81
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:19,760
Or maybe a lymphoma.

82
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:22,496
She has a sarcoma, a malignant tumor.

83
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:24,865
Malignant?

84
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:26,900
That means it's killing me, right? Yes.

85
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:27,668
Not necessarily.

86
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:28,902
We're just speculating right now.

87
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,638
No. It's definitely malignant.

88
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:31,905
If it weren't malignant...

89
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,507
Please stop saying "malignant."

90
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:34,442
Should we talk outside?

91
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,913
Give her more morphine.
As much as she wants.

92
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,520
You scared her.

93
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:47,655
Didn't need to be so blunt.

94
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:48,689
Why?

95
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:51,559
Her prognosis is terminal

96
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:53,527
without immediate medical intervention.

97
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:54,395
Isn't that scary?

98
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:57,331
Well...

99
00:04:57,365 --> 00:04:58,932
That fear does her no good.

100
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:02,770
Does she have a malignant sarcoma?

101
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,373
Are we gonna be doing a laparotomy?

102
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,942
We need intra-operative staging
for the biopsy,

103
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:11,011
extensive dissection
of the retroperitoneum,

104
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,581
and excision of the mass with wide,
clear margins.

105
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:15,749
I want in.

106
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:16,650
You do know you're drooling, right?

107
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:19,019
About cutting open a 40-year-old woman.

108
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,954
Real person. Right behind that door.

109
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:21,889
It's called bedside manner...

110
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:23,491
no such thing as
outside-the-door manner.

111
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:25,526
It is exciting, Claire.

112
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,495
We'd be saving a life,
and we'd be learning.

113
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:28,896
See?

114
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,764
Dr. Browne, you're my number two.

115
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,100
With all due respect, doctor...

116
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,402
Comments that start that way

117
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:35,636
rarely come across that way.

118
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,839
I was going to say that's an
excellent call. Thank you.

119
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,741
Jared, prep the surgical team.

120
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:41,675
Sir, what do I do?

121
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:45,813
Scut work.

122
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:46,814
What's scut work?

123
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,549
Today, I'm gonna need my surgeons

124
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:49,683
to have no distractions.

125
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:52,686
So I'm gonna need you
to handle those distractions.

126
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,588
All the work they do every day

127
00:05:54,622 --> 00:05:55,756
that they hate doing,

128
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:57,725
you're handling it for them.

129
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,570
Make sure they know we still
need a consent on that one.

130
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:16,744
Am I being punished for something?

131
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:18,612
No.

132
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:20,648
Okay.

133
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:22,750
So that's it?

134
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:25,619
You just accept my answer at face value?

135
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:27,054
Why?

136
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:29,490
You're very arrogant.

137
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:32,593
Arrogant people don't think
they need to lie.

138
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:34,862
So you must be doing this to teach me.

139
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,498
I look forward to learning
from scut work.

140
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,205
Say "Ahh." Ahhh.

141
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,674
How long will this be?

142
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:49,042
Seven minutes.

143
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,511
Without any complications,

144
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:51,645
it takes seven minutes

145
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:53,681
to do a discharge examination properly.

146
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:55,549
Dr. Dunsmuir
has already cleared him to go

147
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,184
and we need the bed. Okay.

148
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:59,953
Protocol requires that
the surgical department

149
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:01,054
also clears him.

150
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:05,593
You have an ear infection.

151
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:06,894
Yes, that's why he's here.

152
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,596
My hearing's been a little muffled,

153
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:09,997
and I've had some ringing.

154
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,699
They gave him amoxicillin.

155
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:13,000
And we're sending him home.

156
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,535
Which is why you're here.

157
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:16,637
To send him home.

158
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,571
I'd like an MRI

159
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:19,540
of the head
and internal auditory meatus.

160
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:20,874
I'm not being discharged?

161
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:22,476
What do you think is wrong?

162
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,980
I'll tell you when I know for sure.

163
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:28,782
I don't want to scare you.

164
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:41,862
Shaun.

165
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,130
What are you doing down here?

166
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,599
I'm waiting for her to fart.

167
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,036
Flatulence.

168
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:51,705
But I'm using the word "fart"
in front of the patient

169
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:52,606
to be more casual.

170
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,074
But you're the president
of the hospital,

171
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,175
so I'll say "flatulence" to you.

172
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:57,778
Well, I appreciate that.

173
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,680
Why are you doing that?

174
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:01,214
She had her deviated septum repaired.

175
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:02,550
Before we can release her,

176
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,117
we have to be sure she isn't suffering

177
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,519
from post-operative ileus.

178
00:08:05,553 --> 00:08:07,220
Ah.

179
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,858
This is what Dr. Melendez feels

180
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:13,226
you'll be most useful doing today?

181
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,062
Waiting for farts?

182
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,664
I'm not just waiting for farts.

183
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:17,397
Thank goodness.

184
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,199
I'm doing all the scut work.

185
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,737
Well...

186
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:25,973
Welcome to your surgical residency.

187
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:29,109
Thank you.

188
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:34,882
There. I think that was it.

189
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,253
I don't think so.

190
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:42,222
I'll wait a little longer.

191
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,657
This is important.

192
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:50,163
The procedure is called a laparotomy.

193
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:53,601
Mm.

194
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:56,103
Yeah, your heart sounds good.

195
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:58,772
So, we make a long incision
down the middle of your abdomen,

196
00:08:58,806 --> 00:08:59,807
expose the tumor...

197
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,841
Am I going to die?

198
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:07,080
Dr. Melendez is the best surgeon
I have ever seen...

199
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:09,216
Can this all wait?

200
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:10,784
You have a very serious condition.

201
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:11,785
It's not advisable to...

202
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:13,253
Just a couple of weeks.

203
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,989
My son is getting married next weekend.

204
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:17,858
They look very happy.

205
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,627
After the initial incision...

206
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,929
They've been planning this for months.

207
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:22,963
If they have to reschedule...

208
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:26,033
Well... well, this...
this is complicated surgery,

209
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,267
but if all goes well,

210
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,802
recovery is pretty easy.

211
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:32,139
No need to reschedule anything.

212
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:33,140
And if it doesn't?

213
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,208
If it doesn't go well?

214
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:41,815
My husband died in a car accident

215
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:44,818
a couple of years ago.

216
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:48,255
Mark is our only child.

217
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:50,290
I can't die right before his wedding.

218
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,259
I can't.

219
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,664
You're not gonna die.

220
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:58,365
You will be at the wedding.

221
00:09:58,398 --> 00:09:59,700
Looking beautiful.

222
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,979
You're not supposed to make
promises like that, Dr. Browne.

223
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:13,914
Yeah,
I told her what she needed to hear.

224
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,983
Officially,
our legal department's policy is...

225
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:18,018
tell the ugly truth...
the uglier the better.

226
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:18,819
Is that what you did?

227
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:20,721
I don't think that's what you did.

228
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:22,122
Yeah, well, it's a dumb policy.

229
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,757
She needs to have the surgery.

230
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,292
Scaring her would change nothing.

231
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:26,727
Right, because a much better policy

232
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,995
would be to lie to all of our patients

233
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:28,929
whenever it makes you feel better.

234
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,864
No, it doesn't make me feel better.

235
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:31,999
It makes her feel better.

236
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,303
I'm pathetic.

237
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,206
What?

238
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:41,141
I am pathetic.

239
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:42,409
And here's my thinking, so just...

240
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:43,711
just bear with me,

241
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:45,946
because it kind of insults both of us.

242
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:49,149
You met that woman an hour ago,
and you lied to her.

243
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:52,152
A pity lie because you
obviously care about her.

244
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:56,023
A pity lie that has absolutely
zero upside for you,

245
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:57,891
but I can't make you,
the world's softest touch,

246
00:10:57,925 --> 00:11:00,027
care about me.

247
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,205
Hey.

248
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,447
I need a consult.

249
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,816
What? You have a question about this?

250
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,284
This patient is perfectly healthy.

251
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:26,253
There's not even any artifact
in these images.

252
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:27,187
Yeah, which in turn

253
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,989
raises an interesting
medical question...

254
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:32,092
why the hell did this patient
get an MRI?

255
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,493
I don't know anything about this.

256
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,328
Yeah. Someone on your team ordered it.

257
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,831
It's your responsibility,
which makes it your fault.

258
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:40,167
What... How did you...?

259
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,903
It's my department.
It's my job to know everything.

260
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,437
Well, then, since I work for you,

261
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:46,907
doesn't that make all of this
actually your fault?

262
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,875
Oh, I'm sorry,

263
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:50,310
I stopped listening after
"I work for you."

264
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:55,348
Does that hurt?

265
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,449
Yes.

266
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:58,819
Does that hurt?

267
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:00,821
Yes.

268
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:01,989
Does that hurt?

269
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:03,090
Yes.

270
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:04,257
She has a tummy ache.

271
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,458
That's what they do... they ache. Shh.

272
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:07,227
She's just trying to get out of school.
Again.

273
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,862
Where do you think
she learned that from?

274
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:10,831
You don't think she hears you
calling in sick to work

275
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:11,965
right before you go golfing?

276
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:13,834
I like school.

277
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,035
Me too.

278
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,870
What did you eat for dinner last night?

279
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:18,471
Cereal.

280
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:19,940
I thought you made meatloaf. I did.

281
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,842
And it got cold while
we were waiting for you.

282
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,543
I want D-dimer, lactate, and amylase...

283
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,345
What tests are you ordering?

284
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:28,381
D-dimer, lactate, and amylase.

285
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,017
For a tummy ache? Hmm?

286
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,318
Yes.

287
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,520
I'm concerned it may be...

288
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:38,125
Shall we talk outside?

289
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:39,492
I told you something was wrong.

290
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:41,128
You're happy she might be sick?

291
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:42,229
I'm happy you're wrong.

292
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,997
Yeah. Let's talk outside.

293
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,037
Have they been bickering
like that the whole time?

294
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,005
I didn't notice. They aren't sick.

295
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,273
Yeah, they're what we call a vector.

296
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:54,507
Hmm?

297
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,243
A carrier. A cause of disease.

298
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,278
You mean the parents? Yeah.

299
00:12:58,311 --> 00:12:59,880
That little girl has a tummy ache

300
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:01,849
because mommy and daddy
won't stop fighting.

301
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:03,951
This isn't a medical issue.
Send them home.

302
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:05,285
Could be intestinal malrotation,

303
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:06,519
which could quickly become fatal.

304
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:09,089
And every patient in this
hospital could have malaria,

305
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,024
but that doesn't mean
we're gonna go around testing

306
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:12,559
for every condition
we think they could have.

307
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,261
For example, that MRI you ordered

308
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,963
on the guy with the ear infection?

309
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:17,130
Nice call, genius.

310
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:18,832
Thank you.

311
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:20,000
I was being sarcastic.

312
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,301
It's normal. He's healthy.

313
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:22,335
Send him home, too.

314
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:25,538
Why are you smiling?

315
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:26,874
Because you're right.

316
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:28,575
So you thought he was making a mistake

317
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:29,877
and didn't say anything?

318
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,579
Just stood by watching, taking notes

319
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:34,181
while he wasted everybody's time?

320
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:35,348
Is that your job?

321
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:36,116
In my experience,

322
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,885
doctors don't listen to nurses.

323
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:39,519
And they only talk to us to lecture us

324
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,454
when they figure
we screwed something up.

325
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,095
From now on, you don't run any tests

326
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:48,896
you don't have to run.

327
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:50,964
How do I know if a test is needed

328
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:52,065
until after I run it?

329
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,467
She'll tell you.

330
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,603
Today, she's your boss.

331
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:15,022
I could never eat before surgery.

332
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:18,225
Puke? I could do that.

333
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:19,960
I get cranky if I don't eat.

334
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,230
I hear Shaun made the call. Mm.

335
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:25,065
He's an excellent diagnostician.

336
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:27,067
You should get him a job in radiology.

337
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,002
He doesn't want to be a radiologist.

338
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,437
He wants to be a surgeon.

339
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,505
That's what we hired him to be.

340
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,508
That's what I worked damn hard
to hire him to be.

341
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,310
Not a glorified orderly.

342
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:39,246
Every resident does scut work.

343
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,248
So you're treating him
like anybody else?

344
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:43,250
Are you? Yes, yes, I am.

345
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:45,252
He more than earned the right
to be here.

346
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:47,220
He has had to get past people like you

347
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:49,322
and their prejudices
every step of the way.

348
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:51,591
Prejudices? Yeah, prejudices.

349
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,160
You have any idea how many patients

350
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:54,527
he's scared the crap out of today?

351
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,629
How many wasted tests he ordered?

352
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:57,931
So teach him.

353
00:14:57,965 --> 00:14:59,266
I'm doing that.

354
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:02,302
I'm teaching you both
that he doesn't belong.

355
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,604
Okay.

356
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,341
You're gonna make me pull rank,
I will pull rank.

357
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,243
This is my hospital.

358
00:15:09,277 --> 00:15:11,679
But it's my team.

359
00:15:11,712 --> 00:15:13,414
You can't tell me how to run my team.

360
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:25,193
Hey.

361
00:15:25,226 --> 00:15:26,460
How are you doing?

362
00:15:26,494 --> 00:15:28,429
What's the point of sarcasm?

363
00:15:28,462 --> 00:15:30,464
Um...

364
00:15:31,032 --> 00:15:32,033
Well, uh...

365
00:15:32,066 --> 00:15:36,304
Like, sometimes,
it's a way of critiquing people

366
00:15:36,337 --> 00:15:37,972
in a way that's funny

367
00:15:38,006 --> 00:15:39,440
so they don't feel quite so bad.

368
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:41,042
Isn't it just lying?

369
00:15:41,075 --> 00:15:42,576
Mm, well, it's not lying,

370
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,612
because people know you're lying.

371
00:15:44,645 --> 00:15:47,348
I'm not good at that.

372
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:50,718
You may remember me from last year.

373
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:52,453
We sell chocolate bars every year

374
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:54,455
to pay for our class trip to Mt.
Rushmore.

375
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:55,723
Okay.

376
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:57,625
But this year we're not going to Mt.
Rushmore,

377
00:15:57,658 --> 00:16:00,094
because Kenny can't go.

378
00:16:00,128 --> 00:16:01,562
He's got cancer.

379
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:04,465
So, Samantha had the idea

380
00:16:04,498 --> 00:16:06,334
that if he can't go,
none of us would go,

381
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:08,236
and we all thought
that was a great idea.

382
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:10,538
So, we're gonna have a party
at the hospital for him.

383
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,608
There are two Kennys in your class.

384
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:16,210
Is it Kenny L. or Kenny M.?

385
00:16:16,244 --> 00:16:18,012
No one's sick.

386
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:19,147
Well, you lied?

387
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,748
You weren't supposed to lie. Yeah.

388
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:23,084
And you and me aren't
supposed to starve.

389
00:16:23,117 --> 00:16:24,318
We need money for food.

390
00:16:25,086 --> 00:16:26,654
Was any of that true?

391
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:28,256
Yeah.

392
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:29,690
We're not going to Mt. Rushmore.

393
00:16:36,064 --> 00:16:37,165
I can't discharge people

394
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:39,033
if I think they might still be sick.

395
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:40,168
Um, of course not.

396
00:16:40,201 --> 00:16:41,169
Why would you?

397
00:16:41,202 --> 00:16:44,372
Dr. Melendez made Nurse Fryday
my boss today.

398
00:16:44,405 --> 00:16:47,241
Should I speak to Dr. Glassman?

399
00:16:47,275 --> 00:16:49,377
No.

400
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:51,512
What did you think this job was?

401
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:53,181
To save people's lives.

402
00:16:53,214 --> 00:16:54,082
No.

403
00:16:54,115 --> 00:16:57,651
I mean, yeah,
sometimes we do save lives.

404
00:16:57,685 --> 00:17:00,088
But the job...

405
00:17:00,121 --> 00:17:02,390
It's doing whatever
Melendez asks us to do.

406
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:06,060
Paging Dr. Browne.

407
00:17:06,094 --> 00:17:08,529
Paging Dr. Browne to the O.R.

408
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:17,671
I'm Dr. Claire Browne.

409
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:19,073
I'm first assist today,

410
00:17:19,107 --> 00:17:20,674
and I'll be leading the timeout.

411
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,644
Patient's name, Stephanie Willis.

412
00:17:23,677 --> 00:17:24,678
Scheduled surgery?

413
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:27,415
Excision of an indeterminate
retroperitoneal tumor.

414
00:17:27,448 --> 00:17:29,283
We don't anticipate

415
00:17:29,317 --> 00:17:30,718
any complications with the surgery.

416
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:32,586
Thank you, Dr. Browne.

417
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,721
Ten blade.

418
00:17:43,764 --> 00:17:45,299
Let's remove a tumor.

419
00:17:49,337 --> 00:17:50,504
Excuse me.

420
00:17:55,343 --> 00:17:55,876
No.

421
00:17:58,212 --> 00:17:59,580
It might be infected.

422
00:17:59,613 --> 00:18:00,514
It's not.

423
00:18:00,548 --> 00:18:02,283
There is some discoloration.

424
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:03,417
He's 82 years old.

425
00:18:03,451 --> 00:18:04,818
Everything is discolored.

426
00:18:12,393 --> 00:18:13,594
Once we get through the muscle layer,

427
00:18:13,627 --> 00:18:14,695
proceed carefully.

428
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:17,698
Blood pressure, 120 over 70.

429
00:18:17,731 --> 00:18:18,766
Heart rate 60.

430
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,234
She's holding steady.

431
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:23,504
I've opened the facia.

432
00:18:25,373 --> 00:18:27,575
You kept your puke?

433
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:30,344
Yeah, I thought you'd want to see it.

434
00:18:30,378 --> 00:18:33,214
It looks like puke.

435
00:18:33,247 --> 00:18:35,349
No. No, no. It's not the regular color.

436
00:18:35,383 --> 00:18:37,485
Your puke has a regular color?

437
00:18:37,518 --> 00:18:38,486
Yeah.

438
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:40,421
It is a bit of an unusual color.

439
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:41,789
We could order some...

440
00:18:44,258 --> 00:18:46,860
I'm sending you home.

441
00:18:46,894 --> 00:18:48,762
You sure?

442
00:18:48,796 --> 00:18:50,398
It... It's safe for me to go home?

443
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:53,467
I don't know what to say.

444
00:18:53,501 --> 00:18:55,636
You'll learn.

445
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:56,704
By doing.

446
00:19:05,246 --> 00:19:06,514
Hi.

447
00:19:09,717 --> 00:19:11,685
My brother said
there's a kid named Kenny,

448
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:13,387
and he's sick, and there might...

449
00:19:13,421 --> 00:19:14,488
you should give us money.

450
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,293
So, am I okay?

451
00:19:21,695 --> 00:19:23,397
Am... Am I okay?

452
00:19:23,431 --> 00:19:25,433
According to all hospital rules

453
00:19:25,466 --> 00:19:27,935
and direct instructions given to me,
yes.

454
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:38,812
Whoa.

455
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:40,514
We need a better exposure of this tumor.

456
00:19:50,324 --> 00:19:51,191
Let's get this thing open.

457
00:19:51,225 --> 00:19:52,893
I've got to see where it's safe to cut.

458
00:19:56,397 --> 00:19:58,766
I can't see anywhere where this
tumor hasn't encased her arteries.

459
00:19:58,799 --> 00:19:59,833
Claire, tell me you got something.

460
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:01,535
I've got nothing.

461
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:03,904
This tumor is way bigger
than it looked on the scans.

462
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:04,905
Okay, come on.

463
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:10,444
I...I can't even see her aorta.

464
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:12,846
That's a problem.

465
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:41,410
Is that the girl
with the bickering parents?

466
00:20:41,443 --> 00:20:43,712
Didn't we send her home four hours ago?

467
00:20:46,415 --> 00:20:47,616
Dr. Murphy,

468
00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:49,151
Dr. Melendez needs you in surgery.

469
00:20:56,358 --> 00:20:58,427
That won't be necessary.

470
00:21:05,634 --> 00:21:08,170
The tumor's entirely encased
the large abdominal arteries.

471
00:21:08,203 --> 00:21:09,071
That's very bad.

472
00:21:09,104 --> 00:21:10,372
If it's in the artery walls,

473
00:21:10,405 --> 00:21:12,341
it's going to be impossible to cut out

474
00:21:12,374 --> 00:21:13,375
without killing her.

475
00:21:13,408 --> 00:21:14,176
You should get a biopsy

476
00:21:14,209 --> 00:21:16,045
to determine where the margins are.

477
00:21:16,078 --> 00:21:17,579
Thank you.

478
00:21:17,612 --> 00:21:19,314
You're welcome.

479
00:21:19,348 --> 00:21:21,350
I was being sarcastic... again.

480
00:21:21,383 --> 00:21:23,585
Oh, I-I see,

481
00:21:23,618 --> 00:21:25,520
because you are already know
everything I said,

482
00:21:25,554 --> 00:21:28,457
and you already sent a biopsy
to the lab?

483
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,758
Yes, 'cause I'm a doctor, too.

484
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:32,394
Yes. But you need me?

485
00:21:32,427 --> 00:21:33,762
Yeah, I need you to run down to the lab

486
00:21:33,795 --> 00:21:35,330
and hurry them along.

487
00:21:51,413 --> 00:21:53,282
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

488
00:21:53,315 --> 00:21:54,783
I'm a surgical resident.

489
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,485
Dr. Melendez sent you a biopsy.

490
00:21:56,518 --> 00:21:58,153
When will the results be ready?

491
00:21:58,187 --> 00:21:59,554
When I get to it.

492
00:21:59,588 --> 00:22:01,356
It's very important.

493
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,757
They're all very important.

494
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:06,260
Let me see the other test orders.

495
00:22:06,294 --> 00:22:09,263
I'll tell you which ones
are most important,

496
00:22:09,297 --> 00:22:10,831
and you can do them in that order.

497
00:22:10,864 --> 00:22:12,566
I'll be honest and fair.

498
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,203
That is not the way that it works.

499
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,206
Now go wait your turn.

500
00:22:22,243 --> 00:22:23,411
Do it again.

501
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:34,555
Get the hell away from me, you moron.

502
00:22:34,588 --> 00:22:36,224
Let's get out of here!

503
00:22:38,226 --> 00:22:39,493
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

504
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:42,830
If you want to get anything in life,
Shaun,

505
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:44,532
there's one thing you got to do.

506
00:22:44,565 --> 00:22:46,167
Never be afraid.

507
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:49,170
You're the moron!

508
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,557
If you don't do
Dr. Melendez's test right now,

509
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,525
I will throw a rock through your window.

510
00:23:16,198 --> 00:23:18,400
Well, I wouldn't want that.

511
00:23:20,635 --> 00:23:22,304
Go have a seat.

512
00:23:22,337 --> 00:23:24,473
Your results will be ready
in 15 minutes.

513
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,518
You got a minute?

514
00:23:36,551 --> 00:23:38,720
I have a patient lying in the O.R.

515
00:23:38,753 --> 00:23:40,189
waiting for lab results,

516
00:23:40,222 --> 00:23:41,423
and I'm sitting here
trying to figure out

517
00:23:41,456 --> 00:23:42,257
what the hell I'm gonna do next,

518
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:43,124
and I don't like any of my options,

519
00:23:43,158 --> 00:23:46,728
so...yeah, unfortunately it seems I do.

520
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:48,463
Okay, we can talk another time.

521
00:23:48,497 --> 00:23:49,598
Glassman talked to you?

522
00:23:52,267 --> 00:23:54,436
I don't have a problem
with an autistic doctor.

523
00:23:54,469 --> 00:23:56,771
No, you just have a problem
with one working for you.

524
00:23:56,805 --> 00:23:57,872
Really? That's how you see me?

525
00:23:57,906 --> 00:23:59,774
Let's not make this personal.

526
00:23:59,808 --> 00:24:02,244
You're accusing me of prejudice.

527
00:24:02,277 --> 00:24:03,778
I have a problem with the doctor

528
00:24:03,812 --> 00:24:05,714
who has a problem with communication.

529
00:24:05,747 --> 00:24:09,718
Okay, let's make this personal.

530
00:24:11,686 --> 00:24:12,954
Who do you respect at this hospital?

531
00:24:12,987 --> 00:24:15,924
You and Glassman.

532
00:24:15,957 --> 00:24:17,792
And who do you not respect?

533
00:24:21,596 --> 00:24:23,298
And does it bother you

534
00:24:23,332 --> 00:24:25,434
that it looks like
you're on the wrong team?

535
00:24:27,802 --> 00:24:30,205
If the tumor hasn't invaded
into the arterial walls,

536
00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:31,806
we could create a plane of dissection.

537
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,708
Well, if it's a noninvasive liposarcoma

538
00:24:33,742 --> 00:24:35,510
we can work it off from the outside.

539
00:24:35,544 --> 00:24:37,379
Blunt dissection and tissue forceps...

540
00:24:37,412 --> 00:24:38,680
peel it off piece by piece.

541
00:24:48,723 --> 00:24:50,692
It's a leiomyosarcoma.

542
00:24:52,661 --> 00:24:54,896
Well, that sucks.

543
00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:55,997
Yes, it's sad.

544
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,232
The surgery's impossible.

545
00:24:57,266 --> 00:25:00,935
Well, might as well wake her up...

546
00:25:00,969 --> 00:25:03,272
let her know she has
three months to live,

547
00:25:03,305 --> 00:25:04,973
offer palliative care.

548
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,882
The surgery isn't impossible...

549
00:25:13,915 --> 00:25:16,951
just, very, very, very difficult.

550
00:25:16,985 --> 00:25:19,421
Yes, in the sense
that we'll be operating blind.

551
00:25:19,454 --> 00:25:21,923
Yes,
because the left kidney is in the way.

552
00:25:21,956 --> 00:25:23,958
The healthy left kidney.

553
00:25:23,992 --> 00:25:24,959
Both kidneys are healthy, Jared.

554
00:25:24,993 --> 00:25:25,994
She only needs one.

555
00:25:26,027 --> 00:25:28,497
Without the left one,
it's theoretically possible

556
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,265
to access the tumor and remove it.

557
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:32,401
You're suggesting we cut out
a perfectly healthy organ

558
00:25:32,434 --> 00:25:33,968
just to get a better view? Yes.

559
00:25:34,002 --> 00:25:36,237
But she might die anyway.
Yes. Quite probably.

560
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,742
I have to go. I have a boil to lance.

561
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:47,482
I mean, it's a brilliant...

562
00:25:47,516 --> 00:25:49,451
very, very, very terrible idea.

563
00:25:52,554 --> 00:25:54,456
Close her up and wake her up.

564
00:25:54,489 --> 00:25:55,857
Who wants to join me when I tell her

565
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,359
she has six weeks left to live?

566
00:25:59,928 --> 00:26:02,364
There is one possibility.

567
00:26:05,367 --> 00:26:06,267
If we removed the left kidney,

568
00:26:06,301 --> 00:26:07,769
we might be able to get
a good enough view

569
00:26:07,802 --> 00:26:08,903
to successfully remove the mass.

570
00:26:08,937 --> 00:26:11,506
Take out a healthy kidney

571
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,674
to get a better view?

572
00:26:12,707 --> 00:26:13,775
That's insane.

573
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:17,446
A good view's half the battle
in any operation.

574
00:26:17,479 --> 00:26:20,815
Most likely outcome
is we'd be depriving her

575
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:22,016
of what little time she has left.

576
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,352
But if we succeed...

577
00:26:23,385 --> 00:26:25,019
No...

578
00:26:25,053 --> 00:26:26,755
You want to do this
'cause it's exciting.

579
00:26:26,788 --> 00:26:28,022
You want to be a hero.

580
00:26:28,056 --> 00:26:30,825
But if you fail, this woman dies.

581
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:32,060
She misses her son's wedding.

582
00:26:33,828 --> 00:26:35,063
Well, that's the issue, isn't it?

583
00:26:36,064 --> 00:26:38,900
You promised this woman she'll be okay.

584
00:26:46,575 --> 00:26:48,042
She had to do this surgery.

585
00:26:48,076 --> 00:26:50,445
I might as well tell her good things.

586
00:26:50,479 --> 00:26:52,514
The reason we don't make
patients promises

587
00:26:52,547 --> 00:26:53,515
isn't just for legal.

588
00:26:53,548 --> 00:26:56,451
Jared's right.
Your judgment is compromised.

589
00:26:56,485 --> 00:26:57,919
I still think... You're not objective.

590
00:26:57,952 --> 00:26:58,953
Who the hell is?

591
00:27:00,755 --> 00:27:02,691
We should at least wake her up,

592
00:27:02,724 --> 00:27:05,927
explain what we found,
what we're hoping to do,

593
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,061
and get a new consent.

594
00:27:07,095 --> 00:27:08,129
What we're hoping to do

595
00:27:08,162 --> 00:27:10,699
is exactly what you told her
we were going to do...

596
00:27:10,732 --> 00:27:12,033
remove that tumor.

597
00:27:12,066 --> 00:27:13,668
The only thing we'd be explaining is

598
00:27:13,702 --> 00:27:14,869
why you undersold the risks.

599
00:27:15,737 --> 00:27:17,839
We're doing the surgery.

600
00:27:18,773 --> 00:27:20,809
And, Jared, you're my new number two.

601
00:27:34,889 --> 00:27:35,790
Mayos.

602
00:27:41,062 --> 00:27:42,997
I'm going to open the fascia
and expose the kidney.

603
00:27:43,031 --> 00:27:44,599
You clamp the renal hilum.

604
00:27:44,633 --> 00:27:45,567
Clamp.

605
00:27:52,907 --> 00:27:54,809
We just cut off the blood supply

606
00:27:54,843 --> 00:27:56,711
to a perfectly healthy kidney.

607
00:27:56,745 --> 00:27:57,779
If we needed color commentary,

608
00:27:57,812 --> 00:27:58,980
I would have hired Jeff Van Gundy.

609
00:28:06,988 --> 00:28:09,658
Shaun, I believe you've met Trevor.

610
00:28:09,691 --> 00:28:11,426
Yes. I sent him home.

611
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,762
Yes, well, he didn't go home.

612
00:28:13,795 --> 00:28:15,196
He actually came to

613
00:28:15,229 --> 00:28:18,166
the president of the hospital instead.

614
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:19,668
H-He said you sent him home

615
00:28:19,701 --> 00:28:20,802
even though you thought he was sick.

616
00:28:20,835 --> 00:28:22,571
I specifically never said that.

617
00:28:22,604 --> 00:28:24,072
I made sure not to say that. No. Oh.

618
00:28:24,105 --> 00:28:25,640
What... what the hell does that mean?

619
00:28:25,674 --> 00:28:27,509
What does that mean, Shaun?
A-Am I healthy?

620
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:28,643
Probably. You're a doctor.

621
00:28:28,677 --> 00:28:30,545
You're... you're supposed to know.
No, we're not...

622
00:28:30,579 --> 00:28:31,946
Nobody knows anything for sure.

623
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,449
Anybody could drop dead of
a heart attack at any time.

624
00:28:34,483 --> 00:28:35,684
Who is this guy?

625
00:28:35,717 --> 00:28:38,653
Am I... Am I gonna have a heart attack?

626
00:28:38,687 --> 00:28:41,055
Shaun has some difficulty

627
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:42,624
with certain social interactions,

628
00:28:42,657 --> 00:28:43,424
but if he says that...

629
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:44,859
I don't give a crap what he says.

630
00:28:44,893 --> 00:28:46,561
W-What do you say?

631
00:28:46,595 --> 00:28:47,562
Am I healthy?

632
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,832
I've reviewed your chart,

633
00:28:50,865 --> 00:28:52,767
and I can say with complete confidence

634
00:28:52,801 --> 00:28:56,638
that you are in peak physical condition.
Thank God.

635
00:29:06,348 --> 00:29:10,052
Shaun, people need reassurance.

636
00:29:10,085 --> 00:29:12,121
I told him he was safe to go home.

637
00:29:12,154 --> 00:29:14,356
I was very clear. W-With your words...

638
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:16,225
Your actions said something
completely different.

639
00:29:16,258 --> 00:29:17,026
No, they didn't.

640
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:19,061
My actions were completely silent.

641
00:29:19,094 --> 00:29:24,066
When you reassure someone,
they have to receive it.

642
00:29:24,099 --> 00:29:25,267
You have to gauge

643
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,137
whether they actually are reassured.

644
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,271
You understand?

645
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,275
When did you review Trevor's chart?

646
00:29:34,443 --> 00:29:35,444
I didn't.

647
00:29:36,578 --> 00:29:38,013
It's not really a lie.

648
00:29:38,047 --> 00:29:40,149
If you say that he is safe to go home,

649
00:29:40,182 --> 00:29:42,717
then I know for a fact
that he's safe to go home.

650
00:29:44,719 --> 00:29:47,122
I sent a girl home today.

651
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:51,493
How often do people
develop stomach issues

652
00:29:51,526 --> 00:29:52,594
because of their brain?

653
00:29:52,627 --> 00:29:55,197
Based on my personal experience?

654
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,565
Every single day.

655
00:29:59,368 --> 00:30:01,270
I want D-dimer, lactate, and amylase

656
00:30:01,303 --> 00:30:03,338
for a 10-year-old girl, Martine LaDuff.

657
00:30:03,372 --> 00:30:06,241
She might have a tummy ache
caused by stress.

658
00:30:06,275 --> 00:30:08,177
Or she might not.

659
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:09,711
Hi, Shaun.

660
00:30:09,744 --> 00:30:11,446
Hi, Carly.

661
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,815
That's a lot of tests
for an upset stomach.

662
00:30:13,848 --> 00:30:15,184
You could get in trouble.

663
00:30:15,217 --> 00:30:16,751
That's definitely true.

664
00:30:19,454 --> 00:30:20,522
Remove the kidney.

665
00:30:20,555 --> 00:30:22,691
All right. It's coming out.

666
00:30:33,868 --> 00:30:35,570
Let's get in there with some suction,
Claire,

667
00:30:35,604 --> 00:30:37,472
so we can get a better view
of what we're dealing with.

668
00:30:42,844 --> 00:30:44,045
There it is.

669
00:30:46,715 --> 00:30:48,683
It's a mess.

670
00:30:48,717 --> 00:30:50,819
Yes, it is.

671
00:30:50,852 --> 00:30:54,323
But now it's a mess we can see.

672
00:30:54,356 --> 00:30:57,726
Everything is within normal range.

673
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:58,860
Hmm.

674
00:30:58,893 --> 00:31:01,330
Slightly elevated lactate and amylase,

675
00:31:01,363 --> 00:31:02,697
and she's very small.

676
00:31:02,731 --> 00:31:06,435
Normal should be lower.

677
00:31:09,304 --> 00:31:11,406
What do you think she has?

678
00:31:14,243 --> 00:31:15,310
Thank you.

679
00:32:14,536 --> 00:32:16,505
W-What the hell? It... it's after 1:00.

680
00:32:16,538 --> 00:32:17,539
I ran tests.

681
00:32:17,572 --> 00:32:18,873
The results were ambiguous.

682
00:32:18,907 --> 00:32:21,276
I think Martine
has intestinal malrotation

683
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,944
and that a volvulus has occurred.

684
00:32:22,977 --> 00:32:25,680
Ambiguous tests told you this.

685
00:32:25,714 --> 00:32:26,815
It's a genetic condition.

686
00:32:26,848 --> 00:32:28,717
The symptoms are very similar to stress.

687
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,519
Call us in the morning.

688
00:32:30,552 --> 00:32:31,886
Okay,
she may not be alive in the morning.

689
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:37,692
Does your boss know you're here?

690
00:32:39,694 --> 00:32:41,263
No, I think he'd be upset with me

691
00:32:41,296 --> 00:32:42,264
for being here.

692
00:32:43,565 --> 00:32:44,666
I am not waking my daughter up

693
00:32:44,699 --> 00:32:45,767
in the middle of a school night

694
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,768
because of some freak.

695
00:32:46,801 --> 00:32:48,537
And you don't need
to call me in the morning,

696
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:50,839
because I'll be calling
your boss in the morning.

697
00:32:59,781 --> 00:33:01,616
Were you being sarcastic?

698
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,518
How hard is it to get rid of someone.
I told him...

699
00:33:03,552 --> 00:33:05,387
You're right. I'm weird.

700
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,622
Part of my weirdness
is that I perseverate.

701
00:33:07,656 --> 00:33:09,758
That means I keep thinking about things.

702
00:33:09,791 --> 00:33:11,760
So I will keep knocking on your door

703
00:33:11,793 --> 00:33:13,528
until I know Martine is okay.

704
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:22,404
Martine.

705
00:33:23,472 --> 00:33:24,806
Martine.

706
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,741
Martine, you need to wake up!

707
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:30,779
Honey? Martine?

708
00:33:30,812 --> 00:33:32,347
She vomited.

709
00:33:32,381 --> 00:33:33,648
I-I can't wake her!

710
00:33:33,682 --> 00:33:34,483
I'll call 911.

711
00:33:34,516 --> 00:33:36,485
N-No. There's no time.

712
00:33:36,518 --> 00:33:37,719
Do you have a car? Yeah.

713
00:33:57,606 --> 00:33:59,374
Shaun...

714
00:33:59,408 --> 00:34:01,376
what's wrong?

715
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:02,444
What's wrong?

716
00:34:02,477 --> 00:34:04,579
Hey, hey. You called me. What's wrong?

717
00:34:04,613 --> 00:34:06,415
Hey, look at me. Look at me!

718
00:34:06,448 --> 00:34:07,882
What's... You don't have to say
the whole thing, okay?

719
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:09,351
Just one thing, okay?

720
00:34:09,384 --> 00:34:10,785
One thing, My... my brother.

721
00:34:27,068 --> 00:34:29,404
Hold on, Shaun. Hold on now, hold on.

722
00:34:39,414 --> 00:34:41,650
Her pulse is too weak
to perfuse her organs.

723
00:34:41,683 --> 00:34:43,552
What? What does that...

724
00:34:46,521 --> 00:34:47,522
Jerry!

725
00:34:48,457 --> 00:34:49,458
Please hurry.

726
00:34:58,032 --> 00:34:59,734
Patient is a 10-year-old female.

727
00:34:59,768 --> 00:35:01,603
She has bradycardia
with hypovolemic shock.

728
00:35:03,538 --> 00:35:05,006
She needs oxygen, IV adrenaline... Go!

729
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:06,375
and a liter of saline.

730
00:35:06,408 --> 00:35:07,809
Wide open, please! Coming through!

731
00:35:09,844 --> 00:35:11,713
Her pulse is better.
She needs an ultrasound.

732
00:35:18,453 --> 00:35:19,454
That is it.

733
00:35:19,488 --> 00:35:20,855
Wow.

734
00:35:23,091 --> 00:35:24,593
I think you got it all.

735
00:35:24,626 --> 00:35:26,428
You "think"? No. You definitely did.

736
00:35:26,461 --> 00:35:27,896
I just can't quite believe it.

737
00:35:27,929 --> 00:35:28,697
It was your idea.

738
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:30,932
You should have more confidence.

739
00:35:33,502 --> 00:35:34,669
Nice work, Doctor.

740
00:35:57,158 --> 00:35:59,060
There.

741
00:35:59,093 --> 00:36:00,895
The small bowel is twisted around

742
00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:02,597
the superior mesenteric artery.

743
00:36:02,631 --> 00:36:04,799
Martine needs surgery immediately.

744
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:07,602
We need to confirm with Dr. Melendez.

745
00:36:07,636 --> 00:36:10,004
N-No. Dr. Melendez is in surgery.

746
00:36:10,038 --> 00:36:11,506
Part of Martine's bowel is dying

747
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,874
and killing her with it. No.

748
00:36:12,907 --> 00:36:14,943
You cannot make these calls on your own.

749
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,545
Dr. Melendez was very clear.

750
00:36:18,112 --> 00:36:19,514
He was very clear.

751
00:36:19,548 --> 00:36:21,450
It's past midnight,
which means it's tomorrow,

752
00:36:21,483 --> 00:36:23,051
which means you're no longer my boss.

753
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,490
Is this the O.R. scheduler?

754
00:36:28,523 --> 00:36:30,825
Yes, this is Dr. Murphy.

755
00:36:30,859 --> 00:36:32,761
Prepare an O.R. for surgery.

756
00:36:39,801 --> 00:36:40,969
Ten blade.

757
00:36:48,543 --> 00:36:50,111
I'll take it from here.

758
00:36:50,144 --> 00:36:52,681
Nice diagnosis.
I'll handle the repair work.

759
00:36:54,716 --> 00:36:56,217
Is Stephanie okay?

760
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,852
Yes.

761
00:36:57,886 --> 00:37:00,088
Jared had an excellent idea,
and she's gonna be fine.

762
00:37:00,121 --> 00:37:01,122
Light.

763
00:37:05,494 --> 00:37:06,661
Would you like me to assist?

764
00:37:06,695 --> 00:37:07,529
Mm, pretty basic...

765
00:37:07,562 --> 00:37:09,531
I think I can take this one on my own.

766
00:37:09,564 --> 00:37:10,832
Go home. Get some sleep.

767
00:37:12,567 --> 00:37:13,668
Let him stay.

768
00:37:13,702 --> 00:37:16,805
Dr. Andrews, I believe our opinions

769
00:37:16,838 --> 00:37:18,239
on the wisdom of hiring Dr. Murphy...

770
00:37:18,272 --> 00:37:20,208
That battle is lost.

771
00:37:20,241 --> 00:37:21,876
Shaun is here, and we have to accept it,

772
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,678
and we will treat him
like any other resident.

773
00:37:23,712 --> 00:37:24,746
Sir, it's my team.

774
00:37:24,779 --> 00:37:25,780
And it's my department.

775
00:37:27,516 --> 00:37:29,217
Dr. Murphy.

776
00:37:33,788 --> 00:37:35,256
Back on suction... congratulations.

777
00:37:44,899 --> 00:37:46,100
Whoo!

778
00:37:46,134 --> 00:37:47,569
I am gonna get a drink.

779
00:37:47,602 --> 00:37:49,237
I'm way too wound up to sleep.

780
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,939
You care to join me?

781
00:37:50,972 --> 00:37:52,006
For either?

782
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,775
Don't think so.

783
00:37:53,808 --> 00:37:55,276
Seriously?

784
00:37:55,309 --> 00:37:57,111
We were just part of something amazing.

785
00:37:57,145 --> 00:37:59,180
We reached into that woman,
and we healed her.

786
00:37:59,213 --> 00:38:00,982
And you're what?

787
00:38:01,015 --> 00:38:02,951
Cranky?

788
00:38:02,984 --> 00:38:04,719
Maybe you could learn something from me.

789
00:38:04,753 --> 00:38:05,820
Like what?

790
00:38:05,854 --> 00:38:06,921
To steal credit?

791
00:38:06,955 --> 00:38:09,591
Make yourself a hero with Shaun's idea?

792
00:38:09,624 --> 00:38:10,792
No, but I fought for it.

793
00:38:10,825 --> 00:38:12,561
I went out on a limb for him.

794
00:38:12,594 --> 00:38:14,028
I deserve credit for that.

795
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:17,131
Why didn't you rat me out
as soon as I brought it up?

796
00:38:18,266 --> 00:38:19,701
It seemed beside the point.

797
00:38:19,734 --> 00:38:20,602
No, you didn't rat me out

798
00:38:20,635 --> 00:38:22,103
'cause you thought the idea was crazy.

799
00:38:22,136 --> 00:38:24,873
You were letting me take the fall.

800
00:38:24,906 --> 00:38:26,708
Is that fair?

801
00:38:28,142 --> 00:38:31,580
My idea if it fails,
but Shaun's if it succeeds?

802
00:38:33,047 --> 00:38:35,650
But I'll tell you what...

803
00:38:35,684 --> 00:38:38,019
I'll accept that you're right.

804
00:38:38,052 --> 00:38:40,154
I'll apologize to the whole team

805
00:38:40,188 --> 00:38:41,756
if you prove to me

806
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:42,791
that you're not a hypocrite.

807
00:38:42,824 --> 00:38:45,059
How am I supposed to prove
something like that?

808
00:38:45,093 --> 00:38:48,930
Our patient's about
to come out of anesthesia.

809
00:38:48,963 --> 00:38:50,098
Tell her the truth.

810
00:38:50,131 --> 00:38:53,167
When she wakes up and hears what we did,

811
00:38:53,201 --> 00:38:55,970
how we miraculously saved her life,

812
00:38:56,004 --> 00:38:58,973
be honest with her... about credit.

813
00:38:59,007 --> 00:39:01,209
Tell her you didn't want to do it.

814
00:39:01,242 --> 00:39:05,814
Tell her that you wanted
to send her home to die.

815
00:39:12,187 --> 00:39:14,790
I hear you got Shaun off scut

816
00:39:14,824 --> 00:39:16,325
and back into surgery.

817
00:39:16,358 --> 00:39:19,929
I heard you tried.

818
00:39:19,962 --> 00:39:21,163
You're welcome.

819
00:39:23,265 --> 00:39:24,900
Just a friendly warning...

820
00:39:24,934 --> 00:39:27,903
I know you have no interest
in helping Shaun.

821
00:39:27,937 --> 00:39:29,939
You figure you'll give him
a little authority,

822
00:39:29,972 --> 00:39:31,073
he'll screw something up,

823
00:39:31,106 --> 00:39:32,675
and then you'll be done with him,

824
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:34,910
and then you'll be done with me.

825
00:39:34,944 --> 00:39:36,979
You're right about me.

826
00:39:37,012 --> 00:39:39,081
I am getting old

827
00:39:39,114 --> 00:39:42,251
and maybe a little emotional.

828
00:39:42,284 --> 00:39:46,021
Maybe I over-committed.

829
00:39:46,055 --> 00:39:47,690
But you're wrong about Shaun.

830
00:39:47,723 --> 00:39:51,226
He's gonna handle anything
you throw at him.

831
00:39:52,394 --> 00:39:55,330
Either way, if he succeeds,

832
00:39:55,364 --> 00:39:56,799
I'm the guy who just backed him.

833
00:39:56,832 --> 00:40:00,102
And if he fails, I'm the president.

834
00:40:18,453 --> 00:40:20,389
Everything went great.

835
00:40:20,422 --> 00:40:22,224
Thank you. Thank you.

836
00:40:22,257 --> 00:40:24,293
Thank you. There were complications...

837
00:40:24,326 --> 00:40:27,129
But I'm okay? Yeah, but the surgery...

838
00:40:27,162 --> 00:40:28,263
I don't care.

839
00:40:28,297 --> 00:40:30,933
You saved me. Thank you.

840
00:40:30,966 --> 00:40:32,735
My son's going to be here soon.

841
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,369
I told him you said it would be okay,

842
00:40:34,403 --> 00:40:36,271
but he flew in anyway.

843
00:40:36,305 --> 00:40:39,141
You saved me.

844
00:40:41,844 --> 00:40:44,413
You're gonna be a beautiful
mother of the groom.

845
00:41:09,905 --> 00:41:11,373
Go on and take a bow.

846
00:41:11,406 --> 00:41:13,175
You've earned it.

847
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:16,111
Why does it matter who gets credit?

848
00:41:16,145 --> 00:41:20,282
It matters because
the people who get credit,

849
00:41:20,315 --> 00:41:22,151
they don't have to do scut work.

850
00:41:32,895 --> 00:41:36,365
Dr. Murphy, thank you so much.
<i>Feel its heartbeat</i>

851
00:41:36,398 --> 00:41:39,201
<i>Feel what you heat</i>

852
00:41:39,234 --> 00:41:40,369
Thank you!

853
00:41:40,402 --> 00:41:42,237
<i>Far so fast</i>

854
