00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.909
Mister?

2
00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:50.611
Mister?

3
00:02:25.513 --> 00:02:26.647
Ladies and gentlemen,

4
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.849
welcome to San Jose
International Airport.

5
00:02:55.843 --> 00:03:00.614
Look out! Watch out!

6
00:03:00.648 --> 00:03:01.815
Help!

7
00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.617
Adam?!
Oh, my God!

8
00:03:03.651 --> 00:03:05.219
Adam?!

9
00:03:05.253 --> 00:03:08.356
Somebody call 911!

10
00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:10.558
Oh, my God!

11
00:03:10.591 --> 00:03:14.828
I'm a doctor, let me take a look.
Let me take a look.

12
00:03:14.862 --> 00:03:16.297
His jugular vein's been cut.

13
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.331
Does anyone have a clean cloth?

14
00:03:17.365 --> 00:03:18.332
Please. Someone!

15
00:03:18.366 --> 00:03:19.800
I have a fresh change
of clothes in my bag.

16
00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:20.734
That's great.

17
00:03:30.778 --> 00:03:33.281
You're killing him.

18
00:03:33.314 --> 00:03:35.015
I'm saving his life.
He was bleeding out.

19
00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.917
N-You have it in the wrong place.

20
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.752
I think I remember enough of Anatomy 101

21
00:03:38.786 --> 00:03:40.254
to know where the jugular vein is.

22
00:03:40.288 --> 00:03:42.490
You would be in the right place
if he were an adult.

23
00:03:42.523 --> 00:03:44.458
He's not an adult. He is a boy.

24
00:03:44.492 --> 00:03:46.727
Which means you're also putting
pressure on his trachea.

25
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.831
Which means he's not
currently breathing.

26
00:03:50.864 --> 00:03:53.767
You have to put the pressure higher up.

27
00:03:57.538 --> 00:03:58.906
There.

28
00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:00.941
Oh.
Oh!

29
00:04:09.717 --> 00:04:12.686
Some glass. He'll be fine.

30
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.422
Who are you?

31
00:04:14.455 --> 00:04:16.824
Hello. I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

32
00:04:16.857 --> 00:04:17.991
I'm a surgical resident

33
00:04:18.025 --> 00:04:20.328
at San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital.

34
00:04:31.872 --> 00:04:35.075
Autism... a mental condition
characterized by difficulty

35
00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:39.413
in communicating and using
language and abstract concepts.

36
00:04:39.447 --> 00:04:40.914
That's the definition.

37
00:04:40.948 --> 00:04:43.384
Does it sound like
I'm describing a surgeon?

38
00:04:43.417 --> 00:04:45.486
He's not Rain Man.

39
00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:47.955
He's high functioning,
he's capable of living on his own,

40
00:04:47.988 --> 00:04:50.558
capable of managing his own affairs.

41
00:04:50.591 --> 00:04:52.526
"High functioning"?

42
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.728
Is that our new hiring standard?

43
00:04:54.762 --> 00:04:55.929
If it were, you wouldn't be here.

44
00:04:55.963 --> 00:04:59.099
I'm sorry.
Is this really necessary? Really?

45
00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:01.535
A special meeting
of the Board of Directors...

46
00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:03.671
as much as I love you all...

47
00:05:03.704 --> 00:05:06.073
questioning one of my hiring decisions?

48
00:05:06.106 --> 00:05:08.409
Did you bother to look up
the definition of "President"

49
00:05:08.442 --> 00:05:09.810
while you were skimming the dictionary?

50
00:05:09.843 --> 00:05:12.746
You're hiring him to be
a surgical resident...

51
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.416
my department... over my objections.

52
00:05:15.616 --> 00:05:16.616
Gentlemen!

53
00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:18.918
Marcus,
stop making everything so personal.

54
00:05:18.951 --> 00:05:20.119
I made it personal?

55
00:05:20.152 --> 00:05:21.754
You've wanted his job since day one.

56
00:05:21.788 --> 00:05:22.955
Everyone in this room knows that.

57
00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:25.291
And, Aaron, yes, this is your hospital.

58
00:05:25.324 --> 00:05:26.125
But the money it takes to run it

59
00:05:26.158 --> 00:05:28.060
comes from the Foundation I control.

60
00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:30.863
So let's all play nice, shall we?

61
00:05:30.897 --> 00:05:32.932
Stop acting like you're stunned
that you're standing there.

62
00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:34.200
You tried to slip one past us.

63
00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:36.747
I personally spoke with all his professors.

64
00:05:36.947 --> 00:05:39.637
I vetted him like I would
any other candidate.

65
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.271
And you genuinely thought
that this Board

66
00:05:41.305 --> 00:05:43.207
wouldn't reasonably
have any doubts about

67
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.645
hiring a surgeon who's been
diagnosed with autism?

68
00:05:47.678 --> 00:05:49.580
So justify your decision.

69
00:05:52.516 --> 00:05:55.619
I met Shaun Murphy
when he was 14 years old.

70
00:05:55.652 --> 00:05:58.222
I was living in Wyoming at the time.

71
00:05:58.255 --> 00:06:02.159
He was, and he still is,
an extraordinary young man.

72
00:06:02.192 --> 00:06:06.296
Yes, he is autistic. Yes, he has autism.
but he also has savant syndrome...

73
00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.198
genius-level skills in several areas.

74
00:06:09.232 --> 00:06:13.002
He has almost perfect recall.
He has spatial intelligence.

75
00:06:13.036 --> 00:06:16.940
And he sees things
and analyzes things in ways

76
00:06:16.973 --> 00:06:18.942
that... that are just remarkable.

77
00:06:18.975 --> 00:06:21.978
In ways that we can't
even begin to understand.

78
00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:24.614
Those are assets. Those are benefits.

79
00:06:24.648 --> 00:06:29.251
Undeniable assets for any doctor
 particularly a surgeon.

80
00:06:31.586 --> 00:06:34.522
You've known him since he was 14?

81
00:06:34.556 --> 00:06:36.691
You care about him.
He's like a son to you.

82
00:06:36.724 --> 00:06:39.827
Dr. Andrews, your wife is gonna
be very upset with you.

83
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:41.663
If you're trying to turn this
into a nepotism case,

84
00:06:41.696 --> 00:06:44.432
we're gonna have to fire her
idiot nephew from bookkeeping.

85
00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:53.574
Hey!

86
00:06:53.607 --> 00:06:54.808
Sorry. You seen Claire?

87
00:06:54.841 --> 00:06:56.143
Would you turn off the light?

88
00:06:56.177 --> 00:06:57.278
Sure. You seen Claire?

89
00:06:57.311 --> 00:06:59.480
Why? Would you turn off the light?

90
00:06:59.513 --> 00:07:01.282
Melendez wants to operate on 104,

91
00:07:01.315 --> 00:07:03.284
but Claire hasn't gotten
informed consent.

92
00:07:03.317 --> 00:07:05.686
And she's ignoring her page.
You seen her?

93
00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:07.754
No. Now go away and turn off the light.

94
00:07:07.788 --> 00:07:10.557
Sure.

95
00:07:16.963 --> 00:07:18.732
They need you to, um...

96
00:07:18.765 --> 00:07:20.767
I heard.

97
00:07:22.936 --> 00:07:24.705
Oh, she's such a bitch.

98
00:07:25.939 --> 00:07:27.841
No.

99
00:07:27.874 --> 00:07:29.710
She just doesn't like you.

100
00:07:29.743 --> 00:07:33.447
Hmm.

101
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.380
Are we supposed to be
getting a new resident?

102
00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.780
You know, someone to
get Consents while we sleep.

103
00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.682
It's kind of silly, isn't it?

104
00:07:39.716 --> 00:07:42.785
Um, maybe.

105
00:07:42.819 --> 00:07:44.053
To say for sure, I'd need to know

106
00:07:44.086 --> 00:07:45.788
what it is you're talking about.

107
00:07:45.822 --> 00:07:47.156
Us.

108
00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:50.392
Ah. Hmm. Not silly at all.

109
00:07:50.426 --> 00:07:52.094
Quite a bit of fun, actually.

110
00:07:52.128 --> 00:07:55.397
I meant that we're hiding it.
Our relationship.

111
00:07:55.431 --> 00:07:59.068
Hmm. Well...

112
00:07:59.101 --> 00:08:02.872
Jared, we don't have a relationship.

113
00:08:02.905 --> 00:08:05.441
We have sex.

114
00:08:05.474 --> 00:08:08.711
But, if you want to tell people

115
00:08:08.745 --> 00:08:14.316
that you're screwing me, go for it.

116
00:08:38.374 --> 00:08:40.476
The veins in the boy's
left arm are popping.

117
00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:41.811
Is that bad?

118
00:08:41.844 --> 00:08:42.979
I-I don't see.

119
00:08:43.012 --> 00:08:44.446
Intrathoracic pressure.

120
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.315
No, his chest is rising. He's breathing.

121
00:08:46.348 --> 00:08:49.819
No, the...
the chest is moving paradoxically.

122
00:08:49.852 --> 00:08:51.487
The left lung is in distress.

123
00:08:58.995 --> 00:09:02.364
Yes.

124
00:09:02.398 --> 00:09:08.805
Who here has a sharp knife,
blade five inches or longer?

125
00:09:08.838 --> 00:09:10.039
Nobody?

126
00:09:10.072 --> 00:09:11.841
You should start artificial respiration.

127
00:09:11.874 --> 00:09:14.476
He's going to stop breathing very soon.

128
00:09:19.215 --> 00:09:20.215
How are you feeling?

129
00:09:20.415 --> 00:09:22.517
I feel fine.
Dr. Melendez would like

130
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:24.685
to do the surgery today.

131
00:09:24.719 --> 00:09:27.822
You need bypass surgery quite urgently.

132
00:09:27.855 --> 00:09:30.691
Would you please sign the consent?

133
00:09:30.725 --> 00:09:31.992
No.

134
00:09:32.026 --> 00:09:33.394
You're scared.

135
00:09:33.428 --> 00:09:34.662
I-I'm not scared.

136
00:09:34.695 --> 00:09:35.430
Well, you should be.

137
00:09:35.463 --> 00:09:36.564
We're gonna cut your chest open,

138
00:09:36.597 --> 00:09:39.967
we're gonna stop your heart,
repair it and restart it.

139
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.570
Are you seriously telling me
that that doesn't scare you?

140
00:09:42.603 --> 00:09:44.639
I just want a second opinion.

141
00:09:44.672 --> 00:09:48.609
Callum, yesterday,
your life was perfect.

142
00:09:48.643 --> 00:09:51.579
You were playing tennis,
you had a big anniversary.

143
00:09:51.612 --> 00:09:53.781
Today, you're lying in a hospital bed

144
00:09:53.814 --> 00:09:56.016
trying to figure out
the best way to say goodbye,

145
00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:59.454
maybe forever, to your teenage children.

146
00:09:59.487 --> 00:10:00.821
Why are you doing this?

147
00:10:00.855 --> 00:10:04.024
Because I can't deal with lies.

148
00:10:04.058 --> 00:10:07.395
If you lie to me,
my answers won't help you.

149
00:10:07.428 --> 00:10:11.999
But, if you're scared, I can help you.

150
00:10:14.902 --> 00:10:16.437
I'm scared.

151
00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:18.406
Okay.

152
00:10:21.742 --> 00:10:23.878
You can't be back here.
Oh, I need a knife.

153
00:10:23.911 --> 00:10:25.045
Where do you keep the knives

154
00:10:25.079 --> 00:10:26.747
people forget they're traveling with?

155
00:10:26.781 --> 00:10:29.116
A knife? Sure. Anything else?

156
00:10:29.149 --> 00:10:32.887
I do also need a narrow six-foot tube

157
00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.489
and high-proof alcohol and gloves

158
00:10:34.522 --> 00:10:36.591
and baggage-handling tape,
but I am going to get

159
00:10:36.624 --> 00:10:37.925
the alcohol from the duty-free store

160
00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.827
and the tube from
the back of a soda machine.

161
00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.596
Well, I wish you all the luck with that.

162
00:10:41.629 --> 00:10:42.597
But I'm not gonna give you a knife.

163
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:45.132
No, I need a knife.
It-It's... It's very...

164
00:10:45.165 --> 00:10:48.603
There is a medical emergency.
There's a medical emergency.

165
00:10:48.636 --> 00:10:51.739
That one. That one,
right near the top, looks very sharp.

166
00:10:51.772 --> 00:10:52.873
Would you get it for me?

167
00:10:52.907 --> 00:10:54.509
No, I'm not gonna give you a knife.

168
00:10:54.542 --> 00:10:57.745
I'll ask... There's not the time.

169
00:10:57.778 --> 00:11:00.381
Weapon! Weapon!

170
00:11:01.749 --> 00:11:03.884
Move! Get out of the way!

171
00:11:06.587 --> 00:11:08.723
Drop it.

172
00:11:08.756 --> 00:11:11.091
You idiot!
You're lucky we didn't just shoot.

173
00:11:11.125 --> 00:11:14.629
No! He's trying to save my son's life.

174
00:11:22.102 --> 00:11:24.004
You get that consent on 104?

175
00:11:24.038 --> 00:11:25.740
Well, I made him a deal.

176
00:11:25.773 --> 00:11:28.876
He's got a meeting with
Dr. Max from psychiatry at 6:00,

177
00:11:28.909 --> 00:11:30.144
we'll get the consent by 8:00,

178
00:11:30.177 --> 00:11:32.413
we can operate first thing
in the morning.

179
00:11:32.447 --> 00:11:33.881
You did pass anatomy, right, Dr. Browne?

180
00:11:33.914 --> 00:11:35.550
His problem's in his heart,
not his head.

181
00:11:35.583 --> 00:11:37.452
He's not psychologically
ready for surgery.

182
00:11:37.485 --> 00:11:38.586
He will be. Soon.

183
00:11:38.619 --> 00:11:39.887
Well, he is physically ready.

184
00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.889
So, get the consent.
We're prepping O.R. 6 now.

185
00:11:41.922 --> 00:11:44.191
Do I need to cite you
the 17 studies that show

186
00:11:44.224 --> 00:11:45.960
a correlation between
attitude and outcome

187
00:11:45.993 --> 00:11:46.994
in surgical patients?

188
00:11:47.027 --> 00:11:50.965
Do I need to remind you
that I am your superior?

189
00:11:50.998 --> 00:11:55.035
You do know what the opposite
of superior is, right?

190
00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:55.836
Subordinate. Doesn't...

191
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.706
Sure. Subordinate. Or...inferior.

192
00:11:58.739 --> 00:11:59.607
Either way.

193
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.141
It doesn't mean I'm wrong.

194
00:12:01.175 --> 00:12:03.143
I suppose not.

195
00:12:03.177 --> 00:12:08.549
But it does mean you have
to act like you're wrong.

196
00:12:08.583 --> 00:12:09.917
He's panic stricken.

197
00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:11.952
Yesterday, he was young and healthy.

198
00:12:11.986 --> 00:12:13.488
Today, he's mortal.

199
00:12:13.521 --> 00:12:16.156
Just give him a chance
to wrap his head around that.

200
00:12:21.128 --> 00:12:23.731
Dr. Kalu?

201
00:12:23.764 --> 00:12:24.899
Do you think you can get me

202
00:12:24.932 --> 00:12:28.603
a signed informed consent on 104?

203
00:12:28.636 --> 00:12:29.470
Of course.

204
00:12:29.504 --> 00:12:31.506
Thank you.

205
00:12:34.174 --> 00:12:36.143
You think he's right?

206
00:12:36.176 --> 00:12:40.214
I think he's my boss.

207
00:12:40.247 --> 00:12:43.751
And if I have to choose
between my boss and...

208
00:12:43.784 --> 00:12:46.854
the woman I'm screwing,

209
00:12:46.887 --> 00:12:51.058
not much of a choice, am I right?

210
00:12:55.628 --> 00:12:58.831
Excuse me. Excuse me, please?

211
00:13:46.278 --> 00:13:49.815
The incision should
take place two ribs down.

212
00:14:17.342 --> 00:14:18.911
Okay, well, why the bottle?

213
00:14:18.944 --> 00:14:20.946
The air will continue
to leak and accumulate

214
00:14:20.979 --> 00:14:23.048
until the damage
can be properly repaired.

215
00:14:23.081 --> 00:14:24.249
The tube allows the air to get out.

216
00:14:24.282 --> 00:14:26.885
The water in the bottle stops
the air from coming back in.

217
00:14:26.919 --> 00:14:28.921
A homemade one-way valve.

218
00:14:31.056 --> 00:14:32.825
He's breathing.

219
00:14:34.693 --> 00:14:37.129
You saved his life.

220
00:14:37.162 --> 00:14:38.964
He saved his life!

221
00:14:54.277 --> 00:14:58.646
235 to Seattle,
now departing from Gate B42.

222
00:14:59.979 --> 00:15:02.882
Shaun, where are you? I-I...

223
00:15:03.082 --> 00:15:06.982
It's not like you to be late.
I really need you here.

224
00:15:07.415 --> 00:15:08.583
Call me as soon

225
00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:09.684
as you can, please.

226
00:15:09.717 --> 00:15:11.319
That was a mistake. I agree,

227
00:15:11.353 --> 00:15:13.355
'cause it's not about the new doctor,
this is about you.

228
00:15:13.388 --> 00:15:15.257
They're baiting you.
And you're letting them.

229
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:16.391
Maybe. Maybe what?

230
00:15:16.424 --> 00:15:17.759
What mistake are you talking about?

231
00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:19.227
Your shot at Andrews' nephew.

232
00:15:19.261 --> 00:15:21.163
Oh, come on. It was funny.

233
00:15:21.196 --> 00:15:23.431
It was very funny.
It was also disrespectful.

234
00:15:23.465 --> 00:15:24.366
Well, you don't show him respect.

235
00:15:24.399 --> 00:15:26.434
I assume it's because
you don't respect him.

236
00:15:26.468 --> 00:15:28.303
You show someone respect
because you respect them,

237
00:15:28.336 --> 00:15:29.437
or because you're afraid of them.

238
00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:30.905
I don't fit into either category.

239
00:15:30.938 --> 00:15:32.374
Well, neither do I.

240
00:15:32.407 --> 00:15:34.442
You should.

241
00:15:34.476 --> 00:15:37.179
You're only in that room
because your grandfather

242
00:15:37.212 --> 00:15:40.715
founded this hospital.

243
00:15:40.748 --> 00:15:42.450
I'm gonna pretend that this conversation

244
00:15:42.484 --> 00:15:44.552
didn't take this tangent,
and instead focus on something

245
00:15:44.586 --> 00:15:47.422
relevant... the debate you are losing.

246
00:15:47.455 --> 00:15:48.590
Here's how you win this.

247
00:15:48.623 --> 00:15:51.593
You don't make it personal.
You do not make it about you.

248
00:15:51.626 --> 00:15:54.162
That is what they want,
and if you give it to them,

249
00:15:54.196 --> 00:15:57.265
you will lose.

250
00:16:00.334 --> 00:16:03.704
I need to get to San Jose
St. Bonaventure Hospital.

251
00:16:03.737 --> 00:16:04.871
That's where we're going.

252
00:16:04.905 --> 00:16:06.507
Good.

253
00:16:12.946 --> 00:16:14.415
How hard can it be

254
00:16:14.448 --> 00:16:16.683
to just act like a normal human being?!

255
00:16:16.717 --> 00:16:18.885
He doesn't know how.
Bull!

256
00:16:18.919 --> 00:16:20.854
What are we supposed to do now? Huh?

257
00:16:20.887 --> 00:16:22.956
This is the third school
he's been thrown out of.

258
00:16:22.989 --> 00:16:23.890
We'll find another school.

259
00:16:23.924 --> 00:16:25.892
No, we won't,
'cause nothing's gonna change.

260
00:16:25.926 --> 00:16:28.229
They can't handle him,
and I don't blame them,

261
00:16:28.262 --> 00:16:29.830
'cause obviously,
we can't handle him, either.

262
00:16:29.863 --> 00:16:31.365
What the hell happened this time?

263
00:16:31.398 --> 00:16:32.899
What happened?!

264
00:16:32.933 --> 00:16:33.967
You're hurting him.

265
00:16:36.737 --> 00:16:38.305
What did you do?!

266
00:16:38.339 --> 00:16:40.274
Shaun! No!

267
00:16:40.307 --> 00:16:42.309
Will you stop petting
that stupid rabbit?!

268
00:16:54.988 --> 00:16:57.524
It changed.

269
00:16:57.558 --> 00:17:00.761
The boy's ECG changed.

270
00:17:00.794 --> 00:17:03.364
It's the same... 86 BPM.

271
00:17:03.397 --> 00:17:05.566
No. It used to be higher.

272
00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:07.934
No, it used to be 86. It's still 86.

273
00:17:07.968 --> 00:17:11.004
It used to come up to here.

274
00:17:11.037 --> 00:17:15.276
Lower amplitude means lower voltage.

275
00:17:15.309 --> 00:17:16.743
What's going on? What does it mean?

276
00:17:16.777 --> 00:17:18.745
It means he's trying to read
20-year-old equipment

277
00:17:18.779 --> 00:17:20.981
while traveling in a vehicle
going 40 miles an hour.

278
00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:24.984
How did you get him to sign?
Did you threaten him?

279
00:17:25.084 --> 00:17:25.718
Of course not!

280
00:17:25.918 --> 00:17:28.453
I simply told him it was either
consenting or going home,

281
00:17:28.787 --> 00:17:33.525
then I gave him two forms
and told him to pick one.

282
00:17:33.558 --> 00:17:35.427
And you highlighted the Release Against

283
00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:36.795
Medical Advice form that mentions

284
00:17:36.828 --> 00:17:39.364
the "possibility of death
or permanent disability"?

285
00:17:39.798 --> 00:17:41.100
Well done.

286
00:17:41.133 --> 00:17:42.701
Hand me the Metz and a pick-up.

287
00:17:42.734 --> 00:17:44.269
I'm isolating the descending aorta.

288
00:17:44.303 --> 00:17:47.339
Vascular clamp.

289
00:17:47.372 --> 00:17:48.773
What is that?

290
00:17:48.807 --> 00:17:50.375
Under the left atrium...

291
00:17:50.409 --> 00:17:52.844
something white.

292
00:17:52.877 --> 00:17:55.647
Is that part of the lung?

293
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.350
It's pus.

294
00:17:59.383 --> 00:18:00.484
Did he have TB?

295
00:18:00.518 --> 00:18:01.419
No, he doesn't have any...

296
00:18:01.452 --> 00:18:02.786
No, not currently.
Does he have a history...

297
00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:03.822
When he was younger,
he was exposed to...

298
00:18:03.405 --> 00:18:04.506
This is an abscess. It's gonna bur...

299
00:18:06.375 --> 00:18:08.677
Suction and a lap sponge.
His BP's crashing.

300
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:10.044
Two liters saline wide open.

301
00:18:10.078 --> 00:18:12.847
Set up the level one.
Two units packed cells now.

302
00:18:12.881 --> 00:18:15.584
Get Levophed on board
and keep that MAP at 60.

303
00:18:15.617 --> 00:18:17.619
Get in there with the suction.
I can't see a damn thing.

304
00:18:17.652 --> 00:18:19.821
Suction.

305
00:18:19.854 --> 00:18:21.490
I hope it isn't too upsetting
to him when he hears

306
00:18:21.523 --> 00:18:22.791
he would have died in his room

307
00:18:22.824 --> 00:18:24.593
if we'd waited until tomorrow.

308
00:18:24.626 --> 00:18:27.061
Dr. Melendez,
we've got an incoming 8-year-old male,

309
00:18:27.095 --> 00:18:28.530
pneumothorax stabilized,

310
00:18:28.563 --> 00:18:30.365
but undetermined internal injuries.

311
00:18:30.399 --> 00:18:31.533
Who do you want to catch?

312
00:18:31.566 --> 00:18:33.502
Claire, I don't think we need you.

313
00:18:33.535 --> 00:18:36.771
This patient is gonna be fine...now.

314
00:18:39.508 --> 00:18:40.575
8-year-old healthy boy,

315
00:18:40.609 --> 00:18:42.577
status post encounter with
a shattered glass sign.

316
00:18:42.611 --> 00:18:43.745
Numerous lacerations.

317
00:18:43.778 --> 00:18:45.814
Echo...
Get him set up in Trauma 3

318
00:18:45.847 --> 00:18:48.082
with an EKG,
full blood work and a pan-scan.

319
00:18:49.116 --> 00:18:51.118
We need an echo-echocardiogram.

320
00:18:51.151 --> 00:18:52.019
Who is this guy?

321
00:18:52.052 --> 00:18:53.821
He helped with first-aid at the airport.

322
00:18:53.854 --> 00:18:56.056
I'm the doctor.
He needs an echocardiogram.

323
00:18:56.089 --> 00:18:57.591
Where are you taking him? To surgery.

324
00:18:57.625 --> 00:18:59.727
All cardiac vital signs
are within normal range.

325
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:00.594
Do you have any I.D.?

326
00:19:00.628 --> 00:19:02.796
No. His... His heart. It's his heart.

327
00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:04.798
His heart is fine. Now stay here.

328
00:19:04.832 --> 00:19:06.567
Adam needs an echocardiogram.

329
00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.737
No. Behave yourself.
Or you'll be removed from the building.

330
00:19:21.582 --> 00:19:23.150
Echo. Echo.

331
00:19:38.723 --> 00:19:40.292
What's that?

332
00:19:40.325 --> 00:19:41.526
A one-way valve.

333
00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:46.031
And he reports the boy
suffered a pneumothorax.

334
00:19:46.065 --> 00:19:48.300
That is cool.

335
00:19:54.573 --> 00:19:57.142
Do you think we should
do an echocardiogram?

336
00:19:57.176 --> 00:19:59.011
Based on the presenting symptoms,
which give

337
00:19:59.044 --> 00:20:01.513
no indication that
an echocardiogram is necessary,

338
00:20:01.546 --> 00:20:04.349
I'm going to answer no.

339
00:20:04.383 --> 00:20:05.650
Am I missing something?

340
00:20:05.684 --> 00:20:07.719
No, sir.

341
00:20:07.752 --> 00:20:09.154
Knife.

342
00:20:58.203 --> 00:21:01.373
We don't normally
treat rabbits, especially...

343
00:21:01.406 --> 00:21:03.742
This was the closest doctor place,
and it was an emergency.

344
00:21:03.775 --> 00:21:04.743
No, I can see that.

345
00:21:04.776 --> 00:21:10.249
But even if I was a vet,
the rabbit...is dead.

346
00:21:12.484 --> 00:21:15.487
I'm sorry, guys.

347
00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:20.025
Everything smells
different when it rains.

348
00:21:20.059 --> 00:21:22.794
What do we do now?

349
00:21:22.827 --> 00:21:26.765
Well, you should bury him, I guess.

350
00:21:26.798 --> 00:21:29.701
I don't know, give him a...
a nice funeral.

351
00:21:29.734 --> 00:21:32.637
Has he gone to heaven?

352
00:21:36.408 --> 00:21:39.044
Yeah, sure. Uh, sure...
sure, he has. Um...

353
00:21:39.078 --> 00:21:42.281
No, I don't want him to go to heaven!
I want him to be here!

354
00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:46.818
This won't happen again.

355
00:21:46.851 --> 00:21:49.321
It can't happen again. He's dead.

356
00:21:49.354 --> 00:21:50.522
I know that.

357
00:21:50.555 --> 00:21:53.125
I mean, nothing like this
is ever going to happen to us,

358
00:21:53.158 --> 00:21:54.426
ever again.

359
00:21:54.459 --> 00:21:57.296
Because we're not going home.

360
00:21:57.329 --> 00:21:59.731
We're never going home again.

361
00:21:59.764 --> 00:22:02.167
We have each other,
and that's all we need.

362
00:22:11.676 --> 00:22:14.213
A surgeon needs to communicate...

363
00:22:14.246 --> 00:22:19.518
not just information,
but sympathy, empathy.

364
00:22:19.551 --> 00:22:23.020
Can Dr. Murphy do that?
Can he do that under stress?
Can he do that,

365
00:22:23.055 --> 00:22:26.255
knowing that a human life
literally hangs in the balance?

366
00:22:27.353 --> 00:22:31.390
He can't even reliably show up
for a job interview.

367
00:22:31.424 --> 00:22:33.259
Are you gonna sit here
and tell us that there were

368
00:22:33.292 --> 00:22:38.531
no other equally-qualified
young surgeons...

369
00:22:38.564 --> 00:22:42.568
surgeons without this one's...issues?

370
00:22:42.601 --> 00:22:43.702
No.

371
00:22:43.736 --> 00:22:47.874
Which is why... exactly why...
we should hire Shaun.

372
00:22:47.907 --> 00:22:50.376
We should hire him
because he is qualified

373
00:22:50.409 --> 00:22:52.545
and because he is different.

374
00:22:52.578 --> 00:22:54.347
How long ago was it
that we wouldn't hire

375
00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:56.282
black doctors in this hospital?

376
00:22:56.315 --> 00:22:58.317
How m-How long ago was it
that we wouldn't hire

377
00:22:58.351 --> 00:23:01.187
female doctors at this hospital?

378
00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:04.090
So,
you're comparing being African-American

379
00:23:04.123 --> 00:23:06.492
or a woman with being autistic.

380
00:23:06.525 --> 00:23:08.527
Please, go on...

381
00:23:08.561 --> 00:23:12.565
Okay.

382
00:23:12.598 --> 00:23:15.869
The rationalization is exactly the same.

383
00:23:15.902 --> 00:23:19.438
Words like "temperament" and, "Oh, no!
Ohh!

384
00:23:19.472 --> 00:23:21.474
How are the patients going to react?"

385
00:23:21.507 --> 00:23:23.609
Aren't we judged by how we treat people?

386
00:23:23.642 --> 00:23:27.146
I don't mean as doctors.
I mean as people.

387
00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:28.882
Especially those who... who don't have

388
00:23:28.915 --> 00:23:30.950
the same advantages that we have.

389
00:23:30.984 --> 00:23:33.920
We hire Shaun,
and we give hope to those people

390
00:23:33.953 --> 00:23:35.588
with limitations that those limitations

391
00:23:35.621 --> 00:23:38.057
are not what they think they are,

392
00:23:38.091 --> 00:23:41.194
that they do have a shot!

393
00:23:45.531 --> 00:23:50.436
We hire Shaun,
and we make this hospital better for it.

394
00:23:50.469 --> 00:23:54.908
We hire Shaun,
and we are better people for it.

395
00:23:54.941 --> 00:23:58.444
We'd be "better people,"

396
00:23:58.477 --> 00:24:03.316
spending a lot more on
malpractice insurance.

397
00:24:03.349 --> 00:24:05.252
How old is this kid again?
8.

398
00:24:05.295 --> 00:24:07.272
Be careful to inspect
the recurrent laryngial.

399
00:24:07.472 --> 00:24:09.185
It's often damaged in surgical trauma.

400
00:24:09.285 --> 00:24:11.554
Sponge stick.

401
00:24:18.427 --> 00:24:20.362
What was his heart rate
five minutes ago?

402
00:24:20.395 --> 00:24:21.596
Uh, 86.

403
00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:22.564
You sure?

404
00:24:22.597 --> 00:24:25.600
Certain. He's been a rock.
It's barely changed.

405
00:24:25.634 --> 00:24:29.004
No, something's changed.
Something's different.

406
00:24:33.036 --> 00:24:35.345
Irrigation over the splenic artery.

407
00:24:35.545 --> 00:24:36.336
Exceptional.

408
00:24:40.575 --> 00:24:41.909
You asked earlier about an echo.

409
00:24:41.943 --> 00:24:44.879
You had no medical reason,
but you asked anyway. Why?

410
00:24:44.912 --> 00:24:47.048
There was this weird guy,
the one that did

411
00:24:47.081 --> 00:24:48.983
the one-way valve, he kept insisting

412
00:24:49.016 --> 00:24:50.952
that the boy needed an echocardiogram.

413
00:24:50.985 --> 00:24:52.153
He didn't say why?

414
00:24:52.186 --> 00:24:54.522
H-He was really weird.

415
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:58.192
His blood pressure's dropping.
That makes no sense.

416
00:24:58.225 --> 00:25:01.829
He's not bleeding anymore.
Everything's under control.

417
00:25:01.863 --> 00:25:03.164
Do an echo.

418
00:25:03.197 --> 00:25:05.199
Sir, the boy is wide open.
It's gonna take awhile.

419
00:25:05.232 --> 00:25:06.834
Good. That'll give me time to figure out

420
00:25:06.868 --> 00:25:08.436
why the hell we're doing an echo.

421
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:09.303
Dr. Browne, you're with me.

422
00:25:09.336 --> 00:25:10.705
We're gonna go find your weird guy.

423
00:25:10.738 --> 00:25:13.541
Keep him stable.

424
00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:18.012
Why the echo?

425
00:25:19.086 --> 00:25:19.935
The boy you ran in.

426
00:25:20.135 --> 00:25:22.012
The boy you think needs an echocardiogram.

427
00:25:22.212 --> 00:25:23.412
Yes, for his heart.

428
00:25:23.516 --> 00:25:25.327
Obviously it's for his heart.

429
00:25:25.427 --> 00:25:27.312
That's what echocardiograms are for. Why?

430
00:25:28.745 --> 00:25:32.283
Yes, ok, ok. Uh...

431
00:25:33.987 --> 00:25:37.656
Okay. I understand you think
he needs an echocardiogram.

432
00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:40.226
We just don't know why.

433
00:25:40.259 --> 00:25:43.062
Well, I-I noticed that
there was a slight reduction

434
00:25:43.096 --> 00:25:45.131
in the intensity
of the electrocardiogram.

435
00:25:45.164 --> 00:25:47.166
The electrical flow...
I noticed that, too.

436
00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.036
The heart rate was the same,
but the amplitude dropped.

437
00:25:50.069 --> 00:25:51.370
Pericardial effusion.

438
00:25:51.404 --> 00:25:52.705
Reduced cardiac output.

439
00:25:52.738 --> 00:25:54.340
Would stress other organs.

440
00:25:54.373 --> 00:25:55.608
Causing them to shut down.

441
00:25:55.641 --> 00:25:57.276
Yes.

442
00:25:59.212 --> 00:26:00.546
Hold on.

443
00:26:00.579 --> 00:26:02.715
Yeah, we're coming right back up...

444
00:26:02.748 --> 00:26:05.118
Thank you.

445
00:26:05.151 --> 00:26:07.320
They did the echo. It's normal.

446
00:26:07.353 --> 00:26:08.521
No pericardial effusion.

447
00:26:08.554 --> 00:26:11.457
No. It has to be. There...
There is no other explanation.

448
00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:15.261
The echo is normal,
which means we just wasted our time.

449
00:26:15.294 --> 00:26:18.031
N-No.

450
00:26:27.573 --> 00:26:30.476
Okay, um, hey, come with me.

451
00:26:30.509 --> 00:26:34.013
Come on.

452
00:26:50.291 --> 00:26:52.694
Show them.

453
00:27:00.935 --> 00:27:02.737
Again.

454
00:27:06.875 --> 00:27:11.913
Again.

455
00:27:11.946 --> 00:27:13.147
There.

456
00:27:13.181 --> 00:27:15.116
Looks normal to me.

457
00:27:15.149 --> 00:27:16.751
It's not normal.

458
00:27:16.785 --> 00:27:19.120
There's a concave deformity
in the right atrium.

459
00:27:19.153 --> 00:27:20.955
Um, no, there's not.

460
00:27:20.989 --> 00:27:23.257
Yeah. Yes, there is. It's very subtle.

461
00:27:23.457 --> 00:27:25.957
Blood must be...
How many echos have you reviewed?

462
00:27:26.657 --> 00:27:27.657
Six.

463
00:27:27.857 --> 00:27:30.657
Well, I've seen approximately
a thousand more than that.

464
00:27:30.791 --> 00:27:31.825
And even if you are right,

465
00:27:31.858 --> 00:27:35.062
that's not where a pericardial
effusion manifests.

466
00:27:37.398 --> 00:27:40.201
Not usually.

467
00:27:40.234 --> 00:27:43.637
But it... it could.

468
00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:47.574
This kid was sprayed with glass
shards... cut his jugular.

469
00:27:47.608 --> 00:27:50.611
What if a piece of glass
entered his blood stream?

470
00:27:50.644 --> 00:27:53.214
It could have traveled
down the jugular vein,

471
00:27:53.247 --> 00:27:55.082
into the brachiocephalic vein

472
00:27:55.116 --> 00:27:56.683
and on to the superior vena cava.

473
00:27:56.717 --> 00:27:59.386
If it punctured the SVC,
blood could be leaking

474
00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:01.222
behind the heart,
restricting the heart's ability

475
00:28:01.255 --> 00:28:03.324
to expand and fill during diastole,

476
00:28:03.357 --> 00:28:04.691
reducing the heart's efficiency.

477
00:28:04.725 --> 00:28:07.828
Lot of ifs there.

478
00:28:12.899 --> 00:28:17.137
Dr. Chen, pair of 14-gauge on a syringe.

479
00:28:21.174 --> 00:28:24.310
All in favor of ratifying
Dr. Glassman's decision

480
00:28:24.344 --> 00:28:26.847
in hiring Dr. Shaun Murphy?

481
00:28:30.984 --> 00:28:33.253
All against.

482
00:28:37.156 --> 00:28:38.223
Excuse me.

483
00:28:38.257 --> 00:28:39.692
Is this a medical emergency?

484
00:28:39.725 --> 00:28:40.793
No. No medical emergency...

485
00:28:40.826 --> 00:28:41.994
Then you weren't
supposed to interrupt...

486
00:28:42.027 --> 00:28:44.263
Yes, I know, but you need to go online.

487
00:28:44.296 --> 00:28:46.131
What? What site?
Pretty much any of them...

488
00:28:46.165 --> 00:28:49.134
Twitter, YouTube, any local news site.

489
00:28:54.206 --> 00:28:56.008
He saved his life!

490
00:29:00.045 --> 00:29:02.748
The YouTube clip already has
over 200,000 views.

491
00:29:02.782 --> 00:29:06.185
Apparently, he's one of our doctors.

492
00:29:06.218 --> 00:29:09.989
Dr. Shaun Murphy saved this boy.

493
00:29:10.022 --> 00:29:12.357
The boy is in OR 2.

494
00:29:12.391 --> 00:29:16.061
Dr. Melendez isn't sure
if he's going to make it.

495
00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:34.042
Your fiancee sure can handle a knife.

496
00:29:34.075 --> 00:29:36.745
Why did you warn me about
respecting Dr. Andrews?

497
00:29:40.882 --> 00:29:42.117
What's going on?

498
00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:44.886
I'm not gonna always
be here to protect you.

499
00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:48.123
You think you're gonna lose?

500
00:29:48.156 --> 00:29:50.325
Everybody loses...

501
00:29:50.358 --> 00:29:52.660
eventually.

502
00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:57.265
Is that your guy?

503
00:30:14.714 --> 00:30:16.683
Can we get a TV?

504
00:30:16.716 --> 00:30:17.917
No.

505
00:30:17.951 --> 00:30:20.554
Why not?

506
00:30:20.587 --> 00:30:22.522
Because we're poor, dude.

507
00:30:22.556 --> 00:30:25.525
We live in a bus.

508
00:30:25.559 --> 00:30:28.695
Do you think Mom is looking for us?

509
00:30:28.728 --> 00:30:30.797
Nope.

510
00:30:33.867 --> 00:30:39.773
She loves us,
but she knows it's better this way.

511
00:30:49.649 --> 00:30:51.551
I got you a present.

512
00:30:51.585 --> 00:30:53.387
It's not my birthday.

513
00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:56.756
I got you a present anyway.

514
00:31:12.772 --> 00:31:14.708
Here.

515
00:31:57.016 --> 00:31:59.553
Kelly.

516
00:32:14.934 --> 00:32:20.440
Dr. Browne...

517
00:32:20.474 --> 00:32:23.643
You were right.

518
00:32:44.127 --> 00:32:46.096
I don't like pickles. I know.

519
00:32:46.129 --> 00:32:49.032
I don't want pickles. And I checked.

520
00:32:51.134 --> 00:32:53.904
You saved that boy's life.

521
00:32:53.937 --> 00:32:55.372
Oh, good.

522
00:32:55.406 --> 00:32:57.374
His name is Adam.

523
00:32:57.408 --> 00:32:59.910
Traumatic pneumothorax.

524
00:32:59.943 --> 00:33:02.446
I'm hungry.

525
00:33:05.416 --> 00:33:08.552
Board reconvenes in 45 minutes.

526
00:33:11.955 --> 00:33:15.859
Can you stay here until I get back?

527
00:33:15.892 --> 00:33:20.831
Okay.

528
00:33:28.572 --> 00:33:30.541
He's got a serious deficit.

529
00:33:30.574 --> 00:33:32.643
A child is alive today
because of that deficit.

530
00:33:32.676 --> 00:33:34.645
And tomorrow,
one may be dead because of it.

531
00:33:34.678 --> 00:33:36.680
I seem to remember that
when I hired you,

532
00:33:36.713 --> 00:33:40.817
you weren't exactly making
the most adult decisions.

533
00:33:40.851 --> 00:33:43.086
You haven't killed anyone yet. Have you?

534
00:33:43.119 --> 00:33:45.589
Well, thankfully,
there's a cure for youth

535
00:33:45.622 --> 00:33:47.858
and stupidity... time and experience.

536
00:33:47.891 --> 00:33:49.926
There's a cure for stupidity?

537
00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.428
Okay.

538
00:33:51.462 --> 00:33:53.430
That would be a windfall.

539
00:33:53.464 --> 00:33:57.133
All Shaun has is a diagnosis.

540
00:33:57.167 --> 00:33:59.436
I'd like your help.

541
00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:03.073
I take it I'm not gonna get it.

542
00:34:03.106 --> 00:34:05.208
Okay.

543
00:34:06.142 --> 00:34:08.078
Wait.

544
00:34:08.111 --> 00:34:09.880
What's the story with this kid?

545
00:34:09.913 --> 00:34:12.082
Why is it so important to you?

546
00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:14.951
Why not?

547
00:34:14.985 --> 00:34:18.121
Because letting things
get personal is a sure formula

548
00:34:18.154 --> 00:34:21.224
for screwing things up.

549
00:34:21.257 --> 00:34:22.593
I don't know.

550
00:34:22.626 --> 00:34:25.729
Letting things get personal is how we...

551
00:34:25.762 --> 00:34:28.865
how we make it matter.

552
00:34:37.007 --> 00:34:40.744
So, are you proud or disappointed?

553
00:34:40.777 --> 00:34:43.113
Do I have to pick just one?

554
00:34:50.053 --> 00:34:54.024
Hey.

555
00:34:54.057 --> 00:34:55.992
You're new to town, right?

556
00:34:56.026 --> 00:34:57.661
Yes.

557
00:34:57.694 --> 00:34:59.796
Well,
I'm sure you have a lot of questions.

558
00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:01.798
No.

559
00:35:01.832 --> 00:35:04.067
Uh...

560
00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:07.671
You got to be curious about the place,
about the people.

561
00:35:07.704 --> 00:35:10.106
Dr. Glassman gave me
a map of the hospital,

562
00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:13.209
and I got a map of San Jose online.

563
00:35:15.311 --> 00:35:17.914
Okay.

564
00:35:17.948 --> 00:35:20.717
Great.

565
00:35:24.154 --> 00:35:26.022
I do have one question.

566
00:35:26.056 --> 00:35:29.526
Yeah?

567
00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.862
Why were you rude to me
when we first met,

568
00:35:31.895 --> 00:35:33.864
then nicer to me the second time we met,

569
00:35:33.897 --> 00:35:36.567
and now you want to be my friend?

570
00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:40.003
Which time was it
that you were pretending?

571
00:35:42.806 --> 00:35:46.309
Shaun. We're ready.

572
00:35:52.983 --> 00:35:56.019
The vote was clear.
Why are we reopening this?

573
00:35:56.052 --> 00:35:57.921
Is it really because
of a piece of publicity?

574
00:35:57.954 --> 00:36:00.056
It's because the man just
saved somebody's life.

575
00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:01.157
And thank God for that,

576
00:36:01.191 --> 00:36:02.893
but it doesn't change
a single thing we discussed.

577
00:36:02.926 --> 00:36:04.194
Give him six months.

578
00:36:04.227 --> 00:36:07.798
If he proves anything
less than excellent...

579
00:36:07.831 --> 00:36:10.200
Someone "less than excellent"
means someone else dies.

580
00:36:10.233 --> 00:36:13.236
Well, I-I would love to make you happy,
Doctor.

581
00:36:13.269 --> 00:36:16.206
I would love to hire someone who never,
ever makes a mistake.

582
00:36:16.239 --> 00:36:19.142
Unfortunately, God already has a job.

583
00:36:19.175 --> 00:36:21.645
I can accept that he will have insights

584
00:36:21.678 --> 00:36:23.714
that none of the rest of us will have.

585
00:36:23.747 --> 00:36:25.281
Can you accept that
he will make mistakes

586
00:36:25.315 --> 00:36:26.617
none of the rest of us will make?

587
00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:29.653
You won't be the one who pays the price.

588
00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:38.762
If Shaun doesn't live up to
everything I know he can do,

589
00:36:38.795 --> 00:36:41.097
he will be immediately released

590
00:36:41.131 --> 00:36:45.769
and I will resign my position
as President of this hospital.

591
00:36:48.104 --> 00:36:50.774
We haven't heard from Dr. Murphy yet.

592
00:36:50.807 --> 00:36:56.112
Perhaps we should hear from him
before we decide his fate.

593
00:36:56.146 --> 00:36:59.149
Shaun...

594
00:37:14.364 --> 00:37:16.933
Dr. Murphy!

595
00:37:17.233 --> 00:37:18.233
Shaun,

596
00:37:18.267 --> 00:37:22.904
I'd like you to tell us why
you want to become a surgeon.

597
00:37:40.855 --> 00:37:42.924
Why do I want them to be my friends?

598
00:37:42.957 --> 00:37:44.893
Everybody needs friends, Shaun.

599
00:37:44.926 --> 00:37:48.296
It's gonna be cool, okay?
Play hide and seek maybe?

600
00:37:48.329 --> 00:37:50.799
Okay. Tag in the warehouse?

601
00:37:56.237 --> 00:37:58.773
Hey, stop following me.

602
00:38:31.305 --> 00:38:32.406
Told ya it was fun, right?

603
00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:34.142
Shh!

604
00:38:40.181 --> 00:38:41.916
Hey, you know what?

605
00:39:19.087 --> 00:39:23.792
The day that the rain
smelled like ice cream,

606
00:39:23.825 --> 00:39:32.233
my bunny went to heaven
in front of my eyes.

607
00:39:32.266 --> 00:39:35.469
The day that the copper pipes
in the old building smelled like

608
00:39:35.503 --> 00:39:42.811
burnt food, my brother...

609
00:39:42.844 --> 00:39:46.380
went to heaven in front of my eyes.

610
00:39:49.383 --> 00:39:52.253
I couldn't save them.

611
00:39:52.286 --> 00:39:56.390
It's sad.

612
00:39:56.424 --> 00:40:01.329
Neither one had the chance
to become an adult.

613
00:40:01.362 --> 00:40:07.168
They should have become adults.

614
00:40:07.201 --> 00:40:10.238
They should have had
children of their own

615
00:40:10.271 --> 00:40:14.408
and loved those children.

616
00:40:18.412 --> 00:40:21.115
And I want to make that possible

617
00:40:21.149 --> 00:40:24.318
for other people.

618
00:40:33.594 --> 00:40:35.596
And I want to make a lot of money

619
00:40:35.629 --> 00:40:40.168
so that I can have a television.

620
00:40:49.077 --> 00:40:54.282
Dr. Murphy...

621
00:40:54.315 --> 00:40:57.451
I want to be the first to welcome you

622
00:40:57.485 --> 00:41:00.855
to San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital.

623
00:41:03.557 --> 00:41:05.927
We're very proud to have you.

624
00:41:16.169 --> 00:41:21.709
Shaun, Dr. Melendez's
team is going into surgery.

625
00:41:21.742 --> 00:41:24.578
I mean, if you're interested.

626
00:42:25.973 --> 00:42:29.042
Got a messy field here.

627
00:42:29.076 --> 00:42:31.479
Murphy.

628
00:42:38.886 --> 00:42:41.589
Suction.

629
00:42:47.094 --> 00:42:49.997
Never forget, you're the smart one.

630
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:52.132
You can do anything.

631
00:42:52.165 --> 00:42:55.536
And I'm proud of you, Shaun.

632
00:43:01.509 --> 00:43:03.511
Bet you've seen many of these.

633
00:43:03.711 --> 00:43:05.811
Hell. you probably imagined even more.

634
00:43:06.579 --> 00:43:09.149
I remember my first.

635
00:43:09.182 --> 00:43:13.420
Kept thinking,
"It doesn't get any better than this."

636
00:43:13.453 --> 00:43:17.024
And for you, I'm afraid,
that's literally true.

637
00:43:19.259 --> 00:43:23.030
You're a nice kid,
and you're obviously very smart,

638
00:43:23.063 --> 00:43:26.133
but you don't belong here.

639
00:43:26.166 --> 00:43:28.101
So, as long as you're part of my team,

640
00:43:28.135 --> 00:43:32.372
this is all you're ever
going to be doing... suction.

641
00:43:36.176 --> 00:43:40.647
I saw a lot of surgeons
in medical school.

642
00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:42.649
You're much better than them.

643
00:43:42.682 --> 00:43:45.218
I have a lot to learn from you.

644
00:43:51.524 --> 00:43:54.694
You're very arrogant.

645
00:43:54.727 --> 00:43:58.731
Do you think that helps you
be a good surgeon?

646
00:43:58.765 --> 00:44:02.669
Does it hurt you as a person?

647
00:44:02.702 --> 00:44:05.372
Is it worth it?
