00:41:15,106 --> 00:41:16,536
His hands
were under my chin,

907
00:41:16,575 --> 00:41:17,805
pulling up the cover,

908
00:41:17,843 --> 00:41:20,053
tucking it around me.

909
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:23,518
'Most people are, Scout,
when you finally see them.'

910
00:41:23,549 --> 00:41:26,749
He turned out the light
and went into Jem's room.

911
00:41:26,785 --> 00:41:28,545
He would be there
all night,

912
00:41:28,587 --> 00:41:32,017
and he would be there when Jem
waked up in the morning."

913
00:41:32,057 --> 00:41:36,997

914
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:39,568
Sounds like a good book.

915
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:41,728
Could've used a spoiler alert,
though.

916
00:41:41,767 --> 00:41:49,037
**

917
00:41:49,074 --> 00:41:51,044
Thank you.

918
00:41:51,076 --> 00:41:55,146
* Confusing you,
from what you need *

919
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:59,150
* Every hand that you hold

920
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:00,854
* It comes back

921
00:42:00,886 --> 00:42:03,116
That's all.

922
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:07,234
* Every word, every ride

923
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:11,798
* It comes back every time

924
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:15,200
**

925
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:19,743
* It comes back every time

926
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:24,881
**

927
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:25,940
* Every time
