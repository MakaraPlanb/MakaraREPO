He's a little too friendly.

I'm sure he's just trying
to establish a rapport.

onto me. Like you did.

I've just been fired for physically
assaulting an employee.

11

So, why do I need to quit my job
to have a family?

Agreed. She can be

a picture here.

to speak with him immediately.

Never make an important
