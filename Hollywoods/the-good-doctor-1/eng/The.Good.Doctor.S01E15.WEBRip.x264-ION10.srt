What happened?
Nothing.

They're just getting the lobby
ready for the big party.

It's an annual fundraiser.

15
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:55,915
Like a carnival?

16
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:59,189
No, it's a swanky,
black-tie ball.

17
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,930
You think a hospital
lobby is swanky?

18
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:04,095
Not yet,
but add some lights,
a few decorations,

19
00:01:04,165 --> 00:01:05,665
and, most importantly,
alcohol...

20
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,973

(SCOFFS)
It's for charity.

23
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,339
Better to spend the money
for the cause.

24
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,807
Actually, it's worse.

25
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,775
You need to spend money
to make money.

00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:18,454
I don't like parties.

27
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:21,182
Doesn't matter.
All residents will be
expected to attend

28
00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:22,919
and make a donation.

00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:24,083
This is Dr. Alex Park.

30
00:01:24,152 --> 00:01:25,352
He's the last
of Coyle's residents

Nice to meet you.

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,330
Welcome back.
How was Costa Rica?

35
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:36,996
Beaches were awesome.
Monkeys were horrible.

Forty-five.

39
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:44,169
That's even older
than Dr. Melendez.

40
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:46,638
DR. MELENDEZ: Dr. Murphy
is a talented doctor
who has autism,

41
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:49,807
which sometimes
causes him to ask
inappropriate questions.

42
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:51,877
No worries.
Inappropriate questions
can be very revealing.

43

I'm a late bloomer.

44
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:56,051
Park's being modest,
which is very unlike him.

45
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,016
He was a cop for 15 years
before he went to med school.

46
00:02:00,388 --> 00:02:02,358
DR. MELENDEZ:
Now that we all
know each other,

00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:07,396
Yes.
Definitely.

to fool around.

I'm not fooling around.

56
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:22,143

with ectopia cordis.
She's been...

80
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,630
Why didn't they repair it
when she was an infant?

81
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,663
They couldn't.
Her rib cage
was too small.

82
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:17,898
But after 14 years
of slow and steady growth...

83
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:19,925
It's time to put this baby
where it belongs.

Oh, it's all right.

I'm sure
you're looking forward

to when there's nothing
to be curious about.

Mm, what I'm really looking
forward to is...crowds.

I've never been in one.

I can't go
to a normal school,

96

and my parents barely ever
let me leave our house.

00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,675
Well, when a small bump
could stop your heart,
it makes sense.

But you still have
a lot of friends?

Yeah, of course.

I mean, I just can't do
anything fun with them.

If you can't
do anything fun,

then how did you get them
to be your friend?

you haven't noticed,

The first thing I'm gonna do
when I get out of here

is take all my friends

as the place is packed.

gonna hug everyone.

00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:43,349
It's just too risky.

feel trapped.

since the transplant.

Yeah, every check-up
this year's been perfect.

00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:04,142
Well, it could just be
a temporary flare-up.

00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:05,614
We'll increase
his anti-rejection meds

128

and do a full liver exam.

129
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:08,007
We'll know more then.

You two,
do the work-up.

131
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:19,688
And you find
a new liver.

132
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,053
Shouldn't we wait
for the biopsy result?

133
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,961
Not when I already know
what it's gonna say.

134
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:25,563
He needs
a new liver ASAP.

135
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:27,086
I mean,
that's gonna be hard.

00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,628
It's gonna be impossible.

to find the first one.

he better get lucky again,

to keep him alive.

from the hospital.

ever once, once

158
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,801
talked about scuba-diving
in an interview.

It doesn't matter
if it's true.

we find a replacement.

a meeting with Aiden Coulter.

Oh, Aiden Coulter?
Yes.

at an A's game.

is that you two

166

were talking smack
that entire game,

167
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,094
and after he spilled
his beer on you

168
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:28,223
and insisted on buying you
a new jacket,

169
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:29,388
you refused him.

170
00:06:29,457 --> 00:06:31,087
So he owes you.

from there.

Huh.

176
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,251
JARED:
You'll be fine.

177
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:53,882
You've had
liver biopsies before.

178
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:56,417
And they've always
hurt a lot.

179
00:06:56,484 --> 00:06:58,454
Please,
isn't there another way?

180
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,619
Well, the other way, Eric,
would going through your neck,

181
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:02,318
and I don't think
you'd like that anymore.

182
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,359
Eric, do you know
why NBA players

183
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,994
all wear headphones
before games?

184
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,659
Don't look at him.
Look at me.

185
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:09,198
I need you to answer me.

186
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,872
Why do NBA players wear
headphones before games?

187
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,532
I don't know.

188
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,171
I guess they like music.

189
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:16,795
No, they need music.

190
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,010
Music helps them forget
about everything else

191
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,512
and focus
on what's important...

192
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:22,684
The game.

193
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,013
Who's your favorite player?

194
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:25,077
Curry.

195
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:26,809
Okay.

196
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,050
This is the song he listens to
before every game.

197
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:32,018
How do you know?

198
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,655
Because he's my favorite
player, too.

199
00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:38,692
I want you to close your eyes
and focus on this.

200
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:39,789
Just this.

201
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,395
It's cold.

202
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,473
Yeah, now it is,
but if you stay focused,

203
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:47,003
pretty soon,
it'll stop feeling cold

204
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,267
and start to feel warm.

205
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:50,235
When that happens,
I want you to nod your head,

206
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,573
and you'll feel some pressure
and a small pinch.

207
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:54,881
What if it does...

208
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:57,442
Then close your eyes
and focus.

209
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:04,276
You ready?

210
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,434
Two minutes
and he'll be good to go.

211
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,099
How'd you know
he was a basketball fan?

212
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,895
His shoes.

213
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:25,411
He's not wearing
any shoes.

214
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:26,942
Yeah, they're in
a backpack in his room.

215
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:30,141
You searched
his backpack?

216
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,380
Well, it's, um,
less invasive
than a rectal,

217
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,276
and most of the time
more useful.

218
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,788
Okay, Spirit,
just keep still and...

219
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,964
And during a few parts
of the exam,

220
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,163
we may ask you
to hold your breath,

221
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:45,894
but it'll only be
a few seconds.

222
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,729
You got it.

223
00:08:47,795 --> 00:08:50,625
(WHIRRING)

224
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:52,668
You gonna buy a tux
or rent one?

225
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,937
The fundraiser
is black tie.

226
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:57,303
I have a suit.

227
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,740
It's new.

228
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:01,436
I bought it
for my resident interviews.

229
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,238
It doesn't matter
how new it is.

230
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,780
It's not a tux.

231
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:08,816
Wearing a uniform at work
reassures patients.

232
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,752
Wearing a uniform
at a party

233
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:13,288
does nothing but make you
hot and uncomfortable.

234
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:15,293
This party is work.

235
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:16,555
Get a tux.

236
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:18,664
And not a crappy one
from some outlet store.

237
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:21,086
Get fitted by a pro and
spend a minimum of two grand.

238
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:23,161
You're gonna meet rich people
who can help your career,

239
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,600
and they're not gonna want
to help some slob in a...

240
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:26,365
I'm not a slob.

241
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,303
No, I am very clean

242
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:30,368
and make sure my clothes
are never wrinkled.

243
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,067
And it's too big.

244
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:35,184
Her heart.

245
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:39,352
It's enlarged 53%
since her last exam.

246
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,347
Her last exam was only
six months ago.

247
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,175
It won't fit.

248
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:46,352
Too big.

249
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,859
The biopsy confirmed
acute cellular rejection.

250
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,762
We maximized his
immuno-suppressives,
but, uh...

251
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:53,164
I found one.
A Type-O liver.

252
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:54,756
Are you sure?

253
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,758
Park and I
checked the registry,
and there weren't any.

254
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,400
I found it online.

255
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,195
He, uh...
He already tried
to make a direct donation

256
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,297
a few months ago,

257
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:03,038
but the patient died
before the surgery.

258
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,943
I contacted him,
which wasn't easy,

259
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:08,036
but he still wants
to be a donor.

260
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,378
That's amazing.

261
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,442
Great job.

262
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:12,711
What's the catch?

263
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,580
He wants to be a donor,
but he's not on the registry?

264
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:16,878
I mean, there's got
to be a catch.

265
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,820
He, uh... He can't
be on the registry

266
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:21,757
because he is in prison.

267
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:24,356
For murder.

268
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:27,294
Actually, um,
seven murders.

269
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:37,496
Boris Tirayan was
a Russian Mafia enforcer
convicted of seven murders.

270
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,270
Who now wants
to make amends.

271
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,039
He tried to be a donor
a few months ago,

272
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:43,738
but the patient died
before the red tape
could be worked out.

273
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:45,511
But now that it has...

274
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,418
Are there any laws against
an inmate becoming a donor?

275
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,921
No, but there is
a ton of liability.

276
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,254
What if he attacks
someone here?

277
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,619
He'll be guarded
by state prison guards

278
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:54,857
on a separate level,

279
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:56,722
away from patients
and all non-essential staff.

280
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,990
Everyone deserves the chance
to turn their life around.

281
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,459
The guy wants
to do something decent,

282
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:01,757
we should let him.

283
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:04,159
I don't think we owe
a murderer anything.

284
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:07,071
But maybe
he owes us something.
He has a debt to society.

285
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:10,704
Which he would repay by
donating his inner organs.

286
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:12,041
Isn't it
a slippery slope

287
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:13,605
between a guy
who wants to make amends

288
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,883
and turning
our prison system

289
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:16,642
into a superstore
for body parts?

290
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,850
A slippery slope that
saves a child's life.

291
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:22,283
It'll never happen.
He's just trying
to get a hospital,

292
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,749
where it'll be
easier to escape.

293
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:26,047
You have no idea
what his motivation is.

294
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,119
I know he's a
lying sociopath

295
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,288
who doesn't care
about anyone but himself.

296
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,656
He's been a model inmate
for nine years.

297
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:33,325
Tutors other prisoners
in the library...

298
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:35,033
Yeah, because he's trying
to get someone to trust him,

299
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:36,955
to give him an inch,
and as soon as they do...

300
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,267
We got approval.

301
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:41,072
He's gonna stall,
make excuses,

302
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,944
and when he sees his chance,
someone's gonna get hurt.

303
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:45,413
I think it's worth
taking that chance.

304
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:48,712
Anybody who doesn't agree,
feel free to sit this one out.

305
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,276
DR. REZNICK:
When you started
menstruating,

306
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:57,217
the increased estrogen
caused pulmonary hypertension,

307
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:59,454
which isn't a surgical issue
in itself,

308
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,589
but along with your
atypical vascular system...

309
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,224
Your heart's
grown too big.

310
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,361
DR. LIM: We will control
your blood pressure

311
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:09,226
so that you will keep growing
but your heart won't,

312
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:10,826
and then,
by the time you're 18,
we'll able to...

313
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:11,928
No.

314
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:13,769
I'm not waiting
any longer.

315
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,104
Spirit, honey,
it will be okay.

316
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,498
No, it won't!

317
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,869
I'm sick of being stuck inside
all the time.

318
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,373
I'm sick of this!

319
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:26,653
I don't ever want to text,
call, or video chat again.

320
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:28,423
Mom,
I want to be touched.

321
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,190
I want to be shoved.

322
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,320
I want to be punched.
I don't even care, just...

323
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:37,419
Please.

324
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,230
Please.

325
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:44,332
I want this surgery now.

326
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:52,171
I need it.

327
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:57,177
I'm sorry.
We can't.

328
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,494
We need to get rid of
all the furniture and artwork.

329
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:09,223
I get removing the paintings,
but the furniture?

330
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,829
Don't want the prison guards
sitting down on the job.

331
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,662
He's gonna be
in full restraints,

332
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:14,856
cuffed to the bed.

333
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,358
Well, that's our plan,

334
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:19,529
but we also need to be
prepared for his plan.

335
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:21,899
Okay, we need to get
rid of the window blinds,
curtain rods,

336
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:23,669
jacket hooks, and make sure
there's no metal rivets

337
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,366
or eyelets
on the mattress.

338
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:27,408
Um, what's he gonna do
with a metal eyelet?

339
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,344
Tear it off the mattress
and file it down

340
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,309
to cut your jugular, or
bend it into a handcuff key,

341
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:33,478
or shove it into
an electric socket

342
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:36,316
to create a spark
and start a fire.

343
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,723
I've seen knives made out of
toilet paper, soap, and salt

344
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:41,686
that could amputate
a fat guy's femur.

345
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,801
Not quite sure he
needed the part about
the guy being fat.

346
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,437
(BOTH LAUGH)

347
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:59,743
So, I've been thinking.

348
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:01,436
You want to go to
the fundraiser together?

349
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,908
It's not a prom.
We don't have to bring a date.

350
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:06,447
Yeah, we don't have to.

351
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,883
But we can,
if we want.

352
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,380
Everyone basically knows
we're seeing each other,

353
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:13,291
but still...

354
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,223
I think it might be
a nice opportunity

355
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:18,658
to take our relationship
out into the open.

356
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,430
Unless
you don't want to.

357
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:24,995
No, it's a good idea.

358
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:26,195
Are you sure?

359
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:27,666
Because, you know,
we don't have to.

360
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,974
Yeah.
Let's do it.

361
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,271
(CELLPHONES CHIME)

362
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:37,382
Let's go.

363
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:38,584
(KNOCKS ON DOOR)

364
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:40,075
What's wrong?

365
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:41,647
WALLACE: It's fine.
He'll be all right.

366
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,324
No, I won't. I don't
want a murderer's liver!

367
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,683
It's evil!

368
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:46,751
(SIGHS) Eric,
there's no such thing

369
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:47,819
as a good
or bad liver.

370
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,987
It's just a...
Just an organ.

371
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:51,987
CLAIRE: Eric,
this is your only choice.

372
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:55,099
If we don't
do the transplant,
you will die.

373
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:56,702
ERIC: I don't want him
to be a part of me,

374
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:58,633
inside me forever,
all right?

375
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,668
I don't care what you
or anybody else says, okay?

376
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,843
It's my body,
and I don't want it!

377
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,980
That's ridiculous.

378
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,342
Personality traits
aren't transferred in
an organ transplant.

379
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,551
It's also irrelevant.

380
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:13,882
Children don't consent
to surgeries,

381
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:15,577
their parents do.

382
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,518
But if he doesn't cooperate
with the anti-rejection
regimen,

383
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,824
we could be wasting a liver
that could save
someone else's life.

384
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:21,446
DR. PARK: No one's
getting saved by Tirayan.

385
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:22,891
I found a Type-A donor.
It's not a perfect match,
but...

386
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:25,156
His body's already
rejected a perfect match.

387
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:27,355
There's no way it can tolerate
an incompatible blood type.

388
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,157
CLAIRE:
No, the only way
to save Eric

389
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:31,029
is to do the transplant
with Tirayan's liver.

390
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:32,168
That is it.

391
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:33,972
We have
no other option.

392
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:39,767
Let the O.R. know we're gonna
need more restraints.

393
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:43,681
Dr. Clinton Ford
out of Alberta

394
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:46,383
developed an experimental
resorbable material.

395
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,446
It would allow us
to expand her rib cage

396
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:50,645
and create room
to fit her heart inside.

397
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,217
DR. LIM:
An artificial sternum.

398
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,785
DR. REZNICK:
That would actually
grow along with the patient.

399
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:57,494
The surgery
isn't reversible.

400
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:58,927
If it doesn't work,

401
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:01,492
we can't just move her heart
back to where it was.

402
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,201
It would allow her
to have a life.

403
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:06,033
She has a life,
and she'll be healthy

404
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:07,669
as long as she stays
out of crowds,

405
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:08,844
doesn't hug anyone,

406
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,471
or do anything
where she might fall.

407
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:13,407
I get you're autistic,
but I know even you realize

408
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,113
when a patient
cries and throws
her phone against the wall,

409
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:18,176
they're not happy
with their current health.

410
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:19,875
There's no reason
to make this personal.

411
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:21,806
DR. REZNICK:
There is if his medical
judgment is biased.

412
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:25,021
I saw she was upset.

413
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:28,215
You saw it,
but you didn't understand it.

414
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:31,088
You're very competitive.

415
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:34,228
Are you trying to make
Dr. Lim think I'm biased,

416
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:37,304
or are you trying
to undermine my confidence?

417
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:39,534
I'm actually trying
to help you and the patient.

418
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,229
She wants to be able
to rub elbows,

419
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:44,271
and you need to learn
how to trade elbows.

420
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:48,677
DR. LIM: The resorbable plate
is experimental and risky.

421
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:52,681
But my medical judgment
is that it's worth it.

422
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:56,284
Make sure she agrees
and then get her prepped.

423
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:03,621
Why me?

424
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,430
I'm not famous, I don't know
anything about medicine,

425
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:08,803
and giving the keynote speech
at your fundraiser

426
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,231
is a steep price to pay
for a beer-stained jacket.

427
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:17,795
You grew up
in San Jose.

428
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:23,080
You went to San Jose State
despite being accepted
by both Princeton and MIT,

429
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:24,743
and you headquartered
your company here,

430
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:28,081
despite huge tax breaks
offered by Chicago
and Minneapolis.

431
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:29,548
And it was
his favorite jacket.

432
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:31,276
Well, when I offered
to have it cleaned,

433
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:33,151
he said not to bother
because he didn't
even like the jacket.

434
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,320
He was being polite.
Polite?

435
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,858
I take it you've never been
to a game with him.

436
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,761
You did some homework,
but not enough.

437
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:43,598
I love this city,
but I have giving speeches.

438
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:46,003
So don't give a speech.

439
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,025
Tell us a story.

440
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:49,671
Like the one you told
at the wrap party

441
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:50,996
at the Youth Dance company's
fall musical.

442
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,010
The one where you got lost
at the Paris catacombs.

443
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:56,975
I stand corrected.

444
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:59,613
Your success
is inspiring, Aiden,

445
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,679
as well as your loyalty
to this city.

446
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:05,489
And the fact that
you're young,
apparently very funny...

447
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:07,522
I'm in.

448
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,957
Actually, I was in
as soon as Aaron told me

449
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,361
what you wanted
to meet about.

450
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,994
But I was curious what
your attack strategy would be.

451
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,500
So, how was it?

452
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:17,032
It was very effective.

453
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,359
DR. PARK:
Now, don't worry.

454
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,900
He's been a model inmate
for nine years

455
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,504
and tutors
the other prisoners
in the library.

456
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,420
Coke nail come in handy
up at Pelican Bay?

457
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,752
I make jewelry.

458
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,047
Helps me
pick up the beads.

459
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,289
Is there a history of cancer
or liver disease
in your family?

460
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,816
I went through this
a couple of months ago.

461
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,690
You have my file.

462
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,489
We need to do
our own exam.

463
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:23,601
CLAIRE: And there's nothing
about your family
in previous records.

464
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:24,733
Are they still alive?

465
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:26,027
They're dead to me.

466
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:28,168
Quit stalling, or we'll
send you back right now.

467
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:34,738
I haven't spoken to anyone
in my family since
I was 15 years old.

468
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:37,637
Last I know, uh,
both my parents
were healthy enough

469
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,450
to kick the crap out of me
on a daily basis.

470
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:43,578
Any other questions?

471
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,180
Why do you want
to do this?

472
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:48,122
Maybe I just like, uh,
cute nurses and bad Jell-o.

473
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,217
Why do you care?
We don't.

474
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,120
As long as you do
what you're told.

475
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:54,755
Don't worry.

476
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:57,127
I'm very good
at following orders.

477
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:08,737
Councilman Burns must be
very happy with his facelift.

478
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:10,638
He just bought another table
for the fundraiser.

479
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,580
I aim to please,
but you already knew that.

480
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,616
And I need to
get into surgery,
so stop being so coy.

481
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:16,882
What's up?

482
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:21,321
You and Isabel always
seem very happy,

483
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:24,058
able to manage both
your professional
and personal lives.

484
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:27,963
I'm flattered you think so,
but still a bit coy.

485
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:30,257
When I met with Aiden Coulter
about being our keynote,

486
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,530
I thought there was a spark.

487
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:33,828
Okay, so now we're
getting somewhere.

488
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,600
Surgery can wait
a few minutes.

489
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:40,769
Is it unprofessional of me
to explore it?

490
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,140
He's not
a hospital employee,

491
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,938
but potentially
a significant donor

492
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:46,911
and younger.

493
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:47,979
Quite a bit.

494
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:49,247
Mm-hmm.

495
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,950
I don't know, maybe I'm
just imagining something

496
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:54,349
that doesn't even exist.

497
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:55,561
Oh, I doubt that.

498
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:57,522
You're an attractive, smart,
interesting woman.

499
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,530
I'm sure
there was a spark.

500
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,230
But you can't date a donor
like Coulter.

501
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,455
Sorry.

502
00:21:04,531 --> 00:21:06,371
There's no actual policy
against it.

503
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:09,103
I'm not talking policy,
I'm talking optics.

504
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:10,998
The last thing you want
is someone thinking

505
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,540
you'd use sex
to get a big donation.

506
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:17,307
It's a double standard,
I know,

507
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:19,447
but it's the world
we live in.

508
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:21,552
I said no!
I don't want it!

509
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,880
I thought you gave him
something to calm him.

510
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:26,491
We did,
but he's too agitated.

511
00:21:26,553 --> 00:21:28,563
I'm gonna start him
on IV midazolam now.

512
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:31,861
Eric. Eric, remember
what Dr. Park said
earlier about focusing?

513
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:33,664
I know you can do that.

514
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:34,926
How about we get those earbuds
you had earlier?

515
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:37,534
No! Leave me alone!
Eric! Stop it.

516
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:39,297

when I'm not in surgery.

Yes. Do you think people
believe you're a better doctor

522
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,760
because of that?

523
00:22:10,397 --> 00:22:11,997
Some people.

524

Others probably just think
I'm a show-off or arrogant,

to Glassman about this?

No. I make
my own decisions now.

537
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:53,543
Murphy, people who matter
will help your career

538
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:55,236
because they're impressed
with your talent

539

and potential
as a surgeon.

540
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:59,079
And I could send you
to my tailor,

541
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:01,475
where you'll definitely
spend two grand.

542
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:03,548
But my advice would be
just rent one.

543
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:05,116

by the manager,

544
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:07,354

couple-hundred bucks,
you'll be fine.

a new liver donor?

692
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:20,177
Actually, it's,
it's the same one.

696
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,419
Eric,
when the donor found out

697
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:34,630
that he couldn't do
the surgery to help you,

698
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:37,103
he became incredibly sad

699
00:31:37,163 --> 00:31:41,873
because he wanted you to live
more than he wanted to live.

700
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:48,573
He ended his life so that
you could have his liver.

701
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:53,975
He... He knew he'd done
some bad things,

702
00:31:54,046 --> 00:31:57,216
and I think that
this was the only way

703
00:31:57,283 --> 00:31:59,193
he knew
how to make amends.

704
00:32:01,187 --> 00:32:03,587
I think we should try
and help him.

705
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:07,457
Do you think
you can do that?

deep breaths

710

any lung complications,

00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:37,878
(SCOFFS)

870
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:40,614
What's wrong?

871
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:45,324
It's the song that played
during our first overnight
at the hospital.

872
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,653
* I wanna touch you,
but I'm too late

873
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,589
We had our first kiss
to this song.

874
00:39:49,655 --> 00:39:53,425
* I wanna touch you,
but there's history

875
00:39:53,492 --> 00:39:54,662
I'm sorry.

876
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:57,396
It's been a long day.

877
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:00,174
Yeah.

878
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,901
Jared,
it doesn't mean anything.

879
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,772
Yeah, it does.

880
00:40:07,506 --> 00:40:10,776
* There's a love
between us still

881
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:12,342
I love you, Claire.

882
00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:14,384
You never loved me.

883
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:19,184
Now, I thought that
maybe someday that
would change,

884
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,948
but it won't.

885
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,490
* But I know
I'm out of my mind

886
00:40:28,293 --> 00:40:29,533
Bye, Claire.

887
00:40:29,595 --> 00:40:31,455
* There's a love
between us still

888
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:35,670
* But something's changed,
and I don't know why

889
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:39,814
* Never felt so close,
but now I know it's over

890
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:42,541
* And all I wanna do
is go home with you *

891
00:40:42,608 --> 00:40:43,808
(SURROUND ME BY LEON PLAYING)

892
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:45,775
* The lights go down

893
00:40:45,844 --> 00:40:50,224
* I want you around me

894
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:54,351
* Oh, oh, oh

895
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:55,819
* Ohh-oh

896
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:57,987
* Don't overthink it

897
00:40:58,056 --> 00:41:00,086
* Just finish up your drink

898
00:41:00,158 --> 00:41:02,728
* And surround me

899
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:06,464
* Surround me
DR. LEVY: I have 140
applications for fellows,

900
00:41:06,532 --> 00:41:08,502
not one of them has a clue
how to write an...

901
00:41:08,567 --> 00:41:09,567
Hello.

902
00:41:09,635 --> 00:41:11,895
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

903
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,740
I'm a resident here.

904
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:15,535
* Surround me

905
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:18,137
I'm Dr. Jake Levy,
surgical oncology.

906
00:41:18,877 --> 00:41:20,877
Toby Yang,
pathology.

907
00:41:20,946 --> 00:41:22,846
May Curtis, ortho.

908
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:24,754
* Surround me

909
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:27,486
* Surround me

910
00:41:27,553 --> 00:41:28,693
Okay.

911
00:41:28,754 --> 00:41:30,364
Apparently I was wrong.

912
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:35,361
I told Dr. Murphy
he'd be fine renting
a tuxedo.

913
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:37,056
Clearly, he chose
not to listen.

914
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:38,498
(CHUCKLES)
I'm sorry.

915
00:41:38,564 --> 00:41:39,774
Don't be.
You look fantastic.

916
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,301
What is it, Armani?

917
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:43,296
Yes, it cost...

918
00:41:43,368 --> 00:41:46,568
Well, whatever you paid
for it, it was worth.

919
00:41:47,673 --> 00:41:49,043
How's the golf game,
Jake?

920
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:50,707
Oh, same as always.
Mmm.

921
00:41:50,776 --> 00:41:52,576
I know how that is.

922
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,614
You play golf,
Murphy?

923
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,420
I have,
but I don't like it.

924
00:41:57,482 --> 00:42:00,222
(LAUGHTER)

925
00:42:00,285 --> 00:42:02,445
None...
None of us do.

926
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,290
You know what they say...
"Golf is a good walk spoiled."

927
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,087
(LAUGHTER)

928
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:09,559
Yes.

929
00:42:09,628 --> 00:42:10,858
* Surround me

930
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:13,699
* So don't let me go

931
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:15,965
* No, don't let me go

932
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,704
* Surround me

933
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:21,810
* Surround me *
