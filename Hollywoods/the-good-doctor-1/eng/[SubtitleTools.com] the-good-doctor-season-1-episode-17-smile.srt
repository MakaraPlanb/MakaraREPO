1
00:00:29,954 --> 00:00:31,356
The timing was good.

2
00:00:31,447 --> 00:00:35,559
I just got a job transfer, Gretchen
will start at a new school.

3
00:00:35,626 --> 00:00:37,560
We're gonna start
a whole new life.

4
00:00:37,627 --> 00:00:38,962
It's very exciting.

5
00:00:39,029 --> 00:00:41,166
In college, my dad
majored in cheerleading.

6
00:00:44,468 --> 00:00:45,535
That was a joke.

7
00:00:45,602 --> 00:00:47,571
Gretchen's got
a great sense of humor.

8
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:49,740
I'm laughing
on the inside.

9
00:00:49,807 --> 00:00:51,942
Soon you'll be laughing
on the outside, too.

10
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,244
Dr. Park.

11
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:54,978
Moebius syndrome

12
00:00:55,045 --> 00:00:58,148
is a paralysis of the sixth and
seventh pair of cranial nerves.

13
00:00:58,215 --> 00:01:00,751
The seventh pair
controls facial expression.

14
00:01:00,818 --> 00:01:02,186
Luckily, in Gretchen's case,

15
00:01:02,252 --> 00:01:04,154
we haven't found any
limitation to the sixth pair.

16
00:01:04,222 --> 00:01:05,990
I'm a lucky girl.

17
00:01:06,056 --> 00:01:08,192
We'll be taking two slivers
of muscle from your thighs,

18
00:01:08,258 --> 00:01:09,793
along with their nerves
and blood supply,

19
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:11,561
and transplanting them
into your cheeks.

20
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:12,931
There'll be considerable
recovery time

21
00:01:12,996 --> 00:01:14,998
before you'll be able
to smile at will,

22
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:16,400
maybe three months.

23
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:19,837
So, what do you say?
Are you up for this?

24
00:01:21,272 --> 00:01:22,340
Can I sleep on it?

25
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,010
See what
I have to live with?

26
00:01:26,076 --> 00:01:27,444
Nobody knows
when I'm joking.

27
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:30,915
Sorry, Dr. Andrews.
Yes, I am very up for this.

28
00:01:30,981 --> 00:01:33,918
Okay, great. So unless
there are any other questions...

29
00:01:33,984 --> 00:01:35,453
Do you want to be
a comedian?

30
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:42,227
People getting your jokes
must be very important to you

31
00:01:42,293 --> 00:01:43,528
if you think
it's worth the risk

32
00:01:43,594 --> 00:01:45,696
of dying
during elective surgery.

33
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:58,656
Subtitles by explosiveskull

34
00:02:04,781 --> 00:02:06,883
I apologize
for Dr. Murphy.

35
00:02:06,951 --> 00:02:09,686
He's still learning that
silence is the right choice

36
00:02:09,752 --> 00:02:11,721
when you have nothing useful
to offer.

37
00:02:11,788 --> 00:02:16,059
We are required to have an
honest risk/benefit discussion

38
00:02:16,126 --> 00:02:17,862
with our patients.

39
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:20,064
We are giving
a lovely young girl a smile.

40
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,298
That's a simple equation.

41
00:02:21,364 --> 00:02:24,001
Well, it's more than
the smile or the jokes.

42
00:02:24,067 --> 00:02:26,904
She can't express
any emotions at all.

43
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,873
No one can tell
if she's happy or sad

44
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,276
or scared, anything.

45
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,579
She's never had
much of a social life.

46
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:37,280
Ever since her mother died,

47
00:02:37,347 --> 00:02:39,382
she's been
completely withdrawn.

48
00:02:41,651 --> 00:02:46,256
All I want to do is bring my
baby girl back into the world.

49
00:02:46,322 --> 00:02:49,093
Don't worry, Mr. Milman, we're gonna
take great care of her, all right?

50
00:02:54,732 --> 00:02:57,568
Lucy has a post-op infection
of unknown origin.

51
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:00,304
Infusing 900 milligrams
of clindamycin.

52
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,373
It's terrible, isn't it?

53
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,474
Yes, it is.

54
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:04,743
Have you been changing
your dressing?

55
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:05,843
Every day.

56
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,778
- Soaking it in clean, warm water?
- Yes.

57
00:03:07,845 --> 00:03:10,014
Taking your antibiotics,
one pill, three times a day?

58
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,483
That's a no.

59
00:03:14,084 --> 00:03:16,853
Lucy, I know I gave you
a scrip for antibiotics,

60
00:03:16,921 --> 00:03:17,956
along with one
for pain meds.

61
00:03:18,023 --> 00:03:19,391
Why haven't you been
taking your antibiotics?

62
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:23,394
Did you have a bad reaction
to them, or...

63
00:03:24,762 --> 00:03:27,866
I never filled
my prescription.

64
00:03:27,931 --> 00:03:30,968
I didn't think it was necessary
until it got really bad,

65
00:03:31,035 --> 00:03:33,338
and then I was too weak
to go myself,

66
00:03:33,404 --> 00:03:35,440
and I didn't have anyone
to pick it up for me.

67
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:36,975
Okay. Mystery solved.

68
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,946
I'm sorry.
I know it was stupid.

69
00:03:42,012 --> 00:03:43,346
Very stupid.

70
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,561
Okay.

71
00:03:58,696 --> 00:03:59,697
Hey, Shaun.

72
00:04:01,565 --> 00:04:02,933
Oh. Hello.

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,403
I haven't seen you in ages.
What's... What's new?

74
00:04:06,603 --> 00:04:08,172
I'm buying an apple.

75
00:04:08,238 --> 00:04:10,306
I can see that.
Here, I'll get it for you.

76
00:04:10,374 --> 00:04:11,909
No, thank you.

77
00:04:11,976 --> 00:04:13,311
Thank you, Shaun.

78
00:04:13,377 --> 00:04:14,811
What else is new?

79
00:04:14,877 --> 00:04:17,849
You didn't want
to be friends.

80
00:04:17,914 --> 00:04:22,251
Um, yeah, no, I... We... We...
We... We're colleagues.

81
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:24,488
You know, we're...
Whatever we are,

82
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:25,856
we can still talk.
We should talk.

83
00:04:25,923 --> 00:04:27,925
I have a new friend.
Kenny.

84
00:04:27,991 --> 00:04:29,326
Here you go.

85
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,695
Thank you, Debbie.

86
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,329
Kenny, huh?
That's, uh, that's great.

87
00:04:33,397 --> 00:04:34,699
Do you have
a new friend?

88
00:04:37,168 --> 00:04:38,502
No.

89
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:39,838
- Okay.
- Thank you.

90
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,005
Thank you.

91
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,673
We can talk.

92
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,108
You know,
we can talk about sports,

93
00:04:44,175 --> 00:04:45,376
we can talk about weather,
we can talk about...

94
00:04:45,442 --> 00:04:46,978
Debbie?

95
00:04:47,043 --> 00:04:48,044
Why would you want
to talk about Debbie?

96
00:04:48,111 --> 00:04:49,713
Debbie was flirting
with you.

97
00:04:51,115 --> 00:04:52,250
She was?

98
00:04:52,317 --> 00:04:55,553
Yes. I noticed her exhibiting
two typical signs.

99
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,555
- Not the trifecta, huh?
- No, not the trifecta,

100
00:04:57,622 --> 00:04:58,823
and one atypical sign.

101
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:00,325
I think she's just
trying to be friendly.

102
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,626
She gave you
an extra dollar in change.

103
00:05:04,796 --> 00:05:07,632
And the fact that you didn't
notice means you like her, too.

104
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,769
Maybe she's just
bad at math.

105
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,147
My dad said that
you're on the spectrum.

106
00:05:23,214 --> 00:05:25,783
That's why you said that about
people getting my jokes.

107
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:27,918
People always
get my jokes.

108
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:29,786
Then you're very lucky.

109
00:05:32,122 --> 00:05:33,124
That was a joke.

110
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,392
I see what you did there.

111
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,161
Yes.

112
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:43,233
They call me
"Resting Gretch Face."

113
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:47,437
"Shaun the Moron."

114
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:53,911
Not very witty.
I'm obviously quite smart.

115
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,947
I drew this
to their attention.

116
00:05:59,983 --> 00:06:01,286
I'm on a spectrum, too.

117
00:06:03,687 --> 00:06:07,158
Somewhere between inscrutable,
unapproachable, and...

118
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,495
Actively scorned.

119
00:06:10,562 --> 00:06:13,397
I don't want to be
more approachable,

120
00:06:13,464 --> 00:06:17,101
and I prefer people
not reading my emotions.

121
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,036
They're mine.

122
00:06:19,103 --> 00:06:20,171
That's what you do
with friends.

123
00:06:29,747 --> 00:06:32,317
You really think
this surgery's too risky?

124
00:06:32,382 --> 00:06:34,851
Possible complications
include embolism,

125
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:36,419
hemorrhage,
collateral paralysis,

126
00:06:36,486 --> 00:06:39,022
asymmetry, brain damage,
and stroke.

127
00:06:42,526 --> 00:06:45,829
It's also expensive
and medically unnecessary.

128
00:06:47,531 --> 00:06:49,500
Okay,
look straight ahead.

129
00:06:52,368 --> 00:06:55,138
There's a two-hour wait in the
E.R., and what are we doing?

130
00:06:55,205 --> 00:06:58,108
Treating a woman because she
willfully ignored doctors' orders.

131
00:06:58,175 --> 00:07:01,245
I know what a parasite looks
like, and it's not Lucy.

132
00:07:01,312 --> 00:07:03,114
So this is
a Mom thing with you.

133
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,681
Growing up
with a whack mother means

134
00:07:04,748 --> 00:07:07,016
that you can identify any and
all problem personalities.

135
00:07:07,084 --> 00:07:10,687
And that is the sole upside to my
miserable childhood, thank you.

136
00:07:10,753 --> 00:07:12,455
Well, at least
you had a mom.

137
00:07:12,522 --> 00:07:13,724
Mine died
when I was six,

138
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,459
and Dad instantly married
a child-hating bitch

139
00:07:15,526 --> 00:07:16,526
with a butt-load
of debt.

140
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,163
Morgan, I'm sorry.

141
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:20,597
I didn't tell you
to get sympathy.

142
00:07:20,664 --> 00:07:22,200
Just that I know
parasites, too.

143
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:31,675
Got you booked first
thing tomorrow morning.

144
00:07:33,276 --> 00:07:34,310
Dad.

145
00:07:34,377 --> 00:07:35,712
What? Too soon?

146
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:36,813
It's...

147
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,550
You're nervous.
I get it.

148
00:07:40,618 --> 00:07:43,019
If you have any more
questions, feel free.

149
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,156
I've changed my mind.

150
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,795
I'm not having
the surgery.

151
00:07:59,805 --> 00:08:00,806
Murphy.

152
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,312
Hello.

153
00:08:09,014 --> 00:08:11,651
Gretchen's father
is very upset.

154
00:08:11,717 --> 00:08:13,551
It seems you talked her
out of the surgery.

155
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,788
No, I didn't talk her out
of it or talk her anywhere.

156
00:08:16,854 --> 00:08:19,524
I just gave her the list
of potential risks.

157
00:08:19,591 --> 00:08:21,894
Embolism, hemorrhage,
collateral paralysis,

158
00:08:21,961 --> 00:08:23,863
asymmetry, brain damage,
and stroke.

159
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,031
Stroke?

160
00:08:25,096 --> 00:08:28,133
Yes, there was a case
in Brazil in 2004.

161
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,336
and the patient suffer...

162
00:08:31,336 --> 00:08:33,205
It seems
that you don't believe

163
00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:36,276
that restoring this girl's
smile is that important.

164
00:08:36,342 --> 00:08:38,611
Smiles are overvalued.

165
00:08:38,677 --> 00:08:40,145
There are studies
that support that.

166
00:08:40,213 --> 00:08:41,613
And there are studies
that don't.

167
00:08:42,781 --> 00:08:44,983
When we smile,
we produce endorphins.

168
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,152
They make us happy. They
make other people happy.

169
00:08:47,219 --> 00:08:50,555
When we see smiles, our
basotemporal lobes are activated,

170
00:08:50,623 --> 00:08:52,425
and we duplicate
what we see.

171
00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:54,327
Murphy,
smiles are contagious.

172
00:08:55,695 --> 00:08:56,695
You see?

173
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:00,466
I feel good,
you feel good.

174
00:09:00,532 --> 00:09:01,700
Everybody likes smiles.

175
00:09:05,972 --> 00:09:07,373
I don't.

176
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,742
In any case,
your smile wasn't sincere

177
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:12,377
since it didn't demonstrate
the Duchenne Marker.

178
00:09:12,444 --> 00:09:16,248
There was no involvement of the orbicularis
oculi muscles around the eyes,

179
00:09:16,315 --> 00:09:18,450
which means you didn't
release endorphins.

180
00:09:19,819 --> 00:09:21,286
You know,
if you can talk her

181
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:22,988
out of a surgery
she's wanted for years,

182
00:09:23,055 --> 00:09:26,025
I'm pretty sure a conversation
with someone objective

183
00:09:26,092 --> 00:09:27,560
can talk her
back into it.

184
00:09:27,627 --> 00:09:30,162
Get Park, come with,
and keep quiet.

185
00:09:31,797 --> 00:09:32,798
Okay.

186
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:38,805
Dr. Kalu.

187
00:09:39,939 --> 00:09:40,973
Remember me?

188
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,108
"Fish girl"?

189
00:09:43,175 --> 00:09:45,444
- Uh, hi. Celez. Hi.
- Yeah.

190
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:48,314
Yes, uh, of course I do.

191
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,948
I hope it's okay
that I requested you.

192
00:09:50,016 --> 00:09:51,084
I'm glad you did.

193
00:09:52,352 --> 00:09:53,519
How are you doing?

194
00:09:53,585 --> 00:09:55,754
Oh, that's what
you're going to tell me.

195
00:09:57,955 --> 00:10:00,259
I've been wearing the, uh,
tilapia skins for five months.

196
00:10:02,094 --> 00:10:04,597
I'm getting really tired of being
followed home by stray cats.

197
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:07,299
How's the pain?

198
00:10:07,366 --> 00:10:08,401
Compared to
what it was?

199
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:10,402
Nothing.

200
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,340
Uh, any... any fever,
itchiness, or swelling?

201
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:16,408
Nope.

202
00:10:16,475 --> 00:10:17,775
Well,
it looks very good.

203
00:10:17,843 --> 00:10:18,844
But?

204
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:21,480
How much longer?

205
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:26,251
Um, how do you feel
about tomorrow?

206
00:10:28,554 --> 00:10:29,555
Seriously?

207
00:10:29,622 --> 00:10:31,323
I never joke
about tilapia.

208
00:10:36,228 --> 00:10:37,997
What's the matter?

209
00:10:38,063 --> 00:10:40,366
I-I just wasn't
expecting that.

210
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:42,935
I...

211
00:10:45,972 --> 00:10:47,840
I'm afraid of how
I'm going to look.

212
00:10:49,874 --> 00:10:51,109
You're going
to look beautiful.

213
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,648
Tomorrow.

214
00:10:58,584 --> 00:10:59,919
I know Dr. Murphy
informed you

215
00:10:59,984 --> 00:11:01,887
about the risks
of this surgery,

216
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:05,558
and some risks are significant
and some just aren't.

217
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:09,227
This is as close to risk-free
surgery as we can get.

218
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:12,397
It'll give you a smile,
it'll let you laugh.

219
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:13,899
No.

220
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:16,669
Dr. Murphy didn't
talk me out of it.

221
00:11:19,103 --> 00:11:20,205
He inspired me.

222
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:26,311
He helped me realize that this
could actually make me stronger.

223
00:11:28,614 --> 00:11:30,148
I don't want
to run from it anymore.

224
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:42,127
Yeah, she's lying.

225
00:11:43,563 --> 00:11:45,564
She's a smart,
sarcastic young woman,

226
00:11:45,631 --> 00:11:48,767
not exactly someone who's prone
to inspirational stories.

227
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,169
Why would she lie
about changing her mind?

228
00:11:50,234 --> 00:11:51,903
Well,
when I was a cop,

229
00:11:51,969 --> 00:11:53,339
I had a lot of people change their
minds about testifying in court,

230
00:11:53,405 --> 00:11:55,474
and it always came down
to one of three reasons.

231
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,545
Fear, confusion,
or they were paid off.

232
00:11:59,377 --> 00:12:00,445
She doesn't seem confused.

233
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:01,747
And I don't think
she's afraid.

234
00:12:01,814 --> 00:12:03,949
So Gretchen
was paid off?

235
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:06,651
I admit the analogy
isn't perfect.

236
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:08,621
It's close enough.

237
00:12:17,796 --> 00:12:20,432
Guess who's back
in the E.R.

238
00:12:20,498 --> 00:12:23,902
You're happy, so I'm guessing
it's a non-compliant patient.

239
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,171
You misjudged Lucy.

240
00:12:26,238 --> 00:12:29,374
She made an honest mistake
forgetting her prescriptions.

241
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:31,009
You called her,
didn't you?

242
00:12:31,076 --> 00:12:34,846
She didn't spontaneously
remember, you had to remind her.

243
00:12:34,914 --> 00:12:36,849
Is that
a Mom thing, too?

244
00:12:36,915 --> 00:12:41,688
Gretchen, are you worried that your
dad can't afford this surgery?

245
00:12:41,753 --> 00:12:43,623
The insurance company
is paying for it.

246
00:12:45,257 --> 00:12:46,258
Dad...

247
00:12:47,325 --> 00:12:48,327
I know it isn't.

248
00:12:48,927 --> 00:12:50,095
It's elective.

249
00:12:50,997 --> 00:12:52,599
It's medically unnecessary.

250
00:12:53,866 --> 00:12:57,036
No one can put a value
on your smile.

251
00:12:57,103 --> 00:13:00,173
Not bullies, not an insurance
company, not even Dr. Murphy.

252
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:05,277
In my opinion, this surgery's
medically necessary.

253
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,785
Gretchen, sweetie...

254
00:13:14,286 --> 00:13:15,655
My first memory
of your mother

255
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:19,592
was of her smiling at me
from across the room.

256
00:13:20,725 --> 00:13:22,260
And because of that smile,

257
00:13:23,362 --> 00:13:24,397
we ended up with you.

258
00:13:25,964 --> 00:13:28,133
And... And my last
memory of her

259
00:13:29,066 --> 00:13:30,068
is that radiance

260
00:13:31,237 --> 00:13:33,238
lighting up the world
one last time.

261
00:13:37,142 --> 00:13:39,545
I mean,
we never had much money,

262
00:13:39,612 --> 00:13:41,113
but as long
as I had that smile,

263
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:43,649
it didn't matter.

264
00:13:49,821 --> 00:13:51,022
I love you, Dad.

265
00:13:53,425 --> 00:13:56,527
And that's why I can't let you
give up everything for this.

266
00:14:08,773 --> 00:14:10,341
Lucy Callard?

267
00:14:10,408 --> 00:14:11,410
I'm here.

268
00:14:14,246 --> 00:14:17,550
Um,
Lucille Elizabeth Callard?

269
00:14:18,151 --> 00:14:19,450
Yes, that's me.

270
00:14:19,517 --> 00:14:21,719
A Dr. Browne called me
to pick up my prescriptions?

271
00:14:26,677 --> 00:14:29,030
You're the victim
of identity theft, Lucy.

272
00:14:29,096 --> 00:14:32,417
There's an impostor using your name
and medical ID to get benefits.

273
00:14:32,483 --> 00:14:34,085
Did you have your purse
stolen recently?

274
00:14:34,152 --> 00:14:35,887
Six weeks ago.

275
00:14:35,952 --> 00:14:38,021
And you had your driver's license
and credit cards replaced,

276
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:39,491
but not your
health-insurance card?

277
00:14:41,191 --> 00:14:44,763
Is this why the pharmacy refuses
to fill my prescriptions?

278
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,032
I'm on pain meds
for post-herpetic neuralgia.

279
00:14:47,864 --> 00:14:49,868
It's getting really bad.

280
00:14:49,935 --> 00:14:52,070
Once the impostor filled her
prescription for pain meds,

281
00:14:52,135 --> 00:14:53,237
the pharmacy
must have thought

282
00:14:53,305 --> 00:14:54,773
you were
overfilling opiates.

283
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:56,174
Oh!

284
00:14:56,239 --> 00:14:58,308
It always flares up
when I get upset.

285
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:01,178
Don't worry, Lucy,
we'll get you your meds.

286
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:10,655
We... We can't.

287
00:15:10,721 --> 00:15:12,857
We're already treating
"Lucy Callard."

288
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:19,763
Nice game, Tony.

289
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:20,931
Hi, Jim.

290
00:15:20,998 --> 00:15:22,700
- Marcus, hey. You coming or going?
- Neither.

291
00:15:23,834 --> 00:15:25,503
15-year-old girl
with Moebius Syndrome.

292
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,504
Your company
denied coverage.

293
00:15:29,306 --> 00:15:32,943
No respiratory issues, deformities,
pain, she doesn't even drool.

294
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,244
She's fully functional.

295
00:15:34,311 --> 00:15:37,448
She can't smile.
That's a function.

296
00:15:37,514 --> 00:15:38,949
Marcus,
I think it's wonderful

297
00:15:39,017 --> 00:15:41,119
you want to give
this little girl her smile,

298
00:15:41,186 --> 00:15:43,620
but if we pay for everything
wonderful, we'll go bankrupt, huh?

299
00:15:43,687 --> 00:15:45,155
And then
who are we helping?

300
00:15:45,223 --> 00:15:48,159
We all know doctors cheat
diagnoses to get coverage.

301
00:15:48,225 --> 00:15:50,027
"Deviated septum"
gets you a free nose job,

302
00:15:50,095 --> 00:15:51,196
"migraine"
gets you Botox.

303
00:15:51,262 --> 00:15:52,931
Do you really want me
to play that game?

304
00:15:54,898 --> 00:15:56,267
This isn't a game
for me.

305
00:15:56,332 --> 00:15:58,935
We're a reputable company
with very high standards.

306
00:15:59,003 --> 00:16:01,638
Very high bonuses that get even
higher with your denial rate.

307
00:16:01,705 --> 00:16:03,975
I was gonna
suggest we end this

308
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:05,575
before we say something
we'll regret,

309
00:16:05,643 --> 00:16:07,045
but I believe
that just happened.

310
00:16:08,113 --> 00:16:10,214
Gretchen's socially isolated,
depressed,

311
00:16:10,281 --> 00:16:12,417
and that's only
gonna get worse.

312
00:16:12,483 --> 00:16:13,883
What if she slashes
her wrists?

313
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,253
You'd prefer
to cover that?

314
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:17,122
Are you threatening me
with a teenage girl's suicide?

315
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:20,391
And God forbid
something does happen to her,

316
00:16:20,457 --> 00:16:22,960
'cause I'll make sure that this
conversation's part of the permanent record.

317
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:38,776
Dr. Andrews said
smiles are contagious,

318
00:16:38,843 --> 00:16:40,745
and I'm testing
that hypothesis.

319
00:16:42,113 --> 00:16:44,416
Well, I'm not sure your study
will prove anything.

320
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:45,582
It might have
something to do

321
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:47,251
with the lack
of the Duchenne Marker.

322
00:16:47,317 --> 00:16:49,220
Oh, yes.

323
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:50,287
But here you go.

324
00:16:53,758 --> 00:16:55,526
That wasn't a smile.

325
00:16:55,593 --> 00:16:56,595
Sure it was.

326
00:17:00,298 --> 00:17:02,400
I want to show you
something.

327
00:17:12,676 --> 00:17:14,279
You need to follow me.

328
00:17:15,413 --> 00:17:16,414
Okay.

329
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,784
The impostor has poisoned the
real Lucy's medical record.

330
00:17:20,851 --> 00:17:22,286
We have to go through
every medication,

331
00:17:22,352 --> 00:17:25,089
every notation, every test
to determine whose is whose.

332
00:17:25,156 --> 00:17:28,225
Doing that with zero tolerance for
errors could take six months.

333
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:30,360
Well, the paperwork
is our problem, not hers.

334
00:17:30,427 --> 00:17:33,763
Not if the confusion results in a harmful
treatment or incorrect diagnosis.

335
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,367
Well, we have to
do something.

336
00:17:35,433 --> 00:17:37,435
This woman
is in serious pain.

337
00:17:37,502 --> 00:17:40,272
So we treat her.
Just be clever about it.

338
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,109
Shaun.

339
00:17:45,176 --> 00:17:47,278
Shaun, I've already
had two iced coffees...

340
00:17:47,343 --> 00:17:49,279
Debbie. Hello, Debbie.

341
00:17:49,347 --> 00:17:51,514
- Shaun...
- You flirted with Dr. Glassman.

342
00:17:51,581 --> 00:17:52,583
Oh, my God.

343
00:17:53,885 --> 00:17:56,621
'Cause I have a new friend,
and he needs one, too.

344
00:17:56,687 --> 00:17:58,656
- I'm so sorry.
- Okay. Look, Dr. Glassman,

345
00:17:58,723 --> 00:18:02,259
Debbie's facial proportions
are close to optimal, okay,

346
00:18:02,326 --> 00:18:04,496
.38 vertical
and .48 horizontal...

347
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:05,629
I'm so sorry.

348
00:18:05,696 --> 00:18:07,098
...so you should find her
attractive.

349
00:18:07,164 --> 00:18:08,331
Thank you?

350
00:18:08,398 --> 00:18:10,001
Shaun...
I'm so sorry.

351
00:18:10,068 --> 00:18:11,936
And I think
you're both Jewish.

352
00:18:14,205 --> 00:18:18,341
Tribal commonality is highly
conducive to social bonding.

353
00:18:26,016 --> 00:18:27,584
Shalom?

354
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:31,421
Bullies can't put a value on
your smile, nor can Dr. Murphy,

355
00:18:31,488 --> 00:18:34,158
but it seems
the insurance company can.

356
00:18:34,225 --> 00:18:37,695
They've agreed to pay
$43.750.

357
00:18:37,761 --> 00:18:39,931
about 85%
of the entire cost.

358
00:18:42,366 --> 00:18:43,401
I can cover
the rest of that.

359
00:18:44,801 --> 00:18:46,369
I swear.

360
00:18:46,436 --> 00:18:50,541
Oh, sweetie, please,
let me do this for you.

361
00:18:57,115 --> 00:18:58,149
Okay.

362
00:18:58,215 --> 00:19:00,618
Okay.

363
00:19:05,557 --> 00:19:06,791
"Jane Doe"?

364
00:19:06,858 --> 00:19:08,225
That's the only way that we
can treat you right now.

365
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:09,627
Go home
and get some rest.

366
00:19:09,694 --> 00:19:12,129
The records department will
call you to sort all this out.

367
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:16,368
A year ago,
I was playing tennis.

368
00:19:17,702 --> 00:19:18,703
And then
the shingles hit,

369
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,738
and I was laid up
for six weeks,

370
00:19:20,803 --> 00:19:23,573
and I've been
on pain meds ever since.

371
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,177
I lost my job, my husband
treats me like I'm an old lady,

372
00:19:27,244 --> 00:19:28,545
and my daughter
thinks I'm too medicated

373
00:19:28,612 --> 00:19:29,813
to be around
the new baby.

374
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,753
Maybe I'll be better off
as "Jane Doe."

375
00:19:43,994 --> 00:19:45,596
The impostor returns.

376
00:19:52,538 --> 00:19:54,708
Lucy? Lucy, can you
squeeze my fingers?

377
00:19:57,009 --> 00:19:58,009
"Lucy"?

378
00:19:58,076 --> 00:20:00,846
She's in septic shock.

379
00:20:00,913 --> 00:20:02,481
Order a lactate level,
blood cultures,

380
00:20:02,548 --> 00:20:04,150
and a broad-spectrum
antibiotic.

381
00:20:04,217 --> 00:20:06,451
I'll tell Melendez we've
initiated Sepsis Protocol.

382
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:07,686
We should report her.

383
00:20:07,753 --> 00:20:09,188
She's a criminal
and a flight risk.

384
00:20:09,256 --> 00:20:10,290
And very, very sick.

385
00:20:10,355 --> 00:20:11,625
We should put someone
outside her door

386
00:20:11,691 --> 00:20:13,425
and arrest her
when she's stable.

387
00:20:13,492 --> 00:20:15,694
We don't report patients
we find with drugs

388
00:20:15,761 --> 00:20:17,431
or non-violent people
with guns.

389
00:20:17,497 --> 00:20:19,700
We do report people
who steal from us.

390
00:20:19,766 --> 00:20:22,535
What would happen
if people who needed our help

391
00:20:22,602 --> 00:20:24,004
thought they would
be arrested?

392
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,737
If they thought they would be
arrested for stealing an ID,

393
00:20:25,805 --> 00:20:27,207
maybe they wouldn't
steal an ID.

394
00:20:27,273 --> 00:20:28,807
I don't remember anything
in the Hippocratic Oath

395
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,344
about checking payor sources
before treatment.

396
00:20:31,411 --> 00:20:35,115
Strongly suggesting there was no health
insurance in 4th century B.C., Greece.

397
00:20:37,983 --> 00:20:39,452
We have
a duty to treat,

398
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,122
and we have the right
to get paid.

399
00:20:43,423 --> 00:20:45,392
But first things first.

400
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,527
Oh, God, I really
do not want to be sued

401
00:20:47,593 --> 00:20:48,996
by either one
of these women.

402
00:20:52,898 --> 00:20:55,500
Maintain the pretense.

403
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:58,871
And as soon as she's stabilized,
we're gonna press charges.

404
00:21:01,641 --> 00:21:04,344
Dr. Park,
pull the muscle, please.

405
00:21:04,411 --> 00:21:07,346
We don't want any excess
gathering in the suture line.

406
00:21:09,816 --> 00:21:11,084
Thank you.

407
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,419
Okay,
remove retractors.

408
00:21:18,357 --> 00:21:19,524
Ready?

409
00:21:26,932 --> 00:21:28,734
Are you sure you don't want
something for the pain?

410
00:21:28,801 --> 00:21:32,204
No. No, I'm good, as long
as you keep talking to me.

411
00:21:33,506 --> 00:21:36,609
Especially if you share
something, uh, very painful.

412
00:21:36,675 --> 00:21:38,010
- Painful?
- Mmm.

413
00:21:39,211 --> 00:21:40,446
Okay...

414
00:21:41,513 --> 00:21:44,716
Like the time
I mistook my biology teacher

415
00:21:44,784 --> 00:21:46,753
for my girlfriend and picked
her up in the hallway?

416
00:21:48,988 --> 00:21:51,090
Yeah, twirled her around
three times

417
00:21:51,156 --> 00:21:52,925
before I realized
my mistake.

418
00:21:52,992 --> 00:21:53,992
That kind of painful?

419
00:21:55,327 --> 00:21:57,530
You may have to dig
even deeper than that.

420
00:22:01,134 --> 00:22:02,201
How about

421
00:22:05,503 --> 00:22:08,207
the time I finally found myself
in the perfect situation?

422
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:14,381
You know, work,
friends, future,

423
00:22:16,015 --> 00:22:17,350
something
I never really had before.

424
00:22:19,885 --> 00:22:21,354
Maybe that's why
I screwed it up.

425
00:22:25,224 --> 00:22:27,993
You're not responding to the
antibiotics like we'd hoped...

426
00:22:29,695 --> 00:22:30,696
Lucy.

427
00:22:32,064 --> 00:22:33,066
You know, don't you?

428
00:22:35,335 --> 00:22:37,002
When the real Lucy Callard
showed up,

429
00:22:37,069 --> 00:22:38,437
it kind of
gave you away.

430
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:41,974
Is there anyone
we can contact?

431
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:45,112
Do you have
any children?

432
00:22:46,412 --> 00:22:48,682
A son.

433
00:22:48,748 --> 00:22:50,450
But he'd be
so ashamed of me.

434
00:22:51,451 --> 00:22:52,486
Where is he?

435
00:22:52,551 --> 00:22:53,818
College...

436
00:22:53,885 --> 00:22:55,122
First one in our family.

437
00:22:56,388 --> 00:23:00,025
I had to choose between
premiums and tuition.

438
00:23:01,861 --> 00:23:04,363
Your son is very lucky
to have such a loving mother.

439
00:23:07,767 --> 00:23:09,602
I just wish
you got your antibiotics

440
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:10,737
when you got
your pain meds.

441
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:13,373
I didn't get
either medication.

442
00:23:14,406 --> 00:23:16,375
Are you sure?

443
00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:19,345
Because the real Lucy was having
problems with the pharmacy.

444
00:23:19,412 --> 00:23:22,048
I didn't want to risk
using the card again.

445
00:23:22,749 --> 00:23:23,850
Is she okay?

446
00:23:31,023 --> 00:23:33,258
Maybe it's time
to move on,

447
00:23:33,326 --> 00:23:37,029
take the lesson with you,
find new friends.

448
00:23:37,096 --> 00:23:39,030
I went to Denver
for an interview last week.

449
00:23:40,633 --> 00:23:41,634
And?

450
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:45,939
And... We're done.

451
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:49,875
Really?

452
00:23:50,476 --> 00:23:51,478
Take a look.

453
00:23:53,511 --> 00:23:54,980
Hey, trust me.

454
00:24:02,489 --> 00:24:04,490
See? Beautiful.

455
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:16,036
The kid, college, it's just
a convenient sob story.

456
00:24:16,102 --> 00:24:17,804
Why would she lie
if she may be dying?

457
00:24:20,507 --> 00:24:22,475
Here's what we don't know
about fake Lucy,

458
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:23,909
whether her story
is true.

459
00:24:23,977 --> 00:24:25,278
Here's what
we do know.

460
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,712
She's a liar who just
found out she's busted.

461
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:30,048
Speaking of lies,

462
00:24:30,115 --> 00:24:33,051
that shingles virus that
the real Lucy had last year?

463
00:24:33,118 --> 00:24:35,454
According to Dr. Spindler
at Santa Clara General,

464
00:24:35,521 --> 00:24:37,155
she had it
the year before, too,

465
00:24:37,222 --> 00:24:39,992
and according to Dr. Millhouse at
SF Muni, the year before that.

466
00:24:42,494 --> 00:24:44,896
She wasn't denied the pain
meds because of our impostor.

467
00:24:44,963 --> 00:24:48,268
She was denied because she
is a garden-variety addict.

468
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:50,636
Well-played, sir.

469
00:25:00,413 --> 00:25:02,580
Dr. Park says
the surgery went well.

470
00:25:04,115 --> 00:25:05,585
It's been too long.

471
00:25:06,184 --> 00:25:07,319
What has?

472
00:25:07,386 --> 00:25:10,123
She should be breathing
on her own by now.

473
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,291
Even after
prolonged anesthesia,

474
00:25:12,357 --> 00:25:14,360
it should only take
60 to 90 minutes.

475
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,567
Is she okay?

476
00:25:21,634 --> 00:25:25,105
She should have
protective airway reflexes,

477
00:25:25,171 --> 00:25:27,940
motor activity,
and a return of consciousness.

478
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,345
I need to page
Dr. Andrews, STAT.

479
00:25:32,412 --> 00:25:33,712
What's going on?

480
00:25:33,778 --> 00:25:35,513
Something bad.

481
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,289
Gretchen's glucose
is within normal limits

482
00:25:42,356 --> 00:25:44,366
and her electrolytes
are also normal.

483
00:25:44,432 --> 00:25:46,461
And we've ruled out hyper-
and hypothermia.

484
00:25:46,528 --> 00:25:48,329
It doesn't leave much.
What about hypoxia?

485
00:25:48,395 --> 00:25:49,730
Uh, she maintained
normal oxygen,

486
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,299
as well as end tidal CO2
throughout the entire case,

487
00:25:52,365 --> 00:25:53,801
and we've given
reversal agents,

488
00:25:54,869 --> 00:25:56,337
which we will repeat.

489
00:25:57,605 --> 00:25:58,839
Do you feel bad?

490
00:26:02,044 --> 00:26:03,545
It's okay.

491
00:26:03,612 --> 00:26:06,514
You told them
it was close to risk-free.

492
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:09,183
They knew there were risks,
and I told them, too.

493
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:14,723
Get a CT. Rule out clots,
hematoma, bleeding, and stroke.

494
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,305
WBCs and lactate
are rising,

495
00:26:30,372 --> 00:26:31,673
O2 sat and MAP
are falling.

496
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,341
The Sepsis Protocol
isn't working.

497
00:26:33,407 --> 00:26:35,909
Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome.
Medications?

498
00:26:35,977 --> 00:26:39,047
Another antibiotic,
ah, continue crystalloids,

499
00:26:39,114 --> 00:26:41,215
- increase her vasopressors?
- Low-dose steroids?

500
00:26:41,281 --> 00:26:44,251
Give 'em all at try, and
intubate her and insert a swan.

501
00:26:44,318 --> 00:26:46,386
And, yes, I understand
this is out of our own pocket.

502
00:27:02,703 --> 00:27:06,441
Um, do anything exciting
for Purim?

503
00:27:06,508 --> 00:27:08,442
Purim. Uh, no.

504
00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:09,910
Yeah, you know, the usual.

505
00:27:09,977 --> 00:27:11,179
Mmm.

506
00:27:11,244 --> 00:27:13,447
Ate a little matzah,

507
00:27:13,513 --> 00:27:16,951
and celebrated
our exodus from slavery,

508
00:27:18,118 --> 00:27:20,821
which I think is Passover
and not Purim.

509
00:27:23,023 --> 00:27:25,426
The truth of the matter is,
I'm only half Jewish,

510
00:27:26,493 --> 00:27:28,795
so only
half the knowledge.

511
00:27:28,863 --> 00:27:32,034
The truth is
I-I'm not Jewish at all.

512
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,935
- Ah.
- Yeah.

513
00:27:35,002 --> 00:27:37,605
Yeah,
my first husband was.

514
00:27:37,672 --> 00:27:41,476
So I guess we have our lack
of Jewishness in common.

515
00:27:45,313 --> 00:27:47,449
You know what, Debbie?
I think I-I should get going.

516
00:27:48,616 --> 00:27:49,817
Okay. Well, it was...

517
00:27:49,884 --> 00:27:53,654
It was nice, uh, finally
meeting you, officially.

518
00:27:53,721 --> 00:27:54,955
Same.

519
00:27:58,058 --> 00:28:00,293
Oh, no,
look at that!

520
00:28:01,628 --> 00:28:04,464
A 1975 300D,

521
00:28:04,531 --> 00:28:06,666
one of the most
perfect Mercedes ever

522
00:28:06,733 --> 00:28:08,269
just got
a little less perfect.

523
00:28:08,336 --> 00:28:10,971
I beg to differ. If you're
looking for perfection,

524
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:14,342
you look no further
than the 1967 280SE.

525
00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:15,510
Cabriolet or coupe?

526
00:28:15,576 --> 00:28:17,278
The coupe,
an all-time classic.

527
00:28:17,345 --> 00:28:22,851
Well, an owner of a 300SL
Gullwing might argue otherwise.

528
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:24,351
- A Gullwing?
- Yeah.

529
00:28:25,553 --> 00:28:28,023
Can I get you
another coffee?

530
00:28:29,356 --> 00:28:30,357
Yeah.

531
00:28:31,358 --> 00:28:32,792
Iced, large, black.

532
00:28:32,859 --> 00:28:34,261
- That's it.
- I know.

533
00:28:51,444 --> 00:28:54,048
That's a little bit
unsettling, Murphy.

534
00:28:56,417 --> 00:28:57,418
Okay.

535
00:29:01,355 --> 00:29:05,626
Why are you studying the current
of ions during electrolysis?

536
00:29:05,693 --> 00:29:07,761
Uh, it's not the chemical
kind of transference.

537
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,331
It's the
doctor-patient kind.

538
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,001
I'm dealing with
a personal situation.

539
00:29:14,067 --> 00:29:16,270
I don't think
the Internet is very helpful

540
00:29:16,336 --> 00:29:18,573
for solving
personal situations.

541
00:29:19,106 --> 00:29:20,708
True.

542
00:29:20,775 --> 00:29:23,009
But I can't exactly ask
Claire for her advice,

543
00:29:23,076 --> 00:29:24,846
and I barely know Park,
and Morgan...

544
00:29:24,912 --> 00:29:26,181
Morgan would be bad.

545
00:29:27,347 --> 00:29:28,716
Very bad.

546
00:29:33,788 --> 00:29:34,788
I'm a person.

547
00:29:36,891 --> 00:29:38,860
Yeah. No, no.
Yeah, of course, Shaun.

548
00:29:38,925 --> 00:29:40,595
I'd, uh,
I'd love your advice.

549
00:29:41,096 --> 00:29:42,096
Okay.

550
00:29:43,263 --> 00:29:46,533
Uh, so I think Celez,
my burn patient,

551
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:49,537
has feelings for me,
and I...

552
00:29:49,604 --> 00:29:52,105
...may have feelings
for her, too.

553
00:29:53,941 --> 00:29:56,443
But there's a good chance
her feelings aren't real,

554
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:59,913
and if they are real, then
they may not be permanent.

555
00:30:03,183 --> 00:30:05,552
Uh, you know, it's kind of
textbook transference.

556
00:30:05,619 --> 00:30:07,521
She's grateful
and she's vulnerable.

557
00:30:10,523 --> 00:30:14,595
And all I've ever known in my
life is unrequited love...

558
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:22,604
...from Claire
and from my parents.

559
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,709
And that makes me
vulnerable, too.

560
00:30:38,685 --> 00:30:39,788
You should
call in sick.

561
00:30:43,391 --> 00:30:46,661
Lea says calling in sick
is all you need

562
00:30:46,728 --> 00:30:48,863
to gain superior wisdom
and knowledge.

563
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:50,731
She was right.

564
00:31:02,076 --> 00:31:03,778
The CT showed
no abnormalities,

565
00:31:03,845 --> 00:31:06,381
and the reversal agents have
been repeated without effect.

566
00:31:08,383 --> 00:31:09,984
So what else
could it be?

567
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:14,487
Anoxic brain injury, a
complication of anesthesia.

568
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:19,127
Unfortunately,
we believe...

569
00:31:19,192 --> 00:31:20,627
...your daughter
is brain-dead.

570
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:25,865
What?

571
00:31:34,969 --> 00:31:35,969
All for a smile.

572
00:31:38,506 --> 00:31:40,908
I made her think she wasn't
good enough the way she was.

573
00:31:44,911 --> 00:31:46,079
I should've listened
to you.

574
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,248
Yes.

575
00:31:48,315 --> 00:31:51,251
There's just no predicting how
individuals will react to anesthesia.

576
00:31:51,853 --> 00:31:52,853
Yeah.

577
00:32:01,161 --> 00:32:03,229
Park! You just walked out
on that man.

578
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,231
The last thing
a grieving family member needs

579
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,500
is to see
their doctor tap out.

580
00:32:07,567 --> 00:32:10,570
Maybe she's still
under anesthesia.

581
00:32:12,873 --> 00:32:14,240
Succinylcholine.

582
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,343
It was one of the anesthetics
Gretchen was administered.

583
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,878
- Yeah.
- Now, what if she has

584
00:32:17,944 --> 00:32:20,380
a Plasma Cholinesterase
Deficiency?

585
00:32:20,448 --> 00:32:22,649
It'd mean her body couldn't
break down that specific drug.

586
00:32:22,716 --> 00:32:25,019
Complete deficiency
is extremely rare.

587
00:32:25,084 --> 00:32:26,219
I've never
personally seen it,

588
00:32:26,286 --> 00:32:27,888
and I don't know anyone
who has.

589
00:32:27,955 --> 00:32:31,124
Yeah, but if she does have it,
she's just gonna wake up.

590
00:32:35,528 --> 00:32:37,029
Should I tell
the father?

591
00:32:37,096 --> 00:32:38,431
No, not yet.

592
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,967
No way we're letting him
grieve twice.

593
00:32:44,537 --> 00:32:46,707
Your labs
are not improving.

594
00:32:46,774 --> 00:32:48,276
Your organs
are shutting down.

595
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:51,011
You're running
out of time.

596
00:32:53,947 --> 00:32:55,917
I'd like to stop
calling you "Lucy."

597
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:15,536
You're welcome...

598
00:33:16,503 --> 00:33:17,905
Beatrice.

599
00:33:26,013 --> 00:33:27,014
What are you doing?

600
00:33:28,248 --> 00:33:29,482
Corneal reflex.

601
00:33:32,986 --> 00:33:36,623
It's mediated by the nasociliary
branch of the ophthalmic branch.

602
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,599
What does it mean?

603
00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:47,834
It means we were wrong.

604
00:33:49,503 --> 00:33:50,504
She's gonna be
just fine.

605
00:33:56,142 --> 00:33:57,978
Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you.

606
00:33:59,613 --> 00:34:01,047
Thank you... Oh.

607
00:34:02,348 --> 00:34:03,350
Thank you, Dr. Murphy.

608
00:34:12,558 --> 00:34:14,393
Honey,
you're gonna be okay.

609
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,696
You're gonna be
just fine.

610
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:19,165
I was drawing a bath, and I
leaned over to turn it off,

611
00:34:19,232 --> 00:34:20,767
and I dropped
the pill bottle,

612
00:34:20,834 --> 00:34:22,469
and before
I could fish it out...

613
00:34:22,535 --> 00:34:25,205
All the pills were ruined.
So you need a refill.

614
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:27,007
My pain has made me
so clumsy.

615
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,410
Lucy, you're a liar

616
00:34:30,477 --> 00:34:32,779
and a cheat
and an addict.

617
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,551
We know about
the frequent prescriptions,

618
00:34:37,616 --> 00:34:39,953
the multiple doctors, and the
ever-recurring shingles.

619
00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:45,593
You have
a serious medical problem.

620
00:34:48,495 --> 00:34:49,863
Let me help you.

621
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,372
Three months?

622
00:34:58,437 --> 00:34:59,573
Hopefully.

623
00:34:59,638 --> 00:35:01,541
But we might
be able to give you

624
00:35:01,609 --> 00:35:04,143
a pretty good idea of what
you're gonna look like.

625
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:06,413
Those things by your ears
are neuro-stimulators.

626
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,949
When we activate them,
instant smile.

627
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,252
Sound good?

628
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,321
Dr. Murphy.

629
00:35:27,234 --> 00:35:29,036
It's your mother's smile.

630
00:35:29,102 --> 00:35:30,803
She seemed like
a good template.

631
00:35:34,073 --> 00:35:36,476
There is
no Duchenne Marker.

632
00:35:37,643 --> 00:35:39,080
Her smile is not real.

633
00:35:44,484 --> 00:35:46,353
Thank you. Thank you.

634
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:51,158
But all the other ones are.

635
00:35:56,096 --> 00:35:57,965
All the other ones are.

636
00:35:58,998 --> 00:36:00,600
I spoke
with Jim Ransler,

637
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:03,337
who made it very clear that
we owe him big time for this.

638
00:36:05,638 --> 00:36:07,140
Don't worry, Marcus,
I can handle him.

639
00:36:08,908 --> 00:36:10,776
I'm very impressed.

640
00:36:10,843 --> 00:36:13,679
It was all
very presidential of you.

641
00:36:13,747 --> 00:36:15,116
You really went
above and beyond.

642
00:36:16,317 --> 00:36:17,818
Yes, I did.

643
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,419
I thought
I was saving her life.

644
00:36:19,486 --> 00:36:20,587
Instead,
I nearly ended it.

645
00:36:24,491 --> 00:36:25,759
Celez, hi.

646
00:36:26,859 --> 00:36:29,595
This is the brilliant
Dr. Murphy.

647
00:36:29,663 --> 00:36:31,065
He'll be assuming your care
from here on,

648
00:36:32,364 --> 00:36:33,966
though I don't expect
you'll need much.

649
00:36:35,935 --> 00:36:36,937
I understand.

650
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,640
I don't think you do.

651
00:36:40,707 --> 00:36:42,777
You see, doctors aren't allowed
to date their patients.

652
00:36:48,582 --> 00:36:49,717
What are you
doing tomorrow?

653
00:36:50,517 --> 00:36:52,185
Uh, I'm calling in sick.

654
00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:01,694
I think you may still have
some friends here.

655
00:37:13,873 --> 00:37:16,343
I guess there is one upside
to all this.

656
00:37:19,044 --> 00:37:21,614
If she hadn't bought
the stolen insurance card,

657
00:37:21,681 --> 00:37:23,584
the real Lucy wouldn't be
in rehab right now.

658
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,855
Surprisingly nice.

659
00:37:28,922 --> 00:37:30,591
I told her what she needed
to hear to get help.

660
00:37:32,692 --> 00:37:34,094
Trust me, I get it.

661
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,695
Too soft, people take
advantage of you.

662
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:38,098
But with your
badass upbringing,

663
00:37:38,165 --> 00:37:39,366
no one messes with you.

664
00:37:40,734 --> 00:37:42,469
Upsides everywhere.

665
00:37:42,535 --> 00:37:46,405
You have way more street cred
than, say,

666
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:50,009
someone whose mom's
a Johns Hopkins cardiologist,

667
00:37:50,076 --> 00:37:51,477
whose dad's
a pathologist,

668
00:37:51,544 --> 00:37:54,147
and whose parents have been
happily married for 37 years.

669
00:37:58,018 --> 00:38:00,321
Coming from privilege,
zero respect.

670
00:38:02,388 --> 00:38:03,923
Must be really hard
to overcome.

671
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,462
- I'll call a code.
- No.

672
00:38:11,464 --> 00:38:12,798
There's nothing left
to save.

673
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,782
Time of death, 8:14 p.m.

674
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,162
I'll notify her son.

675
00:39:33,212 --> 00:39:34,214
Oh, hey.

676
00:39:34,279 --> 00:39:36,816
Um, my homies
decided to pop by

677
00:39:36,882 --> 00:39:38,817
and, uh,
play some Texas Hold'em,

678
00:39:38,884 --> 00:39:41,587
so I'm gonna have to take a
rain check on that pizza night.

679
00:39:41,654 --> 00:39:44,957
You got
a 70-inch flat-screen, too.

680
00:39:45,024 --> 00:39:47,993
Uh, no.
I borrowed yours.

681
00:39:49,663 --> 00:39:51,698
Makes no sense for us both
to have one, right?

682
00:39:51,765 --> 00:39:54,366
Plus homies got to watch
March Madness.

683
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,902
- Okay.
- Oh, um, sorry, amigo.

684
00:39:56,969 --> 00:39:58,404
It's four-player
Texas Hold'em.

685
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,442
I don't like poker anyway.

686
00:40:02,509 --> 00:40:03,643
Hey, Shaun.

687
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,645
Look, you're a great guy,

688
00:40:06,712 --> 00:40:09,548
um, but you got a few,

689
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:13,954
like, quirks, you know?

690
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,756
And that...

691
00:40:16,922 --> 00:40:17,924
It doesn't really...

692
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,694
...jive with
this kind of face time.

693
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,064
You get what I'm saying,
right?

694
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,570
I love you, man.

695
00:40:41,915 --> 00:40:45,451
I once drove a 300SL...

696
00:40:45,518 --> 00:40:49,422
Thank you.
A 300SL Gullwing.

697
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:50,656
On the road?

698
00:40:50,723 --> 00:40:53,926
No. For 200 feet
at the Concours d'Elegance.

699
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,895
Oh, in Pebble Beach.
That's just as cool.

700
00:40:55,962 --> 00:40:57,096
The car show,
you know it.

701
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,899
Of course, yeah.

702
00:40:58,966 --> 00:41:02,736
This year, they're featuring
a Rollston Coachwork display.

703
00:41:02,801 --> 00:41:04,770
Including the Mercedes SS?

704
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,205
- I don't know.
- Ah!

705
00:41:06,272 --> 00:41:07,306
But we should find out.

706
00:41:08,741 --> 00:41:09,743
Do you want to go?

707
00:41:11,145 --> 00:41:12,146
I couldn't.

708
00:41:13,113 --> 00:41:14,281
Yeah, no, I...

709
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:15,348
Why?

710
00:41:17,917 --> 00:41:18,918
No reason.

711
00:41:18,984 --> 00:41:21,053
I just... I just thought

712
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,589
that I should make that my first
response before I accepted.

713
00:41:28,995 --> 00:41:30,763
Can I get you
anything else?

714
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:33,500
No, thank you. We'll
just take the doorstop.

715
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:40,238
I'm sorry. Um, well...

716
00:41:40,306 --> 00:41:42,108
Well, you can bring
the doorstop.

717
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,214
Aaron?

718
00:41:48,415 --> 00:41:49,416
Sorry. Um...

719
00:41:51,185 --> 00:41:52,186
The thing...

720
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:57,257
The thing... The thing...
The thing that... That...

721
00:41:57,323 --> 00:41:59,692
That t-tells you how much
to pay, the... The doorstop.

722
00:42:07,033 --> 00:42:08,067
Could you call a...

723
00:42:08,134 --> 00:42:09,134
Can you call
an ambulance, please?

724
00:42:09,201 --> 00:42:10,469
- Mmm-hmm.
- Thank you.
