1
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,846
Autism... a mental condition

2
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:07,934
characterized by
difficulty in communicating.

3
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:10,592
Does it sound like
I'm describing a surgeon?

4
00:00:10,617 --> 00:00:11,788
You saved his life.

5
00:00:11,813 --> 00:00:13,246
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

6
00:00:13,364 --> 00:00:15,166
Never forget, you're the smart one

7
00:00:15,168 --> 00:00:16,411
and I'm proud of you, Shaun.

8
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:18,512
My brother went to Heaven...

9
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:22,981
...in front of my eyes.

10
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:24,915
He's got a serious deficit.

11
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,145
We hire Shaun,

12
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,417
and we give hope to those people
with limitations

13
00:00:28,442 --> 00:00:29,909
that those limitations

14
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:31,874
are not what they think they are,

15
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,796
that they do have a shot!

16
00:00:33,836 --> 00:00:38,171
If Shaun doesn't live up
to everything I know he can do,

17
00:00:38,173 --> 00:00:41,675
I will resign my position
as president of this hospital.

18
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,596
Where to?

19
00:02:02,661 --> 00:02:05,091
San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital.

20
00:02:05,093 --> 00:02:08,006
I'm a surgical resident.
Today is my first full day.

21
00:02:08,265 --> 00:02:09,898
I meant floor.

22
00:02:10,065 --> 00:02:11,298
Oh, ground floor.

23
00:02:13,335 --> 00:02:14,935
I'm taking the bus.

This is Mitchell Brand, 55 years old,

26
00:02:30,085 --> 00:02:32,285
post-op day one
from a radical prostatectomy.

27
00:02:32,287 --> 00:02:34,454
Morning, Mitchell. I'm Dr. Melendez.

28
00:02:34,456 --> 00:02:36,823
These are my residents
Dr. Browne and Dr. Kalu.

29
00:02:36,825 --> 00:02:38,225
Your surgery went perfectly.

30
00:02:38,227 --> 00:02:39,226
Yeah.

31
00:02:39,228 --> 00:02:41,494
Am I ever gonna walk again?

32
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:43,697
Yes. Of course.

33
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:45,932
This is Mitchell Brand.
I reviewed his chart.

34
00:02:45,934 --> 00:02:48,101
He's 55 years old from Chicago,

35
00:02:48,103 --> 00:02:49,436
divorced with two children.

36
00:02:49,438 --> 00:02:51,938
You did a radical prostatectomy
on him yesterday.

37
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,440
There are many possible complications

38
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,008
but none related to motor neurons.

39
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,110
There is no chance
you won't be able to walk.

40
00:03:00,015 --> 00:03:02,616
He... he wasn't worried about his legs.

41
00:03:05,187 --> 00:03:06,686
Oh, yes.

42
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:09,670
There's a significant chance
of impotence.

43
00:03:10,025 --> 00:03:11,825
Dr. Murphy, you're late.

44
00:03:11,827 --> 00:03:13,625
No, the bus was late.

45
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,829
The schedule was clear.
They post it online.

46
00:03:15,854 --> 00:03:17,330
But the 4 bus was late which meant...

47
00:03:17,332 --> 00:03:18,945
- You're late.
- Five minutes, we've all been...

48
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:22,028
On your first day, no less.
It is your responsibility to be here.

49
00:03:22,053 --> 00:03:24,070
if you are not, you have failed
in your responsibility,

50
00:03:24,072 --> 00:03:27,122
- which makes it your fault.
- Okay, how can it be my fault?

51
00:03:27,147 --> 00:03:28,895
- I did nothing wrong. The bus...
- Yeah.

52
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,012
This is gonna work out great.

53
00:03:30,037 --> 00:03:31,978
The board clearly made
the right choice in hiring you.

54
00:03:32,606 --> 00:03:34,154
Thank you.

55
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:37,562
Dr. Melendez, we've got
an emergent consult in the E.R.

56
00:03:38,444 --> 00:03:39,576
You should be fine

57
00:03:39,601 --> 00:03:41,284
if you can leave it alone
for a couple days.

58
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:44,090
Four days of indigestion,

59
00:03:44,092 --> 00:03:45,992
bloating, constipation, and nausea.

60
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,154
And a lot of pain, apparently.

61
00:03:48,178 --> 00:03:49,443
Yeah.

62
00:03:49,468 --> 00:03:51,831
- Did you give her morphine?
- Yeah, 10 milligrams.

63
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:52,901
Hasn't touched her pain.

64
00:03:54,102 --> 00:03:55,402
You have time to get a CT?

65
00:03:55,404 --> 00:03:57,270
Yeah. That's why I called you.

66
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,543
That's very big.

67
00:04:05,146 --> 00:04:06,279
Yes, it is.

68
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:08,148
What are we looking at?

69
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,517
It's definitely abutting
the aorta and the left kidney.

70
00:04:10,555 --> 00:04:12,938
Renal angiomyolipoma?

71
00:04:13,057 --> 00:04:15,867
- Do you see an extensive blood supply?
- No.

72
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,282
Maybe some kind of neurogenic tumor.

73
00:04:18,307 --> 00:04:19,829
Or maybe a lymphoma.

74
00:04:19,831 --> 00:04:22,431
She has a sarcoma, a malignant tumor.

75
00:04:23,454 --> 00:04:24,688
Malignant?

76
00:04:24,713 --> 00:04:26,640
- That means it's killing me, right?
- Yes.

77
00:04:26,665 --> 00:04:28,971
Not necessarily.
We're just speculating right now.

78
00:04:28,973 --> 00:04:30,793
No. It's definitely malignant.

79
00:04:30,818 --> 00:04:31,928
If it weren't malignant...

80
00:04:31,953 --> 00:04:34,377
- Please stop saying "malignant."
- Should we talk outside?

81
00:04:37,288 --> 00:04:40,015
Give her more morphine.
As much as she wants.

82
00:04:40,017 --> 00:04:41,584
Okay.

83
00:04:44,187 --> 00:04:46,080
You scared her.

84
00:04:46,457 --> 00:04:48,657
- Didn't need to be so blunt.
- Why?

85
00:04:50,034 --> 00:04:51,494
Her prognosis is terminal

86
00:04:51,496 --> 00:04:53,229
without immediate medical intervention.

87
00:04:53,254 --> 00:04:54,330
Isn't that scary?

88
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:57,199
Well...

89
00:04:57,201 --> 00:04:58,968
That fear does her no good.

90
00:05:00,048 --> 00:05:02,671
Does she have a malignant sarcoma?

91
00:05:02,923 --> 00:05:05,207
Are we gonna be doing a laparotomy?

92
00:05:06,676 --> 00:05:08,911
We need intra-operative staging
for the biopsy,

93
00:05:08,913 --> 00:05:10,980
extensive dissection
of the retroperitoneum,

94
00:05:10,982 --> 00:05:13,506
and excision of the mass
with wide, clear margins.

95
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:15,812
I want in.

96
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:17,019
You do know you're drooling, right?

97
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:19,021
About cutting open a 40-year-old woman.

98
00:05:19,023 --> 00:05:20,655
Real person. Right behind that door.

99
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,811
It's called bedside manner...

100
00:05:21,836 --> 00:05:23,459
no such thing as
outside-the-door manner.

101
00:05:23,461 --> 00:05:25,155
It is exciting, Claire.

102
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,396
We'd be saving a life,
and we'd be learning.

103
00:05:27,398 --> 00:05:28,628
See?

104
00:05:28,653 --> 00:05:30,699
Dr. Browne, you're my number two.

105
00:05:31,777 --> 00:05:34,203
- With all due respect, doctor...
- Comments that start that way

106
00:05:34,205 --> 00:05:35,704
rarely come across that way.

107
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,808
- I was gonna say that's an excellent call.
- Thank you.

108
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,544
- Jared, prep the surgical team.
- Sir, what do I do?

109
00:05:44,614 --> 00:05:46,979
- Scut work.
- What's scut work?

110
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,891
Today, I'm gonna need my surgeons
to have no distractions.

111
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,456
So I'm gonna need you
to handle those distractions.

112
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,423
All the work they do every day

113
00:05:54,425 --> 00:05:55,389
that they hate doing,

114
00:05:55,574 --> 00:05:57,349
you're handling it for them.

115
00:06:07,104 --> 00:06:09,371
Make sure they know we
still need a consent on that one.

116
00:06:15,312 --> 00:06:16,579
Am I being punished for something?

117
00:06:16,749 --> 00:06:18,380
No.

118
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:20,416
Okay.

119
00:06:21,437 --> 00:06:22,818
So that's it?

120
00:06:22,976 --> 00:06:25,421
You just accept my answer at face value?

121
00:06:25,757 --> 00:06:26,956
Why?

122
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,573
You're very arrogant.

123
00:06:30,215 --> 00:06:32,316
Arrogant people don't think
they need to lie.

124
00:06:32,654 --> 00:06:35,021
So you must be doing this to teach me.

125
00:06:35,107 --> 00:06:37,141
I look forward to learning
from scut work.

126
00:06:42,022 --> 00:06:45,117
- Say "Ahh."
- Ahhh.

127
00:06:45,142 --> 00:06:46,475
How long will this be?

128
00:06:46,477 --> 00:06:48,298
Seven minutes.

129
00:06:48,946 --> 00:06:51,321
Without any complications,
it takes seven minutes

130
00:06:51,346 --> 00:06:53,482
to do a discharge examination properly.

131
00:06:53,484 --> 00:06:55,523
Dr. Dunsmuir
has already cleared him to go

132
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,086
- and we need the bed.
- Okay.

133
00:06:57,088 --> 00:06:59,476
Protocol requires that
the surgical department

134
00:06:59,501 --> 00:07:00,923
also clears him.

135
00:07:03,493 --> 00:07:05,210
You have an ear infection.

136
00:07:05,235 --> 00:07:06,662
Yes, that's why he's here.

137
00:07:06,664 --> 00:07:08,364
My hearing's been a little muffled,

138
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:09,832
and I've had some ringing.

139
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:11,169
They gave him amoxicillin.

140
00:07:11,194 --> 00:07:12,801
And we're sending him home.

141
00:07:12,803 --> 00:07:14,203
Which is why you're here.

142
00:07:14,205 --> 00:07:16,137
To send him home.

143
00:07:16,162 --> 00:07:17,290
I'd like an MRI

144
00:07:17,315 --> 00:07:19,275
of the head
and internal auditory meatus.

145
00:07:19,277 --> 00:07:20,643
I'm not being discharged?

146
00:07:20,645 --> 00:07:22,144
What do you think is wrong?

147
00:07:24,615 --> 00:07:26,539
I'll tell you when I know for sure.

148
00:07:26,617 --> 00:07:28,551
I don't want to scare you.

149
00:07:40,273 --> 00:07:41,605
Shaun.

150
00:07:41,732 --> 00:07:42,965
What are you doing down here?

151
00:07:43,327 --> 00:07:45,301
I'm waiting for her to fart.

152
00:07:47,705 --> 00:07:48,938
Flatulence.

153
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,924
But I'm using the word "fart"
in front of the patient

154
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:52,157
to be more casual.

155
00:07:52,182 --> 00:07:53,744
But you're the president
of the hospital,

156
00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:55,044
so I'll say "flatulence" to you.

157
00:07:55,914 --> 00:07:57,415
Well, I appreciate that.

158
00:07:57,488 --> 00:07:59,354
Why are you doing that?

159
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,441
She had her deviated septum repaired.

160
00:08:01,442 --> 00:08:02,558
Before we can release her,

161
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,852
we have to be sure she isn't suffering

162
00:08:03,854 --> 00:08:05,120
from post-operative ileus.

163
00:08:05,122 --> 00:08:06,989
Ah.

164
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:10,523
This is what Dr. Melendez feels

165
00:08:10,548 --> 00:08:12,995
you'll be most useful doing today?

166
00:08:12,997 --> 00:08:14,633
Waiting for farts?

167
00:08:14,658 --> 00:08:17,266
- I'm not just waiting for farts.
- Thank goodness.

168
00:08:17,268 --> 00:08:19,001
I'm doing all the scut work.

169
00:08:21,028 --> 00:08:23,192
Well...

170
00:08:23,217 --> 00:08:25,484
Welcome to your surgical residency.

171
00:08:27,845 --> 00:08:28,877
Thank you.

172
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:33,824
There. I think that was it.

173
00:08:37,943 --> 00:08:39,843
I don't think so.

174
00:08:40,057 --> 00:08:41,879
I'll wait a little longer.

175
00:08:41,949 --> 00:08:43,292
This is important.

176
00:08:46,631 --> 00:08:49,738
The procedure is called a laparotomy.

177
00:08:49,944 --> 00:08:52,035
Mm.

178
00:08:53,237 --> 00:08:55,433
Yeah, your heart sounds good.

179
00:08:55,777 --> 00:08:58,324
So, we make a long incision
down the middle of your abdomen,

180
00:08:58,409 --> 00:09:00,509
- expose the tumor...
- Am I going to die?

181
00:09:03,213 --> 00:09:06,581
Dr. Melendez is the best surgeon
I have ever seen...

182
00:09:06,606 --> 00:09:08,839
Can this all wait?

183
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,068
You have a very serious condition.
It's not advisable to...

184
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:14,748
Just a couple of weeks.
My son is getting married next weekend.

185
00:09:15,457 --> 00:09:17,256
They look very happy.

186
00:09:17,461 --> 00:09:19,228
After the initial incision...

187
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,530
They've been planning this for months.

188
00:09:21,532 --> 00:09:22,765
If they have to reschedule...

189
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:25,423
Well... well, this...
this is complicated surgery,

190
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:26,969
but if all goes well,

191
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:28,437
recovery is pretty easy.

192
00:09:28,439 --> 00:09:31,124
No need to reschedule anything.

193
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:32,808
And if it doesn't?

194
00:09:33,093 --> 00:09:34,910
If it doesn't go well?

195
00:09:39,383 --> 00:09:41,357
My husband died in a car accident

196
00:09:41,452 --> 00:09:43,294
a couple of years ago.

197
00:09:44,455 --> 00:09:46,802
Mark is our only child.

198
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,025
I can't die right before his wedding.

199
00:09:50,197 --> 00:09:51,960
I can't.

200
00:09:53,774 --> 00:09:55,845
You're not gonna die.

201
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,996
You will be at the wedding.

202
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,148
Looking beautiful.

203
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,613
You're not supposed to make
promises like that, Dr. Browne.

204
00:10:11,615 --> 00:10:13,582
Yeah, I told her
what she needed to hear.

205
00:10:13,584 --> 00:10:16,069
Officially, our legal
department's policy is...

206
00:10:16,094 --> 00:10:18,483
tell the ugly truth...
the uglier the better.

207
00:10:18,508 --> 00:10:20,214
Is that what you did?
I don't think that's what you did.

208
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:21,738
Yeah, well, it's a dumb policy.

209
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:23,136
She needs to have the surgery.

210
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:24,581
Scaring her would change nothing.

211
00:10:24,606 --> 00:10:26,007
Right, because a much better policy

212
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,522
would be to lie to all of our patients

213
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:28,731
whenever it makes you feel better.

214
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:30,116
No, it doesn't make me feel better.

215
00:10:30,141 --> 00:10:31,667
It makes her feel better.

216
00:10:34,862 --> 00:10:36,045
I'm pathetic.

217
00:10:38,007 --> 00:10:40,283
- What?
- I am pathetic.

218
00:10:40,353 --> 00:10:42,111
And here's my thinking, so just...

219
00:10:42,136 --> 00:10:45,517
just bear with me, because
it kind of insults both of us.

220
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,817
You met that woman an hour ago,
and you lied to her.

221
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:51,787
A pity lie because you
obviously care about her.

222
00:10:51,789 --> 00:10:55,624
A pity lie that has absolutely
zero upside for you,

223
00:10:55,626 --> 00:10:57,740
but I can't make you,
the world's softest touch,

224
00:10:57,765 --> 00:10:59,628
care about me.

225
00:11:09,874 --> 00:11:11,840
Hey.

226
00:11:16,914 --> 00:11:19,310
I need a consult.

227
00:11:19,904 --> 00:11:22,137
What? You have a question about this?

228
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:23,886
This patient is perfectly healthy.

229
00:11:23,888 --> 00:11:25,424
There's not even any artifact
in these images.

230
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:28,524
Yeah, which in turn raises an
interesting medical question...

231
00:11:28,526 --> 00:11:31,338
why the hell did this patient
get an MRI?

232
00:11:31,662 --> 00:11:33,228
I don't know anything about this.

233
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,123
Yeah. Someone on your team ordered it.

234
00:11:35,148 --> 00:11:37,332
It's your responsibility,
which makes it your fault.

235
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:39,968
What... How did you...?

236
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,404
It's my department.
It's my job to know everything.

237
00:11:42,406 --> 00:11:44,652
Well, then, since I work for you,

238
00:11:44,677 --> 00:11:46,475
doesn't that make all of this
actually your fault?

239
00:11:46,477 --> 00:11:49,419
Oh, I'm sorry, I stopped listening
after "I work for you."

240
00:11:53,617 --> 00:11:55,017
Does that hurt?

241
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:56,084
Yes.

242
00:11:57,287 --> 00:11:58,287
Does that hurt?

243
00:11:58,392 --> 00:11:59,915
Yes.

244
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,490
Does that hurt?

245
00:12:01,492 --> 00:12:03,687
How much are we paying for this?
She has a tummy ache.

246
00:12:03,712 --> 00:12:05,027
- That's what they do... they ache.
- Shh.

247
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:07,068
She's just trying to get
out of school. Again.

248
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,564
Where do you think
she learned that from?

249
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:10,265
You don't think she hears you
calling in sick to work

250
00:12:10,267 --> 00:12:11,433
right before you go golfing?

251
00:12:11,435 --> 00:12:13,235
I like school.

252
00:12:13,387 --> 00:12:14,653
Me too.

253
00:12:14,678 --> 00:12:16,338
What did you eat for dinner last night?

254
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,106
Cereal.

255
00:12:18,108 --> 00:12:19,408
- I thought you made meatloaf.
- I did.

256
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,276
And it got cold while
we were waiting for you.

257
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:23,600
I want D-dimer, lactate, and amylase...

258
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:24,913
What tests are you ordering?

259
00:12:24,915 --> 00:12:27,916
D-dimer, lactate, and amylase.

260
00:12:27,941 --> 00:12:30,512
- For a tummy ache? Hmm?
- Yes.

261
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,916
I'm concerned it may be...

262
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,555
Shall we talk outside?

263
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,967
I told you something was wrong.

264
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:40,662
You're happy she might be sick?

265
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:41,730
I'm happy you're wrong.

266
00:12:41,732 --> 00:12:43,498
Yeah. Let's talk outside.

267
00:12:46,496 --> 00:12:48,651
Have they been bickering
like that the whole time?

268
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:51,276
I didn't notice. They aren't sick.

269
00:12:51,323 --> 00:12:53,503
- Yeah, they're what we call a vector.
- Hmm?

270
00:12:53,528 --> 00:12:55,744
A carrier. A cause of disease.

271
00:12:55,831 --> 00:12:57,779
- You mean the parents?
- Yeah.

272
00:12:57,781 --> 00:12:59,381
That little girl has a tummy ache

273
00:12:59,383 --> 00:13:01,183
because mommy and daddy
won't stop fighting.

274
00:13:01,185 --> 00:13:03,051
This isn't a medical issue.
Send them home.

275
00:13:03,076 --> 00:13:04,720
Could be intestinal malrotation,

276
00:13:04,722 --> 00:13:06,221
which could quickly become fatal.

277
00:13:06,223 --> 00:13:08,490
And every patient in this
hospital could have malaria,

278
00:13:08,492 --> 00:13:10,425
but that doesn't mean
we're gonna go around testing

279
00:13:10,427 --> 00:13:12,094
for every condition
we think they could have.

280
00:13:12,096 --> 00:13:13,695
For example, that MRI you ordered

281
00:13:13,697 --> 00:13:15,397
on the guy with the ear infection?

282
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,531
Nice call, genius.

283
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:18,166
Thank you.

284
00:13:18,168 --> 00:13:19,368
I was being sarcastic.

285
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,803
It's normal. He's healthy.
Send him home, too.

286
00:13:23,807 --> 00:13:25,073
Why are you smiling?

287
00:13:25,075 --> 00:13:26,208
Because you're right.

288
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:28,227
So you thought he was making a mistake

289
00:13:28,252 --> 00:13:29,613
and didn't say anything?

290
00:13:29,638 --> 00:13:31,818
Just stood by watching, taking notes

291
00:13:31,843 --> 00:13:33,537
while he wasted everybody's time?

292
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,883
Is that your job?

293
00:13:35,318 --> 00:13:37,731
In my experience,
doctors don't listen to nurses.

294
00:13:37,756 --> 00:13:39,332
And they only talk to us to lecture us

295
00:13:39,357 --> 00:13:40,956
when they figure
we screwed something up.

296
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,562
From now on, you don't run any tests

297
00:13:47,564 --> 00:13:48,530
you don't have to run.

298
00:13:48,532 --> 00:13:50,332
How do I know if a test is needed

299
00:13:50,334 --> 00:13:51,500
until after I run it?

300
00:13:52,603 --> 00:13:53,969
She'll tell you.

301
00:13:53,971 --> 00:13:56,138
Today, she's your boss.

302
00:14:12,714 --> 00:14:15,018
I could never eat before surgery.

303
00:14:15,151 --> 00:14:18,134
Puke? I could do that.

304
00:14:18,369 --> 00:14:19,969
I get cranky if I don't eat.

305
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,590
- I hear Shaun made the call.
- Mm.

306
00:14:23,628 --> 00:14:25,461
He's an excellent diagnostician.

307
00:14:25,463 --> 00:14:27,463
You should get him a job in radiology.

308
00:14:27,465 --> 00:14:29,332
He doesn't want to be a radiologist.

309
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:30,854
He wants to be a surgeon.

310
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:32,713
That's what we hired him to be.

311
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:36,005
That's what I worked damn hard
to hire him to be.

312
00:14:36,007 --> 00:14:37,707
Not a glorified orderly.

313
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:39,438
Every resident does scut work.

314
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:41,644
So you're treating him
like anybody else?

315
00:14:41,646 --> 00:14:43,646
- Are you?
- Yes, yes, I am.

316
00:14:43,648 --> 00:14:45,681
He more than earned the right
to be here.

317
00:14:45,683 --> 00:14:47,650
He has had to get past people like you

318
00:14:47,652 --> 00:14:49,719
and their prejudices
every step of the way.

319
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:51,909
- Prejudices?
- Yeah, prejudices.

320
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:53,589
You have any idea how many patients

321
00:14:53,591 --> 00:14:54,991
he's scared the crap out of today?

322
00:14:54,993 --> 00:14:57,093
How many wasted tests he ordered?

323
00:14:57,095 --> 00:14:58,261
So teach him.

324
00:14:58,263 --> 00:14:59,526
I'm doing that.

325
00:14:59,697 --> 00:15:02,245
I'm teaching you both
that he doesn't belong.

326
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,234
Okay.

327
00:15:05,236 --> 00:15:08,300
You're gonna make me pull rank,
I will pull rank.

328
00:15:08,495 --> 00:15:10,290
This is my hospital.

329
00:15:10,393 --> 00:15:12,469
But it's my team.

330
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:14,582
You can't tell me how to run my team.

331
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,373
Hey.

332
00:15:26,524 --> 00:15:27,890
How are you doing?

333
00:15:27,892 --> 00:15:29,792
What's the point of sarcasm?

334
00:15:30,255 --> 00:15:31,894
Um...

335
00:15:32,362 --> 00:15:33,563
Well, uh...

336
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:37,505
Like, sometimes,
it's a way of critiquing people

337
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,202
in a way that's funny

338
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:40,770
so they don't feel quite so bad.

339
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:42,271
Isn't it just lying?

340
00:15:42,273 --> 00:15:43,973
Mm, well, it's not lying,

341
00:15:43,975 --> 00:15:46,008
because people know you're lying.

342
00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:48,867
I'm not good at that.

343
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:52,148
You may remember me from last year.

344
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,783
We sell chocolate bars every year

345
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:55,818
to pay for our class trip
to Mt. Rushmore.

346
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,186
Okay.

347
00:15:57,188 --> 00:15:59,021
But this year we're not
going to Mt. Rushmore,

348
00:15:59,023 --> 00:16:01,424
because Kenny can't go.

349
00:16:01,426 --> 00:16:02,859
He's got cancer.

350
00:16:03,742 --> 00:16:05,546
So, Samantha had the idea

351
00:16:05,571 --> 00:16:07,663
that if he can't go,
none of us would go,

352
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:09,465
and we all thought
that was a great idea.

353
00:16:09,467 --> 00:16:11,834
So, we're gonna have a party
at the hospital for him.

354
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,444
There are two Kennys in your class.

355
00:16:15,584 --> 00:16:17,295
Is it Kenny L. or Kenny M.?

356
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,086
No one's sick.

357
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,310
Well, you lied?

358
00:16:20,411 --> 00:16:22,144
- You weren't supposed to lie.
- Yeah.

359
00:16:22,146 --> 00:16:23,993
And you and me aren't
supposed to starve.

360
00:16:24,018 --> 00:16:25,284
We need money for food.

361
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,961
Was any of that true?

362
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:29,485
Yeah.

363
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:31,020
We're not going to Mt. Rushmore.

364
00:16:37,227 --> 00:16:38,427
I can't discharge people

365
00:16:38,429 --> 00:16:40,196
if I think they might still be sick.

366
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:42,665
Um, of course not. Why would you?

367
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:45,668
Dr. Melendez made Nurse Fryday
my boss today.

368
00:16:46,121 --> 00:16:48,437
Should I speak to Dr. Glassman?

369
00:16:48,489 --> 00:16:50,293
No.

370
00:16:50,613 --> 00:16:52,713
What did you think this job was?

371
00:16:52,777 --> 00:16:54,354
To save people's lives.

372
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:55,444
No.

373
00:16:55,446 --> 00:16:58,961
I mean, yeah,
sometimes we do save lives.

374
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,031
But the job...

375
00:17:01,234 --> 00:17:03,552
It's doing whatever
Melendez asks us to do.

376
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,697
Paging Dr. Browne.

377
00:17:06,752 --> 00:17:09,502
Paging Dr. Browne to the O.R.

378
00:17:17,463 --> 00:17:18,935
I'm Dr. Claire Browne.

379
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:19,969
I'm first assist today,

380
00:17:19,994 --> 00:17:21,659
and I'll be leading the timeout.

381
00:17:21,684 --> 00:17:24,618
Patient's name, Stephanie Willis.

382
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:26,175
Scheduled surgery?

383
00:17:26,177 --> 00:17:28,577
Excision of an indeterminate
retroperitoneal tumor.

384
00:17:28,579 --> 00:17:31,822
We don't anticipate any
complications with the surgery.

385
00:17:31,847 --> 00:17:33,647
Thank you, Dr. Browne.

386
00:17:33,818 --> 00:17:34,984
Ten blade.

387
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:46,429
Let's remove a tumor.

388
00:17:50,435 --> 00:17:51,701
Excuse me.

389
00:17:55,945 --> 00:17:57,048
No.

390
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:00,810
It might be infected.

391
00:18:00,812 --> 00:18:03,221
- It's not.
- There is some discoloration.

392
00:18:03,246 --> 00:18:06,015
He's 82 years old.
Everything is discolored.

393
00:18:13,331 --> 00:18:15,858
Once we get through the muscle layer,
proceed carefully.

394
00:18:16,284 --> 00:18:18,815
Blood pressure, 120 over 70.

395
00:18:18,863 --> 00:18:19,962
Heart rate 60.

396
00:18:19,964 --> 00:18:21,263
She's holding steady.

397
00:18:22,697 --> 00:18:24,297
I've opened the facia.

398
00:18:26,247 --> 00:18:28,548
You kept your puke?

399
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:31,440
Yeah, I thought you'd want to see it.

400
00:18:31,442 --> 00:18:34,276
It looks like puke.

401
00:18:34,278 --> 00:18:36,445
No. No, no. It's not the regular color.

402
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,614
Your puke has a regular color?

403
00:18:38,616 --> 00:18:39,682
Yeah.

404
00:18:39,684 --> 00:18:41,517
It is a bit of an unusual color.

405
00:18:42,012 --> 00:18:44,067
We could order some...

406
00:18:45,645 --> 00:18:47,567
I'm sending you home.

407
00:18:47,716 --> 00:18:49,683
You sure?

408
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:51,460
It... It's safe for me to go home?

409
00:18:53,344 --> 00:18:54,544
I don't know what to say.

410
00:18:54,881 --> 00:18:56,529
You'll learn.

411
00:18:56,654 --> 00:18:57,900
By doing.

412
00:19:06,022 --> 00:19:07,356
Hi.

413
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,648
My brother said
there's a kid named Kenny,

414
00:19:12,673 --> 00:19:14,417
and he's sick, and there might...

415
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:15,518
you should give us money.

416
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,289
So, am I okay?

417
00:19:22,481 --> 00:19:24,148
Am... Am I okay?

418
00:19:24,604 --> 00:19:26,578
According to all hospital rules

419
00:19:26,603 --> 00:19:29,065
and direct instructions
given to me, yes.

420
00:19:33,665 --> 00:19:34,954
But...

421
00:19:38,776 --> 00:19:40,009
Whoa.

422
00:19:40,011 --> 00:19:42,660
We need a better exposure of this tumor.

423
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:47,451
Let's get the deep Balfour in here.

424
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:50,293
Deep Balfour retractor.

425
00:19:51,322 --> 00:19:54,056
Let's get this thing open.
I've got to see where it's safe to cut.

426
00:19:54,368 --> 00:19:56,735
Yeah. Thanks.

427
00:19:57,081 --> 00:19:59,929
I can't see anywhere where this
tumor hasn't encased her arteries.

428
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:01,287
Claire, tell me you got something.

429
00:20:01,312 --> 00:20:02,565
I've got nothing.

430
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:05,034
This tumor is way bigger
than it looked on the scans.

431
00:20:07,576 --> 00:20:11,174
I...I can't even see her aorta.

432
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,976
That's a problem.

433
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:43,701
Is that the girl
with the bickering parents?

434
00:20:43,726 --> 00:20:46,381
Didn't we send her home four hours ago?

435
00:20:49,008 --> 00:20:51,431
Dr. Murphy,
Dr. Melendez needs you in surgery.

436
00:20:58,673 --> 00:21:00,740
That won't be necessary.

437
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,558
The tumor's entirely encased
the large abdominal arteries.

438
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,739
That's very bad.

439
00:21:11,764 --> 00:21:13,028
If it's in the artery walls,

440
00:21:13,053 --> 00:21:15,797
it's going to be impossible
to cut out without killing her.

441
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:18,399
You should get a biopsy to determine
where the margins are.

442
00:21:18,437 --> 00:21:20,070
Thank you.

443
00:21:20,296 --> 00:21:21,739
You're welcome.

444
00:21:21,741 --> 00:21:23,841
I was being sarcastic... again.

445
00:21:24,467 --> 00:21:26,110
Oh, I-I see,

446
00:21:26,112 --> 00:21:28,045
because you are already know
everything I said,

447
00:21:28,047 --> 00:21:30,264
and you already sent a biopsy
to the lab?

448
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,316
Yes, 'cause I'm a doctor, too.

449
00:21:32,514 --> 00:21:34,648
Yes. But you need me?

450
00:21:34,673 --> 00:21:36,249
Yeah, I need you to run down to the lab

451
00:21:36,274 --> 00:21:37,773
and hurry them along.

452
00:21:53,873 --> 00:21:55,580
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

453
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,205
I'm a surgical resident.

454
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,976
Dr. Melendez sent you a biopsy.

455
00:21:58,978 --> 00:22:00,611
When will the results be ready?

456
00:22:00,613 --> 00:22:02,079
When I get to it.

457
00:22:02,081 --> 00:22:03,781
It's very important.

458
00:22:03,783 --> 00:22:05,215
They're all very important.

459
00:22:06,822 --> 00:22:08,774
Let me see the other test orders.

460
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,621
I'll tell you which ones
are most important,

461
00:22:10,623 --> 00:22:12,356
and you can do them in that order.

462
00:22:12,358 --> 00:22:13,991
I'll be honest and fair.

463
00:22:14,485 --> 00:22:17,261
That is not the way that it works.

464
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:19,084
Now go wait your turn.

465
00:22:23,535 --> 00:22:24,802
Do it again.

466
00:22:33,971 --> 00:22:37,330
- Get the hell away from me, you moron.
- Let's get out of here!

467
00:22:39,518 --> 00:22:40,884
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

468
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,499
If you want to get
anything in life, Shaun,

469
00:22:44,524 --> 00:22:45,956
there's one thing you got to do.

470
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,524
Never be afraid.

471
00:22:49,361 --> 00:22:50,461
You're the moron!

472
00:23:07,661 --> 00:23:10,914
If you don't do
Dr. Melendez's test right now,

473
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:12,816
I will throw a rock through your window.

474
00:23:18,389 --> 00:23:20,516
Well, I wouldn't want that.

475
00:23:22,928 --> 00:23:24,423
Go have a seat.

476
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:26,712
Your results will be ready
in 15 minutes.

477
00:23:37,443 --> 00:23:38,842
You got a minute?

478
00:23:38,844 --> 00:23:40,731
I have a patient lying in the O.R.

479
00:23:40,756 --> 00:23:42,189
waiting for lab results,

480
00:23:42,214 --> 00:23:43,680
and I'm sitting here
trying to figure out

481
00:23:43,682 --> 00:23:45,883
what the hell I'm gonna do next,
and I don't like any of my options,

482
00:23:45,885 --> 00:23:48,911
so... yeah, unfortunately it seems I do.

483
00:23:49,121 --> 00:23:50,721
Okay, we can talk another time.

484
00:23:50,723 --> 00:23:51,922
Glassman talked to you?

485
00:23:54,176 --> 00:23:56,727
I don't have a problem
with an autistic doctor.

486
00:23:56,729 --> 00:23:58,723
No, you just have a problem
with one working for you.

487
00:23:58,748 --> 00:24:00,297
Really? That's how you see me?

488
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:02,036
Let's not make this personal.

489
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:04,228
You're accusing me of prejudice.

490
00:24:04,403 --> 00:24:06,069
I have a problem with the doctor

491
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:07,971
who has a problem with communication.

492
00:24:07,973 --> 00:24:12,009
Okay, let's make this personal.

493
00:24:13,946 --> 00:24:15,312
Who do you respect at this hospital?

494
00:24:15,314 --> 00:24:18,212
You and Glassman.

495
00:24:18,393 --> 00:24:20,159
And who do you not respect?

496
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,377
And does it bother you

497
00:24:25,457 --> 00:24:27,658
that it looks like
you're on the wrong team?

498
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:32,097
If the tumor hasn't invaded
into the arterial walls,

499
00:24:32,122 --> 00:24:33,855
we could create a plane of dissection.

500
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:36,104
Well, if it's a noninvasive liposarcoma

501
00:24:36,129 --> 00:24:37,734
we can work it off from the outside.

502
00:24:37,736 --> 00:24:39,536
Blunt dissection and tissue forceps...

503
00:24:39,538 --> 00:24:40,938
peel it off piece by piece.

504
00:24:50,793 --> 00:24:53,405
It's a leiomyosarcoma.

505
00:24:54,887 --> 00:24:57,220
Well, that sucks.

506
00:24:57,222 --> 00:24:59,389
- Yes, it's sad.
- The surgery's impossible.

507
00:24:59,733 --> 00:25:02,865
Well, might as well wake her up...

508
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:05,238
let her know she has
three months to live,

509
00:25:05,318 --> 00:25:07,151
offer palliative care.

510
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,901
The surgery isn't impossible...

511
00:25:16,108 --> 00:25:19,033
just, very, very, very difficult.

512
00:25:19,111 --> 00:25:21,612
Yes, in the sense
that we'll be operating blind.

513
00:25:21,614 --> 00:25:24,147
Yes, because the left kidney
is in the way.

514
00:25:24,228 --> 00:25:27,548
- The healthy left kidney.
- Both kidneys are healthy, Jared.

515
00:25:27,573 --> 00:25:28,619
She only needs one.

516
00:25:28,644 --> 00:25:30,687
Without the left one,
it's theoretically possible

517
00:25:30,689 --> 00:25:32,389
to access the tumor and remove it.

518
00:25:32,391 --> 00:25:34,558
You're suggesting we cut out
a perfectly healthy organ

519
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,064
- just to get a better view?
- Yes.

520
00:25:36,089 --> 00:25:38,947
- But she might die anyway.
- Yes. Quite probably.

521
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:42,933
I have to go. I have a boil to lance.

522
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:48,846
I mean, it's a brilliant...

523
00:25:49,493 --> 00:25:51,494
very, very, very terrible idea.

524
00:25:54,603 --> 00:25:56,503
Close her up and wake her up.

525
00:25:56,615 --> 00:25:57,839
Who wants to join me when I tell her

526
00:25:57,864 --> 00:25:59,416
she has six weeks left to live?

527
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,388
There is one possibility.

528
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:08,458
If we removed the left kidney,

529
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,893
we might be able to get
a good enough view

530
00:26:09,895 --> 00:26:11,555
to successfully remove the mass.

531
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,354
Take out a healthy kidney

532
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:14,798
to get a better view?

533
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,503
That's insane.

534
00:26:16,834 --> 00:26:19,503
A good view's half the battle
in any operation.

535
00:26:20,722 --> 00:26:22,939
Most likely outcome
is we'd be depriving her

536
00:26:22,941 --> 00:26:24,241
of what little time she has left.

537
00:26:24,243 --> 00:26:26,312
But if we succeed...

538
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:28,912
You want to do this
'cause it's exciting.

539
00:26:28,914 --> 00:26:30,280
You want to be a hero.

540
00:26:30,282 --> 00:26:32,850
But if you fail, this woman dies.

541
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:34,251
She misses her son's wedding.

542
00:26:35,953 --> 00:26:37,187
Well, that's the issue, isn't it?

543
00:26:38,491 --> 00:26:40,827
You promised this woman she'll be okay.

544
00:26:49,097 --> 00:26:50,629
She had to do this surgery.

545
00:26:50,654 --> 00:26:52,469
I might as well tell her good things.

546
00:26:52,471 --> 00:26:54,606
The reason we don't make
patients promises

547
00:26:54,631 --> 00:26:55,989
isn't just for legal.

548
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:58,365
Jared's right.
Your judgment is compromised.

549
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:00,077
- I still think...
- You're not objective.

550
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:01,111
Who the hell is?

551
00:27:02,391 --> 00:27:04,758
We should at least wake her up,

552
00:27:04,945 --> 00:27:07,943
explain what we found,
what we're hoping to do,

553
00:27:08,053 --> 00:27:10,520
- and get a new consent.
- What we're hoping to do

554
00:27:10,522 --> 00:27:12,756
is exactly what you told her
we were going to do...

555
00:27:12,813 --> 00:27:14,157
remove that tumor.

556
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,537
The only thing we'd be explaining is

557
00:27:15,562 --> 00:27:16,927
why you undersold the risks.

558
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:20,425
We're doing the surgery.

559
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,707
And, Jared, you're my new number two.

560
00:27:37,139 --> 00:27:39,441
- Mayos.
- Mayos.

561
00:27:42,605 --> 00:27:45,311
I'm going to open the fascia
and expose the kidney.

562
00:27:45,313 --> 00:27:46,813
You clamp the renal hilum.

563
00:27:46,815 --> 00:27:48,546
- Clamp.
- Clamp.

564
00:27:55,223 --> 00:27:56,909
We just cut off the blood supply

565
00:27:56,934 --> 00:27:58,581
to a perfectly healthy kidney.

566
00:27:58,606 --> 00:28:01,284
If we needed color commentary,
I would have hired Jeff Van Gundy.

567
00:28:09,032 --> 00:28:11,633
Shaun, I believe you've met Trevor.

568
00:28:11,807 --> 00:28:13,606
Yes. I sent him home.

569
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:16,284
Yes, well, he didn't go home.

570
00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:17,752
He actually came to

571
00:28:17,777 --> 00:28:20,363
the president of the hospital instead.

572
00:28:20,388 --> 00:28:21,738
H-He said you sent him home

573
00:28:21,763 --> 00:28:22,840
even though you thought he was sick.

574
00:28:22,918 --> 00:28:24,517
I specifically never said that.

575
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:26,152
- I made sure not to say that.
- No. Oh.

576
00:28:26,154 --> 00:28:27,587
What... what the hell does that mean?

577
00:28:27,589 --> 00:28:29,456
- What does that mean, Shaun?
- A-Am I healthy?

578
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:30,824
- Probably.
- You're a doctor.

579
00:28:30,826 --> 00:28:32,530
- You're... you're supposed to know.
- No, we're not...

580
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:34,295
Nobody knows anything for sure.

581
00:28:34,358 --> 00:28:36,756
Anybody could drop dead of
a heart attack at any time.

582
00:28:36,819 --> 00:28:37,998
Who is this guy?

583
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:40,014
Am I... Am I gonna have a heart attack?

584
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:43,219
Shaun has some difficulty

585
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,688
with certain social interactions,
but if he says that...

586
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:46,989
I don't give a crap what he says.

587
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:49,592
W-What do you say? Am I healthy?

588
00:28:50,661 --> 00:28:52,818
I've reviewed your chart,

589
00:28:52,912 --> 00:28:54,623
and I can say with complete confidence

590
00:28:54,648 --> 00:28:56,899
that you are in peak physical condition.

591
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,701
Thank God.

592
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:12,326
Shaun, people need reassurance.

593
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:14,650
I told him he was safe to go home.

594
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:16,919
- I was very clear.
- W-With your words...

595
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,754
Your actions said something
completely different.

596
00:29:18,756 --> 00:29:21,590
No, they didn't.
My actions were completely silent.

597
00:29:22,525 --> 00:29:26,295
When you reassure someone,
they have to receive it.

598
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,830
You have to gauge

599
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:30,498
whether they actually are reassured.

600
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:31,767
You understand?

601
00:29:33,896 --> 00:29:35,805
When did you review Trevor's chart?

602
00:29:36,973 --> 00:29:38,007
I didn't.

603
00:29:39,063 --> 00:29:40,397
It's not really a lie.

604
00:29:40,422 --> 00:29:42,622
If you say that he is safe to go home,

605
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,347
then I know for a fact
that he's safe to go home.

606
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:49,585
I sent a girl home today.

607
00:29:52,022 --> 00:29:54,056
How often do people
develop stomach issues

608
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:55,191
because of their brain?

609
00:29:55,409 --> 00:29:57,620
Based on my personal experience?

610
00:29:57,651 --> 00:29:59,128
Every single day.

611
00:30:01,518 --> 00:30:03,799
I want D-dimer, lactate, and amylase

612
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:05,868
for a 10-year-old girl, Martine LaDuff.

613
00:30:06,034 --> 00:30:08,737
She might have a tummy ache
caused by stress.

614
00:30:08,948 --> 00:30:10,673
Or she might not.

615
00:30:11,341 --> 00:30:12,341
Hi, Shaun.

616
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:13,880
Hi, Carly.

617
00:30:13,905 --> 00:30:16,373
That's a lot of tests
for an upset stomach.

618
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,713
You could get in trouble.

619
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:19,381
That's definitely true.

620
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:24,995
- Remove the kidney.
- All right.

621
00:30:36,316 --> 00:30:37,971
Let's get in there
with some suction, Claire,

622
00:30:37,996 --> 00:30:40,012
so we can get a better view
of what we're dealing with.

623
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:46,475
There it is.

624
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,280
It's a mess.

625
00:30:51,387 --> 00:30:53,332
Yes, it is.

626
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:55,985
But now it's a mess we can see.

627
00:30:56,838 --> 00:30:59,352
Everything is within normal range.

628
00:30:59,962 --> 00:31:01,237
Hmm.

629
00:31:01,344 --> 00:31:03,719
Slightly elevated lactate and amylase,

630
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:05,227
and she's very small.

631
00:31:05,229 --> 00:31:06,729
Normal should be lower.

632
00:31:06,796 --> 00:31:08,898
Normal should be lower.

633
00:31:11,649 --> 00:31:13,608
What do you think she has?

634
00:31:16,456 --> 00:31:17,490
Thank you.

635
00:32:17,147 --> 00:32:19,231
W-What the hell? It... it's after 1:00.

636
00:32:19,256 --> 00:32:20,536
I ran tests.

637
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:22,191
The results were ambiguous.

638
00:32:22,216 --> 00:32:24,363
I think Martine
has intestinal malrotation

639
00:32:24,388 --> 00:32:26,075
and that a volvulus has occurred.

640
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:28,388
Ambiguous tests told you this.

641
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:29,878
It's a genetic condition.

642
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,714
The symptoms are very similar to stress.

643
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:33,482
Call us in the morning.

644
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:34,917
Okay, she may not be alive
in the morning.

645
00:32:39,356 --> 00:32:40,656
Does your boss know you're here?

646
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:45,136
No, I think he'd be upset
with me for being here.

647
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:47,696
I am not waking my daughter up

648
00:32:47,698 --> 00:32:48,797
in the middle of a school night

649
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,065
because of some freak.

650
00:32:50,067 --> 00:32:51,467
And you don't need
to call me in the morning,

651
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,902
because I'll be calling
your boss in the morning.

652
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,188
Were you being sarcastic?

653
00:33:04,213 --> 00:33:06,188
- How hard is it to get rid of someone.
- I told him...

654
00:33:06,213 --> 00:33:08,013
You're right. I'm weird.

655
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:10,407
Part of my weirdness
is that I perseverate.

656
00:33:10,432 --> 00:33:12,532
That means I keep thinking about things.

657
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:16,392
So I will keep knocking on your door
until I know Martine is okay.

658
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,340
Martine.

659
00:33:23,637 --> 00:33:25,070
Martine.

660
00:33:26,244 --> 00:33:27,611
Martine.

661
00:33:27,685 --> 00:33:29,668
Martine, you need to wake up!

662
00:33:31,853 --> 00:33:33,588
- Honey?
- Martine?

663
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:36,545
- She vomited.
- I-I can't wake her!

664
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:39,381
- I'll call 911.
- N-No. There's no time.

665
00:33:39,383 --> 00:33:40,616
- Do you have a car?
- Yeah.

666
00:34:00,504 --> 00:34:02,204
Shaun...

667
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,139
...what's wrong?

668
00:34:04,141 --> 00:34:05,240
What's wrong?

669
00:34:05,242 --> 00:34:07,283
Hey, hey. You called me. What's wrong?

670
00:34:07,308 --> 00:34:08,988
Hey, look at me. Look at me!

671
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:11,019
What's... You don't have to say
the whole thing, okay?

672
00:34:11,044 --> 00:34:12,081
Just one thing, okay?

673
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:13,649
- One thing,
- My... my brother.

674
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:32,004
Hold on, Shaun. Hold on now, hold on.

675
00:34:41,888 --> 00:34:44,363
Her pulse is too weak
to perfuse her organs.

676
00:34:44,388 --> 00:34:46,381
What? What does that...

677
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,285
Jerry!

678
00:34:51,187 --> 00:34:52,327
Please hurry.

679
00:34:59,404 --> 00:35:00,989
Watch your back!

680
00:35:01,014 --> 00:35:02,498
Patient is a 10-year-old female.

681
00:35:02,523 --> 00:35:05,084
She has bradycardia
with hypovolemic shock.

682
00:35:06,352 --> 00:35:08,610
- She needs oxygen, IV adrenaline...
- Go!

683
00:35:08,635 --> 00:35:09,704
...and a liter of saline.

684
00:35:09,729 --> 00:35:11,472
- Wide open, please!
- Coming through!

685
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:15,087
Her pulse is better.
She needs an ultrasound.

686
00:35:21,528 --> 00:35:22,912
That is it.

687
00:35:22,937 --> 00:35:24,437
Wow.

688
00:35:26,576 --> 00:35:27,802
I think you got it all.

689
00:35:27,827 --> 00:35:30,011
- You "think"?
- No. You definitely did.

690
00:35:30,036 --> 00:35:32,245
- I just can't quite believe it.
- It was your idea.

691
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,337
You should have more confidence.

692
00:35:36,854 --> 00:35:38,613
Nice work, Doctor.

693
00:36:00,678 --> 00:36:02,301
There.

694
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:04,270
The small bowel is twisted around

695
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:05,981
the superior mesenteric artery.

696
00:36:05,983 --> 00:36:08,250
Martine needs surgery immediately.

697
00:36:08,645 --> 00:36:10,953
We need to confirm with Dr. Melendez.

698
00:36:10,955 --> 00:36:13,422
N-No. Dr. Melendez is in surgery.

699
00:36:13,424 --> 00:36:14,890
Part of Martine's bowel is dying

700
00:36:14,892 --> 00:36:16,292
- and killing her with it.
- No.

701
00:36:16,294 --> 00:36:18,394
You cannot make these calls on your own.

702
00:36:18,396 --> 00:36:19,862
Dr. Melendez was very clear.

703
00:36:21,531 --> 00:36:22,831
He was very clear.

704
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:24,714
It's past midnight,
which means it's tomorrow,

705
00:36:24,739 --> 00:36:26,502
which means you're no longer my boss.

706
00:36:29,092 --> 00:36:31,564
Is this the O.R. scheduler?

707
00:36:31,746 --> 00:36:33,899
Yes, this is Dr. Murphy.

708
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,025
Prepare an O.R. for surgery.

709
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,386
Ten blade.

710
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:53,323
I'll take it from here.

711
00:36:53,597 --> 00:36:56,031
Nice diagnosis.
I'll handle the repair work.

712
00:36:57,964 --> 00:36:59,528
Is Stephanie okay?

713
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:01,134
Yes.

714
00:37:01,238 --> 00:37:03,465
Jared had an excellent idea,
and she's gonna be fine.

715
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:04,573
- Light.
- Light.

716
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:09,945
Would you like me to assist?

717
00:37:09,947 --> 00:37:11,140
Mm, pretty basic...

718
00:37:11,165 --> 00:37:12,848
I think I can take this one on my own.

719
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,116
Go home. Get some sleep.

720
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,685
Let him stay.

721
00:37:17,665 --> 00:37:19,999
Dr. Andrews, I believe our opinions

722
00:37:20,024 --> 00:37:21,690
on the wisdom of hiring Dr. Murphy...

723
00:37:21,692 --> 00:37:23,515
That battle is lost.

724
00:37:23,655 --> 00:37:25,227
Shaun is here, and we have to accept it,

725
00:37:25,229 --> 00:37:26,962
and we will treat him
like any other resident.

726
00:37:26,987 --> 00:37:29,064
- Sir, it's my team.
- And it's my department.

727
00:37:30,895 --> 00:37:32,563
Dr. Murphy.

728
00:37:36,916 --> 00:37:38,651
Back on suction... congratulations.

729
00:37:48,219 --> 00:37:49,451
Whoo!

730
00:37:49,453 --> 00:37:50,819
I am gonna get a drink.

731
00:37:50,821 --> 00:37:52,688
I'm way too wound up to sleep.

732
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:55,169
You care to join me? For either?

733
00:37:55,194 --> 00:37:56,893
Don't think so.

734
00:37:57,023 --> 00:37:58,656
Seriously?

735
00:37:58,729 --> 00:38:00,529
We were just part of something amazing.

736
00:38:00,531 --> 00:38:02,598
We reached into that woman,
and we healed her.

737
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,085
And you're what?

738
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:06,036
Cranky?

739
00:38:06,203 --> 00:38:08,202
Maybe you could learn something from me.

740
00:38:08,227 --> 00:38:10,282
Like what? To steal credit?

741
00:38:10,307 --> 00:38:12,555
Make yourself a hero with Shaun's idea?

742
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,076
No, but I fought for it.

743
00:38:14,078 --> 00:38:15,744
I went out on a limb for him.

744
00:38:15,746 --> 00:38:17,279
I deserve credit for that.

745
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,426
Why didn't you rat me out
as soon as I brought it up?

746
00:38:21,528 --> 00:38:23,580
- It seemed beside the point.
- No, you didn't rat me out

747
00:38:23,605 --> 00:38:25,364
'cause you thought the idea was crazy.

748
00:38:25,759 --> 00:38:27,845
You were letting me take the fall.

749
00:38:28,092 --> 00:38:29,925
Is that fair?

750
00:38:31,461 --> 00:38:34,730
My idea if it fails,
but Shaun's if it succeeds?

751
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,493
But I'll tell you what...

752
00:38:38,703 --> 00:38:41,108
I'll accept that you're right.

753
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:43,300
I'll apologize to the whole team

754
00:38:43,474 --> 00:38:46,341
if you prove to me
that you're not a hypocrite.

755
00:38:46,343 --> 00:38:48,343
How am I supposed to prove
something like that?

756
00:38:48,569 --> 00:38:51,981
Our patient's about
to come out of anesthesia.

757
00:38:52,081 --> 00:38:53,313
Tell her the truth.

758
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:56,452
When she wakes up and hears what we did,

759
00:38:56,454 --> 00:38:59,106
how we miraculously saved her life,

760
00:38:59,309 --> 00:39:02,078
be honest with her... about credit.

761
00:39:02,326 --> 00:39:04,374
Tell her you didn't want to do it.

762
00:39:04,595 --> 00:39:08,812
Tell her that you wanted
to send her home to die.

763
00:39:16,265 --> 00:39:19,007
I hear you got Shaun off scut

764
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:20,609
and back into surgery.

765
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:23,643
I heard you tried.

766
00:39:23,924 --> 00:39:25,380
You're welcome.

767
00:39:27,378 --> 00:39:29,051
Just a friendly warning...

768
00:39:29,053 --> 00:39:32,120
I know you have no interest
in helping Shaun.

769
00:39:32,122 --> 00:39:33,995
You figure you'll give him
a little authority,

770
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,267
he'll screw something up,

771
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:36,792
and then you'll be done with him,

772
00:39:36,794 --> 00:39:39,061
and then you'll be done with me.

773
00:39:39,363 --> 00:39:41,173
You're right about me.

774
00:39:41,198 --> 00:39:43,191
I am getting old

775
00:39:43,267 --> 00:39:46,201
and maybe a little emotional.

776
00:39:46,504 --> 00:39:49,552
Maybe I over-committed.

777
00:39:50,241 --> 00:39:51,840
But you're wrong about Shaun.

778
00:39:51,927 --> 00:39:55,070
He's gonna handle anything
you throw at him.

779
00:39:56,475 --> 00:39:59,211
Either way, if he succeeds,

780
00:39:59,476 --> 00:40:01,016
I'm the guy who just backed him.

781
00:40:01,018 --> 00:40:04,242
And if he fails, I'm the president.

782
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,640
Everything went great.

783
00:40:24,642 --> 00:40:26,441
Thank you. Thank you.

784
00:40:26,443 --> 00:40:28,544
- Thank you.
- There were complications...

785
00:40:28,546 --> 00:40:31,247
- But I'm okay?
- Yeah, but the surgery...

786
00:40:31,272 --> 00:40:32,581
I don't care.

787
00:40:32,583 --> 00:40:35,150
You saved me. Thank you.

788
00:40:35,152 --> 00:40:36,919
My son's going to be here soon.

789
00:40:36,921 --> 00:40:40,411
I told him you said it would be okay,
but he flew in anyway.

790
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,724
You saved me.

791
00:40:45,962 --> 00:40:48,697
You're gonna be a beautiful
mother of the groom.

792
00:41:13,924 --> 00:41:15,557
Go on and take a bow.

793
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:17,173
You've earned it.

794
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,050
Why does it matter who gets credit?

795
00:41:20,203 --> 00:41:24,254
It matters because
the people who get credit,

796
00:41:24,379 --> 00:41:26,268
they don't have to do scut work.

797
00:41:37,014 --> 00:41:40,471
Dr. Murphy, thank you so much.

798
00:41:43,354 --> 00:41:46,421
Thank you!
