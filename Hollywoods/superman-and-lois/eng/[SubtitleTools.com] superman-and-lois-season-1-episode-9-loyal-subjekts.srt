1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,630
Previously on "Superman & Lois"...

2
00:00:01,635 --> 00:00:03,995
Let's just focus on what
we came here for... family.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,095
You and Jordan basically are weapons.

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,399
I'm the only one in this house
that is completely unarmed.

5
00:00:10,404 --> 00:00:12,554
You don't go snooping around

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,902
some guy from another
world's murder van.

7
00:00:14,907 --> 00:00:19,007
We are the extraordinary humans
in a family of super people.

8
00:00:19,012 --> 00:00:20,013
- Have you seen my dad?
- _

9
00:00:20,017 --> 00:00:22,417
- I can't do the performance without him.
- I can do it.

10
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:24,185
I can't keep getting my hopes up

11
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,848
and then just get disappointed.

12
00:00:25,853 --> 00:00:27,383
Were you able to find enough Subjekts?

13
00:00:27,388 --> 00:00:30,252
Yes, but there's no guarantee
they'll be receptive hosts.

14
00:00:30,257 --> 00:00:31,620
That was a nasty sight.

15
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:34,657
The gas was an experimental
synthetic Kryptonite

16
00:00:34,662 --> 00:00:36,892
designed to invade
your respiratory system,

17
00:00:36,897 --> 00:00:38,631
weaken you from the inside.

18
00:00:56,977 --> 00:00:59,374
Why is Edge here?

19
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:03,111
I mean, why Smallville?

20
00:01:03,116 --> 00:01:05,180
Definitely not for the biryani.

21
00:01:05,185 --> 00:01:08,817
He was in and out of Hazel
Green and Granville in weeks,

22
00:01:08,822 --> 00:01:11,353
he shut down operations in
New Carthage in a few months,

23
00:01:11,358 --> 00:01:12,621
and now he's here.

24
00:01:12,626 --> 00:01:15,290
Gotta be for the same reason
as the other towns, right?

25
00:01:15,295 --> 00:01:16,825
Mine for X-Kryptonite,

26
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,194
use that machine I saw
that gives people powers.

27
00:01:19,199 --> 00:01:20,796
Yeah, I know that's part of it,

28
00:01:20,801 --> 00:01:23,865
but Smallville's the only town
where he's sticking around,

29
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:27,069
so there has to be a reason
why Smallville is different.

30
00:01:27,074 --> 00:01:28,937
He needs this place.

31
00:01:28,942 --> 00:01:32,307
This is your specialty.

32
00:01:32,312 --> 00:01:35,077
How do you suggest we figure out why?

33
00:01:35,082 --> 00:01:36,645
We dig deeper.

34
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,648
We need to use every resource
at our disposal.

35
00:01:39,653 --> 00:01:42,650
So as we know, he was only
in Hazel Green...

36
00:01:42,655 --> 00:01:44,086
Clark's a great reporter.

37
00:01:44,091 --> 00:01:47,522
Now that he's not coaching, he can help.

38
00:01:47,527 --> 00:01:51,426
We get all the information
we can from Lana,

39
00:01:51,431 --> 00:01:54,936
files on everyone Edge has recruited,

40
00:01:55,869 --> 00:01:59,167
who they are, where they come from.

41
00:01:59,172 --> 00:02:00,269
Thank you.

42
00:02:00,274 --> 00:02:02,971
Pore over every single detail.

43
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:05,574
There's Emily.

44
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,009
And then we start back at the beginning.

45
00:02:08,014 --> 00:02:10,679
All right, so we know
Emily is the newest recruit.

46
00:02:10,684 --> 00:02:14,889
Connect every dot,
piece it all together,

47
00:02:15,855 --> 00:02:18,386
and if we've done our job right,

48
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:21,423
the answer will present itself.

49
00:02:21,428 --> 00:02:23,525
My goal has always been the same.

50
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,161
I want to change this world,

51
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:29,964
and I finally found the place
where I can start doing so...

52
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:33,769
here in Smallville with people like you.

53
00:02:33,774 --> 00:02:35,804
Me?

54
00:02:35,809 --> 00:02:37,172
Why?

55
00:02:37,177 --> 00:02:40,642
I know your life hasn't been
easy the past few years.

56
00:02:40,647 --> 00:02:43,011
I know the pain you're in.

57
00:02:45,185 --> 00:02:47,115
The fear,

58
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,417
knowing you can't provide
for your family,

59
00:02:49,422 --> 00:02:52,927
that burden, that stress.

60
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:56,525
With my assistance,
all those fears can go away.

61
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,662
I can improve your life
in every way imaginable.

62
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:03,565
I can improve you, Emily.

63
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,100
Will this hurt?

64
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,978
Not a bit.

65
00:03:15,076 --> 00:03:19,481
If you'd like me to,
I can activate a new life.

66
00:03:19,486 --> 00:03:21,650
A new life?

67
00:03:21,655 --> 00:03:23,855
Process you'd go through
will make you feel

68
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,557
like a new person,

69
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:29,224
clear-minded, stronger,

70
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:32,828
capable of things
you never dreamt possible.

71
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:36,765
But I can only do that
if you're willing,

72
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:40,275
if you acknowledge
that the life you have now

73
00:03:41,074 --> 00:03:42,771
is not what you want anymore.

74
00:03:42,776 --> 00:03:45,545
Complete host acceptance.

75
00:03:46,077 --> 00:03:48,077
_

76
00:03:48,082 --> 00:03:49,712
Process isn't complete.

77
00:03:49,717 --> 00:03:52,348
It'll take a few days
before you're fully in control,

78
00:03:52,353 --> 00:03:54,520
but once that happens...

79
00:03:57,657 --> 00:04:01,122
Life will be yours again.

80
00:04:01,127 --> 00:04:05,932
Do you want to become
your best self, Emily?

81
00:04:07,267 --> 00:04:08,463
I do.

82
00:04:12,678 --> 00:04:15,678
- Synced and corrected by Firefly -
- www.addic7ed.com -

83
00:04:17,677 --> 00:04:20,775
Lana said Edge asked her
to find more candidates,

84
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,844
so until we can figure out
how to stop him,

85
00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:25,247
we need to convince people to stay away.

86
00:04:25,252 --> 00:04:28,116
Lois, he's offering people
jobs and money,

87
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:30,785
things they need to feel in
control of their lives again.

88
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,654
Boys, bus'll be here in a minute!

89
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:34,156
Clark, we have to do something,

90
00:04:34,161 --> 00:04:35,362
and nobody's gonna listen to me.

91
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:36,898
They haven't since that first town hall,

92
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:37,998
but they will to you.

93
00:04:38,003 --> 00:04:40,262
- Hey, which one's mine?
- Here.

94
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:41,463
Thanks.

95
00:04:41,468 --> 00:04:42,869
All right, guys,
we're probably gonna have

96
00:04:42,873 --> 00:04:44,900
another late night working
on this Edge case.

97
00:04:44,905 --> 00:04:46,385
All right, we were gonna see

98
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,504
Sarah's revue tonight anyway.

99
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:52,107
You guys sure are spending
quite a bit of time together

100
00:04:52,112 --> 00:04:54,009
for just being "friends".

101
00:04:54,014 --> 00:04:56,111
Just trying to support her, Dad.

102
00:04:56,116 --> 00:04:58,113
- Uh-huh.
- Right.

103
00:04:59,486 --> 00:05:00,582
What?

104
00:05:00,587 --> 00:05:02,450
She said she just wanted to be friends.

105
00:05:02,455 --> 00:05:04,853
Might be more than that,
but I will leave it up to her

106
00:05:04,858 --> 00:05:07,656
to tell you.

107
00:05:07,661 --> 00:05:09,791
Bus is pulling up.

108
00:05:09,796 --> 00:05:11,627
All right, there's leftovers
in the fridge, okay?

109
00:05:11,631 --> 00:05:13,128
All right, love you guys. Bye.

110
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:15,830
All right, I gotta go meet
Lana at the Gazette.

111
00:05:15,835 --> 00:05:18,767
Clark, you are Martha Kent's son.

112
00:05:18,772 --> 00:05:21,636
She was helping people here
way before Edge showed up.

113
00:05:21,641 --> 00:05:24,005
They will listen to you.

114
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,473
All right.

115
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:27,446
- Bye.
- Bye.

116
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:32,847
And none of these people are
acting differently at all?

117
00:05:32,852 --> 00:05:36,952
I mean, the only change I see
is how happy they are.

118
00:05:36,957 --> 00:05:39,821
Like, they're truly excited to be there,

119
00:05:39,826 --> 00:05:42,891
to be a part of something,
to change their lives.

120
00:05:42,896 --> 00:05:44,726
What is he doing with them?

121
00:05:44,731 --> 00:05:47,395
Personal development, self-improvement,

122
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,130
trust exercises.

123
00:05:49,135 --> 00:05:51,499
I really don't know the specifics.

124
00:05:51,504 --> 00:05:53,068
Well, it sounds like a cult,

125
00:05:53,073 --> 00:05:56,070
only Edge is power-brainwashing
free of charge.

126
00:05:56,075 --> 00:05:58,339
The only other thing I can tell you

127
00:05:58,344 --> 00:06:01,843
is they started these morning
"togethers" at Victoria May's.

128
00:06:01,848 --> 00:06:03,578
- Togethers?
- Mm-hmm.

129
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:07,549
Camaraderie-building breakfasts.

130
00:06:07,554 --> 00:06:09,150
Oh, I'm gonna be late.

131
00:06:09,155 --> 00:06:11,720
Wait... Lana, maybe
you should take a break.

132
00:06:11,725 --> 00:06:13,922
This is kinda starting
to get really dangerous,

133
00:06:13,926 --> 00:06:15,491
and I don't want anything
to happen to you.

134
00:06:15,495 --> 00:06:17,559
It's okay, Lois, really.

135
00:06:17,564 --> 00:06:21,763
I mean, if I can keep Edge
from hurting just one person,

136
00:06:21,768 --> 00:06:23,736
it's worth it.

137
00:06:25,739 --> 00:06:27,302
Think I should head over to the diner,

138
00:06:27,307 --> 00:06:29,671
go full intervention on this breakfast.

139
00:06:29,676 --> 00:06:32,006
No, you stay focused
on getting what you can

140
00:06:32,011 --> 00:06:33,011
on Edge's minions.

141
00:06:33,016 --> 00:06:37,049
I know someone who might have
a better shot at getting through.

142
00:06:45,658 --> 00:06:47,555
Okay.

143
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,391
Hey, boys!

144
00:06:49,396 --> 00:06:51,760
Hey, come on over.

145
00:06:51,765 --> 00:06:53,728
- Hey, Mr. Cushing.
- Hi.

146
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:55,964
Jordan, listen, I...

147
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:57,966
I just want to say thank you
for stepping up

148
00:06:57,971 --> 00:06:59,902
and helping Sarah with
her audition the other day.

149
00:06:59,906 --> 00:07:02,704
That really saved the day, man.

150
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:04,639
Yeah, uh, thanks.

151
00:07:04,644 --> 00:07:06,574
Okay, you don't want to be late.

152
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:08,676
Yeah.

153
00:07:08,681 --> 00:07:11,012
Hey, we'll see you later, okay?

154
00:07:11,017 --> 00:07:12,280
Yeah.

155
00:07:12,285 --> 00:07:14,649
Can't wait to see you up there tonight!

156
00:07:14,654 --> 00:07:15,784
Don't ask.

157
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:18,253
He's having some kind
of personality crisis.

158
00:07:18,258 --> 00:07:19,321
Really?

159
00:07:19,326 --> 00:07:21,557
Yeah, he keeps telling me
how he's changed for good

160
00:07:21,561 --> 00:07:23,258
and how he feels better.

161
00:07:23,263 --> 00:07:25,494
Things improve for a little bit,
it's the same crap as always,

162
00:07:25,498 --> 00:07:28,963
and then he crashes like
your brother's about to.

163
00:07:28,968 --> 00:07:30,031
What?

164
00:07:30,036 --> 00:07:31,933
I told you, stay away
from Tegan Wickhem.

165
00:07:31,938 --> 00:07:34,669
Just trust me, okay?

166
00:07:53,193 --> 00:07:54,789
Clark?

167
00:07:54,794 --> 00:07:56,024
Emily, hi.

168
00:07:56,029 --> 00:07:57,659
I heard you were back in town.

169
00:07:57,664 --> 00:07:59,494
Yeah, I'm sorry I haven't seen you.

170
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:01,463
It's been crazy since we moved here.

171
00:08:01,468 --> 00:08:03,708
I bet... me, too, actually,

172
00:08:03,715 --> 00:08:05,635
- but for the better.
- Oh, yeah?

173
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,204
I heard you were working
at Edge EnerCorp.

174
00:08:08,308 --> 00:08:11,473
It has changed my life.

175
00:08:13,313 --> 00:08:14,876
I feel great.

176
00:08:14,881 --> 00:08:17,412
I can think better, focus, you know,

177
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:20,648
problems that seemed impossible
before are like nothing now.

178
00:08:20,653 --> 00:08:22,217
Really? Wow, you know what?

179
00:08:22,222 --> 00:08:24,119
Actually, I would love to talk
to you about that.

180
00:08:24,123 --> 00:08:25,653
Like, you're looking for work?

181
00:08:25,658 --> 00:08:27,722
- Uh, well...
- Oh, it's okay.

182
00:08:27,727 --> 00:08:29,157
Just talk to Lana.

183
00:08:29,162 --> 00:08:31,559
She hooked me up,
got me into the program.

184
00:08:31,564 --> 00:08:34,863
I'm sure she'd be happy
to help her old boyfriend.

185
00:08:34,868 --> 00:08:37,565
- Yeah.
- Oh, I gotta go.

186
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,100
Let me know if I can be of help.

187
00:08:39,105 --> 00:08:40,935
It was so good to see you, Clark.

188
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,075
- You, too.
- Take care.

189
00:08:52,252 --> 00:08:55,650
_

190
00:10:38,075 --> 00:10:39,476
_

191
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:43,481
_

192
00:10:52,356 --> 00:10:53,920
Thank God you're back.

193
00:10:53,925 --> 00:10:56,589
Edge just sent someone over
with a massive ad buy

194
00:10:56,594 --> 00:10:58,424
for tomorrow's paper.

195
00:10:58,429 --> 00:11:01,227
- For more recruits?
- Twice as many.

196
00:11:01,232 --> 00:11:04,497
Whatever crazy voodoo
Edge is doing to those people,

197
00:11:04,502 --> 00:11:06,299
he's kicking it into high gear.

198
00:11:06,304 --> 00:11:08,901
Where are you going?

199
00:11:08,906 --> 00:11:11,204
Oh, to make a scene.

200
00:11:16,647 --> 00:11:17,910
- Lois.
- Where's Edge?

201
00:11:17,915 --> 00:11:19,078
He's in a group meeting.

202
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,881
I just found out about
the ad this morning.

203
00:11:24,755 --> 00:11:26,954
You don't want anything
to do with what he's offering.

204
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,487
Ms. Lane...

205
00:11:28,492 --> 00:11:30,156
You all need to walk away right now.

206
00:11:30,161 --> 00:11:32,425
Walk away.

207
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,160
Don't touch me.

208
00:11:34,165 --> 00:11:36,826
I'm sorry, if everyone could
give Ms. Lane and I a moment.

209
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,461
I promise this won't take long.

210
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,697
I know this sounds insane because it is,

211
00:11:40,702 --> 00:11:43,302
but he wants to erase everything you are

212
00:11:43,307 --> 00:11:45,975
and replace it with something else.

213
00:11:50,148 --> 00:11:51,644
Well, that was desperate.

214
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:53,746
I know what you're doing.

215
00:11:53,751 --> 00:11:56,415
Providing good jobs
to a community in need.

216
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,084
You are putting
Kryptonian consciousnesses

217
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:00,253
into people's bodies.

218
00:12:00,258 --> 00:12:03,789
You are taking them over
and giving them powers.

219
00:12:03,794 --> 00:12:06,392
And your evidence for this is...

220
00:12:06,397 --> 00:12:09,262
Derek Powell, Reno Rosetti, Leslie.

221
00:12:09,267 --> 00:12:12,331
Oh, so two dead men
and my personal assistant.

222
00:12:12,436 --> 00:12:16,335
I have to say, this story has
holes even by your standards.

223
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,471
We both know it's the truth.

224
00:12:18,575 --> 00:12:21,439
In my experience,
truth is rather subjective.

225
00:12:21,444 --> 00:12:23,210
Who do you think people are
more likely to believe?

226
00:12:23,214 --> 00:12:26,544
A has-been slumming it
at the local paper

227
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:27,814
or the man who's giving this town

228
00:12:27,818 --> 00:12:29,482
the best economy it's ever known?

229
00:12:29,487 --> 00:12:33,118
These people are not puppets
to be controlled by you.

230
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,165
They have dreams. They have families.

231
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,734
No one's being forced to do
anything against their will.

232
00:12:38,739 --> 00:12:41,604
Everyone's made the same offer:
the chance for a better life.

233
00:12:41,609 --> 00:12:44,373
- Says so right there.
- We're not publishing this.

234
00:12:44,378 --> 00:12:48,177
Then I guess word of mouth
will have to suffice.

235
00:12:48,182 --> 00:12:51,714
You can't stop this, Lois.

236
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:53,716
Perhaps it's time you use
that device you have

237
00:12:53,721 --> 00:12:56,285
to call in your super friend.

238
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:59,922
Perhaps it is.

239
00:12:59,927 --> 00:13:01,591
Risky, though.

240
00:13:01,596 --> 00:13:03,860
Need I remind you where he's from?

241
00:13:03,865 --> 00:13:05,895
He may take comfort knowing
there are others here

242
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,464
just like him,

243
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:11,400
as John Irons prophesied.

244
00:13:11,405 --> 00:13:14,337
Superman is nothing like them.

245
00:13:16,477 --> 00:13:18,574
I'm excited to find out.

246
00:13:27,355 --> 00:13:29,485
Hey, looks like you finally
figured out that locker.

247
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,554
Yeah, no, yeah, I took your advice.

248
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:34,423
You know, nothing good
ever comes from anger, so...

249
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:42,131
Hey, Tegan.

250
00:13:42,136 --> 00:13:46,441
Hey, um, I was just wondering
if, like, maybe you wanted

251
00:13:46,446 --> 00:13:50,379
to, like, hang out
after school sometime?

252
00:13:50,384 --> 00:13:52,147
Hang out?

253
00:13:52,152 --> 00:13:55,210
- Like, just the two of us?
- Yeah, I mean,

254
00:13:55,215 --> 00:13:58,614
it doesn't have to be, like,
that formal or anything, just,

255
00:13:58,619 --> 00:14:01,250
I don't know, grab a bite
at the diner, or...

256
00:14:01,255 --> 00:14:04,186
Um...

257
00:14:04,191 --> 00:14:07,256
Look, I'm sure you're
a really sweet guy and all...

258
00:14:07,261 --> 00:14:09,492
Look, I just... I thought...

259
00:14:09,497 --> 00:14:12,328
I don't know, I just thought,
like, we were trading looks.

260
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:16,098
Well, yeah, I mean,
you had that broken arm,

261
00:14:16,103 --> 00:14:17,367
and you looked so lonely.

262
00:14:17,372 --> 00:14:20,436
I was just trying to be nice.

263
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:21,971
Yeah, right.

264
00:14:21,976 --> 00:14:24,141
Look, I wasn't trying to hurt
your feelings or anything...

265
00:14:24,145 --> 00:14:26,676
No, no, no, no, no, no, it's, uh...

266
00:14:26,681 --> 00:14:27,681
it's all good.

267
00:14:27,686 --> 00:14:29,917
It's my bad.

268
00:14:29,922 --> 00:14:32,519
- Cool.
- See ya later.

269
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,991
Whew, looks like you need
a new playbook, QB number two.

270
00:14:37,996 --> 00:14:39,896
You gotta work on closing that deal

271
00:14:39,901 --> 00:14:42,332
like you close your locker.

272
00:14:46,547 --> 00:14:48,944
- Clark, are you here?
- In the kitchen.

273
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:50,446
We got a problem.

274
00:14:50,451 --> 00:14:53,349
Morgan Edge is ramping up
that program of his.

275
00:14:53,354 --> 00:14:55,818
Oh, my God, what happened?

276
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,341
I went to stop this bank
robbery, and I got hit.

277
00:14:58,346 --> 00:15:01,144
- Did they use Kryptonite?
- No, regular bullets.

278
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:02,178
This isn't normal.

279
00:15:02,183 --> 00:15:05,281
Superman doesn't bruise,
especially not from bullets.

280
00:15:05,286 --> 00:15:07,087
Do you think it has something
to do with that gas

281
00:15:07,091 --> 00:15:08,388
Rosetti used?

282
00:15:08,393 --> 00:15:09,393
I don't know.

283
00:15:09,398 --> 00:15:11,028
We're gonna have to call my dad.

284
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,561
Sorry about messing up the intro.

285
00:15:18,566 --> 00:15:22,565
I didn't even notice. You sounded great.

286
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,267
Thanks.

287
00:15:25,372 --> 00:15:27,269
How are you so awesome at piano?

288
00:15:27,274 --> 00:15:28,704
Do you have any other little

289
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:30,010
secret talents you're
not telling me about?

290
00:15:30,014 --> 00:15:31,810
Um...

291
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:35,010
nah, this is pretty much it.

292
00:15:35,015 --> 00:15:38,014
Well, thank you for everything,

293
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:40,916
all the time you've put into this.

294
00:15:40,921 --> 00:15:43,523
It really means a lot
having you here, so...

295
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,556
I want to be here.

296
00:15:55,803 --> 00:15:57,867
Bless you.

297
00:16:00,107 --> 00:16:04,312
I, um... I must have allergies
or something.

298
00:16:04,317 --> 00:16:07,281
Jordan, I...

299
00:16:07,286 --> 00:16:09,283
Jordan!

300
00:16:24,565 --> 00:16:26,796
Jordan.

301
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:30,166
Something's wrong with me.

302
00:16:32,706 --> 00:16:34,970
You're infected, too.

303
00:16:34,975 --> 00:16:36,539
Come on.

304
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,600
- Here, honey.
- So what's happening?

305
00:16:41,605 --> 00:16:44,302
The Kryptonite gas that
Rosetti used on me at the DOD,

306
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:47,205
it was a bio-weapon, and I think
it might be communicable.

307
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:50,809
Like, a virus?

308
00:16:50,814 --> 00:16:55,619
So I'm getting Kryptonite
sickness from you?

309
00:16:56,419 --> 00:16:58,383
Yeah.

310
00:16:58,388 --> 00:17:00,051
Clark, it's not your fault.

311
00:17:00,056 --> 00:17:02,420
You didn't even know anything
was happening until today.

312
00:17:02,425 --> 00:17:05,590
You have super-healing,
so how long are you sick for?

313
00:17:05,595 --> 00:17:09,131
Your dad has never been sick
a day in his life.

314
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,270
Well, I'm not that bad.

315
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,771
Ow.

316
00:17:19,776 --> 00:17:21,840
This wasn't supposed to happen.

317
00:17:21,845 --> 00:17:23,208
Really?

318
00:17:23,213 --> 00:17:27,011
Because it sure seems like a weapon
designed to hurt Superman

319
00:17:27,016 --> 00:17:28,780
would hurt Superman.

320
00:17:28,785 --> 00:17:31,015
It was only meant as a last resort,

321
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,351
just to weaken him temporarily.

322
00:17:33,356 --> 00:17:36,788
Then why is my son sick?
Explain that to me.

323
00:17:36,793 --> 00:17:39,724
You put your own grandson in harm's way.

324
00:17:39,729 --> 00:17:42,360
Sam, how do we fix this?

325
00:17:42,365 --> 00:17:44,562
My guys are working on it.

326
00:17:46,636 --> 00:17:49,033
- Yo, Sarah.
- Hi.

327
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:50,936
Hey, are there gonna
be, like, refreshments

328
00:17:50,941 --> 00:17:52,771
at this thing, or what?

329
00:17:52,776 --> 00:17:54,205
Have you seen Jordan?

330
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,575
No, he's probably
just, like, putting on

331
00:17:55,579 --> 00:17:56,810
his best black tee for the show.

332
00:17:56,814 --> 00:17:58,165
- You know how it goes.
- No, I don't,

333
00:17:58,169 --> 00:18:01,233
because he left about an hour ago,
and he hasn't come back.

334
00:18:01,238 --> 00:18:02,718
Did he tell you where he was going?

335
00:18:02,723 --> 00:18:04,119
No, he just ran out of rehearsal

336
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,522
like a frightened little rabbit, I...

337
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,821
We were really having
a nice time together,

338
00:18:09,826 --> 00:18:12,323
or at least I thought we were
until he completely ghosted me.

339
00:18:12,328 --> 00:18:14,058
Sarah, I don't think it's about you.

340
00:18:14,063 --> 00:18:15,593
I'll find him.

341
00:18:15,598 --> 00:18:18,863
Okay, well, hurry up because
I think I'm the first one up.

342
00:18:18,868 --> 00:18:20,832
All right.

343
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:24,335
Emily.

344
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,870
Emily, hey.

345
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,906
I've been meaning to ask you,

346
00:18:27,911 --> 00:18:30,742
how's it going with the program?

347
00:18:30,747 --> 00:18:33,812
Mr. Edge is a genius.

348
00:18:33,817 --> 00:18:36,047
You know, that he somehow
figured out a process

349
00:18:36,052 --> 00:18:38,083
to completely transform people's lives,

350
00:18:38,088 --> 00:18:40,218
it's amazing.

351
00:18:40,223 --> 00:18:41,820
What process?

352
00:18:43,426 --> 00:18:46,925
I'm sorry, I assumed you'd
already gone through it.

353
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,793
No, I haven't.

354
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:51,830
What did he do to you exactly?

355
00:18:51,835 --> 00:18:54,799
Mr. Edge was very clear
we not tell anyone.

356
00:18:54,804 --> 00:18:58,203
Emily, we've known each other
since the fifth grade.

357
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,804
You can trust me.

358
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:02,440
Lana, do you have a moment?

359
00:19:04,347 --> 00:19:06,611
I'll see you later.

360
00:19:18,061 --> 00:19:20,191
It seems

361
00:19:20,196 --> 00:19:23,532
you've been looking into things
that don't concern you.

362
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:28,466
You put me in charge of the
Young Executive Program.

363
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:31,169
I should at least know
what it's really about.

364
00:19:31,174 --> 00:19:34,639
And is this to satisfy
your own curiosity

365
00:19:34,644 --> 00:19:37,075
or so that you can run
and tell Lois Lane?

366
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,245
- I never told her anything.
- It's okay.

367
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,380
As evidenced by today's spectacle,

368
00:19:42,385 --> 00:19:43,615
Miss Lane is desperate.

369
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,116
In fact, I'd have been more surprised

370
00:19:45,121 --> 00:19:48,286
if she hadn't tried
to scare you into helping.

371
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:54,264
Emily told me about a process
she went under.

372
00:19:55,498 --> 00:19:58,463
What is she talking about?

373
00:19:58,468 --> 00:20:00,798
An offer I made her,

374
00:20:00,803 --> 00:20:05,008
the same one I'm about
to make right now to you,

375
00:20:06,209 --> 00:20:09,507
and make no mistake.

376
00:20:09,512 --> 00:20:13,411
The answer you give will
impact the rest of your life.

377
00:20:17,153 --> 00:20:20,055
- Jordan, where are you?
- Upstairs.

378
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:24,455
Wow, it's like Iditarod-level
cold in here.

379
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,190
Your brother's sick.

380
00:20:26,195 --> 00:20:29,594
Does that have something to
do with you flaking on Sarah?

381
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:32,597
- I gotta get back there, I...
- You're not going anywhere.

382
00:20:32,602 --> 00:20:35,266
Sarah's going on any minute,
and I can't just abandon her.

383
00:20:35,271 --> 00:20:37,101
- She'll be okay.
- No, she won't.

384
00:20:37,106 --> 00:20:38,836
This is exactly what her dad did.

385
00:20:38,841 --> 00:20:40,138
I can't let that happen again.

386
00:20:40,143 --> 00:20:41,773
I know you want to be there for her,

387
00:20:41,778 --> 00:20:43,107
but you cannot go anywhere

388
00:20:43,112 --> 00:20:44,544
until we know exactly what is going on.

389
00:20:44,548 --> 00:20:46,324
Wait, w... wait, we don't even
know what's going on with him?

390
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,893
The Kryptonite that
infected your brother

391
00:20:47,897 --> 00:20:49,348
is affecting him differently than me.

392
00:20:49,352 --> 00:20:51,115
Your grandfather's working
with the doctors

393
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,318
to figure out a way to help him.

394
00:20:52,322 --> 00:20:54,018
Jonathan, he's gonna be fine.

395
00:20:57,494 --> 00:21:00,992
Dad, that does not seem fine.

396
00:21:00,997 --> 00:21:03,027
It's getting harder to breathe.

397
00:21:03,032 --> 00:21:06,598
- What is happening to him?
- We can't wait for your dad.

398
00:21:14,944 --> 00:21:17,212
Let me call you back.

399
00:21:19,382 --> 00:21:22,280
Why's Clark leaving?

400
00:21:22,285 --> 00:21:23,915
To do what you can't.

401
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,685
Lois, that gas Rosetti used
on Clark was synthetic,

402
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,821
experimental, hadn't been tested.

403
00:21:29,826 --> 00:21:32,694
We didn't know what
his reaction would be.

404
00:21:36,199 --> 00:21:40,404
All my life, your job was
your number one priority.

405
00:21:41,137 --> 00:21:43,968
Accepting that wasn't easy,

406
00:21:43,973 --> 00:21:46,704
but I learned to live with it,
and somehow even grew

407
00:21:46,709 --> 00:21:49,307
to respect it because I
believed that you were trying

408
00:21:49,312 --> 00:21:52,143
to do the right thing,
and I honestly naively thought

409
00:21:52,248 --> 00:21:55,713
that once I had a family,
you might change,

410
00:21:55,718 --> 00:21:58,716
start putting us first,

411
00:21:58,721 --> 00:22:01,486
but I was wrong.

412
00:22:01,491 --> 00:22:06,396
Knowingly and willingly
endangering the lives

413
00:22:06,401 --> 00:22:09,366
of the people I love...

414
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:11,902
I can't forgive that.

415
00:22:12,068 --> 00:22:14,332
So when this is over,
I want you to leave

416
00:22:14,337 --> 00:22:16,534
and never come back.

417
00:22:19,308 --> 00:22:22,473
You're not welcome here anymore.

418
00:22:41,145 --> 00:22:42,743
Jordan's been infected with Kryptonite.

419
00:22:42,747 --> 00:22:44,043
It's affecting his breathing.

420
00:22:44,048 --> 00:22:46,612
He's in respiratory distress.

421
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:47,747
Why?

422
00:22:47,752 --> 00:22:51,283
The Kryptonite is causing
his lungs to fill with fluid.

423
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:54,453
As he can condense
large quantities of air...

424
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:56,956
He's cooling it, like I do.

425
00:22:56,961 --> 00:22:58,591
Can you get the Kryptonite out of him?

426
00:22:58,596 --> 00:23:01,994
Likely, but only the same way we have

427
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:04,230
with you in the past.

428
00:23:10,908 --> 00:23:13,306
- What?
- Come here.

429
00:23:13,311 --> 00:23:14,874
Come here.

430
00:23:16,714 --> 00:23:19,412
We're gonna have to burn the
Kryptonite out of your system.

431
00:23:19,417 --> 00:23:22,248
Burn it how?

432
00:23:22,253 --> 00:23:26,018
With heat, with some immense heat.

433
00:23:26,023 --> 00:23:27,953
- No, no...
- Listen to me, listen to me.

434
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:30,089
Listen to me. This is
the only way, okay?

435
00:23:30,094 --> 00:23:31,257
We have to do this,

436
00:23:31,262 --> 00:23:33,026
otherwise your lungs
could completely freeze.

437
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:35,861
- Dad, I'm scared.
- I'm gonna be right here.

438
00:23:35,866 --> 00:23:38,030
You're gonna take my hand, okay?

439
00:23:38,035 --> 00:23:41,701
You're gonna squeeze as hard
as you need to, okay?

440
00:23:41,706 --> 00:23:43,636
You can do this.

441
00:23:53,217 --> 00:23:55,185
Mom.

442
00:23:57,021 --> 00:23:59,752
Mom, you okay?

443
00:23:59,757 --> 00:24:02,388
I should've protected him.

444
00:24:04,328 --> 00:24:06,859
Mom, this isn't... this isn't on you.

445
00:24:10,434 --> 00:24:11,797
I'm your mom.

446
00:24:11,802 --> 00:24:14,366
My one job is to keep you guys safe,

447
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:16,101
and I keep failing at it.

448
00:24:16,106 --> 00:24:17,903
No, no, you don't.

449
00:24:17,908 --> 00:24:21,596
You were almost gunned down
in John Henry's RV...

450
00:24:21,601 --> 00:24:24,076
- That was my fault.
- Got into a car accident.

451
00:24:24,081 --> 00:24:25,378
That was also my fault.

452
00:24:25,383 --> 00:24:27,346
I feel like I can't turn around

453
00:24:27,351 --> 00:24:29,248
without one of you
being in mortal danger.

454
00:24:29,253 --> 00:24:32,255
Why is it so hard to keep you safe?

455
00:24:34,091 --> 00:24:36,222
I don't know.

456
00:24:36,227 --> 00:24:38,391
Just...

457
00:24:38,396 --> 00:24:42,301
Just part of being
a super family, I guess.

458
00:24:46,337 --> 00:24:48,801
Hey, come here.

459
00:24:48,806 --> 00:24:51,404
Dad'll figure something out.

460
00:24:51,409 --> 00:24:53,572
He always does.

461
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,249
- Hey, Lana.
- Hey.

462
00:25:03,254 --> 00:25:05,751
- I saved you both seats.
- Oh, thank you.

463
00:25:05,756 --> 00:25:07,920
- Hi, how are you doing?
- Hey.

464
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:09,588
Good to see you.

465
00:25:13,964 --> 00:25:16,662
Hello, everyone,
and thank you for coming.

466
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:17,963
Our students tonight...

467
00:25:17,968 --> 00:25:19,865
How did everything go with Edge?

468
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:23,369
Oh, amazing. He explained
everything to me.

469
00:25:23,374 --> 00:25:25,337
It all makes perfect sense.

470
00:25:25,342 --> 00:25:27,239
- All right.
- Yeah, thank you.

471
00:25:27,244 --> 00:25:29,308
- And for our first performance,
- _

472
00:25:29,313 --> 00:25:31,911
we have the very talented Sarah Cushing

473
00:25:31,916 --> 00:25:34,647
singing "Little Light" by Amos Lee.

474
00:25:34,752 --> 00:25:36,882
Whoo!

475
00:25:53,337 --> 00:25:54,900
Um...

476
00:25:54,905 --> 00:25:57,136
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

477
00:25:57,141 --> 00:26:00,105
Yes, you can.

478
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:02,475

Then we'll get everything
straightened out

00:27:24,748 --> 00:27:26,258
with Jordan and your dad.

490
00:27:26,263 --> 00:27:28,364
Little late for that, isn't it?

491
00:27:30,834 --> 00:27:33,002
Why'd you do it?

492
00:27:34,505 --> 00:27:37,674
Why'd you build those weapons
to hurt my dad?

493
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,645
Your father's the most powerful being

this world's ever known.

495
00:27:49,386 --> 00:27:52,318
My job is to keep us safe,

496
00:27:52,323 --> 00:27:55,421
which means being prepared
for any scenario,

497
00:27:55,426 --> 00:27:58,958
no matter how unlikely.

498
00:27:58,963 --> 00:28:01,260
You and I, we're not like your dad,

499
00:28:01,265 --> 00:28:03,429
or even Jordan.

500
00:28:03,434 --> 00:28:05,230
He's my twin brother.

501
00:28:05,235 --> 00:28:09,040
Yes, but the minute his powers surfaced,

502
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:13,509
you and him began walking
two very different paths.

503
00:28:15,446 --> 00:28:17,743
That scares you, doesn't it?

504
00:28:17,748 --> 00:28:20,483
It does.

505
00:28:21,986 --> 00:28:23,882
You know, I think you're wrong.

506
00:28:23,887 --> 00:28:27,586
I think you're wrong about
you and I being alike.

507
00:28:27,591 --> 00:28:29,521
How so?

508
00:28:31,295 --> 00:28:35,361
I could never be scared of my family,

509
00:28:35,466 --> 00:28:37,429
no matter what powers they might have.

510
00:28:37,434 --> 00:28:40,899
Jonathan, you haven't
seen the things I have.

511
00:28:42,906 --> 00:28:45,037
Yeah, you're right.

512
00:28:47,578 --> 00:28:49,642
But in the end,

513
00:28:49,647 --> 00:28:52,511
I don't think that would matter

514
00:28:52,516 --> 00:28:55,080
'cause I'd still trust them,

515
00:28:55,085 --> 00:28:57,750

00:30:03,821 --> 00:30:07,019
Have you seen this?

531
00:30:08,926 --> 00:30:10,489
He's still weak.

532
00:30:10,494 --> 00:30:14,460
The exact reason why I just
activated some of our Subjekts.

533
00:30:14,465 --> 00:30:16,962
To take down Superman?

534
00:30:16,967 --> 00:30:19,598
Not him,

535
00:30:19,603 --> 00:30:21,767
the one he protects.

536
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,345
The Kryptonite is nearly gone.

537
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,147
Doing great, you're almost there.

538
00:30:29,152 --> 00:30:31,482
You're almost there.

539
00:30:33,156 --> 00:30:35,486
That's it, that's it! It's over.

540
00:30:35,491 --> 00:30:37,088
That's it, it's over. You're done.

541
00:30:37,093 --> 00:30:39,090
Hey, you did it, okay? Hey.

542
00:30:39,095 --> 00:30:41,059
Hey, I'm proud of you.

543
00:30:41,064 --> 00:30:43,594
You all right? Come here.

544
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:45,630
I'm proud of you. Come on, stand up.

545
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,532
Stand up.

546
00:30:47,537 --> 00:30:51,436
What do you mean, you don't
know how long it'll affect him?

547
00:30:51,441 --> 00:30:54,772
No, I haven't tested the prototype.

548
00:30:54,777 --> 00:30:57,008
He wasn't exactly in the mood.

549
00:30:57,013 --> 00:30:59,911
Just get me an answer.

550
00:31:09,725 --> 00:31:13,191
Can we just, like... like,
call them or something?

551
00:31:13,196 --> 00:31:17,028
It's named the Fortress
of Solitude for a reason.

552
00:31:17,033 --> 00:31:18,329
I know it sucks.

553
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:21,365
We just have to be patient, okay?

554
00:31:29,545 --> 00:31:30,641
Hey, Lana.

555
00:31:30,646 --> 00:31:33,110
Lois, you know how you kept asking me

556
00:31:33,115 --> 00:31:35,012
if anyone over at Edge EnerCorp

557
00:31:35,017 --> 00:31:36,814
was acting differently?

558
00:31:36,819 --> 00:31:40,685
I just saw it for the first
time with Emily Phan.

559
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,653
- Emily?
- Yeah.

560
00:31:42,658 --> 00:31:45,389
She left in the middle of
her daughter's performance.

561
00:31:45,394 --> 00:31:48,893
She would never do that.
Avery is everything to her.

562
00:31:48,898 --> 00:31:51,062
I mean, it's like she was...

563
00:31:51,067 --> 00:31:53,197
She was someone else.

564
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:57,668
I'll get it.

565
00:31:57,673 --> 00:32:00,004
I guess this is what Edge meant.

566
00:32:00,009 --> 00:32:01,372
What do you mean?

567
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,341
Tonight before I left the office,

568
00:32:03,346 --> 00:32:05,309
he made me an offer

569
00:32:05,314 --> 00:32:07,678
to do what he's doing to everyone else.

570
00:32:07,683 --> 00:32:10,114
- What?
- I turned him down.

571
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:12,717
Lana, why wouldn't you
mention this before?

572
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:15,052
'Cause I was nervous.

573
00:32:15,057 --> 00:32:17,521
He knew I was feeding you information.

574
00:32:17,526 --> 00:32:19,390
Hey, Mom, I think it's for you.

575
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,926
Lois, I'm worried.

576
00:32:21,931 --> 00:32:23,761
What if he does something?

577
00:32:26,769 --> 00:32:29,467
- Mom?
- Lois?

578
00:32:29,472 --> 00:32:32,036
- She shouldn't have called.
- Lois.

579
00:32:39,682 --> 00:32:42,480
Not this time.

580
00:32:42,485 --> 00:32:44,215
Ahh!

581
00:32:46,189 --> 00:32:48,286
This isn't you.

582
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:50,988
Not anymore.

583
00:32:54,964 --> 00:32:57,395
Get out of here!

584
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,996
Keep hitting this till he comes.

585
00:32:59,001 --> 00:33:00,232
- It's all we can do.
- No, no, no, no.

586
00:33:00,236 --> 00:33:02,234
- We need to go to the barn.
- I'll keep 'em busy.

587
00:33:15,017 --> 00:33:17,048
You took his weapons?

588
00:33:19,822 --> 00:33:21,252
Kyle?

589
00:33:21,257 --> 00:33:22,753
I just came from the performance.

590
00:33:22,758 --> 00:33:25,456
Lana was scared. What's going on?

591
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:28,993
- Edge sent people to kill me.
- It's not gonna happen.

592
00:33:40,676 --> 00:33:42,974
Stay down.

593
00:33:54,757 --> 00:33:56,959
Targets first.

594
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:01,626
So that's what Kryptonite
feels like, huh?

595
00:34:01,631 --> 00:34:03,531
Yeah.

596
00:34:11,707 --> 00:34:13,437
Dad?

597
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,285
I'm sorry, Jordan.

598
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,787
Your life right now
is completely changed

599
00:34:29,792 --> 00:34:31,426
because of who I am.

600
00:34:33,229 --> 00:34:36,627
Everything that's happening to you,

601
00:34:36,632 --> 00:34:38,896
you didn't ask for any of this.

602
00:34:41,137 --> 00:34:44,035
I didn't,

603
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,771
but you didn't ask for what
happened to you either.

604
00:35:04,927 --> 00:35:06,724
Here, give me the gun!

605
00:35:19,208 --> 00:35:21,405
Pretty good with that thing.

606
00:35:28,984 --> 00:35:32,049
We're not just gonna kill you, Lois.

607
00:35:32,054 --> 00:35:34,385
He wanted you to suffer first.

608
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,704
They're gone.

609
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:01,621
Better than ice,

610
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:04,991
unless that was a lie
you told me when I was a kid.

611
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,660
Only way I could get you to do it.

612
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:10,363
We sure went through
our fair share of frozen peas,

613
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,430
didn't we?

614
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:12,932
God, even as a kid,

615
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:15,401
you were always coming home bruised up.

616
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:21,140
I was never there to keep you
from getting them though,

617
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:23,075
was I?

618
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,678
- Dad.
- It's true.

619
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:29,288
Everything you said is true.

620
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:33,352
I wasn't the best father.

621
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:37,562
I was gone a lot,

622
00:36:37,623 --> 00:36:42,428
and I wasn't there to protect
you the way a parent should.

623
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:49,902
You were tonight.

624
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:52,342
Couldn't let them hurt my grandson.

625
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,415
Or my little girl.

626
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:09,589
Lois, we're gonna stay here
till this is over.

627
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:11,457
As of now,

628
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:15,228
you, the boys, Clark, Smallville,

629
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,330
that's my priority.

630
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:19,365
Good.

631
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,875
'Cause that war John Henry Irons
was talking about,

632
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:26,672
I think it's about to happen.

633
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:31,043
Think Mom's gonna let you
keep those solar weapons now?

634
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:32,412
I don't know.

635
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:35,148
I mean, they're pretty much the
only reason we're alive, so...

636
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:38,488
It'd suck to come home and
find out I was an only child.

637
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:42,855
Yeah.

638
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,258
So...

639
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:49,061
so you're just, like, fine now?

640
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:52,531
Yeah, other than ice breath.

641
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:54,200
So you have that now for good, or what?

642
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:57,570
- Think so.
- What's that feel like?

643
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:59,572
Like having a piece of wintergreen gum

644
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:01,474
in your mouth at all times.

645
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:02,842
Nice.

646
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:06,145
I can't believe what happened.

647
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,582
Avery Phan's mom and Mr. Cushing?

648
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:11,018
Right, but it wasn't them, you know?

649
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:13,920
They were super, super brainwashed.

650
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:16,656
I think Grandpa's sending a few people

651
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:18,662
to go look for 'em both.

652
00:38:20,459 --> 00:38:24,664
What are they gonna tell Sarah?

653
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:26,465
I don't know.

654
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,570
_

655
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:40,346
- My God, what happened?
- Are you drunk?

656
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:42,982
- No.
- Honey, could you excuse us?

657
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,350
- Mom...
- Please?

658
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:46,990
I need to speak to your father alone.

659
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:52,158
Sure.

660
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,127
- Are you?
- No.

661
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:59,637
No, look, I told you
I am done with all that.

662
00:38:59,642 --> 00:39:02,573
I'm trying to improve myself, Lana.

663
00:39:02,578 --> 00:39:03,628
I really am,

664
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:06,230
but something happened to me tonight.

665
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:09,075
I was at the performance,

666
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,877
and we were talking to Sarah,

667
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:14,246
and then I blacked out.

668
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:16,449
Next thing you know, I'm
out in the middle of a field

669
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:19,351
somewhere outside of town,
and my ribs...

670
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:22,488
my ribs are hurting, and I
don't know how I got there.

671
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:26,095
I don't know what's going on... what?

672
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:30,596
The steps you're taking
to improve yourself...

673
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:33,733
did Morgan Edge make you an offer?

674
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:56,822
How can I help you?

675
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,991
I want to be my best self.

676
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:01,527
I wanted to be better

677
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:05,135
for you and for our girls, babe.

678
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:13,105
Hey, Chrissy.

679
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,373
You said if we kept digging,

680
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:16,208
the answer would present
itself, and honestly,

681
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:17,557
for a while I thought you were nuts

682
00:40:17,561 --> 00:40:18,892
'cause nothing new was coming to light,

683
00:40:18,896 --> 00:40:20,768
but then I got back all the research

684
00:40:20,773 --> 00:40:22,103
on the powered people we know,

685
00:40:22,108 --> 00:40:24,539
and I found this little nugget
that means something.

686
00:40:24,544 --> 00:40:27,044
I just don't know what yet
but thought your big brain

687
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,712
might be able to connect the dots.

688
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,514
Chrissy, what are you talking about?

689
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:34,084
Irma Sayres and David Fuglestad.

690
00:40:34,089 --> 00:40:35,252
Who?

691
00:40:35,257 --> 00:40:38,856
Leslie Larr and motel attacker guy.

692
00:40:38,861 --> 00:40:41,525
Leslie Larr's real name is Irma Sayres?

693
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:44,328
Mm-hmm, and the guy is David Fuglestad,

694
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:45,633
and guess what?

695
00:40:45,638 --> 00:40:49,503
I found out they're both
originally from Smallville.

696
00:40:52,111 --> 00:40:53,941
Derek Powell's from New Carthage.

697
00:40:53,946 --> 00:40:55,976
Reno Rosetti's from Metropolis.

698
00:40:55,981 --> 00:40:59,246
David Fuglestad and
Leslie Larr are from Smallville.

699
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:00,948
When Derek Powell killed himself,

700
00:41:00,953 --> 00:41:02,683
what did he say to you?

701
00:41:02,688 --> 00:41:05,853
- That he was already dead.
- And his powers were fritzing.

702
00:41:05,858 --> 00:41:08,022
Yeah, just like Rosetti's.

703
00:41:08,027 --> 00:41:09,623
That didn't happen when I fought David.

704
00:41:09,628 --> 00:41:11,992
And it didn't happen with Leslie.

705
00:41:16,002 --> 00:41:17,565
When I landed here,

706
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:19,235
there were meteor showers
all over the world

707
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:20,969
for an entire week.

708
00:41:20,974 --> 00:41:23,098
Right, remnants of Krypton.
That's why there's Kryptonite.

709
00:41:23,102 --> 00:41:24,733
Right, every form of Kryptonite,

710
00:41:24,738 --> 00:41:27,635
and the kind that landed here
is buried in the mines.

711
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,404
Was X-Kryptonite.

712
00:41:29,409 --> 00:41:31,806
So the only place in the world
that has X-Kryptonite

713
00:41:31,811 --> 00:41:33,775
is also the only place that has people

714
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,845
who've been exposed to it long
enough to accept its effects.

715
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:40,548
Like Tag Harris.

716
00:41:40,553 --> 00:41:42,817
It's not Smallville Edge needs
to build his army.

717
00:41:42,822 --> 00:41:45,121
It's the people.

718
00:41:49,729 --> 00:41:51,526
What?

719
00:41:51,531 --> 00:41:53,428
It's your ELT.

720
00:41:55,168 --> 00:41:57,132
Edge.

721
00:42:07,113 --> 00:42:09,311
I'm glad you came.

722
00:42:09,316 --> 00:42:11,646
Everything you're doing is gonna stop.

723
00:42:11,651 --> 00:42:13,848
That's exactly what
your friend Lois Lane

724
00:42:13,853 --> 00:42:15,483
keeps saying to me.

725
00:42:15,588 --> 00:42:19,354
You can't make that happen
any more than she can.

726
00:42:30,003 --> 00:42:32,600
Did you really think I'd
be giving people powers

727
00:42:32,605 --> 00:42:34,703
without having them myself?

728
00:42:34,708 --> 00:42:38,707
You see, I got mine the
same time you did, Kal-El,

729
00:42:38,712 --> 00:42:40,508
when I arrived on this planet.

730
00:42:40,513 --> 00:42:42,444
When you arrived?

731
00:42:45,352 --> 00:42:48,516
I think it's time you learned
the truth about who I am

732
00:42:48,521 --> 00:42:52,387
and where I'm really from,

733
00:42:52,392 --> 00:42:54,923
brother.

734
00:43:22,295 --> 00:43:24,995
Greg, move your head!

735
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,500
