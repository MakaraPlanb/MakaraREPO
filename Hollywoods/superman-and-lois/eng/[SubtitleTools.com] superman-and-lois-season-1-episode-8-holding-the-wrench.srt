1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,795
Previously on "Superman & Lois"...

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,365
Let's just focus on what
we came here for: family.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,645
We need to stop Kal-El
before he does to this world

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,050
what he did to mine.

5
00:00:09,055 --> 00:00:11,578
His name is not Luthor.
It's John Henry Irons.

6
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:12,583
You're The Stranger.

7
00:00:19,161 --> 00:00:22,230
Nobody talks to him. I'm going in first.

8
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:39,810
Lois, what a nice surprise.
Thanks for waiting.

9
00:00:39,815 --> 00:00:43,180
Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

10
00:00:43,185 --> 00:00:44,514
I know it's been a while.

11
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:46,350
You know, when they were cadets,

12
00:00:46,355 --> 00:00:47,851
your dad kept my husband

13
00:00:47,856 --> 00:00:51,188
from getting kicked out
of the academy twice.

14
00:00:51,193 --> 00:00:53,661
My door is always open for you.

15
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:59,433
So what brings you in today?

16
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:06,603
We have been having some life changes,

17
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:09,106
pretty major life changes.

18
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,111
Don't get me wrong.

19
00:01:10,116 --> 00:01:12,676
Life has always been complicated.

20
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:15,746
I'm good at complicated, but today

21
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:19,983
I kind of got blindsided and...

22
00:01:19,988 --> 00:01:22,519
just somehow felt like
everything was slipping

23
00:01:22,524 --> 00:01:23,553
through my fingers.

24
00:01:29,264 --> 00:01:32,262
I lost my temper...

25
00:01:32,267 --> 00:01:36,272
and I am worried that if
I can't pull it together,

26
00:01:37,205 --> 00:01:40,003
I'm at risk of hurting
someone I really love

27
00:01:40,008 --> 00:01:42,439
more than I already have.

28
00:01:49,717 --> 00:01:53,016
I know the last few weeks
have been hard on us all.

29
00:01:53,021 --> 00:01:55,118
Bottom line, there's a lot going on.

30
00:01:55,123 --> 00:01:57,851
Morgan Edge, people
suddenly getting powers,

31
00:01:57,856 --> 00:01:59,953
mystery guy trying to kill your dad.

32
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:01,958
So we just wanted to check in

33
00:02:01,963 --> 00:02:04,061
and see how you were
doing with all of it.

34
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:07,030
I talked to Coach Gaines.
He's not happy, but he knows

35
00:02:07,035 --> 00:02:09,132
the three of us are taking
a break from football.

36
00:02:09,137 --> 00:02:11,201
He just needs your uniforms back.

37
00:02:11,206 --> 00:02:13,634
I'll go do it today. It's my last time

38
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,939
in a high school locker
room probably ever.

39
00:02:15,944 --> 00:02:17,804
- Dad?
- No. I'm good.

40
00:02:17,809 --> 00:02:19,309
Can you just hold this?

41
00:02:19,314 --> 00:02:21,578
Yeah.

42
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,018
- Can I be excused, or...
- We're not done talking.

43
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,720
Listen, the stuff that
we're dealing with

44
00:02:29,725 --> 00:02:31,021
would be a lot for anyone,

45
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,956
so if you're stressed or worried,

46
00:02:32,961 --> 00:02:34,624
you need to tell us, okay?

47
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:40,797
That's your dad.

48
00:02:40,802 --> 00:02:43,700
I've got to get to the DOD
and question John Irons.

49
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,536
I'll let you know what I find in the RV.

50
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,505
- Okay.
- Good luck.

51
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,639
Boys.

52
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:56,346
I'll be in the barn. You
two stay out of trouble.

53
00:02:56,351 --> 00:03:01,356
Mom, you think maybe
I could come with you?

54
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:03,362
I don't know, I feel like I wasn't
much help fixing the truck,

55
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:05,162
but I think I could help you.

56
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:06,563
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

57
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,030
Any idea what might be in here?

58
00:03:13,035 --> 00:03:15,699
Not really, but your dad
said it was lined with lead,

59
00:03:15,704 --> 00:03:18,773
so someone is hiding something.

60
00:03:24,346 --> 00:03:28,378
- Classic creepermobile.
- Exactly, so be careful.

61
00:03:28,383 --> 00:03:33,388
Identification required.
Identify yourself.

62
00:03:33,393 --> 00:03:34,789
Lois Lane.

63
00:03:34,794 --> 00:03:37,354
Voice authentication confirmed.

64
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:39,056
Good morning, Lois.

65
00:03:39,061 --> 00:03:40,557
How do you know my name?

66
00:03:40,562 --> 00:03:43,227
You are one of my authorized users.

67
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,295
How can I help you, Ms. Lane?

68
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,832
Um, what can you tell me
about John Henry Irons?

69
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,336
- Careful.
- What is that?

70
00:03:59,148 --> 00:04:03,084
Whoa. That was easy.

71
00:04:05,554 --> 00:04:08,952
What you working on there?

72
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:12,255
Just a list of small businesses in need.

73
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,957
Edge has a new assistance program.

74
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,792
I think it's going to
help a lot of people.

75
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,527
I thought you were just finding people

76
00:04:17,532 --> 00:04:19,129
for his, like, leadership thing.

77
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:22,532
I was, and now that Mr.
Edge has all the people

78
00:04:22,537 --> 00:04:25,802
he needs for that program,
he put me onto this project.

79
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,238
I guess he's just trying
to help as many people

80
00:04:28,243 --> 00:04:31,808
as possible achieve their best
selves, whatever that means.

81
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,910
Look, if he ever decides
to expand that program,

82
00:04:33,915 --> 00:04:35,412
I mean, I'm right here.

83
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:36,980
I know. Sorry, babe.

84
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:40,617
The program is full. I wish
I could've helped you.

85
00:04:40,622 --> 00:04:42,352
Mom, did you help out Mr. Kirker?

86
00:04:42,357 --> 00:04:44,454
Because Jess wants me to audition

87
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:45,922
for this musical revue,

88
00:04:45,927 --> 00:04:48,625
and we haven't spoken
since, like, the third grade.

89
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,194
- What?
- You used to love to perform.

90
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,430
You should definitely try out.

91
00:04:53,435 --> 00:04:54,631
You'd be so good.

92
00:04:54,636 --> 00:04:56,134
And it would give you something to do.

93
00:04:56,138 --> 00:04:58,501
It's tonight, and I don't have
time to prepare anything.

94
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,871
Well, look. Hey, I
got the day off, right?

95
00:05:00,876 --> 00:05:02,672
And you know I got a guitar.

96
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,709
You and me practice together, right?

97
00:05:05,714 --> 00:05:07,877
No, I get... no.

98
00:05:07,882 --> 00:05:08,946
Look, at the end of the day,

99
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,047
if you're not feeling it,
then there's no pressure.

100
00:05:11,052 --> 00:05:13,884
But just a little pressure
because it would be fun.

101
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:18,829
_

102
00:05:23,665 --> 00:05:27,731
- You're a theater kid?
- No. Not...

103
00:05:29,137 --> 00:05:31,668
I was thinking about trying out, but...

104
00:05:31,673 --> 00:05:33,870
You should go for it. Why not?

105
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,272
I get really bad stage fright,

106
00:05:35,277 --> 00:05:37,374
and if you laugh about
this, I will kill you.

107
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,777
No, no, no, no. I, um...

108
00:05:40,782 --> 00:05:42,312
used to play piano.

109
00:05:42,317 --> 00:05:46,322
I did the whole little
kid recital thing.

110
00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:50,153
As I got older and my anxiety got worse,

111
00:05:50,158 --> 00:05:52,122
it got to be a little too much.

112
00:05:52,127 --> 00:05:53,890
I didn't know you played piano.

113
00:05:53,894 --> 00:05:54,926
Well, if you ask me to prove it,

114
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,394
- I'll hyperventilate.
- Noted.

115
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,763
If you try out, let me know,

116
00:05:59,768 --> 00:06:01,898
and I'll come to cheer you on.

117
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:08,199
Yeah, yeah. I know.

118
00:06:08,204 --> 00:06:12,409
I have to return these. See you around.

119
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:13,610
Bye.

120
00:06:38,506 --> 00:06:39,936
I'm going to be right back.

121
00:06:53,521 --> 00:06:56,686
Have a seat, John.

122
00:06:56,691 --> 00:06:59,856
That is your real name, isn't it?

123
00:06:59,861 --> 00:07:02,692
John Henry Irons...

124
00:07:02,697 --> 00:07:05,061
Ranger...

125
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:08,498
two tours in Afghanistan.

126
00:07:08,503 --> 00:07:10,767
Got into the private sector
and made a name for yourself

127
00:07:10,772 --> 00:07:13,603
as a mechanical engineer.

128
00:07:13,608 --> 00:07:15,663
The problem is, John Irons died

129
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:19,483
six years ago under
mysterious circumstances.

130
00:07:21,082 --> 00:07:22,278
At least that's what happened

131
00:07:22,283 --> 00:07:25,682
to the John Irons of this Earth.

132
00:07:25,687 --> 00:07:27,817
How did you get here?

133
00:07:31,726 --> 00:07:33,890
Ballistic shields failing.

134
00:07:39,134 --> 00:07:41,665
Hold on!

135
00:07:44,806 --> 00:07:46,970
Almost there, almost there.

136
00:07:49,244 --> 00:07:51,007
Hang on, hang on!

137
00:07:58,453 --> 00:08:02,652
All you need to know is I'm
the one who's going to end you.

138
00:08:02,657 --> 00:08:04,621
Because you think I'll turn on humanity.

139
00:08:04,626 --> 00:08:05,989
Because you're a traitor, Kal-El,

140
00:08:05,994 --> 00:08:08,090
a soulless monster who feels nothing

141
00:08:08,095 --> 00:08:09,827
for the billions of people
who believe in you.

142
00:08:09,831 --> 00:08:12,270
You have no idea how much
I care about these people.

143
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:13,372
I do know.

144
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:16,199
What happened on my world is
already happening on this one.

145
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,002
The Kryptonians are here,
and you joining them

146
00:08:19,007 --> 00:08:22,739
is the last domino to fall
before it all goes down.

147
00:08:22,744 --> 00:08:26,810
I'm not saying another word
until you bring me Lois Lane.

148
00:08:26,815 --> 00:08:30,180
So John Henry is from another Earth?

149
00:08:30,185 --> 00:08:31,714
Yeah, it's kind of confusing.

150
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,816
Multiverse and parallel universes,

151
00:08:33,821 --> 00:08:36,219
each with its own Earth,
et cetera, et cetera.

152
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,054
So on his Earth are there, like,

153
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,024
are there other versions
of people from here?

154
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:42,492
Yeah. Sometimes.

155
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:49,432
Like you?

156
00:08:49,437 --> 00:08:52,235
Why do you want to see Lois Lane?

157
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,737
- Answer the question.
- Not until I talk to her.

158
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:55,973
She doesn't want to talk to you.

159
00:08:55,977 --> 00:08:57,609
- Let her tell me that.
- You lied to her.

160
00:08:57,613 --> 00:08:59,810
- It was for her own good.
- She doesn't trust you.

161
00:08:59,814 --> 00:09:03,113
You're the one she shouldn't trust!

162
00:09:03,118 --> 00:09:04,814
You're the one who killed them.

163
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:08,351
- What are you talking about?
- She was everything to me.

164
00:09:10,725 --> 00:09:13,623
She was the love of my life,

165
00:09:13,628 --> 00:09:18,127
my wife, the mother of my daughter...

166
00:09:20,535 --> 00:09:23,900
Until you murdered her.

167
00:09:23,905 --> 00:09:26,569
And I won't let you do it again.

168
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,091
I don't really look back with regret.

169
00:09:36,096 --> 00:09:39,701
I reflect, or...

170
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,465
but I don't usually regret, but this?

171
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:49,475
Is it possible you're
being too hard on yourself?

172
00:09:50,842 --> 00:09:53,847
No. I was enraged.

173
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,245
You have no idea the things that I said.

174
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,215
I read your articles, your critiques.

175
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,451
Let's just say I know what
your words are capable of.

176
00:10:05,456 --> 00:10:08,855
I can go full scorched Earth,
and if that is my intention,

177
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,190
you deserve it.

178
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:14,761
But this person didn't.

179
00:10:14,766 --> 00:10:16,963
I think that sometimes,

180
00:10:16,968 --> 00:10:20,567
words cut so deep

181
00:10:20,572 --> 00:10:23,236
that they forever change
how you see a person.

182
00:10:25,577 --> 00:10:29,108
And I don't know how fix this.

183
00:10:29,113 --> 00:10:30,610
We'll figure this out.

184
00:10:30,615 --> 00:10:32,445
We've been in similar situations.

185
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,477
Learning that the man who's
trying to kill your husband

186
00:10:34,481 --> 00:10:36,081
is your other husband
from another world?

187
00:10:36,086 --> 00:10:37,991
It kind of feels like new ground to me.

188
00:10:37,996 --> 00:10:39,897
I meant the part about
having to clean up the mess

189
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:41,601
caused by an evil version of you.

190
00:10:41,606 --> 00:10:44,812
Lois, look at these articles.
I mean, other than the suit,

191
00:10:44,817 --> 00:10:46,447
this guy was just like me

192
00:10:46,452 --> 00:10:48,383
right up until he started
killing innocent people.

193
00:10:48,387 --> 00:10:50,651
Clark, it doesn't matter.
That's not you.

194
00:10:50,656 --> 00:10:53,154
And if John Henry wants
to save humanity here,

195
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,922
he has to accept that.

196
00:10:54,927 --> 00:10:57,358
You really think that's possible,

197
00:10:57,363 --> 00:10:59,327
knowing everything he's lost?

198
00:10:59,332 --> 00:11:04,232
His wife? His daughter, Natalie?

199
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,270
Look, Lois, I can come home,

200
00:11:09,275 --> 00:11:11,372
and we can talk about this right now.

201
00:11:11,377 --> 00:11:13,241
Clark, no. I feel sorry for him,

202
00:11:13,246 --> 00:11:15,009
but that was his life on his Earth.

203
00:11:15,014 --> 00:11:18,946
He's here now and we need answers.

204
00:11:18,951 --> 00:11:20,551
Maybe I should go talk to him.

205
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:22,049
No. No, not yet.

206
00:11:22,054 --> 00:11:23,718
I understand where he's coming from now.

207
00:11:23,723 --> 00:11:26,020
I think maybe I can get through to him.

208
00:11:26,025 --> 00:11:27,288
I hope so.

209
00:11:28,761 --> 00:11:31,025
We need him to tell us
how to save our world.

210
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:38,599
- I love you, Lois.
- I love you, too.

211
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:44,605
Hey, Mom.

212
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,641
- Hey.
- You good?

213
00:11:46,646 --> 00:11:49,810
Yeah. Let's just... let's
take a break from the RV.

214
00:11:49,815 --> 00:11:51,646
I'll let you know before
I want to go back in.

215
00:12:05,064 --> 00:12:07,599
Ta-da!

216
00:12:08,968 --> 00:12:11,032
You're being ridiculous.

217
00:12:11,037 --> 00:12:13,434
I'm excited. Go on. Open it.

218
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,407
That box ain't going
to open itself. Come on.

219
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,886
Sheet music?

220
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:26,756
From just about every musical ever!

221
00:12:26,761 --> 00:12:30,931
Okay, pick one, and let's get
you warmed up. All right?

222
00:12:34,427 --> 00:12:36,958
Um.

223
00:12:36,963 --> 00:12:40,228
Dad...

224
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:42,430
I can't.

225
00:12:42,435 --> 00:12:44,866
Sarah, come on now,
you're a great singer.

226
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:46,934
You've been singing in choir for years.

227
00:12:46,939 --> 00:12:49,937
Exactly. It's easier
to perform with people.

228
00:12:49,942 --> 00:12:52,106
There's safety in numbers.

229
00:12:52,111 --> 00:12:55,743
Fifth grade, you had that big
solo in the Christmas pageant.

230
00:12:55,748 --> 00:12:57,812
You remember that? Now,
you'd have killed that

231
00:12:57,817 --> 00:12:59,980
if you hadn't gotten food
poisoning, I just know it.

232
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:07,221
I didn't get food poisoning.

233
00:13:07,226 --> 00:13:08,256
Sarah.

234
00:13:08,261 --> 00:13:10,159
Dad, it's fine whenever I'm with people.

235
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,394
It's just whenever I'm by myself,

236
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,463
it feels like I have this
weight on my chest.

237
00:13:15,468 --> 00:13:19,400
If that feeling of
wanting to sing is greater

238
00:13:19,405 --> 00:13:20,905
than that fear of getting up there,

239
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,673
well, then you got to try it.

240
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:26,377
I mean, the fear is just short pain.

241
00:13:26,382 --> 00:13:29,481
Regret, that...

242
00:13:30,016 --> 00:13:31,078
that lasts a lot longer.

243
00:13:38,457 --> 00:13:41,822
I do want to do it.

244
00:13:41,827 --> 00:13:43,591
Okay.

245
00:13:43,596 --> 00:13:45,660
- Yeah.
- Okay. Then you ready?

246
00:13:45,665 --> 00:13:48,729
Okay.

247
00:13:54,273 --> 00:13:56,137
It's time to change tactics.

248
00:13:56,142 --> 00:13:57,972
Trask can get us what we need.

249
00:13:57,977 --> 00:13:59,840
No. No, not like this.

250
00:13:59,845 --> 00:14:01,075
We don't torture people.

251
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,377
What we do and don't
do is not your call,

252
00:14:03,382 --> 00:14:06,347
so Lieutenant Trask will tap in

253
00:14:06,352 --> 00:14:08,182
if I can't get him to talk first.

254
00:14:08,187 --> 00:14:09,550
You're going in?

255
00:14:09,555 --> 00:14:11,753
Where he's from, we're allies.

256
00:14:11,758 --> 00:14:13,187
I could use that.

257
00:14:13,192 --> 00:14:15,556
Not that I don't have
faith in you, General,

258
00:14:15,561 --> 00:14:17,291
but I'm going to get my things.

259
00:14:30,176 --> 00:14:32,807
Sorry I didn't get to meet you, sis.

260
00:14:32,812 --> 00:14:34,308
You seem really cool.

261
00:14:39,952 --> 00:14:43,651
And we must defeat them
if we are to save humanity,

262
00:14:43,656 --> 00:14:45,820
for that is what separates us from them.

263
00:14:45,825 --> 00:14:47,888
Our humanity.

264
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:51,559
I love you, girls.

265
00:15:26,165 --> 00:15:29,930
- Identification required.
- Okay, okay, Jonathan Kent.

266
00:15:29,935 --> 00:15:30,935
Jon... Jon Kent.

267
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,305
Warning. You are not authorized.

268
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,240
- In T-minus 20 seconds...
- No.

269
00:15:36,245 --> 00:15:38,439
- You will be eliminated.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

270
00:15:38,444 --> 00:15:40,374
20. 19...

271
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:42,613
- Mom! Mom!
- 18...

272
00:15:45,522 --> 00:15:46,918
- Jon!
- Mom! Mom!

273
00:15:46,923 --> 00:15:48,253
Jon!

274
00:15:48,258 --> 00:15:51,216
Mom, I'm not authorized!
It's going to kill me!

275
00:15:51,221 --> 00:15:53,051
This is Lois Lane! He's my son!

276
00:15:53,056 --> 00:15:55,787
- Ten...
- Stop the countdown!

277
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:57,656
- Eight...
- Clark!

278
00:15:57,661 --> 00:15:59,758
Clark! Clark!

279
00:16:00,768 --> 00:16:03,465
Clark, the AI is going to kill Jon!

280
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,700
Two, one...

281
00:16:25,923 --> 00:16:27,586
Are you okay?

282
00:16:30,227 --> 00:16:32,424
Are you out of your mind?

283
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:34,659
You don't go snooping around

284
00:16:34,664 --> 00:16:38,096
some guy from another
world's murder van!

285
00:16:38,101 --> 00:16:41,166
I mean, I... I thought
it was safe earlier.

286
00:16:41,171 --> 00:16:44,236
Jonathan, nothing is as it
seems with this kind of stuff.

287
00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:46,671
I said I would go back
in there with you.

288
00:16:46,676 --> 00:16:48,306
What were you thinking?

289
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:49,775
I just thought I'd look around.

290
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,143
Without me?

291
00:16:52,148 --> 00:16:54,046
Jonathan, what were you
really doing in there?

292
00:16:54,051 --> 00:16:59,356
Mom, even I knew how
upset you were earlier

293
00:16:59,361 --> 00:17:01,158
about what we saw in there,

294
00:17:01,163 --> 00:17:04,263
and then that crazy hammer
thing that he made,

295
00:17:04,268 --> 00:17:05,298
I thought that maybe

296
00:17:05,303 --> 00:17:07,573
I could go in there
and I could look for...

297
00:17:07,578 --> 00:17:09,362
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on.
You were looking for weapons?

298
00:17:09,366 --> 00:17:14,371
Dad, you and Jordan
basically are weapons.

299
00:17:14,376 --> 00:17:18,308
I am the only one in this house
that is completely unarmed.

300
00:17:18,313 --> 00:17:20,372
Jonathan, your mother
and I will protect you.

301
00:17:20,377 --> 00:17:21,577
- Really?
- Yes!

302
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:25,787
Because I was one second
away from being dead,

303
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:28,580
and Mom couldn't do anything, and you?

304
00:17:28,585 --> 00:17:30,385
You almost didn't even make it in time.

305
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,521
Jonathan, look at me. Look at me!

306
00:17:33,526 --> 00:17:36,421
I let you come with me
because I trusted you.

307
00:17:36,426 --> 00:17:39,324
I trusted that you were
responsible enough

308
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:42,360
to know what's at stake, to know
how dangerous this all is!

309
00:17:42,365 --> 00:17:45,664
- So now you don't trust me?
- Okay, let's calm down.

310
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:47,099
You knew there was a risk!

311
00:17:47,104 --> 00:17:49,835
I know you did, and
yet you went in anyway,

312
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,704
alone, behind my back!

313
00:17:52,709 --> 00:17:54,773
What... to find weapons?

314
00:17:54,778 --> 00:17:58,110
You almost died, not
because you were unarmed,

315
00:17:58,115 --> 00:18:00,879
because you were reckless and stupid!

316
00:18:00,884 --> 00:18:02,184
And if you had died,

317
00:18:02,189 --> 00:18:05,754
the only person that would've
been to blame is yourself.

318
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:07,689
Get out of my face!

319
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,627
Okay, okay.

320
00:18:18,068 --> 00:18:20,599
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine, Clark.

321
00:18:20,604 --> 00:18:24,102
Okay, okay. I'm going
to mark that as a no.

322
00:18:24,107 --> 00:18:26,538
- He could've been killed.
- I know, I know.

323
00:18:26,543 --> 00:18:29,507
And it was scary, and... I don't know.

324
00:18:29,512 --> 00:18:33,017
Do you think maybe you
were, like, a little harsh?

325
00:18:33,984 --> 00:18:36,282
Do you want to talk about
what you saw in the RV earlier?

326
00:18:36,286 --> 00:18:40,291
- I said I'm fine, Clark.
- Okay, okay, okay.

327
00:18:42,058 --> 00:18:45,991
Look, I know you can handle anything,

328
00:18:45,996 --> 00:18:48,226
but it is okay to ask for help.

329
00:18:48,231 --> 00:18:50,228
And I want to be that
person for you always,

330
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:53,532
but I also understand
if I'm not right now.

331
00:18:53,537 --> 00:18:56,668
What about the woman you talked
to before, your dad's friend?

332
00:18:56,673 --> 00:18:59,871
- Dr. Wiles.
- Is she still at the DOD?

333
00:18:59,876 --> 00:19:03,442
Just think about it. I'm going
to go check on Jonathan.

334
00:19:11,955 --> 00:19:13,752
- Mr. Cushing?
- Ms. Larr.

335
00:19:13,757 --> 00:19:17,456
- You're here to see Lana?
- Yeah.

336
00:19:17,461 --> 00:19:19,057
Our daughter has got this school thing

337
00:19:19,062 --> 00:19:22,026
she's auditioning for, and
I snuck a recording of us

338
00:19:22,031 --> 00:19:26,031
practicing and her singing
and me on guitar.

339
00:19:26,036 --> 00:19:27,732
Anyway, Lana is going to love it.

340
00:19:27,737 --> 00:19:29,201
A man of many talents.

341
00:19:29,206 --> 00:19:33,211
It's why we're so disappointed
you turned down our offer.

342
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,874
- Beg your pardon?
- Just know that Mr. Edge

343
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:38,009
is quite interested in you.

344
00:19:38,014 --> 00:19:40,545
I know he hopes you'll reconsider.

345
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:43,409
I appreciate that.

346
00:19:43,414 --> 00:19:47,819
I don't know, $150.000?
That's a lot of money.

347
00:19:47,824 --> 00:19:49,421
Yeah, but it's not a loan.

348
00:19:49,426 --> 00:19:53,631
It's a grant, and Mr. Edge
believes in your business.

349
00:19:53,636 --> 00:19:55,961
Now you can remodel the store.

350
00:19:55,966 --> 00:19:58,797
- Lana? I need to talk to you.
- Okay.

351
00:19:58,802 --> 00:20:01,937
- It's important.
- Mm-hmm. Excuse me.

352
00:20:04,007 --> 00:20:08,012
Hey, what's wrong? You seem upset.

353
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:11,109
- Did you lie to me?
- What?

354
00:20:11,114 --> 00:20:13,745
Leslie Larr said Morgan Edge
wanted me for that position.

355
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,981
If Morgan Edge wants me,
and I want the job,

356
00:20:15,986 --> 00:20:18,683
well, then what's the problem?

357
00:20:18,688 --> 00:20:20,519
There's no position for you, Kyle.

358
00:20:20,524 --> 00:20:21,786
That's not what Larr said.

359
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,922
Well, she doesn't know everything.

360
00:20:23,927 --> 00:20:25,790
Come on, Lana. She's his right hand.

361
00:20:29,766 --> 00:20:33,131
Edge doesn't think you're
leadership material.

362
00:20:33,136 --> 00:20:36,534
Well, he respects you and
everything you've done for him,

363
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:38,637
which is why he didn't
say anything to her.

364
00:20:42,045 --> 00:20:45,343
You should... you should
probably get back to work.

365
00:20:56,393 --> 00:20:57,756
Think you can sit here

366
00:20:57,761 --> 00:21:00,492
and waste my time
like this is some joke?

367
00:21:00,497 --> 00:21:03,395
I didn't say anything funny.

368
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,729
Other side of that mirror,

369
00:21:04,734 --> 00:21:06,998
there's a guy ready to come in here

370
00:21:07,003 --> 00:21:09,701
with Sodium Pentothal, benzilate,

371
00:21:09,706 --> 00:21:11,369
a few other drugs I can't pronounce,

372
00:21:11,374 --> 00:21:13,371
some experimental.

373
00:21:13,376 --> 00:21:16,875
But they'll get you to tell
me what I want to know.

374
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,177
Well, that is funny.

375
00:21:19,182 --> 00:21:21,146
You see, where I'm from, you talk tough,

376
00:21:21,151 --> 00:21:23,582
but you would never drug
or torture prisoners.

377
00:21:23,587 --> 00:21:25,984
You've been sitting here
telling me about myself

378
00:21:25,989 --> 00:21:27,389
because I was your father-in-law

379
00:21:27,394 --> 00:21:28,557
in some other world.

380
00:21:28,562 --> 00:21:31,189
If I meant something to you,

381
00:21:31,194 --> 00:21:34,159
tell me something I want to know.

382
00:21:34,164 --> 00:21:37,128
You want to know how you died?

383
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:41,138
Like a hero trying to save the world...

384
00:21:42,505 --> 00:21:44,836
until he murdered you.

385
00:21:44,841 --> 00:21:47,072
You can't trust him, Sam.

386
00:21:47,077 --> 00:21:48,077
You're wrong.

387
00:21:48,082 --> 00:21:50,408
What if there were more
Kryptonians, a dozen or so,

388
00:21:50,413 --> 00:21:52,210
and he decided he was loyal to them?

389
00:21:52,215 --> 00:21:56,220
- He won't turn.
- They are his people.

390
00:21:56,686 --> 00:21:59,851
He would choose his kind over mankind.

391
00:21:59,856 --> 00:22:01,920
And what chance would you have?

392
00:22:13,903 --> 00:22:16,701
Let him stew, then stick
him back in his cell.

393
00:22:18,408 --> 00:22:20,472
You and I should talk.

394
00:22:22,479 --> 00:22:25,277
Is there a reason you haven't
told me everything?

395
00:22:25,282 --> 00:22:26,878
What do you mean?

396
00:22:26,883 --> 00:22:28,780
I'm just wondering
who you lashed out at,

397
00:22:28,785 --> 00:22:32,290
who you're worried won't
look at you the same.

398
00:22:33,056 --> 00:22:36,788
My son, Jonathan. You
should get better chairs.

399
00:22:36,793 --> 00:22:39,891
Lois, what happened today?

400
00:22:39,896 --> 00:22:43,161
John did something
stupid, and I got mad.

401
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:44,896
Want to talk about what he did?

402
00:22:44,901 --> 00:22:49,034
He went out and got himself in trouble.

403
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,970
Honestly, it's a miracle he's alive.

404
00:22:51,975 --> 00:22:55,811
Sounds like whatever
happened, it scared you.

405
00:22:59,216 --> 00:23:01,283
You have no idea.

406
00:23:04,454 --> 00:23:07,986
It's like it's hard enough
being a parent,

407
00:23:07,991 --> 00:23:09,687
raising them and caring for them,

408
00:23:09,692 --> 00:23:13,658
and then they get old enough
and still a part of you

409
00:23:13,663 --> 00:23:14,926
is just out in the world,

410
00:23:14,931 --> 00:23:17,528
like your heart is just out there

411
00:23:17,533 --> 00:23:20,865
and anything can happen to it,
and there's nothing you can do.

412
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:24,069
It sounds like you felt
helpless, powerless.

413
00:23:26,876 --> 00:23:28,907
Not like I have in a long time.

414
00:23:28,912 --> 00:23:31,209
I'm sure.

415
00:23:31,214 --> 00:23:34,379
Probably not since your miscarriage.

416
00:23:38,288 --> 00:23:40,852
You helped me a lot back then.

417
00:23:40,857 --> 00:23:44,055
You only came the once.

418
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,590
With my job, it's kind of hard enough

419
00:23:45,595 --> 00:23:49,127
making time for my family.

420
00:23:49,132 --> 00:23:50,929
Miscarriages are pretty common.

421
00:23:50,934 --> 00:23:54,132
Common, yes, but they
can also be traumatic.

422
00:23:54,137 --> 00:23:58,142
And as I recall, you already
had a name picked out.

423
00:24:00,076 --> 00:24:04,081
We were going to name her
after my grandmother,

424
00:24:04,714 --> 00:24:07,379
Natalie.

425
00:24:11,488 --> 00:24:12,917
Lieutenant Trask.

426
00:24:12,922 --> 00:24:15,387
Here's an idea. You go on break.

427
00:24:15,392 --> 00:24:18,256
Leave me and my friend here
alone for ten minutes.

428
00:24:18,261 --> 00:24:20,646
Negative. He's going back to his cell.

429
00:24:20,651 --> 00:24:22,231
General Lane's orders.

430
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:25,730
You know your problem, Rosetti?

431
00:24:25,735 --> 00:24:28,370
You're a stickler for the rules.

432
00:24:31,941 --> 00:24:35,106
You know your problem? Nothing.

433
00:24:35,111 --> 00:24:36,841
Your problems are over.

434
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,285
Now you, your problems
are just getting started.

435
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:54,680
Look, I get how important
it is to grieve the loss.

436
00:24:54,685 --> 00:24:56,216
I read all the books, all the websites.

437
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,083
I'm just one of those
people that copes better

438
00:24:58,088 --> 00:24:59,788
when there's more on my plate, not less.

439
00:24:59,793 --> 00:25:02,121
It helps me focus.

440
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:05,791
I just wonder, given the
emotions you describe

441
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:07,793
and the way you reacted to Jonathan,

442
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:10,129
if you needed more time
to process your grief.

443
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:13,432
I used my vacation days.
I allowed myself the time.

444
00:25:13,437 --> 00:25:15,734
Lois, why did you yell at Jonathan?

445
00:25:15,739 --> 00:25:18,838
- He put himself in danger.
- That's why you lost control?

446
00:25:18,843 --> 00:25:21,240
I told you, he scared me.

447
00:25:21,245 --> 00:25:22,708
That's it? Nothing else?

448
00:25:22,713 --> 00:25:24,343
What else do you want me to say?

449
00:25:24,348 --> 00:25:25,878
That he was only there because of me,

450
00:25:25,883 --> 00:25:29,148
and that if he had gotten hurt or worse,

451
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:30,549
it would've been because of me?

452
00:25:30,554 --> 00:25:34,559
I can't lose another
child because of me.

453
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:38,190
Lois, we respond to grief in many ways,

454
00:25:38,195 --> 00:25:40,059
but you have to realize, this...

455
00:25:40,064 --> 00:25:41,461
Is this the part where you tell me

456
00:25:41,465 --> 00:25:43,095
the miscarriage wasn't my fault?

457
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,331
Because...

458
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:49,201
the guilt that I feel is real.

459
00:25:49,206 --> 00:25:51,151
I never stopped working.

460
00:25:51,156 --> 00:25:54,306
Work, exercising, having sex,
lifting something heavy,

461
00:25:54,311 --> 00:25:56,041
that's not why you lost your child.

462
00:25:56,046 --> 00:25:57,376
You don't know that.

463
00:25:57,381 --> 00:26:00,546
The majority of miscarriages
are caused by a genetic issue.

464
00:26:00,551 --> 00:26:01,881
Yeah, I know, but...

465
00:26:01,886 --> 00:26:05,217
Lois, you have control over
your life in a way most don't,

466
00:26:05,222 --> 00:26:07,620
but the things you can't control,

467
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:10,689
you have to learn to accept
them and let them go.

468
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:14,460
Your miscarriage wasn't
because of something you did

469
00:26:14,465 --> 00:26:15,961
or didn't do.

470
00:26:15,966 --> 00:26:17,997
It was something that happened to you.

471
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:24,270
I was so excited to meet her.

472
00:26:24,275 --> 00:26:27,139
I wish there was a shortcut,

473
00:26:27,144 --> 00:26:30,543
but you have to allow yourself

474
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:33,212
to go through the grieving process,

475
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:36,315
no matter how much time it takes

476
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,025
- because when you don't...
- Yeah, I know.

477
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:43,556

00:27:57,134 --> 00:28:01,639

♪ Let your little light shine ♪

527
00:29:39,303 --> 00:29:42,735

528
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,105
Are you still considering Trask?

529
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,706
Actually, I think we need Lois.

530
00:29:47,711 --> 00:29:50,075
- Oh, come on, Sam.
- She can handle herself.

531
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,011
I know she can, and
normally I would agree,

532
00:29:52,015 --> 00:29:55,581
but this guy was married to
another world's version of her.

533
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:59,118
They had a family, a child,
a daughter named Natalie.

534
00:29:59,123 --> 00:30:04,128
After my mother? Same
name as the baby you lost.

535
00:30:07,036 --> 00:30:11,130
Yeah. It's weird, but

536
00:30:11,135 --> 00:30:13,098
there's no time for weird.

537
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:16,068
I'm trying to save the world,
and the best chance we have

538
00:30:16,073 --> 00:30:17,503
to figure out his agenda

539
00:30:17,508 --> 00:30:21,373
is to let my daughter do
what she does best.

540
00:30:21,378 --> 00:30:22,908
I know this facility.

541
00:30:22,913 --> 00:30:25,012
If you wanted the fastest exit,
we should've made that left.

542
00:30:25,016 --> 00:30:26,913
We're making a pit stop.

543
00:30:26,918 --> 00:30:28,680
At an armed dealer.

544
00:30:30,988 --> 00:30:33,019
I get it. You're afraid.

545
00:30:33,024 --> 00:30:35,121
If you make a break, Superman
might have to track you

546
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,488
wherever you're taking me.

547
00:30:36,493 --> 00:30:38,091
Or is it because you can't face him?

548
00:30:38,095 --> 00:30:39,925
I can beat Superman.

549
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:42,161
I have all the power he has,

550
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:45,631
and the extra advantage I need...

551
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:46,733
is right here.

552
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,937
I get to watch you kill each other.

553
00:30:55,913 --> 00:30:57,342
Status?

554
00:30:57,347 --> 00:31:00,279
- Sir, alarms in Sector Five.
- Where's Irons?

555
00:31:00,284 --> 00:31:02,381
Unknown. Cams are down
and unconfirmed reports

556
00:31:02,386 --> 00:31:05,617
put a body in prisoner holding.

557
00:31:05,622 --> 00:31:08,053
Sir, it's Trask. He's dead, sir.

558
00:31:08,058 --> 00:31:10,489
- Get me eyes on Rosetti.
- I'll find him.

559
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:14,092
Wait. It's Sector Five. You can't go.

560
00:31:14,097 --> 00:31:16,396
That's where you're keeping
your stockpile of kryptonite.

561
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,197
It's a research and development lab,

562
00:31:18,202 --> 00:31:22,407
about a dozen prototypes
for kryptonite-based weapons,

563
00:31:22,412 --> 00:31:25,243
fragment grenades, bladed weapons,

564
00:31:25,248 --> 00:31:27,673
aerosol sprays, biochemical gas.

565
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:29,374
Bottom line, you go down there,

566
00:31:29,379 --> 00:31:31,176
there's a chance you
don't come back alive.

567
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,276
Talk to me, General.
I'm blind down here.

568
00:31:44,281 --> 00:31:47,413
The feed is still out,
but you can't miss it.

569
00:31:47,418 --> 00:31:50,416
It's number 7734.

570
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,127
Where's Irons?

571
00:32:01,132 --> 00:32:03,863
Whatever he's got planned,
I can help you.

572
00:32:03,868 --> 00:32:05,298
You've got it all wrong.

573
00:32:05,303 --> 00:32:07,367
The only prisoner who needs help is you.

574
00:32:17,248 --> 00:32:20,213
The entire facility is on lockdown?

575
00:32:20,218 --> 00:32:22,014
Get me General Lane.

576
00:32:38,135 --> 00:32:39,332
Go.

577
00:32:58,222 --> 00:32:59,919
Anyone not in a red cape,

578
00:32:59,924 --> 00:33:02,388
consider them armed
and extremely dangerous.

579
00:33:02,393 --> 00:33:06,025
Dad, what's going on?

580
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,605
You see? You're on the wrong side.

581
00:33:59,817 --> 00:34:03,822
You're lucky I have
a mission to complete.

582
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,605
On my world, we had our own 7734.

583
00:34:22,006 --> 00:34:25,871
Out of all the weapons I
used to kill Kryptonians,

584
00:34:25,876 --> 00:34:28,107
this was my favorite.

585
00:34:28,112 --> 00:34:30,276
I'm not your enemy.

586
00:34:30,281 --> 00:34:32,344
I figure, why take the chance?

587
00:34:32,349 --> 00:34:34,647
Drop the weapon now!

588
00:34:34,652 --> 00:34:36,449
- Stop!
- Hold your fire!

589
00:34:39,123 --> 00:34:41,854
You wanted to see me? Here I am.

590
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:44,890
- You should go, Lois.
- I'm not going anywhere.

591
00:34:47,164 --> 00:34:50,669
- Suit yourself.
- John, I know about Natalie!

592
00:34:51,735 --> 00:34:54,200
I know what happened on your world,

593
00:34:54,205 --> 00:34:57,870
to you, and to your family.

594
00:34:57,875 --> 00:34:59,605
Then you know why I have to do this.

595
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:01,040
Please.

596
00:35:01,045 --> 00:35:03,576
Please, I see the anger in your eyes.

597
00:35:03,581 --> 00:35:06,312
It's covering something I can relate to:

598
00:35:06,317 --> 00:35:09,415
the torture that comes from
wondering if you failed,

599
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,951
if there was something you
could've done to save them,

600
00:35:11,956 --> 00:35:15,588
but there wasn't. If there had
been, you would've found it.

601
00:35:15,593 --> 00:35:19,592
They're gone, and it's not your fault,

602
00:35:19,597 --> 00:35:21,760
but it's not his fault, either.

603
00:35:21,765 --> 00:35:23,195
You don't know what's coming.

604
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,731
John, our worlds are different.

605
00:35:25,736 --> 00:35:28,868
Our Superman is good.

606
00:35:28,873 --> 00:35:32,878
He would never turn on us, ever.

607
00:35:33,844 --> 00:35:37,849
- How can you know that?
- I know.

608
00:35:37,854 --> 00:35:40,051
And if you kill him,

609
00:35:40,056 --> 00:35:43,561
an innocent man, a hero,

610
00:35:44,622 --> 00:35:47,553
what does that make you?

611
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,730
Sounds like you're on the mend.

612
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,699
Yeah. Breathing is better.
That was some nasty stuff.

613
00:36:15,704 --> 00:36:19,409
The gas was an experimental,
synthetic kryptonite

614
00:36:20,073 --> 00:36:22,404
designed to invade
your respiratory system,

615
00:36:22,409 --> 00:36:24,406
weaken you from the inside,

616
00:36:24,411 --> 00:36:27,943
leave you vulnerable to
more traditional tactics.

617
00:36:27,948 --> 00:36:29,913
You should know it was
my sincere intention

618
00:36:29,918 --> 00:36:31,294
none of this would ever be deployed.

619
00:36:31,298 --> 00:36:35,384
Sam, I want to save you the
trouble of lying to my face.

620
00:36:41,461 --> 00:36:43,592
I hope for the best,

621
00:36:43,597 --> 00:36:46,361
but it's my job to
prepare for the worst,

622
00:36:46,366 --> 00:36:49,198
even when it comes to you.

623
00:36:49,203 --> 00:36:51,767
I am sorry you had
to find out like this.

624
00:36:51,772 --> 00:36:55,404
- Trust goes both ways.
- I know.

625
00:36:55,409 --> 00:36:58,207
And I know I have some
work to do to regain yours.

626
00:37:01,848 --> 00:37:04,079
- About Rosetti...
- Mm.

627
00:37:04,084 --> 00:37:06,482
He was third-generation military.

628
00:37:06,487 --> 00:37:08,717
Loved his job, his country,

629
00:37:08,722 --> 00:37:11,486
never showed a hint
of superhuman ability.

630
00:37:11,491 --> 00:37:13,822
And what if it wasn't him?

631
00:37:13,827 --> 00:37:16,158
When Derek Powell killed himself,

632
00:37:16,163 --> 00:37:19,761
he implied that he was someone else,

633
00:37:19,766 --> 00:37:21,763
said that I wasn't alone anymore.

634
00:37:21,768 --> 00:37:24,766
- Meaning what, exactly?
- I don't know.

635
00:37:24,771 --> 00:37:26,935
Lois has a theory.

636
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:30,072
She thinks that Morgan Edge
has found a way

637
00:37:30,077 --> 00:37:33,682
to transfer alien sentience
into human hosts.

638
00:37:34,348 --> 00:37:35,377
Kryptonians?

639
00:37:38,151 --> 00:37:41,683
Are you telling me John Irons
might be right?

640
00:37:41,688 --> 00:37:43,252
It's very possible that Morgan Edge

641
00:37:43,257 --> 00:37:45,354
is building an army.

642
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,755
Congratulations.

643
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,895
Mr. Edge has singled out everyone here

644
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,431
for their fearless devotion to our team.

645
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:52,933
As soon as he's back in town,

646
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:54,668
he'll speak to each of you individually,

647
00:37:54,673 --> 00:37:58,233
and I assure you your
loyalty will be rewarded.

648
00:37:58,238 --> 00:38:01,637
You will each achieve
your perfect selves.

649
00:38:21,295 --> 00:38:24,526
Sarah.

650
00:38:24,531 --> 00:38:26,528
I'm sorry, okay?

651
00:38:26,533 --> 00:38:29,231
Look, I'd just gotten some bad news

652
00:38:29,236 --> 00:38:31,812
about a job opportunity, you know?

653
00:38:31,817 --> 00:38:36,922
And I just felt like I needed
to blow off some steam.

654
00:38:37,577 --> 00:38:41,076
The next thing you know,
I missed your audition,

655
00:38:41,081 --> 00:38:44,586
and at that point, I was so...

656
00:38:45,585 --> 00:38:47,149
look, I know.

657
00:38:47,154 --> 00:38:50,285
I know I messed up, and I promise you...

658
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:52,387
Don't!

659
00:38:52,392 --> 00:38:56,797
Just don't promise me anything.

660
00:38:57,597 --> 00:38:59,896
If you're going to do whatever
you're going to do, just do it.

661
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,898
That's fine. I just...

662
00:39:02,903 --> 00:39:05,534
I keep getting my hopes up

663
00:39:05,539 --> 00:39:08,704
and then just get disappointed.

664
00:39:08,709 --> 00:39:10,876
Again.

665
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,711
Sarah.

666
00:39:26,193 --> 00:39:28,257
Guy tries to kill Dad,
and now he's, what,

667
00:39:28,262 --> 00:39:30,192
he's our houseguest?

668
00:39:30,197 --> 00:39:32,527
I really don't think Mom
would let him stay here

669
00:39:32,532 --> 00:39:33,595
if he was dangerous.

670
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,865
After everything that
she saw in that trailer,

671
00:39:35,869 --> 00:39:38,600
you really trust her judgment right now?

672
00:39:41,742 --> 00:39:44,506
I guess I deserve that.

673
00:39:44,511 --> 00:39:46,808
Give me a minute alone
with your brother.

674
00:39:46,813 --> 00:39:48,377
Yeah.

675
00:40:04,264 --> 00:40:06,561
When you and your brother
were about 18 months old,

676
00:40:06,566 --> 00:40:09,264
I got pregnant.

677
00:40:09,269 --> 00:40:11,099
And I ended up losing the baby,

678
00:40:11,104 --> 00:40:15,109
so it's really not something
I talk about much,

679
00:40:15,842 --> 00:40:19,975
but we were going to name her Natalie.

680
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,245
Yeah, exactly.

681
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:27,255
All this time I thought I was okay...

682
00:40:27,721 --> 00:40:31,086
and then just being reminded
of the child that I lost

683
00:40:31,091 --> 00:40:34,356
and then almost losing you, I lost it,

684
00:40:34,361 --> 00:40:37,025
and I said some things
I never should've said

685
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:40,428
and that I didn't mean,
but that's no excuse,

686
00:40:40,433 --> 00:40:42,798
and I never should've
yelled at you like that,

687
00:40:42,803 --> 00:40:44,633
and I'm so sorry, and
I love you so much,

688
00:40:44,638 --> 00:40:45,834
and I hope you forgive me.

689
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:49,604
Mom, it's okay. I understand.

690
00:40:49,609 --> 00:40:54,814
Promise me you will never go
rogue on me like that again.

691
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:56,649
I just wanted to help.

692
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:58,380
Jon, if there's anyone in this family

693
00:40:58,385 --> 00:41:00,315
who gets what you're
going through, it's me.

694
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:04,052
I know what it's like to be
in the orbit of someone

695
00:41:04,057 --> 00:41:07,354
who can juggle semitrucks,
and you want to help out.

696
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,025
You want to save the world,
and all you can do

697
00:41:09,029 --> 00:41:12,734
is just stand there holding the wrench.

698
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,131
And I know the fear of being vulnerable,

699
00:41:16,136 --> 00:41:20,235
and I will teach you
some ways to handle that.

700
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,671
But right now, I just want you to know

701
00:41:21,675 --> 00:41:23,638
that we're on the same team.

702
00:41:23,643 --> 00:41:26,174
We are the extraordinary humans

703
00:41:26,179 --> 00:41:29,578
in a family of superpeople,

704
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:31,413
and we have to stick together.

705
00:41:50,003 --> 00:41:54,069
Looks like you pretty much recovered.

706
00:41:54,074 --> 00:41:56,104
More or less.

707
00:41:56,109 --> 00:41:58,740
And I'm free to just drive out of here.

708
00:41:58,745 --> 00:41:59,841
It's simple.

709
00:41:59,846 --> 00:42:01,543
If there really is a war coming,

710
00:42:01,548 --> 00:42:04,813
we're going to need
all the help we can get.

711
00:42:04,818 --> 00:42:06,048
This is a show of trust.

712
00:42:06,053 --> 00:42:08,450
I let you live.

713
00:42:08,455 --> 00:42:10,485
Doesn't mean I'm ready
to fight by your side.

714
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:12,687
I understand.

715
00:42:12,692 --> 00:42:16,697
If you change your mind,
you know how to find me.

716
00:42:18,832 --> 00:42:20,495
Ms. Lane.

717
00:42:31,177 --> 00:42:34,843
I hope you find some solace.

718
00:42:34,848 --> 00:42:37,212
There's a lot I want to say,

719
00:42:37,217 --> 00:42:39,981
but you're not the woman
I want to say it to.

720
00:42:42,155 --> 00:42:45,253
You just look like her,

721
00:42:45,258 --> 00:42:49,157
so I will leave you with, "Godspeed".

722
00:42:58,038 --> 00:43:00,936
Welcome back, Captain Luthor.

723
00:43:03,076 --> 00:43:06,241
Erase the profile for Captain Luthor.

724
00:43:06,246 --> 00:43:10,011
Start a new one for me:
John Henry Irons.

725
00:43:10,016 --> 00:43:11,780
Certainly.

726
00:43:16,256 --> 00:43:20,155
Shall I set a course
for a new destination?

727
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,525
How about you shut down?

728
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:25,360
Think I'll just drive for a while.

729
00:43:25,365 --> 00:43:27,963
As you wish, John.

730
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:09,830
Greg, move your head!

731
00:44:09,835 --> 00:44:14,335
