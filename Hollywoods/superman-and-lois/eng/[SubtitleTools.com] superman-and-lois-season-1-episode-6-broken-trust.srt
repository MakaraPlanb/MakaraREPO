1
00:00:01,088 --> 00:00:02,775
Previously,
on "Superman & Lois"...

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:04,689
Your mom wanted us
to move to Smallville.

3
00:00:04,774 --> 00:00:07,511
- This family needs Smallville.
- I think I did this to him.

4
00:00:07,596 --> 00:00:09,675
The bonfire... I think my heat
vision caused an explosion

5
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:10,823
and infected him somehow.

6
00:00:10,908 --> 00:00:12,010
Where's Tag now?

7
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,621
He's with the doctors
at the DOD.

8
00:00:13,706 --> 00:00:15,955
So what exactly brings
a Reuters tech reporter

9
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,471
- to Smallville, Kansas?
- Just want to be on Team Lois.

10
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,699
I think I may have found a way
to get a look inside the mines.

11
00:00:20,783 --> 00:00:21,763
I don't think it was Derek.

12
00:00:21,847 --> 00:00:23,678
His powers were erratic,
like Tag Harris.

13
00:00:23,762 --> 00:00:25,564
Well, whatever Edge
and Leslie are doing

14
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:26,777
with that machine,
it has something

15
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:27,846
to do
with the mines.

16
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:29,806
We now own the rights
to this land,

17
00:00:29,891 --> 00:00:33,003
which holds enough X-Kryptonite
to resurrect an army.

18
00:00:33,088 --> 00:00:35,125
[dramatic music]

19
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:37,674
- Tag.
- What did you do to me?

20
00:00:44,322 --> 00:00:46,223
Try and outrun me?

21
00:00:46,307 --> 00:00:47,783
Not anymore.

22
00:00:48,019 --> 00:00:49,763
Tag, I don't know what...

23
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:52,027
[high-pitched ringing]
[groans]

24
00:00:52,313 --> 00:00:54,405
[echoing]
I want the truth, Kent.

25
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:57,060
At the bonfire party,
when you broke my arm,

26
00:00:57,221 --> 00:00:59,062
what did you do to me?

27
00:00:59,146 --> 00:01:02,065
I don't know what
you're talking about.

28
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:03,715
Liar!

29
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:08,071
Ever since that night,
I have been different.

30
00:01:08,155 --> 00:01:11,465
I can move so fast.
And I saw Teague's video.

31
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:13,424
Something caused
that explosion.

32
00:01:13,508 --> 00:01:15,948
You were right there.

33
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:19,125
And I know
you're different, too.

34
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:22,473
You better tell me
how to fix it.

35
00:01:24,693 --> 00:01:26,698
- Superman.
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

36
00:01:26,782 --> 00:01:28,091
Wait!

37
00:01:28,175 --> 00:01:30,699
- Are you okay? Are you okay?
- Yeah.

38
00:01:44,408 --> 00:01:46,587
[train horn blows]

39
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:48,064
Tag, don't!

40
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,983
He got you pretty good, kid.

41
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:36,985
[groans] It's all right.

42
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:38,378
Yeah, I thought you had,

43
00:02:38,462 --> 00:02:41,468
like, super durability
or whatever.

44
00:02:41,552 --> 00:02:43,514
I don't know what I have.

45
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:48,475
I tried to fight back,
but he was stronger and faster.

46
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:50,564
My head is pounding.

47
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:52,523
Your abilities are evolving.

48
00:02:52,607 --> 00:02:54,438
You can heal faster,
but you can still get hurt.

49
00:02:54,522 --> 00:02:57,310
What did... what did Tag
want, anyways?

50
00:02:57,394 --> 00:02:59,138
Answers.

51
00:02:59,222 --> 00:03:00,835
He wanted to know
how he got powers,

52
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:03,969
why he's at the DOD...
He thinks I did this to him.

53
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:07,668
- Why would he think that?
- Because he saw the video

54
00:03:07,752 --> 00:03:10,193
of the explosion
I caused at the mines.

55
00:03:10,277 --> 00:03:12,717
I know. Look, he doesn't know
everything,

56
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:15,894
but he know something's up.

57
00:03:15,978 --> 00:03:18,157
What if he says something? I mean...

58
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:20,991
Guys, can you just give me
and your mom a second

59
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,246
to talk about this, please?

60
00:03:25,074 --> 00:03:27,993
[dramatic music]

61
00:03:28,077 --> 00:03:32,128
[♪]

62
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,953
- I hate the Internet.
- [chuckles]

63
00:03:37,835 --> 00:03:39,710
Your dad called.

64
00:03:39,795 --> 00:03:41,800
Assured me that he's on this.

65
00:03:41,885 --> 00:03:44,673
Apparently Tag escaped the DOD
by some fluke.

66
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,110
His abilities accelerated.

67
00:03:46,195 --> 00:03:47,765
They didn't know
what he was capable of.

68
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,551
And now they're putting
together some plan to track him

69
00:03:49,635 --> 00:03:50,726
and get him back in custody.

70
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,467
And if he gets
to Jordan first?

71
00:03:52,551 --> 00:03:54,295
I'll keep an eye out.

72
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:56,035
This wouldn't be happening
if it wasn't for Morgan Edge.

73
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:59,038
Whatever gave Tag those powers
came from those mines,

74
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:00,605
and now he wants
to extract more of it

75
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:02,999
and make more Derek Powells.

76
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,870
- What if you went there?
- I flew over the mines.

77
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:06,698
I scanned the tunnels.
I can't see inside.

78
00:04:06,782 --> 00:04:08,526
They've lined them
with lead fiber.

79
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,354
So I need to investigate.

80
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:12,574
Find proof of wrongdoing,
hand it over

81
00:04:12,658 --> 00:04:14,663
to the authorities,
and get a proper warrant.

82
00:04:14,747 --> 00:04:16,462
Slow down, okay?
I can find out...

83
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,548
No, I want you focused
on the boys

84
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,582
until Tag is back in custody.

85
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:23,411
In the meantime, I got to break
this case open.

86
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:26,805
Think about it... Edge is giving
people Kryptonian powers.

87
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:28,807
And all of this
at the same time

88
00:04:28,892 --> 00:04:33,294
some armored lunatic arrives
who knows Superman's real name?

89
00:04:33,548 --> 00:04:37,816
You think Morgan Edge
is the Stranger?

90
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,819
Maybe. I don't know.

91
00:04:40,903 --> 00:04:42,252
I'm gonna find out.

92
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,088
Dude, Jimmy Cutter's
literally been talking

93
00:04:49,172 --> 00:04:51,134
smack about the game all week.

94
00:04:51,218 --> 00:04:53,049
That guy's such a dick.

95
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:55,483
Hey. Hey. Language.

96
00:04:56,702 --> 00:04:59,055
[high-pitched ringing]

97
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:00,914
- You okay?
- Yeah.

98
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:03,654
- Yeah. It's just a headache.
- Hmm.

99
00:05:05,361 --> 00:05:07,062
Jordan, how would you feel

100
00:05:07,147 --> 00:05:10,153
about sitting out
tomorrow's game?

101
00:05:10,237 --> 00:05:11,502
Why?

102
00:05:11,586 --> 00:05:13,330
Well, for one,

103
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:15,593
you might still be affected
by what happened with Tag.

104
00:05:15,677 --> 00:05:17,552
Well, what does that have
to do with football?

105
00:05:17,636 --> 00:05:19,467
Yeah, Dad, I mean, look,
it's Metropolis, okay?

106
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:22,295
This is literally
the biggest game of the season.

107
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:23,993
It's our old school.
I mean...

108
00:05:24,077 --> 00:05:25,473
Yeah, I know. I get that,
but until we have this

109
00:05:25,557 --> 00:05:27,388
under control,
we've got to be careful.

110
00:05:27,472 --> 00:05:29,738
Dad, I have to play
in this game.

111
00:05:29,822 --> 00:05:32,523
It's really important to me.

112
00:05:32,607 --> 00:05:33,829
Please?

113
00:05:33,913 --> 00:05:35,744
You promise
you're 100% healthy?

114
00:05:35,828 --> 00:05:38,399
- Yeah.
- Totally good to go?

115
00:05:38,483 --> 00:05:41,445
- Totally good to go.
- Okay. All right.

116
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:44,753
Then after school,
you're gonna prove it.

117
00:05:44,837 --> 00:05:48,017
This is proof my suspicions
were correct.

118
00:05:48,101 --> 00:05:50,672
Smallville is the community
that's going to help me

119
00:05:50,756 --> 00:05:52,848
change the world.

120
00:05:52,932 --> 00:05:54,327
So, without further ado,

121
00:05:54,411 --> 00:05:56,112
I'll hand over
to my wonderful staff,

122
00:05:56,196 --> 00:05:59,245
who can assist in getting you
all back to work.

123
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:00,812
- Yeah.
- Thank you very much.

124
00:06:00,896 --> 00:06:03,685
Yeah.
[chuckles]

125
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:05,513
Oh, Mr. Edge,

126
00:06:05,597 --> 00:06:08,211
this is gonna put a lot
of people back on their feet.

127
00:06:08,295 --> 00:06:09,908
I cannot thank you enough.

128
00:06:09,992 --> 00:06:11,954
No, no, I'm the one
who should be thanking you.

129
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,174
All this is possible
because of your advocacy,

130
00:06:15,258 --> 00:06:17,525
persuading people
to give me a shot.

131
00:06:17,609 --> 00:06:21,093
In fact, I'd like
to capitalize on our momentum.

132
00:06:21,177 --> 00:06:23,008
Hey, whatever you need,
you say the word.

133
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:26,055
Well, the Smallville team
needs a strong leader.

134
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:29,098
And I'd like to fill
that role with you, Lana.

135
00:06:31,623 --> 00:06:33,192
- With me?
- The work you did at the bank

136
00:06:33,276 --> 00:06:34,716
with reverse mortgages

137
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,327
shows me you're not
just highly competent.

138
00:06:37,411 --> 00:06:39,547
You also have
the people's trust.

139
00:06:39,631 --> 00:06:43,159
And I want to use that trust
to revitalize Smallville,

140
00:06:43,243 --> 00:06:46,336
starting with
the community center.

141
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,382
- Yeah.
- I'm grateful.

142
00:06:49,466 --> 00:06:52,777
[chuckles]
I-I don't know what to say.

143
00:06:52,861 --> 00:06:55,867
Well, when you see
your new starting salary,

144
00:06:55,951 --> 00:06:58,391
- you'll say yes.
- [chuckles]

145
00:06:58,475 --> 00:07:01,394
[dramatic music]

146
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:08,184
[♪]

147
00:07:08,268 --> 00:07:11,796
- Should I deal with her?
- Why bother?

148
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,495
What can she do?

149
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:17,582
[indistinct chatter]

150
00:07:21,847 --> 00:07:23,939
Figured out how to get
in there yet?

151
00:07:24,023 --> 00:07:25,894
Doing about as well
as you, Marcus.

152
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,423
May the best reporter in.

153
00:07:30,507 --> 00:07:32,121
Uh, he's just worried
about you man.

154
00:07:32,205 --> 00:07:33,601
You need to cut Dad
a little slack.

155
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:35,603
I know he's just
looking out for me,

156
00:07:35,687 --> 00:07:39,215
but he thinks I'm made
of glass.

157
00:07:39,299 --> 00:07:40,782
This is my shot to finally show

158
00:07:40,866 --> 00:07:42,435
those Metropolis d-bags
who's boss.

159
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:45,613
Come on.
I'm not gonna sit that out.

160
00:07:45,697 --> 00:07:48,050
I get that.
But I'm just saying... what?

161
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,052
You don't have to
slam it every time.

162
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,706
Dude, I didn't even
slam it at all.

163
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,055
Oh, hey, guys.

164
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,665
Oh, my God,
what happened to your face?

165
00:07:54,749 --> 00:07:56,319
Um...

166
00:07:56,403 --> 00:07:59,235
Did you get beat up
on your way home or something?

167
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:01,193
We were running plays this
morning in the front yard,

168
00:08:01,277 --> 00:08:03,239
and then I juked him,
and he tripped and fell.

169
00:08:03,323 --> 00:08:05,067
Well, I hope you do better
tomorrow at the game,

170
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,634
'cause I'd hate to go
all the way to Metropolis

171
00:08:06,718 --> 00:08:08,157
just to see you eat it.

172
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:09,985
- You're coming?
- Uh, yeah.

173
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:12,941
Friends can root
for friends, right?

174
00:08:15,422 --> 00:08:16,818
I think I'm starting to see

175
00:08:16,902 --> 00:08:18,689
why you're so hyped
for this game, huh?

176
00:08:18,773 --> 00:08:20,430
- [school bell ringing]
- [groans]

177
00:08:20,514 --> 00:08:22,693
What?
Hey, hey, hey, Jordan, Jordan.

178
00:08:22,777 --> 00:08:25,261
[echoing] What's going on?
Hey. Hey.

179
00:08:25,345 --> 00:08:28,043
[continues indistinctly]

180
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:34,836
Jordan. Jordan.
Look at me, look at me.

181
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,839
Just breathe. Just breathe.
Please, just breathe.

182
00:08:37,923 --> 00:08:40,058
[breathing heavily]

183
00:08:40,142 --> 00:08:42,974
Hey. Hey.
What the hell was that?

184
00:08:43,058 --> 00:08:46,238
Okay, that is not...
That is not a panic attack.

185
00:08:46,322 --> 00:08:48,066
It's my head.

186
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,851
Since Tag jumped me,

187
00:08:49,935 --> 00:08:53,289
I've been hearing this
really loud high-pitched noise.

188
00:08:53,373 --> 00:08:57,075
Jordan, if this has to do
with your superpowers,

189
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,990
then you need to tell Dad.

190
00:08:59,074 --> 00:09:00,513
You might need to go
to the fortress

191
00:09:00,597 --> 00:09:02,515
to figure out what's wrong.

192
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:04,256
- We can't tell Dad, all right?
- Jordan, you need to tell him.

193
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,736
Look, if we tell Dad,

194
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,955
he won't let me play football
tomorrow.

195
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,306
- Jordan.
- Jon, let me have this.

196
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,091
Those Metropolis guys... Woodrum,
Cutter, Campana...

197
00:09:13,175 --> 00:09:15,616
They've made my life hell.

198
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,226
Just let me shut them up,
just this once.

199
00:09:24,186 --> 00:09:25,756
All right, bye.

200
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,718
It's Bill Hastings.
He starts work next week.

201
00:09:30,802 --> 00:09:33,677
Hadn't heard him this excited
since Junior was born.

202
00:09:33,761 --> 00:09:36,201
You're changing lives, babe.

203
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:37,725
Yeah.

204
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:40,118
Hey. You okay?

205
00:09:40,202 --> 00:09:41,638
Yeah.

206
00:09:45,207 --> 00:09:48,910
It's silly, but I don't know,
I just... I thought

207
00:09:48,994 --> 00:09:53,131
that Edge might have
had something for me, you know?

208
00:09:53,215 --> 00:09:55,003
Some managerial work
or something like that.

209
00:09:55,087 --> 00:09:57,353
But do you really want that?

210
00:09:57,437 --> 00:10:00,530
I mean,
you love being a fireman,

211
00:10:00,614 --> 00:10:02,140
and if I'm getting
this promotion,

212
00:10:02,224 --> 00:10:03,922
isn't
that a win for both of us?

213
00:10:05,445 --> 00:10:07,232
[doorbell rings]

214
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:10,842
I'll be right back, baby.
[door opens]

215
00:10:11,843 --> 00:10:14,762
Lois. Let me go grab Lana.

216
00:10:14,846 --> 00:10:19,592
Actually, Kyle, I was hoping
that I could talk to you, too.

217
00:10:19,676 --> 00:10:21,290
Come on in.

218
00:10:21,374 --> 00:10:24,380
This may sound bizarre,
but I have reason to believe

219
00:10:24,464 --> 00:10:26,164
that Morgan Edge is engaged

220
00:10:26,248 --> 00:10:28,732
in both illegal
and dangerous activity,

221
00:10:28,816 --> 00:10:30,691
and I'm asking for your help
to get into the mines

222
00:10:30,775 --> 00:10:32,214
so that I can prove it.

223
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,868
So let me get this straight.

224
00:10:33,952 --> 00:10:36,261
Even though Edge just gave Lana
this massive promotion,

225
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:37,959
you want us
to go behind his back

226
00:10:38,043 --> 00:10:40,526
and help you with a news story.

227
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:43,613
- I know it's a big ask.
- It's pretty big, yeah.

228
00:10:45,398 --> 00:10:47,664
Listen, I'm not alone
in my suspicions.

229
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,144
You both know
that I know Superman.

230
00:10:49,228 --> 00:10:50,841
He's looking into Edge, too.

231
00:10:50,925 --> 00:10:54,453
- Superman? What for?
- I can't tell you that yet.

232
00:10:54,537 --> 00:10:56,064
Of course you can't.

233
00:10:56,148 --> 00:10:57,935
But does Clark know
about this?

234
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:00,982
He doesn't know I'm here, no.
I'm just trying to explain...

235
00:11:01,066 --> 00:11:02,331
Explain what?

236
00:11:02,415 --> 00:11:04,246
You've got no proof.
You got no evidence.

237
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,248
Kyle, I would tell you
if I could.

238
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,206
I am asking you to trust me.

239
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,687
Oh, okay, you want me
to trust you?

240
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:12,123
You know what I should do
is, I should call Edge

241
00:11:12,207 --> 00:11:13,516
and we should get
a restraining order.

242
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,387
Okay, Kyle, please.

243
00:11:15,471 --> 00:11:18,129
Listen, I just got off
the phone with a buddy of mine

244
00:11:18,213 --> 00:11:21,176
who hadn't worked
in eight months.

245
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,831
He's got mouths to feed, Lois.

246
00:11:23,915 --> 00:11:25,833
And right now
Edge is the only person

247
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:28,009
that's giving his family
a chance to survive.

248
00:11:28,093 --> 00:11:29,967
I know it seems like
he's helping,

249
00:11:30,051 --> 00:11:33,449
- but he has...
- No, he is helping...

250
00:11:33,533 --> 00:11:35,796
a lot more than you are.

251
00:11:39,017 --> 00:11:41,587
I came to you guys
because you're my friends

252
00:11:41,671 --> 00:11:43,198
and I need help.

253
00:11:43,282 --> 00:11:46,505
I know I maybe be biased,
but you don't know

254
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:49,117
what it's like
to see this town dry up.

255
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:52,685
The things I've see...
Foreclosing on people...

256
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:55,598
This is our chance to help.

257
00:11:58,036 --> 00:12:00,473
I'm sorry, Lois.

258
00:12:04,738 --> 00:12:07,222
Lana, you know
that I respect you.

259
00:12:07,306 --> 00:12:10,529
So I am telling you, something
sinister is going on here.

260
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:14,359
And you might not find out
what it is until it's too late.

261
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:16,492
So just be careful.

262
00:12:16,576 --> 00:12:19,495

265
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:28,069
- So why are we down here?
- Training.

266
00:12:28,153 --> 00:12:30,027
This is stuff your grandfather
used to teach me

267
00:12:30,111 --> 00:12:31,899
how to control my strength.

268
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:33,901
Now it's my turn
to give you a few pointers.

269
00:12:33,985 --> 00:12:36,381
Why, so he can, like, protect
himself from Tag or something?

270
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:39,167
Well, there's that,
and given your raw power,

271
00:12:39,251 --> 00:12:41,430
we want to make sure
you can control it.

272
00:12:41,514 --> 00:12:45,129
Yeah, I mean, a random super
freak-out would really suck.

273
00:12:45,213 --> 00:12:47,828
- Yeah.
- Anyway...

274
00:12:47,912 --> 00:12:50,961
let's start with this.

275
00:12:51,045 --> 00:12:53,616
Am I somehow supposed
to crack this in half?

276
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,314
Nope. Just punch it.

277
00:12:56,398 --> 00:12:58,534
Don't I need gloves
or something?

278
00:12:58,618 --> 00:13:00,141
You trust me?

279
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,104
[mutters]

280
00:13:10,238 --> 00:13:11,590
Ouch.

281
00:13:11,674 --> 00:13:13,070
- Thanks, Dad.
- Yep. Yep. Okay.

282
00:13:13,154 --> 00:13:14,637
No, I thought we'd try
going on instinct,

283
00:13:14,721 --> 00:13:16,247
but obviously that was
the wrong approach.

284
00:13:16,331 --> 00:13:18,075
Um, right foot back.
Put your hand up like a fist.

285
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:22,601
Curl your thumb. Bring it back.
Transfer the weight.

286
00:13:22,685 --> 00:13:23,864
Follow through.

287
00:13:23,948 --> 00:13:25,604
Okay.

288
00:13:25,688 --> 00:13:28,085
Jordan...

290
00:13:30,816 --> 00:13:32,424
is Cutter's face.

He's just laughing at you.
Pop him. You got it.

Come on, believe you can do
this, and you will.

You're stronger than
you think you are.

- You got it.
- Now.

00:13:43,968 --> 00:13:46,930
Yes! Yes!

296
00:13:47,014 --> 00:13:48,932
Yo, that's what
I'm talking about!

297
00:13:49,016 --> 00:13:52,283
- Yes, sir. Oh, my God.
- See? Line it up again.

298
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:54,024
- Line it up again.
- Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

Hey, Sam.

302
00:13:58,765 --> 00:14:00,596
Harris was spotted
in Metropolis.

303
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,815
In Metropolis?
Are you sure?

304
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:05,340
He's fast, hard to track.

305
00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:07,733
Why?
Something I need to know about?

306
00:14:07,817 --> 00:14:11,389
Uh, that's where the boys'
football game is tomorrow.

307
00:14:11,473 --> 00:14:13,739
You stay with the boys.
I'll have my guys on site.

308
00:14:13,823 --> 00:14:17,004
We have a plan to put this
monster back in his cage.

309
00:14:17,088 --> 00:14:19,006
He's not a monster, Sam.
He's a kid.

310
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,529
Nobody's helping him.
He's scared.

311
00:14:20,613 --> 00:14:24,011
Helping?
He attacked my grandson.

312
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:27,014
No, I underestimated him once.

313
00:14:27,098 --> 00:14:29,755
He broke out
of a state-of-the-art facility.

314
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,148
His speed rivals yours.

315
00:14:31,232 --> 00:14:33,194
No telling what damage
he can do.

316
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:34,847
I don't have time to worry
about feelings.

317
00:14:34,931 --> 00:14:36,632
I need to incapacitate
a threat.

318
00:14:36,716 --> 00:14:38,199
That's what I'm gonna do.

I'm trying.

But nobody we know
is available for tomorrow.

What's tomorrow?

Wow.

himself long enough to think,

"Maybe I should
congratulate my wife."

329
00:15:03,047 --> 00:15:06,009
Were you listening
to our conversation?

330
00:15:06,093 --> 00:15:09,404
It's not that big of a house.

- Sarah.
- Mom.

Your new job, it's kind of,
like, a really big deal,

337
00:15:33,686 --> 00:15:37,603
and you absolutely deserve
to go and celebrate.

00:15:39,387 --> 00:15:41,088
I guess.

Yeah. You work really hard.

And you give back
to the community.

342
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:50,659

all the karma you're getting.

00:16:17,512 --> 00:16:18,473
We are now
in the second quarter

349
00:16:18,557 --> 00:16:21,215
of a surprisingly close game.

350
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:23,608
There's no show in showtime
if we don't show up!

351
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:26,611
- Hey. You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

352
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:30,789
Hey, short stack, you see
that linebacker, 55. out there?

353
00:16:30,873 --> 00:16:32,182
He's been killing us all day.

354
00:16:32,266 --> 00:16:33,879
Now, look,
I want you to go in there

355
00:16:33,963 --> 00:16:37,144
and you knock him
on his backside, you got that?

356
00:16:37,228 --> 00:16:40,886
Let's go. Let's go!
[crowd cheering]

357
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:45,543
Gonna stick your ass, Jo-Jo.
Just like grade school.

358
00:16:45,627 --> 00:16:47,806
[whistle blows]

359
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,809
- [groans]
- [high-pitched ringing]

360
00:16:50,893 --> 00:16:54,291
Here we go.
Keep them out!

361
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:57,033
Come on, now! Jeez!

362
00:16:57,117 --> 00:17:01,904
Oh! Looks like the Crows'
quarterback is hurt.

363
00:17:05,256 --> 00:17:06,956
Timmy's got
a sprained elbow.

364
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,827
Tried telling Jordan
it's not really his fault.

365
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:10,699
- [chuckles]
- Yeah, I'm sure that helped.

366
00:17:10,783 --> 00:17:13,005
What about our other problem?
Any sign of our friend Tag?

367
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:15,530
No. There's a pretty big
DOD presence.

368
00:17:15,614 --> 00:17:17,184
Guess I should thank
your dad for that.

369
00:17:17,268 --> 00:17:19,011
Well, the sooner
we find that kid,

370
00:17:19,095 --> 00:17:20,578
the sooner this
will all be over.

371
00:17:20,662 --> 00:17:23,320
Yeah.
It's the how that worries me.

372
00:17:23,404 --> 00:17:25,366
Clark, with everything
that's going on,

373
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,368
are you sure Jordan's okay?

374
00:17:27,452 --> 00:17:29,065
I don't know.

375
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,198
Something's going on,
but he won't talk to me.

376
00:17:31,282 --> 00:17:33,374
Keep an eye on him,
on both of them.

377
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,376
This can't be easy for them,
playing their old school

378
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,595
and seeing
all the kids they knew.

379
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,031
Yeah.

380
00:17:39,115 --> 00:17:41,512
- [whistle blows]
- Hut!

381
00:17:41,596 --> 00:17:43,427
Come on!

382
00:17:43,511 --> 00:17:45,690
We got to do our job!
Pick it up now!

383
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:47,039
Let's go!
Focus!

384
00:17:47,123 --> 00:17:49,651
Coach.
We need to throw that ball.

385
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,479
I don't got
a quarterback, Kent.

386
00:17:51,563 --> 00:17:53,263
You do, Coach.
You got me.

387
00:17:53,347 --> 00:17:55,178
I mean, I know our plays.

388
00:17:55,262 --> 00:18:00,009
I know their defense.
I got this, okay?

389
00:18:00,093 --> 00:18:01,576
All right, Kent.

390
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,361
Strong right slot,
Z panther, on three.

391
00:18:04,445 --> 00:18:05,971
- Got it.
- Let's go!

392
00:18:06,055 --> 00:18:07,538
Go get them, 12.

393
00:18:07,622 --> 00:18:09,671
What a game
this has been so far.

394
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,151
There is no love lost
between these two teams.

395
00:18:11,235 --> 00:18:12,848
Whoo-hoo. Big boy Kent.

396
00:18:12,932 --> 00:18:15,720
Hey, you know I'm with your
girl Eliza now, right?

397
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,766
She wanted you to know.

398
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,200
Blue 72. Hike!

399
00:18:24,335 --> 00:18:27,471
Ball, ball, ball!

400
00:18:27,555 --> 00:18:30,692
- Touchdown, Smallville.
- Yeah! Attaboy!

401
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:34,086
You like that, Cutter?

402
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,653
Hey. Jordan.

403
00:18:35,737 --> 00:18:37,130
Get over here.

404
00:18:39,306 --> 00:18:42,269
- Rein it in, or you're done.
- Just making a block.

405
00:18:42,353 --> 00:18:44,575
That's not what I'm talking
about, and you know it.

406
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:46,142
You understand me?

407
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:48,968
- Yeah.
- Good. Go sit down.

408
00:18:50,448 --> 00:18:53,062
Hell, use me
as your unnamed source.

409
00:18:53,146 --> 00:18:55,760
All I need is a press pass
from the "Post."

410
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:58,981
[knock at door]
I'll call you back.

411
00:18:59,065 --> 00:19:01,897
No, I'm not mad.
Just find me a pass.

412
00:19:01,981 --> 00:19:04,900
[dramatic music]

413
00:19:04,984 --> 00:19:11,991
[♪]

414
00:19:13,775 --> 00:19:15,215
[knock at door]

415
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:17,086
Who is it?

416
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,259
Your new best friend.

417
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:26,182
What are you
doing here, Marcus?

418
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:28,489
Still open to sharing
a byline?

419
00:19:28,573 --> 00:19:31,579
Friend of mine got hands
on a couple inspector badges.

420
00:19:31,663 --> 00:19:35,278
One's for you, if you want it.

421
00:19:35,362 --> 00:19:37,672
You somehow get not one
but two inspector badges

422
00:19:37,756 --> 00:19:40,193
and you're just gonna give me
one of them to be nice?

423
00:19:42,761 --> 00:19:45,723
They're working around the
clock to get those mines ready.

424
00:19:45,807 --> 00:19:48,552
Right now the tunnels
are packed with inspectors.

425
00:19:48,636 --> 00:19:51,076
Security is stretched thin.

426
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,340
A lone Black guy
might look suspicious,

427
00:19:53,424 --> 00:19:56,343
but the two of us together,
it'll seem more legit.

428
00:19:56,427 --> 00:19:57,996
So...

429
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,781
are you in...

430
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,870
or out?

431
00:20:01,954 --> 00:20:03,350
Are you kidding me?

432
00:20:03,434 --> 00:20:05,177
This is your idea
of a disguise?

433
00:20:05,261 --> 00:20:07,179
- It's kind of a clown show.
- Let me do the talking, okay?

434
00:20:07,263 --> 00:20:09,660
You just try
to look inspector-y.

435
00:20:09,744 --> 00:20:13,098
- Inspector-y.
- Mine Safety.

436
00:20:13,182 --> 00:20:15,013
That team checked
in hours ago.

437
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:16,580
Had to grab more equipment.

438
00:20:16,664 --> 00:20:20,932
Dude, between you and me,
Sullivan is an idiot.

439
00:20:21,016 --> 00:20:23,457
[both laugh]
He can't plan a survey.

440
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,676
- All right, go ahead.
- All right, cool. Thanks, man.

441
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,983
[chuckles]

442
00:20:28,067 --> 00:20:30,551
You want to watch a classic?
There's "Wizard of Oz."

443
00:20:30,635 --> 00:20:32,161
But I like animation.

444
00:20:32,245 --> 00:20:34,424
We can get a new one
on streaming.

445
00:20:34,508 --> 00:20:36,731
No, I'm not gonna buy...
Look, Soph,

446
00:20:36,815 --> 00:20:39,560
I'm fine with the whole, like,
Saturday sister bonding time.

447
00:20:39,644 --> 00:20:41,126
Kind of embrace it.

448
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,563
But, dude, seriously,
we're gonna have to find

449
00:20:42,647 --> 00:20:44,086
something
we both want to watch.

450
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,436
Please?

451
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,395
- [doorbell rings]
- Okay, that's the pizza guy.

452
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:49,784
Get up.

453
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:53,356
Okay, go get your stuffies
and your blankets,

454
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,749
and then you can pick
whatever movie you want.

455
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,403
Just...

456
00:20:56,487 --> 00:20:59,141
I'll be back after I'm done
emotionally preparing.

457
00:21:01,317 --> 00:21:02,583
Love you, too.

458
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:05,237
- Love you.
- Little brat.

459
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:07,805
[sighs]

460
00:21:07,889 --> 00:21:09,851
- Tag.
- Hey, Sarah.

461
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,461
Thought you went to go live
with your dad.

462
00:21:11,545 --> 00:21:13,202
Are you back in town?

463
00:21:13,286 --> 00:21:17,249
The truth is complicated.

464
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,600
And you've always been
my friend.

465
00:21:19,684 --> 00:21:23,430
You stick up for people when
you know something isn't fair.

466
00:21:23,514 --> 00:21:25,124
No!

467
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,955
Sarah. Sarah.

468
00:21:32,566 --> 00:21:35,442
The Crows lead 35-13
in the fourth quarter,

469
00:21:35,526 --> 00:21:37,618
with only seconds left
on the clock.

470
00:21:37,702 --> 00:21:41,056
Nobody saw this coming, least
of all the Metropolis players.

471
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,971
They look absolutely stunned.

472
00:21:43,055 --> 00:21:45,884
Blue, 72. Hut. Hut. Hike!

473
00:21:50,454 --> 00:21:51,980
- Go! Go!
- Whoo!

474
00:21:52,064 --> 00:21:53,242
Touchdown, Crows!

475
00:21:53,326 --> 00:21:54,591
Yeah! Attaboy!

476
00:21:54,675 --> 00:21:56,854
The Crows win.
What an upset!

477
00:21:56,938 --> 00:21:58,552
[groaning]

478
00:21:58,636 --> 00:22:00,641
Looks like a fight
has broken out midfield.

479
00:22:00,725 --> 00:22:02,294
I don't think
I've ever seen

480
00:22:02,378 --> 00:22:04,598
- anything like this!
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

481
00:22:06,731 --> 00:22:08,689
Get off him!

482
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,567
Hey. Hey. Jordan, you okay?

483
00:22:13,651 --> 00:22:15,917
I can't hold it in.

484
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,485
- Let it out.
- Let it out right now.

485
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:22,442
[screaming]

486
00:22:29,188 --> 00:22:31,846
I had a really
good time tonight.

487
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,325
Well, good,

488
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:36,111
'cause that dinner
wasn't cheap.

489
00:22:36,195 --> 00:22:39,419
[both chuckle]

490
00:22:39,503 --> 00:22:42,117
Listen, um...

491
00:22:42,201 --> 00:22:45,947
we didn't talk about logistics,
with my new hours,

492
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,993
how that might affect the kids
or how you feel about it.

493
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:51,213
Whatever we got to do,
we're gonna do, okay?

494
00:22:51,297 --> 00:22:54,346
- I know. But...
- No. There's no buts.

495
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:58,525
Yeah, maybe I'm a little
disappointed, but it's fine.

496
00:22:58,609 --> 00:23:02,354
You saw Morgan Edge
as an opportunity

497
00:23:02,438 --> 00:23:04,313
before anybody.

498
00:23:04,397 --> 00:23:07,142
Of course you should be
rewarded for that.

499
00:23:07,226 --> 00:23:09,231
He's an idiot
if he can't see that.

500
00:23:09,315 --> 00:23:12,974
Whoa, whoa, he is not
an idiot, okay?

501
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,933
He promoted you,
after all, right?

502
00:23:16,017 --> 00:23:17,674
[chuckles]

503
00:23:17,758 --> 00:23:21,591
Listen, babe, you got to know
I'm real proud of you.

504
00:23:21,675 --> 00:23:24,507
I mean, you are the brains
of this family, after all.

505
00:23:24,591 --> 00:23:26,161
We all know that.

506
00:23:26,245 --> 00:23:29,904
[chuckles]
You deserve to be happy.

507
00:23:29,988 --> 00:23:32,646
- I'm happy.
- Well, good.

508
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,605
Then whatever comes next,

509
00:23:35,689 --> 00:23:38,565
I think we will handle it...

510
00:23:38,649 --> 00:23:41,698
- Mm-hmm.
- Together.

511
00:23:41,782 --> 00:23:44,614
Did you get me desert?

512
00:23:44,698 --> 00:23:47,661
Oh, sweets,
it's way past your bedtime.

513
00:23:47,745 --> 00:23:51,139
- Where is your sister?
- I think she's in her room.

514
00:23:52,358 --> 00:23:54,406
Yeah. Go check.

515
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,495
Come here.

516
00:23:55,579 --> 00:23:58,410
[suspenseful music]

517
00:23:58,494 --> 00:23:59,934
[♪]

518
00:24:00,018 --> 00:24:03,067
No.

519
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:05,505
It's not like Sarah
to just leave.

520
00:24:05,589 --> 00:24:08,116
I'm gonna check
the security cam footage.

521
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,901
For the hundredth time,
I'm fine.

522
00:24:10,985 --> 00:24:12,816
No, you're not.

523
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,426
You just detonated like a bomb

524
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,819
in the middle of a high-school
football game

525
00:24:15,903 --> 00:24:17,342
in front of a crowd
full of people.

526
00:24:17,426 --> 00:24:18,735
I could have controlled it,
all right?

527
00:24:18,819 --> 00:24:20,650
I just let it go
'cause you were there.

528
00:24:20,734 --> 00:24:23,218
Yeah, but what if I wasn't?

529
00:24:23,302 --> 00:24:25,913
Jordan, sit up and look at me.

530
00:24:28,437 --> 00:24:31,879
Do you understand
how dangerous this could be?

531
00:24:31,963 --> 00:24:33,533
Tell me exactly what happened.

532
00:24:33,617 --> 00:24:36,100
Were there... were there
any symptoms, any signs,

533
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:38,494
something that would have made
you think that this was coming?

534
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:39,756
Look, Dad, you're thinking
about this too much.

535
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,976
I just... I had a moment,
all right?

536
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:46,023
- Jordan...
- that's not 100% true.

537
00:24:46,107 --> 00:24:47,372
- Jon.
- What?

538
00:24:47,456 --> 00:24:49,070
Jordan, he needs to know.

539
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,073
Look, the first time that he
had one of these episodes

540
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,031
or whatever,
I mean, it stopped.

541
00:24:54,115 --> 00:24:56,381
It seemed fine.

542
00:24:56,465 --> 00:24:59,036
- The first time?
- I had a migraine at school.

543
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,430
- It wasn't a big deal.
- And you didn't tell me?

544
00:25:01,514 --> 00:25:03,650
I didn't tell you
'cause I knew you'd overreact.

545
00:25:03,734 --> 00:25:05,086
I knew you'd stop me
from playing the game.

546
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,653
- Yeah!
- And I would have been right!

547
00:25:06,737 --> 00:25:07,958
So I'm just supposed
to be punished

548
00:25:08,042 --> 00:25:10,004
for something
that isn't my fault?

549
00:25:10,088 --> 00:25:11,875
This was my shot, Dad.

550
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:16,227
This was my chance to show the
d-bags at Metropolis who I am.

551
00:25:16,311 --> 00:25:19,013
You remember
how they treated me, right?

552
00:25:19,097 --> 00:25:21,276
Jordan, I know. I know.
And I get it, okay?

553
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,060
I know what it's like
to be picked on.

554
00:25:23,144 --> 00:25:25,759
Yeah, but you get to grow up,
and you get to be Superman.

555
00:25:25,843 --> 00:25:28,283
Who am I?

556
00:25:28,367 --> 00:25:31,109
I'm a weird kid with headaches.

557
00:25:32,719 --> 00:25:36,683
I just... I wanted to be good
at something... that was all.

558
00:25:36,767 --> 00:25:39,207
That's not what
your powers are for. Jordan...

559
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:43,428
Dad, I'm not you, okay?

560
00:25:43,512 --> 00:25:46,515
[sighs]

561
00:25:49,562 --> 00:25:51,523
[cell phone ringing]

562
00:25:51,607 --> 00:25:53,569
Hey, Lana, sorry.
Can I... can I call you back?

563
00:25:53,653 --> 00:25:56,224
Clark, real quick...
Did Sarah come to the game?

564
00:25:56,308 --> 00:26:00,054
- Uh... no, I didn't see her.
- Why? Is everything okay?

565
00:26:00,138 --> 00:26:02,143
Well, she was supposed
to be here with Sophie,

566
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,927
and she's not.

567
00:26:04,011 --> 00:26:05,494
I knew she'd canceled plans
about coming to the game.

568
00:26:05,578 --> 00:26:07,148
I just thought...

569
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,977
- Is that that Harris kid?
- Oh, my God, yeah it is.

570
00:26:10,061 --> 00:26:12,719
Clark, I got to go.
[line clicks]

571
00:26:12,803 --> 00:26:14,677
- What was that?
- Stay here.

572
00:26:14,761 --> 00:26:17,549
- Everything okay?
- Stay here.

573
00:26:17,633 --> 00:26:19,116
You sure about this?

574
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,553
No point playing it cautious
now, right?

575
00:26:21,637 --> 00:26:23,120
And you know
what to look for?

576
00:26:23,204 --> 00:26:25,732
Yeah. Got my hands
on some schematics.

577
00:26:25,816 --> 00:26:28,865
What we want is just up ahead.

578
00:26:28,949 --> 00:26:33,130
And how, may I ask, did you
manage to just take a peak

579
00:26:33,214 --> 00:26:36,307
at Edge EnerCorp's
top secret schematics?

580
00:26:36,391 --> 00:26:38,745
Uh, friend of mine helped out

581
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:41,138
with some surgically
precise hacking.

582
00:26:41,222 --> 00:26:43,184
Well, points to you
and your friend.

583
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,752
And the grand prize is...

584
00:26:45,836 --> 00:26:48,490
- Should be right here.
- Yeah.

585
00:26:52,581 --> 00:26:54,714
You came prepared.

586
00:27:00,676 --> 00:27:02,896
[distant siren wailing]

587
00:27:17,389 --> 00:27:21,396
Tag, what the hell?
Where are we?

588
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,617
It's okay.
We're in Metropolis.

589
00:27:25,701 --> 00:27:28,795
How are we in Metropolis?

590
00:27:28,879 --> 00:27:30,971
That's the thing, Sarah.

591
00:27:31,055 --> 00:27:34,148
I can move pretty fast now.

592
00:27:34,232 --> 00:27:36,933

594
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:44,201
So a high-tech gadget guy
works for LuthorCorps,

595
00:27:44,285 --> 00:27:46,116
the top tech company
in the world,

596
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,817
only to quit and pursue
a career in journalism.

597
00:27:50,901 --> 00:27:52,819
Did I get that right?

598
00:27:52,903 --> 00:27:55,775
Feels like I should be focusing
my story on you.

599
00:28:03,174 --> 00:28:05,005
No, the, uh...

600
00:28:05,089 --> 00:28:08,225
story...

601
00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:10,314
is on what's in these walls.

602
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:11,620
What is that?

603
00:28:11,704 --> 00:28:15,711
X-K, otherwise known
as X-Kryptonite.

604
00:28:15,795 --> 00:28:17,408
X-Kryptonite?

605
00:28:17,492 --> 00:28:19,454
Rarest form of Kryptonite.

606
00:28:19,538 --> 00:28:21,586
And if my hunch is right,

607
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,851
these mines have the largest
supply of it anywhere.

608
00:28:24,935 --> 00:28:26,504
There's your story, Miss Lane.

609
00:28:26,588 --> 00:28:28,506
Too bad no one's
gonna read it.

610

[suspenseful music]

611
00:28:36,511 --> 00:28:38,255
Still scanning Metropolis,
General.

612

Find this kid now.

[indistinct chatter on TV]

614
00:28:44,606 --> 00:28:46,568
Nothing about Dad
on the news.

615
00:28:46,652 --> 00:28:49,176
Can't find anything
on the Internet either.

616
00:28:52,092 --> 00:28:55,008
Jordan you're n... you're not,
like, mad at me, are you?

617
00:28:56,967 --> 00:28:59,059
Nah.

618
00:28:59,143 --> 00:29:01,713
I'm just a little tired
of being told what to do.

619
00:29:01,797 --> 00:29:03,280
That's all.

620
00:29:03,364 --> 00:29:04,934
- [scoffs] Yeah.
- [person cheering]

- Oh, it's the boys.

00:29:11,329 --> 00:29:14,814
Ha! What's good, Mike?
What's good? What's good?

624
00:29:14,898 --> 00:29:16,163
How you feeling, rock star?
Better?

625
00:29:16,247 --> 00:29:18,905
I'm all right.
Yeah. Yeah.

626
00:29:18,989 --> 00:29:21,255
- Good. Let's go.
- Going where?

627
00:29:21,339 --> 00:29:23,170
To pay some millennial
to get us a few sixers

628
00:29:23,254 --> 00:29:25,476
so we can celebrate properly.

629
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,261
That'd be... that'd be
tight, guys.

630
00:29:27,345 --> 00:29:30,307
But, honestly, my pops said
we got to stay here, so...

631
00:29:30,391 --> 00:29:31,352
- Oh, come on!
- He did.

632
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,832
All right.

633
00:29:32,916 --> 00:29:34,224
It's not like
we're going clubbing.

634
00:29:34,308 --> 00:29:36,920
Liquor store's
just up the street.

635

You know what?
We won a big game.

00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:43,103
Come on. Let's go.
Come on.

637
00:29:43,187 --> 00:29:45,319

00:29:48,844 --> 00:29:50,542
Yeah. All right.

Be ready to move.

I'm sorry about your head.
It's because of my power.

- It's hard to control.
- Tag, slow down.

651

on camera.

All I want is to just show you.

It's coming from Jordan.

something.

It's crazy, Sarah,
but it's true.

00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,563
I had to tell someone I trust,
you know?

Plus, you know him...

659
00:30:56,347 --> 00:31:00,180
and I wondered
if he told you something.

660
00:31:00,264 --> 00:31:02,051
Maybe you can help me.

661
00:31:02,135 --> 00:31:05,359
I don't know anything.

662
00:31:05,443 --> 00:31:08,188
Don't run.

You got. You got it.

Jo-Jo,

Yo, Cutter.

over now, huh?

So what?

00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:42,309
You came here to talk

Wow.

You, uh, juicing

I give you my word...

I will make sure
that you are safe

- We will fire!

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,977
No! Don't!

703
00:32:42,061 --> 00:32:44,240
- Tag, stop.
- Engage.

00:32:44,324 --> 00:32:47,035
You can't do this.
You can't do this.

you might try

You saw what I saw.

That's your story.

00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,475
You are armed to the teeth
with the kind of weapons

743
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:15,043

on the FBI's Most Wanted List.

00:35:15,127 --> 00:35:17,480
And this security badge... I sent
a photo to a friend of mine,

that you came to write a story.

I'm really here.

00:36:01,391 --> 00:36:03,309

- Okay, but you did.

You... you did, Jordan.

765
00:36:17,232 --> 00:36:18,628

- Right?

to do with it.

come with responsibility,

But your dad is right.

Yeah, I know.
I know they're different.

Do you?

787
00:37:05,106 --> 00:37:07,503
Because you made a big point
at the hotel

788
00:37:07,587 --> 00:37:08,983
of saying you're different
from me.

789
00:37:09,067 --> 00:37:10,941
But you're not.

790
00:37:11,025 --> 00:37:13,683
That anger you felt that made
you want to use your powers

791
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:17,380

I have those feelings, too.

792
00:37:20,121 --> 00:37:22,736
- You do?
- Yes.

793
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,738
But I keep them in check.

794
00:37:24,822 --> 00:37:27,218
Otherwise, I risk losing
the trust of the very people

795
00:37:27,302 --> 00:37:29,351
I've sworn to protect.

796
00:37:29,435 --> 00:37:31,701
When I first showed up
in Metropolis as Superman,

797
00:37:31,785 --> 00:37:33,790
there was a lot of talk
about what the world should do

798
00:37:33,874 --> 00:37:36,010
with someone
who had powers like mine.

799
00:37:36,094 --> 00:37:38,229
And it took me a minute
to realize that other people

800
00:37:38,313 --> 00:37:41,145
were more afraid
of what I could do than I was.

801
00:37:41,229 --> 00:37:42,799
So what I had to do,

802
00:37:42,883 --> 00:37:45,454
more than anything,
was earn their trust,

803
00:37:45,538 --> 00:37:47,500
prove to them that,
no matter what,

804
00:37:47,584 --> 00:37:50,067
I would never use my powers
to hurt them.

805
00:37:50,151 --> 00:37:52,983
20 years later,
every time I use my powers,

806
00:37:53,067 --> 00:37:55,246
that trust is tested,

807
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:57,376
every time.

808
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:00,945
Just today, in fact.

809
00:38:03,513 --> 00:38:05,822
The thing about trust,
Jordan...

810
00:38:05,906 --> 00:38:07,607
Once you break it,

811
00:38:07,691 --> 00:38:11,001
it's take a lot longer
to heal than a wrist.

812
00:38:11,085 --> 00:38:14,048
It's late.
Go get some sleep.

813

this more tomorrow.

He's so young.
He's not ready for this.

818
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:34,979
I know.
Neither was I, but...

819
00:38:37,938 --> 00:38:39,639
Probably not the best time
to tell you

820
00:38:39,723 --> 00:38:41,815
I almost got killed tonight.

821
00:38:41,899 --> 00:38:43,773
- What?
- I got into the mine,

822
00:38:43,857 --> 00:38:46,515
with the help of this supposed
journalist, Marcus Bridgewater,

823
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,604
and he led me to something
called X-Kryptonite.

824
00:38:48,688 --> 00:38:51,259
- Have you ever heard of that?
- X-Kry... No. No. Wait. Back up.

825
00:38:51,343 --> 00:38:53,043
What do you mean
you almost got killed?

826
00:38:53,127 --> 00:38:56,482
- Leslie Larr came after us.
- Turns out she has powers, too.

827
00:38:56,566 --> 00:38:58,832
She tried to heat vision us,
and then Marcus zapped her

828
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:01,356
with this,
like, high-tech ray gun.

829
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,314
Why? Why does a journalist
have a ray gun?

830
00:39:03,398 --> 00:39:06,492
- That makes no sense.
- He's no journalist.

831
00:39:06,576 --> 00:39:09,970
I need to figure out who he is
and what he has on Morgan Edge.

832
00:39:17,587 --> 00:39:19,983
Sarah, are you okay?

833
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:23,378
It's just crazy.

834
00:39:23,462 --> 00:39:25,293
I've known Tag my entire life,

or whatever.

836
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,518
I was really scared.

837
00:39:32,602 --> 00:39:36,522
But I knew
that he would never hurt me.

838
00:39:36,606 --> 00:39:39,916
He was just
really confused, and...

839
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,221
he was really
focused on you.

840
00:39:44,962 --> 00:39:49,578
He showed me this video
from the night of the bonfire.

841
00:39:49,662 --> 00:39:53,060
He had this whole theory
that whatever happened,

842
00:39:53,144 --> 00:39:57,151
whatever gave him his powers...

843
00:39:57,235 --> 00:39:59,454

Even if there was something,

848
00:40:17,472 --> 00:40:20,261
you could tell me, right?

849
00:40:20,345 --> 00:40:22,434
Yeah, of course.

850
00:40:25,045 --> 00:40:27,007
Okay.

00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,400
- How are you doing?

852
00:40:29,484 --> 00:40:33,013
I just keep thinking
about what could have happened.

853
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,190
Sarah told me that Tag...

854
00:40:36,274 --> 00:40:38,845
has these special abilities.

855
00:40:38,929 --> 00:40:40,499
He's not sure how he got them,

856
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:44,720
but clearly this has something
to do with those mines.

857
00:40:44,804 --> 00:40:47,590
Lois, what aren't
you telling me?

858
00:40:49,069 --> 00:40:51,858
I haven't put it
all together yet.

859
00:40:51,942 --> 00:40:55,470
But, yes, it does involve Tag
and two other people,

860
00:40:55,554 --> 00:40:59,213
both of whom have been linkedto Edge.

861
00:40:59,297 --> 00:41:02,822
He's up to something.
I just don't know exactly what.

862
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:06,046
I could help you figure out
if, in fact,

863
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,788
he was up to something
dangerous or illegal.

864
00:41:08,872 --> 00:41:10,616
Are you sure
you want to do that?

865
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,400
He is very dangerous.

866
00:41:12,484 --> 00:41:16,360
Look, if it's gonna keep him
from hurting other people, yes,

867
00:41:16,444 --> 00:41:17,884
I'm in.

868
00:41:17,968 --> 00:41:20,669
- And Kyle's okay with this?
- No. No.

869
00:41:20,753 --> 00:41:24,061
It's just best to keep this
between us for now.

870
00:41:25,323 --> 00:41:26,716
Okay.

871
00:41:32,243 --> 00:41:35,031
I happen to know that we have

872
00:41:35,115 --> 00:41:37,251
a ton of rocky road
in the freezer,

873
00:41:37,335 --> 00:41:40,167
and I can't handle it
all by myself.

874
00:41:40,251 --> 00:41:41,687
You think I'm six?

875
00:41:43,341 --> 00:41:45,476
No.

876
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,915
But I will say that I have,
as recently as this morning,

877
00:41:48,999 --> 00:41:52,002
kind of wished that you were.

878
00:41:54,091 --> 00:41:57,488
I don't know how to fix this.

879
00:41:57,572 --> 00:42:00,750
I don't know what to do.

880
00:42:03,361 --> 00:42:05,496
I hurt Jon...

881
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:06,669
bad.

882
00:42:10,847 --> 00:42:13,153
I can still hear
his bones snapping.

883
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:17,683
He's my brother,
and I did that to him.

884
00:42:17,767 --> 00:42:20,686
- It was an accident.
- And Tag?

885
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:22,470
That was
an accident, too, right?

886
00:42:22,554 --> 00:42:24,037
It's not your fault.

887
00:42:24,121 --> 00:42:25,865
Mom, I just had to look Sarah
in the eye,

888
00:42:25,949 --> 00:42:27,388
and all she wanted
was the truth,

889
00:42:27,472 --> 00:42:30,086
and I just had to lie
to her...

890
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:32,782
to the one friend
I even have.

891
00:42:35,349 --> 00:42:37,656
You know, I-I think...

892
00:42:39,614 --> 00:42:42,229
I think some stupid part of me
actually thought

893
00:42:42,313 --> 00:42:44,100
that the powers would bring me
closer to people,

894
00:42:44,184 --> 00:42:46,578
but all they really do
is bring me farther away.

895
00:42:50,625 --> 00:42:52,369
Come here, kid.

896
00:42:52,453 --> 00:42:54,633
[crying]

897
00:42:54,717 --> 00:42:57,548
I just want it to end.

898
00:42:57,632 --> 00:43:00,595
- I know.
- [continues crying]

899
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:04,207
[high-pitched ringing]

900
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:06,296
Jordan. Jordan.

901
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,472
Clark! Clark!

902
00:43:08,556 --> 00:43:10,692
[Jordan grunting]

903
00:43:10,776 --> 00:43:12,825
Jordan. Jordan.

904
00:43:12,909 --> 00:43:15,654
[grunting]

905
00:43:15,738 --> 00:43:18,569
I have to get him
to the fortress.

906
00:43:18,653 --> 00:43:21,572
[dramatic music]

907
00:43:21,656 --> 00:43:28,707
[♪]

908
00:43:51,861 --> 00:43:54,864
Greg, move your head.
