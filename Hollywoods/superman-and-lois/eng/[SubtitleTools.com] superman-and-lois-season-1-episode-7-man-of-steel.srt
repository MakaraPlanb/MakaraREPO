1
00:00:01,479 --> 00:00:03,090
Previously on
"Superman & Lois"...

2
00:00:03,133 --> 00:00:05,396
Let's just focus on
what we came here for: family.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,094
The Smallville team needs
a strong leader,

4
00:00:07,268 --> 00:00:08,747
and I'd like to fill that role
with you, Lana.

5
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:10,880
Something sinister
is going on here.

6
00:00:10,923 --> 00:00:13,143
Edge is giving people
Kryptonian powers

7
00:00:13,187 --> 00:00:16,451
at the same time
some armored lunatic arrives

8
00:00:16,494 --> 00:00:17,800
who knows Superman's real name?

9
00:00:17,843 --> 00:00:19,454
We need to stop Kal
-El

10
00:00:19,497 --> 00:00:21,064
before he does to this world
what he did to mine.

11
00:00:21,108 --> 00:00:22,892
Your abilities are evolving.

12
00:00:22,935 --> 00:00:24,111
You can heal faster,
but you can still get hurt.

13
00:00:24,154 --> 00:00:25,242
Clark!

14
00:00:25,286 --> 00:00:27,375
I hid in the Fortress.

15
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:50,006
The quiet
in here should help.

16
00:01:01,931 --> 00:01:03,454
I think Jordan's hearing
kicked in.

17
00:01:03,498 --> 00:01:06,022
Yes, his mechanosensations

18
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,111
have become
significantly enhanced.

19
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:10,287
How do we stop the pain?

20
00:01:10,331 --> 00:01:11,897
His auditory perception

21
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:14,378
is causing
an allodynic response.

22
00:01:14,422 --> 00:01:16,511
Until he can control
what he hears,

23
00:01:16,554 --> 00:01:19,340
every sound
will be accompanied by pain.

24
00:01:19,383 --> 00:01:21,124
I have to help him.

25
00:01:21,168 --> 00:01:23,213
Teach him how to focus,
share what you know,

26
00:01:23,257 --> 00:01:26,912
but it will take much practice
on his part,

27
00:01:26,956 --> 00:01:29,089
the same as it did for you,
Kal-El.

28
00:01:47,542 --> 00:01:50,240
How long till
the super hearing levels out?

29
00:01:50,284 --> 00:01:53,156
My father said
he has to adapt on his own.

30
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,723
How long were you
out of commission for?

31
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:56,464
A couple weeks.
- So now, let me guess.

32
00:01:56,507 --> 00:01:58,292
I have to come up
with another BS excuse

33
00:01:58,335 --> 00:02:00,120
as to why
he's not going to school?

34
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:01,599
I'll call Principal Balcomb

35
00:02:01,643 --> 00:02:02,905
first thing in the morning,
okay?

36
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,474
You two should get to bed.

37
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,043
Jordan.

38
00:02:15,874 --> 00:02:17,702
We'll work on this tomorrow.

39
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,589
Hey, hey.

40
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:42,901
He was in so much pain.

41
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:44,555
I know, I know.

42
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:48,559
Once it settles in,
he'll be fine.

43
00:02:48,603 --> 00:02:50,387
Promise.

44
00:03:03,574 --> 00:03:06,229
Listen, I know
we already went over this,

45
00:03:06,273 --> 00:03:08,492
but is there anything
in particular

46
00:03:08,536 --> 00:03:10,233
I should be looking out for?

47
00:03:10,277 --> 00:03:11,974
If Edge is making
people with powers,

48
00:03:12,017 --> 00:03:13,497
he's not doing it out
in the open,

49
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:17,414
so kind of just anything
out of the ordinary.

50
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:20,374
Buildings, machines,
invoices even.

51
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:22,854
Okay, and is there
a way to tell

52
00:03:22,898 --> 00:03:24,856
if someone already has powers?

53
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,380
Not really,

54
00:03:26,423 --> 00:03:28,120
but we do know
that Leslie Larr has powers,

55
00:03:28,164 --> 00:03:30,558
so it's safe to assume
that other people do too.

56
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:32,255
Lana, I don't want you
doing anything

57
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:35,084
that makes you
feel even remotely unsafe.

58
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:36,607
No, I wanna help.

59
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:38,479
I'll call you
if I find anything.

60
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:40,132
Thanks.
Bye.

61
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,226
Who's this?

62
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:48,140
The real Marcus Bridgewater.

63
00:03:48,184 --> 00:03:50,795
So the guy from the mines--
- Lied.

64
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:53,407
Even tried to cover his tracks
by scrubbing all images

65
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,452
of Marcus Bridgewater
from the Internet.

66
00:03:55,496 --> 00:03:56,845
Luckily,
Maxy still has a friend

67
00:03:56,888 --> 00:03:58,281
at Reuters who had a photo.

68
00:03:58,325 --> 00:03:59,456
So why is he lying
about his identity?

69
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,936
I don't know.
I mean,

70
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:02,677
it probably has
something to do with the fact

71
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,592
that he knows
so much about Edge.

72
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:08,030
So two people working
for Edge have attacked you,

73
00:04:08,073 --> 00:04:09,901
and both have had powers.

74
00:04:09,945 --> 00:04:12,556
Yeah.
I'm sure there are others.

75
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,123
Yeah, which is why I think

76
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,472
we should tell the boys
what's going on.

77
00:04:15,516 --> 00:04:17,126
Well, that's
a pretty big departure

78
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:18,997
from not wanting them to know
anything about Superman.

79
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,391
Well, hindsight, maybe
that wasn't the best choice.

80
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:22,740
This feels different.

81
00:04:22,784 --> 00:04:24,264
The whole point
of moving to Smallville

82
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:25,917
was to give them a shot
at a normal life,

83
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:28,311
not terrify them.
- I know, I know, but--

84
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:30,400
Plus Jordan has the stuff
going on with the hearing,

85
00:04:30,444 --> 00:04:33,664
and Jonathan
hasn't made any friends.

86
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:34,970
It doesn't feel fair
to give them

87
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:36,319
one more thing to worry about.

88
00:04:36,363 --> 00:04:37,886
I think they can handle this.

89
00:04:37,929 --> 00:04:39,366
I still think that
we need to know more

90
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:40,367
about what we're dealing with,

91
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,456
and then we can discuss it.

92
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:45,763
Okay.
Where are you going?

93
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:47,591
To confront
the former Mr. Bridgewater.

94
00:04:47,635 --> 00:04:48,984
Will you stay close by today?

95
00:04:49,027 --> 00:04:50,681
I have a feeling
I'm gonna need your help.

96
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:52,292
Yeah.

97
00:04:53,989 --> 00:04:56,992
Why have you not ID'd
Lane's friend from the mines?

98
00:04:57,035 --> 00:04:58,559
Believe me, I've looked.

99
00:04:58,602 --> 00:05:00,561
We have no matches
from the security footage.

100
00:05:00,604 --> 00:05:01,779
The guy's a ghost.

101
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:05,348
A very well-armed ghost.

102
00:05:05,392 --> 00:05:07,132
Between him, Lane,
and Superman,

103
00:05:07,176 --> 00:05:10,222
how are we supposed to get the
X-Kryptonite out of the mines?

104
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:13,443
Maybe we use that
to our advantage,

105
00:05:13,487 --> 00:05:15,967
send out a small shipment,
see who comes for it.

106
00:05:16,011 --> 00:05:18,405
The intel we get in return
could prove invaluable.

107
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:20,363
A small fragment only.

108
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:23,453
And Leslie, no more failures.

109
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:29,416
Oh, sorry.
I was just about to knock.

110
00:05:33,811 --> 00:05:35,204
Don't mind her.

111
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:36,597
Shall we walk?

112
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:40,992
So you want me to create
what kind of program?

113
00:05:41,036 --> 00:05:42,385
A leadership program.

114
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:44,256
I'm looking
for people with passion

115
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,042
who, like you,
have untapped potential

116
00:05:47,085 --> 00:05:48,913
and are ready
to take that first step.

117
00:05:48,957 --> 00:05:52,395
First step
towards what exactly?

118
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:54,397
Achieving their best selves.

119
00:05:54,441 --> 00:05:55,833
I thought you'd have known that
by now.

120
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:57,922
Okay, and how many candidates

121
00:05:57,966 --> 00:05:59,402
were you looking for?

122
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:01,709
Why don't we start with five
and go from there?

123
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,495
I'm expecting great things
from you, Lana.

124
00:06:17,202 --> 00:06:19,161
You can do this.

125
00:06:19,204 --> 00:06:20,510
It hurts.

126
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:21,642
I know, but you're gonna have

127
00:06:21,685 --> 00:06:23,557
to work through it, okay?

128
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,733
One sound at a time.
Come on.

129
00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:03,858
I can't do it.
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:06,774 --> 00:07:08,471
Jordan.
Jordan.

131
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:10,691
We'll just try it tomorrow
or something.

132
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:13,389
Audio is fully operational.

133
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,347
It's good to be back, sir.

134
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:17,132
You're still only at 30%.

135
00:07:17,175 --> 00:07:19,177
Perhaps you'll consider that
next time

136
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:21,397
before crushing me
to smithereens.

137
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:43,332
Lois Lane.

138
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:46,509
Hello, guy who is
not Marcus Bridgewater.

139
00:07:47,423 --> 00:07:49,425
How about you come inside,
and we talk about it?

140
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,600
Yeah, that's a hard pass

141
00:07:50,644 --> 00:07:52,689
on me entering
your creeper mobile.

142
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:55,387
That's unfair
and pretty hurtful.

143
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,478
Meet me at Victoria May's
in an hour.

144
00:07:58,521 --> 00:07:59,957
And get ready
to tell the truth.

145
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:02,046
Otherwise, this little team-up
of ours is done.

146
00:08:17,018 --> 00:08:18,759
What are you thinking about
this early?

147
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:21,892
Same thing as last night.

148
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:28,420
You are playing with fire.

149
00:08:29,247 --> 00:08:31,598
Ugh, childhood ruined.
Therapy needed.

150
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:32,686
Thanks a lot, Mom and Dad.

151
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:33,861
Hey, Nat
-Bug.

152
00:08:33,904 --> 00:08:35,384
Look, I'm not gonna be tardy

153
00:08:35,427 --> 00:08:36,820
just because you two
can't stop being disgusting.

154
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:38,561
Whoa, it's not disgusting.

155
00:08:38,605 --> 00:08:40,302
No, this is
a loving display of--

156
00:08:40,345 --> 00:08:41,956
Affection.
Yeah, I know.

157
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:43,566
You know why I know?

158
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,785
Because you two are
the most affectionate people

159
00:08:44,828 --> 00:08:45,873
I've ever seen in my life.

160
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:06,328
What's Superman doing?

161
00:09:06,371 --> 00:09:07,764
And who's he with?

162
00:09:27,131 --> 00:09:28,219
Oh, my God.

163
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,742
Yo, Cushing, hey.

164
00:10:55,785 --> 00:10:57,395
Didn't--I didn't see you
at lunch today.

165
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:59,397
Is everything all right?

166
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:00,964
Maybe you should tell me.

167
00:11:01,008 --> 00:11:03,097
Why isn't Jordan
at school today?

168
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,055
Uh, I mean, he's not
really feeling well.

169
00:11:05,577 --> 00:11:06,970
Right.

170
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:08,363
Hey, what--
hold on, hold on, hold on.

171
00:11:08,406 --> 00:11:10,626
What's going on?
- You're lying to me.

172
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,628
About Jordan being sick?

173
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,674
You know what happened
last night with Tag,

174
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:16,327
and you're acting as though
Jordan not coming to school

175
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:17,894
is--kinda weird.

176
00:11:17,938 --> 00:11:20,114
Well, yeah, Sarah, Sarah,
hey, hey, look.

177
00:11:20,157 --> 00:11:22,159
I know what happened
with Tag, okay?

178
00:11:22,203 --> 00:11:23,770
And I'm sorry,
it's really messed up,

179
00:11:23,813 --> 00:11:25,728
but Jordan had nothing
to do with that.

180
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,557
That's not what Tag said.

181
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,211
What?
'Cause of some stupid video?

182
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:31,995
Did you even watch it?

183
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:34,476
Seriously, look, I mean,
there's absolutely no way

184
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:36,391
that Jordan gave Tag powers
or whatever.

185
00:11:36,434 --> 00:11:37,871
And also, truth be told,

186
00:11:37,914 --> 00:11:39,742
the reason that Jordan's
not at school

187
00:11:39,786 --> 00:11:42,136
is because Tag jumped him
the other day.

188
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:44,268
And it totally messed him up,

189
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:47,141
and now he's having
these terrible headaches.

190
00:11:47,184 --> 00:11:48,925
That's why he had bruises
on his face.

191
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,885
Why didn't he just tell me?
- I don't know.

192
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:53,582
I guess he didn't want you
to worry.

193
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:57,847
See?
He's not such a bad guy.

194
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:58,848
Yeah.

195
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:00,763
And also,

196
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:02,330
yeah, I broke my wrist.

197
00:12:02,373 --> 00:12:03,940
Thanks for asking.
It really sucks.

198
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,900
Jonathan.

199
00:12:08,684 --> 00:12:10,468
Jonathan!

200
00:12:14,646 --> 00:12:16,344
I gotta say,
I don't love the idea

201
00:12:16,387 --> 00:12:17,780
of leaving you alone with him.

202
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:20,043
Well, get used to it,
'cause he's here.

203
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:21,610
And what exactly
am I looking for?

204
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:22,916
You'll know it
when you see it.

205
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,700
Here, wish me luck.

206
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,789
Good luck.

207
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:44,328
I ordered you
a trenté green tea

208
00:12:44,372 --> 00:12:45,721
with a splash of almond milk.

209
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:49,812
It's what you got last time.

210
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:51,945
I think it's time
we moved past favorite drinks

211
00:12:51,988 --> 00:12:54,121
and actually got to know
each other.

212
00:12:54,164 --> 00:12:55,252
Absolutely.

213
00:12:55,296 --> 00:12:56,819
Great.
I'll go first.

214
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:57,994
You've been lying to me
ever since we first met.

215
00:12:58,038 --> 00:12:59,169
You're wrong about that.

216
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:00,823
I mean, obviously

217
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:02,912
not the name part,

218
00:13:02,956 --> 00:13:04,348
but everything else is true.

219
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:05,697
Then who are you?

220
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:07,090
It's complicated.

221
00:13:07,134 --> 00:13:08,918
Then you better start
boiling it down.

222
00:13:14,576 --> 00:13:16,273
Welcome back, Captain.

223
00:13:16,317 --> 00:13:18,580
How was your conversation
with Lois Lane?

224
00:13:22,627 --> 00:13:24,064
Captain Luthor?

225
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:28,895
Telling you who I am
will only confuse things.

226
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:30,200
What's important
is you understand

227
00:13:30,244 --> 00:13:31,636
what Edge is really planning.

228
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,029
I know he's making people
with powers.

229
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:34,683
Not people.
An army.

230
00:13:34,726 --> 00:13:37,164
An army to do what?
- Take over the world.

231
00:13:37,207 --> 00:13:39,122
Metropolis will be
the first city to fall.

232
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,950
You seem awfully sureof that.

233
00:13:40,994 --> 00:13:42,212
Because it's the truth.

234
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:43,866
And why should I believe you?

235
00:13:53,136 --> 00:13:54,790
Hey.

236
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,183
Okay, so I have
a contact in shipping

237
00:13:56,226 --> 00:13:57,619
at Edge's mines--

238
00:13:57,662 --> 00:13:59,229
Well, I mean,
not really a contact,

239
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:00,840
more like an ex
who really never got over me.

240
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:02,319
Chrissy.

241
00:14:02,363 --> 00:14:03,799
Edge is about
to send a shipment out.

242
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,019
Do you think
it's X-Kryptonite?

243
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:09,022
Only one way to find out.
Thanks, boss.

244
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:11,285
We'll have to pick this up
some other time.

245
00:14:11,328 --> 00:14:12,764
Something came up.

246
00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:14,070
Lois, this is serious.

247
00:14:14,114 --> 00:14:15,376
I need to speak with Superman.

248
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:16,377
Maybe when we're on

249
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,857
a first-name basis.

250
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:28,824
Well, that was fast.

251
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,087
Chrissy called.
Looks like Edge is on the move.

252
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:32,610
Any luck with the RV?

253
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:34,612
You were right about knowing it
when I found it.

254
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:37,006
It seems we have a problem.

255
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,791
Lois will come around.

256
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:42,055
I was referring
to the intruder.

257
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:45,188
Intruder?
In here?

258
00:14:45,232 --> 00:14:47,147
Yes, Captain.
I managed to capture

259
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,931
an image
in front of the monitors.

260
00:14:51,238 --> 00:14:53,283
That's her husband.

261
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:54,763
Is he a threat?

262
00:14:54,806 --> 00:14:56,721
No.
He's not important.

263
00:14:56,765 --> 00:14:59,376
There's also been
a development at the mines.

264
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,944
Satellite imaging is showing
increased activity.

265
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:03,815
That's what her call
was about.

266
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:06,557
Pull it up.

267
00:15:14,783 --> 00:15:16,393
Emily.

268
00:15:16,437 --> 00:15:18,874
Hi.
Take a seat.

269
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,658
What are you doing here?

270
00:15:20,702 --> 00:15:22,878
Well, um,
I was just told

271
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,358
that you were the one
I'm supposed to talk to

272
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:27,013
about the Young
Executive Program.

273
00:15:27,056 --> 00:15:28,362
Yes.

274
00:15:28,405 --> 00:15:30,364
Yeah,
I'm actually just starting

275
00:15:30,407 --> 00:15:31,974
to get into all that now.

276
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:33,889
Well, listen, I, uh, I know

277
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,586
I've been out of the workforce
for a while,

278
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,675
but you know,
we couldn't afford childcare,

279
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:39,634
and now that Avery's
in high school--

280
00:15:39,677 --> 00:15:41,114
Oh, no, no, no.

281
00:15:41,157 --> 00:15:42,680
You do not need to defend
being a mother to me.

282
00:15:42,724 --> 00:15:45,988
Good, because
I really want this, Lana.

283
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:48,599
This is a chance for me to make
a better life for my family,

284
00:15:48,643 --> 00:15:49,992
just like what you're doing.

285
00:15:50,036 --> 00:15:51,776
There are tradeoffs.

286
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,083
I mean, there are things
you might not be aware of.

287
00:15:54,127 --> 00:15:56,738
Oh, you don't have to pretend
like this job isn't a big deal.

288
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:58,609
It's obvious.

289
00:15:58,653 --> 00:16:02,135
I'm just, um, asking for
someone to take a chance on me

290
00:16:02,178 --> 00:16:05,007
like they did with you.

291
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:06,617
I appreciate that.

292
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:13,973
Let me see what I can do,

293
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:15,496
but no promises.

294
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:17,846
Thank you, Lana.
Thank you so much.

295
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:19,891
Of course.

296
00:16:22,285 --> 00:16:23,852
Nice to see you.

297
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:25,462
Good to see you.

298
00:16:25,506 --> 00:16:27,203
Bye.

299
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:32,121
Could he actually be
Lex Luthor?

300
00:16:32,165 --> 00:16:34,036
I don't know,
but with everything we know

301
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,125
about the multiverse now,
I'd say anything's possible.

302
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:37,648
Like what?

303
00:16:37,692 --> 00:16:39,955
He's related to Lex somehow?

304
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,478
Maybe a son
we don't know about?

305
00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:42,914
Well, he said
he worked for LuthorCorps.

306
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,351
That can't just be
a coincidence.

307
00:16:44,394 --> 00:16:45,830
Yeah.

308
00:16:45,874 --> 00:16:47,310
And Lex wouldn't be
the first public figure

309
00:16:47,354 --> 00:16:49,051
trying to keep his family
hidden from the world.

310
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:50,226
I'll have Chrissy
look into it.

311
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,098
Are they still up ahead?

312
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:54,622
Yeah.
About two miles up.

313
00:16:54,665 --> 00:16:57,016
It looks like
they've got an escort.

314
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,887
There's a panel van with
four guys with guns inside

315
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,584
a couple cars back.

316
00:17:00,628 --> 00:17:02,282
That seems on brand for Edge.

317
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:04,197
What do you wanna do?
- Just keep following.

318
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,851
I wanna see where they're
taking the X-Kryptonite.

319
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:09,724
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

320
00:17:11,726 --> 00:17:13,467
What is it?

321
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,990
I'm definitely starting
to think

322
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,731
your new friend is a Luthor.

323
00:17:26,741 --> 00:17:28,525
Hey, guys, we got someone
in the road up here.

324
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:29,874
Be ready.

325
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:33,835
Locked and loaded, boys.
It's go time.

326
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:39,449
Things are gonna get
ugly if I don't do something.

327
00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:53,333
Out of the truck!
Get out of the truck!

328
00:17:55,161 --> 00:17:56,945
Turn around.
Get on your knees.

329
00:18:02,037 --> 00:18:04,692
What the hell?

330
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,047
We have a problem.

331
00:18:16,225 --> 00:18:17,313
Don't move.

332
00:18:30,848 --> 00:18:32,807
What are you doing?

333
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,287
I assume the same thing
you are.

334
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:39,161
No, we were following
the truck

335
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:40,989
hoping to find out
where it was headed,

336
00:18:41,032 --> 00:18:42,382
which, now, we'll never know

337
00:18:42,425 --> 00:18:45,036
since you decided
to go full-on Rambo!

338
00:18:48,388 --> 00:18:50,172
I couldn't risk letting this
get where it was going.

339
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:52,566
'Cause that's what Edge
is gonna use to build his army?

340
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:53,697
So you believe me now?

341
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:55,569
Enough games.

342
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:58,049
Tell us what you know.

343
00:18:58,093 --> 00:19:00,356
Fine.
Follow me.

344
00:19:08,103 --> 00:19:09,757
You sure showed that locker.

345
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,106
Yeah, yeah.

346
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,064
Had it coming.

347
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:16,372
Uh, hi.

348
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:19,201
If the zipper gets stuck,
maybe you should try

349
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:21,116
talking to it first.

350
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,163
Nothing good
ever comes from anger.

351
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:25,860
Right, yeah, yeah,
sure, yeah.

352
00:19:25,903 --> 00:19:27,818
I mean, I'm-
-I'm--

353
00:19:27,862 --> 00:19:29,603
I'm not gonna, like, talk
to my backpack.

354
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:31,344
That's--that's weird.

355
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:33,041
Right.

356
00:19:33,084 --> 00:19:35,304
I'll see you around, new guy.

357
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:40,179
No, no, no, no, no.

358
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:43,094
Jonathan, no.
Not Tegan Wickhem.

359
00:19:43,138 --> 00:19:44,792
She's way out of your league.

360
00:19:44,835 --> 00:19:47,055
That's a bit presumptuous,

361
00:19:47,098 --> 00:19:49,797
and besides, how do you know
what my league is?

362
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,016
I know it's not her.

363
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,847
Look, I came over here
to apologize.

364
00:19:56,891 --> 00:19:58,458
I didn't mean
to accuse you of lying

365
00:19:58,501 --> 00:20:01,025
or Jordan of...

366
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:02,549
I don't know.

367
00:20:02,592 --> 00:20:04,333
That's--it's cool.

368
00:20:04,377 --> 00:20:05,421
No, it's not.

369
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:07,162
I'm really worried about Tag.

370
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,946
He's my friend,

371
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,426
and you and Jordan
are the only people

372
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,689
who know
what really happened, so...

373
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:16,302
Yeah, I know, it's a lot
keeping a secret like that.

374
00:20:16,345 --> 00:20:18,042
I know.

375
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,304
Not being the only one
who knows about this helps.

376
00:21:02,348 --> 00:21:04,654
I guess I'm pretty lucky
to have you.

377
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:06,569
I guess I've been in
Smallville long enough to know

378
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:08,832
that you're different
than everyone else.

379
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:11,661
Really?
How so?

380
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:13,402
Mm.

381
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:16,666
I don't know, just--
just, like, more real I guess.

382
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,625
I can tell you hold
a lot of stuff inside,

383
00:21:18,668 --> 00:21:22,106
and I get that.
I get how hard that can be,

384
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,457
so I guess--
I guess what I'm saying is

385
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,242
if you ever need someone
to share that with,

386
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,244
I'm always here.

387
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,333
Wow, you're kind of in a
better league than I thought.

388
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,657
If Edge is using
X-Kryptonite to build an army,

389
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,616
why would he send
such a small shipment?

390
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,488
Probably wanted to see
who'd come for it.

391
00:21:55,531 --> 00:21:58,404
Well, now that he knows,
what's his next move?

392
00:21:58,447 --> 00:22:00,406
It's hard to say,
but we need to be ready.

393
00:22:00,449 --> 00:22:01,842
Ready how?

394
00:22:01,885 --> 00:22:03,017
It's what I was trying
to tell you earlier.

395
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,062
You wanna meet Superman.

396
00:22:05,106 --> 00:22:06,977
It's the only way
to stop this.

397
00:22:07,021 --> 00:22:09,110
Dad, wake up!
Dad!

398
00:22:09,153 --> 00:22:10,720
Dad, wake up.
Dad.

399
00:22:10,764 --> 00:22:11,982
Hmm?
Hmm?

400
00:22:12,026 --> 00:22:14,376
Hey, where's your mom?

401
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:18,641
Coming to you live
from Downtown Metropolis,

402
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:20,643
reporting on the scene
is Lois Lane.

403
00:22:21,862 --> 00:22:23,342
You want answers?

404
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:24,952
I'm willing to tell
Superman everything.

405
00:22:24,995 --> 00:22:26,345
I'm not in the habit

406
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:27,911
of just connecting him
with people.

407
00:22:27,955 --> 00:22:29,348
I'm thinking
the possible end of the world

408
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:31,785
might warrant an exception.
- Okay.

409
00:22:31,828 --> 00:22:35,484
But I want something from you.
That.

410
00:22:36,572 --> 00:22:38,922
The Kryptonians want you to
think they're indestructible.

411
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:40,881
They're not.
They have a weakness.

412
00:22:40,924 --> 00:22:43,492
It is a rock from their home
planet called Kryptonite.

413
00:22:43,536 --> 00:22:46,147
Find it
so that we can defeat them.

414
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,714
I told her not to do this.

415
00:22:47,757 --> 00:22:48,889
And we must defeat them

416
00:22:48,932 --> 00:22:50,978
if we are to save humanity.

417
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:54,111
For that is what separates us
from them:

418
00:22:54,155 --> 00:22:56,287
our humanity.

419
00:22:56,331 --> 00:22:57,550
Mom!

420
00:23:00,466 --> 00:23:01,684
Okay.

421
00:23:04,078 --> 00:23:06,210
But I need to know
one thing first.

422
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,953
Do you trust him?

423
00:23:12,303 --> 00:23:14,131
With my life.

424
00:23:15,785 --> 00:23:18,266
I love you both.

425
00:23:28,581 --> 00:23:30,191
I thought you'd say that.

426
00:23:33,237 --> 00:23:35,239
Set up the meet.

427
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,601
All right,
I'm gonna meet Chrissy,

428
00:23:48,644 --> 00:23:50,385
see if I can establish
any connection

429
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,778
between our guy and Lex.

430
00:23:51,821 --> 00:23:54,302
Yeah, I guess it's still
our only lead.

431
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:56,043
Maybe not.
You said the voice in the RV

432
00:23:56,086 --> 00:23:57,087
called him Captain.

433
00:23:57,131 --> 00:23:58,785
Right, so he's military.

434
00:23:58,828 --> 00:24:00,221
Which is why I want you
to take that

435
00:24:00,264 --> 00:24:01,570
to the DOD for processing.

436
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:04,878
What?

437
00:24:04,921 --> 00:24:07,271
Nothing.
Just, it has his prints.

438
00:24:07,315 --> 00:24:09,143
You know,
you're really good at this.

439
00:24:09,186 --> 00:24:10,753
You better get moving,
Superman.

440
00:24:10,797 --> 00:24:13,234
We don't have much time
before your meeting.

441
00:24:14,191 --> 00:24:15,584
All right.

442
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,993
Do you believe Kal-El
will come?

443
00:24:33,036 --> 00:24:34,211
I do.

444
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:36,910
And we need to be ready.

445
00:26:34,114 --> 00:26:36,595
It's smaller than I imagined.

446
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:38,640
I couldn't have done it
without you, Nat-Bug.

447
00:26:48,084 --> 00:26:50,521
So I can be out there with
you when you're kicking ass.

448
00:26:52,785 --> 00:26:55,222
You really think you could take
one of them out?

449
00:26:56,702 --> 00:26:59,139
Only one way
to know for sure.

450
00:27:18,027 --> 00:27:20,247
Hey.

451
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,640
What were you talking
to Sarah about earlier?

452
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:24,425
What are you--
Are you spying on me?

453
00:27:25,556 --> 00:27:26,645
Wow.

454
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:28,821
Just answer the question.

455
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:30,257
Uh, I was talking to her

456
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,737
like a normal human being.

457
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,129
That's not
what it sounded like.

458
00:27:33,173 --> 00:27:34,870
Are you being serious
right now?

459
00:27:34,914 --> 00:27:36,219
I've been covering your ass
all day,

460
00:27:36,263 --> 00:27:37,960
and now what?

461
00:27:38,004 --> 00:27:40,310
Now you think I'm trying to
move in on your not-girlfriend?

462
00:27:40,354 --> 00:27:43,052
That's not a denial.
- Wow, I have had your back

463
00:27:43,096 --> 00:27:46,577
every time someone
has called you dumb or weird

464
00:27:46,621 --> 00:27:49,102
or stupid or awkward.

465
00:27:49,145 --> 00:27:51,278
I never believed any of it!

466
00:27:51,321 --> 00:27:53,628
I never believed any of it
because it's not true.

467
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,761
You're just a terrible person!

468
00:27:55,804 --> 00:27:57,588
Don't ever spy on me again!

469
00:28:06,206 --> 00:28:07,729
Impressive bunch
you've assembled.

470
00:28:07,773 --> 00:28:09,252
Well, there's no shortage

471
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:10,689
of good people in Smallville.

472
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:13,779
And yet, one spot remains.

473
00:28:13,822 --> 00:28:15,737
One spot.

474
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:18,740
Just getting through
the last of the résumés.

475
00:28:18,784 --> 00:28:20,481
Is that it,

476
00:28:20,524 --> 00:28:22,048
or is there something
you're not telling me?

477
00:28:22,091 --> 00:28:25,268
Um, I don't understand.

478
00:28:25,312 --> 00:28:26,661
I just thought
perhaps you were hoping

479
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,881
I'd select someone
a little closer to home.

480
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:30,273
You mean Kyle.

481
00:28:30,317 --> 00:28:31,971
I believe he'd be
more than interested.

482
00:28:32,014 --> 00:28:33,537
Of course.

483
00:28:33,581 --> 00:28:35,714
But he's the chief
of the fire department.

484
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:38,542
Arrangements could be made.
- Oh, I'm sure,

485
00:28:38,586 --> 00:28:41,241
and it would be
an amazing opportunity,

486
00:28:41,284 --> 00:28:44,026
but it would a lot to juggle
with our girls.

487
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,158
I understand,

488
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:47,508
but we are short on time.

489
00:28:47,551 --> 00:28:49,684
I look forward to hearing
your decision.

490
00:28:51,425 --> 00:28:54,471
Luthor's biographer says
there is no way he has a son.

491
00:28:56,038 --> 00:28:58,214
Maybe a cousin
or distant relative?

492
00:28:58,258 --> 00:29:00,129
She walked me
through every branch

493
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:01,478
of the Luthor family tree.

494
00:29:01,522 --> 00:29:03,654
Our guy is
definitely not on it.

495
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:20,454
Interesting place for a meet.

496
00:29:20,497 --> 00:29:22,238
I'm a builder.

497
00:29:22,282 --> 00:29:24,632
Always felt comfortable
in places like this...

498
00:29:26,242 --> 00:29:28,418
Surrounded by scraps and parts.

499
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:32,031
Building's
a noble profession.

500
00:29:32,074 --> 00:29:34,947
Been a while since
anyone's paid me to do it.

501
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:37,558
Any chance one
of those people was Lex Luthor?

502
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:40,735
It was a different life.

503
00:29:41,431 --> 00:29:42,998
Why are we really here?

504
00:29:44,347 --> 00:29:47,089
Because the world's about to
be destroyed unless I save it.

505
00:29:51,441 --> 00:29:52,921
It's the DOD.

506
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:54,662
Hey, Rosetti, what'd you find?

507
00:29:54,705 --> 00:29:57,230
You say this guy's been
creeping around Smallville?

508
00:29:57,273 --> 00:29:59,710
And how exactly are you
planning on saving the world?

509
00:29:59,754 --> 00:30:01,756
By eliminating the threat.

510
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,932
And you think that threat
is Morgan Edge?

511
00:30:03,976 --> 00:30:05,673
Edge is involved,

512
00:30:05,716 --> 00:30:08,719
but he won't be
the main source of destruction.

513
00:30:08,763 --> 00:30:09,938
Then who will it be?

514
00:30:15,378 --> 00:30:17,076
The thing is,
the prints you had us pull

515
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,773
are from a guy who died
six years ago,

516
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:22,472
and his name's not Luthor,
it's John Henry Irons.

517
00:30:24,561 --> 00:30:26,215
Give me your keys.
I need your car.

518
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,135
You're the Stranger.

519
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,490
I had a feeling
you might try that.

520
00:30:41,535 --> 00:30:43,842
So I set these solar flares

521
00:30:43,885 --> 00:30:45,147
to a motion detector.

522
00:30:45,191 --> 00:30:46,409
Why are you doing this?

523
00:30:46,453 --> 00:30:48,281
Like I said,

524
00:30:48,324 --> 00:30:51,023
I'm here to save the world.

525
00:30:51,066 --> 00:30:53,895
You see, Kal-El,
you're not the Man of Steel.

526
00:30:57,072 --> 00:30:58,552
I am.

527
00:31:12,044 --> 00:31:13,872
That looked like it hurt.

528
00:31:21,314 --> 00:31:25,361
This hammer
harnesses kinetic energy.

529
00:31:25,405 --> 00:31:27,537
The further it travels,

530
00:31:27,581 --> 00:31:29,365
the more energy it creates.

531
00:31:30,366 --> 00:31:34,501
From 20 feet, it can stop
a car in its tracks.

532
00:31:34,544 --> 00:31:36,633
30, a truck.

533
00:31:36,677 --> 00:31:39,941
From 60, it can destroy a tank.

534
00:31:39,985 --> 00:31:41,900
Anything beyond that

535
00:31:41,943 --> 00:31:45,425
rivals a blow from Superman.

536
00:32:00,092 --> 00:32:01,571
Miss Larr?

537
00:32:01,615 --> 00:32:04,313
Superman's gonna be busy
for a while.

538
00:32:04,357 --> 00:32:06,272
Send the shipment.

539
00:32:13,844 --> 00:32:15,411
Is that all you have,
Kal-El?

540
00:32:17,065 --> 00:32:18,806
Hey.
Jordan, Jordan, Jordan, hey.

541
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:20,503
I think someone's trying
to kill Dad.

542
00:32:20,547 --> 00:32:22,244
What?
Where?

543
00:32:22,288 --> 00:32:25,813
Clark, his name
is John Henry Irons!

544
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:28,163
I think he's the Stranger!

545
00:32:28,207 --> 00:32:29,556
Clark!

546
00:32:32,515 --> 00:32:34,039
Okay, you're gonna have
to go faster, all right?

547
00:32:34,082 --> 00:32:35,562
Jordan, I've only driven
Mom's car before!

548
00:32:35,605 --> 00:32:36,911
Please just tell me
which way to go.

549
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,695
It's so loud.

550
00:32:38,739 --> 00:32:40,175
Well, whenever you were
listening to me and Sarah

551
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:41,350
at school earlier,
whenever you heard us,

552
00:32:41,394 --> 00:32:42,612
please do that.Please.

553
00:32:44,266 --> 00:32:46,312
Jordan, please focus.Please.

554
00:32:47,356 --> 00:32:49,010
You're wrong about me.

555
00:32:49,054 --> 00:32:51,012
That way!
That way, that way, that way!

556
00:32:58,889 --> 00:33:01,196
This hero act of yours

557
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,242
is all propaganda,

558
00:33:03,285 --> 00:33:06,245
a way to soften the masses
before you turn on them.

559
00:33:08,203 --> 00:33:10,989
I made a promise
to kill you once.

560
00:33:12,686 --> 00:33:15,080
I wasn't able to keep
that promise on my Earth.

561
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,431
But I will here.

562
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:34,099
Lights...
- What?

563
00:33:34,142 --> 00:33:35,970
The lights.

564
00:34:19,013 --> 00:34:20,406
Stop!

565
00:34:22,408 --> 00:34:24,236
It's over.

566
00:34:24,279 --> 00:34:25,585
It's over.

567
00:34:43,646 --> 00:34:45,605
So this guy came back from
the dead to try and kill you?

568
00:34:45,648 --> 00:34:47,824
Wouldn't be the first time.

569
00:34:47,868 --> 00:34:49,348
Want Trask to take
a run at him?

570
00:34:49,391 --> 00:34:50,523
Try and loosen him up?

571
00:34:50,566 --> 00:34:52,307
Nobody talks to him

572
00:34:52,351 --> 00:34:54,744
until General Lane gets here
in the morning.

573
00:34:54,788 --> 00:34:56,920
And when he does,

574
00:34:56,964 --> 00:34:59,097
I'm going in first.

575
00:35:07,453 --> 00:35:09,977
I'll get it.
- Thanks, sweets.

576
00:35:10,717 --> 00:35:13,111
Hey, Sophie, hi.
- My mom's right in here.

577
00:35:16,505 --> 00:35:18,072
Hey, Emily.

578
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,421
I got the job.

579
00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:21,510
Morgan Edge called me himself.

580
00:35:21,554 --> 00:35:23,077
I am starting tomorrow.

581
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,557
Emily, I didn't--

582
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,688
Oh, no,
you don't have to take credit.

583
00:35:25,732 --> 00:35:27,255
I totally know it was you.

584
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:29,039
Mr. Edge even said
seeing you and I together

585
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:30,693
is what convinced him
to choose me.

586
00:35:32,304 --> 00:35:34,262
Well, listen, Avery and Duc
are in the car.

587
00:35:34,306 --> 00:35:36,656
I just wanted to come by
and say thank you.

588
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:40,181
Thank you so much.
You have changed my life, Lana.

589
00:35:50,452 --> 00:35:52,193
This better be good news.

590
00:35:52,237 --> 00:35:54,587
The X-Kryptonite just arrived
at the facility.

591
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,241
Everything's ready
to move forward.

592
00:35:57,807 --> 00:35:59,069
So your plan worked.

593
00:35:59,113 --> 00:36:00,854
Even better
than I anticipated.

594
00:36:00,897 --> 00:36:02,551
Lucky you.

595
00:36:03,552 --> 00:36:05,511
Were you able
to find enough Subjekts?

596
00:36:05,554 --> 00:36:09,254
Yes, but there's no guarantee
they'll be receptive hosts.

597
00:36:09,297 --> 00:36:10,690
You're still the only one

598
00:36:10,733 --> 00:36:12,474
who hasn't shown
any signs of rejection.

599
00:36:13,258 --> 00:36:15,869
I guess you have to break
a few eggs to make an omelet.

600
00:36:15,912 --> 00:36:17,305
Indeed.

601
00:36:19,089 --> 00:36:20,830
And now we have our eggs.

602
00:36:25,531 --> 00:36:28,403
DOD has John Irons
on lockdown.

603
00:36:28,447 --> 00:36:30,797
We'll start
the interrogations tomorrow.

604
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,973
I should've
figured it out sooner.

605
00:36:33,016 --> 00:36:34,931
Lois, come on, you can't be
that hard on yourself.

606
00:36:34,975 --> 00:36:36,629
I'm supposed to be
this incredible reporter,

607
00:36:36,672 --> 00:36:37,978
but I got fooled tonight,

608
00:36:38,021 --> 00:36:39,588
and someone almost murdered
my husband.

609
00:36:39,632 --> 00:36:40,937
It's not that simple.

610
00:36:41,851 --> 00:36:45,420
I mean,
the guy's from another world.

611
00:36:45,464 --> 00:36:47,857
I still think there's more
he's not telling us.

612
00:36:47,901 --> 00:36:49,207
So do I.

613
00:36:51,296 --> 00:36:54,168
Which is why John Henry Irons
isn't going anywhere

614
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,475
until we find out
everything he knows.

615
00:36:56,518 --> 00:36:59,260
If it wasn't for the boys,

616
00:36:59,304 --> 00:37:00,827
you might've died tonight.

617
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,089
I got lucky

618
00:37:02,132 --> 00:37:04,178
Jordan's hearing clicked
when it did.

619
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,093
With everything this family
is facing,

620
00:37:06,136 --> 00:37:07,486
we can't rely on luck.

621
00:37:09,618 --> 00:37:11,141
You're right, Clark.

622
00:37:11,185 --> 00:37:12,273
We're not protecting the boys

623
00:37:12,317 --> 00:37:13,883
by keeping secrets from them.

624
00:37:14,797 --> 00:37:16,103
So what do you
want to tell them?

625
00:37:17,931 --> 00:37:19,237
Everything.

626
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,420
Hey, I just--
I wanted to apologize

627
00:37:28,463 --> 00:37:30,683
for spying on you
and Sarah earlier.

628
00:37:36,341 --> 00:37:38,604
I...

629
00:37:38,647 --> 00:37:40,301
I'm really sorry

630
00:37:40,345 --> 00:37:42,521
you have to lie for me
like that all the time.

631
00:37:44,436 --> 00:37:47,482
Actually, this time,
I kinda told the truth.

632
00:37:47,526 --> 00:37:49,876
I mean, not, like, all of it,
obviously, but...

633
00:37:51,443 --> 00:37:53,314
But somehow it--

634
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:54,794
it almost felt worse this way,

635
00:37:54,837 --> 00:37:57,318
'cause it was, like, um,

636
00:37:57,362 --> 00:37:58,972
it's, like, I don't know.
Like, intentional.

637
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,804
It feels like everything
since we got here

638
00:38:04,847 --> 00:38:07,676
has just been a big secret.

639
00:38:08,198 --> 00:38:10,679
I just--I want it
to go back to normal so bad.

640
00:38:12,594 --> 00:38:14,988
To be fair, Jordan, I mean,

641
00:38:15,031 --> 00:38:16,424
I'm pretty sure normal people
have stuff

642
00:38:16,468 --> 00:38:20,123
that they're hiding too.

643
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:21,429
Tonight's probably
been the most scared

644
00:38:21,473 --> 00:38:22,604
I've ever been in my life.

645
00:38:24,563 --> 00:38:28,654
But gotta say,

646
00:38:28,697 --> 00:38:30,786
it was also pretty awesome.

647
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,266
Yeah, okay,
you did total that truck.

648
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,441
Pretty sick.
Bro, I don't even have

649
00:38:33,485 --> 00:38:34,747
a learner's permit.

650
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,052
Or know how to drive!
- I know!

651
00:38:36,096 --> 00:38:39,621
Which was incredibly reckless

652
00:38:39,665 --> 00:38:41,449
and dangerous

653
00:38:41,493 --> 00:38:44,104
and irresponsible

654
00:38:44,147 --> 00:38:47,281
and absolutely... necessary.

655
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,152
You both saved my life tonight,

656
00:38:49,196 --> 00:38:51,024
so I think I owe you
a pretty big thank-you.

657
00:38:51,067 --> 00:38:53,374
Listen, we know that you two
must have a lot of questions

658
00:38:53,418 --> 00:38:55,202
about what's been going on
around here.

659
00:38:56,246 --> 00:38:59,337
Look, we've taught you
not to keep secrets from us.

660
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,991
So we're not gonna keep
secrets from you anymore.

661
00:39:02,035 --> 00:39:04,124
Isn't most of that stuff,like,

662
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:05,517
like, classified though?

663
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,909
Yes.

664
00:39:06,953 --> 00:39:09,172
Which is why none
of what we tell you

665
00:39:09,216 --> 00:39:12,045
can ever leave this house.
Is that understood?

666
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,395
Definitely.Yeah.

667
00:39:16,136 --> 00:39:17,616
All right,
who wants to go first?

668
00:39:21,446 --> 00:39:23,186
What was that deal
with the guy tonight?

669
00:39:34,763 --> 00:39:36,765
I just doubled the output
on the reflex modules,

670
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:39,028
which means--
- We found Kal-El.

671
00:39:42,162 --> 00:39:45,121
It's time.
- Right now?

672
00:39:45,165 --> 00:39:46,514
But the tracking inlay's
still glitchy.

673
00:39:46,558 --> 00:39:48,081
Nat--

674
00:39:48,124 --> 00:39:49,517
And we haven't finished
the hammer yet,

675
00:39:49,561 --> 00:39:51,171
and the AI's still set
for Lex Luthor.

676
00:39:51,214 --> 00:39:53,608
It doesn't matter who
the AI thinks is in the suit.

677
00:39:53,652 --> 00:39:55,393
It has to be now, Bug.

678
00:39:58,352 --> 00:39:59,788
My ship will be here
in two minutes.

679
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:04,445
Look, this is what
we've been preparing for.

680
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:06,360
Our one chance to end it.

681
00:40:08,057 --> 00:40:09,885
I just...

682
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:11,974
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

683
00:40:14,368 --> 00:40:16,283
I'm gonna go out there

684
00:40:16,326 --> 00:40:18,372
and kill him.

685
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:23,116
And then I'm coming right back.

686
00:40:26,032 --> 00:40:28,034
Uh, say it with me.

687
00:40:29,644 --> 00:40:33,474
Forged in fire,
strong as steel.

688
00:40:46,574 --> 00:40:48,402
I love you, Dad.

689
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:53,363
I love you too, Nat
-Bug.

690
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,671
More than anything
in this world.

691
00:41:00,153 --> 00:41:02,503
I'm gonna be right back.

692
00:41:14,907 --> 00:41:17,475
I promise.

693
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,057
I'm gonna be right back.

694
00:41:35,101 --> 00:41:36,972
I promise.

695
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,063
I'm gonna be right back.
