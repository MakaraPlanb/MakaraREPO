1
00:00:00,893 --> 00:00:02,591
- Previously on
"Superman and Lois"...

2
00:00:02,634 --> 00:00:04,201
- Let's just focus on what
we came here for, family.

3
00:00:04,244 --> 00:00:05,637
- I came here
with one purpose--

4
00:00:05,681 --> 00:00:08,292
to further
our Kryptonian heritage.

5
00:00:08,335 --> 00:00:11,295
Krypton will finally
be resurrected,

6
00:00:11,338 --> 00:00:13,689
and we'll have
our mother with us.

7
00:00:13,732 --> 00:00:16,430
Help me do that, brother.
- Not like this.

8
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:17,649
I have to bring back
everyone Edges implanted

9
00:00:17,693 --> 00:00:19,129
with Kryptonian consciousness.

10
00:00:19,172 --> 00:00:20,478
I'll release all my energy
at once.

11
00:00:20,522 --> 00:00:21,784
It'll be enough.

12
00:00:21,827 --> 00:00:23,481
- And you'll be out
of commission for days.

13
00:00:27,746 --> 00:00:29,748
- Dad?
- Sarah.

14
00:00:53,815 --> 00:00:55,773
- No, no, no!

15
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,865
What am I supposed to do now?

16
00:03:07,035 --> 00:03:09,864
- The day has finally come.

17
00:03:09,907 --> 00:03:13,824
It gives me such joy
to see you here.

18
00:03:13,868 --> 00:03:17,654
- Who are you?
- I am Jor-El.

19
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,745
And you...

20
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:24,574
you are my son.

21
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:33,598


22
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:36,739
- What is all this?

23
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:41,091
- This--this is a place
where you can learn

24
00:03:41,134 --> 00:03:44,529
away from the prying eyes
of the world

25
00:03:44,573 --> 00:03:47,315
lessons about
who you really are

26
00:03:47,358 --> 00:03:49,317
and why you were sent here.

27
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,101
- Sent here from where?

28
00:03:51,144 --> 00:03:55,497
- You were born
on the planet Krypton.

29
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,065
Your true name is Kal,

30
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:02,895
the last son
from the house of El.

31
00:04:04,593 --> 00:04:06,638
- Why am I so different?

32
00:04:06,682 --> 00:04:08,597
- The Earth's sun.

33
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,382
Your cells
absorb its radiation

34
00:04:11,426 --> 00:04:13,819
in ways humans cannot

35
00:04:13,863 --> 00:04:17,649
creating
nearly endless energy.

36
00:04:17,693 --> 00:04:20,565
Your skin, bones, muscles

37
00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:24,308
all capable
of unimaginable power.

38
00:04:24,352 --> 00:04:27,398
Over time, I will teach you

39
00:04:27,442 --> 00:04:30,967
how to use that power,

40
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,230
that speed,

41
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:35,711
that strength.

42
00:04:35,754 --> 00:04:38,279
You will learn to do things

43
00:04:38,322 --> 00:04:42,108
you never thought possible
on this Earth.

44
00:04:42,152 --> 00:04:47,375
♪

45
00:04:47,418 --> 00:04:50,378
- Whoo!
[chuckles]

46
00:04:50,421 --> 00:04:52,641
I'm ready, Father.
I can feel it.

47
00:04:52,684 --> 00:04:55,252
- In body and spirit, yes,

48
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:57,689
but there is something else
you need to learn,

49
00:04:57,733 --> 00:05:00,170
something which I cannot
teach you here.

50
00:05:01,432 --> 00:05:05,044
- What is it?
- Why you wish to help them.

51
00:05:08,004 --> 00:05:09,353
Go.

52
00:05:09,397 --> 00:05:11,137
Reconnect with the world.

53
00:05:11,181 --> 00:05:12,835
Open your heart to them.

54
00:05:12,878 --> 00:05:17,361
Find out why you wish
to be their champion.

55
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:44,649
- Did you find
what you were looking for?

56
00:05:46,564 --> 00:05:48,479
- Yeah.
Yeah, I think so.

57
00:06:00,535 --> 00:06:03,407
I found out who I really am.

58
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:13,548
I met my Kryptonian father.
- Kryptonian?

59
00:06:13,591 --> 00:06:18,074
- Krypton is my home planet,
Where I'm really from.

60
00:06:20,468 --> 00:06:24,254
I know why I can do
the things I can do, Mom.

61
00:06:24,297 --> 00:06:27,518
I know why
I was sent to Earth--

62
00:06:27,562 --> 00:06:30,869
to be its champion.

63
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:40,357
- Is that why
you came back home?

64
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:42,490
To be a hero?

65
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:46,624
- Yeah, but not yet.

66
00:06:46,668 --> 00:06:49,410
There's someone
I need to see first.

67
00:06:59,507 --> 00:07:02,640
- Kyle's supposed to be here
any moment.

68
00:07:04,642 --> 00:07:07,340
- Lana!

69
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:08,516
- Hi.

70
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:10,779
- Hey, I got some good news.
- What?

71
00:07:10,822 --> 00:07:12,476
- There's an opening
at the fire station.

72
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,825
- [gasps]
- Yeah.

73
00:07:13,869 --> 00:07:16,045
- Oh, that's amazing.
- [laughs]

74
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,441
- Oh, I'm so happy.

75
00:07:24,532 --> 00:07:25,750
Oh, that's awesome.

76
00:07:25,794 --> 00:07:27,491
- It's gonna be huge.
- Yeah.

77
00:07:27,535 --> 00:07:29,232
- [chuckles]
- Let's go in.

78
00:07:29,275 --> 00:07:30,320
- Okay.

79
00:07:34,716 --> 00:07:36,631
- I'm sorry, Clark.

80
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,635
But you were gone a long time.

81
00:07:40,678 --> 00:07:42,637
People move on
with their lives.

82
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,986
- Yeah.

83
00:07:45,553 --> 00:07:49,078
Yeah, I guess so.
- Come with me.

84
00:07:49,121 --> 00:07:51,472
There's something
I want to show you.

85
00:08:12,841 --> 00:08:14,364
- What is this?

86
00:08:14,407 --> 00:08:19,064
- After you left,
I had a dream of you flying,

87
00:08:19,108 --> 00:08:21,676
only it wasn't the boy
that I knew.

88
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:25,506
It was you now, so I made this.

89
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,164
- Mom...

90
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,515
leaving you after dad died...

91
00:08:34,558 --> 00:08:36,255
- Oh, honey,

92
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,214
it's what you needed
to do then,

93
00:08:38,257 --> 00:08:41,086
and this is what
you need to do now.

94
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,699
It's time for you
to go save the world, Clark.

95
00:08:51,836 --> 00:08:55,492
Still needs something
on the chest, I think.

96
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,235
- Uh, pardon me, ma'am?
Ma'am?

97
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:00,584
Do you know
where Milledge Avenue is?

98
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:02,891
Milledge Avenue.
Milledge Avenue.

99
00:09:02,934 --> 00:09:04,719
Oh, excuse me, sir.
Excuse me.

100
00:09:04,762 --> 00:09:06,677
Do you know
where Milledge Avenue is?

101
00:09:11,726 --> 00:09:14,076
- The brakes are out!
I can't stop!

102
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:15,643
- It's a red light.
Swerve around!

103
00:09:15,686 --> 00:09:17,906
- There are people!
- Watch out!

104
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:40,668
- Whoa!
- Did you see that?

105
00:09:50,852 --> 00:09:52,636
- There you go, friend.
- Thanks.

106
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,855
Cool costume.

107
00:09:53,898 --> 00:09:56,597
- Thanks.
My mom made it for me.

108
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,250
- Oh, my God.
- Whoa!

109
00:09:58,294 --> 00:10:00,818
- Did you see that?
- Yeah, right here. You'll see.

110
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:05,649
- Did you see that?
- See what?

111
00:10:05,693 --> 00:10:08,783
- Some guy just saved a kid
from getting killed by a car,

112
00:10:08,826 --> 00:10:10,654
and then he flew up
into the sky.

113
00:10:10,698 --> 00:10:11,916
- He flew?
- Flew, you know?

114
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,657
Like a bird
or a plane or whatever.

115
00:10:13,701 --> 00:10:14,745
It was crazy.

116
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:16,747
- Did you see
what he looked like?

117
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,532
- He looked like a guy
in a cape that was flying.

118
00:10:19,576 --> 00:10:21,796
Someone at the "Planet"
has gotta hear about this.

119
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:29,151
♪

120
00:10:36,724 --> 00:10:39,248
- This isn't a résumé.
It's a cry for help.

121
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,206
- Oh, well--oh, oh.
Sorry.

122
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,644
See, actually I did
some pretty top-notch reporting

123
00:10:43,687 --> 00:10:45,994
for my school paper.
- Look, this is Metropolis.

124
00:10:46,037 --> 00:10:48,431
I need cub reporters,
not lost puppies.

125
00:10:48,474 --> 00:10:50,694
You come find me when you got
some real world experience.

126
00:10:50,738 --> 00:10:52,565
- Oh, no, no, Mr. White,
Mr. White, please, look.

127
00:10:52,609 --> 00:10:53,915
I'm a really quick learner,

128
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,177
and I'll do whatever you ask.

129
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,309
I just--I just need a chance.

130
00:10:58,789 --> 00:11:00,661
- Okay,
there's no health insurance

131
00:11:00,704 --> 00:11:02,488
or overtime.
- Not a problem.

132
00:11:02,532 --> 00:11:04,882
- And you have to pick up
my dry cleaning every Thursday.

133
00:11:04,926 --> 00:11:06,405
- Yeah, absolutely.
Yes, sir.

134
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:10,496
- Okay, kid, you're hired.
Now, try to keep up.

135
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,412
- Oh, okay.
Do you want--should I--okay.

136
00:11:13,456 --> 00:11:14,500
Yeah, it's--

137
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,982
- Everyone in here, we're
the most dependable friends

138
00:11:18,026 --> 00:11:19,810
the people of Metropolis have.

139
00:11:19,854 --> 00:11:21,290
You remember that.
- Yes, sir.

140
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,423
- Stick with Lane.
She'll show you the ropes.

141
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:25,860
- Lane, sir?

142
00:11:25,903 --> 00:11:27,949
- Who told you to wear a tie?

143
00:11:33,911 --> 00:11:36,697
Let me guess, Lombard?
Ignore him.

144
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,438
Though he can get box seats
to the Meteors.

145
00:11:39,482 --> 00:11:41,789
You like baseball?
- Uh, of course.

146
00:11:41,832 --> 00:11:44,313
I mean, who doesn't like
America's pastime, Ms. Lane?

147
00:11:44,356 --> 00:11:45,444
- It's Lois.

148
00:11:45,488 --> 00:11:46,837
What'd you say
your name was again?

149
00:11:46,881 --> 00:11:48,883
- Kent. Clark. Clark Kent.

150
00:11:48,926 --> 00:11:52,147
Oh, oh, sorry.

151
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,976
- Hm, never met a Clark before.

152
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,935
- Oh, I've never met
a Lois before.

153
00:11:57,979 --> 00:12:00,068
Actually, there was
my first-grade teacher,

154
00:12:00,111 --> 00:12:01,591
Lois Hannigan,
so I guess technically--

155
00:12:01,634 --> 00:12:03,332
oh, technically
you'd be the second.

156
00:12:04,637 --> 00:12:06,683
You know, Miss Hannigan was
actually my favorite teacher.

157
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:08,859
She--she taught me
about fractions and cursive.

158
00:12:08,903 --> 00:12:11,949
- Mystery man strikes again.
Third time this month.

159
00:12:11,993 --> 00:12:13,081
- Where was he?

160
00:12:13,124 --> 00:12:14,952
- Saved a boat
sinking off Hob's River.

161
00:12:14,996 --> 00:12:16,214
Jimmy even got a photo.

162
00:12:16,258 --> 00:12:19,043
This is my Pulitzer, Lane.
I can feel it.

163
00:12:20,349 --> 00:12:22,003
- Seems like
a pretty big story.

164
00:12:22,046 --> 00:12:23,918
- Yeah,
which every reporter here

165
00:12:23,961 --> 00:12:26,877
is tripping over themselves
to cover.

166
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:28,313
Boys and their heroes.

167
00:12:28,357 --> 00:12:30,794
- [chuckles]
Aren't heroes a good thing?

168
00:12:30,838 --> 00:12:32,665
- Yeah, of course, and I know
that we need this guy.

169
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:34,145
It's just that
ever since he showed up,

170
00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:36,278
he's been dominating
the conversation.

171
00:12:36,321 --> 00:12:37,932
Metropolis has so many problems

172
00:12:37,975 --> 00:12:40,021
that aren't just
rescue operations.

173
00:12:40,064 --> 00:12:43,198
They're systemic.
Here, look at this.

174
00:12:46,854 --> 00:12:49,030
- These lightning bolts.
- Nazi symbols.

175
00:12:49,073 --> 00:12:51,467
They've been popping up
all over lower Metropolis

176
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,599
along with a rash
of arson attacks

177
00:12:53,643 --> 00:12:55,340
against
minority-owned businesses.

178
00:12:55,384 --> 00:12:57,821
- Do you have any idea
who's responsible?

179
00:12:57,865 --> 00:12:59,997
- By all accounts, some psycho

180
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,869
in a metal mask
and a trench coat.

181
00:13:03,696 --> 00:13:06,308
- I didn't know about this.
- That's my point exactly.

182
00:13:06,351 --> 00:13:08,049
I have been covering this
for months,

183
00:13:08,092 --> 00:13:10,051
only my reporting
keeps getting drowned out

184
00:13:10,094 --> 00:13:12,053
by everyone's favorite
miracle man.

185
00:13:14,098 --> 00:13:15,578
- How can I help?

186
00:13:27,285 --> 00:13:29,853
- Psycho in a metal mask
and a trench coat?

187
00:13:29,897 --> 00:13:32,508
That sounds--
sir, I'm listening to you.

188
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,258
- Whoo!

189
00:13:43,301 --> 00:13:43,998
Yes!

190
00:13:49,046 --> 00:13:51,092
- Clark, Clark,
I gotta show you something.

191
00:13:51,135 --> 00:13:52,789
- Well, I gotta get these
to Perry before he goes home.

192
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:56,793
- Guess who was just arrested?
- Oh.

193
00:14:10,546 --> 00:14:13,288
- You don't need that.
- Wait--oh, no, I gotta--

194
00:14:13,331 --> 00:14:15,943
okay.

195
00:14:15,986 --> 00:14:17,814
- One of these dirt bags
is our guy.

196
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:19,207
I can feel it.

197
00:14:21,122 --> 00:14:23,602
- You're really good at this.

198
00:14:25,735 --> 00:14:26,954
- Thanks.

199
00:14:32,046 --> 00:14:35,788
- I, um...I should get going.

200
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,879
- What's the hurry.

201
00:14:40,054 --> 00:14:41,969
You got a big date?
- [chuckles]

202
00:14:42,012 --> 00:14:43,231
No, no, nothing like that.

203
00:14:43,274 --> 00:14:47,191
Just, you know,
some "Seinfeld" reruns.

204
00:14:47,235 --> 00:14:50,238
Heat up some
frozen chicken nuggets.

205
00:14:51,413 --> 00:14:53,981
- You've been
a really big help, Clark.

206
00:14:54,024 --> 00:14:56,331
If you want,
I can probably talk to Perry

207
00:14:56,374 --> 00:14:58,246
about you getting
a beat of your own,

208
00:14:58,289 --> 00:15:00,030
local politics or something.

209
00:15:00,074 --> 00:15:04,078
- Oh. Um...no.

210
00:15:04,121 --> 00:15:07,733
That's--it's okay.
I'd rather be here.

211
00:15:08,473 --> 00:15:11,172
- For the story or the company?

212
00:15:11,215 --> 00:15:13,217
- Uh...
[laughs]

213
00:15:13,261 --> 00:15:16,525
I feel like
that's a trick question.

214
00:15:18,744 --> 00:15:22,052
- Good night, Clark.
- Good night, Lois.

215
00:15:42,116 --> 00:15:43,334
You seen Lois?

216
00:15:43,378 --> 00:15:45,380
- Her contact at the library
called back

217
00:15:45,423 --> 00:15:47,817
about some guy who works
at a hardware store.

218
00:15:54,084 --> 00:15:56,869
- Henry Miller?
- Hmm.

219
00:16:00,873 --> 00:16:04,181
- You can't do this, Henry.
They've done nothing wrong.

220
00:16:04,225 --> 00:16:06,314
- They don't belong here.

221
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,277
- This isn't
track and field, Kent!

222
00:16:15,105 --> 00:16:17,847
- These people
have stolen my neighborhood,

223
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:21,024
and you're spinning it
like I'm the bad guy?

224
00:16:21,068 --> 00:16:22,808
I'm the damn hero!

225
00:16:55,493 --> 00:16:57,669
- Even you can't save
all of them.

226
00:17:18,255 --> 00:17:20,257
- Who's the hero now?

227
00:17:29,658 --> 00:17:31,747
How'd you know about this?

228
00:17:33,923 --> 00:17:36,273
- I've been reading
your reports in the "Planet,"

229
00:17:36,317 --> 00:17:38,797
but also my hearing.

230
00:17:38,841 --> 00:17:40,277
- Your hearing?

231
00:17:40,321 --> 00:17:41,191
- Oh.
[chuckles]

232
00:17:41,235 --> 00:17:44,107
My super-hearing.

233
00:17:44,151 --> 00:17:46,675
- We haven't formally met.
I'm Lois Lane.

234
00:17:46,718 --> 00:17:48,242
- It's nice to meet you,
Ms. Lane.

235
00:17:48,285 --> 00:17:50,418
- And you are who exactly?

236
00:17:50,461 --> 00:17:54,248
Mister Metropolis?
Red and Blue Man?

237
00:17:55,901 --> 00:17:58,034
I'm sure
you'll come up with something.

238
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:10,568
- Who was that?
- Superman.

239
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:19,142
- Welcome
to the "Daily Planet Today."

240
00:18:19,186 --> 00:18:21,362
I'm Lois Lane,
and with me for his first

241
00:18:21,405 --> 00:18:24,408
on-camera interview
is Superman.

242
00:18:24,452 --> 00:18:26,149
I appreciate you
agreeing to be here.

243
00:18:26,193 --> 00:18:27,759
- Thanks for having me.

244
00:18:27,803 --> 00:18:29,761
- Now, as you know, the world
has been captivated by you

245
00:18:29,805 --> 00:18:31,763
ever since your first
appearance in Metropolis

246
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,288
over a year ago,
and one of the big questions

247
00:18:34,331 --> 00:18:36,203
that always gets asked
regarding Superman

248
00:18:36,246 --> 00:18:39,206
is how long you were
on Earth before that.

249
00:18:39,249 --> 00:18:41,077
- Well,
essentially my whole life.

250
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:43,645
After my planet was destroyed--
- Krypton.

251
00:18:43,688 --> 00:18:46,256
- Right,
when Krypton was destroyed,

252
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,171
the pod that allowed me
to escape

253
00:18:48,215 --> 00:18:49,520
crashed here on Earth.

254
00:18:49,564 --> 00:18:51,740
- Where exactly on Earth?

255
00:18:51,783 --> 00:18:53,829
- That's not something
I'm ready to reveal yet.

256
00:18:53,872 --> 00:18:56,136
- The assumption is that
it was somewhere in the U.S.

257
00:18:56,179 --> 00:18:59,139
- Well, don't assume that just
because I'm speaking English.

258
00:18:59,163 --> 00:19:01,163


259
00:19:01,663 --> 00:19:03,969
- You speak multiple languages.
Is that also a superpower?

260
00:19:04,013 --> 00:19:05,232
- [laughs]
No.

261
00:19:05,275 --> 00:19:07,451
Just curiosity about the world.

262
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:09,323
I wanted to know more
about different people,

263
00:19:09,366 --> 00:19:13,240
different regions,
so I studied their languages.

264
00:19:13,283 --> 00:19:14,632
- How many languages?

265
00:19:16,025 --> 00:19:17,244
- All of them.

266
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:21,248
- What would you say
to the people of the world

267
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,641
when asked what you stand for?

268
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:28,342
- I'd like to think
everything good and decent.

269
00:19:28,385 --> 00:19:30,605
Truth, justice.

270
00:19:30,648 --> 00:19:32,607
- The American way?

271
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,826
- [chuckles]
I think someone's just trying

272
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,567
to get me to admit
I was raised here.

273
00:19:39,353 --> 00:19:41,093
- Cut!

274
00:19:41,137 --> 00:19:43,226
Can someone please
take a look at Lois' mic?

275
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,880
- All right, everybody,
let's stand by

276
00:19:44,923 --> 00:19:46,403
for sound check.
Stand by please.

277
00:19:46,447 --> 00:19:48,013
- I feel like
we're not getting anywhere.

278
00:19:48,057 --> 00:19:49,319
- I can't believe it.

279
00:19:49,363 --> 00:19:51,234
- No, I know, he's, like,
giving me the runaround.

280
00:19:51,278 --> 00:19:55,978
- No, not that.
I think Superman is into you.

281
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,502
- Don't be ridiculous.

282
00:19:58,546 --> 00:20:00,330
- The way
he keeps smiling at you?

283
00:20:00,374 --> 00:20:02,202
I dream of having someone
look at me like that.

284
00:20:02,245 --> 00:20:04,378
It's basically how
all my favorite movies end.

285
00:20:04,421 --> 00:20:07,729
- Janet, he's Superman.
It's part of his whole shtick.

286
00:20:07,772 --> 00:20:09,470
He looks at people
in a nice way.

287
00:20:09,513 --> 00:20:12,734
- Okay, listen, I'm not talking
to you as your producer.

288
00:20:12,777 --> 00:20:14,344
I'm talking to you
as one of your best friends.

289
00:20:14,388 --> 00:20:16,041
And I am telling you...
- Janet.

290
00:20:16,085 --> 00:20:18,305
- There is some
serious chemistry happening...

291
00:20:18,348 --> 00:20:19,523
- Listen to me.

292
00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:21,046
- And you need
to bring your A game

293
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,439
if you wanna go out

294
00:20:22,483 --> 00:20:23,397
with the world's
most eligible bachelor.

295
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,529
- I am not interested, okay?

296
00:20:25,573 --> 00:20:27,531
I'm in love with someone else.

297
00:20:29,577 --> 00:20:31,753
Clark from the paper.

298
00:20:31,796 --> 00:20:33,624
We've been dating
for a couple months.

299
00:20:33,668 --> 00:20:35,496
I know he's dorky,
but I love him.

300
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:38,150
- Right,
the guy with the glasses.

301
00:20:38,194 --> 00:20:39,282
- Yeah.
- He's so sweet.

302
00:20:39,326 --> 00:20:40,892
- Yeah.
- Well, that's great, Lois.

303
00:20:40,936 --> 00:20:43,286
I--I had no idea
you were in love.

304
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:46,333
- That's because I haven't
told anyone yet, not even him.

305
00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:50,728
- Hey, random
Superman question.

306
00:20:50,772 --> 00:20:52,991
He wouldn't happen
to have super-hearing?

307
00:21:01,913 --> 00:21:03,350
- [whispers]
Can we just go?

308
00:21:03,393 --> 00:21:05,308
- [whispers]
Yeah, yeah.

309
00:21:10,574 --> 00:21:12,663
- [clears throat]
I apologize.

310
00:21:12,707 --> 00:21:14,622
That was unprofessional.

311
00:21:14,665 --> 00:21:18,060
- That's okay.
He's a--he's a lucky man.

312
00:21:18,103 --> 00:21:20,758
- Don't think this means
I'm gonna take it easy on you.

313
00:21:20,802 --> 00:21:23,239
- I'd be offended if you did.
- Okay.

314
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:24,414
Ready?

315
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:25,807
I'm nervous.

316
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,026
- I didn't think
you got nervous.

317
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,898
- Well, it's your mom, Clark.
What if she doesn't like me?

318
00:21:29,941 --> 00:21:31,595
- [laughs]
That's not possible.

319
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:33,554
- Maybe you haven't seen
the reader mail section

320
00:21:33,597 --> 00:21:36,470
of the newspaper, but trust me,
it's very possible.

321
00:21:36,513 --> 00:21:37,558
Hi.

322
00:21:37,601 --> 00:21:41,126
- Oh, I'm so glad
you could make it.

323
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:44,521
Oh, look at you.
[laughs]

324
00:21:44,565 --> 00:21:47,176
Ever since Clark told me
about the two of you,

325
00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:49,221
I couldn't wait
to have you out to the farm.

326
00:21:49,265 --> 00:21:50,571
- Told you.

327
00:21:50,614 --> 00:21:52,355
- Well, I'm happy
to finally make it.

328
00:21:52,399 --> 00:21:53,922
- Oh, thank you.

329
00:21:53,965 --> 00:21:57,012
Lots of folks in Smallville
are dying to meet you too.

330
00:21:57,055 --> 00:21:59,057
- Mom, Mom, Mom, you promised.
- Oh, Clark.

331
00:21:59,101 --> 00:22:00,972
It's just the neighbors
and Edelsteins

332
00:22:01,016 --> 00:22:03,453
and, you know,
girls from bridge club, so...

333
00:22:03,497 --> 00:22:05,368
- Well, I'm very excited
to meet everyone.

334
00:22:05,412 --> 00:22:08,589
- Well, come on inside.
I've got lunch waiting.

335
00:22:15,422 --> 00:22:17,206
She's wonderful.

336
00:22:17,249 --> 00:22:19,295
- Yeah, I know.

337
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:22,124
- So what took you so long
to bring her here?

338
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:26,389
- Because I needed to be ready.
- To meet me?

339
00:22:26,433 --> 00:22:28,173
- That's not what I meant.

340
00:22:29,697 --> 00:22:34,484
I brought her here to tell her
who I really am.

341
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,705
- Oh, are you sure?

342
00:22:37,748 --> 00:22:39,663
Once you tell her,
there's no going back.

343
00:22:39,707 --> 00:22:42,492
- Yeah, well...

344
00:22:42,536 --> 00:22:45,321
there was no going back
after the first time I saw her.

345
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:48,237
- I'm so happy for you, honey.

346
00:22:50,544 --> 00:22:52,502
- Everything okay?

347
00:22:52,546 --> 00:22:56,071
- Everything's perfect, dear.
Just perfect.

348
00:22:57,638 --> 00:23:00,641
- You follow me.
I wanna show you something.

349
00:23:35,806 --> 00:23:38,374
[crowd cheering]
- Love you, Lois!

350
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:41,246
Love you, Clark!

351
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,640
- I can't believe
I married Lois Lane.

352
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:49,559
- I'm all yours, babe.
For better or for worse.

353
00:23:51,692 --> 00:23:52,997
- You know, I...

354
00:23:54,956 --> 00:23:58,873
I kept my secret
from everyone for so long,

355
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:00,831
and now I know why.

356
00:24:03,704 --> 00:24:05,183
It's for you.

357
00:24:06,228 --> 00:24:09,449
So we could have
this life together.

358
00:24:11,755 --> 00:24:14,410
- There's no one
I'd rather share it with.

359
00:24:15,411 --> 00:24:17,065
- This might be
a weird time to say it,

360
00:24:17,108 --> 00:24:20,547
but I can't wait to tell my dad
about the wedding.

361
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,897
He's gonna be so excited.

362
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,857
I mean, as excited
as a hologram can get, I guess.

363
00:24:26,901 --> 00:24:29,686
- Well, he's gonna have to wait
till after the honeymoon.

364
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:37,346
♪

365
00:24:37,389 --> 00:24:40,480
- How was
your marriage ceremony, son?

366
00:24:41,568 --> 00:24:42,830
- It was the perfect day.

367
00:24:42,873 --> 00:24:44,614
Lois looked beautiful.

368
00:24:44,658 --> 00:24:46,094
I wish
you could have been there.

369
00:24:46,137 --> 00:24:48,183
- I need you
to get out of here now, Son.

370
00:24:50,054 --> 00:24:52,404
- Father, what's happening?
- Go!

371
00:24:54,015 --> 00:24:56,408
Get out of here now!

372
00:25:06,767 --> 00:25:09,900
- Hey, babe, there's something
I need to tell you.

373
00:25:09,944 --> 00:25:12,337
- Lois, what day is it?
- I'm pregnant.

374
00:25:14,252 --> 00:25:16,690
- You're pregnant?
- Yes.

375
00:25:16,733 --> 00:25:18,474
I know, we weren't even trying.

376
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:19,867
We didn't even know
this was possible,

377
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,651
but there are
three pregnancy tests

378
00:25:21,695 --> 00:25:23,871
in the bathroom, and they all
say the same thing.

379
00:25:25,612 --> 00:25:27,265
We're gonna be parents.

380
00:25:28,223 --> 00:25:30,181
- Okay, Lois, something
really strange happened

381
00:25:30,225 --> 00:25:33,054
right before you came out.
- I can't believe it either.

382
00:25:33,097 --> 00:25:35,056
It's like you said
on our honeymoon.

383
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:37,624
This is why
you kept your secret.

384
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:39,756
- So we can share
our life together.

385
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,150
- And now we can have a family.

386
00:25:42,193 --> 00:25:43,978
I didn't even realize
I wanted one

387
00:25:44,021 --> 00:25:46,458
this badly until now.

388
00:25:46,502 --> 00:25:48,809
- Yeah. Yeah, me too.

389
00:25:48,852 --> 00:25:50,941
- Okay, be honest,
you want a boy or a girl?

390
00:25:50,985 --> 00:25:53,422
- I--I just want the baby
to be healthy.

391
00:25:53,465 --> 00:25:54,815
- Come on, Clark.
That's so predictable.

392
00:25:54,858 --> 00:25:56,381
- What?
It's true.

393
00:25:56,425 --> 00:25:57,774
- All right,
well, I'm just gonna say it.

394
00:25:57,818 --> 00:25:59,646
I want a girl.
- Okay.

395
00:25:59,689 --> 00:26:00,734
- Okay.

396
00:26:04,389 --> 00:26:07,175
- Oh, my.
- Is everything okay?

397
00:26:07,218 --> 00:26:10,613
- Yes, it's just more okay.

398
00:26:13,007 --> 00:26:14,835
Looks like you two
are going to have twins.

399
00:26:14,878 --> 00:26:16,140
- What?
Are you sure?

400
00:26:16,184 --> 00:26:17,968
- Ooh, is that a--you know?

401
00:26:18,012 --> 00:26:19,883
- Very,
and I can't say for certain,

402
00:26:19,927 --> 00:26:23,147
but, yes,
they do appear to be boys.

403
00:26:23,191 --> 00:26:25,410
- This is what I get
for wanting a girl.

404
00:26:25,454 --> 00:26:27,456
- I can't believe I'm gonna
be a dad twice all at once.

405
00:26:27,499 --> 00:26:30,764
- Can you get me
some water, please?

406
00:26:30,807 --> 00:26:32,592
- Babe.

407
00:26:33,941 --> 00:26:35,769
- Do you think
this is because of Superman?

408
00:26:35,812 --> 00:26:38,641
- My father assured me
everything's gonna be fine.

409
00:26:38,685 --> 00:26:40,208
- He also didn't know
we were having twins,

410
00:26:40,251 --> 00:26:41,731
and that is
a pretty big curve ball.

411
00:26:41,775 --> 00:26:44,473
- Hey, it's gonna be okay.
I promise.

412
00:26:44,516 --> 00:26:46,301
- Yeah, says the guy
who doesn't have to give birth

413
00:26:46,344 --> 00:26:47,868
to two babies at the same time.

414
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,799
Clark, I'm not delivering
the babies at the fortress.

415
00:27:10,673 --> 00:27:12,370
- This isn't real.

416
00:27:19,421 --> 00:27:21,641
- In a lifetime
full of memories,

417
00:27:21,684 --> 00:27:23,773
there is none more special
than becoming a father.

418
00:27:27,362 --> 00:27:29,843
- What have you done?
- Easy, Kal-El.

419
00:27:29,886 --> 00:27:32,411
I'd hate for you
to miss the big moment.

420
00:27:32,454 --> 00:27:33,760
- [screams]
- You're doing great.

421
00:27:33,803 --> 00:27:38,112
We're almost there.
- Yeah, 27 hours later.

422
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,636
- Edge is here somehow.
- I love you too.

423
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,247
[screams]
- Just one more push, Lois,

424
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:43,857
and baby Jonathan
can meet Jordan.

425
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,339
- He knows everything.
- [screams]

426
00:27:47,382 --> 00:27:48,688
[baby crying]
- You did it!

427
00:27:48,731 --> 00:27:51,865
- We have a family, Clark.
- Yes, you do.

428
00:27:54,999 --> 00:27:56,523
Jordan and Jonathan Kent,

429
00:27:56,566 --> 00:27:59,700
the twin sons
of Lois and Superman.

430
00:27:59,743 --> 00:28:01,702
- No. No, please. Please.
They're just babies.

431
00:28:01,745 --> 00:28:04,270
- How little
you know me, brother.

432
00:28:04,313 --> 00:28:05,923
I would never harm a newborn.

433
00:28:08,448 --> 00:28:10,754
Teenage boys,
on the other hand...

434
00:28:11,364 --> 00:28:14,062
That's a different
matter entirely.

435
00:28:20,851 --> 00:28:23,637
It's good you're awake, Kal-El.

436
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,249
Now you and I can discuss
the terms of your surrender.

437
00:28:34,387 --> 00:28:38,260
- My sons
are not bargaining chips.

438
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:43,483
- This device
was created by Ter-Loc,

439
00:28:43,526 --> 00:28:45,920
one of Krypton's
greatest scientists.

440
00:28:45,963 --> 00:28:49,924
It allows the user to navigate
the resting mind of another.

441
00:28:49,967 --> 00:28:52,666
- You knew I'd be weak
from my solar flare.

442
00:28:52,709 --> 00:28:54,581
- So I followed you here

443
00:28:54,624 --> 00:28:58,237
where I could sift through
your most precious memories.

444
00:29:00,326 --> 00:29:04,417
- To extort me?
- No, Kal, to understand you.

445
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,506
To understand
what possible reason

446
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:08,421
you could have
to betray your heritage.

447
00:29:08,464 --> 00:29:11,119
And to think it was all
for a human family.

448
00:29:11,162 --> 00:29:13,861
- You know nothing about them.
- I know enough.

449
00:29:13,904 --> 00:29:17,734
A human wife and twin boys.
How woefully pedestrian.

450
00:29:17,778 --> 00:29:20,346
And you, stumbling
through your daily life

451
00:29:20,389 --> 00:29:21,477
like some village idiot

452
00:29:21,521 --> 00:29:23,349
instead of a true son
of Krypton.

453
00:29:23,392 --> 00:29:26,134
- I'm not the only one who kept
my Kryptonian side hidden.

454
00:29:26,177 --> 00:29:29,529
- I did so out of strategy,
not shame.

455
00:29:29,572 --> 00:29:33,489
To be a man of greatness
and choose to be less...

456
00:29:34,925 --> 00:29:37,537
It speaks to the mediocrity
of this world.

457
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,409
- Whatever it is you want,

458
00:29:40,453 --> 00:29:44,283
threatening my family
is not how you'll get it.

459
00:29:44,326 --> 00:29:45,632
- It's not a threat, Kal.

460
00:29:45,675 --> 00:29:48,722
I will destroy their lives
by taking that thing

461
00:29:48,765 --> 00:29:50,767
you hold so dear, your secret,

462
00:29:50,811 --> 00:29:52,769
and shouting it
for all the world to hear.

463
00:29:52,813 --> 00:29:55,424
Superman has a family.
- No!

464
00:29:55,468 --> 00:29:57,600
- Then tell me another way.

465
00:29:57,644 --> 00:30:00,255
I appealed to you as a brother,
and you attacked me,

466
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,388
a Kryptonian,
and you stole from me,

467
00:30:02,431 --> 00:30:05,304
a friend, and you destroyed
everything I had built.

468
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:08,568
- He is none of those things.
Do not listen to him!

469
00:30:08,611 --> 00:30:12,789
- It is this man
who has corrupted you,

470
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:15,009
just as he
corrupted our mother.

471
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:20,362
- I spoke with her. Lara.

472
00:30:20,406 --> 00:30:23,496
She believes
there is still good in you.

473
00:30:24,497 --> 00:30:26,281
- Was this
as she helped you plot

474
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:27,761
to destroy Kryptonian lives?

475
00:30:27,804 --> 00:30:29,763
- The same lives that occupied

476
00:30:29,806 --> 00:30:31,199
innocent human beings?

477
00:30:31,242 --> 00:30:32,505
- Enough!

478
00:30:32,548 --> 00:30:36,160
I will not debate morality
with this whisper.

479
00:30:38,598 --> 00:30:40,469
Here I stand, brother.

480
00:30:40,513 --> 00:30:43,385
Flesh and bone
and beating heart.

481
00:30:43,429 --> 00:30:46,606
Your true family.

482
00:30:46,649 --> 00:30:50,131
Join me of your own free will.

483
00:30:51,654 --> 00:30:54,483
- I can't let you do this.

484
00:30:54,527 --> 00:30:57,530
- Then I will make you suffer.

485
00:31:05,451 --> 00:31:07,757
- I love you, son.

486
00:31:22,816 --> 00:31:25,645
- You are my life's greatest
disappointment, Kal-El.

487
00:31:25,688 --> 00:31:27,516
All my life, I dreamt

488
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,824
of having a brother, a family,

489
00:31:30,867 --> 00:31:33,043
only to have you reject me!

490
00:31:39,093 --> 00:31:41,312
It didn't have to be this way.

491
00:31:56,589 --> 00:31:59,940
- This head is pounding worse
than after ten whiskey chasers.

492
00:31:59,983 --> 00:32:01,463
- From everything we can tell,

493
00:32:01,507 --> 00:32:03,552
it should go away
in a day or two.

494
00:32:03,596 --> 00:32:05,685
- How's Emily doing?

495
00:32:05,728 --> 00:32:08,557
- Confused. Overwhelmed.

496
00:32:08,601 --> 00:32:09,950
- What's she know, exactly?

497
00:32:09,993 --> 00:32:12,518
- Just the broad strokes,
same as everyone else.

498
00:32:12,561 --> 00:32:14,302
Edge was giving people powers,

499
00:32:14,345 --> 00:32:16,086
messing with their minds
to control them.

500
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,437
- Nothing about
alien consciousness?

501
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,657
- DOD felt that would be
better kept off the record.

502
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:24,094
- Still a lot to process.

503
00:32:24,138 --> 00:32:27,837
And people in this town
are gonna want answers.

504
00:32:27,881 --> 00:32:30,492
- Yeah, at which point
they're gonna be looking

505
00:32:30,536 --> 00:32:33,277
for someone to blame,
and pretty sure

506
00:32:33,321 --> 00:32:35,018
I'm gonna be
at the top of that list.

507
00:32:36,411 --> 00:32:38,631
- Your heart was
in the right place, babe.

508
00:32:38,674 --> 00:32:40,154
- Heart's not the problems.

509
00:32:40,197 --> 00:32:44,506
It's this stubborn head of mine
refusing to listen.

510
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:47,509
I should've never gone
to see Edge behind your back.

511
00:32:49,859 --> 00:32:53,036
- Speaking of Edge,
any idea where he went?

512
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,909
- Superman and the DOD
are looking for him.

513
00:32:55,952 --> 00:32:57,780
I'm sure he'll turn up soon.

514
00:32:57,824 --> 00:32:59,739
- It's like a war zone downtown

515
00:32:59,782 --> 00:33:01,523
with all
of the military patrolling.

516
00:33:01,567 --> 00:33:03,917
It's very end of days.

517
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,701
- I think Grandpa said
they're gonna be leaving soon.

518
00:33:05,745 --> 00:33:07,311
They just have to check in

519
00:33:07,355 --> 00:33:09,792
on everybody that was
mind-swapped or whatever.

520
00:33:09,836 --> 00:33:12,839
- My dad has his good side
and his not-so-good side,

521
00:33:12,882 --> 00:33:17,757
but seeing him become
a whole different person is--

522
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,237
- Must've been strange.
- Super weird.

523
00:33:20,281 --> 00:33:24,285
- I just instantly assumed
the worst about him,

524
00:33:24,328 --> 00:33:27,810
even though my mom told me
that it wasn't all his fault.

525
00:33:27,854 --> 00:33:29,856
- Well, sometimes
it's hard to tell

526
00:33:29,899 --> 00:33:31,553
when parents are
telling you the truth.

527
00:33:31,597 --> 00:33:34,338
- It's probably the same
for them, you know, with us.

528
00:33:34,382 --> 00:33:36,732
It seems like families
are always lying to each other,

529
00:33:36,776 --> 00:33:39,692
which is pretty messed up.

530
00:33:39,735 --> 00:33:43,696
So thank you for being honest
with me about everything.

531
00:33:43,739 --> 00:33:45,567
- Yeah.
Yeah, sure.

532
00:33:45,611 --> 00:33:48,091
Just--I'm sorry it was a--

533
00:33:48,135 --> 00:33:50,137
sorry it was such
a traumatic experience.

534
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,921
- At least it was the truth.

535
00:33:54,402 --> 00:33:58,362
Is it cool if I have
a moment alone with Jordan?

536
00:33:59,755 --> 00:34:02,279
- Yeah.
Yeah, sure.

537
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:11,332
- Sarah, I--I'm so sorry

538
00:34:11,375 --> 00:34:13,160
I didn't tell you everything
that was happening.

539
00:34:13,203 --> 00:34:14,770
John even wanted me
to tell you,

540
00:34:14,814 --> 00:34:17,599
and I--I said no.
I was really scared.

541
00:34:17,643 --> 00:34:18,687
I--

542
00:34:23,953 --> 00:34:28,523
- I don't want to be
just friends anymore.

543
00:34:29,872 --> 00:34:31,482
- Me neither.

544
00:34:42,755 --> 00:34:44,844
- Uh, Lois,

545
00:34:44,887 --> 00:34:48,456
hold--hold up
just a--just a second.

546
00:34:48,499 --> 00:34:50,501
Um...

547
00:34:50,545 --> 00:34:53,853
Listen, I just--
I wanted to apologize to you,

548
00:34:53,896 --> 00:34:55,594
you know, for the way
I've treated you

549
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:57,160
this whole time.

550
00:34:57,204 --> 00:34:59,641
- It's okay, Kyle.
- No. No, it's not.

551
00:35:00,686 --> 00:35:04,907
Look, I was wrong about--
about damn near everything,

552
00:35:04,951 --> 00:35:09,433
but...mostly,
I was wrong about you.

553
00:35:09,477 --> 00:35:12,132
You're good people, Lois,

554
00:35:12,175 --> 00:35:14,438
and I'm real happy
you're part of this town.

555
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:16,876
- Thank you.

556
00:35:26,799 --> 00:35:30,672
- So it's, like,
really official official now

557
00:35:30,716 --> 00:35:32,195
or what?

558
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:34,197
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Yeah?

559
00:35:34,241 --> 00:35:36,286
- Well, I'm happy
for you, sweetie,

560
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,158
but now that you
have a girlfriend,

561
00:35:38,201 --> 00:35:39,812
your dad and I
are gonna have to have

562
00:35:39,855 --> 00:35:41,857
a little chitchat
with you about what we expect.

563
00:35:43,729 --> 00:35:44,730
- Guess Dad's home.

564
00:35:47,863 --> 00:35:49,952
- Your father won't be
returning any time soon,

565
00:35:49,996 --> 00:35:53,477
which is why Uncle Morgan
decided to come pay a visit.

566
00:35:58,569 --> 00:36:00,789
- So this is the life
Kal-El chose.

567
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:03,879
It's even more
disappointing up close.

568
00:36:03,923 --> 00:36:05,228
- You're not welcome here.

569
00:36:05,272 --> 00:36:08,884
- That's no way
to speak to family, Lois,

570
00:36:08,928 --> 00:36:10,625
especially
with young boys around.

571
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:11,931
- Where's our dad?

572
00:36:11,974 --> 00:36:13,802
- When I left him,
he was a crumpled heap

573
00:36:13,846 --> 00:36:15,064
in his little ice castle.

574
00:36:15,108 --> 00:36:16,892
Peculiar place
to build a fortress.

575
00:36:16,936 --> 00:36:18,459
I chose the desert.

576
00:36:18,502 --> 00:36:20,896
Like to feel the sun
on my face.

577
00:36:22,071 --> 00:36:25,031
- Leave, now.
- Jordan, stop.

578
00:36:25,074 --> 00:36:27,990
- Oh, I see your son's
inherited your false bravado.

579
00:36:31,167 --> 00:36:32,473
- Jordan!

580
00:36:33,517 --> 00:36:36,825
- Stay away from my sons!
- This is all your doing.

581
00:36:36,869 --> 00:36:38,566
It was your influence
that made him

582
00:36:38,609 --> 00:36:40,307
turn his back
on his own people.

583
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:42,744
- Let them go.
This is between you and me.

584
00:36:42,788 --> 00:36:45,704
- I'm afraid we've passed
that point, Ms. Lane,

585
00:36:45,747 --> 00:36:49,751
but I will let them live
long enough to watch you die.

586
00:36:55,757 --> 00:36:59,108
Impressive, Kal-El.
But this changes nothing.

587
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:05,941
- I'll do whatever you ask.
Just leave my family alone.

588
00:37:10,424 --> 00:37:13,819
- Pledge to me
that you will submit,

589
00:37:13,862 --> 00:37:16,865
and I promise
to let them live unharmed.

590
00:37:16,909 --> 00:37:19,346
- Clark, please don't do this.

591
00:37:20,913 --> 00:37:22,653
- I submit.

592
00:37:26,527 --> 00:37:28,921
- Take a good look
at the man you knew,

593
00:37:28,964 --> 00:37:31,445
'cause it will be your last.

594
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:35,710
- I'm sorry.

595
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,059
We needed more time.

596
00:37:39,453 --> 00:37:41,107
He was right.

597
00:37:57,863 --> 00:38:00,909
- This is--
- My home.

598
00:38:10,527 --> 00:38:13,139
I'm ready, Father.

599
00:38:41,907 --> 00:38:44,605
- Finally.

600
00:38:44,648 --> 00:38:46,172
My son.

601
00:38:47,303 --> 00:38:50,002
What year is it on this Earth?

602
00:38:50,045 --> 00:38:52,265
- By their measurements, 1987.

603
00:38:52,308 --> 00:38:55,485
- And the Eradicator,
you possess it?

604
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,053
- Not yet.

605
00:38:58,097 --> 00:39:00,839
- Did I birth a fool
for a son?

606
00:39:00,882 --> 00:39:02,841
Your mission was simple!

607
00:39:02,884 --> 00:39:06,061
- I've spent years searching,
but it is still yet to arrive.

608
00:39:07,671 --> 00:39:09,064
- I see.

609
00:39:09,108 --> 00:39:12,111
Well, we must prepare

610
00:39:12,154 --> 00:39:13,242
in the interim.

611
00:39:13,286 --> 00:39:15,244
I will train you myself.

612
00:39:15,288 --> 00:39:16,855
- Thank you, Father.

613
00:39:16,898 --> 00:39:19,335
- We must root out
all weakness

614
00:39:19,379 --> 00:39:23,339
so that you can gain power
in this world.

615
00:39:23,383 --> 00:39:26,647
- Were there any other
Kryptonians sent to join me?

616
00:39:28,344 --> 00:39:30,999
There's that weakness.

617
00:39:31,043 --> 00:39:32,958
You need no one, son.

618
00:39:33,001 --> 00:39:35,047
Only me. Is that understood?

619
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:36,526
- Yes, sir.

620
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:39,616
- The first lesson
is the measure of pain.

621
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:44,143
Its application being a tool
of great strategic value.

622
00:39:44,186 --> 00:39:47,102
Although, in your case,

623
00:39:47,146 --> 00:39:51,585
it is necessary that you
be able to withstand it.

624
00:40:01,334 --> 00:40:05,425
Here he is, Father.
- Son of Jor-El.

625
00:40:05,468 --> 00:40:08,689
The worst of Krypton.

626
00:40:08,732 --> 00:40:12,606
- You don't have to do this.
- See how he begs?

627
00:40:12,649 --> 00:40:15,696
His own weakness
never stamped out.

628
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:18,742
- He has vowed
his submission, Father.

629
00:40:18,786 --> 00:40:23,138
- And the Eradicator?
- Taken from his possession.

630
00:40:23,182 --> 00:40:26,185
- Then let us begin.

631
00:41:06,268 --> 00:41:08,967
- John, it's happening.

632
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:10,142
Just like you said it would.

633
00:41:12,579 --> 00:41:14,973
I think
Superman's been turned.

634
00:41:15,219 --> 00:41:40,219
- Greg, move your head.
