<i>My most vivid memories</i>

3
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,242
<i>are of the days when my life changed.</i>

4
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:24,079
I remember coming to this Earth,

5
00:00:24,148 --> 00:00:26,382
feeling the sun on my
face for the first time.

6
00:00:26,451 --> 00:00:27,984
Oh, my God, Jonathan.

7
00:00:28,053 --> 00:00:29,252
It's a baby boy.

8
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:30,920
Hold on, Martha.

9
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,922
Hearing the voices of my parents.

10
00:00:41,566 --> 00:00:43,233
Are you gonna join us?

11
00:00:45,169 --> 00:00:48,704
My mother called me
their greatest surprise.

12
00:00:50,074 --> 00:00:53,776
And boy, there sure were lots of them.

13
00:00:54,068 --> 00:00:55,035
SMALLVILLE HARVEST FESTIVAL

14
00:00:55,047 --> 00:00:57,079
I remember loving Smallville...

15
00:00:57,148 --> 00:00:59,849
the people, the community,

16
00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:02,018
how the small things
were the big things.

17
00:01:02,086 --> 00:01:04,220
And I thought I'd live there forever.

18
00:01:04,289 --> 00:01:05,555
- Dad?
- Jonathan?

19
00:01:05,624 --> 00:01:07,890
- Dad! Dad!
- Jonathan!

20
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:10,460
Dad, wake up! Somebody call 911!

21
00:01:13,165 --> 00:01:17,199
But my father's death
set me on a different path.

22
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:20,903
Eventually, I moved to Metropolis

23
00:01:20,972 --> 00:01:24,306
to become who I was meant to be.

24
00:01:43,428 --> 00:01:44,360
There you go, friend.

25
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:46,796
Thanks. Cool costume.

26
00:01:46,864 --> 00:01:49,165
Thanks. My mom made it for me.

27
00:01:50,134 --> 00:01:53,169
But my most vivid memory of all

28
00:01:53,237 --> 00:01:54,604
was the day I met her.

29
00:01:54,672 --> 00:01:56,238
Everyone in here, we're the most

30
00:01:56,308 --> 00:01:58,241
dependable friends the
people of Metropolis have.

31
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,909
- You remember that.
- Uh, yes, sir.

32
00:01:59,977 --> 00:02:02,412
Stick with Lane. She'll
show you the ropes.

33
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,047
Uh, Lane, sir?

34
00:02:05,116 --> 00:02:06,983
Who told you to wear a tie?

35
00:02:12,356 --> 00:02:15,525
Let me guess. Lombard? Ignore him.

36
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:18,193
Though he can get box
seats to the Meteors.

37
00:02:18,262 --> 00:02:20,563
- You like baseball?
- Uh, uh, of course.

38
00:02:20,632 --> 00:02:23,533
I mean, who doesn't like
America's pastime, Miss Lane?

39
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,767
It's Lois.

40
00:02:24,836 --> 00:02:26,125
What'd you say your name was again?

41
00:02:26,137 --> 00:02:27,937
Uh, Kent. Clark. Clark Kent.

42
00:02:29,741 --> 00:02:31,374
Sorry.

43
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,643
Hmm. Never met a Clark before.

44
00:02:33,711 --> 00:02:36,646
Oh, uh, I've never met a Lois before.

45
00:02:36,714 --> 00:02:38,180
- Thanks.
- Actually, there was

46
00:02:38,249 --> 00:02:39,769
my first-grade teacher, Lois Hannigan,

47
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,173
so I guess technically...
oh, tech... technically,

48
00:02:41,185 --> 00:02:42,451
you'd be the second.

49
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,286
We fell in love.

50
00:02:44,356 --> 00:02:46,656
I told Lois who I really was,

51
00:02:46,725 --> 00:02:48,023
where I came from.

52
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:19,722
We married,

53
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,958
got our first place together...

54
00:03:23,728 --> 00:03:25,428
The twins came.

55
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:28,665
They were as different as brothers get.

56
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:30,633
Look out!

57
00:03:30,702 --> 00:03:32,702
Jonathan was easy.

58
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:35,872
Always happy, always smiling.

59
00:03:38,722 --> 00:03:39,781
Yeah!

60
00:03:41,703 --> 00:03:43,713
Good job, babe!

61
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:49,686
And things with Jordan
were more... challenging.

62
00:03:49,754 --> 00:03:52,222
- Jordan? Stop it.
- Tantrums, night terrors.

63
00:03:54,392 --> 00:03:59,094
A year ago, he was diagnosed
with social anxiety disorder.

SUPERMAN SAVES THE STACK

67
00:04:08,072 --> 00:04:11,273
And suddenly, here I am,

68
00:04:11,342 --> 00:04:14,977
living in Metropolis,
raising two teenage boys,

69
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:19,172
married to the most famous
journalist in the world...

70
00:04:19,184 --> 00:04:22,336
Trying to make the world
safer for the people I love.

NUCLEAR REACTOR MELTING DOWN

72
00:04:33,831 --> 00:04:37,066
Here, here. Here!

73
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,337
Hey! Hey, hey!

74
00:04:41,405 --> 00:04:43,640
How long we got before
this thing pops its top?

75
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,708
- A few minutes, tops.
- The fallout?

76
00:04:45,777 --> 00:04:47,343
As far as Metropolis.

77
00:04:49,113 --> 00:04:50,446
Come on, Superman.

78
00:04:51,783 --> 00:04:53,182
The heat exchanger's offline.

79
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,650
Where's the damn water tanker?

80
00:05:15,073 --> 00:05:16,806
His cold breath isn't gonna fix it.

81
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,674
We need water back
in the reactor vessel,

82
00:05:18,743 --> 00:05:20,823
or we're gonna have a
meltdown the size of Fukushima.

83
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:22,512
- It's out of water!
- Tanks!

CRITICAL MELTDOWN

STABILIZED

00:06:46,664 --> 00:06:48,363
It's cooling down.

-DIFUNDE LA CULTURA-

88
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,533
It's just like Oyster Creek.

89
00:07:24,602 --> 00:07:26,235
Same kind of crack in the cooling tower.

90
00:07:26,303 --> 00:07:29,031
How is it no one at
either plant saw anything?

91
00:07:29,043 --> 00:07:30,475
I don't know yet.

92
00:07:30,544 --> 00:07:33,245
But you can't get
equipment in here unnoticed.

93
00:07:33,314 --> 00:07:34,513
Both cracks were man-made.

94
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:36,882
That's what concerns me.

95
00:07:38,152 --> 00:07:41,220
You've been putting
in a lot of OT lately.

96
00:07:41,288 --> 00:07:43,755
My daughter okay with that?

97
00:07:43,824 --> 00:07:45,691
She's not the one I
have to worry about.

98
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,195
Bass are gonna
start biting again soon.

99
00:07:49,263 --> 00:07:51,430
Was thinking I'd take Jonathan fishing.

100
00:07:51,498 --> 00:07:53,698
Maybe even get Jordan to come this time.

101
00:07:53,767 --> 00:07:56,268
I'll talk to Lois about some dates.

102
00:07:56,337 --> 00:07:57,536
Night, General.

103
00:08:12,887 --> 00:08:15,621
And the delivery truck
crashed into your car?

104
00:08:17,158 --> 00:08:18,824
It was an unmarked box truck?

105
00:08:18,893 --> 00:08:20,592
Can you hold on one sec?

106
00:08:21,963 --> 00:08:24,329
I gotta get Foswell copy
first thing in the morning.

107
00:08:24,398 --> 00:08:25,297
Okay.

108
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:26,388
Your plate's in the fridge,

109
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,332
Jonathan's got some news,

110
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:28,401
and apologize to Jordan;

111
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:30,569
You missed therapy today.

112
00:08:30,638 --> 00:08:32,904
Sorry about that. Yeah...

113
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:40,312
Well, how do you know who she is?

114
00:08:40,381 --> 00:08:41,780
- Come in.
- You've never met her.

115
00:08:41,848 --> 00:08:43,048
- Hey.
- Hey!

116
00:08:43,117 --> 00:08:44,273
What's up? Mom said you had news.

117
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:45,384
Uh, Eliza, one second.

118
00:08:45,452 --> 00:08:46,885
Yeah, um, yeah.

119
00:08:46,954 --> 00:08:48,820
I'm... I'm actually starting QB.

120
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,755
- For varsity?
- Yep.

121
00:08:50,824 --> 00:08:52,491
Yeah, um.

122
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:55,127
Think... think I'm the
first freshman to ever do it,

123
00:08:55,196 --> 00:08:57,696
and some of the upperclassmen
are pretty ticked off.

124
00:08:57,765 --> 00:08:59,798
Oh, don't worry about them.

125
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:02,334
Worry? Nah, it's awesome.
You should've seen their faces.

126
00:09:04,272 --> 00:09:06,004
Um, Dad.

127
00:09:07,074 --> 00:09:09,441
Oh, right, yeah. Okay. Okay.

128
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,809
- Hi, Eliza!
- Hi.

129
00:09:10,878 --> 00:09:12,978
- Hey, congrats.
- Thanks, Dad.

130
00:09:13,047 --> 00:09:14,436
- Proud of you.
- Th... okay, thanks.

131
00:09:14,448 --> 00:09:15,928
- Sorry. I'm out of here.
- All right.

132
00:09:30,731 --> 00:09:32,564
Hey.

133
00:09:37,371 --> 00:09:40,205
Wow, you, uh, you make
a pretty good Superman.

134
00:09:40,274 --> 00:09:43,442
Superman's boring. I'm Raiden.

135
00:09:47,748 --> 00:09:49,181
Sorry I...

136
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,951
I missed our therapy today.

137
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:54,886
Um, I was in Wichita for a story...

138
00:09:54,956 --> 00:09:56,245
You couldn't catch a flight back.

139
00:09:56,257 --> 00:09:57,923
Mom said.

140
00:09:59,893 --> 00:10:02,961
So, uh, high... high
school starts tomorrow.

141
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:04,363
You, uh, you nervous?

142
00:10:04,432 --> 00:10:06,121
'Cause you know, it's
okay if you're nervous.

143
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:09,000
Um, I know freshman year
was pretty tough for me.

144
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:10,602
Did I... did I ever tell you

145
00:10:10,671 --> 00:10:12,537
about the time I was the
team manager of the...

146
00:10:12,606 --> 00:10:14,229
Yeah, everyone duct
taped you to a tractor.

147
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:16,008
Yeah, life's a little
different in Smallville

148
00:10:16,077 --> 00:10:17,309
than it is in Metropolis.

149
00:10:17,378 --> 00:10:18,944
Okay, well, yeah. You know.

150
00:10:19,013 --> 00:10:23,649
If you... if you need
anything, if you wanna talk...

151
00:10:23,717 --> 00:10:25,384
I'm here.

152
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:35,126
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?

153
00:10:35,196 --> 00:10:36,395
The music?

154
00:10:38,626 --> 00:10:39,698
Right.

155
00:10:56,946 --> 00:10:59,242
MOM - MISSED CALL

156
00:11:17,871 --> 00:11:21,039
I saw you on the news.

157
00:11:21,107 --> 00:11:22,974
Are you just getting home now?

158
00:11:23,043 --> 00:11:24,643
Yeah, a little bit ago.

159
00:11:24,711 --> 00:11:27,312
Honey, I know you've
got a lot on your plate,

160
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,348
but you really do need
to be around more.

161
00:11:30,417 --> 00:11:31,783
Mom, I, uh, you know,

162
00:11:31,852 --> 00:11:34,053
I do have a responsibility to the world

163
00:11:34,121 --> 00:11:36,221
as you-know-who.

164
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:38,857
Well, you've got a
bigger responsibility

165
00:11:38,925 --> 00:11:41,793
to your family as a father.

166
00:11:41,862 --> 00:11:44,730
The boys need to see
what a strong and loving

167
00:11:44,798 --> 00:11:47,799
and vulnerable man looks like...

168
00:11:47,868 --> 00:11:50,302
what your father was to you.

169
00:11:51,872 --> 00:11:54,072
You only have them
for a short while longer

170
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,241
before they go off into the world.

171
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,310
You gotta be present.

172
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:01,680
I'm trying.

173
00:12:01,748 --> 00:12:03,014
I really am.

174
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,350
I don't wanna let anybody down.

175
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:06,618
Was it, um...

176
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:11,056
Was it always this hard for you and Dad?

177
00:12:11,124 --> 00:12:13,425
Your lives are so
much more complicated

178
00:12:13,494 --> 00:12:14,893
than ours ever were.

179
00:12:14,961 --> 00:12:16,228
Besides,

180
00:12:16,297 --> 00:12:20,365
life's a little different in
Smallville, remember?

181
00:12:23,504 --> 00:12:24,769
You okay?

182
00:12:24,838 --> 00:12:26,872
I just need to lie down, that's all.

183
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,408
Get some sleep, Mom.

184
00:12:29,476 --> 00:12:30,408
I love you.

185
00:12:30,477 --> 00:12:32,143
Good night, honey.

186
00:12:32,212 --> 00:12:33,212
Night.

187
00:12:48,295 --> 00:12:49,718
- Get 'em while they're hot.
- Thanks.

188
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,863
- More juice?
- Uh, I think I'm good.

189
00:12:51,932 --> 00:12:52,964
Thank you.

190
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:54,633
Little help?

191
00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:57,035
Your mom called while you
were in the shower about a visit.

192
00:12:57,103 --> 00:12:59,905
- Are we going to Grandma's?
- I think we're overdue.

193
00:12:59,973 --> 00:13:01,573
Great. Smallville.

194
00:13:01,642 --> 00:13:03,632
A place where you can spend
a full year in one afternoon.

195
00:13:03,644 --> 00:13:05,677
It's not that bad.

196
00:13:07,448 --> 00:13:08,680
Whoa.

197
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:10,582
Is that how you're going dressed today?

198
00:13:10,651 --> 00:13:12,331
Somebody got the
punch-me-in-the-face memo.

199
00:13:12,385 --> 00:13:13,785
Yeah, I should dress like you?

200
00:13:13,854 --> 00:13:15,410
Like some sort of human
participation trophy?

201
00:13:15,422 --> 00:13:16,921
No, but you could watch a, like,

202
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,258
"HowToBasic" video on style.

203
00:13:19,326 --> 00:13:21,660
Enough. Both of you, go.

204
00:13:21,728 --> 00:13:23,027
Your ride's here.

205
00:13:25,283 --> 00:13:26,334
Bye.

206
00:13:27,501 --> 00:13:29,000
- Love you guys.
- Love you.

207
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:30,589
- Good luck today, guys.
- Thanks, Dad.

208
00:13:30,637 --> 00:13:31,770
Yeah.

209
00:13:37,344 --> 00:13:39,243
You're worried about Jordan.

210
00:13:39,312 --> 00:13:40,845
I tried talking to him last night,

211
00:13:40,914 --> 00:13:42,213
but he was pretty upset.

212
00:13:42,282 --> 00:13:44,883
Well, if he knew
where you really were...

213
00:13:44,952 --> 00:13:46,251
your parents told you

214
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,542
about your real heritage
when you were six.

215
00:13:47,554 --> 00:13:48,794
That was... that was different.

216
00:13:48,855 --> 00:13:50,522
I lived on a farm. I had powers.

217
00:13:50,591 --> 00:13:52,691
You don't think
Jonathan's got something?

218
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,425
Test at the fortress
said it was unlikely.

219
00:13:54,494 --> 00:13:56,261
He's about to be starting quarterback

220
00:13:56,329 --> 00:13:58,689
at one of the most competitive
high schools in the nation...

221
00:13:58,732 --> 00:14:00,264
as a freshman.

222
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,901
Yeah. Doesn't mean he has powers.

223
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,936
Have you seen him throw a deep route?

224
00:14:06,373 --> 00:14:08,106
And what about Jordan?

225
00:14:08,175 --> 00:14:10,309
All it's gonna do is
make him feel more alien

226
00:14:10,377 --> 00:14:11,743
than he already does.

227
00:14:11,812 --> 00:14:13,679
Trust me, I've been there.

228
00:14:15,315 --> 00:14:16,515
We're late.

229
00:14:16,584 --> 00:14:18,006
It's too dangerous for them to know.

230
00:14:18,018 --> 00:14:19,378
It's more dangerous if they don't.

231
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,319
But Lois, they slip up once,

232
00:14:21,388 --> 00:14:23,254
say the wrong thing to one person,

233
00:14:23,323 --> 00:14:25,457
the whole world knows who I am.

234
00:14:27,394 --> 00:14:28,993
What?

235
00:14:29,062 --> 00:14:30,328
Your father agrees with me.

236
00:14:30,397 --> 00:14:33,464
Oh, now we care what my dad thinks?

237
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:37,603
I'm just saying, they're 14.

238
00:14:37,671 --> 00:14:39,671
They don't need to know yet.

239
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,240
Maxy, what's going on?

240
00:14:42,308 --> 00:14:44,576
Whit... fired.

241
00:14:44,645 --> 00:14:46,011
More layoffs?

242
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,636
I knew when Morgan
Edge bought the "Planet,"

243
00:14:47,648 --> 00:14:50,114
there'd be cuts, but
this is unbelievable.

244
00:14:50,183 --> 00:14:51,315
Kent!

245
00:14:52,386 --> 00:14:53,685
You got a minute?

246
00:14:56,056 --> 00:14:57,455
Foswell fired you?

247
00:14:57,524 --> 00:14:59,724
It's better me than
somebody else, okay?

248
00:14:59,793 --> 00:15:02,026
- I do have another day job.
- That's not the point!

249
00:15:02,095 --> 00:15:04,963
Foswell's no editor;
He's a patsy for Edge.

250
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:07,032
All these billionaires
that buy media outlets

251
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,420
use this "moving to digital" crap

252
00:15:08,435 --> 00:15:09,968
as an excuse to destroy journalism,

253
00:15:10,037 --> 00:15:11,917
and they don't care about
human interest stories

254
00:15:11,939 --> 00:15:13,171
or facts.

255
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,740
All they care about is click-throughs.

256
00:15:23,517 --> 00:15:24,717
You're gonna need a new excuse

257
00:15:24,785 --> 00:15:25,940
for being gone all the time now.

258
00:15:25,952 --> 00:15:27,552
Lois.

259
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,721
We're not telling the boys.

260
00:15:31,392 --> 00:15:34,493
Hey, Mom, sorry. This
morning's just been...

261
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:37,529
Dr. Frye?

262
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:55,447
Clark?

263
00:15:55,516 --> 00:15:57,015
How did you...

264
00:16:00,353 --> 00:16:02,978
The stroke...

265
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,323
It...

266
00:17:05,746 --> 00:17:07,412
Faithful God,

267
00:17:07,481 --> 00:17:09,280
Lord of all creation,

268
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:11,069
you desire that nothing
redeemed by your Son

269
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:13,184
will ever be lost,

270
00:17:13,254 --> 00:17:17,055
as we return the ashes
of our sister to the earth

271
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:20,124
to live with you and all your children

272
00:17:20,193 --> 00:17:23,094
forever and ever.

273
00:17:23,163 --> 00:17:24,562
Amen.

274
00:17:33,506 --> 00:17:34,706
Clark!

275
00:17:55,329 --> 00:17:56,895
- What's that?
- It's 1:00.

276
00:17:56,964 --> 00:17:59,430
Don't you need to take
your pill with something?

277
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,032
Who are you? Mom?

278
00:18:01,101 --> 00:18:02,467
Someone's gotta watch out for you.

279
00:18:02,536 --> 00:18:04,503
Now, Clark here and his dad?

280
00:18:04,571 --> 00:18:07,806
They could harvest crops
faster than any farm in the area.

281
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,540
How's your place, Mr. Branden?

282
00:18:09,609 --> 00:18:12,210
We had to sell to
Oberlee Foods last year.

283
00:18:12,278 --> 00:18:13,545
I'm really sorry to hear that.

284
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:15,046
It's hard for family farmers

285
00:18:15,115 --> 00:18:16,948
to make it around here nowadays.

286
00:18:18,585 --> 00:18:20,418
What are you doing?

287
00:18:20,487 --> 00:18:22,087
Come on, sweetie. Keep up.

288
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:32,130
Remember that girl from
that summer we stayed here?

289
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,300
- Sarah Cushing?
- Yeah.

290
00:18:35,368 --> 00:18:36,801
She's here.

291
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,969
Really? Where?

292
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:39,470
50 yards and approaching.

293
00:18:50,684 --> 00:18:52,117
If you hurry,

294
00:18:52,185 --> 00:18:55,887
you'll have time to go
inside and change into...

295
00:18:57,257 --> 00:18:59,290
A completely different person.

296
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:07,799
Clark, I'm so sorry.

297
00:19:07,868 --> 00:19:09,734
She was always so kind to me.

298
00:19:09,803 --> 00:19:11,970
To all of us.

299
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:13,972
- It's good to see you, Lana.
- Same.

300
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,075
Lois, it's great to see you.

301
00:19:17,143 --> 00:19:18,977
I'm sorry it's under
these circumstances.

302
00:19:19,045 --> 00:19:21,780
It's nice to see you too.

303
00:19:21,848 --> 00:19:24,182
You remember our boys,
Jonathan and Jordan.

304
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,484
- Hi.
- Hey.

305
00:19:25,552 --> 00:19:26,718
These are our girls.

306
00:19:26,787 --> 00:19:29,120
The littlest one here is Sophie.

307
00:19:29,189 --> 00:19:30,555
And, uh,

308
00:19:30,623 --> 00:19:32,591
well, the one with the
perma-scowl over there,

309
00:19:32,659 --> 00:19:33,758
that's Sarah.

310
00:19:33,827 --> 00:19:35,193
Hi.

311
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:36,727
I'm really sorry about your grandma.

312
00:19:36,797 --> 00:19:38,463
She was really special.

313
00:19:38,531 --> 00:19:42,133
Even my dad liked her,
and he hates everyone, so.

314
00:19:43,637 --> 00:19:45,170
House full of girls.

315
00:19:45,238 --> 00:19:47,505
Someone's always pissed at you.

316
00:19:47,574 --> 00:19:48,873
- Mommy.
- Mm-hmm?

317
00:19:48,942 --> 00:19:50,475
That's him.

318
00:19:50,543 --> 00:19:51,742
Well, your daddy and I

319
00:19:51,812 --> 00:19:53,578
went to high school with Mr. Kent.

320
00:19:53,647 --> 00:19:54,813
You dated him.

321
00:19:54,881 --> 00:19:56,147
That's why Daddy got mad

322
00:19:56,216 --> 00:19:58,850
when he saw you on his Facebook page.

323
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,086
Okay, sweets, why don't you go play?

324
00:20:04,825 --> 00:20:07,492
How are you holding up?

325
00:20:07,561 --> 00:20:09,660
I could really use a drink, actually.

326
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:11,562
See, now you're talking.

327
00:20:11,632 --> 00:20:12,997
Lead the way.

328
00:20:14,334 --> 00:20:15,834
Be good.

329
00:20:18,371 --> 00:20:20,171
I didn't think you guys
would've remembered me

330
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,739
from that summer.

331
00:20:21,808 --> 00:20:24,109
Of course we would, I mean, y...

332
00:20:24,177 --> 00:20:26,978
but you changed your everything.

333
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,180
What my brother's trying to say is

334
00:20:29,249 --> 00:20:31,516
that whatever you're doing is...

335
00:20:31,585 --> 00:20:32,951
it's totally working for you.

336
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,554
Well, we still get
puberty in Smallville.

337
00:20:36,623 --> 00:20:38,857
Although cell service sucks, so.

338
00:20:38,925 --> 00:20:40,992
Yeah, no, I've been
trying to get on all morning.

339
00:20:41,061 --> 00:20:42,717
I think there's something
wrong with the router.

340
00:20:42,729 --> 00:20:44,929
Just probably needs to be reset.

341
00:20:44,998 --> 00:20:46,197
Jon, it's in the barn.

342
00:20:47,634 --> 00:20:50,134
Ooh, mysterious. What's in the barn?

343
00:20:50,203 --> 00:20:51,602
Our dad doesn't like us in there.

344
00:20:51,671 --> 00:20:53,061
He says it's full of
stuff that can kill us.

345
00:20:53,073 --> 00:20:54,295
Yeah, when we were, like, eight.

346
00:20:54,307 --> 00:20:56,775
Well, as a member of the FFA,

347
00:20:56,843 --> 00:20:59,911
I think I can keep you guys safe.

348
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,080
What's the FFA?

349
00:21:02,148 --> 00:21:03,148
I don't know.

350
00:21:03,216 --> 00:21:04,483
Your daughters are so gorgeous.

351
00:21:04,551 --> 00:21:06,051
Aw, thank you.

352
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:09,453
You look exactly the same
as you did in high school.

353
00:21:09,522 --> 00:21:11,489
He... he doesn't age.

354
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:13,224
It's, uh, good genes, I guess.

355
00:21:13,293 --> 00:21:15,593
And Lois, I read all your stories.

356
00:21:15,662 --> 00:21:17,228
I mean, it's so impressive.

357
00:21:17,297 --> 00:21:19,898
'Cause of you, I tell my
girls they can do anything.

358
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:22,467
Thank you. Are you still at the bank?

359
00:21:22,536 --> 00:21:24,669
Yep, and Kyle's
still at the firehouse,

360
00:21:24,737 --> 00:21:26,337
made fire chief last year,

361
00:21:26,406 --> 00:21:28,473
and everybody else we knew moved away.

362
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:30,108
She means "bailed."

363
00:21:31,144 --> 00:21:32,510
- Lueck?
- Twin Cities.

364
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:34,679
- Sippy?
- St. Louis.

365
00:21:34,748 --> 00:21:36,814
Maybe you'll see
them at the next reunion.

366
00:21:36,883 --> 00:21:39,084
Kent didn't make it to
the last one, now, did he?

367
00:21:39,152 --> 00:21:40,719
Ah, I was supposed to, but we, uh...

368
00:21:40,787 --> 00:21:42,476
You know, it used to be
that when folks move away

369
00:21:42,488 --> 00:21:44,122
to get their degrees, well,

370
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,856
they bring their skills back home,

371
00:21:45,926 --> 00:21:49,294
take care of the community's
help raised them, you know?

372
00:21:49,362 --> 00:21:51,296
That ain't happening anymore.

373
00:21:55,068 --> 00:21:57,202
Well, hey, we'll at least get a lifeline

374
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,604
if this whole Edge proposal
goes through, right?

375
00:21:59,672 --> 00:22:01,352
What does Morgan
Edge want with Smallville?

376
00:22:01,408 --> 00:22:02,673
Oh, boy.

377
00:22:02,743 --> 00:22:04,275
He's retrofitting the coal mines

378
00:22:04,344 --> 00:22:06,610
to produce alternative energies.

379
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:08,669
It's gonna put a lot of folks
back to work around here.

380
00:22:08,681 --> 00:22:10,214
- Until it doesn't.
- Lois.

381
00:22:10,283 --> 00:22:12,783
Morgan Edge ruins
everything he touches.

382
00:22:12,852 --> 00:22:14,285
What's he ruined?

383
00:22:14,354 --> 00:22:17,022
He is single-handedly
destroying the "Daily Planet."

384
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,323
People quit reading that paper

385
00:22:18,391 --> 00:22:19,658
'cause, uh, you reporters

386
00:22:19,726 --> 00:22:21,326
can't keep your politics to yourselves.

387
00:22:21,394 --> 00:22:23,995
Edge's companies prey
on struggling communities.

388
00:22:24,064 --> 00:22:26,965
He busts up unions. He
barely pays a living wage.

389
00:22:27,033 --> 00:22:29,534
I don't understand how
he can keep fooling people.

390
00:22:29,602 --> 00:22:32,270
Oh, you mean us dumb,
backwards, small-town folk?

391
00:22:32,338 --> 00:22:34,806
No, no, that is not what I meant.

392
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,607
I know what you meant.

393
00:22:38,311 --> 00:22:40,679
See, people like you,
you look at Smallville,

394
00:22:40,747 --> 00:22:42,113
and you think of the past,

395
00:22:42,182 --> 00:22:43,705
and you feel a little bad for us, right?

396
00:22:43,717 --> 00:22:45,449
People like Morgan Edge, though,

397
00:22:45,518 --> 00:22:47,218
now, see, he looks at Smallville,

398
00:22:47,287 --> 00:22:49,354
and he sees the future.

399
00:22:49,422 --> 00:22:51,022
It's not a future I
would wanna live in.

400
00:22:51,091 --> 00:22:52,413
It's a good thing
we don't have to worry

401
00:22:52,425 --> 00:22:53,958
about that anymore, now, do we?

402
00:22:54,027 --> 00:22:57,262
We haven't made any
decisions about the farm yet, Kyle.

403
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,463
But your mother has.

404
00:23:01,334 --> 00:23:02,733
What does that mean?

405
00:23:02,803 --> 00:23:04,736
Kyle, go get the girls.

406
00:23:10,811 --> 00:23:12,643
I'm sorry for your loss, Kent.

407
00:23:19,586 --> 00:23:22,186
Lana? What's he talking about?

408
00:23:22,255 --> 00:23:25,089
Your mother had some
business with us, that's all.

409
00:23:27,627 --> 00:23:30,295
Come by the bank tomorrow.

410
00:23:30,363 --> 00:23:33,164
Martha was a great lady.

411
00:23:33,233 --> 00:23:35,466
The heart of Smallville, really.

412
00:23:35,535 --> 00:23:37,535
I'm sorry she's gone.

413
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,910
Yeah, your dad's right.

414
00:23:45,978 --> 00:23:48,179
Pretty much everything
here can kill you.

415
00:23:49,516 --> 00:23:51,582
- What's that thing?
- Oh, that's a hay raker.

416
00:23:51,651 --> 00:23:53,151
I guess you guys don't see
much of this in Metropolis.

417
00:23:53,163 --> 00:23:54,753
No, but our dad
told us all these stories

418
00:23:54,765 --> 00:23:56,865
about growing up here.

419
00:23:56,934 --> 00:23:58,434
Tell you it sucks?

420
00:23:58,502 --> 00:24:01,670
Actually, I think he kinda loved it.

421
00:24:01,739 --> 00:24:03,271
Can't be that bad.

422
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,397
I mean, it's more the people
that make up a place, right?

423
00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:06,908
Wow.

424
00:24:06,977 --> 00:24:08,934
Metropolis boys are really
starting to lose their game.

425
00:24:08,946 --> 00:24:10,746
Relax. I'm... I'm taken.

426
00:24:10,815 --> 00:24:12,648
I didn't mean it like
that. I'm just saying...

427
00:24:12,716 --> 00:24:15,350
well, I guess I'm trying to say that

428
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:16,719
we're only here for a few days,

429
00:24:16,787 --> 00:24:18,854
and I figure that we kinda need

430
00:24:18,922 --> 00:24:20,656
someone to show us around.

431
00:24:23,661 --> 00:24:25,628
Okay. Uh, phone.

432
00:24:25,696 --> 00:24:27,929
Oh, no, not you.

433
00:24:32,436 --> 00:24:33,802
You.

434
00:24:36,606 --> 00:24:39,007
Thank you. Uh...

435
00:24:40,511 --> 00:24:42,277
There's a bonfire tomorrow

436
00:24:42,345 --> 00:24:44,446
at the old Shuster Mine.

437
00:24:44,515 --> 00:24:47,015
Hit me up if you wanna
go, but I can't guarantee

438
00:24:47,084 --> 00:24:49,151
I won't get you into
a little bit of trouble.

439
00:24:51,221 --> 00:24:53,589
Guys. Found the router.

440
00:24:54,174 --> 00:24:57,059
What the hell was Grandma
thinking, putting it up there?

441
00:24:57,127 --> 00:24:58,327
I got it.

442
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:04,266
Oh, Jordan, be careful.

443
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,003
"Come by the bank"?

444
00:25:08,071 --> 00:25:10,172
I wonder what that was all about.

445
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,540
I shouldn't have lost my cool with Kyle.

446
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:14,276
You think he's right?

447
00:25:14,344 --> 00:25:16,912
Should I have come back
to Smallville more often?

448
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,247
No, Clark, he's not right.

449
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:22,384
Your mom knew where
you were and who you were.

450
00:25:25,956 --> 00:25:28,290
Right before she died, I...

451
00:25:30,494 --> 00:25:33,228
I heard her say something
as I was flying here.

452
00:25:37,902 --> 00:25:39,567
It's time.

453
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,803
Come home.

454
00:25:41,872 --> 00:25:44,272
She wanted me to come home.

455
00:25:46,944 --> 00:25:48,944
I just don't know why yet.

456
00:25:54,684 --> 00:25:55,984
Careful.

457
00:25:57,554 --> 00:26:00,022
- Still not working.
- Got it.

458
00:26:11,367 --> 00:26:12,934
Oh, my God.

459
00:26:16,662 --> 00:26:17,894
Help! Somebody help!

460
00:26:18,473 --> 00:26:21,532
Help! The boys! They're hurt!

461
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,819
Go get medical supplies.

462
00:26:38,337 --> 00:26:41,371
It was his idea.

463
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,306
It's okay.

464
00:26:45,811 --> 00:26:48,344
You're saying all we
have are mild concussions?

465
00:26:48,413 --> 00:26:50,513
You're both really lucky.

466
00:26:50,582 --> 00:26:53,249
Little rest, should be fine.

467
00:26:53,318 --> 00:26:54,785
- Thanks, Benny.
- Yeah.

468
00:26:54,853 --> 00:26:56,276
- It's good to see you.
- No worries. Thank you.

469
00:26:56,288 --> 00:26:57,921
- Best to the family.
- Thank you.

470
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,322
I'm sorry for your loss.

471
00:26:59,391 --> 00:27:00,523
Thanks.

472
00:27:02,361 --> 00:27:03,794
Come on, boys. Let's get upstairs.

473
00:27:03,862 --> 00:27:05,495
You've had a long day.

474
00:27:22,747 --> 00:27:25,115
Great, Engstrom just said
that I might not be starting

475
00:27:25,184 --> 00:27:28,051
anymore 'cause I
missed practice all week.

476
00:27:29,054 --> 00:27:30,821
Seriously?

477
00:27:30,889 --> 00:27:32,888
Football's what you're
worried about right now?

478
00:27:34,526 --> 00:27:36,860
How are we fine, Jon?

479
00:27:37,695 --> 00:27:40,863
Jordan, look, if you wanna
fixate on something weird,

480
00:27:40,932 --> 00:27:43,599
maybe you should start
thinking about how Sarah Cushing

481
00:27:43,668 --> 00:27:45,468
gave you her digits and not me.

482
00:27:46,805 --> 00:27:49,039
You texted her already, didn't you?

483
00:27:50,409 --> 00:27:51,842
I don't know. Wha...

484
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,633
I just wanted her to know
we were okay, all right?

485
00:27:53,645 --> 00:27:55,345
What is this? You sent
a waving hand emoji?

486
00:27:55,414 --> 00:27:57,179
Okay, no, that is a Vulcan salute.

487
00:27:57,249 --> 00:27:59,915
I gotta say, that's even worse.

488
00:27:59,984 --> 00:28:01,717
You're kind of a freak.

489
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,254
You know what?

490
00:28:04,323 --> 00:28:05,721
Something a lot freakier than me

491
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,590
happened to us in that barn.

492
00:28:07,659 --> 00:28:10,193
Something we're not being told about.

493
00:28:10,262 --> 00:28:13,996
And it's up to us to
find out what that is.

494
00:28:15,868 --> 00:28:17,500
Okay.

495
00:28:17,569 --> 00:28:18,601
Whatever, weirdo.

496
00:28:40,459 --> 00:28:41,924
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

497
00:28:41,993 --> 00:28:44,360
Jonathan must have
somehow shielded them both?

498
00:28:44,429 --> 00:28:46,929
You saw how confused they are.

499
00:28:46,998 --> 00:28:48,331
They need to know the truth.

500
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,766
What is the truth gonna do to Jordan?

501
00:28:50,835 --> 00:28:52,635
It's hard enough on him having a brother

502
00:28:52,704 --> 00:28:55,571
that everything comes easy to,
but having one that has powers?

503
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,872
Like Superman?

504
00:28:56,941 --> 00:29:00,176
We don't know what
he can or can't do yet.

505
00:29:01,446 --> 00:29:03,646
And yes, it will be hard for him,

506
00:29:03,715 --> 00:29:05,035
but he will have his family there

507
00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:06,749
to help him figure things out

508
00:29:06,818 --> 00:29:08,050
like he does right now.

509
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,852
I can't lose him, Lois.

510
00:29:11,123 --> 00:29:12,555
I can't.

511
00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:17,660
He's pulled so far away from me already.

512
00:29:26,338 --> 00:29:28,204
When we were dreaming
about having a family,

513
00:29:28,273 --> 00:29:30,907
it didn't look like this, did it?

514
00:29:30,976 --> 00:29:33,409
Didn't have lost jobs or...

515
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,713
Teens with severe anxiety or...

516
00:29:39,484 --> 00:29:41,751
Parents gone too soon.

517
00:29:46,858 --> 00:29:48,558
No one ever dreams about the problems,

518
00:29:48,626 --> 00:29:51,561
but every life has them.

519
00:29:51,629 --> 00:29:54,063
Even the extraordinary ones.

520
00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:05,841
Your dad's back.

521
00:30:07,912 --> 00:30:09,545
That's not good.

522
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:14,484
Had my team analyze
security camera footage

523
00:30:14,553 --> 00:30:17,520
from both nuclear plants
where the ruptures occurred,

524
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:21,290
and this is the only commonality.

525
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:23,193
Whatever did this, it's moving fast.

526
00:30:23,261 --> 00:30:25,428
That's not all.

527
00:30:25,497 --> 00:30:27,964
We also discovered a
sub-microscopic etching

528
00:30:28,033 --> 00:30:29,399
at both sites.

529
00:30:29,467 --> 00:30:32,368
Thought maybe it
was a fingerprint at first.

530
00:30:33,905 --> 00:30:35,238
It wasn't.

531
00:30:36,975 --> 00:30:38,374
It's Kryptonian.

532
00:30:38,443 --> 00:30:40,843
"You are not a hero, Kal-El."

533
00:30:40,912 --> 00:30:42,378
Whoever did this knows who I am.

534
00:30:42,447 --> 00:30:44,013
He's studying you, Clark.

535
00:30:44,082 --> 00:30:45,648
Now, I'm sure there's a phone booth

536
00:30:45,717 --> 00:30:48,518
in this Podunk town
where you can suit up.

537
00:30:48,586 --> 00:30:50,553
Now? No.

538
00:30:50,622 --> 00:30:52,722
Lois.

539
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,056
I get it.

540
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:55,925
There is a powerful something out there

541
00:30:55,994 --> 00:30:58,628
that doesn't like Superman
or nuclear power plants,

542
00:30:58,696 --> 00:31:00,329
and that is a bad combo.

543
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:03,399
But now is not a moment
Clark can just take off.

544
00:31:03,468 --> 00:31:05,535
His mom just died.

545
00:31:05,604 --> 00:31:07,337
I mean it, Clark.

546
00:31:09,307 --> 00:31:12,842
The world will always need Superman,

547
00:31:12,911 --> 00:31:14,900
and when there is a problem,
you will be there for them,

548
00:31:14,912 --> 00:31:17,647
but right now, this
family needs you more.

549
00:31:21,385 --> 00:31:22,552
She's right, Sam.

550
00:31:33,331 --> 00:31:35,331
- I tried to warn you, Lois.
- Come on, Dad.

551
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,456
When you wanted to get married,

552
00:31:36,468 --> 00:31:38,501
I tried warning you.

553
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:41,371
You may have fallen
in love with Clark Kent,

554
00:31:41,439 --> 00:31:43,873
but you married Superman.

555
00:31:43,941 --> 00:31:46,609
And Superman doesn't
get to have a normal life,

556
00:31:46,678 --> 00:31:49,379
no matter how much you want one for him.

557
00:31:50,948 --> 00:31:52,449
Or yourself.

558
00:32:17,221 --> 00:32:19,088
So how are the boys doing?

559
00:32:19,157 --> 00:32:21,924
They're fine, they're
just a little shaken up.

560
00:32:23,094 --> 00:32:26,028
Ah, it seems luck runs in the family.

561
00:32:26,097 --> 00:32:28,330
Did Clark ever tell
you about our accident

562
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,032
coming home from the
Soul Asylum concert?

563
00:32:30,101 --> 00:32:31,333
Oh, I try not to talk

564
00:32:31,402 --> 00:32:32,802
about my Soul Asylum days too much.

565
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:36,171
So Pete was at the wheel.

566
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,107
Fell asleep, drove off the road.

567
00:32:38,176 --> 00:32:40,910
We came to. The car was a pretzel.

568
00:32:40,978 --> 00:32:43,312
Nobody was hurt. Not a scratch.

569
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,514
It was the strangest thing.

570
00:32:45,583 --> 00:32:50,286
Again, lots of strange things
happened here back then.

571
00:32:51,422 --> 00:32:52,955
Okay.

572
00:32:56,693 --> 00:32:57,727
Mortgage papers?

573
00:32:57,795 --> 00:32:59,428
My mom paid hers off years ago.

574
00:32:59,496 --> 00:33:01,097
Her first.

575
00:33:01,165 --> 00:33:02,531
About five years ago,

576
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:04,633
at the peak of the farming crisis,

577
00:33:04,702 --> 00:33:09,238
banks here were offering
reverse mortgages to seniors.

578
00:33:09,306 --> 00:33:11,840
Pay now for the
opportunity to let the bank

579
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:14,576
purchase the remainder
of the farm upon their death

580
00:33:14,645 --> 00:33:16,812
if the landowner's heirs

581
00:33:16,881 --> 00:33:18,547
couldn't repay the balance of the loan.

582
00:33:18,616 --> 00:33:21,383
She... she didn't
need that kind of money.

583
00:33:21,452 --> 00:33:22,551
No.

584
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,019
But...

585
00:33:24,088 --> 00:33:26,955
the Gordons were gonna
be evicted from their farm

586
00:33:27,024 --> 00:33:29,624
that had been in their
family for generations.

587
00:33:29,693 --> 00:33:32,561
Margie Kelton's lung surgery made it

588
00:33:32,629 --> 00:33:34,964
so she could hardly
put food on the table.

589
00:33:35,032 --> 00:33:38,167
I have dozens of stories.

590
00:33:38,236 --> 00:33:41,937
Everyone in town knew
that if you were in trouble,

591
00:33:42,005 --> 00:33:43,739
Martha would be there.

592
00:33:44,741 --> 00:33:47,276
She was like your friend
you always write about, Lois.

593
00:33:47,345 --> 00:33:49,544
She was like this town's Superman.

594
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:51,714
Or Superwoman.

595
00:33:53,351 --> 00:33:54,831
Sounds like they had a lot in common.

596
00:33:54,886 --> 00:33:57,920
She still protected
half the farm's value.

597
00:33:57,989 --> 00:33:59,855
She wanted there to be enough money

598
00:33:59,923 --> 00:34:01,757
to send the boys to college.

599
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:08,797
So you can either repay the loan,

600
00:34:08,866 --> 00:34:11,800
or you can accept a healthy buyout

601
00:34:11,869 --> 00:34:14,636
for the remaining value of the property.

602
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:31,954
You really think Dad's
hiding something from us?

603
00:34:32,023 --> 00:34:34,589
We had all those poles land on us.

604
00:34:34,658 --> 00:34:38,327
Besides, how did he get them
up off of us so fast, anyway?

605
00:34:38,396 --> 00:34:39,829
I don't know. Adrenaline, maybe?

606
00:34:39,897 --> 00:34:42,131
Like a soccer mom
lifting a car kind of thing.

607
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,732
Dad can't put up a Christmas tree

608
00:34:43,801 --> 00:34:45,968
without falling off the ladder.

609
00:34:47,571 --> 00:34:50,872
And what's the thing he says
every single time we come here?

610
00:34:50,941 --> 00:34:52,641
"Don't put your finger in that"?

611
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,808
I don't know.

612
00:34:53,877 --> 00:34:56,378
"Stay out of the barn," dumb-ass.

613
00:34:57,381 --> 00:34:59,348
Jordan, what are we
looking for, anyways?

614
00:34:59,417 --> 00:35:03,252
Just something unusual.
Something out of place.

615
00:35:11,995 --> 00:35:13,395
- What?
- You hear that?

616
00:35:14,965 --> 00:35:18,033
The poles, they must
have shifted the floor.

617
00:35:18,101 --> 00:35:19,701
I think it's a door.

618
00:35:22,173 --> 00:35:23,539
Look. Right there.

619
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:30,479
- Three, two, one.
- Three, two, one.

620
00:35:40,457 --> 00:35:42,658
- Get the flashlight.
- Yeah.

621
00:35:58,342 --> 00:36:01,977
What are you doing?

622
00:36:04,848 --> 00:36:06,715
This is literally just an old cellar.

623
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:10,219
It's probably Grandpa's old
tool storage or something.

624
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:28,037
Jon?

625
00:36:44,571 --> 00:36:45,750
Alright.

626
00:36:58,002 --> 00:36:59,401
What is that thing?

627
00:37:01,205 --> 00:37:02,937
What are you doing? Do not touch that!

628
00:37:04,942 --> 00:37:07,042
Oh, my God.

629
00:37:07,111 --> 00:37:08,444
Did you see that?

630
00:37:08,512 --> 00:37:10,379
Did you see that?
What the hell was that?

631
00:37:10,448 --> 00:37:12,013
No. No, no, no.

632
00:37:12,082 --> 00:37:14,583
What was that? Jordan, what was that?

633
00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:19,721
Jordan, what are you...

634
00:37:31,068 --> 00:37:33,936
What the hell is that thing?

635
00:37:34,005 --> 00:37:35,471
Whatever it is...

636
00:37:36,073 --> 00:37:38,006
It's not from Kansas.

637
00:37:47,196 --> 00:37:49,029
All my memories,

638
00:37:49,098 --> 00:37:53,399
my childhood, my parents...

639
00:37:56,205 --> 00:37:57,370
They're all here.

640
00:37:57,439 --> 00:37:59,106
Why would my mom want me to come home

641
00:37:59,174 --> 00:38:01,307
just to sell the farm?

642
00:38:03,746 --> 00:38:06,580
I don't think she
wanted you to sell it.

643
00:38:06,649 --> 00:38:08,881
I think she wanted you to save it.

644
00:38:08,951 --> 00:38:10,984
How?

645
00:38:11,053 --> 00:38:13,219
You know, we're not
exactly flush with cash,

646
00:38:13,288 --> 00:38:14,721
especially after getting fired.

647
00:38:14,789 --> 00:38:16,256
I don't know yet.

648
00:38:16,324 --> 00:38:17,948
But those reverse
mortgages weren't because

649
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,961
the bank was feeling generous.

650
00:38:21,029 --> 00:38:23,463
You may have super
strength and super hearing,

651
00:38:23,531 --> 00:38:24,765
but I have super smell,

652
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:26,532
and those loans don't smell right.

653
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,076
I do have super smell, by the way.

654
00:38:36,144 --> 00:38:38,278
I just don't use it
very often, you know.

655
00:38:38,347 --> 00:38:40,580
Not with two teenage boys in the house.

656
00:38:40,649 --> 00:38:41,982
Kinda gross.

657
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:44,617
Two very upset teenage boys.

658
00:38:46,221 --> 00:38:47,520
So that's why?

659
00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:49,122
Why you never wanted us in the barn?

660
00:38:49,191 --> 00:38:52,092
'Cause you keep a
freakin' alien ship in there?

661
00:38:52,161 --> 00:38:53,893
- Look, I can explain.
- Yeah, can you?

662
00:38:53,962 --> 00:38:56,696
Can you explain how I fell
30 feet and nothing happened?

663
00:38:56,765 --> 00:38:58,198
- Just give him...
- All you said

664
00:38:58,266 --> 00:38:59,489
- is that we got lucky.
- Just give him a chance.

665
00:38:59,501 --> 00:39:00,801
But that was a lie, wasn't it?

666
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:03,203
Yes. Yes, okay?

667
00:39:03,271 --> 00:39:04,905
It was a lie.

668
00:39:12,447 --> 00:39:13,680
Look.

669
00:39:13,748 --> 00:39:18,551
That ship... brought me to Earth.

670
00:39:20,022 --> 00:39:21,354
Landed here in Smallville,

671
00:39:21,423 --> 00:39:23,190
right in those cornfields over there.

672
00:39:23,258 --> 00:39:27,460
I was sent here when my planet...

673
00:39:27,529 --> 00:39:30,831
Krypton, was destroyed.

674
00:39:30,899 --> 00:39:32,332
- Krypton?
- Yes.

675
00:39:32,401 --> 00:39:33,900
Because I wasn't from here,

676
00:39:33,969 --> 00:39:36,136
I had certain powers.

677
00:39:36,204 --> 00:39:38,038
Your grandparents, they took me in.

678
00:39:38,106 --> 00:39:39,706
They raised me.

679
00:39:39,775 --> 00:39:41,431
They taught me how
to control my abilities,

680
00:39:41,443 --> 00:39:42,743
how to blend in

681
00:39:42,811 --> 00:39:45,178
until the day I was ready to leave

682
00:39:45,247 --> 00:39:47,447
and become who I was sent here to be.

683
00:39:47,515 --> 00:39:49,682
You're saying you're Superman?

684
00:39:49,751 --> 00:39:51,184
No, I've seen Superman before.

685
00:39:51,253 --> 00:39:52,552
We've seen him.

686
00:40:59,154 --> 00:41:00,553
When your father first told me,

687
00:41:00,622 --> 00:41:03,055
I didn't understand either.

688
00:41:04,826 --> 00:41:06,793
I understand.

689
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,697
I understand all the excuses.

690
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,600
All the times you were
gone, you lied to us.

691
00:41:14,669 --> 00:41:15,869
You both did.

692
00:41:15,938 --> 00:41:17,370
He was saving lives, Jordan.

693
00:41:17,439 --> 00:41:20,006
That doesn't make it less true!

694
00:41:20,075 --> 00:41:22,109
You lied to protect his secret.

695
00:41:22,177 --> 00:41:24,410
All the things I've been feeling.

696
00:41:24,479 --> 00:41:27,247
You made me think I was
crazy. They put me on pills!

697
00:41:27,315 --> 00:41:29,105
Your mental health has
nothing to do with who your...

698
00:41:29,117 --> 00:41:30,851
And how do you know that?

699
00:41:30,919 --> 00:41:33,085
I'm half human, half
whatever the hell he is!

700
00:41:33,155 --> 00:41:34,410
Do not yell at your mother, okay?

701
00:41:34,422 --> 00:41:35,855
This is not her fault.

702
00:41:35,924 --> 00:41:38,024
I'm the one that didn't
want you to know.

703
00:41:38,093 --> 00:41:39,425
Why?

704
00:41:39,494 --> 00:41:40,984
Because I knew what
kind of burden it would be

705
00:41:40,996 --> 00:41:42,295
if you both had powers.

706
00:41:42,364 --> 00:41:43,553
Or worse, if one of you had them,

707
00:41:43,565 --> 00:41:44,764
and the other one didn't.

708
00:41:47,135 --> 00:41:50,136
You think he's the reason
we survived yesterday.

709
00:41:50,205 --> 00:41:51,972
- What are you talking about?
- Go on, Dad.

710
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,641
Go tell Superboy here
why he's really so perfect.

711
00:41:54,709 --> 00:41:57,177
We thought your athletic talents

712
00:41:57,245 --> 00:41:59,179
could be latent abilities
starting to emerge,

713
00:41:59,247 --> 00:42:00,680
and then yesterday...

714
00:42:00,749 --> 00:42:03,149
The only way that both
of you survived that accident

715
00:42:03,218 --> 00:42:05,251
is for at least one
of you to be like me.

716
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,654
You wouldn't have it any
other way, would you, Dad?

717
00:42:09,691 --> 00:42:10,890
Jordan!

718
00:42:10,959 --> 00:42:12,392
Don't try to talk to me, all right?

719
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,327
You may have been
sent here to be some hero,

720
00:42:14,396 --> 00:42:17,430
but you sure as hell weren't
sent here to be a father.

721
00:42:23,105 --> 00:42:24,938
Just leave us alone.

722
00:42:35,617 --> 00:42:39,118
Everything I do with the boys just...

723
00:42:39,187 --> 00:42:41,488
seems like it blows up in my face.

724
00:42:42,991 --> 00:42:44,457
Is Jordan right?

725
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,527
A... am I a bad father?

726
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:50,530
- Clark.
- 'Cause right now, I...

727
00:42:51,733 --> 00:42:55,468
It feels like it's my fault
that this is all falling apart.

728
00:42:58,006 --> 00:43:00,373
Your life falling apart
doesn't mean you're special.

729
00:43:00,442 --> 00:43:02,175
It means you're human.

730
00:43:05,614 --> 00:43:08,014
Another breach in progress.

731
00:43:11,686 --> 00:43:14,020
It's another nuclear facility.

732
00:43:14,089 --> 00:43:15,388
Hey.

733
00:43:17,025 --> 00:43:19,292
We're gonna be all right, okay?

734
00:43:20,728 --> 00:43:21,928
Go.

735
00:43:50,925 --> 00:43:52,892
I found your message.

736
00:43:54,663 --> 00:43:55,928
I know you're here.

737
00:43:55,997 --> 00:43:58,231
And I know you can't see me.

738
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,999
Lead encasements.

739
00:44:00,068 --> 00:44:01,934
You can't see through lead.

740
00:44:02,003 --> 00:44:03,970
One of your few weaknesses.

741
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:06,306
That's why you're
choosing nuclear facilities.

742
00:44:06,374 --> 00:44:07,930
You can watch me without me knowing.

743
00:44:07,942 --> 00:44:11,377
And see how good
you really are, Kal-El.

744
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,886
Hey, Sarah.

745
00:44:30,955 --> 00:44:32,521
Hey, you made it.

746
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:33,856
See you guys later.

747
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:38,260
I still don't understand
how you guys didn't get hurt.

748
00:44:38,329 --> 00:44:39,628
Still figuring that one out.

749
00:44:39,697 --> 00:44:42,998
Well, I'm just glad that you made it.

750
00:44:43,067 --> 00:44:44,333
You promised me trouble.

751
00:44:44,402 --> 00:44:46,501
Well, I will definitely do my best.

752
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:48,837
I don't really know how
you guys party in Metropolis,

753
00:44:48,906 --> 00:44:52,641
but here in Smallville,
we do it a little different.

754
00:45:00,117 --> 00:45:01,449
How do you know my name?

755
00:45:01,518 --> 00:45:02,878
I know everything there is to know

756
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,920
about the Last Son of Krypton.

757
00:45:04,989 --> 00:45:06,455
Where I come from,

758
00:45:06,523 --> 00:45:08,924
let's just say the two
of us have history.

759
00:45:08,993 --> 00:45:10,725
And where is that, exactly?

760
00:45:10,795 --> 00:45:12,127
Nowhere now.

761
00:45:12,196 --> 00:45:13,996
My world was destroyed.

762
00:45:14,064 --> 00:45:16,698
But somehow, I managed to survive.

763
00:45:16,767 --> 00:45:19,534
I eventually arrived
here, where I learned

764
00:45:19,603 --> 00:45:21,370
you were here too.

765
00:45:30,615 --> 00:45:32,314
Not as fast as I thought.

766
00:45:58,909 --> 00:46:00,809
Maybe you shouldn't.

767
00:46:00,878 --> 00:46:04,346
Beer and benzos don't really mix well.

768
00:46:04,414 --> 00:46:05,881
How'd you know?

769
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:10,385
I saw you take one back
at the funeral reception.

770
00:46:10,454 --> 00:46:13,088
But you're not the only one,

771
00:46:13,157 --> 00:46:16,658
you know, on something, so.

772
00:46:16,727 --> 00:46:18,661
You? For what?

773
00:46:18,729 --> 00:46:20,009
Are we really gonna do this now?

774
00:46:20,064 --> 00:46:21,664
Go full "Euphoria" on each other?

775
00:46:21,732 --> 00:46:24,433
We don't have to. I...

776
00:46:27,104 --> 00:46:28,937
You're just kinda

777
00:46:29,006 --> 00:46:31,006
the only person I know around here.

778
00:46:34,845 --> 00:46:36,344
No, it's cool.

779
00:46:39,249 --> 00:46:41,650
Up until I was...

780
00:46:43,487 --> 00:46:49,591
11 or 12, I had a pretty awesome life.

781
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:51,259
I mean, it wasn't perfect,

782
00:46:51,328 --> 00:46:54,529
but it was nice.

783
00:46:54,598 --> 00:46:58,633
Dolls and dance classes.

784
00:46:58,702 --> 00:47:02,037
But then something changed.

785
00:47:03,273 --> 00:47:07,509
People around here,
they get this sadness,

786
00:47:07,577 --> 00:47:09,377
and they act like it's
something you can catch

787
00:47:09,413 --> 00:47:11,647
like the flu, but...

788
00:47:11,716 --> 00:47:13,815
I never thought it was
gonna hit my house

789
00:47:13,884 --> 00:47:15,217
till it did.

790
00:47:15,285 --> 00:47:17,520
Now half the nights, my
dad sleeps on the couch,

791
00:47:17,588 --> 00:47:19,922
and my mom gets really mad
at him for being checked out,

792
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:22,357
but honestly, I can't blame him.

793
00:47:22,426 --> 00:47:25,961
He's a firefighter, and
being a firefighter here,

794
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:27,662
you see all the really bad stuff.

795
00:47:27,732 --> 00:47:29,812
I mean, stuff that no one
really wants to talk about.

796
00:47:29,834 --> 00:47:30,933
Like what?

797
00:47:31,001 --> 00:47:33,568
Like parents cooking meth

798
00:47:33,637 --> 00:47:35,571
and the whole house catching on fire

799
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,906
with the kids inside.

800
00:47:50,521 --> 00:47:52,121
Anyways...

801
00:47:53,524 --> 00:47:55,423
About a year ago,

802
00:47:55,492 --> 00:47:58,227
I took a bunch of my mom's pills.

803
00:47:59,864 --> 00:48:02,865
I still don't understand why I did it.

804
00:48:02,934 --> 00:48:06,001
I've never done
anything like that before,

805
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:10,805
and my mom, she made
a really big drama out of it.

806
00:48:10,874 --> 00:48:14,877
Lots of therapy and whatever.

807
00:48:14,946 --> 00:48:19,314
I know, for a... for a
sad story, it's really basic.

808
00:48:22,886 --> 00:48:25,988
No. It's not.

809
00:48:34,464 --> 00:48:35,864
- What are you doing?
- What?

810
00:48:35,933 --> 00:48:37,766
- Hey!
- Sean!

811
00:48:37,834 --> 00:48:39,134
That's my girlfriend!

812
00:48:39,203 --> 00:48:40,592
Sean, what the hell is your problem?

813
00:48:40,604 --> 00:48:41,971
The hell you doing with this guy?

814
00:48:42,039 --> 00:48:43,162
It doesn't even matter. Relax. Relax.

815
00:48:43,174 --> 00:48:44,373
Girlfriend?

816
00:48:44,441 --> 00:48:45,597
I would've gotten around to it,

817
00:48:45,609 --> 00:48:46,798
but you sorta kissed me first.

818
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:47,866
It's not that big of a deal!

819
00:48:47,878 --> 00:48:48,977
Back off!

820
00:48:52,516 --> 00:48:53,882
What the hell are you doing?

821
00:48:53,951 --> 00:48:55,307
You know how many
townies I had to randomly DM

822
00:48:55,319 --> 00:48:56,408
to find out where this party was?

823
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:57,920
Out of the way.

824
00:48:57,988 --> 00:48:59,454
Back off!

825
00:48:59,523 --> 00:49:01,723
You really don't want to
get in my face right now.

826
00:49:05,295 --> 00:49:06,595
Hey, hey, hey!

827
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:10,540
Get off of him!

828
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:12,097
What's wrong with you?!

829
00:50:23,941 --> 00:50:26,709
Aren't you curious how I
know so much about you, Kal-El?

830
00:50:38,856 --> 00:50:41,123
Like me, your home was destroyed.

831
00:50:41,191 --> 00:50:42,691
You were sent here as an infant

832
00:50:42,759 --> 00:50:44,479
to a world where you'd
spend your whole life

833
00:50:44,528 --> 00:50:47,028
trying to prove your worth,

834
00:50:47,097 --> 00:50:49,531
convince yourself you were one of them,

835
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:51,700
but you're not!

836
00:50:51,768 --> 00:50:53,869
You're still that scared, lost child,

837
00:50:53,938 --> 00:50:55,193
desperate for the love of people

838
00:50:55,205 --> 00:50:57,405
that will never accept you!

839
00:51:03,147 --> 00:51:05,614
And the only remnants
of your real home...

840
00:51:05,682 --> 00:51:06,949
Kryptonite...

841
00:51:07,017 --> 00:51:09,384
make you sick.

842
00:51:10,521 --> 00:51:12,420
Dust to dust.

843
00:51:12,489 --> 00:51:14,322
Superman.

844
00:51:32,647 --> 00:51:35,215
Yeah, have you still got
those contacts at HUD?

845
00:51:35,283 --> 00:51:37,484
I need you to check
Smallville Community Bank

846
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:39,109
for any unusual activity
in the last five or...

847
00:51:39,121 --> 00:51:41,521
reporter: Injuries are a concern.

848
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:43,123
Six years.

849
00:51:43,191 --> 00:51:45,692
This is a volatile
situation for firefighters.

850
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,694
Maxy, I gotta go.

851
00:51:52,601 --> 00:51:53,601
Clark.

852
00:51:58,173 --> 00:51:59,472
Who told you to wear a tie?

853
00:52:07,449 --> 00:52:09,916
Clark. Come home.

854
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:50,423
Dad.

855
00:52:50,492 --> 00:52:51,492
Jonathan!

856
00:52:53,562 --> 00:52:55,562
The other one's pretty shook up.

857
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:58,531
Twice in two days, Kent.

858
00:52:58,601 --> 00:53:01,067
Luckiest family I know.

859
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:02,468
Kyle.

860
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:05,072
Thank you.

861
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:10,477
- Are you okay? What happened?
- Dad. Dad.

862
00:53:10,545 --> 00:53:13,380
I... I don't know what
happened. Jordan...

863
00:53:27,729 --> 00:53:29,629
So you saved your brother.

864
00:53:30,598 --> 00:53:32,665
I wasn't sure what happened.

865
00:53:32,734 --> 00:53:34,567
That's why I didn't say anything.

866
00:53:36,071 --> 00:53:40,641
All I knew is, when I fell, I
felt something come over me.

867
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:46,046
It was a strength I've never had before.

868
00:53:46,114 --> 00:53:49,783
I felt... control.

869
00:53:53,555 --> 00:53:55,956
I... I don't know. It's hard to explain.

870
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:58,792
What's gonna happen to him?

871
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:00,160
I'm not sure yet.

872
00:54:00,229 --> 00:54:02,829
Jordan's power are manifesting

873
00:54:02,898 --> 00:54:05,265
very differently than mine did.

874
00:54:05,333 --> 00:54:07,701
But we're gonna help
you get through this, okay?

875
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:09,090
Yeah, it's probably like learning

876
00:54:09,104 --> 00:54:10,470
to drive a car, you know?

877
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:12,038
If cars were indestructible

878
00:54:12,107 --> 00:54:14,975
and had giant death
lasers as headlights.

879
00:54:20,615 --> 00:54:21,781
Yeah.

880
00:54:24,019 --> 00:54:25,151
Thanks.

881
00:54:28,957 --> 00:54:31,324
Apologize to your brother.

882
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,793
I know. Too soon. I know.

883
00:54:50,012 --> 00:54:52,044
You were right.

884
00:54:52,114 --> 00:54:53,980
I should've told them a long time ago.

885
00:54:54,049 --> 00:54:56,216
Jordan could've killed someone tonight.

886
00:54:56,285 --> 00:54:59,552
We just gotta be on the
same page going forward.

887
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,828
- IT WENT BY SO FAST
- These are the important years, Clark.

888
00:55:07,896 --> 00:55:10,697
Life's a little different in Smallville.

889
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:16,202
I think I know what my mom meant

890
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:18,305
when she said to come home.

891
00:55:18,373 --> 00:55:21,474
She knew how busy we are in Metropolis,

892
00:55:21,543 --> 00:55:23,210
how absent I've been.

893
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:25,746
I've tried convincing myself
that the boys would be fine

894
00:55:25,814 --> 00:55:28,515
and that it was okay for me
to be gone so much, but...

895
00:55:28,583 --> 00:55:30,083
I was wrong.

896
00:55:30,152 --> 00:55:31,592
You think your mom wanted us to move

897
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,119
to Smallville and live on the farm?

898
00:55:33,188 --> 00:55:35,055
It's a simpler life.

899
00:55:35,124 --> 00:55:37,891
More time with each other,
be part of a community,

900
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,459
and now this?

901
00:55:39,528 --> 00:55:43,196
I think she felt like this
family needs Smallville.

902
00:55:43,265 --> 00:55:45,731
As much as the world needs Superman?

903
00:55:51,273 --> 00:55:52,539
Look, I know.

904
00:55:52,607 --> 00:55:56,143
I know it would be a huge, huge change.

905
00:55:58,046 --> 00:55:59,746
Yeah, it would.

906
00:56:06,455 --> 00:56:08,554
But I think she was right.

907
00:56:10,625 --> 00:56:12,092
Really?

908
00:56:36,818 --> 00:56:38,918
You know, I think about my dad a lot.

909
00:56:40,555 --> 00:56:44,191
How he was just heading
off to church one day

910
00:56:44,259 --> 00:56:48,828
when a meteor crashed in his front yard.

911
00:56:48,896 --> 00:56:50,596
And just like that...

912
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,100
He was a father.

913
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:01,641
I didn't know it back then, but...

914
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:04,176
but he had no idea what he was doing.

915
00:57:11,453 --> 00:57:13,553
Ah, it didn't matter.

916
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:17,257
'Cause he was always there.

917
00:57:22,831 --> 00:57:24,064
You were right.

918
00:57:26,301 --> 00:57:28,368
I haven't always been there for you.

919
00:57:28,436 --> 00:57:32,244
But I promise you, from now on,

920
00:57:32,256 --> 00:57:34,474
I will be.

921
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:55,641
I pulled some strings,
got you $2,100 an acre,

922
00:57:55,653 --> 00:57:58,087
which is well above
market value in Rice County.

923
00:57:58,155 --> 00:58:01,256
Wow, that... that's very generous.

924
00:58:03,227 --> 00:58:05,995
But we decided
we're... we're not selling.

925
00:58:06,063 --> 00:58:07,697
You're not?

926
00:58:07,765 --> 00:58:10,299
We're thinking of reopening the farm.

927
00:58:10,368 --> 00:58:13,636
Run it the way my folks
and I used to back in the day.

928
00:58:13,705 --> 00:58:15,304
So you're staying.

929
00:58:15,373 --> 00:58:16,939
Well, we're talking it over,

930
00:58:17,008 --> 00:58:19,475
but a change might
be good for this family.

931
00:58:22,179 --> 00:58:23,412
Okay.

932
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:27,249
Then let's go over the
pre-negotiated terms

933
00:58:27,318 --> 00:58:28,751
for taking over the loan.

934
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:31,186
Before we do, Lana, I was wondering

935
00:58:31,255 --> 00:58:32,855
if you knew that

936
00:58:32,924 --> 00:58:35,181
a couple months before those
reverse mortgages were offered,

937
00:58:35,193 --> 00:58:38,094
a company had secretly
acquired your bank.

938
00:58:38,162 --> 00:58:39,629
No, I didn't know that.

939
00:58:39,697 --> 00:58:41,030
Galaxy Holdings,

940
00:58:41,099 --> 00:58:43,633
whose majority
shareholder is Morgan Edge.

941
00:58:45,369 --> 00:58:47,069
Why would someone like Morgan Edge

942
00:58:47,138 --> 00:58:49,371
be interested in a bunch of family farms

943
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,374
in Smallville, Kansas?

944
00:58:52,443 --> 00:58:54,610
That's a very good question.

945
00:59:00,384 --> 00:59:02,784
How's everyone doing after last night?

946
00:59:02,854 --> 00:59:05,187
Tag Harris broke his arm.

947
00:59:05,256 --> 00:59:09,091
Other than that, nobody else got hurt.

948
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:11,227
Anyone say what caused the explosion?

949
00:59:11,295 --> 00:59:15,164
My dad said it was probably
just a methane pocket.

950
00:59:22,273 --> 00:59:24,674
Look, I should've never
kissed you last night.

951
00:59:24,742 --> 00:59:28,077
Wow. That is awkward.

952
00:59:28,145 --> 00:59:29,344
Good luck.

953
00:59:30,548 --> 00:59:31,747
It's not your fault.

954
00:59:31,816 --> 00:59:33,148
You didn't know about Sean,

955
00:59:33,217 --> 00:59:35,684
and I'm just really sorry

956
00:59:35,753 --> 00:59:37,352
about how it all went down.

957
00:59:38,923 --> 00:59:40,723
I just wanted to hang out with you.

958
00:59:40,792 --> 00:59:43,893
You were so sweet that summer
that we met, and then yeah,

959
00:59:43,961 --> 00:59:45,928
I saw you take that
pill at the funeral...

960
00:59:47,498 --> 00:59:51,400
I just thought that if
someone like you had issues,

961
00:59:51,469 --> 00:59:54,971
then someone like me
wasn't so messed up.

962
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:56,405
I think maybe it means we're both

963
00:59:56,473 --> 00:59:59,075
just a little messed up.

964
01:00:00,712 --> 01:00:02,211
Yeah, maybe you're right.

965
01:00:05,549 --> 01:00:08,117
Do you think that you
can keep it a secret?

966
01:00:08,186 --> 01:00:11,087
Uh, one person finds out,
and then everybody knows,

967
01:00:11,155 --> 01:00:13,222
- and it's just...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

968
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:16,092
Your secret's safe with me.

969
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,226
Thanks.

970
01:00:17,295 --> 01:00:18,961
Sarah!

971
01:00:21,332 --> 01:00:23,933
- I'm sorry...
- It's... it's all right.

972
01:00:27,338 --> 01:00:29,305
- See you around.
- Yeah.

973
01:00:40,584 --> 01:00:44,120
Well, that didn't look
like a total disaster.

974
01:00:44,188 --> 01:00:46,355
- All right?
- Yeah, yeah, look.

975
01:00:46,423 --> 01:00:50,525
Um, Jon, about the powers, uh...

976
01:00:50,594 --> 01:00:52,795
It's all good.

977
01:00:52,864 --> 01:00:54,163
- Huh?
- Yeah.

978
01:00:54,231 --> 01:00:56,232
Powers are overrated anyways.

979
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:59,768
Plus this just confirms

980
01:00:59,837 --> 01:01:01,336
what I've known to be true all along.

981
01:01:01,405 --> 01:01:02,637
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

982
01:01:02,706 --> 01:01:04,606
My skills on the field are legit.

983
01:01:06,077 --> 01:01:07,309
Come on.

984
01:01:25,029 --> 01:01:27,529
Still cannot believe
that you said that to her.

985
01:01:31,435 --> 01:01:33,369
Hey, boys.

986
01:01:33,437 --> 01:01:35,204
What would you guys
think about staying here

987
01:01:35,273 --> 01:01:37,840
a little longer than any of us planned?

988
01:01:37,909 --> 01:01:40,009
Like a couple days or something?

989
01:01:41,812 --> 01:01:44,613
More like permanently.

990
01:01:44,681 --> 01:01:46,748
Uh, I mean, I... I have school.

991
01:01:46,818 --> 01:01:48,651
Practice, the team.

992
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,685
We know, we know.
It's a big conversation.

993
01:01:50,754 --> 01:01:52,411
Yeah, we'll have it
tonight at family dinner.

994
01:01:52,423 --> 01:01:53,945
We just wanted to
give you both some time

995
01:01:53,957 --> 01:01:56,992
to process what this
would really be like

996
01:01:57,061 --> 01:01:59,295
before we do.

997
01:01:59,363 --> 01:02:00,896
Okay.

998
01:02:00,965 --> 01:02:02,754
Well, until then, you two,
follow me out to the barn.

999
01:02:02,766 --> 01:02:04,633
I wanna show you a few things.

1000
01:02:04,702 --> 01:02:06,101
Like Superman things?

1001
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:08,470
Like how to attach
a plow to a tractor.

1002
01:02:08,539 --> 01:02:09,972
- What?
- Seriously?

1003
01:02:10,041 --> 01:02:11,397
Those fields aren't
gonna plow themselves.

1004
01:02:11,409 --> 01:02:13,142
Okay, but Dad, we have questions.

1005
01:02:13,211 --> 01:02:14,533
We just found out our dad's Superman.

1006
01:02:14,545 --> 01:02:15,778
Yeah, like, thousands

1007
01:02:15,847 --> 01:02:17,646
and thousands of questions...

1008
01:02:48,179 --> 01:02:50,246
We need to improve
tactile function and speed

1009
01:02:50,314 --> 01:02:51,447
if I'm gonna end this.

1010
01:02:51,515 --> 01:02:52,982
We also need Kryptonite.

1011
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:55,051
That was the last of your supply.

1012
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:58,087
Then we'll have to go get some.

1013
01:02:58,156 --> 01:03:01,390
I'll install the upgrades
to your armor right away.

1014
01:03:01,458 --> 01:03:02,691
Captain Luthor.

1015
