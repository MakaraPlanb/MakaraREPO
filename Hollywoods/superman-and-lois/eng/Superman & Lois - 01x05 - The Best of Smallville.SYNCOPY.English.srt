1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,730
Previously on "Superman & Lois"...

2
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:04,206
Let's just focus on what
we came here for: family.

3
00:00:04,211 --> 00:00:05,507
- Miss?
- Sharon Powell.

4
00:00:05,512 --> 00:00:07,788
My son was a miner at the Edge Facility.

5
00:00:07,793 --> 00:00:09,089
Morgan Edge offered him

6
00:00:09,094 --> 00:00:10,824
"the opportunity of a lifetime".

7
00:00:10,829 --> 00:00:12,355
Turns out, Miss Powell's son

8
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,060
isn't the only worker
who's gone missing.

9
00:00:14,065 --> 00:00:15,162
How's Eliza doing?

10
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:16,429
She's okay, she's okay.

11
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:17,663
Maybe... maybe too okay.

12
00:00:17,668 --> 00:00:18,668
Tag, Tag?

13
00:00:18,673 --> 00:00:21,601
I think my heat vision,
it affected him somehow.

14
00:00:21,606 --> 00:00:24,570
Don't try to tell me it wasn't my fault.

15
00:00:24,575 --> 00:00:25,772
Captain Luthor?

16
00:00:25,777 --> 00:00:26,802
We need to stop Kal-El

17
00:00:26,807 --> 00:00:28,269
before he does to this world

18
00:00:28,274 --> 00:00:30,408
what he did to mine.

19
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,454
I've always loved Smallville
during the fall.

20
00:00:47,932 --> 00:00:49,696
The changing of seasons...

21
00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:55,668
The turning of time.

22
00:01:01,612 --> 00:01:03,609
The last warm moments

23
00:01:03,614 --> 00:01:05,645
before the cold.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
_

25
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,201
But what I loved most of all...

26
00:01:30,206 --> 00:01:33,137
was the one weekend every year

27
00:01:33,142 --> 00:01:35,173
when everyone came together

28
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,509
and sacrificed to help those in need.

29
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,381
Harvest Fest?

30
00:01:40,484 --> 00:01:44,349
So, is that why you've been
"Supermanning" all week?

31
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,984
So you free up some time to go to this?

32
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:48,987
It's a tradition! Goes
all the way back to 1949

33
00:01:48,992 --> 00:01:50,455
when Smallville was established.

34
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,991
It's one of the best things
about being here.

35
00:01:51,995 --> 00:01:53,692
I have been hearing
about this from your dad

36
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,158
since we first started dating.

37
00:01:55,163 --> 00:01:56,960
Bedtime stories to help you
sleep, or what?

38
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:00,499
Either way, it doesn't sound
like much of a festival.

39
00:02:00,503 --> 00:02:02,601
Just sounds like a whole bunch
of people selling stuff.

40
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:04,201
Not just sell. Share!

41
00:02:04,206 --> 00:02:06,104
You know, whatever they can,
with anyone who needs it.

42
00:02:06,108 --> 00:02:08,839
Think of it as Smallville's
version of Burning Man.

43
00:02:08,844 --> 00:02:10,270
Minus the fires and BO,

44
00:02:10,275 --> 00:02:11,575
- I hope.
- Ha, ha.

45
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,210
Your grandmother loved it, okay?

46
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:14,345
She used to spend weeks planning

47
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:15,613
what we were gonna donate.

48
00:02:15,618 --> 00:02:17,581
She made lists and spreadsheets.

49
00:02:17,586 --> 00:02:19,117
Your dad learned a lot about giving

50
00:02:19,121 --> 00:02:20,984
and helping people in need from this.

51
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:23,754
Your dad's not Superman just
'cause he has powers, you know.

52
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,154
Aw, thanks, baby.

53
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,523
I know you guys aren't sold,

54
00:02:26,528 --> 00:02:28,026
but when you see everyone
come together like this,

55
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,660
the... the sense of community,

56
00:02:29,664 --> 00:02:31,564
it's... it's the best
of what Smallville is.

57
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:33,130
It just doesn't sound
like much of a festival.

58
00:02:33,134 --> 00:02:34,364
Well, they have all that stuff too.

59
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,465
The food stands alone.

60
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,467
Funnel cakes, fried cheese curds...

61
00:02:37,472 --> 00:02:39,068
Ooh! The Fishers!

62
00:02:39,073 --> 00:02:40,905
Every year, they have this
"Sugar Bowl" stand.

63
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:42,639
They make chocolate bacon.

64
00:02:42,644 --> 00:02:45,274
- So good!
- Uh, Eliza's vegetarian, so.

65
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:46,676
- Oh.
- Hey, I'm glad

66
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:48,210
she's finally able to come visit.

67
00:02:48,215 --> 00:02:50,580
Look, the Harvest Fest is special, okay?

68
00:02:50,585 --> 00:02:53,182
Eliza's gonna love it,
you're gonna love it...

69
00:02:53,187 --> 00:02:54,784
all of you are gonna love it.

70
00:02:56,724 --> 00:02:58,854
- Let's go! Corn, let's go!
- We're gonna love it.

71
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:01,225
What?

72
00:03:01,768 --> 00:03:03,130
Two essays in one night.

73
00:03:03,135 --> 00:03:04,501
It's ridiculous. It's,
like, he can't even

74
00:03:04,505 --> 00:03:06,227
- write himself.
- Hey, Sarah.

75
00:03:06,232 --> 00:03:07,496
- Hey.
- Hey.

76
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:10,229
Wow, um, they really go all-out

77
00:03:10,234 --> 00:03:12,334
with this Harvest Fest stuff, huh?

78
00:03:12,339 --> 00:03:14,703
I know it's kinda hokey, but...

79
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,339
it has its own kind of specialness.

80
00:03:17,344 --> 00:03:18,574
You sound like my dad.

81
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:21,076
Shut up.

82
00:03:21,081 --> 00:03:22,544
Um, you guys going tonight?

83
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:24,880
Yeah. Actually, Eliza's coming too.

84
00:03:24,885 --> 00:03:27,483
- Ooh, Metropolis girl?
- Yeah.

85
00:03:27,488 --> 00:03:28,884
What about you?

86
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:32,620
Do you maybe wanna go together?

87
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,990
L... like from beginning to end?

88
00:03:35,995 --> 00:03:39,060
That is how I understand
the concept of "together".

89
00:03:39,065 --> 00:03:40,227
Um, Sarah,

90
00:03:40,232 --> 00:03:41,830
let me just speak for my brother here.

91
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:43,130
He would love to go with you.

92
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:46,066
Right?

93
00:03:46,071 --> 00:03:48,870
Yeah, no, no, no, yeah.
I would love to go.

94
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,304
Great. Um...

95
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:51,973
we'll meet up beforehand?

96
00:03:51,978 --> 00:03:53,109
For sure, yeah. I'll text you

97
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:54,509
when Eliza's coming.

98
00:03:54,514 --> 00:03:56,043
Cool, okay. Um...

99
00:03:56,048 --> 00:03:57,513
Awesome, well.

100
00:03:57,517 --> 00:03:58,579
Oh.

101
00:03:58,584 --> 00:03:59,850
Okay.

102
00:04:01,453 --> 00:04:03,183
Hey, babe, what's up?

103
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:07,555
What? What are you...

104
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,092
what are you talking about?

105
00:04:10,429 --> 00:04:12,092
Eliza! Hey, hey.

106
00:04:12,097 --> 00:04:15,097
Eliza, can we... can we please
just talk about this?

107
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:17,964
Okay. Whatever.

108
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:19,399
Yeah, bye.

109
00:04:21,472 --> 00:04:22,569
That didn't sound good.

110
00:04:22,574 --> 00:04:24,608
It's great. Great...

111
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:27,888
If you consider getting dumped

112
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,643
by your girlfriend of over a year

113
00:04:29,648 --> 00:04:32,245
the night you're supposed
to see her "great".

114
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,446
Look, man, that sucks.

115
00:04:34,853 --> 00:04:36,683
All good. Welcome to Smallville,

116
00:04:36,688 --> 00:04:40,020
the place where you get
dumped over the phone, right?

117
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:51,397
Hey.

118
00:04:51,402 --> 00:04:52,965
What are you up to?

119
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,101
I was thinking we'd
make this the home office

120
00:04:56,106 --> 00:04:58,040
of the world's most famous journalist.

121
00:04:58,842 --> 00:05:00,473
But these are all your mom's things.

122
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:01,941
Yeah, I know, but

123
00:05:01,946 --> 00:05:03,476
it's what she would've wanted.

124
00:05:03,481 --> 00:05:05,005
And the Harvest Fest is the perfect time

125
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:06,579
to give this stuff away.

126
00:05:06,584 --> 00:05:07,680
Okay.

127
00:05:07,685 --> 00:05:09,585
If this is really what you want.

128
00:05:10,388 --> 00:05:11,417
No, no, no!

129
00:05:11,422 --> 00:05:12,685
Not that. Sorry.

130
00:05:15,926 --> 00:05:17,490
Hey, Chrissy.

131
00:05:17,495 --> 00:05:19,825
Lois, are you coming in soon?

132
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,960
Why, what's going on?

133
00:05:20,965 --> 00:05:22,928
Uh, Sharon Powell's here.

134
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:23,996
She okay?

135
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:26,865
Yeah, she's okay, actually.

136
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,304
And so is her son.

137
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,337
You don't remember what happened?

138
00:05:32,342 --> 00:05:34,005
Uh, no, ma'am.

139
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,373
I was coming through the tunnel

140
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:37,075
and I was reading my paycheck.

141
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,411
Hadn't seen a number
that big in a long time.

142
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:42,380
Just wasn't paying attention,
I guess, and...

143
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:43,848
hit it real good.

144
00:05:43,853 --> 00:05:46,351
Next thing I know, I wake up
in Stanton County.

145
00:05:46,356 --> 00:05:47,986
They found him outside a church.

146
00:05:47,991 --> 00:05:49,053
St. Anthony's.

147
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:50,255
They helped me remember

148
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,023
who I was.

149
00:05:52,028 --> 00:05:53,492
I saw the flyer that you made.

150
00:05:53,497 --> 00:05:55,660
That was the best call of my life.

151
00:05:55,665 --> 00:05:58,630
What about the phone messages
you left your mom?

152
00:05:59,936 --> 00:06:01,432
I don't know anything about that.

153
00:06:01,437 --> 00:06:03,567
You said the job wasn't
what you expected.

154
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:04,972
You sounded scared.

155
00:06:04,977 --> 00:06:06,403
Well, the doctors said

156
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,145
that with a hit to the head like that,

157
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,782
it might take some time
for his memories...

158
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,276
return.

159
00:06:17,286 --> 00:06:20,184
Look, Miss Lane, we are so grateful

160
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:23,187
for your help, but I'm just...

161
00:06:23,192 --> 00:06:25,056
so happy that he's back.

162
00:06:25,061 --> 00:06:28,059
All this other stuff, it just
doesn't matter anymore.

163
00:06:28,064 --> 00:06:30,794
Sharon, someone tried to kill you.

164
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:32,495
I have my son back.

165
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,065
T... there's just no more
story to tell anymore.

166
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,567
W... we just came to say thank you.

167
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,039
- It's up to you.
- What?

168
00:06:42,044 --> 00:06:43,775
You were almost murdered

169
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,206
by someone with superhuman strength,

170
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,810
and you're just gonna let that go?

171
00:06:46,815 --> 00:06:48,278
You wanna write something?

172
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,747
Write about how my
missing son has returned.

173
00:06:50,752 --> 00:06:52,318
That's a nice story.

174
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:54,854
Thank you for your time.

175
00:07:01,563 --> 00:07:03,159
Okay, that phony story

176
00:07:03,164 --> 00:07:05,260
- was all sorts of rehearsed.
- I know.

177
00:07:05,265 --> 00:07:06,830
Sharon almost got killed
by someone who works

178
00:07:06,834 --> 00:07:08,463
- for Morgan Edge.
- Yep.

179
00:07:08,468 --> 00:07:10,232
I'm acting like you right now?

180
00:07:10,237 --> 00:07:12,935
That's because we both know
this is a big story.

181
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,637
And we will figure it out, but for now,

182
00:07:14,641 --> 00:07:17,106
let's just be happy
she got her son back.

183
00:07:21,481 --> 00:07:24,013
It appears we've successfully located

184
00:07:24,018 --> 00:07:25,915
Lois Lane, Captain Luthor.

185
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,118
Are you certain this is
the best course of action?

186
00:07:29,123 --> 00:07:30,452
I am.

187
00:07:30,457 --> 00:07:32,654
One thing I know for
sure about this world...

188
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:34,523
wherever Lois Lane goes,

189
00:07:34,528 --> 00:07:36,625
Superman follows.

190
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:40,061
_

191
00:07:43,236 --> 00:07:45,567
Great, housewares.

192
00:07:45,572 --> 00:07:47,268
All we could give this year, Lana.

193
00:07:47,273 --> 00:07:49,971
Oh, don't you apologize, Aidy.

194
00:07:49,976 --> 00:07:52,406
Not after everything
you've been through.

195
00:07:52,411 --> 00:07:54,045
Thank you.

196
00:07:59,786 --> 00:08:01,049
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

197
00:08:01,054 --> 00:08:02,483
Couple bags of men's clothes.

198
00:08:02,488 --> 00:08:04,618
Oh, great. We always get so much

199
00:08:04,623 --> 00:08:06,855
women's clothes but not enough men's.

200
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,790
Can I get a name for recognition?

201
00:08:08,795 --> 00:08:11,229
Sure, it's Sharon and Derek Powell.

202
00:08:13,365 --> 00:08:15,295
Derek Powell?

203
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,264
From New Carthage?

204
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:19,166
Glad you're back.

205
00:08:19,171 --> 00:08:20,934
Yep, got a happy ending.

206
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:23,436
I-I'll go get the rest of the bags.

207
00:08:26,845 --> 00:08:30,346
Ah.

208
00:08:36,188 --> 00:08:39,219
Ms. Larr, there's something wrong.

209
00:08:40,725 --> 00:08:43,390
I... I don't know. I... I feel off.

210
00:08:43,395 --> 00:08:44,792
Ah.

211
00:08:46,665 --> 00:08:48,427
I need to see you.

212
00:08:48,432 --> 00:08:49,762
Now.

213
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,864
Hello?

214
00:08:51,869 --> 00:08:54,600
Are you there?

215
00:08:54,605 --> 00:08:58,810
Ah!

216
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,767
Well, it's a different look for you.

217
00:09:21,772 --> 00:09:23,970
I feel like it really pops.

218
00:09:23,975 --> 00:09:25,705
Ah.

219
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,641
Yeah, it's definitely assertive.

220
00:09:28,646 --> 00:09:32,111
You sure you want to wear that
to the Harvest Fest, honey?

221
00:09:32,116 --> 00:09:34,480
You know, Lana's gonna be there.

222
00:09:34,485 --> 00:09:35,848
You're right.

223
00:09:35,853 --> 00:09:37,917
I should probably stick with flannel.

224
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:42,424
I know you don't like
talking about it, but...

225
00:09:43,524 --> 00:09:45,921
is Lana still seeing that Cushing boy?

226
00:09:45,926 --> 00:09:47,226
Mm.

227
00:09:47,231 --> 00:09:48,760
See? No alarms.

228
00:09:48,765 --> 00:09:50,396
Let's get out of here as fast as we can.

229
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,667
Easy, now!

230
00:09:55,672 --> 00:09:57,336
This is some real high-end equipment.

231
00:09:57,341 --> 00:09:59,107
Which you need to put back.

232
00:10:00,043 --> 00:10:01,806
I think you got the wrong idea, here,

233
00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:03,275
Ski Mask Guy.

234
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,009
Pretty sure you used that crowbar

235
00:10:05,014 --> 00:10:06,111
to break into this shop,

236
00:10:06,116 --> 00:10:07,613
where you stole 12 TVs,

237
00:10:07,618 --> 00:10:10,081
10 VCRs, and more than
a few salad shooters.

238
00:10:11,321 --> 00:10:12,987
Put the stuff back.

239
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,220
Sorry, kid.

240
00:10:28,304 --> 00:10:29,667
Put it back.

241
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,304
Our bad.

242
00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:34,639
We'll put it all back.

243
00:10:34,644 --> 00:10:36,240
Like we were never here.

244
00:10:48,457 --> 00:10:50,221
I need more hoses on the roof now!

245
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:56,359
Tamara's gonna get you looked at, okay?

246
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,864
- Where's Mitch?
- Thought he was with you.

247
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:01,498
Mitch!

248
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,003
Mitch!

249
00:11:04,673 --> 00:11:05,902
Mitch, you in here?

250
00:11:07,108 --> 00:11:09,339
Mitch!

251
00:11:10,645 --> 00:11:12,075
Mitch!

252
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,110
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.
This is Chief Cushing.

253
00:11:14,115 --> 00:11:16,346
I got eyes on Mitch.
Bravo, Charlie, corner.

254
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,714
Heavy smoke and fire.

255
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,282
You're gonna be all right, okay?

256
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:21,118
Right, now, get your arm
around my shoulder.

257
00:11:21,122 --> 00:11:22,752
- Ah!
- There we go.

258
00:11:22,757 --> 00:11:24,224
Ah.

259
00:11:31,032 --> 00:11:33,632
You're gonna be all right. There you go.

260
00:11:34,969 --> 00:11:36,565
Okay. Just come on.

261
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,650
Let's pick up that pace
just a little bit, okay, bud?

262
00:11:40,975 --> 00:11:42,304
Ah!

263
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,744
Ah, ah.

264
00:11:54,488 --> 00:11:56,155
Close one, boss.

265
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,187
Come on.

266
00:11:58,192 --> 00:11:59,321
We got 'em, Chief.

267
00:11:59,326 --> 00:12:00,856
- Come on, Mitch.
- Come on.

268
00:12:00,861 --> 00:12:02,090
- Come on.
- Here we go.

269
00:12:02,095 --> 00:12:03,859
- Come on.
- Come on, let's just go.

270
00:12:03,864 --> 00:12:05,894
Come on!

271
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,874
Is that...

272
00:12:16,643 --> 00:12:18,673
is that frost?

273
00:12:25,585 --> 00:12:27,249
I should've been there sooner.

274
00:12:27,254 --> 00:12:28,917
By the time I got there,
all the donations

275
00:12:28,921 --> 00:12:30,085
were already destroyed.

276
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,920
That's awful. What are they gonna do?

277
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:32,925
I don't know.

278
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,055
Most people already gave

279
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,760
everything they have to offer.

280
00:12:37,297 --> 00:12:40,094
Sharon Powell was hanging
around outside the Center.

281
00:12:40,099 --> 00:12:41,128
At the fire?

282
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:42,696
- Yeah.
- Was Derek there?

283
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:44,731
No. It seemed like she was
looking for someone, though.

284
00:12:44,735 --> 00:12:46,667
- It could've been him.
- That doesn't sound right.

285
00:12:46,671 --> 00:12:48,769
I'm gonna go down
and start asking questions.

286
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,439
Guys, got your favorite pizza.

287
00:12:52,444 --> 00:12:53,974
I'm not hungry.

288
00:12:53,979 --> 00:12:56,177
Eliza dumped him this morning.

289
00:12:57,549 --> 00:12:59,814
I'll go talk to him.

290
00:13:02,021 --> 00:13:04,185
First breakups are rough.

291
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:07,254
Pretty much crawled into
an REO Speedwagon rabbit hole.

292
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:08,689
Speedwagon?

293
00:13:08,694 --> 00:13:10,891
- Never mind.
- All right.

294
00:13:13,165 --> 00:13:14,361
Jonathan?

295
00:13:18,203 --> 00:13:20,189
Jordan just had to go

296
00:13:20,194 --> 00:13:21,525
and announce it to the world, huh?

297
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:23,396
He's just worried about you.

298
00:13:24,075 --> 00:13:25,772
So am I. Do you wanna talk about it?

299
00:13:25,777 --> 00:13:28,007
What is there to talk about?
I mean, clearly,

300
00:13:28,012 --> 00:13:30,710
she knows that she can do
better than dating some kid

301
00:13:30,715 --> 00:13:32,445
from some middle-of-nowhere town.

302
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,681
I'm sure it's complicated
for her, too, sweetie.

303
00:13:34,686 --> 00:13:36,450
Our move here was really sudden.

304
00:13:36,455 --> 00:13:38,352
Are you seriously
taking her side right now?

305
00:13:38,357 --> 00:13:40,386
No. I'm just saying,

306
00:13:40,391 --> 00:13:42,022
as a former teenage girl myself,

307
00:13:42,027 --> 00:13:43,457
you gotta give it some time.

308
00:13:43,462 --> 00:13:45,425
She might wake up and remember

309
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,126
how incredible you are.

310
00:13:47,131 --> 00:13:48,795
And if she doesn't, then it's her loss.

311
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,829
Well, thanks for
your Cosmo Girl opinion,

312
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:53,833
but, honestly, I just want
to be left alone right now.

313
00:14:03,681 --> 00:14:05,311
Trigger warning, Lane.

314
00:14:05,316 --> 00:14:06,946
Don't want you having any flashbacks

315
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,284
to what happened to your car.

316
00:14:09,553 --> 00:14:11,751
Any idea what caused this?

317
00:14:11,756 --> 00:14:12,889
Not sure.

318
00:14:13,691 --> 00:14:15,989
You know, I don't know
what's more confusing,

319
00:14:15,994 --> 00:14:18,057
how the damn thing started
or how it ended.

320
00:14:18,062 --> 00:14:19,395
Was anybody hurt?

321
00:14:20,865 --> 00:14:22,828
Tom Mitchell.

322
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,100
I met him at your barbecue. Nice guy.

323
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:28,600
He was the best man at my wedding.

324
00:14:28,605 --> 00:14:30,935
You know, probably the bravest person

325
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,004
we got on this crew.

326
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:34,072
Is gonna be okay?

327
00:14:34,077 --> 00:14:35,774
You know, it's not looking good.

328
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:38,277
So unless you got any more questions...

329
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:39,811
I do have one, sorry.

330
00:14:39,816 --> 00:14:42,947
Have you seen this guy
anywhere near the Center?

331
00:14:42,952 --> 00:14:44,316
Derek Powell?

332
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:46,018
I might've seen him

333
00:14:46,023 --> 00:14:47,119
come around the back.

334
00:14:47,124 --> 00:14:48,520
W... why are you asking?

335
00:14:48,525 --> 00:14:51,223
I need to talk to him about a story.

336
00:14:51,228 --> 00:14:53,892
Thanks for your time.
I'm sorry about your friend.

337
00:14:57,301 --> 00:14:59,930
Chrissy, Kyle saw Derek Powell
at the Center

338
00:14:59,935 --> 00:15:01,265
as the fire trucks arrived.

339
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,334
Well, that's 50 shades of suspicious.

340
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:04,802
We don't know anything for sure yet.

341
00:15:04,807 --> 00:15:07,638
My big reporter energy knows something

342
00:15:07,643 --> 00:15:10,007
crazy weird's going on
with Derek Powell.

343
00:15:10,012 --> 00:15:11,498
I need you to get his mom

344
00:15:11,503 --> 00:15:12,967
and get her to The Gazette right now.

345
00:15:12,971 --> 00:15:14,745
- On it.
- Miss Lane?

346
00:15:16,485 --> 00:15:18,182
I've been looking for you.

347
00:15:21,357 --> 00:15:22,520
So you're a reporter?

348
00:15:22,525 --> 00:15:23,525
That's right.

349
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,530
Marcus Bridgewater.

350
00:15:24,535 --> 00:15:25,977
Sounds vaguely familiar.

351
00:15:25,982 --> 00:15:27,512
- "Politico"?
- "Reuters".

352
00:15:27,517 --> 00:15:29,114
Mainly do business coverage,

353
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:30,782
focusing on big tech.

354
00:15:30,787 --> 00:15:32,817
I have a background in engineering.

355
00:15:32,822 --> 00:15:35,220
I used to work at LutherCorps.

356
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:38,389
Lex Luthor, the only human
being worse than Morgan Edge.

357
00:15:38,394 --> 00:15:39,925
Guy, uh...

358
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,426
Definitely has his secrets.

359
00:15:41,431 --> 00:15:43,786
So what exactly brings
a "Reuters" tech reporter

360
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,931
to Smallville, Kansas?

361
00:15:45,936 --> 00:15:47,566
You.

362
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:50,068
I'm a huge fan. And
after reading your piece

363
00:15:50,072 --> 00:15:51,836
- on Morgan Edge...
- My heavily redacted piece.

364
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,438
I thought there might be
a bigger story here,

365
00:15:53,442 --> 00:15:55,373
so I did a little digging.

366
00:15:55,378 --> 00:15:57,608
- You trying to poach my story?
- That's not my intent.

367
00:15:57,613 --> 00:15:59,577
Just wanna be on team Lois.

368
00:15:59,582 --> 00:16:02,516
Not sure I have much
of a roster these days.

369
00:16:03,486 --> 00:16:05,283
Still have Superman.

370
00:16:05,288 --> 00:16:07,514
Unless someone else is covering him

371
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,019
now that you've left Metropolis?

372
00:16:09,024 --> 00:16:10,988
He's a public figure.
Anyone can cover him.

373
00:16:10,993 --> 00:16:12,423
Yeah, but, you're the one

374
00:16:12,428 --> 00:16:14,725
who seems to always have
the inside track.

375
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:16,527
He's just someone I report on.

376
00:16:16,532 --> 00:16:18,562
Sure, but, without you,
I think we all know

377
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:21,402
there'd be a lot more
questions about the guy.

378
00:16:23,306 --> 00:16:25,169
So, what is it you have on Morgan Edge?

379
00:16:25,174 --> 00:16:26,970
Nothing yet. But I think I may

380
00:16:26,975 --> 00:16:29,973
have found a way to get
a look inside the mines.

381
00:16:29,978 --> 00:16:31,108
Thanks.

382
00:16:31,113 --> 00:16:32,842
Doesn't exactly sound legal.

383
00:16:32,847 --> 00:16:35,378
The less you know, the better.

384
00:16:35,383 --> 00:16:37,114
Well, if you manage to dig something up,

385
00:16:37,118 --> 00:16:38,548
give me a call.

386
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,220
Maybe we'll split the byline?

387
00:16:44,225 --> 00:16:46,690
Let's see what you come up with first.

388
00:16:50,432 --> 00:16:53,230
He really said that to you?

389
00:16:54,703 --> 00:16:56,700
Didn't even have the nerve.

390
00:16:56,705 --> 00:16:58,738
He sent me a text, I mean...

391
00:16:59,641 --> 00:17:02,004
I just got him back,
and... and out of nowhere,

392
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:04,040
he needs "space"?

393
00:17:04,045 --> 00:17:06,778
He say anything about where he's going?

394
00:17:08,915 --> 00:17:11,115
Any chance I can see that text?

395
00:17:12,786 --> 00:17:14,286
Sure.

396
00:17:16,223 --> 00:17:17,654
You and Derek wouldn't be sharing

397
00:17:17,658 --> 00:17:19,254
a phone plan, by any chance?

398
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:20,757
- It's the only way anyone can afford it
- _

399
00:17:20,761 --> 00:17:22,291
these days.

400
00:17:22,296 --> 00:17:23,862
- Why do you ask?
- _

401
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:26,162
Um...

402
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:28,330
I just wanted to vent.

403
00:17:28,335 --> 00:17:30,932
God, those phone companies
are such crooks, right?

404
00:17:39,246 --> 00:17:40,775
Hey, Dad, um,

405
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,480
mind if I leave early
to meet up with Sarah

406
00:17:43,485 --> 00:17:45,081
at Harvest Fest?

407
00:17:45,086 --> 00:17:46,881
Uh...

408
00:17:46,886 --> 00:17:49,316
any chance this meetup is, like, a...

409
00:17:49,321 --> 00:17:50,685
like a date?

410
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,321
I don't know. Maybe.

411
00:17:53,326 --> 00:17:54,718
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

412
00:17:54,723 --> 00:17:55,723
- Yes.
- Yeah?

413
00:17:55,728 --> 00:17:57,057
Yeah!

414
00:17:57,062 --> 00:17:58,626
- All right, all right.
- Okay, yes!

415
00:17:58,631 --> 00:18:00,161
- Yes, of course you can!
- All right, Dad. Dad.

416
00:18:00,165 --> 00:18:01,497
What, what? This is what I was talking

417
00:18:01,501 --> 00:18:02,798
- about, Harvest Festival.
- Be cool.

418
00:18:02,802 --> 00:18:03,899
If I have to hear anything else

419
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,466
about this stupid Harvest Fest.

420
00:18:05,471 --> 00:18:09,136
- Jon.
- Farming or community or

421
00:18:09,141 --> 00:18:11,806
basically anything else
about this backwards-ass town.

422
00:18:11,811 --> 00:18:13,107
Hey.

423
00:18:13,112 --> 00:18:15,842
I'm sorry about Eliza.

424
00:18:15,847 --> 00:18:17,444
It's not about that, Dad.

425
00:18:17,449 --> 00:18:19,045
I wanna move back.

426
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,014
I lost all my friends.

427
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:22,817
I'm probably never gonna
play football again,

428
00:18:22,821 --> 00:18:24,481
and... and now, what? You just expect me

429
00:18:24,486 --> 00:18:26,286
to drop my life for everyone else's?

430
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,069
Look, I know, I know. A lot has changed.

431
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:29,836
But I promise you,
it's all gonna work out.

432
00:18:29,841 --> 00:18:30,892
You don't know that!

433
00:18:30,896 --> 00:18:32,797
I get it. There was a time in my life

434
00:18:32,802 --> 00:18:34,198
when I felt just like you.

435
00:18:34,203 --> 00:18:35,665
Yeah, well, I'm sure. When was that?

436
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,996
When you were, I don't know,

437
00:18:37,001 --> 00:18:38,298
lifting an oil tanker

438
00:18:38,303 --> 00:18:39,999
or maybe flying laps around Saturn?

439
00:18:40,004 --> 00:18:41,401
- Jonathan...
- No, Dad!

440
00:18:41,406 --> 00:18:43,319
I'm not like you, and
I'm not like Superboy

441
00:18:43,324 --> 00:18:44,354
over there, okay?

442
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,822
And this town?

443
00:18:45,827 --> 00:18:48,957
It is my kryptonite. I hate it.

444
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,317
Look, Dad, um...

445
00:18:58,322 --> 00:19:02,054
Bryan Kelso's older brother
has a place, okay?

446
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:04,389
He just graduated from Met U,
there's a spare bedroom.

447
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:05,958
It's just outside of downtown.

448
00:19:05,963 --> 00:19:07,225
I... I was thinking,

449
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,861
maybe I could just stay with them.

450
00:19:08,866 --> 00:19:10,292
Uh, no, no.

451
00:19:10,297 --> 00:19:11,997
You are not going to stay
with the Kelsos.

452
00:19:12,002 --> 00:19:13,299
You know what? Maybe I'll just do it

453
00:19:13,303 --> 00:19:15,233
anyways, then, because
that's what Jordan did

454
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:18,337
with football, and you let him
get away with it.

455
00:19:18,342 --> 00:19:20,205
Whatever. Jordan, come on.

456
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,598
If this Harvest Fest is so awesome,

457
00:19:21,602 --> 00:19:23,342
let's go have some real fun.

458
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,178
Go.

459
00:19:26,183 --> 00:19:27,479
Thanks.

460
00:19:28,718 --> 00:19:30,282
Will you listen to me?

461
00:19:30,287 --> 00:19:33,118
We've talked about this, Clark.

462
00:19:33,123 --> 00:19:36,188
You can't be running around
playing masked vigilante.

463
00:19:36,193 --> 00:19:38,623
- They were stealing!
- I understand that,

464
00:19:38,628 --> 00:19:41,293
but we've got rules in this family.

465
00:19:41,298 --> 00:19:42,894
Those were Dad's rules,

466
00:19:42,899 --> 00:19:44,296
and he's not here anymore.

467
00:19:44,301 --> 00:19:46,131
That doesn't mean you get to ignore

468
00:19:46,136 --> 00:19:47,499
everything he taught you.

469
00:19:47,504 --> 00:19:49,267
It's been a year. You know?

470
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,303
We can't keep pretending
everything's the same.

471
00:19:51,308 --> 00:19:53,638
We have to move on with our lives.

472
00:19:53,643 --> 00:19:56,140
Moving on can be a distraction.

473
00:19:56,145 --> 00:19:57,975
Sometimes to heal, you've gotta...

474
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,075
you've gotta sit with
the feeling, you know?

475
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,380
- Let it run its course.
- Dad understood.

476
00:20:02,385 --> 00:20:05,049
He knew I was sent here for a reason.

477
00:20:05,054 --> 00:20:06,884
Your father and I both knew

478
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:08,886
you were sent here for a reason.

479
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:10,088
Well, I'm pretty sure that reason

480
00:20:10,092 --> 00:20:12,326
wasn't to be Martha Kent's son.

481
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:19,593
Thank you for all your hard work.

482
00:20:19,598 --> 00:20:21,298
Clark is gonna be so surprised.

483
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,866
Okay, I'll see you soon.

484
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:24,502
I'm sorry I'm late, babe.

485
00:20:24,507 --> 00:20:26,370
It's okay. How's Mitch?

486
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:29,372
Well, he... he took in a lot of smoke.

487
00:20:29,377 --> 00:20:31,974
Doc's a little worried
that the lung damage

488
00:20:31,979 --> 00:20:34,544
- might be permanent.
- Oh, God.

489
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:36,412
Yeah, it's... it's a lot questions

490
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:37,914
as to whether or not

491
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,483
he's gonna be able
to come back to the station.

492
00:20:40,488 --> 00:20:42,221
I'm sorry.

493
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,058
Aww.

494
00:20:46,644 --> 00:20:48,207
Have you been drinking?

495
00:20:48,212 --> 00:20:50,811
Y... yeah, you know, me
and Tamara and the boys,

496
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:53,596
I mean, we went out and
had a drink in his honor.

497
00:20:53,601 --> 00:20:56,566
Smells like you had
a little more than one.

498
00:20:56,571 --> 00:20:58,701
L... let me just get a quick bite,

499
00:20:58,706 --> 00:21:01,837
- get showered up...
- I have people waiting on me.

500
00:21:01,842 --> 00:21:03,538
We're trying to figure out what to do

501
00:21:03,543 --> 00:21:04,707
- about the donations we lost.
- Come on, babe.

502
00:21:04,711 --> 00:21:06,675
It's been a long, hard day.

503
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,843
Okay? Just...

504
00:21:07,848 --> 00:21:09,078
it'll only take a minute.

505
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,348
Mom?

506
00:21:11,685 --> 00:21:13,352
Just take Soph.

507
00:21:15,255 --> 00:21:17,519
- Let me just...
- No, I got it.

508
00:21:17,524 --> 00:21:19,557
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

509
00:21:23,629 --> 00:21:26,694
_

510
00:21:39,044 --> 00:21:41,476
I really hope she's not
having second thoughts.

511
00:21:41,481 --> 00:21:43,544
Jordan, she's the one
who asked you, man.

512
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:45,779
Just have a... have a shred
of confidence, okay?

513
00:21:45,784 --> 00:21:47,215
Hey, look. It's the Kent sisters.

514
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,050
Yo.

515
00:21:49,055 --> 00:21:50,985
- What's up, boys?
- Got your text, QB2.

516
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,420
We are locked and loaded.

517
00:21:52,425 --> 00:21:53,720
- Hell, yeah.
- Better drink up

518
00:21:53,725 --> 00:21:55,225
before the big game.

519
00:21:56,495 --> 00:21:59,025
Are you sure that's a good idea tonight?

520
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,627
Uh...

521
00:22:00,632 --> 00:22:02,896
Thanks for looking out, Mom.

522
00:22:02,901 --> 00:22:04,164
Mm.

523
00:22:07,805 --> 00:22:09,969
- Why don't you go find Sarah?
- Fine.

524
00:22:09,974 --> 00:22:12,572
You do you, party guy.
We'll see how that goes.

525
00:22:12,577 --> 00:22:13,706
We'll see.

526
00:22:13,711 --> 00:22:15,108
Okay, we will.

527
00:22:15,113 --> 00:22:16,376
Yeah.

528
00:22:24,756 --> 00:22:26,453
Dad?

529
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,223
Hey. Thanks.

530
00:22:30,027 --> 00:22:32,994
Hey, you, sit... sit down
for just a minute.

531
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,800
Hey, you remember that song
I used to sing you

532
00:22:40,804 --> 00:22:42,204
when you were a little girl?

533
00:22:43,006 --> 00:22:46,672

534
00:22:46,677 --> 00:22:50,882

Dad, stop!

538
00:23:02,858 --> 00:23:05,092
That was a long time ago.

539
00:23:05,995 --> 00:23:08,629
Yeah, time really does fly, doesn't it?

540
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:11,563
I should get going.

541
00:23:11,568 --> 00:23:13,601
Yeah.

542
00:23:14,804 --> 00:23:17,371
Yeah, I'll be... I'll be right
behind you, mi hijita.

543
00:23:18,441 --> 00:23:19,904
Yeah.

544
00:23:34,624 --> 00:23:35,953
I started that fire.

545
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,487
If he finds out it was me...

546
00:23:37,492 --> 00:23:39,456
Nothing is going to happen to you.

547
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:41,491
This was an accident.

548
00:23:41,496 --> 00:23:42,692
But if I can't control it...

549
00:23:42,697 --> 00:23:44,894
We can fix this.

550
00:23:44,899 --> 00:23:46,396
Follow me.

551
00:23:56,612 --> 00:23:58,077
Gotcha.

552
00:24:27,393 --> 00:24:29,490
I'm sorry about earlier, Clark.

553
00:24:29,495 --> 00:24:31,088
It's okay, Mom. I shouldn't have gotten

554
00:24:31,093 --> 00:24:32,393
so upset, and you were right...

555
00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:35,028
No, no, just listen to me.

556
00:24:35,033 --> 00:24:36,863
I didn't want to admit that

557
00:24:36,868 --> 00:24:40,273
this home isn't the best place
for you anymore.

558
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:42,636
You are special,

559
00:24:42,641 --> 00:24:46,440
and I know you're meant
for... for bigger things.

560
00:24:46,445 --> 00:24:49,476
And that time might have come.

561
00:24:49,481 --> 00:24:50,611
What is this?

562
00:24:50,616 --> 00:24:51,945
Your father found it

563
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,380
in the pod when you arrived.

564
00:24:53,385 --> 00:24:54,515
I don't know what it does

565
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,216
or what it's for, I just...

566
00:24:56,221 --> 00:24:58,719
I just know it belongs to you.

567
00:24:58,724 --> 00:25:02,389
And it might be the key to figuring out

568
00:25:02,394 --> 00:25:04,358
what your future is.

569
00:25:14,606 --> 00:25:16,603
Hey, hey, Lana. How are you?

570
00:25:16,608 --> 00:25:17,870
- Hey, Cobb.
- How are you?

571
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:18,971
I'm good.

572
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:20,240
I, uh...

573
00:25:20,245 --> 00:25:22,308
I heard about Mitch.

574
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:24,176
- It's a damn shame.
- Yeah.

575
00:25:24,181 --> 00:25:25,611
Listen, um...

576
00:25:25,616 --> 00:25:27,112
is Kyle gonna be here tonight, or...

577
00:25:27,117 --> 00:25:29,716
Oh, he... he wanted
to stay at the hospital.

578
00:25:29,721 --> 00:25:31,221
He's a good man, that Kyle.

579
00:25:31,226 --> 00:25:33,285
He is.

580
00:25:40,148 --> 00:25:41,245
- Hey.
- Hey!

581
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,830
I'm really sorry I'm late.

582
00:25:43,835 --> 00:25:45,598
It's all right. You okay?

583
00:25:45,603 --> 00:25:47,069
No, not really.

584
00:25:47,972 --> 00:25:50,301
Um, but, I don't really wanna do

585
00:25:50,306 --> 00:25:52,371
sad stories tonight, so.

586
00:25:52,376 --> 00:25:54,184
All right.

587
00:25:54,189 --> 00:25:56,174
My dad can't shut up about these.

588
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,543
You probably shouldn't eat

589
00:25:57,547 --> 00:25:59,944
anything here that's on a stick.

590
00:25:59,949 --> 00:26:02,213
Come on, let me buy you
some elephant ears.

591
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:04,717
All right.

592
00:26:04,721 --> 00:26:06,017
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

593
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,486
- Yeah, that sounds great.
- Okay.

594
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,204
What makes you think this
time, it'll be any different?

595
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:27,571
Trust me.

596
00:26:50,433 --> 00:26:52,184
You know, I think I'm
starting to see what my dad

597
00:26:52,188 --> 00:26:54,188
saw in this place.

598
00:26:54,193 --> 00:26:56,557
From this? Really?

599
00:26:57,997 --> 00:26:59,893
It's pretty great.

600
00:27:04,979 --> 00:27:06,476
Look,

601
00:27:06,481 --> 00:27:09,014
about earlier...

602
00:27:09,984 --> 00:27:12,148
everything's not okay.

603
00:27:14,255 --> 00:27:15,852
It's just...

604
00:27:15,857 --> 00:27:17,784
I don't know, the sheer weight

605
00:27:17,789 --> 00:27:20,655
of all of the really bad things
that are going on in my life,

606
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,826
and I'm pretty sure that
my therapist is tired of

607
00:27:22,831 --> 00:27:24,828
hearing me talk about the same stuff.

608
00:27:26,501 --> 00:27:28,197
So, try me.

609
00:27:28,202 --> 00:27:29,899
Well...

610
00:27:29,904 --> 00:27:31,368
okay. My dad, he...

611
00:27:31,373 --> 00:27:33,602
Yo, yo, guys, look!
It's everybody's favorite

612
00:27:33,607 --> 00:27:36,104
Kent brother. It's Mr. Charming, baby!

613
00:27:36,109 --> 00:27:37,606
- Look at this guy.
- Hey, hey, hey.

614
00:27:37,611 --> 00:27:39,140
Not now, all right? Not now, please.

615
00:27:39,145 --> 00:27:40,839
Whoa, whoa, relax, relax, relax, relax.

616
00:27:40,844 --> 00:27:41,845
Chill, chill, chill, chill. Look.

617
00:27:41,849 --> 00:27:43,679
Guys, guys, guys. Get this.

618
00:27:43,684 --> 00:27:45,981
It's this guy's first date ever.

619
00:27:45,986 --> 00:27:47,036
It's his first date!

620
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:48,103
What?

621
00:27:48,108 --> 00:27:49,609
First-timer.

622
00:27:52,058 --> 00:27:54,122
Wow. You can't go one weekend

623
00:27:54,127 --> 00:27:55,457
without partying like idiots?

624
00:27:55,462 --> 00:27:56,925
It's kind of pathetic.

625
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,795
- Sarah, hey, look, you need...
- Don't touch me!

626
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,296
- Hey, we're just kidding.
- Don't talk to me like that!

627
00:28:01,301 --> 00:28:03,362
Look, uh, he's... he's having

628
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:04,868
a really rough day,
that's all this is, okay?

629
00:28:04,872 --> 00:28:06,301
Oh, you're having a rough day?

630
00:28:06,306 --> 00:28:08,436
You have no idea what
real problems are like.

631
00:28:08,441 --> 00:28:10,639
For people who don't come
from a picture-perfect family

632
00:28:10,643 --> 00:28:12,007
like you,

633
00:28:12,012 --> 00:28:14,243
you all can just get drunk
and act like total idiots

634
00:28:14,247 --> 00:28:16,844
and think that there's never
any consequences?

635
00:28:16,849 --> 00:28:18,046
Yo, Sarah,

636
00:28:18,051 --> 00:28:19,415
we were just... we were just kidding.

637
00:28:19,419 --> 00:28:20,419
I'm... I'm sorry.

638
00:28:20,424 --> 00:28:21,453
Save it. Have fun.

639
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:23,524
Talk to you later. Move!

640
00:28:24,324 --> 00:28:25,620
- Wait, Sarah...
- Jordan.

641
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:27,555
- Hey, Jordan!
- What, what, what?

642
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,823
Jordan.

643
00:28:28,828 --> 00:28:31,492
Look, I'm... I'm sorry, man. I didn't...

644
00:28:31,497 --> 00:28:34,661
I didn't mean to ruin
your night like that.

645
00:28:34,666 --> 00:28:36,730
I'm sorry.

646
00:28:38,703 --> 00:28:40,401
It's all right.

647
00:28:40,406 --> 00:28:41,701
Let's just...

648
00:28:41,706 --> 00:28:43,303
let's just get you some water.

649
00:28:43,308 --> 00:28:44,871
- Okay?
- Okay.

650
00:28:44,876 --> 00:28:45,939
I'm sorry.

651
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,580
You're right. These are
severely underrated.

652
00:28:53,585 --> 00:28:55,815
- Right?
- Yes.

653
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,751
- You talk to Jonathan?
- Whoa!

654
00:28:57,756 --> 00:28:59,053
Um, yeah.

655
00:28:59,058 --> 00:29:01,421
He wants to move back to Metropolis.

656
00:29:01,426 --> 00:29:02,556
He said that?

657
00:29:02,561 --> 00:29:04,157
Yeah, among other things.

658
00:29:04,162 --> 00:29:06,262
Here he comes.

659
00:29:07,154 --> 00:29:09,718
Oh, and he's been drinking.

660
00:29:09,723 --> 00:29:11,253
What?

661
00:29:11,258 --> 00:29:12,930
You've been drinking?

662
00:29:12,935 --> 00:29:14,665
- What?
- Your dad can smell it.

663
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,570
I can smell it. The whole
town can smell it.

664
00:29:16,575 --> 00:29:17,971
It's... it's not that big a deal.

665
00:29:17,976 --> 00:29:19,839
- Excuse me?
- Okay, both of you,

666
00:29:19,844 --> 00:29:22,241
call a rideshare and go home right now.

667
00:29:22,246 --> 00:29:24,143
- Yes, ma'am.
- Fine, we were going anyway.

668
00:29:24,148 --> 00:29:25,148
Go faster!

669
00:29:26,484 --> 00:29:27,981
Chrissy, now is not a good time.

670
00:29:27,986 --> 00:29:30,616
Okay, so, Sharon Powell
came into the office

671
00:29:30,621 --> 00:29:33,519
and I, like, totally sleuthed
my way onto her phone

672
00:29:33,524 --> 00:29:35,153
to get Derek's location.

673
00:29:35,158 --> 00:29:37,355
So then I thought, "WWLLD",

674
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,054
"what would Lois Lane do",
which is easy,

675
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:40,260
dig deeper and follow the lead,

676
00:29:40,264 --> 00:29:41,694
only I never would've thought

677
00:29:41,699 --> 00:29:44,629
it would lead me to him
making out with Leslie Larr.

678
00:29:44,634 --> 00:29:47,099
Leslie Larr is there with Derek Powell?

679
00:29:47,104 --> 00:29:49,501
Yeah, she took him to this building

680
00:29:49,506 --> 00:29:52,170
where there's this crazy
Bride of Frankenstein machine.

681
00:30:01,218 --> 00:30:02,818
Did it work?

682
00:30:18,204 --> 00:30:19,567
What is this?

683
00:30:19,572 --> 00:30:21,636
Protect the asset.

684
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:33,181
Projectile in motion, sir.

685
00:30:33,186 --> 00:30:35,049
Speed and flight pattern unique

686
00:30:35,054 --> 00:30:37,151
to Kryptonian air mobiles.

687
00:30:37,156 --> 00:30:38,986
Kal-El's here?

688
00:31:24,069 --> 00:31:26,166
- They're two of them?
- It appears so,

689
00:31:26,171 --> 00:31:28,701
though I have still yet
to identify the other.

690
00:31:28,706 --> 00:31:30,737
- Where'd they go?
- Flight algorithm suggests

691
00:31:30,742 --> 00:31:32,371
a five-mile circumference.

692
00:31:32,376 --> 00:31:34,841
Continue on this road,
and we'll intersect

693
00:31:34,846 --> 00:31:36,475
in 23 seconds.

694
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,543
Take over.

695
00:31:37,548 --> 00:31:39,345
Auto-drive engaged.

696
00:31:52,396 --> 00:31:53,592
What did she do to you?

697
00:31:53,597 --> 00:31:56,229
She resurrected me, Kal-El.

698
00:31:56,234 --> 00:31:58,200
You're not alone anymore.

699
00:32:22,659 --> 00:32:24,555
45 degrees southeast,

700
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,558
in three, two, one.

701
00:32:27,563 --> 00:32:29,594
Fire.

702
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,214
I can help you.

703
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:53,350
No, you can't.

704
00:32:53,355 --> 00:32:55,786
I'm already dead.

705
00:32:58,027 --> 00:32:59,489
Ah!

706
00:32:59,494 --> 00:33:01,125
No! Wait, wait, wait!

707
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:27,481
I guess Harvest Fest
was kind of a bust, huh?

708
00:33:31,255 --> 00:33:32,688
Hey.

709
00:33:33,424 --> 00:33:36,258
I just wanted to say that...

710
00:33:37,461 --> 00:33:39,125
I'm... I'm really sorry

711
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:41,430
- and I promise that...
- Stop.

712
00:33:42,867 --> 00:33:44,230
It's okay.

713
00:33:44,235 --> 00:33:47,433
This is your one
"get out of jail free" card.

714
00:33:47,438 --> 00:33:48,467
It is?

715
00:33:48,472 --> 00:33:49,569
Wait, seriously?

716
00:33:49,573 --> 00:33:50,769
Jonathan, I told you,

717
00:33:50,774 --> 00:33:53,071
I know how you feel, and I do.

718
00:33:53,076 --> 00:33:54,752
When I was just a couple
years older than you,

719
00:33:54,756 --> 00:33:56,089
I did leave home.

720
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,910
- Why?
- Lots of reasons.

721
00:33:58,915 --> 00:34:01,880
The main one was that I needed
to become someone else.

722
00:34:01,885 --> 00:34:04,816
Someone I thought was more
important than Clark Kent.

723
00:34:04,821 --> 00:34:07,553
And to do that,
I had to leave Smallville.

724
00:34:07,558 --> 00:34:08,887
And he never came back.

725
00:34:08,892 --> 00:34:10,789
I still think about that decision.

726
00:34:10,794 --> 00:34:12,190
That time that I gave up

727
00:34:12,195 --> 00:34:13,726
with my mom, I never got it back.

728
00:34:13,731 --> 00:34:16,194
She only had so much time to give,

729
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,433
and she sacrificed it for me.

730
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:21,634
Jonathan, you have your own path.

731
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:23,402
And it might not feel like it right now,

732
00:34:23,406 --> 00:34:25,503
but I know it's gonna
lead to great things.

733
00:34:25,508 --> 00:34:28,573
All I'm asking is that you give
Smallville a little more time.

734
00:34:28,578 --> 00:34:31,108
If, after that, things
still aren't working out,

735
00:34:31,113 --> 00:34:33,381
then we can discuss other options.

736
00:34:35,285 --> 00:34:37,515
- Okay.
- Okay.

737
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,553
Right, I wanna give you something.

738
00:34:40,556 --> 00:34:42,754
Something from that time in my life.

739
00:34:50,065 --> 00:34:51,629
Dad, there's nothing in here.

740
00:34:51,634 --> 00:34:53,230
The box is the gift.

741
00:34:53,235 --> 00:34:55,633
Your granddad gave that
to my mom when he proposed.

742
00:34:55,638 --> 00:34:57,535
And she gave it to me

743
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,604
when it was my time to leave.

744
00:34:59,609 --> 00:35:00,970
Wow.

745
00:35:02,577 --> 00:35:04,475
All right, it's getting late,
you better go upstairs

746
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:07,079
before we change our minds
about that punishment.

747
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:09,313
Thanks, Dad.

748
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,752
See ya.

749
00:35:15,357 --> 00:35:16,856
Softy.

750
00:35:17,793 --> 00:35:19,326
I know.

751
00:35:25,734 --> 00:35:29,132
I'm still trying to process
what happened to Derek Powell.

752
00:35:30,772 --> 00:35:33,437
I feel so bad for his mom.

753
00:35:36,076 --> 00:35:39,077
Can't believe he just
killed himself like that.

754
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:41,610
I don't think it was Derek.

755
00:35:41,615 --> 00:35:43,813
- It was his body.
- Yeah, but his powers

756
00:35:43,818 --> 00:35:45,948
were erratic, like Tag Harris.

757
00:35:45,953 --> 00:35:48,784
And he said he'd been resurrected...

758
00:35:48,789 --> 00:35:50,219
whatever that means.

759
00:35:50,224 --> 00:35:52,154
Well, whatever Edge and Leslie are doing

760
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:54,724
with that machine, it has
something to do with the mines.

761
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:04,199
Hey.

762
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:05,334
Hi.

763
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:06,435
I know it isn't much,

764
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,136
but every little bit helps, right?

765
00:36:08,141 --> 00:36:10,638
Aw, thank you. That's so thoughtful.

766
00:36:10,643 --> 00:36:12,175
Just wish that we could
replace everything

767
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:13,675
that was lost in the fire.

768
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,944
Oh, you're never gonna believe this.

769
00:36:15,949 --> 00:36:18,180
- We already have.
- What?

770
00:36:18,185 --> 00:36:20,382
- How?
- Morgan Edge.

771
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:22,117
He heard about what happened

772
00:36:22,122 --> 00:36:24,552
and wrote a check to replace everything,

773
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:25,820
and then some.

774
00:36:25,825 --> 00:36:27,189
Very generous.

775
00:36:27,194 --> 00:36:30,458
I... I guess he just wanted to help.

776
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:33,929
Okay, come with me.

777
00:36:33,934 --> 00:36:36,698
One last donation you need to see.

778
00:36:39,206 --> 00:36:40,668
Okay?

779
00:36:43,676 --> 00:36:45,006
As you know,

780
00:36:45,011 --> 00:36:47,041
the Harvest Festival was your mom's

781
00:36:47,046 --> 00:36:48,576
favorite time of the year,

782
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,945
and we really feel her absence.

783
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:55,082
Martha Kent was everything
this town aspires to be.

784
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:56,751
She was kind,

785
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,119
she was generous,

786
00:36:58,124 --> 00:37:01,222
and she was always there
when you needed her.

787
00:37:01,227 --> 00:37:03,458
Everyone in Smallville

788
00:37:03,463 --> 00:37:05,960
can remember her sitting right here,

789
00:37:05,965 --> 00:37:08,162
talking with and laughing with

790
00:37:08,167 --> 00:37:10,298
whoever was right there beside her.

791
00:37:10,303 --> 00:37:13,367
And though she is no longer
physically with us,

792
00:37:13,372 --> 00:37:16,671
her spirit remains, and she will be

793
00:37:16,676 --> 00:37:19,473
right here for whoever needs her.

794
00:37:19,478 --> 00:37:22,476
_

795
00:37:25,517 --> 00:37:28,015
Did you know about this?

796
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,417
Are you gonna sit down?

797
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,470
The train will be here any minute.

798
00:37:47,406 --> 00:37:48,502
Clark?

799
00:37:52,577 --> 00:37:54,677
It's time, Clark.

800
00:38:20,705 --> 00:38:23,069
I was so selfish.

801
00:38:23,074 --> 00:38:24,637
Everybody is at that age.

802
00:38:24,642 --> 00:38:26,405
It's part of growing up.

803
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:28,607
Yeah, but Mom knew that.

804
00:38:28,612 --> 00:38:30,775
And she let me go anyway.

805
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,815
Because she loved you and
she wanted you to be happy.

806
00:38:34,918 --> 00:38:37,116
And now we're at the point where

807
00:38:37,121 --> 00:38:39,651
our own kids are talking
about leaving home.

808
00:38:39,656 --> 00:38:41,387
It feels like they were just born.

809
00:38:41,392 --> 00:38:43,422
It's easy for you to say,
you didn't have to go

810
00:38:43,427 --> 00:38:45,157
through 27 hours of labor.

811
00:38:45,162 --> 00:38:47,026
That's true.

812
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,367
Love you.

813
00:38:55,372 --> 00:38:56,971
Love you too.

814
00:39:09,985 --> 00:39:12,483
Biometric readings

815
00:39:12,488 --> 00:39:14,752
suggests your pulse is abnormally high.

816
00:39:14,757 --> 00:39:16,354
This must be

817
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:18,089
- about Lois Lane.
- Hmm.

818
00:39:18,094 --> 00:39:20,591
It is worth reminding
you that this is not

819
00:39:20,596 --> 00:39:22,626
the Lois Lane from your world.

820
00:39:22,631 --> 00:39:24,866
Everything about her is the same.

821
00:39:26,302 --> 00:39:28,966
Everything, except she
marries someone else.

822
00:39:28,971 --> 00:39:30,268
Come back to me.

823
00:39:30,273 --> 00:39:31,502
I always do.

824
00:39:34,043 --> 00:39:36,941
There are other variables
that you have not t...

825
00:39:43,518 --> 00:39:47,084
I'm glad that Jon
didn't get into trouble.

826
00:39:47,089 --> 00:39:48,819
Yeah.

827
00:39:48,824 --> 00:39:52,192
Uh, my dad was pretty cool
about it, it was nice.

828
00:39:54,329 --> 00:39:56,460
Can you tell Jon that I'm sorry?

829
00:39:56,465 --> 00:39:59,997
I didn't... I didn't mean
to get so mad at him.

830
00:40:00,002 --> 00:40:01,966
It's no big deal.

831
00:40:01,971 --> 00:40:03,770
It kind of is, though.

832
00:40:08,142 --> 00:40:10,106
I know that I asked you out on the date,

833
00:40:10,111 --> 00:40:12,942
only to completely
and totally ruin it, but,

834
00:40:12,947 --> 00:40:16,679
I think I could really just use a friend

835
00:40:16,684 --> 00:40:18,451
more than anything else.

836
00:40:19,988 --> 00:40:21,386
Yeah.

837
00:40:22,389 --> 00:40:25,054
Yeah, um...

838
00:40:25,059 --> 00:40:29,058
well, as long as we still get
to spend some time together.

839
00:40:29,063 --> 00:40:32,428
Yeah, I do believe that
that's what friends do.

840
00:40:32,433 --> 00:40:34,097
So...

841
00:40:34,102 --> 00:40:35,866
You know, you were the one
that ruined the date.

842
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,497
Hey! So now you don't

843
00:40:37,502 --> 00:40:39,702
- want to be friends?
- Eh, you know...

844
00:40:39,707 --> 00:40:42,504
I'll think about it.

845
00:40:42,509 --> 00:40:44,072
Mm-kay.

846
00:40:59,492 --> 00:41:00,559
Tag?

847
00:41:01,561 --> 00:41:03,759
- What did you do to me?
- What?

848
00:41:07,267 --> 00:41:08,329
- Tell me!
- Hey, man.

849
00:41:08,334 --> 00:41:09,531
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

850
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,120
Greg, move your head!
