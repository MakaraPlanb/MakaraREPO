1396
01:12:34,398 --> 01:12:35,997
And <i>Ah Ma</i> thought
I would not make

1397
01:12:35,999 --> 01:12:37,632
an adequate wife to her son.

1398
01:12:37,634 --> 01:12:40,703
But she came around,
obviously.

1399
01:12:43,307 --> 01:12:45,839
It took many years,

1400
01:12:45,841 --> 01:12:48,643
and she had good reason
to be concerned.

1401
01:12:48,645 --> 01:12:51,779
Because I had no idea
the work

1402
01:12:51,781 --> 01:12:54,815
and the sacrifice
it would take.

1403
01:12:54,817 --> 01:12:57,052
There were many days
when I wondered

1404
01:12:57,054 --> 01:13:00,155
if I would ever measure up.

1405
01:13:00,157 --> 01:13:02,825
But having been through
it all,

1406
01:13:03,793 --> 01:13:05,828

You will never be enough.

1408
01:13:18,308 --> 01:13:22,778
We should head back.
I wouldn't want Nick to worry.

1411
01:13:44,268 --> 01:13:46,067
I know my mum
can be tough at times,

1412
01:13:46,069 --> 01:13:50,771
but there isn't anything
she wouldn't do for me.

1413
01:13:50,773 --> 01:13:54,376
And there is a reason why
I lived with <i>Ah Ma</i> growing up.

1414
01:13:54,378 --> 01:13:57,811
It's because my mother knew
she wasn't the favorite.

1415
01:13:57,813 --> 01:14:01,351
So she let her raise me,
so I would be.

1416
01:14:02,886 --> 01:14:04,886
You were just a kid?

1417
01:14:04,888 --> 01:14:07,155
Yeah.

1418
01:14:07,157 --> 01:14:11,827
But it's hard to understand
from the outside.

1419
01:14:14,097 --> 01:14:17,165
But she did what she thought
was best for the family.

1420
