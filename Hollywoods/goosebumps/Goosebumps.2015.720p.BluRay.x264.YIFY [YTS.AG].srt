from him since, you know?

00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:28,612
Where do I begin?
When I was younger,

753
00:41:28,645 --> 00:41:31,081
I suffered from terrible
allergies that kept me indoors.

754
00:41:31,115 --> 00:41:34,551
And all the kids
threw rocks at my window

755
00:41:34,585 --> 00:41:36,720
and called me names.

756
00:41:36,754 --> 00:41:38,689
So I created my own friends.

757
00:41:38,722 --> 00:41:43,527
Monsters, demons, ghouls
to terrorize my neighborhood

758
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,229
and all the kids
that made fun of me.

759
00:41:45,262 --> 00:41:48,966
And they became real to me.

760
00:41:48,999 --> 00:41:52,669
And then one day,
they actually...

761
00:41:52,703 --> 00:41:57,207
became real.

762
00:42:00,144 --> 00:42:03,213
My monsters literally
leapt off the page.

763
00:42:03,247 --> 00:42:05,849
As long as the books
remain locked, we're safe.

764

766
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:15,692

Oh, what did I have for you?

There it is.

My name is Mr. R. L. Stine,

and I will be your new
English teacher,

1621
01:32:57,198 --> 01:32:59,600
because Mr. Boyd is still
recuperating from injuries

1622
01:32:59,633 --> 01:33:04,772
sustained in a
mutant-insect attack.

Uh, who was that?

He's the new

- Can I ask you something?
- Of course.

1634

Do you miss her?

1635
01:33:40,241 --> 01:33:42,643
Not a day goes by

And also right over there.

1641
