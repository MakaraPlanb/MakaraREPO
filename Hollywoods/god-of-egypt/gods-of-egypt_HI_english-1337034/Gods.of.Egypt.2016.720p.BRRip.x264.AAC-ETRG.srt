it goes something like this...</i>

3
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,791
<i>Before history began,</i>

4
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,758
<i>Egypt was the birthplace of all life.</i>

5
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,350
<i>A paradise worthy of the gods
who created it.</i>

6
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,670
<i>So the gods
decided to live there</i>

7
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,553
<i>alongside their
lesser creation, man.</i>

8
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,309
<i>But there was no mistaking the gods
amongst the mortals who worshipped them.</i>

9
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,791
<i>The gods were taller with gold running
through their veins instead of blood.</i>

10
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,228
<i>And they could transform at will
into all manner of frightening beasts.</i>

11
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,468
<i>Egypt itself was divided
between two mighty brothers.</i>

12
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,757
<i>Osiris, the God of Life,
was the beloved king</i>

13
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,876
<i>of all the lands
made bountiful by the Nile.</i>

14
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,513
<i>His brother, Set,
ruled the far barren desert</i>

15
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,116
<i>finding both strength
and bitterness in his isolation.</i>

16
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,431
<i>But then the time came
for Osiris to crown a new king.</i>

17

18

test the brothers' bond</i>

985
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:45,189
the God of Wisdom to come but he was
afraid he'd get the answer wrong.

986

This is the cleverest strategy
you could devise?

987
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:52,238

How vain do you think I am?

He deserves

Why do you think Set let you live?

1025
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:17,596
She did it for love.
You'd punish her for that?

1026

I didn't want her help.

01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:36,953
From this moment on, the Afterlife
must be earned, not with gold,

1475
01:55:37,880 --> 01:55:43,238
but by good deeds,
compassion, and generosity.

1476
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:47,757
What we do, how we act
in this life matters.

Are you thinking about her?

1479
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:00,280
Of course, you are.

1480
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:06,909
You didn't think I'd misplace
Egypt's greatest treasure?

1481
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:10,915
You think they'd miss me
if I were gone a few days?

1482
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,070
As Chief Advisor to the King,

1483
01:56:13,160 --> 01:56:15,071
it's my duty to ensure
they hardly notice.

1485
01:56:17,320 --> 01:56:18,958
Tell them I had
to go help a friend.

1486
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:24,795
I leave Egypt
in your capable hands.
