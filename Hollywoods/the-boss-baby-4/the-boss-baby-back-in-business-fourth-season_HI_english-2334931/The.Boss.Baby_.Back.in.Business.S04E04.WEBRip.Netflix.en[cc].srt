I don't know, Board, should we let him in?

Please! Let him enter!

Ow.

00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,342
[Boss Baby] Everyone got stung that day.

00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,844
And me?

40
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,679
I got stung with an idea.

41
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:21,641
The name "The Hive" has become so toxic,
Midge Marksberry is holding

42
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:25,395
a speech contest
for fans to propose a new name.

43
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:30,108
We're going to win the contest
and name that team the Babies.

I'm honored you approve.

49
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:46,457
I've already recruited my brother
to enter the contest, so--

50
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:50,003
Wait, you're placing the fate
of this most incredible plan

51
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,629
in the hands of a mere child?

52
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,589
Of course not.

53
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,842
Tim is just the mouthpiece
for one of the greatest pieces of oratory

54
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,218
the world will ever hear.

55
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,220
I guarantee victory.

56
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,515
How can you possibly make
such a guarantee?

57
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,435
Because every word of that speech
has been engineered

58
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:10,023
for maximum crowd-pleasing efficiency
by a crack team of brainstormers,

59
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:13,693
my "Managed Outcomes
and Contingencies Team"!

60
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,195
I call them the "What-Ifsters" for short.

61
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,823
Their job is to imagine
every possible outcome,

62
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,034
mostly bad, and find a solution.

63
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,702
Staci, the speech.

64
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,998
"The time has come for a team
that reflects our core values."

65
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,541
I can already tell this is a winner.

66
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:29,667
You better believe it.

67
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,253
"Our team is the heart
and we are the blood."

68
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,756
I cannot wait to give this speech.
What could go wrong?

69
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,007
Excellent question!

70
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,634
What if you stumble over the words?

71
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,095
Just laugh to release the tension
and try again.

72
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,391
Okay, but I've never stumbled
speaking in front of people.

73
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,102
-What if someone heckles you?
-That won't happen, right?

74
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:51,314
-You have to be ready if it does!
-Say something nice about the heckler.

75
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,359
Like, "Madam,
you're as beautiful as a walrus!"

"Why, thank you, young sir!"

00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:00,615
Barf bag?

79
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:01,824
What if you barf?

80
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,202
I'm not gonna barf.
I don't think I'm gonna barf.

81
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,746
What if a falcon flies into your face?

82
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,414
This'll help stop the bleeding.

83
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,209
When did falcons in the community center
become a possibility?

84
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:15,004
Can't disregard any what-if.
The stakes are far too high.

85
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,631
[whimpers]

86
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,385
And that's why the team
should be named The Handcuffs.

87
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:24,055
You have the right to remain undefeated!
Thank you.

88
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:29,602

garbage disposal of a speech.

-You got this.

00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:45,994

00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,503
Timothy Templeton!

100
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,130
Stand up here, boy.

101
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,385
Timbo, that's your cue. You okay?

102
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,804
-Do you need to make number twos?
-No!

103
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,724
I just got nervous thinking about
everything that could go wrong,

104
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,475
so I found a substitute to read my speech.

105
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:15,440
Looks like Tim chickened out,
so here's Danny Petroosky.

106

-Sorry.
-It'll be fine.

107
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,279
That speech is so powerful, it would take
a force of nature to mess it up.

108
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,197
It's Petrosky.

109
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,616

Oh, that? [chuckles] Just a setback.

But what if it's too spicy?

00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,868

Contingent on the need to cool our mouths?

What if I get so skinny
that my diaper falls off?

172
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,969
-It's been hours!
-That's good!

173
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,888
It means they're running through
all scenarios

174
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,765
-and narrowing it down to the most--
-[both gasp]

175
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:37,683
Uh-huh. Sure.

176
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:41,395
I don't care what you had for lunch,
but I'm happy your mouths didn't freeze.

177
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,314
Brilliant idea.

178
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:47,109
-Well?
-We need a wagon and a movie-star smile.

179
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,737
And that little girl said to me,

180
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,491
"You have the smile of a woman
in her low to lower 30s."

181
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,951
[laughs]

182
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,537
I don't get it. Is it because you're old?

183
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,998
I am in the prime of my life.

184
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:04,001
I'm 59 and proud as a peacock.

185
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,753
How old are you, 50?

186
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:10,049
This is going to be
such a delightful interview.

187
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,467
I'm Marsha Krinkle.

188
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,511
Today's guests are Midge Marksberry,

189
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,013
the elderly owner
of the local soccer team,

190
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:21,227
and Danny Petrosky, the boy who gave it
a new name: the Hot Dogs.

191
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:25,314
This human idea factory
came up with that name,

192
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,317
and I haven't let him
leave my side since.

193
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,860
Idea! Go!

194
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,862
"Take Home the Chair
You're Sitting In" Night.

195
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,656
"Mustard Burning Mondays."

196
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,742
"Bring a Better Player With You,"
"What's Up? You're Coach Now."

197
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,453
Kid's mind is quicker than a snake bite!

198
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,705
Slow down!

199
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:44,250
The mind saunters a bit as we age, I hear.

200
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,545
How did you come up
with the name Hotdogs, Danny?

201
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,298
Not hotdogs. Hot Dogs.

202
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:54,051
See, my friend Tim wrote the speech for me
with a different team name.

203
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,346
But then, I had an idea: Hotdogs.

204
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,975
But then I thought,
hotdogs are delicious but not fierce,

205
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:04,812
and I'm a diagnosed vesti-cynophobiac,
fear of dogs in clothing,

206
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:08,733
so a dog who is hot
is a pretty ferocious mascot to me.

207
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,693
Boom! Hot Dogs.

208
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,696
-That was a story!
-[Tim clears throat]

209
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,867
Oh! Speaking of my buddy Tim,
I want you guys to meet him.

210
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,620
Well, let's bring him out!

211
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:21,621
Hey, everyone.

212
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,789
In honor of Danny
getting to name the team,

213
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,958
I brought a special breakfast surprise!

214
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,710
[Danny gasps] Hotdogs!

215
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:31,339
To be clear, the team is the Hot Dogs,
totally different.

216
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,716
But you know I can't say no to a hotdog.

217
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,884
I do know that.

218
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,261
[Boss Baby] Is she gonna take it?

219
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,305
She needs a mouthful
if our plan's gonna work.

220
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,308
Come on, likeliest outcome!

221
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,392
[chuckles]

222
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,437
You don't happen to have
a grapefruit in a bun, do you, kid?

223
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,105
I mean, it's 8:00 a.m.!

224
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,525
[slurps] Ah, the time don't matter,
Lizzie Lulu.

225
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:55,154
We're not getting any younger, you know.
[chuckles]

226
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,117
Now work your magic, Timbo.

227
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,412
[Tim] While everyone is chewing, I'd like
to take this opportunity to mention...

228
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,247
that babies are tenacious.

229
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,501
They get what they want,
whether it's a bottle or victory.

230
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:12,004
Most of all, babies are the easiest thing
in the world to love.

231
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:16,175
This town loves our team, and that's why
the team should be called the Babies.

232
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,136
♪ Babies! Babies! Wah-wah-wah! ♪

233
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,013
[scarfs, gulps] I love it!

234
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:25,476
I could get into a team called the Babies,
because I know how tough they can be!

235
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,728
[chuckles] I am a working mom.

236
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:28,813
Babies are tough.

237
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:33,025
The fact that baby Midge Marksberry
survived this crazy world

238
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:37,655
to become 59 years old
is all the proof you need.

239
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,323
I don't know. Now I'm torn.

240
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,952
The Babies or the Hot Dogs.
What do you think, Danny?

241
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,789
[scarfs] I'm all for letting
the best ideas win in this world

242
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:50,292
because, I'll admit, the best ideas
never win in my head.

243
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,129
For example,
I'm going to eat another hotdog.

244
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,089
I can't stop!

245
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,842
You heard it here first, folks.

246
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,052
Team name: to be determined.

247
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,430
-Whoo, man! We did it!
-Yeah! Who da man?

248
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:05,099
But... [sighs] we didn't get
the team name.

249
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:08,018
But we got the Babies back in play!

250
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,896
The door was slammed shut.
We pried it open.

251
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,898
Now we'll brainstorm ways to win!

252
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,108
-Yay!
-Yeah!

253
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,069
-We did it! We're the man!
-Great! Yes!

254
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,112
Now bring it home.

255
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,281
I mean, this should be easy
now that the town

256
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,491
has heard the name the Babies, right?

257
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,869
Nothing but blue skies ahead.

258
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,537
-[man] Hot Dogs!
-[woman] Yeah! Yeah!

259
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,205
Hot Dogs is a better name!

260
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,166
Wrong! Babies!

261
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,834
-Hot Dogs!
-[grunting]

262
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,919
No street fights allowed!

263
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,589
Let's agree on the Babies, or...

264
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,174
I'm taking your butt to jail!

265
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,091
Yes!

266
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,136
No. Hot Dogs! [grunts]

267
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:45,598
Well, then you're under arrest
for assaulting an officer's good taste

268
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:46,724
in team names.

269
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,393
Well, I usurp and cancel this arrest.

270
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,646
We all know this team should be
the Hot Dogs.

271
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,689
I'll pass a law!

272
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,275
Who's gonna enforce it?

273
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,860
Stalemate.

274
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,196
The Babies, you maniac!

275
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,907
♪ Hot Dogs! Hot Dogs! Arf-arf-arf! ♪

276
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,075
More like "barf barf..." [retches]

277
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,369
No, that's what Babies do!

278
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,997
I know. Why do you think
I'm at the pediatrician?

279
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,332
[baby vomits]

280
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,627
When they finally settle on naming
the team the Babies,

281
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,380
I'm buying this whole family
jerseys, hats...

282
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,009
Janice... you're one of them?

283
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:26,680
We are right, and we're everywhere.

284
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:32,478
Excuse me, boys. I'm not hungry.

285
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,858
Grapes en quatre pièces.

286
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,111
Mm. How delicate.

287
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,322
Les mains de dieu.

288
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:46,450
So, this team name thing is bad.

289
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:50,246
We're getting negative baby love readings
from people with babies.

290
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,455
[chuckles]

291
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,707
You think we didn't see this coming?

292
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,293
You saw this coming?

293
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,505
There are so many paths to victory.

294
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:02,550
My What-Ifsters have
a cornucopia of contingencies.

295
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,801
Patience is...

296
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,302
Now! Now! Now!

297
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,805
We gotta end this naming controversy.
Give me what-ifs!

298
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:14,144
What if our universe is a teeny, tiny atom
in something much, much bigger?

299
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:17,273
What if that something bigger
is a giant fart?

300
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,567
What if we're all pieces of a fart?

301
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,944
What if we stopped moving?

302
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:24,989
What is going on here?

303
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,949
We were just trying to order lunch.

304
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,993
But we went too deep on the what-ifs.

305
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,494
We're scared, Boss.

306
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,913
What if ideas were little people?

307
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,416
What if we're someone else's idea?

308
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,918
What if we're a fart's idea?

309
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,211
[all] Whoa!

310
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,963
[growls]

311
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,258
My crack team of thinkers
is paralyzed by their own genius!

312
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:47,678
I need any idea you got
to get this team named Babies.

313
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,055
We could do a stunt where we jump
20 babies on a dirt bike.

314
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,265
[spits]

315
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,060
Full honesty: that's an old Danny idea
I just borrowed.

316
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,854
-That's it!
-A dirt bike baby jump?

317
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,940
No, the human equivalent
of a dirt bike baby jump.

318
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:04,320
When logic has failed, we must turn
to a mind of unpredictable chaos!

319
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:06,822
[Tim] Glad you could make it.

320
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:10,659
I'm glad we're still buds with all this
Baby/Hot Dog tension in the etherhood.

321
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,120
Etherhood? Good term!

322
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,872
Hope you don't mind I brought Midge.

323
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,333
She's been following me
for all my brilliant ideas.

324
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,544
I'm glad she's here because we gotta solve
this team name problem.

325
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,795
Beautiful day for that.

326
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,798
-Shouldn't you have a putter?
-Tim and I play medium golf.

327
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,093
The goal is to get the ball
into the next hole.

328
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:32,431
You're making me look like
an amateur entrepreneur.

329
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,351
So, team name-- how do we decide?

330
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,936
-Any ideas?
-No.

331
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,438
So I'll just blurt one out. Soccer game.

332
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,481
[gasps]

333
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:41,982
Dogs versus Babies.

334
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:45,194
I put together the dog team,
Tim wrangles some babies.

335
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,528
How would that work?

336
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,906
First to five or five fives.

337
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,241
Five-player teams,
winner is the first team

338
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:55,454
to score five goals or whoever is ahead
after five five-minute quarters.

339
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,458
It's insane, but perfectly logical,
