-No problema, compañero.

25
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:39,849
But you did promise me a day of filmgoing,
so let's just sneak into another one.

26
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:43,770
What? That's like stealing a movie.
I have to go to church on Sunday!

Bro... [slurps]

28
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,274
movie theaters are buffets for the eyes.

29
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:52,654
Your parents paid good, adult cash
for the pleasure of us enjoying a movie.

30
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,364
Doesn't matter which one.

31
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:55,990
That sounds justifiable.

32
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,534
What should we see?

33
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,369
Pyg and Tam Stick It to the Man?

34
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,454
I hear they're back and badder than ever.

35
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,249
No. This.

36
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:07,043
Whispers of the Dawn, Heretofore.

37
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,295
This is the one. We gotta see it!

38
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,714
-Looks boring.
-I doubt that very much.

39
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,007
It's for adults!

40
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:16,219
So are cholesterol and changing
out of your PJs on Saturday.

41
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:21,141
This is grown-up cinema,
a world of forbidden mystery.

42
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,059
I do like owls. [grunts]

43
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,520
-[laughing]
-What? So funny!

44
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,982
Of course our parents
are the worst offenders.

45
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,776
What is so important
you can't give 74 quiet minutes

46
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,778
to a ducky in backwoods peril?

47
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,739
We should name pavlova
the official town cake!

48
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:40,535
Phenomenal idea, Janice!
I'll just jot it down in the book.

49
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,997
I keep all my ideas
in this little three-ring pocket folio.

50
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,040
I call it my "ideas book."

51
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:49,002
You like great ideas for the town, Quincy?
Check this out.

52
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:52,714
When you're on a quick errand,
parking meters should take pennies.

53
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,215
Wow! Going in the book.

54
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,218
-[Janice] This is amazing!
-Oh, Mother, Father.

55
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,553
Cake and pennies?

56
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,763
Those are the ideas you push
when you have the ear

57
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,225
of the most powerful
political figure in town-- Oh-ho-ho!

58
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,311
-Your dad's the mayor.
-Yeah.

59
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,229
-And my parents know him!
-Yeah.

60
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,940
-And you and I are friends!
-Uh, yeah.

61
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,359
Why did I never see this before?

62
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,944
Business and politics,

63
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,739
the world's most productive
and corruptible relationship!

64
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,657
We have to take advantage of this!

65
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,868
Sky's the limit here, people.

66
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,246
We're gonna boost baby love
all the way to Yellow 100.

67
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,875
All we've got to do is fill
the mayor's idea book with our ideas,

68
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,419
like stroller lanes on city streets.

69
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,213
Changing tables in all public bathrooms.

70
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,215
Baby Day baby parade!

71
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,092
A baby royal wedding.

72
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,304
Tiny queen, infant prince,
the adoration of millions

73
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,140
who cling to medieval notions
of bloodline nobility!

74
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,852
So... we make two babies marry each other?

75
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,479
Not my best idea. What do you want?

76
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,440
I worked through naptime
because I'm too excited! Whoo!

77
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:53,733
[knock on door]

78
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,109
Help yourselves, children.

79
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,861
My toy days have ceased.

[door closes]

81
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,037
How much of this am I supposed to use?

82
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,956
Like, one can per face?

83
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,666
You have no facial hair.

84
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,709
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

85
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,628
You're still so young. [grunts]

86
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,964
That's not a screw top, by the way.

87
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,344
Fine. I'll ask Mom and Dad.

88
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,431
Couch reading-- so adult.

89
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,891
I've come to the right people.

90
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,393
Ted, Janice.

91
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,355
Oh, um... hello... son.

92
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,526
I'm about to tell you something big,
so, please, sit down.

93
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,988
[inhales, exhales]

94
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,073
Danny and I snuck into...

95
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,034
a grown-up movie.

96
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,955
That's a broad category, Timbo.

97
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,498
What exactly did you see?

98
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,624
I saw a man.

99
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,042
Still pretty broad.

100
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,127
And an owl.

101
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,087
Oh! [chuckles]

102
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,257
That new-- [stammers] The art film,
with that good actor.

103
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,303
You know who I'm talking about, Ted.
He wins awards because he's sad.

104
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,346
Yeah! That one with the owl.

105
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,098
I heard good things. [clears throat]

106
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,809
Doesn't mean that what you did is okay.

107
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:13,062
We're all grown-ups here.
Let's move past that.

108
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,814
-[both] Uh...
-Um...

109
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:18,401
That movie was real confusing
for Tim Templeton, the child I used to be.

110
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,902
But that's where you two come in.

111
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,238
You've been grown up
for as long as I can remember.

112
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,365
I need you to teach me
the ways of adulthood.

113
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:27,452
So you can understand a movie you saw?

114
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,038
I knew we'd be on the same page, Ted.

115
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,081
This is all very, um...

116
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,460
-We're gonna need a second, kiddo.
-Adulto, please.

117
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,503
What do you think?

118
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:41,841
I'm not thrilled he saw the movie,
but he does seem pretty shaken up over it.

119
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,218
Wanna shake him all the way out of it?

120
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,513
I say we do teach him
the ways of adulthood--

121
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,725
a full night of boring grown-up stuff.

122
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,227
Show him how much better it is
just being a kid.

123
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,564
Yeah! But what are we supposed to do
with the baby all night?

124
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:57,940
[gasps]

125
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,569
I just found my doorway
into the halls of power!

126
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,905
We need three-ring pocket folio paper

127
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,741
with our ideas written down
in the mayor's handwriting.

128
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,785
-Put our top forger on it.
-Chip?

129
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,453
Yeah, that'd be Chip.

130
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,538
I'll see you at the mayor's house.

131
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,959
Hello, adult kid-man.

132
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:18,669
Hello, baby brother.

133
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,797
Couldn't help overhearing your plans.

134
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,799
I should really get out of your hair
for the night.

135
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:26,552
Perhaps... oh, my first sleepover
at a chum's house.

136
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,305
-That would be a hoot.
-Why would you say "hoot"?

137
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:30,723
It's a win-win!

138
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:34,102
I'm exhausted anyway.
Worked through naptime. [yawns]

139
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,144
Don't recommend it.

140
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,480
And you adults should be
free to cut loose!

141
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,065
Enjoy diet vegetables,

142
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:42,985
say "guess what," and then follow it up
with a boring fact about a neighbor.

143
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,487
That does sound like what we do.

144
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,074
All right, we will teach you
our grown-up ways.

145
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,034
I'm thrilled.

146
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,994
Thank you, Ted, Janice.

147
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,539
We do have one concern.

148
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:55,998
What do we do with the baby?

149
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,709
Might I suggest an overnight
with one of his baby friends?

150
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,962
That's not a bad idea.

151
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,588
What do you think, big guy?

152
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,924
-Ready for your first overnighter?
-[giggling]

153
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:08,219
Okay! Let's call the Buskies!

-[cooing]

156
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,438
You know, he got along so well
with Joy at the movie,

157
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,690
maybe we should call
Quincy and Pearl instead.

158
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,443
My main amigo, Mayor Quincino?

159
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,237
[gasps] Our baby will be in great hands!

160
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,363
[sighs]

161
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,202
Pearly vines, the Templetons are here!

162
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,204
[chuckles] Hi!

163
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:39,000
I'd invite you inside, but I'm just
in the middle of spring cleaning.

164
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,044
I hear ya. That's what Janice says
when our house is a filthy mess--

165
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,839
So, let me walk you through
our little guy's special stuff.

166
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,175
This is Señor Squeaky.

167
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,177
-Give it to him...
-Sure you're good with this?

168
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,554
Baby love mission in royal digs?

169
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,097
What's not to be good with?

170
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,016
[grunts, groans]

171
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,810
I'm fine. Just that missed naptime.

-All right, big guy, Daddy wuvs you.

173
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,149
-[chuckles] Oh!
-We ready for this?

174
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:06,027
[Pearl] Can I take you inside
to see Joy, sweetheart?

175
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,988
[Janice] Oh, Mommy loves you, too!
Have a great night!

176
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:14,994
[Pearl chuckles]

177
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:18,331
Are those wide eyes and pouty lips
judging our housekeeping?

178
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:21,542
Because I don't have the time or energy
to impress a baby.

179
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,752
[chuckles]

180
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,588
Don't let my Pearly girl tease you,
little man.

181
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:30,343
This is a zero-judgment household,
so you just relax and do you.

182
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,344
[laughs]

183
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,721
We are microwaving supper tonight!

184
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,849
You've been working all day, Pearl.
Let me help you press the buttons.

185
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,101
I just gotta write something down
before I forget it.

186
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,063
We can play in a bit.
I need to take care of something first.

187
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,815
Can you just show me
where "Dada" keeps his idea book

188
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,318
before I get crushed
by a stack of junk mail?

189
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,986
-Here it is.
-Thank you.

190
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,948
And I absolutely do want
to play later, just...

191
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,368
Gah! [grunts]

192
00:08:56,619 --> 00:09:01,916
-[gasping, grunting]
-[coos]

193
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:05,711
Ah, shoot! Pearl, I lost it again!

194
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,755
I don't suppose you babies
have seen my book.

195
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:10,550
Mm, booky, booky.
Book, book, bookedy...

196
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,843
He can't be talking about the book.

197
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,972
You know, the one with all my ideas!

198
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,432
[Pearl] Uh, have you checked
the usual spots?

199
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,686
-I even checked the unusual spots.
-[Pearl chuckles]

200
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,981
-Oh, you!
-I'm such a silly bean, ain't I? [laughs]

201
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:30,236
-Why don't your parents get a maid?
-[babbles]

202
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,406
That's what a mayor makes? Sheesh.

203
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,658
No wonder no one
with a functional business mind

204
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,118
ever runs for office.

205
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,913
Gah! Stay back, laundry monster!

206
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,248
Roar!

207
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,625
-Feed me detergent!
-[gasping]

208
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,920
[chuckles] Just kidding. I'm Jimbo!

209
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,215
You seem on edge, Boss.

210
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,258
I'm fine.

211
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,802
Just not used to being in a strange house.

212
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,388
[munching]

213
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,348
A very strange house.

214
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,850
You got the pages?

215
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,184
Chip?

216
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:05,605
Forged papers
full of baby-friendly policy ideas.

217
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,231
Pew pew, bang bang!

218
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,650
Great, but I got a problem
with the book.

219
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,611
-[Staci] Where is it?
-That's the problem.

220
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,779
How can anyone find anything in this mess?

221
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,198
It's like where a landfill
sends its garbage.

222
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,201
I mean, it's like where a landfill
sends its garbage.

223
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,038
Did I already say it's like
where a landfill sends its garbage,

224
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,373
or did I just think it? [chuckles]

225
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,542
Maybe I shouldn't have worked
through naptime.

226
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,502
It's like where a landfill
sends its garbage.

227
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,004
Did I just say it again?

228
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,757
Back to the office,
and keep those pages safe.

229
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,342
Okey-dokie!

230
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,803
I'm gonna get someone
who can help find the book.

231
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,890
You give yourself
a little mental health break, okay?

232
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:41,974
Play with your friend.

233
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,480
[Ted] The beverage of adulthood.

234
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:52,401
If we're gonna talk grown-up stuff,
you need some joe in your veins.

235
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,655
Do I add cream and sugar,
or is that just for movie stars?

236
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,532
That's the training wheels version
of coffee.

237
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:02,953
Adults love the pure, bitter taste
of water steeped through crushed beans

238
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,538
and served burning hot.

239
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,666
Ahh, the best!

240
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,834
Of course, if you don't like it,

241
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,671
maybe it means
you're not ready for adult--

242
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:15,466
Okay, you're--
you're just going for it, I see.

243
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,636
It does taste like being an adult!

244
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,014
I can feel my mustache growing!
Teach me about jazz.

245
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,766
Oh... okay.

246
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,396
-[sniffing]
-Meet my elite hide-and-seekers team.

247
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,774
The elite team is just Frankie?

248
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:35,111
Do not underestimate a baby who's spent
most of her life surviving in a vent

249
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,113
and making friends with garbage.

250
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,906
Ew. Is that really necessary?

251
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,617
No, I just like grape jam.

252
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,911
That's not grape jam.

253
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,581
This isn't a goop taste test.

254
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:51,460
Where's the book?
I want the book! I want the book!

255
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:55,464
Yeah, you definitely should stop
skipping naps.

256
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,549
[Frankie] This is it!

257
00:11:56,757 --> 00:12:01,262
What's that, Mr. Shoe-bert Lace-evedo?
[chuckles]

258
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,179
I get it.

259
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,390
[gasps] What'd the shoe say?

260
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,308
Mostly neighborhood gossip.

261
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,395
You're so wicked, Shoe-bert.

262
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,522
But he's pointing due south.

263
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:12,815
You know what that means.

264
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,192
Shoes can use compasses now?

265
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:20,030
The mayor was heading that way
when he came home with the book.

266
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,871
-[hoots]
-[screams]

267
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,414
-What?
-What do you mean what?

268
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:32,668
-The flying owl!
-Um, that owl?

269
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:38,466
Okay, fine. I'm a little overtired,
so let's get this mission done.

270
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:42,052
[Frankie] Guys, you'll never guess
where I think the book is!

271
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:45,806
Actually, you might guess
if you guess the bathroom.

272
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,266
It's in the bathroom.

273
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:50,394
I do admire a man
who gets his business done

274
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,062
getting his business done.

275
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,147
The papers?

276
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:54,607
Chip?

277
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,400
Howdy do?

278
00:12:58,736 --> 00:12:59,653
What is this?

279
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,531
Yeppers!
Can't even tell the difference, huh?

280
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,825
You just typed everything!

281
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,160
I did not!

282
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:10,164
I hand forged every letter to be
an exact duplicate of this document

283
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,582
from the mayor's office.

284
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,292
That's a typewritten document!

285
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,504
Oh! Jeez, I just thought he had
really neat handwriting.

286
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,838
He is a mayor.

287
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,423
[yells]

288
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,842
Actual mayor's handwriting.

289
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:26,889
I want new pages made before
the shadow owl returns for my blood.

290
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,517
Uh, yes, sir.

291
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,479
Jimbo and I can take the book in
and return it

292
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,356
with the pages already forged...

293
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,816
you know, if you wanted
to get some shut-eye.

294
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,443
Oh, bless you, Stace.

295
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,570
-Call me when--
-[coos]

296
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:43,822
[Mayor] You found my book!

297
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:47,034
From now on, I'm not letting
this thing out of my sight.

298
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,163
[grunts] There goes my chance
at a quick nap!

299
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,207
You get those forgeries back to me.

300
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,960
But hurry. My enemy senses weakness.

301
00:13:57,044 --> 00:14:00,756
[Janice] Behold!
The toys of the adult world.

302
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,678
At work, we get to play
with these fun paperclips all day long,

303
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,055
during the handful of ten-minute breaks
allotted to us.

304
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:11,183
It's a club! Or a knight's mace!

305
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,310
Foul file folder dragon!

306
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,853
-[grunting]
-[growling]

307
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:18,440
I am far more enjoyable
than a kid's Football Mike toy!

308
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,110
I thought my grown-up dream
was to work in an office,

309
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,487
but now I feel I might find that childish.

310
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,614
Yeah.

311
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:29,952
You know, maybe it is better
just to stay a kid a while longer,

312
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,330
where the world is still
full of exciting possibilities.

313
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:36,625
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be a marine biologist.

314
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,170
I was going to be
an air traffic controller.

315
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,882
"Two-one-zero-five
Compton-three-foxtrot departure,

316
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,341
you are cleared for takeoff."

317
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,843
Zoom! [chuckles]

318
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:46,927
[Tim] Fascinating.

319
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,638
So, when did you decide
to give up on your dreams?

320
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,723
[both] Uh...

321
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,183
Brupper!

322
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:57,730
-Breakfast for supper! Mwah!
-You have outdone yourself, my love.

323
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,857
There we go. Down in the crack.

324
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,359
Lose the book, lose the book!

325
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,153
[chuckles]

326
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,322
You old butterfingers!

327
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,116
Ooh! [chuckles] Guilty!

328
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,785
Maybe I should snuggle with it
when I sleep.

329
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,829
-No, no, no!
-[Mayor] Can't lose it then.

330
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,873
[Pearl] Hey, it works with me.

331
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:19,877
-[grunts] No! No! No!
-[Mayor and Pearl laughing]

332
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,880
[groans, snores]

333
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:26,467
[Mayor] Your friend is missing
the "Night-Night to Everything Song," Joy.

334
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,928
Don't you stress, baby boy.

335
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:32,640
-This tune will put you right to sleep.
-Where were we, now?

336
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:36,226
