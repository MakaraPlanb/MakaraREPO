Does he have a fever?

Ninety-eight point...

What? Why are we involving
Dr. Kevin in this?

00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,685
He wants all the information
we can give him, anything unusual.

You just act like we're not even here.

Are you sure you don't want me
to take a turn watching him?

What if you stare so long,
your eyeballs dry out,

and shrink into eyeball raisins,
and fall out of your head?

Do you think his voice is growing so fast

No, no, that's ridiculous!

-Tell us what's wrong, baby!
-He's probably just tired.

00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,877
Like a perfectly normal baby.

60
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,171
And he can't sleep
because his parents keep staring at him

61
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,131
and scribbling notes
about everything he does.

62
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:56,175
Oh, my gosh.
Of course, the baby senses our anxiety.

63
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,219
I feel so much guilt and terror right now.

64
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,638
You guys take a break.
I'll put him down for a nap.

65
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,600
Okay, but get us
the minute he falls asleep.

66
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,560
And anything unusual, you let us know

67
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,186
so we can write it down
for the pediatrician.

Everyone was expecting you at the office,

No time to explain.

75
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,663
But you have time to color?

If he gives me
the "healthy baby all clear,"

87
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,989
the specter of irregularity
will dissipate,

88
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,407
and Mom and Dad will feel comfortable

laissez-faire parenting.

of Baby Corp's special formula,

to make one word.

No! It's not like
we're gonna be selling this to the public!

Give me my moment in the sun. Geez!

118
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,942
And it'll last long enough
to keep his parents non-suspicious

119
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,653
until Dr. Kevin can give
the normal baby all clear?

120
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,114
Oh, it'll last forever!

00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,470
[gasps]

174
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,721
-[Jimbo] No!
-No!

175
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,306
Hey! My cubicle!

176
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,767
Bad dogs! Git!
This is Baby Corp territory!

177
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,562
-[gasps]
-[barking]

178
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,065
-What did he say?
-Heck if I know.

179
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,151
Yo! Who speaks dog?

180
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,070
Whatever, I took a semester
in baby college.

181
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,864
And say it again.

182
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,618
[whines, barks]

183
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:18,498
Now it's PuppyCo's time to strike!
Boss Baby is out of commission.

184
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:22,084
Baby Corp is weak and helpless,
with no real leadership!

185
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,127
Ha-ha!

186
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,881
His barks, not mine.

187
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,383
[grumbles, sighs]

188
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,885
All right, then.

189
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,262
[babies clamoring]

190
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,516
Hey, butt sniffers! Go fetch!

191
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,518
[barking]

192
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,109
[Jimbo] Doggy want another fetch-fetch?

193
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,536
-[whimpers]
-[Jimbo giggles]

194
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,372
Just like the boss was here himself.

195
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,878
[cooing]

196
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:06,879
[both giggle]

197
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,422
-Aw, you wanna hug?
-Yeah.

198
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,300
It's kinda cute having
an actual "baby" brother.

199
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,010
Ow! Why would you do that?

200
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,680
[cries]

201
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,140
Tim, what did you do?

202
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,851
What? He's the one who squeezed
my nose really hard!

203
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,646
He never squeezes noses.
I'm writing it down.

204
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,315
Oh, you're okay, little fella.

205
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,734
Did your big brother scare you?

206
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:33,364
Faster, Jimbo! As fast as I whipped
Bug the Pug's stupid puppy tail!

207
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:37,785
-You got it, Temporary Boss!
-Yellow 100!

208
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,914
Pyg and Tam love babies

209
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,666
[groans]

210
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,543
Now you guys?

211
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,795
Jimbo, call maintenance to fix the door

212
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:51,716
and custodial to haul away
the garbage I'm about to throw out.

213
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,469
[hums, groans]

214
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,515
[in British accent]
Bangin' office, luv. Proper cozy, innit?

215
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,183
What you fink, Pyg?

216
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,186
[in high-pitched voice]
Chuffed! Chuffed!

217
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,272
[in normal voice]
Mr. Pyg and Mr. Tam

218
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,356
recently made an exchange--

219
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,400
Wait a minute, hold up.

220
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:12,862
Are we really just not gonna talk
about the accents?

221
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,072
[in British accent]
What? It's rebellious, innit?

222
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,367
[in normal accent]
We felt that tough-as-nails EastEnders

223
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:22,705
was a better fit for Pyg and Tam's
new "bad boy" television presence.

224
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:28,210
Yeah, okay, but you can't just,
like, suddenly be from London!

225
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,296
You're turning TV into a lie!

226
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,757
We're off topic. Mr. Pyg and Mr. Tam

227
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,259
recently made an exchange
with Mr. Bug the Pug,

228
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,595
who suggested today would be
the perfect time

229
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,722
to acquire Baby Corp's office building.

230
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,559
[in British accent]
On accounts of you got no real leadership.

231
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,811
[in normal accent]
The building isn't for sale.

232
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,522
And I got the leadership thing covered.

233
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,234
[laughs]

234
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,903
[in British accent]
You ain't no boss.

235
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,239
As soon as Bug's puppies
done wrecking the place,

236
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,576
you'll be begging us to buy it
for pence on the pound.

237
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,370
[in normal accent]
The only pound happening today

238
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:05,748
is the one I'm gonna give you
if you don't skedaddle!

239
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,167
[mutters]

240
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,379
Oh, also, the pound
I'm sending the puppies to.

241
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:14,423
Man, "pound" has a ton
of totally different meanings.

242
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:18,469
Anyway, point is your big, stupid plan's
over before it starts!

243
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,474
[in British accent]
Fing is, likes we said,

244
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:26,560
-Bug and us, we made a deal.
-[phone beeping]

245
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,146
[in normal accent]
You gotta get down here!

246
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,523
Somebody jailbroke the puppies!

247
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:31,774
-[grunts]
-[puppy barks]

248
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:37,071
[in British accent]
And that, luv, was our end of the deal.

249
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,490
[clamoring]

250
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:40,950
[Staci groans]

251
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,035
A double arch-nemesis day?

252
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,579
And you guys--
we gonna have a problem?

253
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,165
Circle back on that one.

254
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,542
Business!

255
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,586
-[glass shatters]
-Okay, preeks are neutral in this fight.

256
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,131
We just need to calm
all our babies down and--

257
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,592
[OCB] You're panicked,
I get it. But fear is a choice, my babies.

258
00:11:58,676 --> 00:11:59,927
You are kidding me.

259
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,387
Know what else has choices?

260
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,640
Vending machines, pop quizzes, elections.

261
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:06,725
New leader? Me?

262
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,103
[chuckles]
Who's to say? You are!

263
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,313
Pow! Now you're fearless!

264
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:15,025
Excellent points! He says
what the politicians are afraid to.

265
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:19,155
-Here, have some literature.
-Multi-Multi-Task Former CEO Baby?

266
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,866
You work for the consulting baby now?

267
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,494
-How could you?
-I need constant excitement!

268
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,704
Thumb wrestle me!

269
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:30,458
Hey! Don't listen
to this three-dimpled catalog cover.

270
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,377
OCB is just gunning for Boss Baby's job!

271
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,587
Boss Baby?

272
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,257
Mr. Abandon-his-workers?
Chief exiting officer?

273
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,551
He left instructions!

274
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:44,847
-How are you even here?
-Got a call from that guy.

275
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,765
I thought we needed the help!

276
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,560
You know, because of our lack
of real leadership.

277
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,437
[groans]

278
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,024
Hot temper.
This company needs something cooler.

279
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,068
[upbeat music]

280
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,237
Ha!

281
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,948
Yeah! Who else is feeling this?

282
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,575
-[babies cheering]
-Leadership dance-off!

283
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,952
That is not how leadership works!

284
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,497
Look! It's the guy on the flyer!

285
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,042
-Yay! I'll cheer for whatever!
-[cheering]

286
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,921

[panting, grunting]

289
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,893
-Everybody, follow--
-Follow me!

290
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,729
Okay, but only because you said it louder!

291
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,773
-[baby 2] Help!
-[groans]

292
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,234
Triple arch-nemesis day!

293
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,319
How is this fair?
[gasps]

294
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,821
[growling]

295
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,452
Vive la résistance!

[grunts]

297
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:56,544
I saved as many as I could,
but it is dangerous out there.

298
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,505
What do we do,
temporary acting fill-in boss?

299
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,049
[somber music]

300
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:07,179
[groans]
We bring back Boss Baby.s

301
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:12,351
Whoa, there. Isn't it way early
for him to take the Unstafant formula?

302
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,228
He'll fail his doctor test!

303
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:17,398
And Baby Corp's gonna fail
if he doesn't come back now.

304
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,567
Yo, Tim, change of plans!

305
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,485
Tim?

306
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,571
Go!

307
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:32,079
-Jimbo!
-I don't like people feeling left out.

308
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,874
-Come on!
-Where are we going?

309
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,750
Boss is gonna come back with a plan.

310
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:40,212
And whatever it is,
he's gonna need an army.

311
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:43,841
[laughs]

312
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,010
We've done this a thousand times.

313
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,678
Did we miss any warning signs?

314
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,598
Oh, we should never
have taken him to France!

315
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,601
-What does that have to do with--
-I don't know, I'm just scared!

316
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,479
Hi, Baby Boss!

317
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:01,734
Staci needs you back to big Boss
or Baby Corp's gonna go bye-bye.

318

-[muffled squealing]
-Shh!

319
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,155
-He's so cute!
-Sure.

320
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,533
Why are we messing with the plan?
We're just leaving for Dr. Kevin's.

321
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,578
I have to get him through his checkup,
then I have to give him the...

322
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,706
Where's the Unstafant formula?

323
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,627
I found it! And your missing monitor, too!

324
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,421
Who is that? And why
is she kicking a badminton birdie?

325
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:25,132
I'll get the stuff back
and meet you at the doctor's office.

326
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:28,177
Just get Boss through that checkup
as fast as you can!

327
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,097

329
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,480
Yes! Increase that degree of difficulty!

330
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,273
Make me feel alive-- Oh!

Hey!

336
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,132
I misspelled our last name again!
I'm just so nervous!

337
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,760
Can we be the Templetans for today?

338
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:10,970
No.

339
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:15,057
Here, I'll do it.
Yes, no, yes, no, yes, no, done!
