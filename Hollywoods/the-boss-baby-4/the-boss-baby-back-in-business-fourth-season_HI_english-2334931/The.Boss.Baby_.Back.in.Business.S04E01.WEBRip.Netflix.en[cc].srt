Ugh! Baby Corp

during that half hour
when the triplets were CEOs.

157
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,401
We were mad with power.

158

You're in charge.
Why don't you kick the puppies out?

I wish I could, but the triplets wrote
an airtight rental lease.

And those puppy lawyers-- woof!

167
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,718

169
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,555
I need to do it ASAP.

00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,655
Like you said, I'm in charge now.
The CEO!

176
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,367
I can give 100 percent at the office
and 100 percent at home.

177
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,661
-Not how math works.
-Executive math.

178
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,372
It's not my job to do everything myself.

179
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:22,210
I provide the vision so others can step up
and do their best work.

180
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,586
[mic feedback rings]

181
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,922
Hello, you beautiful Baby Corp!

182
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:29,300
-Yellow 100!
-[babies] Yellow 100!

183
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,511
There's my superstar employees!

184
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:35,181
You're killing it out there, team,
and I'm proud of every one of you.

185
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,266
I feel so empowered!

186
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:41,729
He makes me want to be less terrible
as an employee and a person!

187
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:46,067
Now let's put that collective
Baby Corp brainpower to a new task:

188
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,277
-our renter problem.
-[growling]

189
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,989
No bad ideas.
Pitch and go, make your magic.

190
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,741
I'll be offline for the next hour,

191
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:57,620
and I believe with a little imagination
and 100 percent effort,

192
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,581
this place could be puppy-free
by the time I come back.

193
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:04,835
-[chimes]
-[babies cheering]

194
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:09,423
Uh... so, you want us to put a pause
on baby love missions?

195
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,260
Nope! I want 100 percent effort
on that, too.

196
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,054
-Executive math.
-[all] Oh!

197
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,931
Oh! I get it.

198
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,641
Total faith in everybody. Go get 'em!

199
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,185
-Yellow 100!
-[babies] Yellow 100!

200
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,937
[all cheering]

201
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:24,939
Hold the fort, Stace.

202
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:28,442
Templeton, let's see
this Safety Showcase spectacular.

203
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,280
-As a Do-Good Trooper...
-I will do good for safety...

204
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,990
By taking every opportunity...

205
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,742
To prepare others
for any danger or crisis.

206
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,245
[cooing]

207
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,124
Safety scenario one: itchy, ouch!

208
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,584
I walked in poison ivy.

209
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:48,546
Apply this rubbing alcohol to your skin
to help remove urushiol oil,

210
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,256
the allergen found in poison ivy!

211
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,884
Oh, my gosh, he's so adorable
and authoritative.

212
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,178
Safety scenario two:
glug, glug, glug, glug!

213
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,723
Uh-oh! Poison!

214
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,309
Safety scenario 49:

215
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:03,603
I am on fire.

216
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,398
Drop and let me roll you in this blanket
to smother the flames.

217
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,692
I have been extinguished.

218
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,194
-Safety scenario 107...
-[groans]

219
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,739
...I'm not sure
if my smoke alarms are working.

220
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,866
You should have smoke alarms
in every bedroom,

221
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,869
outside each sleeping area,
and on every level of your house.

222
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,288
My house has seven smoke alarms,

223
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,207
and I'm going to show you
how to test them all right now.

224
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,792
-Oh, honey, no!
-[alarm beeping]

225
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,461
[all screaming]

00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,718
[screaming continues]

229
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,554
Any chance you can slip
out of there real quick?

230
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,599
Had a little hiccup
with the puppy purging at the office.

231
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:42,933
[sighs] You know I'd love to,

232
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,019
but I have to finish giving family
100 percent

233
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,438
before I can give work
another 100 percent.

234
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,982
I'll hit the office as soon as I can.
[crying]

235
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,068
-[man 1] Make it stop!
-[man 2] Make it stop!

236
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,070

-[crying]
-[shivers]

238
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:00,993
I know, buddy, that was
a very, very long-- and informative--

239
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,037
very long safety showcase.

240
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,955
Let's get you home for a nap.

241
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,417
Where's Tim?

242
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,586
He wanted to walk home with Petrosky.

243
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,340
You were amazing!
That part about insect bites?

244
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,925
Man, that was just muscle memory.

245
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,594
Got in a fistfight with a fire anthill
a couple months back.

246
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:19,720
But you, bro...

247
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,514
The overturned canoe rescue?

248
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,891
Yes! That was so intense!

249
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,060
I could see the canoe in my head,
and I'm thinking,

250
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,396
"It is my sacred creed
as a Do-Good Trooper

251
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,523
-to educate these people, so..."

253

[baby crying]

254
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:34,860
Check for hazards!

255
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,657
No broken glass, spilled fuel,
downed power lines,

256
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,201
or unmarked bottles of household poison.

257
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,453
I'll search for adult assistance!

258
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,579
I'll get the baby.

259
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,832
[crying continues]

260
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,918
-Frankie?
-[crying stops]

261
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,878
Oh. Hey, Boss Baby's brother.

262
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,255
Why the heck were you in there?

263
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:58,050
I was trying to install
a new baby smell air freshener,

264
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,595
and then a tree falls on the car,
makes a really loud noise,

265
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,640
and, whoops,
there go the baby tears! [shudders]

266
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,894
I feel like that answer covered everything
except my question.

267
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,522
-Why were you--
-Yellow 100, man!

268
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,567
Gotta boost that baby love 24-7.

269
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,944
-Now let me go so I can--
-[man] Oh, my goodness!

270
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,487
There was a trapped baby!

271
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,615
-These boys are heroes!
-Amazing!

272
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:22,992
[adults shouting]

273
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,327
And now you two just swoop in

274
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,664
and steal all the love
for yourself instead.

275
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,208
Where's your Yellow 100 spirit?

276
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,711
We weren't trying to steal
any love from anybody!

277
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,463
[woman] I wish they were my sons!

278
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:36,839
[elevator bell dings]

279
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,467
Spin me up to speed on the puppy problem.

280
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:43,554
Peg had an idea to raise the rent so high,
PuppyCo couldn't cover it.

281
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,014
-Love it!
-[barking]

282
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:46,807
Why are they still here?

283
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:51,896
Well, the puppies decided to cover costs
by renting some of their space

284
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,647
to another company.

285
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:54,815
What? Who?

286
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,275
Business!

287
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:59,320
Business! Business! Business!

288
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,113
Four hundred dollars!

289
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,281
I'm crazy, crazy!

290
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:05,117
I don't know what I'm doing
because I fell in love!

291
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,285
[preeks shouting]

292
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,329
[girl] Business! Business!

293
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,956
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

294
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,126
Preeks?
How did you even get them out--

295
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,504
They're not even a business!

296
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,924
Do any of you actually produce or provide
any goods and/or services?

297
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,426
We have to move the needle.

298
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,595
What does that even mean?

299
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:28,807
Um... but if a needle-le is--

300
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:29,975
is b...

301
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,687
oh, I think, um, if a needle is...

302
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,022
I don't know.

303
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,774
'Cause just balloons.

00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,400

306
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,197
-There's no way this is legal.
-[barks]

307
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,868
No, I do not want to confer
with your puppy lawyer!

308
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:51,247
[Chip] Oh, good, you're back!
I need another signature.

309
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,707
-Need a minute, Chip!
-[babies shouting]

310
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,126
I need you to write it down right here!

311
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,254
-Don't make me forge this!
-Sir! Sir!

312
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,965
[babies shouting]

313
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:05,761
Boss Baby, I had a situation
on a Yellow 100 mission,

314
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,805
and I need to know our response action.

315
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:08,931
Hang on, everyone.

316
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,851
Board Baby Emiliano wants a status update
on evicting the renters!

317
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,562
Tell him we're brainstorming solutions.

318
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,147
-[monitor chiming]
-Yo, Boss, it's your brother!

319
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,816
Sounds important.

320
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,569
-[Chip] Just one signature!
-[Peg] I need your attention!

321
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,280
Templeton, what's going on?

322
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,657
I'm getting a medal... from the mayor!

323
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,785
That's amazing!
Tell me all about it when I get back home.

324
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,370
But you have to come back now.

325
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,664
They want to do the award ceremony
in time for the news,

326
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,249
and the whole family's invited.

327
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,751
[groans] I just did a family thing.

328
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,794
Jeez...

329
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,297
I just thought you'd want to know.

330
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,049
I'm sorry. Of course I did.

331
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,634
You just caught me at a busy time.

332
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,304
-I'll cover for you with Mom and Dad.
-No!

333
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,931
100 percent, job and family!
I will be there.

334
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,099
Give me three minutes.

335
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,227
[babies shouting]

336
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,774
Quiet!

337
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,693
Open-office floor plan!

338
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:03,611
Sir?

339
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,989
That's how you get rid of the renters--
take down all the cubicle walls.

340
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,199
No privacy, no separation.

341
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,369
Everybody will drive each other crazy,
the puppies and preeks will bail,

342
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,747
and you babies will outlast them all.

343
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,041
They'll be driving us crazy, too.

344
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,001
How are we supposed to outlast them?

345
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,753
Because of this!

346
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,755
You're Baby Corp.

347
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,840
You don't need me
to answer every little question.

348
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,508
You've already got my vision.

349
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,428
So get out there, get down and dirty,

350
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:33,390
and do whatever it takes to fill
that heart with 100 percent baby love.

351
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,017
Yellow 100!

352
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,311
[babies] Yellow 100!

353
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,272
Down and dirty, whatever it takes.

354
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,608
I got you, Boss Baby.

355
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,194
All right, babies, tear them down!

356
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,279
[babies shouting]

357
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,328
The Thomas R. Kulkelka Medal of Courage.

358
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:57,122
This town awards no higher honor,

359
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:02,503
and I can think of no act more deserving
than rescuing a tiny, helpless baby.

360
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,004
That's my son!

361
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:07,466
The good one, not the one picking his nose
and wiping it under his chair.

362
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,760
Boys, that was some quick thinking.

363
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,471
How did you know all the right things
to do in that scenario?

364
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,515
Mr. Mayor, I'm glad you asked.

365
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:17,518
Because we live by a sacred creed.

366
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,145
-Oh, please don't, sweetie.
-No, no, no-- oh, no.

367
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,647
[Tim] As a Do-Good Trooper...

368
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,234
I will do good for safety
by taking every opportunity...

369
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,112
To prepare others
for any danger or crisis.

370
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,446
Roll that news camera!

371
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:32,825
This town's about to get safety educated.

372
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,369
Uh... s-so, I just... [stammers]

373
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,371
I-I wait till you're done, then?

374
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:40,541
Safety scenario one: itchy, ouch!

375
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,209
I walked in poison ivy.

376
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:46,088
Apply this rubbing alcohol to your skin
to help remove urushiol oil,

377
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,923
the allergen found in poison ivy.

378
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,217
-Safety scenario two: glug...
-[monitor chimes]

379
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,135
What's the problem?

380
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,721
Well, your open office plan is working.

381
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,931
Everyone is driving everyone else crazy.

382
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,476
-We like to pretend we're in a forest...
-[growling, whimpering]

383
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,396
and we're saving horses.

384
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:05,858
-[puppies snarling]
-[babies shouting]

385
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,402
-[Peg] Stop it!
-Don't let him get away!

386
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,779
-[Chip] I'm allergic...
-[puppies barking]

387
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,198
I'm thinking if our babies stay strong,

388
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,702
those puppies and preeks will be
out of here in 20 minutes, tops.

389
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,162
Great! What's the problem?

390
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,414
Our babies aren't staying strong.

391
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,750
Beebs, I am a patient baby,

392
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,502
-but I am losing my mind with this!
-[soft thudding]

393
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,797
-How many tentacles does...
-[snot squishes]

394
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,759
...does you make, um, a octopus laugh?

395
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,470
-I don't know! How many?
-"Ten tickles."

396
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,346
[laughing]

397
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,640
[bellows]

398
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:43,353
Hendershot, you are going to outlast
those pre-kindergartners and puppies

399
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,397
because I believe in you.

400
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,482
Yellow 100.

401
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,734
Yellow 100.

402
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,110
[sighs]

403
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,112
Yellow 100.

404
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,865
Hendershot's not the only baby
falling apart, Boss.

405
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,367
We need you here!
How soon can you get back?

406
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,704
[Tim] As an apex predator,
sharks only respond to power...

407
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,415
[groans] I don't know.
Could be several more...

408
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,794
[Tim] Safety scenario six...

409
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,253
-I'll call you back.
-[Staci] What?

410
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,505
-No! We--
-[monitor turns off]

411
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,840
[Danny] The bowling knot
forms a non-slipping loop

412
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,218
that is ideal for rescue lifting.

413
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,595
-Frankie?
-Hey, Boss. You wanna help?

414
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:17,763
What are you doing?

415
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,641
-Scrubbing lard on the floor.
-Why would you--

416
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:24,561
So that when everybody stands to applaud,
they'll be all slip, crash!

417
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,188
"Grr, we're angry!"

418
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,066
Everybody except the two big kids
up front, of course.

419
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,735
Gotta leave them standing
or the plan doesn't work.

420
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,780
I feel like that answer covered everything
except my question.

421
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:35,697
Why would you--

422
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:39,243
Because they stole love
that rightfully belongs to babies,

423
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:43,122
and you said to get down and dirty
and do whatever it takes,

424
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,666
so I'm gonna frame them
for this whole disaster.

425
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,251
What? You can't!

426
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,044
Kind of already did.

427
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,213
[Boss gasps] Good lard!

428
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,881
But that's my brother!

429
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:53,966
[laughs]

430
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:58,095
Yeah, and he'll never
steal love from us again.

431
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,264
This is on the TV news!

432
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,809
The whole town's gonna hate him forever!

433
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,103
What? No! This is a terrible idea!

434
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,771
[laughs] I get it.

435
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:08,981
Confidence test.

436
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:13,610
Don't worry, you've fully inspired me
to believe in myself and my plan.

437
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,362
Whoo, Yellow 100!

438
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,738
No, that's not-- Whoa!

439
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,158
-[Boss] Ooh!
-I see no safety hazards.

440
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,577
Then it should be safe
to rescue this baby trapped--

441
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,372
Uh, what a fine segue
into handing over these medals!

442
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:29,585
[chuckles] All right, get ready to rise
and applaud some bravery, everyone!

443
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:33,380
Yes! I've always wanted a standing "O"
that wasn't sarcastic!

444
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,591
-[floor squeaking]
-[gasps] No, no, no!

445
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,886
[Mayor] In the valorous spirit
of Thomas R. Kulkelka,

446
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:43,307
it is my extreme pleasure
to present this Medal of Courage

447
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,475
to these deserving young men.

448
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,393
Staci!

449
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:49,605
Everything's okay, sir. It worked!

450
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:53,400
PuppyCo's ready to bail from the office,
and the preeks go with them!

451
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,693
Everything's not okay.

452
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,195
Tell Bug I'll make a deal.

453
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,698
We don't have to make a deal.
They're already leaving.

454
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,408
[barking]

455
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:05,037
My offer is this: we'll put the cubicle
walls back up and leave them there.

456
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,371
You can stay at Baby Corp.

457
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,291
-What?
-Boss! I got Board Baby Emiliano!

458
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,794
[panting] He wants to know what the heck
is going on with the renters.

459
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:16,006
Sir, Yellow 100!

460
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,759
[kazoos playing]

461
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,928
-[fanfare ends]
-[scattered applause]

462
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:27,100
Offer stands, Bug, but in return,
I need a pack of puppies at this museum

463
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,436
in the next 15 seconds,
no questions asked.

464
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,604
[snarling]

465
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:33,190
And I'm gonna need something
from the two of you.

466
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:37,986
Now let's all rise and clap heartily
for our young heroes,

467
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,781
Danny Petrosky and Tim Templeton!

468
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,824
-[all cheering]
-Yeah! That's my boy!

00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,035

[all grunting]

473
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,587
Whoaaa!

474
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,381
[wailing, groans]

475
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,591
What in-- [yelps]

476
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,718
[Mayor] I landed on a medal pin!

477
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:05,806
Does anybody know how to treat
a high ankle sprain and mild bruising?

478
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,766
As a matter of fact, we do.

479
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,101
[squishing]

480
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,769
-Ew!
-Lard?

481
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:11,770
[gasps]

482
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,564
Somebody's in a world of trouble
right now!

483
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,734
Who is responsible
for this unconscionable prankery?

484
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,987
Uh...

485
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,904
[chupie zaps]

486
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,324
Sir, what are you doing to our Yellow 100?

487
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,784
-Today...
-[puppies barking]

488
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,828
...settling for Yellow 50-50.

489

-[grunts]

00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,211
[people groaning]

492
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,381
Those puppies gorged on chicken wings
and spread greasy residue

493
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,966
all over the museum floor!

494
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,510
-It's the only plausible explanation!
-[whimpers]

495
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,721
[man] Why, you stinking puppies!

496
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,222
-I hate puppies!
-Ew!

497
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,224
-Darn puppies!
-I am angry!

498
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,268
-Puppies!
-[people shouting]

499
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,436
[growling]

500
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:59,318
Board's not gonna be happy
about our renters going long-term.

501
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,694
Family emergency.

502
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,154
And the board will get over it,

503
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:05,699
especially after we caused
that massive dip in puppy love.

504
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,785
[barking, snarling]

505
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,163
Oh, knock it off. You get to stay!

506
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,290
And I did say "no questions asked."

507
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:14,333
[snarls]

508
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,378
-Ugh, lard!
-Yeah, sorry about that.

509
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,881
Never apologize for taking the initiative.

510
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,841
And it was a good lesson for me.

511
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:26,094
Maybe you can't give 100 percent
to all things all the time.

512
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:27,429
-You said it.
-True.

513
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,014
So wise.

514
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:31,558
But if you don't,

515
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,644
other people might botch things up
while you're not there.

516
