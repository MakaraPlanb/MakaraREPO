00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,132
Oof, which I also currently have.

176
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:49,760
Free advice: do not neglect
a diaper change for two-plus hours.

177
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,513
I... don't think that advice
applies to me.

178
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:56,809
Any two Pyg and Tam beach towels
for only five bucks!

179
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,269
Mix and match!

180
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,980
There's no way
Maria-Maria picked me at random.

181
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,107
-That was a setup.
-For what?

182
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,027
They're clearly after Baby Corp's share
of the love market.

183
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,112
Embarrassing me was the warning shot.

184
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,406
So what are they firing at us next?

185
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:15,203
Uppies, Templeton.
I wanna look my adversary in the eye.

186
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:18,164
Wonderful job on the show today!

187
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:21,751
Pyg and Tam would love
to say "thank you" in person.

188
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,002
Sounds awesome!

189
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,754
Is it all right with your parents?

190
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,839
[Mom] I love Pyg and Tam!

191
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,382
I think they're good.

192
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:32,303
[Tam slurping]

193
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,305
[gulps]

194
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:35,973
[bleats]

195
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,602
Um, fun show!

196
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,229
-Really good job.
-Thank you.

197
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:44,148
Mr. Pyg and Mr. Tam are honored
by your presence.

198
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:47,151
Also, we know the baby can talk
and runs a secret corporation.

199
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,570
Great, we don't have to pretend anymore,

200
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,198
so why don't you drop
the phony translation act,

201
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:55,910
pack up these poor, dumb circus animals
you're exploiting for TV ratings,

202
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,871
and clear out of town
before this gets messy?

203
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,040
You have me all wrong, Boss Baby.

204
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:04,794
I am Pyg and Tam's communications liaison,
their lawyer, their agent,

205
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,297
and sometimes I suck the helium
out of balloons for their amusement.

206
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,177
[high-pitched voice] But I would never
exploit them.

207
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,013
-[bleats]
-"Laughing! Laughing!"

208
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,432
"Ha, ha, ha."

209
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:23,521
"Make sure they understand my voice
is actually one of gravity and import."

210
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:24,814
Of course, Mr. Tam.

211
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,232
[clears throat, coughs]

212
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,569
[normal voice]
"Now, shall we do business?"

213
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,780
The anteater's in charge?

214
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,115
[laughs]

215
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,741
That's hilarious!

216
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,372
That was insensitive.
I'm sure you're great.

217
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,708
"I am in charge.

218
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,418
But I'm a tamandua.

219
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:48,546
-Anteaters are hillbillies."
-Noted.

220
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,006
But my warning stands.

221
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,924
I don't know how you found out
about Baby Corp.

222
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,385
"We share a mutual acquaintance.

223
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,554
A Mr. The Pug?"

224
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,931
Well, thank you, Bug.

225
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,058
But my warning still stands.

226
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,394
You come after our love, be ready to--

227
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:07,481
"No. We have no interest
in stealing love from babies."

228
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,358
[gasps] They wanna steal babies!

229
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,152
"What?"
[high-pitched voice] "What?"

230
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,030
No? Sorry, just guessing.
Please continue.

231
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,117
[normal voice] "People's love for babies
is the pumping heart

232
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,161
of our television program.

233
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:23,039
We are not your competition.

234
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,499
We hope only to be your--"

235
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,001
[high-pitched voice] "Friends!"

236
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,713
Well, that changes everything.

237
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,092
[normal voice] "This is such a thrill.

238
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:38,888
We are all huge fans
of your Baby Corp work, BB."

239
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,056
I'm so flattered.

240
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,224
"Is it okay that I call you BB?"

241
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:43,976
BB my guest. [chuckles]

242
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,395
-[bleats]
-"Laughing! Laughing!"

243
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,440
"Ha, ha, ha, ha!"

244
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:53,152
We really must be going.
So many fan letters to answer.

245
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,904
-You know how it is.
-Of course.

246
00:10:55,112 --> 00:11:00,451
But Mr. Pyg and Mr. Tam hope we can make
these get-togethers a regular event.

247
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,744
Sounds lovely!

248
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,121
CEO socializing makes the world go round.

249
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,625
-There's our guys!
-Hobnobbing with the big stars!

250
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,960
-Can we take a picture?
-Of course!

251
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,046
Everyone, gather round!

252
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,173
Say "Pyg and Tam!"

253
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,717
-[all] Pyg and Tam!
-[camera shutter clicks]

254
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:20,346
And you guys talked through your issues,
and nobody tried to assassinate anybody,

255
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,264
and now we're friends with TV stars!

256
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,642
I can't believe how great
everything worked out!

257
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:27,603
-Staci, prepare the field team for war.
-Finally!

258
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,605
Wait, what? War? Why?

259
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,607
Templeton, did you not hear
anything in there?

260
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,651
They just declared war,
and I accepted.

261
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,611
No, they didn't. And, no, you didn't!

262
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:38,114
You guys were all smiles
and decided to hang out and stuff.

263
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,990
[chuckles] CEO speak.

264
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,034
Executives never say what they mean.

265
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,621
"We're giving you a title promotion"
equals "You don't get a raise."

266
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:49,041
"Workforce imbalance correction"
equals mass firings.

267
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,460
"Let's make these get-togethers
a regular event" equals...

268
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,171
[grunting, choking]

269
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,923
[gasps] We can't let them do that!

270
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,383
And we won't.

271
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,468
This is what we train for, babies!

272
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,178
Light a fire in your guts

273
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:04,807
and let it burn till our enemies smolder
in the shame of surrender!

274
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,519
-Baby Corp is going to war!
-[cheering]

275
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,772
[Emiliano] I cannot sign off
on these war plans.

276
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,233
Sir, I assure you
they're strategically sound.

277
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,277
I'm sure they're very good.

278
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,654
It's the war itself I cannot approve.

279
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,823
Mr. Chairman, wh-why not?

280
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,408
Le lait de la maison.

281
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,536
Would monsieur care to open up
the flavor with a knock-knock?

282
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,163
Thank you, Dondre.

283
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:33,085
[crying]

284
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,337
Exquisite.

285
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,007
War is a nasty business, Boss Baby.

286
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:43,387
It's not for me to say "why not?"
but for you to prove "why should we?"

287
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,389
They-- The blip! Baby love!

288
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,348
You saw the blip!

289
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,185
You want to go to war over a blip?

290
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,604
Do we even know
that Pyg and Tam caused it?

291
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,982
Well, not know-know,
but I just... know, you know?

292
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,275
They're planning something.

293
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,820
And if our love is attacked,
we will fight back and win.

294
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:03,449
But Baby Corp does not start wars.

295
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,075
The answer is no.

296
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,536
[groans]

297
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,956
Look how stressed this war talk makes you.

298
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,709
You haven't even touched
your puffy snacks.

299
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:16,879
Can I give you some advice?
Take up a hobby.

300
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,672
I make yarn puppets.

301
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,467
This one is me
and this one is my twin brother

302
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,135
Board Baby Hermano Menor!

303
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:26,096
"Hola, mi hermano."
"Hola, mi hermano."

304
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,932
"Let us do business together."

305
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,100
Clickety-clickety-click ka-ching!

306
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,019
Clickety-clickety-click ka-ching!

307
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,982
-[fabric tears]
-[all gasping, screaming]

308
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:41,237
And that's how you eviscerate a goat
with a toy block.

309
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,906
-[Boss Baby] Staci--
-I'm not saying we're gonna.

310
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,784
Emiliano says we can't make
the first strike.

311
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,328
[Staci groaning]

312
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:53,082
He thinks I'm stressed and overreacting,
suggested I take up a hobby.

313
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,918
What if your hobby
is ignoring suggestions?

314
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,711
So, you're not going to war?

315
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,088
Well...

316
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,882
Emiliano just said
we couldn't strike first,

317
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,260
so I'm thinking
I actually will take up a hobby.

318
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:08,931
Annoying Pyg and Tam
until they hit us first.

319
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,683
Then we can get away
with whatever we want.

320
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:11,809
-Ooh!
-[toy squeaks]

321
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,436
That's the most little-brother thing
you've ever said.

322
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,525
So glad we could
finally get together like this!

323
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:24,280
"We look forward to a pleasurable match
and a healthy exchange of ideas.

324
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,406
Kingfisher blue club."

325
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,615
Right away, Mr. Tam.

326
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,617
-What do you recommend?
-Putter.

327
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,743
Doi. It's minigolf.

328
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:33,080
I mean for Operation:
Drive These Two Yahoos to War.

329
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,248
Ah, yes.

330
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:38,127
May I recommend a "baby likes
the shiny golf ball" interruption?

331
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,336
Excellent choice.

332
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,421
Jimbo?

333
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:51,765
Ooh! [giggles]

334
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,184
[scoffs] Babies, am I right?

335
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,979
"Return the ball to me, infant."

336
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,899
[blows raspberry]

337
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,109
[grumbles]

338
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:07,239
-Watch out for Tam's club, innocent baby!
-[woman gasps]

339
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,909
-[whimpers]
-[bleats]

340
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,996
-Did you see that?
-[bleats]

341
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,916
Pyg just saved that kid
from a flying club!

342
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,043
They really do love babies!

343
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,630
[babies giggling]

344
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,507
Who do you like in the fifth race,
CEO friend?

345
