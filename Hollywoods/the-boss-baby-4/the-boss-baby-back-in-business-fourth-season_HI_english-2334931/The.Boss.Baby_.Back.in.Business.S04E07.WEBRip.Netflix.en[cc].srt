00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,864
How hard can you slap a counter?

174
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,490
I have always wanted to find out.

175
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:33,661
[smacks] Hand over that return policy
in writing, now!

176
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,914
-Please?
-Okay, I will get that, sir.

177
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,916
[elevator dings]

178
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,838
-Agricultural futures, am I right?
-[people laughing]

179
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,256
[elevator dings]

180
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:46,883
Hey, guy, you the new mailroom guy?

181
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,385
Yes, the mailroom! That's me.

182
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,304
Best way to the top
is to start at the bottom.

183
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,722
-That's what I say.
-'Kay, guy.

184
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,391
Help yourself to donuts
and joe in the breakroom.

185
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,186
[man] Yeah. Yeah.

186
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,480
No, if we're going back and forth a lot...

187
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,815
What do you say, here?
Have we got a deal?

188
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,233
Okay, good. Sold!

189
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,195
[inhales, exhales]

190
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,362
I'm home.

191
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,698
-Here you go, Jones.
-[woman] Whoa, look at the zip...

192
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,575
-Package for Chakrabarti.
-Thanks there, guy.

193
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,827
Yo, Zalinski,
hope this is more than bills!

194
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:15,953
-[Zalinski guffaws]
-Oof!

195
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,789
That Brecklecap-Grunion merger
looks like a dooz!

196
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:22,460
Slip in an exclusivity clause
to net more liquidity for reinvestment.

197
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,420
Geez, guy! You're a firecracker!

198
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,465
Biff Biedermann,
intra/extra office communications.

199
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:45,983
[Boss Baby yelps]

200
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,568
Mail for...

201
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,694
Carlisle?

202
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,989
Don't know who you are
or who rented you that lip toupee,

203
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,324
but this is my turf.

204
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,201
Easy do's it, Carlisle.

205
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,619
I'm just a one-day wonder.

206
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,663
Trying to pump up
my wheeling and dealing muscles

207
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:02,124
in a big-boy office
while Baby Corp has me on sabbatical.

208
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,086
-Tourist?
-CEO, actually.

209
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,213
Oh, ho, ho, look at this guy!

210
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,674
Thinks he wears platinum tinkle-pants!

211
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,592
Grab a donut on the way back to your crib.

212
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,428
If you don't skedaddle,
we got a war on our hands.

213
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,514
[gasps] A war?

214
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,099
-Oh, thank you!
-[grunts]

215
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:21,269
Oh, what's better than conquering
the adult corporate world?

216
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:25,606
Defeating a baby who's already conquered
the adult corporate world! [grunts]

217
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,527
Carlisle, you got yourself
an incognito business baby rival.

218
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,821
Biff Biedermann ain't going nowhere.

219
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,866
Then I'll have to
"nowhere" you myself, guy.

220
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,328
You got the edge.

221
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,622
Now find something in this policy
that doesn't make sense

222
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,040
and shove it in her face.

223
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,794
Aha! Right here,
it says "clothes can't be worn."

224
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:50,214
Is that "worn" like you wore it,
or worn-out, like there's holes in it?

225
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,340
-Pretty unclear.
-[sighs]

226
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:54,218
It means you can't wear the clothes
and bring 'em back,

227
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,012
like your grandma clearly did.

228
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:59,890
Okay, let's treat each other
with a little more respect.

229
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,018
Me and you, we're working women, right?

230
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,436
Actually, I'm working.

231
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,896
You're customer-ing,
and you're kinda bad at it.

232
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,815
Why are you such a brick wall?

233
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:11,485
We're on the same side in this fight
for worker and customer fairness!

234
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,280
Nothing? [scoffs]

235
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,197
You're up, Timmy.

236
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,117
This is the first loop-de-loop
on the retail roller coaster.

237
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,036
Ask for the manager.

238
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,539
May I please discuss this return policy
with the manager?

239
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:24,915
He's busy.

240
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,920
Have you ever been on spring break?

241
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,047
You kidding?

242
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,508
I met my boyfriend
in an East Floridian sunscreen pit.

243
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,386
Well, I'm on spring break
and I'd like to see the manager.

244
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,971
Spring break!

245
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,433
Well, I can't say no to spring break law.

246
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:45,519
-Let me grab the manager.
-[line ringing]

247
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:49,065
So, I told the missus,
"You bring your folks to Lake Geneva,

248
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,234
-I'll be sleeping on the pontoon."
-[people laughing]

249
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,070
-Go, State!
-[all] Go, State!

250
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,155
[laughter continues]

251
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:59,283
Kuvitsky, is there really a need
for this expensive glossy paper

252
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,785
for intra-office memos?

253
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,703
[Carlisle] Biedermann, a word?

254
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:06,582
Carlisle! Do you know Kuvitsky,
the office general manager?

255
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:09,794
Of course I do.
I work here like a normal adult.

256
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,337
Excuse us, Kuvitsky.

257
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,172
You think I'm joking? Scram.

258
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,216
I can get a mail boy fired like that.
[snaps fingers]

259
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,260
Unfortunately, I'm not a mail boy anymore.

260
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:22,264
Five minutes ago, Kuvitsky promoted me
to assistant office general manager.

261
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,100
My job is to find budget cuts.

262
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:27,269
I'm gonna propose some streamlining, so...
[snaps fingers]

263
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,439
I'm like a broken furnace.
You're never gonna fire me.

264
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,400
Try me. [snapping]

265
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,442
[snapping]

266
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,195
I feel amazing!

267
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,988
I actually have a manager coming!

268
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,115
Never back down.

269
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,200
This store doesn't exist
without the customers,

270
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:44,495
so you got no reason to let
some suit-and-tie suck-up intimidate you.

271
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,080
May I serve you?

272
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,708
Ah! Steve-fan the flight attendant?

273
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,585
Well, howdy-do!

274
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,880
It's my favorite little passenger
who won't pronounce a name right,

275
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,049
even if it's sitting
right in front of him!

276
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,468
It's "Stevefan."

277
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,096
-You know this guy?
-Oh, yes!

278
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,849
This cool dude was the straw
that popped a hole in my dream life

279
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,559
of soaring over the oceans.

280
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:09,103
Now I'm stuck on the ground floor
of a skyscraper.

281
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:12,022
Really makes you laugh. [laughs]

282
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:12,940
One moment.

283
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:16,527
Attention, customers,
we're having a flash sale on intimates!

284
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,446
[chuckles] Underpants sale.

285
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,449
Now, how may I serve you, customer?

286
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,284
I'd like to return this, Steve-fan.

287
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:26,120
[chuckles] Over my store policy.

288
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:29,874
-Spring brea--
-I only honor the winter holidays.

289
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,084
[gasps] So cold!

290
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,462
Yeah, see, right there, guy.

291
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,006
[Kuvitsky] Corporate charter says
you do have the power

292
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,425
to fire an assistant
office general manager.

293
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:44,263
Find Biedermann so I can break it to him
that his position's been eliminated.

294
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,723
Here, Biffy Biffy!

295
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,685
Need a promotion! Need a promotion!
Need a promotion!

296
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,314
Eh! Dang complicated deal!

297
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,024
Superior in distress?

298
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,568
Corporate gods, you make me blush.

299
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:02,531
Hey, Garcia. What's wrong with my favorite
VP of Draft Acquisitions?

300
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:06,744
This Flowers Department Store acquisition
is a real busted hinge!

301
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,245
Can't find a way to close it!

302
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,747
Mind if I take a look?

303
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,459
Well, just leverage the pending
O'Keefe Data Systems merger

304
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:14,418
to sweeten the pot.

305
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,922
The Flowers deal will close
like a morning glory at noon.

306
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,340
That's...

307
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:23,511
You just secured us
an acquisition and a merger!

308
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:24,970
[laughter]

309
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,515
Assume firing positions.

310
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,434
[Garcia] I'd like to introduce you all
to our newly promoted

311
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,521
Associate VP of Mergers and Acquisitions!

312
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:34,730
[grumbles]

313
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,859
I'm not leaving until I get a refund
for this blouse.

314
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,863
Well, you're not getting a refund
on this blouse, so buh-bye.

315
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,365
I have a plan.

316
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,868
You distract him, I'll make things
very uncomfortable around here.

317
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,456
[Stevefan] Ah! You come back here
with my walkie!

318
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,626
Management here seems like
a real hard butt, huh?

319
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,586
Whoo! You said it there, guy.

320
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,922
Wanna know how to stick it to him?

321
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,551
Using mergers to maximize leverage
on acquisitions

322
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,679
puts us in a better position,
not only for stronger closings,

323
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:10,057
but also additional acquisitions!

324
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,936
Shh! The CEO is gonna speak.

325
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,939
So, you're an associate vice president,
Biedermann?

326
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,650
I'm also hardworking, whip-smart,
and immodest.

327
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:22,027
[all laughing]

328
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:23,779
Love it.

329
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:27,867
Wouldn't Biedermann be perfect to fill
our open chief financial officer job?

330
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,995
CFO? That's like the CEO of money!

331
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,497
-Yes, of course I'll take the job!
-[laughter continues]

332
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,416
Walk with me.

333
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,918
I want you to meet
our chief operating officer.

334
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,338
You'll be working hand in hand
to execute my corporate vision.

335
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,090
Ah, here he is.

336
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,843
Carlisle meet our new CFO Biedermann.

337
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,219
Biedermann, Carlisle.

338
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,221
-Carlisle.
-Biedermann.

339
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,056
Gotta run. I got hoops tickets later.

340
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,267
-Go, State!
-[people] Go, State!

341
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,394
So, you're COO.

342
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,438
That explains the strong hand
you've been playing.

You don't think I have
an ace up my sleeve?

344
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,360
My sleeve is made of aces,
so if you want to push, ante up.

345

knows anything about poker

347
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,158
other than the terminology?

348
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,036

Good luck. May the best baby
disguised as a man win.

Stace? I need you to fax some data
to a grown-up company in Chicago.

and you can have your walkie back!

-Good.

to say into the walkie.

363
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,376
[Tim] Attention, all worker people,
please report to the returns counter

364
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,795

by forming a union.

365

you'll get higher wages,

368
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,933
better hours, and, most of all, respect!

369
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,560
You set the terms.
You stick it to the man!

370
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,980
Union! Say it with me!

371
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,231

372
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:26,860
Hey, slugger, that room
is for trying on merchandise only.

373
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,779
I'm gonna need you to step out.

374
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:29,947
[Tim] Attention, shoppers.

-No!

376
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,994

without throwing up for ten seconds,

This is about justice!

Fair terms and fair wages

McHennessy, I have
something exciting to share.

389
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:19,455
Biedermann, Carlisle just made
a pretty convincing argument

390
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,539
for your termination.

391
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:24,001
Oh? Then I guess you're not interested
in seeing this folder.

392
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,546
I've prepared what I call
a vision redirect

393
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:30,799
for International Holdings
and Worldwide Investments, Incorporated.

394
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:31,967
Love it already. Go.

395
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,428
-What?
-Who doesn't love a vision redirect?

396
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,013
Babies.

397
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,056
-But--
-Shh!

398
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:41,018
As you can see by the market research,
babies are quickly becoming

399
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:44,521
not only the most loved thing,
but the only loved thing.

In conclusion,
this company's future is babies.

Biedermann, you're an invaluable part
of this company.

406
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,249
Carlisle, you're a nut-bird
for trying to can this guy.

407

McHennessy, we got big problems
at our newest acquisition.

Well, if she's blown a gasket,
we need an interim CEO, stat.

426
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,097
Got a developing crisis.

427
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,307
Well, as CFO, I'll take the job.

428
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,477
Um, no, I'm COO. I have seniority.

429
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,021
Really, you guys are co-equal heirs
to the throne,

430
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:11,942
and the company charter is very specific
on how to resolve this.

431

00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:14,903

So, what's the crisis, Garcia?

439
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:33,547
On your advice, we bought

440
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,091
the very profitable
Flowers Department Stores.

441
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,844
But while we were closing,
a grandmother and her grandson

442
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:42,973
came in to return a blouse and, somehow,
now the workers want to unionize?

443
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:46,518
Thank you, Garcia.
Leave me to confer with my COO, please.

444
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:51,064
Do I get to resign with dignity,
or you gotta humiliate me first?
