00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,930
You're sure about all this?

177
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,099
It's all straight
from Mega Fat's old voice memos.

178
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,684
Dude really loved to hear himself talk.

179
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,103
There's, like, five hours of him
just working on lyrics

180
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,771
for the "Ha Ha You're Fired" song.

181
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,608
Hee-hee-ha-ho, you're--
No, no, I can beat that.

182
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,735
Take a baby who doesn't get hurt easily,

183
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,613
use him to expose all the dangerous flaws
in baby products.

184
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,907
Hmm. It's actually not a bad idea.

185
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,202
Even a broken European clock
is right once a day.

186
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,704
But who told Boom Baby
to go after that high chair?

187
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,414
Nobody.

188
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,167
I mean, I'm going improv here, but...

189
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,585
[inhales]

190
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,586
I'm Boom Baby!

191
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,297
I haven't heard from Baby Corp
since Mega Fat got fired

192
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,174
and everybody forgot about me!

193
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,052
Wait. What's this letter?

194
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,846
Project Boom is cancelled?

195
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,264
Not if I can help it.

196
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,059
Maybe I'll just make
my own baby-proofing projects.

197
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:42,021
[gasps] He's gone rogue!
We need to stop this ASAP.

198
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,648
I want a meeting, in person.

199
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,234
Somebody get a message to Boom.

200
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,570
-[clatters]
-[stammers, gasps]

201
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,405
[toddler babbling]

202
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,950
No sign of him, Boss.

203
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,493
He could be plotting an ambush.

204
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,663
We need an emergency code phrase
in case things get hairy--

205
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,164
something we can all remember.

206
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,667
I remember dodgeball.
Don't wanna talk about it.

207
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,003
Ooh, how about, "Wow, I can't believe
this is going so well"?

208
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,380
Copy that, Boss.

209
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,966
Come on, big guy,
help me scout the perimeter.

210
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,095
All right, where are you hiding?

211
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,139
Ah-hh! Whew. My back needed this.

212
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,976
Boom Baby?

213
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,565
You're right, it's not a social call.
Let's talk business.

214
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,609
So, I'm un-cancelled?

215
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,111
Is that what this is about?

216
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,863
You just torpedoed
the world's safest high chair.

217
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,657
Not exactly winning Baby Corp over.

218
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,659
It was too high for a chair.

219
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,828
It's a high chair! [moans]

220
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,539
Look, your former service is appreciated,

221
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,416
but it's time to stand down.

222
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,586
Baby Corp's at war.
We don't need another distraction.

223
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,463
And frankly, we have test dummies
in the R&amp;D lab

224
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,383
that can do this job
without making a public scene.

225
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,427
You can't cancel me, cubicle boy.

226
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,845
I want to talk to the CEO.

227
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,431
Mega Fat's a friend.
He'll take the meeting.

228
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,349
[chuckles] Of course!

229
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,144
Oh, Boom Baby,
this is all a huge misunderstanding.

230
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,730
You've been out in the field so long,
you don't even know.

231
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:08,274
I'm the CEO. Boss Baby.

232
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:11,777
So, yes, I do have the authority
to cancel Project Boom,

233
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:15,448
but we'd love to find you some alternative
position within the comp--

234
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:18,075
-Where are you going?
-Ha! I knew you weren't Baby Corp.

235
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,786
A handshake? That's for dogs.

236
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,371
Is that who you're working for?

237
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,332
PuppyCo trying to shut down my work?

238
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,292
Am I the only true Baby Corper left?

239
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,461
[yells] Wow, I can't believe
this is going so well!

240
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,046
-[screams]
-Huh...?

241
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,715
You're coming back to Baby Corp.

242
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:36,177
Let the airplane land!

243
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,220
[Jimbo] Suck, suck, suck, suck,
suck, suck, suck, suck!

244
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,014
[grunts]

245
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,224
Nice try, but I'm used to
spitting out stuff

246
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,809
babies shouldn't have eaten.

247
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:47,605
You thought a conspiracy of fakers could
stop me making this world safe for babies?

248
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,983
All you did was unleash me.

249
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,026
[gasps]

250
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,445
[clatters]

251
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,155
Agh! [yelps]

252
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,033
-Boom, please listen.
-That's gonna be hard.

253
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:02,119
This place is about to get loud.

254
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,539
-[squeals]
-[moans]

255
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,208
-[babies wailing]
-Do they look safer to you?

256
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,544
They will be,
now that I got their attention.

257
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,796
[mother] Oh, sweetie!

258
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,589
[voices overlapping]

259
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:15,633
No, no, no, no, no!

260
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:21,430
Boom!

261
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,225
He's good.

262
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:25,518
This is bad.

263
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:29,355
[Marsha] What was once a safe haven
for mommies to read romance novels

264
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,732
is now shut down and exposed

265
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,026
as a hotbed of baby contusions.

266
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,780
[groans] Another bastion
of parental comfort gone belly-up!

267
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,240
What does Boom Baby want?

268
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:42,493
A world where parents have their babies
strapped to them 24-7?

269
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,453
I mean, yeah, probably.

270
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,330
If Boom keeps stressing out
parents like this,

271
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,959
we won't have to worry about war
with Pyg &amp; Tam, OCB, or PuppyCo.

272
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,002
We won't have any baby love left to lose!

273
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,923
We have to stop him,
the way Boss stopped our dodgeball team!

274
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,633
You are really hung up on the dodgeb--

275
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:01,053
-I said I don't wanna talk about it!
-Jimbo, if you won't even talk to me--

276
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,640
I know who Boom Baby will talk to!

277
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:09,103
And how are we getting Mega Fat
Normal Retired Baby to play along?

278
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,730
I'm on it. Just get a fix
on Boom Baby's location.

279
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,691
And somebody track down my brother!

280
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,694
[laughing]

281
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,280
[Danny] Oh, I love playing

282
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,782
"Think About If Dinosaurs
Had Longer Arms Than Legs."

283
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:25,870
We should turn it into a game show!
We'd be so rich and famous!

284
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:29,665
Eh, I can go for rich, but probably
gotta hold off on getting famous.

285
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:32,877
My dad was worried enough
that time you and me got on the TV news.

286
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,670
-[Tim grunts]
-The government watches all the channels,

287
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:38,007
even the half-channels
they can't tell you about in TV school.

288
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,844
Templeton, does the house
only have chunky?

289
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:42,761
Chunky what?

290
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,388
Still working on the settings.

291
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,640
-Is Mega Fat left-handed or--
-Right!

292
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,934
-Right, chunky what?
-Listen faster!

293
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,394
-You got it, Boss!
-On it!

294
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,063
Listen faster to what? Can I hang up now?

295
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,107
Of course not.
This won't work if we don't have you.

296
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,067
These are the coolest glasses
I could find.

297
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,945
-Smooth.
-We get it, you look cool for a baby.

298
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,740
-No, I need smooth.
-We have eyes on Boom!

299
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:06,410
Just get to the town square.
Bring straws and smooth peanut butter!

300
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:07,703
I gotta go.

301
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,706
What about "Think About If Dinosaurs
Had Bigger Arms Than Legs"?

302
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:14,001
-Play it one-player!
-But it doesn't work one-player!

303
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,420
[laughs]

304
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,506
Oh, wait. Yeah, it does. [laughing]

305
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:23,052
[Baby Boom] All these people,
walking around like their babies are safe

306
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,305
when every corner is sharp,
every quarter shiny enough to eat.

307
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,598
But we're gonna show them, chief.

308
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:30,643
After today, it won't matter
if they shut down Project Boom.

309
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,937
Today, baby safety
takes a flying leap into--

310
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,854
[voice] Hello?

311
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,858
It's me. Nice to see... you.

312
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,611
[gasps] Mega Fat CEO Baby!

313
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,364
I really don't think
we should have involved him.

314
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:46,742
There's zero danger.
Boom Baby idolizes Mega Fat.

315
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:49,453
And that's why Mega Fat's the only one
who can fire him.

316
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:53,749
I knew if I just kept doing my job
the way you told me, you'd come around.

317
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,626
Very good. So nice to see you.

318
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:58,295
Been a long time.
I love chocolate pudding.

319
00:13:58,587 --> 00:13:59,463
What was that?

320
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,884
Oopsie! We mislabeled some of the clips
from Mega Fat's voice diary.

321
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,177
We can fix it! Easy!

322
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,305
So easy, I can fix it with my butt!
[clicking]

323
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,600
Secrets. Yes! Way to go!

324
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,103
Code phrase.
[clicks tongue] I get it.

325
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,438
I also like "pudding."

326
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,568
-[gasps] I didn't rig him for handshakes!
-[recording] Up high!

327
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,320
-That's a good thing. Watch.
-But not really. I'm important and busy.

328
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,030
Very unprofessional.

329
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:29,201
Nice. You of anyone would know
handshakes are for dogs, sir.

330
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,954
My dogs are barking. Shake on it.

331
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,831
[recording] Never with me, I say.

332
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,833
[Boom Baby] Tell me about it.
Can't be too careful, though.

333
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,211
There's a rogue pack of Baby Corp fakers
trying to shut me down.

334
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,921
Unreal! Baby Corp?

335
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,340
"Don't pretend with me," I said.
I stopped them.

336
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,842
You stopped them? [laughs]

337
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,303
So, we're safe! Good!

338
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,638
'Cause what
I've prepared here, it's gonna--

339
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,140
-[babbling]
-Sir?

340
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,559
[gasps] He's starting to talk for himself!

341
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,978
Keep that mouth busy!
Peanut butter's running low!

342
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,146
[Tim] On it.

343
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,107
[inhales, puffs]

344
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,444
[babbling]

345
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,446
[smacking]

346
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,990
Shake the chair.
Give me some head nodding.

347
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:08,908
[knuckles crackle]

348
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,286
I love it when we share memories.
Love you, big guy!

349
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:15,748
Aha! I see, yes. I hear that.

350
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,708
You've always been a great listener.

351
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,210
Move to phase two. Let him down easy.

352
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:23,088
Approaching to gentle, friendly proximity.

353
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,965
Good news: good job!

354
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,967
I knew you'd be behind me on this.

355
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,720
Bad news? Ho-ho ho-ho, you're fired!

356
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,263
[laughing]

357
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,848
That's a funny joke, old pal!

358
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,475
Now, come on, let's trigger this.

359
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,143
[recording] No joking.

360
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,978
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo. Ach!

361
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,855
He's maybe...? Hoo, hoo?

362
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,690
Ha, ha, ha, ha. You're fired!

363
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,859
Oh, yes! That is the one!

364
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,570
Score it for me, Mega Fat CEO Baby!

365
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,864
Whoa... so...

366
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,366
this is really happening?

367
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,451
Yes, cowboy in the saddle.

368
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,079
Some luxurious inflatables. Night-night!

369
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,872
-You're the boss.
-Yes!

370
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:58,415
[sighs]

371
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,751
Guess this is the last mission, then.

372
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,712
No! What? He's fired now! Tell him--

373
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,507
Project Boom could never keep up
with all the dangers out there.

374
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,677
But that's exactly the solution--
out there.

375
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,470
We just gotta show
all the mommies and daddies

376
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,348
how unsafe it is
to ever bring their babies outside!

377
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,976
[Boom Baby]
I've booby-trapped the entire town square

378
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,686
-with everyday outdoor dangers.
-[crying]

379
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,521
-And I'm gonna hit every one!
-Ow!

380
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,314
I will cry hard.

381
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,650
Parents will be horrified.
-[wailing]

382
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,443
And when the talcum powder settles,

383
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,904
people are gonna swaddle their babies
in bubble wrap

384
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,907
and never, ever leave the house again!

385
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,535
-[all gasp]
-[man] I found it attached to my doorknob.

386
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,453
-[man 2] Yeah!
-All right!

387
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,038
Here come our guests.

388
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:41,291
Are you guys here for the free
safety demonstration from Project Boom?

389
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,252
-Oh, of course! We love safety.
-[man 3] Yeah!

390
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,921
We need to get Boom
to abort this mission, now!

391
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,715
Tim, keep that peanut butter coming.

392
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,341
[inhales]

393
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,927
-Triplets?
-Engage, my brothers!

394
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,178
[giggles]

395
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,473
[recording] Tasty readily abject ridicule
in as much as dirigible.

396
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,808
Mega Fat?

397
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,185
We're under fire! Get down!

398
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,520
[giggles, murmurs]

399
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:02,730
Hit him again!

400
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,065
[inhales, coughs]

401
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,650
It went down the wrong pipe! Ulp!

402
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:09,486
[Mega Fat squeals]

403
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:10,946
[giggling]

404
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,490
[sniffing]

405
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,742
[Boom Baby] Peanut butter?

406
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,495
[babbling]

407
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,290
-What?
-Simmons, get him out of there!

408
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,083
All thrusters to double left!

409
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,086
-[whirring]
-[Mega Fat squeals]

410
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,129
[Boss Baby] Ugh!

411
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,131
-[triplets] Whoa!
-[thumps]

412
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:33,677
-[wails] What did they do to you?
-[Boss Baby] Stand down, Boom.

413
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,512
Mega Fat wouldn't want this to happen.

414
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,891
You think a faker like you
knows Mega Fat better than me?

415
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:42,019
We had matching tattoos
that he was always too busy to show me!

416
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,687
He's changed since you knew him.

417
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,023
He has a mother now. Marsha Krinkle.

418
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,692
The TV reporter!

419
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,402
You're a celebrity baby?

420
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,196
[Boom Baby] That changes everything!

421
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,656
It should be you
having all these outside accidents.

422
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,076
People will pay way more attention!

423
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,243
What? No!

424
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,704
Baby want a blocky-block?

425
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,206
[murmurs, giggles]

426
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,709
-I always put the fastener on the cap.
-Safety is very important to me.

427
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,295
-What?
-Staci, distract the parents.

428
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,880
I'll stop Mega Fat from...

429
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,591
crawling into a pile
of sharp, pokey jacks?

430
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,259
This Boom Baby is sick!

431
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,928
Mega Fat, stop!

432
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,554
[Mega Fat babbling]

433
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,683
Boom, let's talk about this. Oop!

434
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,477
Nah.

435
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,270

-Mega Fat, look out! Agh!
-[others gasp]

[Jimbo whimpers, yelps]

440
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,825
[screaming] Ugh!

441
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,576
Oh, my gosh! Baby, are you okay?

442
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,786
[squealing, giggling]

443
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,788
-Come on, let's get you to your--
-[Boom Baby] Yoo-hoo!

444
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,543
-Mm!
-[grunts] We can get you...

445
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,419
[groaning] so many more blocks!

446
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,337
Ulp!

447
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,630
Oh-hh!

448
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,173
Oop! [gasps]

449
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,551
[thumping]

450
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,806
Oh, come on!
How is this a realistic danger scenario?

451
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,559
What if a baby wandered into a food fight?

452
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,645
-It could happen-- outside.
-[Mega Fat babbling]

453
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,856
Ouch! Ooh, coconut!

454
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,691
Turn those things off! Agh!

455
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,318
[Boom Baby] Land sakes!

456
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:17,614
Everything outside is so terribly unsafe!

457
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,742
Why isn't anyone looking?

458
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,869
[bell jingles]

459
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,829
Safety baby is right.

460
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,873
We should remember
to put a helmet on our kids

461
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,958
before they get on a trike.

462
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,501
-Ha-hah!
-Oh!

463
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,086
[both grunting]

464
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,337
Ah-hh!

00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,631
[both grunting]

-Didn't anyone teach you to share?

00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,222
[giggles]

469
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,766
Sure, they did. Your turn.

470
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,561
-Take the shot, Jimbo!
-[grunts]

471
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,563
[tires screech]

472
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,818
Well, I'm sorry!

473
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,654
But this is what happens
when you cut dodgeball!

474
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,323
Now we're talking about this?!

475
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,991
We have to save Mega Fat-- oof!

476
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:04,536
Oh, look who suddenly cares
about Mega Fat!

477
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,457
Because I'm pretty sure
he was a happy, retired regular baby

478
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,667
before you threw him into this mess!

479
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:11,960
[bangs]

480
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,755
So, we're not talking about dodgeball?

481
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,507
You make these big, important decisions...

482
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:18,508
[banging]

483
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,344
and it's like you don't even think about

484
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,971
how it's going to affect
anybody but yourself!

485
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,390
That's just... poop!

486
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:26,600
[thumps]

487
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,105
You're right.

488
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,275
I told myself I was doing this
for the good of babies.

489
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,111
Oh. I was actually talking to Boss-- ulp!

490
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,656
Maybe I even meant it.

491
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,700
But when you really think
about the babies you care for--

492
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,786
Mega Fat, don't!

493
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,704
[thumping]

494
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,331
-[Jimbo] No!
-[Boss Baby] Wait!

495
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,168
[distorted] No-oo!

496
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:54,711

00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,506
-[coos]
-[Marsha] There's my chubster!

498
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:02,552
Nothing like a beautiful, safe day
in the great outdoors, huh, Chubby Lovey?

499
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,139
-Nice dodging back there.
-Thank you.

500
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:10,018
Technically, this means
we won the game, so... um...

501
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,104
Yes, I'll buy you ice cream.

502
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,563
-Yeah!
-[groans]

503
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:14,564

[inhales]

505
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,527
Sorry, new boss.

506
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:22,239
I guess the biggest threat
to baby safety was... me.

507
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,742
You kidding? You're the most dedicated
safety baby I've ever met.

508
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,828
We could use your experience.

509
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:31,498
Appreciate that, but a baby's gotta know
when it's time to clock out.

510
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:35,127
-I'm ready for retirement.
-If that's what you want.

511
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,170
Just one last favor?

512
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,547
[squeaks]

513
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,800
These test dummies are amazing!

514
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,260
How much heat can they withstand?

515
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,597
-[bangs]
-Anything from sunburns to the actual sun.

516
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:48,974
What do they eat?

517
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,018
Er... they're not real people.

518
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,729
Yet, I feel such a brotherhood with them.

519
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,063
It's on you now.

520
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,649
Promise me you'll keep this world safe
for the little guys.

521
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,775
Still not people.

522
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,403
It's weird for me when he humanizes them.

523
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,488
I gotta blow these things up.

524
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:06,116
All right, Boss, let's do this.

525
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,451
[whirrs]

526
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,329
We've matched you
with a family of top scientists.

527
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:13,874
By the time you grow up, you'll be
keeping babies safe with particle physics!

528
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,126
[sniffles] Love it.

529
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,045
It's for Mega Fat.

530
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,629
Tell him I said bye, will ya?

531
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,092
Yo, Boss.

532
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,804
Jimbo said you restored the budget
for dodgeball and community theater?

533
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,140
Well, I saw how much it meant to them.

534
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:34,144
And I found a way to save overhead
and justify it as war preparation.

535
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,062
[thumping]

536
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:39,274
Is this a dodgeball
which I see before me-- ugh!

537
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:42,277
-I love the classics!
-[thumps]

538
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,135
Boss Baby
