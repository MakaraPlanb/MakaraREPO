So, is this a coincidence,
or a declaration of war?

171
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,950
-We don't want trouble.
-I kind of do.

172
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,078
Keep piling on the enemies.
Make a whole sandwich of them.

173
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,914
I'll cut off the crusts
and slice it in half!

174
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:04,627
[stuttering]
Um, we meet him at his house.

175
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,504
Yes, I know. The yard sale.

176
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:09,507
Did one of your mommies or daddies
just buy this because you liked it?

177
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:14,470
[stuttering]
Yes! And that today we were travelling.

178
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,806
We traveled back here.

179
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:20,476
Of course, to the place you hang out
and play with your friends!

180
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,563
-I can't believe it.
-It wasn't a declaration of war!

181
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,983
No, I mean that I'm actually having
a rational conversation with a preek.

182
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,736
If I promise to buy you
a brand-new Football Mike,

183
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,281
will you give me back
the one from the yard sale?

184
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,325
Tomatoes.

185
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,202
And that's more like it.

186
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,205
-Ooh!
-What?

187
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,416
-Where's the toy?
-[OCB] Missing something?

188
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,252
Eh, eh, eh, eh?

189
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,004
Trace the call. I'll stall him.

190
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,381
He is clearly in the vents.

191
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,425
[Boss Baby] I thought I smelled trouble.

192
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,261
Or is it an over-splashing of cologne?

193
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,471
Dollop Number Four.

194
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,557
All you need...
[sniffing]

195
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,891
...is a dollop.

196
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,560
You're hawking cologne now?

197
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,980
No. I am hawking Dollop Number Four.

198
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,690
-Stop saying that!
-Can't.

199
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:11,235
When you're handsome, they give you money
just to say product names out loud

200
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,405
so it gets stuck in the heads
of the less attractive.

201
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,991
-Dollop Number Four.
-Jimbo!

202
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,118
-It drips off the tongue!
-Pow!

203
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,162
Pay me. I'm handsome.

204
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:24,624
So, you're all about money?
Then name your price for the toy.

205
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,335
Oh, you know the price. You've said it.

206
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,920
I believe it was "priceless"?

207
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,131
You got bugged, son!

208
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,258
Just tell me what you want!

209
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,845
What have I always wanted? Duh! Your job.

210
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,640
OCB, CEO.

211
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,224
Feel it? Yeah!

212
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,601
[scoffs]
Never.

213
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:46,687
Well, then, "Hut-hut!" Buh-bye.

214
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,356
Tell me you found him.

215
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,191
Beep, boop, bop, boop.

216
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,069
Oh, no way! He's in the vents.

217
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:56,113
-Let's go get that toy!
-And OCB?

218
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,200
-Because Baby Corp's at war with him?
-Of course. Both things.

219
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,284
Now, come on!

220
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,540
[sniffs]
I can smell the Dollop Number Four.

221
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:07,833
[OCB] Heard you say it!

222
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,001
[groans]
That way!

223
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,720
Dollop Number Four!
[groaning]

224
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,015
I'd say it was a pleasure
doing business with you,

225
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,851
but since I despise you
and your career, I'll just say...

226
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:26,936
[coos]

227
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,314
[squeaks]

228
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:34,151
Ha! Doggy bone. Can honestly say
I didn't see that coming.

229
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,403
Talk!

230
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,654
Where is it? Tell me!

231
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,155
BB...

232
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,034
-You're working with PuppyCo?
-Psh!

233
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,246
Like they can afford my day rate.
I've checked.

234
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:48,707
[gasps]
Remembering. Flashback? Yeah, sure!

235
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,545
Worked up some BO during our chase,

236
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:56,132
so I paused to apply Dollop Number Four.

237
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,426
All you need is a dollop.

238
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,015
Ha-ha! Wow, chief!

239
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:08,269
Looks like everybody got ears
on Baby Corp.

240
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,687
-[groans]
-Stop gloating!

241
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,148
Applesauce team, to the doggy park!

242
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,776
You could use a dollop, BB.
You reek of desperation.

243
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,361
Dollop Number Four!

244
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,364
-What are you doing?
-Going after the toy!

245
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,783
[both grunting]

246
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,035
Forget the toy! We have OCB.

247
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,329
-Update, you don't.
-[Boss Baby] No!

248
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,707
[grunts]

249
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,668
You're going after OCB, right?

250
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:35,921
Uh, eventually? But first, I gotta get
Football Mike back from PuppyCo.

251
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,590
-See you soon!
-What? No!

252
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:38,674
[groans]

253
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:40,551
[barks]

254
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,512
[Boss baby] Doggy bag.

255
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,848
Looks like we're ordering take-out.

256
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,308
Frankie, you're up.

257
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,356
-[clatters]
-[barking]

258
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,735
Puppies are taking the bait.
Remember, slide and pause.

259
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:01,238
[Frankie] Slide and pause.
Slide and pause.

260
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,781
Slide and pause.

261
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,078
[sniffing]

262
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,373
Is that...
[gasps]

263
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,667
No, no, no...

264
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,377
[barking]

265
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,713
Frankie, no! Lead them away from us!

266
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:21,091
-[Boss Baby] Slide and pause!
-Did you see what that dog did to me?

267
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:24,011
I assumed you'd have
a higher tolerance for grossness,

268
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,888
as an other person's booger eater.

269
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:30,392
It's not about the booger source,
it's about the length of time!

270
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,520
Whoa! Whoa!

271
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,812
[all groan]

272
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,817
What's in here, Bug?
Is it a juicy steak? Tennis ball?

273
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,403
An important toy you hoped to use
as leverage against me?

274
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,280
[barking]

275
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,450
Word of advice,

276
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,036
next time you steal
from someone who stole from me,

277
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,622
don't let your stuff be so stolen.

278
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:52,915
Huh?

279
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:57,503
"Mikey got plumb nicked. Cheers."

280
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,129
[gasps]
Phony British slang

281
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,340
from someone
who's clearly never been in country.

282
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,008
Pyg and Tam.

283
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:06,095
Staci, I want Ducky team prepped
for Football Mike retrieval.

284
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,013
Can we go back to planning a war?

285
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,432
Can Tim go back to playing
with his beloved toy?

286
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,018
No, he cannot! Get me Ducky team.

287
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:17,147
My father told me
the juggling man will always put food

288
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,567
on his family's table.

289
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,611
No, child!
Banana is the unjuggleable fruit!

290
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,530
[gasping]

291
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,200
[in British accent]
That party went bananas, yeah?

292
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,161
[audience cheering]

293
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:36,125
The footy fella? Yeah, we blagged it.

294
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,960
Easy as figgy pudding.

295
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,545
[in normal accent]
Why steal it from Bug?

296
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,714
I thought you three
were in animal cahoots.

297
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,257
[in British accent]
It's war, bruv.

298
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,802
We still want your office,
and we'll do what it takes to get it.

299
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,304
[in normal accent]
So, what'll you accept

300
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,680
in exchange for the toy?

301
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,391
[in British accent]
You trying to make a deal, bruv?

302
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:53,601
[in normal accent]
No.

303
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,937
I'm negotiating one.

304
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,233
[in high-pitched voice]
Slag him!

305
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,985
[in normal voice]
As you wish, Mr. Pyg.

306
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,658
No production facilities.

307
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:11,994
No Football Mike.

308
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:16,248
No facilities, but production satellite
access with oversight.

309
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,083
Weekdays?

310
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,628
Weekends.

311
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,964
-Every other one.
-Every weekend.

312
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,591
Deal!

313
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:28,886
[bleats]

314
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,096
Did we win?

315
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,141
Considering we don't even have
production satellites? Yes.

316
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:38,312
[gasps]
The toy is gone!

317
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,732
[in British accent]
Are you having a laugh, Maria Maria?

318
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:44,193
[in normal accent]
I am having no laughs. It's gone!

319
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,694
There was only this.

320
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:51,075
Must have been left behind
by whoever took the Football Mike.

321
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,493
[clears throat]

322
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,745
[in British accent]
American Football Mike.

323
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,622
[in normal accent]
So, who has it now?

324
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,166
-[Maria Maria] Bug the Pug!
-OCB!

325
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,168
[in British accent]
It's clearly a bit of puppy sweater!

326
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,171
[in normal accent]
No, it's from OCB's pocket square!

327
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,131
Pretty sure.

328
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,967
[in British accent]
We're going after that pup.

329
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,428
And when we get your toy,
you're gonna give us what we want,

330
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:16,308
or we give the toy
the ol' yarny one-two-three.

331
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,894
[in normal accent]
So, we're going after OCB?

332
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,646
[yells]
I don't know!

333
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,147
Are you okay, boss?

334
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:26,402
No! I broke my brother's heart.
I can't fix it without his Football Mike.

335
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,238
And I can't get Football Mike
because I've got three enemy forces

336
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,115
turning me into a monkey in the middle!

337
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,951
I don't like being a monkey.
Or in the middle!

338
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,370
[gasps]
We need to destroy the middle.

339
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,580
Staci, gather the troops, all of them!

340
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,665

341
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:45,170
There's enough diapers here
to soak up the Mississippi!

342
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,923
-Is this about the war?
-It better be.

343
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,342
Another day at the office.

344
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,303
Babies and puppies duked it out
on the soccer field.

345
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,347
Just another day at the office.

346
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:59,059
Exotic TV celebs tried to evict us.

347
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,729
Just another day at the office.

348
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:05,774
A consultant tried to fix a place
that needs no fixing.

349
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,694
Another day at ol' Baby Corp.

350
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,864
But when baddies use
my brother's favorite toy

351
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:15,576
as leverage against me, that's personal.

352
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,119
-No more nice babies!
-[jeering]

353
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,830
-Are we in the middle of a war?
-Yes!

354
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,250
Are we gonna pause it
to find my brother's toy?

355
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,503
-Yeah!
-It sounds like we probably are!

356
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:30,215
That Football Mike is the bait
in a game of monkey in the middle,

357
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,426
so we're gonna close off the middle.

358
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,595
Attack every enemy at once.

359
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:37,931
Find your name, find your target,
and let's get to work.

[babies cheering]

361
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:48,317
Yellow 100 also means
I give a hundred percent at home.

362
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,360
But it's not just you giving,

363
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,572
you're committing the whole company
to a lost toy search!

364
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,075
I know, but I can't focus on my job

365
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,827
when all I can see
is that look Tim gave me.

366
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,038
Yeah, you screwed up, but what you--

367
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,207
And you named a diaper after smallpox.

368
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,125
But do you see me complaining? No.

369
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,961
Because I don't hold grudges.
But I do keep tabs.

370
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,923
And right now, my tab journal says
you owe me one.

371
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,009
Wow. So it's like that?

372
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,053
Today, it is.

Cuddle team in position.

377
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,944
Where's your mommy and daddy?
Gonna need grown-up money for those.

378
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,904
Great choice.

379
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,323
Can I get you anything else?
Water? Juice box?

380
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,742
Green light! All teams, go, go, go!

00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:44,206
-[baby 2] Pyg and Tam are making the run.
-[Staci] Don't let OCB out of that store!

383
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,375
[baby 2] Goat's got something.
Anyone have a visual?

384
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,085
[Frankie] Puppies running, and fast!

385
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,795
[Staci] OCB's headed south
on Kazoo Avenue.

386
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:52,965
[Frankie] I see Football Mike!
Bug's got Football Mike!

387
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:53,882
Yes!

388
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,509
[baby 2] I've got eyes
on Football Mike, too.

389
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,636
[Staci] Wait! OCB has a Football Mike.

390
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,513
[baby 2] Which one do we take out?

391
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,723
Tim's Football Mike
has customized markings on it.

392
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,683
Do you see any?

393
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,978
[Staci] Not exactly something you can see
during a full-on chase!

394
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:09,148
All right, give me a second.
I said one second!

395
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,233
[gasps]
How in the...

396
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,820
[stuttering]
He's, like, up to here.

397
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,780
It was in your toy chest? Again?

398
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,116
Custom marker job!

399
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,617
All teams, call off the pursuit!

400
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,202
[Boss Baby]
I have the right Football Mike!

401
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,328
What? How?

402
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,039
They messed up. Who cares? But I have it.

403
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,500
All teams, back to Baby Corp.
I'll see you in five.

404
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,170
I found it! I found Football Mike!

405
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,213
Oh, thanks.

406
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:36,300
Thanks? That's it? Do you have any idea
what I've been through?

407
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,594
Who said I was upset about Football Mike?

408
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,845
Who said you were upset?

409
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,430
You were more depressed
than a sushi chef...

410
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,266
-Danny Petrosky's moving.
-...in a land-locked state.

411
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,561
-Petrosky's moving?
-His dad saw an unmarked van in town.

412
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:50,063
Might be FBI mind-trackers
on the hunt, might not.

413
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:53,567
But you can't be too safe
with agents who can smell your thoughts.

414
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,321
-When did you find out?
-At the yard sale.

415
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,364
Mr. Petrosky doesn't like
to leave a trace,

416
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,492
so Danny asked me to sell
all their personal belongings.

417
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,579
[sighs]

418
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,958
-Tim, I get it.
-No, you don't!

419
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,877
-You're a baby.
-Exactly.

420
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,172
Every time someone covers my eyes,
I think they've disappeared forever.

421
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,507
Right now, for all I know,
you're on Neptune.

422
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,176
Oh, thank peek-a-boo, still here.

423
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,471
Really? Because, honestly,
that sounds like a constant nightmare.

424
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,681
Why do you think we're always crying?

425
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,601
We just learn to live
in the open-eye times.

426

[Staci] BB, come in!

427

You've still got Danny for now, don't you?

00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:39,529
-You good if I hang out with him?
-BB, come in! It's urgent!

Yeah. You know, work.

-What's up?
-Chupie tech's gone all haywire.

What's going on?

00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:51,291

Previous flashback? Fake flashback.
