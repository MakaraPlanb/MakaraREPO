Kudos to Amal on streamlining
the approvals process.

14
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:55,054
Fifteen percent paperwork reduction?

[scrambling quietly]

20
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:06,775
I got it, honey.

21
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,986
Templeton? I got ten cases of--

22
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,071
Baby food?

23
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,698
Look, I'm sorry,
I know it's not your fault,

24
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,659
and I don't know what bulk order
delivery list we ended up on,

25
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:21,498
but I promise, no one in this house
ordered ten cases of baby food

26
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,666

27
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,461
More for me.

28
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,255
Ooh, boy, Ted.

You know we can't hide everybody
from Mom and Dad forever.

34
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,690
-We need a plan to take back Baby Corp.
-I have a plan.

35
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,859
What I lack is access to Baby Corp.

36
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,028
Where are we on a transport chupie
workaround?

37
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:54,614
Does this answer your question?

38
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,165
Not close.

39
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:09,045
Hey, guys, quick HR update.
The diaper wagon is full again.

40
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,507
I'm learning how to eat broccoli!

41
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:16,177
-I got it.
-Hang on, I'll come with you.

42
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:19,973
And I mean bless Simmons
for her reckless experimentation,

43
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,767
but we have to fix
the chupie transport system itself,

44
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,019
which can only be done from the office.

45
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:29,274
So, we can't get back to Baby Corp
without getting back to Baby Corp.

46
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,818
There has to be another way
to kick out your enemies.

47
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,236
How is that your only idea?

48
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,906
I don't know. Maybe it's just really hard
to think with an office-load of babies

49
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,492
soiling themselves
over every inch of our basement.

50
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,537
And apparently I can't even get
two minutes of downtime

51
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,999
without some random preeks clattering
like it's Take Your Hyena to Work Day

52
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,458
at the leaf blower factory!

53
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,711
Wait, those aren't random preeks.

54
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,088
They're the ones
renting part of your office.

55
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,047
Not possible.

56
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:57,260
-Business!
-Boss Baby!

57
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,933
Thank you for the surprise!

58
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:10,023
-But there's still more animals.
-All yours. Negotiation over.

59
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:13,985
Just, please, can you tell me
how you've been getting back and forth

60
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,070
from your "play office"?

61
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:23,036
When it was my birthday party,
we were playing with our swords.

62
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:29,292
Okay, can you show me
how you've been getting there?

63
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:31,794
Yes.

64
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,631
[Staci]
There's a back door to Baby Corp?

65
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:39,636
An old, forgotten emergency access port.
One side opens to a fake tree in the park.

66
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:43,765
The other side--
a sub-basement level of Baby Corp.

67
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,308
We've got our way in!

68
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,976
[cheering]

69
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,479
All right, the job's not done yet.

70
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,273
We've still got three sets
of arch-nemeses to boot out.

71
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,068
I'll be going in
with a small, hand-picked team.

72
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:58,655
We enter through the sub-basement access,
make our way up to the roof--

73
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,531
tippy-top control tower.

74
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,117
Whatever our enemies are using
to hijack our systems,

75
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,036
Simmons figures it has to be up there.

76
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,163
Look for anything out of place.

77
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:11,084
A contraption, a whatchamadoo,
possibly a thingerybob.

78
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:14,003
Good news-- we have ruled out
whatchahoosits.

79
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,214
Whatever it is, we take it out.

80
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:20,718
And once our transport chupies
are working, in jumps everybaby.

81
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,726
Out go the baddies,
we hit that beautiful Yellow 100,

82
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,272
and I retire in a flame
of baby love glory.

83
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,065
Sir? Great plan.

84
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,859
Love the part where babies
who aren't me take all the risks,

85
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:41,656
but wouldn't it save a few steps if we all
just went in the secret access door?

86
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:45,076
As long as our enemies control
the chupie transport tech,

87
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:48,037
they can strike anywhere
and vanish just as quickly.

88
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,457
No, our only shot
is with a small, stealthy team.

89
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:56,337
Jimbo, Katja and Phil, Frankie,
Hendershot, Dondre, Triplets,

90
00:04:56,421 --> 00:05:00,675
and of course Tim
for big-kid tactical support and snacks.

91
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:04,595
The rest of you will be running
a diversion down here, so gear up.

92
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:08,016
Today, we take back Baby Corp!

93
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:15,398
Hey, Boss, heard a lot of names
for that stealthy field team,

94
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,984
but not your VP of Field Ops?

95
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,403
Of course not.
You're heading the diversion team.

96
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,906
Is this still about
my diaper marketing disaster?

97
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,492
Or did I do something else wrong?

98
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,619
What? No, neither.

99
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,413
I need you down here.

100
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,582
Bad guys jammed our monitors, too.

101
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,667
When the time comes
to chupie in the cavalry,

102
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,670
your team will have no way of knowing
if my team did its job,

103
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,672
that you won't get bounced away to Siberia

104
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,884
or some liberal arts college
with a pinecone for a mascot.

105
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:46,554
This plan only works
if the two team leaders trust each other

106
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,431
to do their jobs perfectly.

107
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,727
And in my book,
that means it only works if it's you.

108
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,937
Tell me what you want me to do.

109
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,607
One hour, on the dot.

110
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,610
I will destroy that jamming device,
no matter what.

111
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,111
And we'll be there.

112
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,198
-Yellow 100.
-Yellow 100.

113
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,787
They say this is the one
with the secret door.

114
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:19,087
-Saliva activated?
-That does sound like our technology.

115
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,052
We're in!

They're like business babies!

119
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,486
Aw, look at their little tiny neckties.

120
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:49,075
Look at that! Get your camera, somebody!

00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:56,082
Bizbabies! Is it a marketing stunt?

123
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:59,502
A maternity ward with a sense of humor
and appalling security?

124
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:04,757
In this reporter's judgment, who cares?
Embrace the adorability.

125
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:09,303
A'course it's Boss Baby, ya manky git.

-Finish him!
-I'm with the goat.

127
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,852
Split up for the hunt, somebody finds
Boss Baby, calls in the rest of us, pow!

128
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,896
Take out the king,
take down the whole chessboard.

129
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,940
I assume. Chess is for dorks.

130
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:25,486
-Ooh, great plan.
-A moment, Mr. Pyg, Mr. Tam.

131
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,114
I smell media manipulation.

132
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:32,618
A circus sideshow to keep everyone
looking exactly where he wants.

133
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:37,915
So, where does Boss Baby
want us not looking?

134
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,049
-Where's the night light?
-What?

135
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,134
I'm a baby, man.

136
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:51,053
We don't just walk into a dark hallway
without a night light.

137
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,514
That's how the Shadowsnatcher gets you.

138

Yes, we all acknowledge the terrifying
existence of the Shadowsnatcher.

139
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,103
But do you see any of us being eaten?

140
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,438
No...

141
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,732
Probably because of the bad lighting.

142
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:04,942
What's the holdup?

143
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:08,779
You're blocking the portal
and we are on a schedule, so come on.

144
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,282
Not without a night light.

145
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,951
They're in the sub-basement!

146
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,246

-I think Hendershot got captured.

one of the Triplets, too.

154
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,813
-So, what do we do?
-No way to warn Staci.

155
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,149
Which means in 49 minutes,
a whole lot of babies

00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,151
are gonna chupie themselves into trouble

157

unless somebody gets up to the roof
and takes out that jamming device.

Hey, when all this is over
and I retire to being a regular baby,

make sure I never develop
any stupid hang-ups about night lights.

-Why are you not writing this?
-What?

00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,839
I'm gonna be a drooling ga-ga head
who forgot everything important.

-Write it down!
-Okay, geez.

Oh, and never, under any circumstances,

166
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,014
let our parents dress me
in anything with a novelty slogan.

167
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:20,643
You see a "Daddy's Little Monkey" onesie
on me, you rip that filth right off.

168
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,437
Can we not deal
with regular baby stuff right now?

169
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,190
-Any of those go up to the roof?
-Annoyingly, no.

170
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,401
But the boardroom does.
Hatch in the ceiling.

171
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,571
And those elevators are our express line
to the boardroom.

172
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,781
Keep it up, Stace.

173
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:37,201
Does the diversion matter anymore?
The bad guys already know we're here.

174
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:40,121
You know what separates golf pros
from golf amateurs?

175
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:43,207
-Probably good golfing?
-Follow-through.

176
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,120
Templeton, elevator!

177
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,677
You said the hatch to the roof
was up in the boardroom.

178
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,138
The baddies must have realized
we're headed there.

179
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,766
We need to throw them off
and circle back later.

180
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,225
Do we even have a later?

181
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,020
Twenty-nine minutes
till Staci's team tries to chupie in.

182
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:49,732
According to my expensive watch,
which should be held in trust till I can--

183
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,526
Enough regular baby stuff! Focus.

184
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,614
All clear.

185
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:59,617
Like my flawless baby skin.

186
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,287
I wanna kiss myself,
but my lips can't reach.

187
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,332
How long were you waiting
to deliver that comeback?

188
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:09,418
I also workshopped responses
for "No sign of them"

189
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,629
and "It's quiet, too quiet."

190
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,881
Go ahead, feed me another setup.

191
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:21,847
Allez!

192
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,226
Dondre, you got away.

193
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,144
-Now, it's two against--
-Non!

194
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:30,231
This executive dining room
is a holy temple of cuisine,

195
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,858
not a sweaty cage of punchy-slap-kick.

196
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,279
Non!

197
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,993
Now we eat, like civilized creatures.

198
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:44,703
Sorry. I got lost.

199
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,665
-Ow!
-Never arrive late for a meal.

200
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,925
You know you're not walking
out of here a free baby, right?

201
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,602
Idea.

202
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,815
-Boss Baby gives himself up.
-Great plan!

203
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:16,569
I wrote up the terms of surrender
while I was saying this sentence out loud.

204
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,658
Ah, come on, BB.
It's what everybody wants.

205
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:26,036
PuppyCo gets rid
of their most hated enemy...

206
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:31,500
We takes this lovely office space
for our new telly studio.

207
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,544
And me? Promotion!

208
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,297
Baby Corp's new CEO.

209
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,550
Of course I will relocate the company
to some island country

210
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:44,180
with favorable tax rates
and no laws against baby plastic surgery.

211
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,266
What? Thinking of getting a sixth dimple.

212
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:51,187
Cheek, cheek, chin, butt, butt, mystery.

213
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:58,068
For monsieur, la banane congelée.
Flash-frozen for the sensitive baby gums.

214
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,866
I am cutting a tooth right now.

215
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,619
And this? Bit of heaven.

216
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:12,041
What are we thinking on surrender?
Yes? Is it a yes?

217
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,126
Take your time. You're not going anywhere.

218
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,796
Shame. Could have saved you all
a ton of time and hassle.

219
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,965
I am leaving Baby Corp.

220
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,885
But you go first.

221
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:28,098
Mate, for a business bloke,
you are rubbish wif numbers.

222
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:32,144
Our team, small army
with teleportation, versus what?

223
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:36,649
You, Beanstalk Magoof?
Frenchy, you gettin' a piece of this?

224
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:40,361
I have told you, I will not fight
in my own culinary sanctum.

225
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,278
Cool.

226
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:46,617
Because I have already given Boss Baby
everything he needs.

227
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,833
-No!
-Yeah!

228
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,385
He's headed for the roof! Race you there?

229
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,720
I'll crab walk
and say the alphabet backwards.

230
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,807
Z, Y, X, W, V, U, T...

231
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,142
I'll take the hatch in the boardroom
and meet you.

232
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,143
Eight minutes.

233
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,064
Vive la Baby Corp.

234
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,860
[Staci] Look for anything out of place--

235
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,905
a contraption, a whatchamadoo,
possibly a...

236
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,156
Thingerybob.

237
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,286
...D-C-B-A!

238
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,585
Templeton!

239
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,088
Roof hatch... Where...?

240
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,301
[dog barking]

241
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:59,189
I'm sorry. You're dogs in chairs
with your little legs sticking out.

242
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,453
Templeton?

243
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,758
Templeton!

244
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,055
Just go break the jamming thing.
I will be there.

245
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:44,360
Hi, baby! Who wants to play keep-away?

246
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,410
[Boss Baby] One hour, on the dot.

247
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,955
[Tim] I will be there.

248
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:09,885
Now!

249
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,555
Wow!

250
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,016
What?

251
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,400
Come on, Templeton.

252
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,863
Hey, dogs, what did the chicken
say to the egg?

253
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,534
Hatch!

254
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,285
[Boss Baby screaming]

255
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,128
-Told you I'd be there.
-You're counting that?

256
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:48,298
Yo, Boss!
We gonna take care of these yahoos?

257
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,717
Hendershot?

258
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,429
Chupies reprogrammed. Slap 'em in.

259
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,226
[prisoner] Well, well, well.

260
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:03,689
If it ain't them children's entertainers
what finks they look tougher

261
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:06,775
wif rubbish East London accents.

262
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,111
Mr. Pyg and Mr. Tam
say it was all their idea

263
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,114
and you should do your prison violence
on them instead of me.

264
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,366
Thank you, very noble.

265
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,875
[OCB]
That is a leather diaper, you animals!

266
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,002
I love it here!

267
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,766
-Boss, look!
-[female reporter] "Sparklebabies."

268
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:43,520
The new adorable phenomenon that makes
the last one look like gutter puke.

269
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,980
Was it an optical illusion?

270
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:49,276
We may never know, but Channel Eight News
promises our viewers this--

271
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:54,823
we are gonna run these clips on loop
until the "awws" run dry.

272
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,534
-[woman] Love 'em!
-Throw it up on the board.

273
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:11,090
-Yellow 100.
-Yellow 100.

274
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:23,143
Oh, man, somebody trained their pet ferret
to surf, and it is cute as heck.

275
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,603
Staci, prep the field team.

276
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,064
Hendershot, I want
exact coordinates in 20 seconds.

277
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,358
If we let that ferret get a toehold...

278
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,237
What?

279
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,033
It's time to let go.

280
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,868
But the ferret! Baby love!

281
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,956
There's always gonna be a ferret,
or a hamster, or just... whatever.

282
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,584
You said yourself you didn't want to deal
with regular baby stuff.

283
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,130
Can't we just stay like this?

284
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:55,717
I wish we could,
because I'm gonna miss you so much.

285
00:18:57,052 --> 00:19:00,055
But we're still brothers, forever.

286
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,348
I will be there.

287
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:04,226
Last time you said that,
I ended up plummeting off a building.

288
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,563
And I caught you.
I didn't say I know how I'll be there.

289
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,115
I don't know what happens next.

290
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,367
Yeah, but it could be great.

291
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,831
Just give me a day to plan
my retirement party.

292
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:29,084
You're planning a party for yourself?
You know that's weird.

293
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,253
One day. Trust me.

294
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,349
Your favorite tie clip?

295
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,893
It'll look better on you.

296
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,895
Gonna miss you, Beebs.

297
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,112
"I don't do mornings."

298
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,449
That's never getting old.

299
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,785
"Thou shalt not steal"?
Well, that can't be right.

300
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,256
-Close enough.
-Never change, big guy.

301
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,928
Sir, you don't have to do--

302
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,179
Just open it.

303
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:30,062
You don't need anything from anyone.
You're ready for this.

304
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,361
The board will make it official on Monday.

305
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,449
Thank you, sir.

306
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,952
Thank you, boss.

307
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,834
Templeton, I gotta be honest, I think
I gave your present to someone else.

308
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,461
I'm good.

309
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,300
Well, that's the last
of the special formula.

310
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,594
Change should be coming any minute.

311
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:06,473
You really gonna watch me turn into
regular baby Theodore Lindsey Templeton?

312
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:09,142
What if I shove a raisin up my nostril?

313
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,728
-I'll be here.
-Your call.

314
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,273
I thought you got rid of your monitor.

315
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,735
-Tim?
-Danny?

316
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:23,198
Some weird baby in a suit handed me
a gift box with this thing and a note--

317
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,492
"Press button for bro jam."

318
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,042
-Thanks.
-[Danny] We gonna do this?

319
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,920
I made a few revisions since last time.
I hope that's cool.

320
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,381
Yeah. Things change.

321
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,010
