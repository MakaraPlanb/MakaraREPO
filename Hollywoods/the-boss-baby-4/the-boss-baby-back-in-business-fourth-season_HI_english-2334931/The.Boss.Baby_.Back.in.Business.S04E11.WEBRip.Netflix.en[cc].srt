Long story, but the short version
is Baby Corp got scattered

One day everyone may get scattered by
technologic sabotage,

69

and you won't be able to tell them
everything you should've,

70
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,091
and it'll be all your fault
because you failed them as a leader!

71
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,261
Or your friend could move away, same diff.

72
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,847
-We got this, Templeton.
-You're sure? Because--

73

I'm sure. Go make some memories.

Tomorrow could be too late!

now that they have our office.

We ordered pizza tacos
and he called us sir! I feel like a king.

169
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,312
Quartered grapes on grahams!

170
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:27,483
Mmm. Delicate! Decadent! Dondre!

171
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,322
-Ah, Boss Baby!
-Impressive work.

172
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,950
-I don't know how you do it.
-Thank you!

173
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:40,621
I sneak into the kitchen late at night
and prepare the most wonderful desserts.

174
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,498
Look at the joy I bring people.

175
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,834
We could use those dishes back
at Baby Corp.

176
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:45,751
Come on. Let's go.

177
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,546
Baby Corp? What I am but a servant?

178
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:52,633
Did you see my review in the paper?
Here I am a genius!

179
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,844
You are! But we need you back.

180
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:59,223
There comes a thing to... Babies need...

181
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,475
[Ted] Uh, hold up. Um...

182
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,769
I am happy here.

183
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,439
Understood.

184
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,608
-Woah!
-Woah!

185
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:09,900
-Woah!
-Woah!

186
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,152
Woah!

187
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,571
[overlapping dialogue]

188
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,407
Hey, hey, hey, welcome back, everyone!
Good work.

189
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,826
I found an intern in a big mailbox!

190
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,954
I found three of them
jammed in a tube slide!

191
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,373
-How did you do, Boss?
-Failed.

192
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:27,710
Par for the course
at Boss Baby Pines Country Club.

193
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:31,422
Throw him an easy one, man.
He just needs a shot at victory.

194
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,301
Yo, Double-B, police report
two possible tiny trespassers

195
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,219
at the old Bubbeezee headquarters.

196
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,514
Oh, yeah? I'd bet my salary
that's Frankie and Simmons.

197
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,059
Peg and Chip!

198
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,604
-Boss!
-So happy you're okay!

199
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:51,400
-What a thing with the chupies, huh?
-I zapped into a fisherman's gut bucket!

200
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,695
Come on. Let's go.
We're getting the team back together.

201
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,239
-We're good.
-Yeah. We'd rather stay here.

202
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:01,952
-Uh... This is an empty office.
-I know! It's so quiet here.

203
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,539
No co-worker drama,
definitely no puppies and preeks.

204
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:09,001
-We're going to take care of all that.
-How?

205
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,128
With the power of...

206
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,756
[sighs]

207
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,762
I can't believe the window washers
are letting us do this!

208
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:22,932
Dump it!

209
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,811
And... go!

210
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,192
How many have you brought back? Be honest.

211
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,611
Let's just say more than some?

212
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,571
[yowls]

213
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:41,492
But don't worry about it!
You'll bring back 20 babies next time!

214
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,328
Looks like there's a new mannequin
at Junior Fancy's.

215
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,208
Hello, good sir.

216
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,627
My friend and I would like
to try on five suits.

217
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,754
[both] At the same time!

218
00:11:56,132 --> 00:12:00,302
-Come on, Amal! Please come with me?
-Don't blow my cover!

219
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,893
So, to be clear,
you would rather stand still forever

220
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,937
than help me take back Baby Corp?

221
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,440
There's a comfort in letting go.

222
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,234
[sighs]
Godspeed, Amal.

223
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,903
Or, I guess, God-stand-still.

224
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,449
This is truly one of the greatest things
we've ever done.

225
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,868
Dad! Come back?

226
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:29,874
No, I'm going to stick with the old raft.
It feels like a vacation.

227
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,083
[Ted sighs]

228
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,795
So, you're staying? Here? As a dog?

229
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,672
-[imitates dog] Bark, bark, bark.
-[yells]

230
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,301
I'm just a diggety doggity,
and my name is Bicycle the dog.

231
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,261
-[boy imitates dog] Arf, arf, arf.
-[sighs]

232
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,182
Aw, man.

233
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,978
Taking a break
from all the baby retrieving?

234
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,981
All the employees are scared.

235
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:57,234
It'd be hard for anyone
to coax them back to Baby Corp.

236
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,946
-Psst. We all clear, Stace?
-Yeah. Go ahead.

237
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,245
Fine. You're not at your best right now.

238
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,832
Neither was I after that Small Pocks
diaper marketing disaster.

239
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,542
But who brought me back?

240
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,295
Somebody a lot better at the job
than I am right now.

241
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,963
You're still the same you.

242
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,549
You've just got some dumb nugget
in your brain

243
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,760
blocking the genius from coming through.

244
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:25,012
What's it gonna take
to knock that nugget out?

245
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,307
Divine intervention? Ah! What?

246
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,935
This is a sign.

247
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:36,023
That you should help us.
Because we are stuck in a tree.

248
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,736
[both giggles]

249
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,363
-[clatters]
-Oh!

250
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,200
Well, I feel ready to write
an epic bro-jam for the ages.

251
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:51,997
No. There's one more thing we must do...
the airing of the beefs.

252
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,626
For our friendship to survive,
we must hash out our disagreements.

253
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:59,338
We must light a candle to the farts
we have unleashed upon each other!

254
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,965
You sure this is a good idea?

255
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,218
What if wind up even madder at each other
than we were when we got mad?

256
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,596
Exactly why I've assembled
a panel of impartial judges.

257
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,224
To the community center to air the beefs!

258
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,392
[farts]

259
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,893
[laughs]

260
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:13,936
What was that?

261
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,814
Ah. I was hoping it'd be beefier,
for effect.

262
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,441
Kind of surprised to see you all, sir.

263
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:23,195
I assumed the board would be
in some executive panic room bunker.

264
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:29,994
And we were, until Hermano Menor got
lured out with a duckie toy on a string.

265
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:34,248
And the duckie looked so fun and friendly!
I figured we must be safe.

266
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:39,086
Out he goes, in come our enemies,
and, well, here we are.

267
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,797
Bright side: the bad guys
let me keep the duckie.

268
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,718
Am I embarrassed? Yes.
But what can you do?

269
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,012
Hermano Menor is my brother,

270
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:51,140
and there is no shame
in sticking by your family.

271
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,433
[sighs]

272
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,144
This entire thing happened
because I put helping my brother

273
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,854
before protecting Baby Corp.

274
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,399
I know. Why do you think
I'm telling you this story?

275
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:05,029
It's an illustrative example
meant to apply to your situation.

276
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:06,906
You guys got that, right?

277
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,325
-Completely!
-Totally. Makes sense.

278
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,785
Um... Your Majesty, or whatever,

279
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,663
wonder if you could put
a little more mustard on that.

280
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:17,166
-BB's really in a funk.
-Staci!

281
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,628
Like, tell him he's the greatest CEO
of all time or something.

282
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:25,549
-Well, now it's not going to be sincere.
-But, Staci, I already did.

283
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:30,262
Baby love fuels Baby Corp,
but family love creates baby love.

284
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:34,475
Boss Baby is a master of both.
He makes both stronger.

285
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,603
Um, could you just say the thing Staci?

286
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,857
You are the greatest CEO of all time.

287
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:46,195
Yes! Let's save Baby Corp!

288
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,529
[clears throat]

289
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:52,034
Myself, Midge Marksberry, and Officer Doug
will help air the beefs

290
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:56,997
standing in the way of eternal friendship
between Mr. Petrosky and Mr. Templeton.

291
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:01,001
-Now, who would like to go first?
-You have to call on one of us.

292
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,796
We need this process to be
as impartial as possible.

293
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:07,383
[indistinct chattering]

294
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,885
We choose the Templeton boy.

295
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,428
Okay.

296
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:12,805
[sighs]

297
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,224
Danny, when we were in preschool,

298
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,559
you ripped
my "Biggest Little Froggy" book.

299
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,354
-You told me to!
-Why would I do that?

300
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:23,983
-You handed it to me and said "rip it."
-Stop lying and apologize!

301
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:28,529
Can we talk about how this one
pasted my shoe onto my face?

302
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:31,323
-That was an accident.
-How can that be an accident?

303
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,451
By me accidentally pasting
a shoe to your face.

304
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,747
Let me tell you
what Baby Corp means to me.

305
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,834
It's not just a workplace. It's a family.

306
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,963
And no one in a family should go
without feeling appreciated.

307
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,589
So, thank you, Dondre.

308
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,592
The extravagance you bring
to your executive dining room

309
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,512
inspires babies to rise to the top.

310
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,181
I will follow you, Boss Baby,

311
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,977
but only because this dessert
has been destroyed by my joyful tear.

312
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,812
I will take that as a win.

313
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,273
I will never talk to you again!

314
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:08,235
I didn't steal
your grandfather's steelie shooter marble!

315
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,071
Well, I did steal
your remote control snake.

316
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,782
I know!
So I ripped that "Number One Ragamuffin"

317
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:14,950
patch off your jacket.

318
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,162
That's why I stole your shoes
with sweet pockets in them.

319
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,789
Now you know why I took
the candy your dad brought you

320
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,375
from the vending machine
at the military base in the Earth's core!

321
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,878
Shh! Not around the government!

322
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,676
Tension, anxiety, unpredictability.

323
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,971
Am I talking about a workplace
or a family? I don't know!

324
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,141
But what I do know is that
without your ruthlessness, Chip,

325
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:43,353
and without your tenacity, Peg,
we will never take back our home.

326
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,940
The Baby Corp family needs you.
To victory!

327
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:51,195
Who gets dibs
on an entire bucket of chicken?

328
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,531
Someone trying to enjoy life
to the fullest!

329
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:58,243
-Boys! We feel--
-Let's get back to my steelie shooter.

330
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,453
I didn't steal it!

331
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:02,372
-Do you want our friendship to fail?
-Of course not.

332
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:06,502
Then why won't you admit you stole
my steel marble family heirloom?

333
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:11,548
Because I didn't steal it! I swallowed it.

334
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,800
[all gaps]

335
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,843
Why wouldn't you just tell me?

336
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,971
I thought I could use the marble
to see the back of my teeth

337
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,724
after you said there were little
green critters that lived back there.

338
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:21,892
I stand by that.

339
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,521
Well, I lost my grip on the marble
and it slid down my throat.

340
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,814
I almost died!

341
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:30,901
And a few days later, it came out
from the other end, into the toilet.

342
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:34,196
I was too embarrassed
and way too grossed out to fish for it.

343
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,282
I'm sorry for not telling you the truth
about pooping your marble.

344
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,247
I forgive you.

345
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:48,043
I hereby declare
all beefs successfully aired.

346
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,837
Let friendship ring!

347
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,588
Epic bro-jam!

348
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,508
Oh!

349
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,512
[all laugh]

350
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,515
-Oh, look at that baby!
-Aw. My-- Ho, ho!

351
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:12,109
I could give you
a big inspirational speech, or...

352
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,068
[sniffs]

353
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:14,903
Bark, bark, bark!

354
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,698
-[boy imitates dog] Arf!
-He says he'll come back!

355
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,283
[imitates dog] Woof!

356
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,661
But he still has
some doggy business first?

357
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:25,372
-Bark, bark, bark!
-What's that, boy? You found Jimbo?

358
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,915
What? Is that true?

359
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,795
[sniffs]
Woof!

360
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,882
-Jimbo!
-Boss! Get me out of here!

361
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,301
You've become a legend, Jimbo!
[groans]

362
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,761
-They're calling you the Cookiecabra.
-[gasps]

363
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,139
-I've never been legendary before!
-[groans]

364
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,599
Is everyone else okay?

365
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,351
Safe in my family's basement.

366
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,437
-[groans]
-[imitates dog] Bark, bark, bark...

367
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,734
You always wanted to be a dog!
[giggles]

368
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,152
I'm so proud!

369
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,154
[all groan]

370
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:02,075
-It's no use. I need a big kid.
-I'll wait here!

371
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,914
That's the most epic bro-jam chord
I've ever heard!

372
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,166
-Wait until you hear the next one!
-[Ted babbling]

373
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,710
Uh. Just a sec.

374
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:13,837
I need your help.

375
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,131
But Danny and I are finally writing
our epic bro-jam.

376
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,174
Three minutes.

377
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,508
[sighs]

378
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,678
I got to help my brother.
I'll see you in three minutes.

379
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,223
You'll see me in two and a half.

380
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,851
Because you're taking Thunder Dumpling.

381
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,860
-There you go.
-Ooh!

382
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:41,073
Thank you, Tim! Thank you, Boss!
You're the best, Boss.

383
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:44,785
For some reason, hearing that from you
makes me finally believe it.

384
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,705
Gotta get back to Danny, you guys
have fun, I can help tomorrow, bye!

385
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,416
Danny?

386
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,549
[Danny] "Dearest Timothy,
due to reports of the Cookiecabra,

387
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,677
a harbinger of government scientists,

388
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,096
my dad had to pull us out of here, stat.

389
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,641
I miss you already, buddy.
Take care of Thunder Dumpling.

390
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:08,934
She's yours now.

391
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,813
Heart, heart. Skull.
Flaming guitar. Danny."

392
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,482
[car engine starts]

393
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:19,736
[dramatic music]

394
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,549
I'm... so sorry.

395
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,095
I just wanted us to be able
to say goodbye the way we wanted to.

396
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,263
I get that.

397
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:50,976
Can I show you something
that might cheer you up just a little?

398
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:56,940
-[overlapping dialogue]
-Woah. Is that everyone?

399
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,525
They all came back.

400
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:03,405
Babies of Baby Corp, you may have noticed
I haven't been at my best.

401
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,990
Heck, I've been a mess!

402
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,451
But this experience
has made me realize something.

403
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:11,121
I'm no longer the right leader
for this company.

404
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,749
I'm retiring from Baby Corp.

405
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,001
-Retiring?
-Aah! Do not say those words!

406
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,377
Not right now!

407
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:21,256
What am I going to keep you all in
my parents' basement gathering dust? No!

408
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,801
When I say goodbye, I'm going
to say goodbye the way I want to.

409
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,472
We're going to take back Baby Corp.

410
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,683
And we're going to hit
that beautiful Yellow 100.

411
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,019
Are you with me, babies?

412
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:38,231
-[all cheer]
-Shh! My parents are upstairs!

413
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:41,443
[all cheering weakly]
