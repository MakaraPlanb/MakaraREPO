[Boss Baby] Hoot! Hoot!

Hoot! Hoot!

P-P-P-Pants, take a memo.

00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,311
Hoot! Hoot!
Stuff the eggs in the pancake-pancake.

Hoot! Hoot!
St-St-Stuff the eggs in the pancake

-[laughs] I love songs with hooting!
-[Boss Baby] Simmons!

23
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,236
-Agh! What?!
-Yeah, sorry to startle you.

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,615
Not sure if you heard about my recent
crazy, over-tired late-night dialing.

25
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:16,034
Uh... doesn't sound familiar.

-Eh--

-Owl Channel.

-[bangs]
-What do you need? [chuckles nervously]

30
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,753
Something to impress
the Board of Directors.

31
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,129
What kind of something?

32
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:33,134
Something that screams,
"Massive Yellow 100 win for Baby Love!"

33
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,594
Then gently whispers,

34
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,263
"Let's forget Boss Baby's
sleep-deprived incident."

35
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,225
I'm thinking... invention something?

36
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,268
Ah, I got just the thing.

37
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,563
It's still a work in progress, but... yeh!

38
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:47,982
A diaper?

39
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,693
A 24-hour diaper.

40
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,614
Twenty-four hours? Fronts and butts?

41
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,491
Fronts and butts.

42
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:57,951
Twenty-four-hour diaper!

43
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,495
Can you imagine what this could do
for Baby Love?!

44
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,996
Yes. I can.

45
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,582

It isn't just a game changer...

00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,809
-it's a life changer!
-[Simmons] Yes.

52
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,853
I-I told you it's a work in progress!

53
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,896
We need to run field tests!

54
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,315
And we will. But for now,

55
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,986
put on your Board-wowing face
and let's show 'em what you got.

00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:37,782
-Board babies! How are we do--
-[laughter, applauding]

00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,576

you are killin' in it.

00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,920

and he won't stop thanking me.

62
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,131
-[Board Baby] Wonderful anecdote!
-[Board Baby 2] Nice!

63
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,341
Boss Baby! Excellent!

64
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,678
We were hoping to introduce you to OCB.

65
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,847
"Plemu."
Short for "pleased to meet you."

66
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,099
Full sentences-- waste of time.

67
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,810
Time needed to help this company.

68
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,021
Pleasure. Incredible dimples.

69
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,397
Uh-huh, they are.

70
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,483
Now, when you say,
"help this company," what exactly--

71
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,611
[gasps] Bad ideas...

72
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,279
brief, jargon-filled sentences...

73
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:19,407
dazzling smile that blinds others
to a complete lack of substance--

74
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,702
Ugh! You're a consultant!

75
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,830
Our new Outside Consultant Baby!

76
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,249

[forced laughter]

82
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,136
[whispers] Say nothing
in front of the consultant. Trust me.

83
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,096
Your Boardly Eminences!

84
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,641
Do we really need an outside consultant?

85
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,352
Yes. That advice? Free.

86
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:51,147
Rest is gonna cost you. I'm worth it!
[laughs]

87
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,191
I am fully on top of things--

88
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:56,903
Eggs in the pancake.
And you eat it like a taco. Hoot! Hoot!

89
00:03:56,986 --> 00:04:00,782
Sorry! I was watching that earlier.
It makes me feel better about my life.

90
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:04,202
OCB is our gift to you, Boss Baby.

91
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,788
Would you reject a generous offer of help?

92
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,414
No, I-- [chuckles]

93
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:12,085
Of course, I love help. But a consultant?

94
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,504
They're classic "seagull managers."

95
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,798
Swoop into the office,
making a bunch of noise

96
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,591
about everything we're doing wrong.

97
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,761
"Squawk! That's a problem!
Squawk! That's a problem!"

98
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:25,306
Then they poop out
a bunch of ridiculous new ideas

99
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,352
and fly off, leaving everyone else
to clean up their mess.

100
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,521
So, you don't like new ideas?

101
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,648
[stammers]
N-No, th-that's not what I'm saying!

102
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,067
Idea-- cupcake party for morale.

103
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,735
Ooh! I love that!

104
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,488
I've done that! This is nonsense!

105
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,073
You know what else
they called "nonsense"?

106
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:45,535
The wheel. Boats. Tennis.
Lunch meat. Horses.

107
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,579
Nonsense is the garden.
Gardens grow ideas.

108
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,123
Watch-- slash-- learn.

109
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,833

110
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,836
Stay-cation days! Pow!
Nonsense? Ideas.

111
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,504
Watch me do it again. [babbling]

112
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:01,009
Engraved crayons!
Crayon mix-ups? No more.

113
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,261
[babbling] A new suit!

114
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,888
[babbling] Uh, more stock options!

115
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,434
Gobbledy-goo. I, too, have an idea.

116
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:12,770
Boss Baby, why don't you take OCB
on a company tour?

117
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,190
Let him see everything
he can help us with.

118
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,900
Of course.

119
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,445
Just give me a few
to get everything ready.

120
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:21,529
[clicking]

121
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:26,367
[Staci groans]
Consulting babies are the worst!

122
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,619
Ugh! I couldn't even make my big play!

123
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,913
If that triple-dimpled showboat
got even a hint

124
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,707
of Simmons' 24-hour diaper,

125
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,959
he'd ruin it with his own dumb ideas!

126
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:35,960
Or worse!

127
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:39,839
He'd drop us in the middle of the woods
and take us down one by one.

128
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,717
What is it you think
a consultant baby does?

129
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,427
Hunts other babies for sport?

130
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,345
Hmm. That's actually not far off.

131
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,474
And that's why you're taking Simmons
and these diapers off the grid.

132
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,018
Oh! Sorry. You can take that out now.

133
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,603
[coughs]

134
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,439
Huh. I've been drooling on this
for a half hour.

135
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,317
-Feel it. Come on, feel it!
-[muffled grunt]

136
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:04,113
Whoa. Dry as a bone!
This thing's gonna kill.

137
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,908
Simmons says it needs field testing,
so help her test it.

138
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:07,992
Me?

139
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,827
Get it ready to hit the market.

140
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,371
OCB can't ruin our 24-hour diaper

141
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,540
if it's already sitting on shelves.

142
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,585
Don't you think my skills
are better suited to,

143
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,712
you know, consult the consultant?

144
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,632
Drop him in the woods and hunt him.

145
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,759
I'll handle OCB.

146
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,178
You find a black-ops site
where you can work in secret.

147
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,431
Twenty-four-hour diaper!
Bring it home, compadres!

148
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,391
-[door closes]
-"Bring it home"...?

149
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,062
[gasps] Simmons,
I just got our black-ops site.

150
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,732
-The Templeton basement!
-Uh, I don't see it.

-[monitor beeps]
-Triplets! On me!

152
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:47,240
[clatters]

153
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,574
[whirring]

154
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,498
[Staci] Not a bad place
to test an invention, huh?

155
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,041
-Someone say "invention"?
-[babies gasp]

156
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,709
How'd you bypass security?

157
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,962
I've been here the whole time.
It's my house.

158
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,296
Now, what's the invention?

159
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,049
Cold fire? Hot ice? Meat gum?

160
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,260
Uh, we're making 24-hour diapers!

161
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:09,262
Cool!

162
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,223
Time to get these butt-snuggers
ready for market.

163
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:15,685
Simmons, you're on testing--
volume, durability.

164
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:16,936
Triplets.

165
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,188
We need a better name
than "24-Hour Diapers."

166
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,440
Get on it!

167
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,692
And Tim, wrangle some babies.

168
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,196
So, "wrangle."

169
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,073
You know how you can hear a word
all your life

170
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,867
but not know what it actually means?

171
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,327
Just bring me some stinkin' babies!

172
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:39,083
We're all systems go, BB.
You TCOB with OCB yet?

173
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,919
ASAP. Right after I give him the tour.

174
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,464
-You're actually doing that?
-Of course!

175
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,007
That's how I get rid of him.

176
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,509
Consultants can't consult
if there's nothing to fix.

177
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,637
So, I just show OCB a company
that has no problems.

178
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,890
Also, I brought in Jimbo
to intimidate him.

179
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,477
-Can I give you some advice?
-[snaps] No!

180
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,103
Yeah, cool, you got your thing.

181
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,396
Tour time!

182
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:05,735
With increased employment,
we've had to up our formula production.

183
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,279
Oof! Sky-high bottle costs.

184
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:11,991
Not if you come up with a recycling system
to cut those very costs.

185
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,117
[slurps]

186
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,250
Which I did.

187
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,091
This pudding? Killer. But every baby knows

188
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,469
-that the best pudding comes from--
-Baby Corp Stockholm?

189
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,888
Yeah. That's why I have
a shipment flown in every week

190
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,306
for my employees' enjoyment.

191
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,892
-Eh. Yikes on that snacktime budge!
-[pen clicks]

192
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,645
Which is why I pay for it myself.

193
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:42,980
[clicks]

194
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,815
I respect the hustle, kid,

195
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,277
but as you've probably deduced,
there's nothing here to consult.

196
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,905
Never the case. Cubicle square footage?

197
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,157
Thirty-six. Double the national average.

198
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:56,077
-Executive parking spaces?
-Zero. No one drives.

199
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,578
Boss-employee relationship?

200
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,163
Chip? How's that twisted ankle?

201
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,290
[Chip] Much better! Thanks for the splint!

202
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,376
No problem, Chip, my boy.

203
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,253
No problem at all.

204
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:07,463
[clatters]

205
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,758
Major props, BB. You run a tight ship.

206
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,134
Sorry. [chuckles] I missed that.

207
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,555
Would you mind repeating yourself
in a few minutes and in a different room?

208
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,557
Boss Baby runs a tight ship.

209
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,850
Every statistic-- nails it.

210
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,228
Every department-- overseen to a T.

211
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:26,732
Simply put, Boss Baby?
Company's greatest asset.

212
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,863
Caveat-- also, the most dangerous.

213
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,865
[gasps] Misleading nod!

214
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,659
Assessment time.

215
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:40,705
Boss Baby-- micro-manager.
Stifling employees.

216
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:43,165
I don't stifle employees.
They love me!

217
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,293
But are they growing?
[mimics buzzer] Enh!

218
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,753
-And when babies don't grow...
-[vase clatters]

219
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,840
company don't show... results.

220
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:51,841
Whuh-oh!

221
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,843
Baby Corp-- poof!

222
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,595
Bottom line, bank it.

223
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,389
-[all gasp]
-Oh, no! We cannot have that.

224
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,474
He's blinding you
with his efficiency-speak

225
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,018
and stunning baby good looks!

226
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,854
OCB, what would you consult us to do?

227
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,939
[babbling]

228
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:07,857
Idea!

229
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,236
Make this guy stay in his office all day.

230
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,154
What?

231
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:16,532
Does Baby Corp thrive without Boss Baby?

232
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,869
I think it will, but let's find out.

233
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,622
Unh! That is consulting!

234
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,625
I am handsome and starving!

235
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,460
You babies got an executive dining room?

236
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:28,586
Excellent idea!

237
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,379
-[Board Baby] Great work!
-[Board Baby 2] Yes! Yes!

238
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:34,884
Test site prepped. Send me... Brayden.

239
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,595
Look at that Templeton boy
taking his afternoon

240
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,680
to play hide-and-seek with the babies.

241
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,182
So sweet.

242
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:42,808
-[whines]
-[pops]

243
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:48,564
Thanks for being a part of this study
that never happened.

244
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,857
[cooing]

245
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,568
Exactly Brayden. "What study?"

246
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,445
Twenty-four-hour diaper.

247
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:55,738
-Test one. Load.

[spurts]

251
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,333
It's holding.

252
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,585
[taps]

253
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,921

-Test two. Durability.

[thumps]

255
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,216
It's holding!

256
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,094
[Simmons] Test five. Heavy load.

257
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:19,428

It's holding!

261
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,479
[Simmons grunts] Test nine. Elasticity.

00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,272
-[reel whirring]
-[Staci] It's holding!

263

-[Simmons] Test eleven. Extreme load.
-[Brayden spurts, coos]

264
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,778
Still holding!

265
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,571
[Simmons] Test 31...

266
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,823
Test 52...

267
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,199
Test 74!

[flatulence spurts]

271
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,039
World-record load! Check.

272
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,541
[chuckles] Oh, boy!

273
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:51,001
-All tests complete!
-Nice.

274
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,003
Now, let's get that off him before it--
[gasps]

275
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,756
-[popping]
-Gah! Gah! Gah!

276
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,341
[gasping]

277
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,052
-Jimbo, more balloons.

-Stupid! Handsome! Consultant!

280
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,891
-[Jimbo whimpering]
-[sighs] Thank you.

281
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:09,895
OCB convinces the Board
to lock me up in my office all day?

282
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,398
I don't like it. What's his angle?

283
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:16,569
-Jimbo!
-Sorry. I ballooned myself woozy.

284
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:20,156
You should eat. I'll order you something
from the executive dining room. [gasps]

285
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,657
Executive dining room!

286
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:22,950
[munching]

287
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,994
Surely, monsieur did not bring me here

288
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,538
simply to watch the big one
enjoy the nummy-nums?

289
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,165
No, I brought you here

290
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,668
because I need information
on OCB's schemes.

291
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:36,630
And I happen to know he ate
in your dining room today. Ahem.

292
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,886
I am a maître d', which means I value
class and, most of all, discretion.

293
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,221
There's always something to value more.

294
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,265
I need info. Name your price.

295
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:52,313
Sometimes, a life of service
can be without rewards.

296
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,732
Here comes the airplane.

297
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,610
No, no! With gumption.
And more French!

298
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:58,986
What does that mea--

299
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,279
[in French] Mon bébé cherie.

300
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,865
-[coos] Ah!
-Regarde a le petit avion

301
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:06,243
qui amène la purée
dans ton adorable bouche.

302
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,871
-Vive la France!
-[gulps] Delicious.

303
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,749
-[in French] De rien.
-And now, dessert.

304
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,626
Seriously?!
We just fed you like--

305
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,545
Oh-hh, it's a metaphor.
The dessert is information. Proceed.

306
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,422
Please, scoot back.

307
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,383
You are about to be thrust
to the edge of your high chairs.

308
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:25,971
For you see, OCB has been
slow-roasting his plans...

309
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:30,226
and at lunch, he served them
piping-hot and steaming.

310
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,685
So, what are we noshing on?

311
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,939
Today, we have the wiggly noodles.

312
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,942
And may I recommend the splash sauce?

313
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,527
Oh, you may indeed.

314
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:43,989
That Boss Baby, huh?
Can't delegate. Doesn't listen.

315
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:47,743
And a CEO with a temper like that?
Seriously?

316
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,161
Best CEOs--

317
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,455
dapper, charming, cool.

318
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:52,831
Just like you!

319
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:56,877
All's I'm sayin', I worry for him.
For Baby Corp.

320
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,213
You are a noble businessman.

321
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,298
[babbling] Idea--

322
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,803
Baby Corp gets a new CEO.

323
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,222
It's out there, we all heard it.

324
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,140
Enjoy lunch. Talk later.

325
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:14,228
[gasps] He's not a seagull manager,
he's a bird of prey!

326
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,313
And he's hunting my job!

327
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,649
Uh-uh! Where are you going?

328
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,569
I need to see the Board.
Why are you outside my office?

329
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:22,861
OCB sent me.

330
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,281
He said the Board said you're not supposed
to leave your office

331
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,824
so that other employees can grow.

332
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,325
And if you do leave your office,

333
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,871
it just proves you're a terrible CEO
who doesn't want them to.

334
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,290
-What?!
-I am not repeating that!

335
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,916
[groans] Gah-hh!

336
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,877
He's got me boxed in!

337
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,545
We need a trick up our sleeves!

338
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,839
[scoffs] I don't even have sleeves!

339
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,424
[gasps] Diaper!

340
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,968
It's looking real good, Staci!

341
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,928
Triplets. Where are we on a name?

342
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,848
This is more than just a 24-hour diaper.

343
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,475
This is the 24-hour diaper.

344
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,144
And that's why we call it...

345
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,689
"The 24-Hour Diaper."

346
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,858
That's the name we gave you!

347
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,776
See? Very memorable!

348
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,237
-[groans]
-[monitor chimes]

349
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,906
BB! [nervous chuckle]

350
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,326
OCB's not the dumb handsome consultant
we thought he was!

351
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,869
I never said "handsome."

352
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,038
Happily, there's no way
the Board will replace me

353
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:17,333
once I've delivered
those 24-hour golden poop saddles.

354
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:21,170
[laughs]
OCB's not gonna know what hit him.

355
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,714
-On my way to you now.
-For what?

356
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,634
To carry this project
over the finish line. Gotta move quick.

357
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,803
I am moving quick.
On the job you assigned me.

358
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,889
I know I did, but--

359
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,600
now my job's riding on that diaper, Stace.

360
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:37,227
OCB's up there,
charming the Board against me.

361
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,396
I can't just sit here
doing nothing to stop that!

362
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,149
You did do something. You hired me.

363
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,902
And when that call comes, I will be there.

364
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:48,280
With a diaper
that'll blow their butts off. All right?

365
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:50,991
All right.

366
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,121
-I'm gonna check on her real quick--
-Boss, no!

367
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,456
[grunting]

368
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,959
So, now that this diaper invention's
all done,

369
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,044
let's talk about a little idea I call...

370
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,462
"meat gum."

371
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,381
Done? Not yet.

372
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,384
I know we got ourselves
a solid 24-hour diaper.

373
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,136
But let's paint it red! Give it mufflers!

374
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,764
Take it off the diaper track
and take it global!

375
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,892
Because we're not here
to blow away the competition...

376
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:20,145
we're here to blow away the world.

377
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,231
[all cheering] Yeah!

378
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,067
A 25-hour diaper! [claps]

379
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,070
I'm sure we can think of something
better than that.

380
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,866
Come on! One last push, guys.

381
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,953
I gave a speech! I never give speeches!

382
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,789
-Oh, we tried everything.
-[Tim] Candy!

383
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,541
Candy always gives me ideas.

384
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,085
It also makes me run in circles,
but it mostly gives me ideas.

385
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,880
Here it is-- uh, never mind.
Not that either.

386
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,549
-[wrapper crinkling]
-Oh, gross.

387
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,175
Wait! Yes! Here!

388
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,719
What are those?

389
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:53,804
Pockets?

390
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:57,266
In a diaper for 24 hours?
Exploring? Finding things?

391
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,643
Worms. Ninja stars.
Got a place to put it all?

392
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,186
Well, now you do.

393
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,938
Pockets! [laughs]

394
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,066
Diapers with tiny pockets?
Adorable!

395
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,277
Uh, like this?

396
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,987
See? Adorable!

397
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,572
Perfect!

398
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,365
[Boss Baby grunting]

399
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,284
Ha! [gasps]

400
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,162
-Where's my transport chupie?
-I have hidden it.

401
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,205
Inside a soufflé.

402
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,874
-What?!
-Delicious twist!

403
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:25,294
Do you know why le soufflé
is so difficult to master?

404
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,588
Are you sidetracking
to brag about your cooking

405
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,089
or are we doing the metaphor thing again?

406
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:33,343
The chef must trust le soufflé
to rise without looking.

407
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,554
To be ready without checking.

408
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,015
To be delicious without tasting.

409
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:42,561
This is le soufflé in which
your chupie hides, Boss Baby.

410
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,481
Do you trust that it is... mwah?

411
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:46,815
So, bragging, then?

412
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,985
-Metaphor! Let Staci work!
-[monitor chimes]

413
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:52,946
[Boss Baby] Emiliano!

414
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,323
How are we?

415
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:58,952
The Board and OCB
would like to see you. Immediately.

416
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,582
I'll be right there.

417
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,879
[cheering]

418
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,964
Simmons, call the factory.

419
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,300
Get them the specs
and get them producing.

420
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,511
Triplets, I need you to nail that name.

421
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,930
Come on! You know we're not going to!

422
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,641
I couldn't even tell you
what that guy's name is.

423
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:24,436
Derwin Alphonse Castellagrava.
I thought everybody knew that.

424
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,063
Ugh, fine!

425
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,398
Call Marketing
and make them give you a name.

426
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:31,485
I need this diaper in stores
and homes ASAP!

427
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:36,115
OCB, we understand you have
one final consultation to make?

428
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,784
-Thank you. I--
-Wanna be CEO?

429
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,786
-What?
-That's what you're gonna say, right?

430
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,204
You wanna be CEO.

431
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,456
You want me fired and you want my job.

432
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,083
Well, yeah,

433
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,877
but, like, post-lavish presentation.

434
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,339
Had all these sports metaphors
in the bullpen. So money.

435
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,632
I'm sure.

436
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:57,511
Board Babies, I admit,
OCB's a good salesman.

437
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:01,348
And I'm sure he would make a fine CEO.
But here's the thing.

438
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,683
I'm a better one.

439
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:06,353
Uh, more like a bench warmer
who made a lucky shot or two.

440
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,437
Sports metaphor.

441
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,190
Well, I hope you like the taste
of my soufflé.

442
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,276
Cooking metaphor. Behold!

443
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,284
Full disclosure-- hands-off delegating
makes it really difficult

444
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,577
-to time a dramatic entr--
-[bell pings]

445
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,164
There we go! Behold! A new diaper.

446
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,291
A diaper? That's your Hail Mary?

447
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:30,586
That lasts 24 hours.

448
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,045
Oh, Mary.

449
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:33,839
Your Boardly Eminences.

450
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,258
Please enjoy this commercial
that is currently playing

451
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,843
in every major market.

452
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,344
OCB, please don't enjoy.

453
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,722
[announcer] Do you know what happened

454
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:45,309
after we discovered the 24-hour diaper?

455
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,061
-We threw it out.
-[gasps]

456
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,150
Because we found something even better.

457
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,778
Pockets! Staci, you genius!

458
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,697
How'd you manage all this in one day?

459
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,575
You asked me to deliver. I deliver.

460
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,660
And a full promotional campaign?

461
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,829
Oh, that I didn't have time for.

462
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,664
You can thank Marketing for that one.

463
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,917
Tell me you didn't just say "Marketing."

464
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,462
-[woman in commercial groaning]
-[announcer] The 24-hour diaper.

465
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,839
With baby-sized pockets.

466
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,592
We call it "Small Pocks"!

467
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,844
Get your Small Pocks today.

468
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,096
-They're called Small Pocks!
-[ball horn honks]

469
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,890
Small Pocks!

470
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,016
Oh, no!

471
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,477
How could you agree to that name?

472
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,189
Because... it's short for "small pockets"?

473
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:35,400
And also happens to be the name
of a blister-raising infectious disease

474
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,445
that ravaged every continent in the world
until a vaccine was developed?

475
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:42,241
-[buzzing]
-Who produced this buffoonery?

476
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,618
Who permitted this cretinism?

477
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,871
Who messed up real bad?

478
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,041
-It was--
-Me!

479
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,793
It was me. I did it!

480
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,379
Everyone here knows I stink
at delegating! [chuckling]

481
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:58,882
So, it was definitely me
who came up with "Small Pocks."

482
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:02,678
[chuckles] So, about that job?

483
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,096
Everyone out.

484
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,348
The Board must deliberate.

485
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,726
Fabricio, you still got
that executive desk,

486
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,813
the Carrara one?
Yeah, it's sold. To me.

487
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,107
I have to tell them it was my fault.

488
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,566
They're gonna fire you!

489
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,735
Eh. Been there. Came back.

490
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,404
Losing you would be far worse.

491
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,322
You saw the mess I made.

492
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,992
I saw a natural leader take charge.

493
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,576
One who's going to be stronger than ever

494
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,663
now that she's learned the first rule
of executive decision-making--

495
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,456
never trust Marketing!

496
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,083
[door opens]

497
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,378
Start date. For me. Go.

498
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:40,215
OCB, you have offered zero business ideas

499
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,051
and clearly just want Boss Baby's job.

500
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,095
Your contract is terminated.

501
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,807
Please. [chuckles] If I-- if I could have
a moment to defend my actions--

502
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,393
Leave now and you'll still receive
your day rate.

503
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,311
Plus expenses?

504
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,438
I'll bill you. Adios!

505
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,275
I know what you did... for Staci.

506
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,818
Sir, there's an explanation.

507
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:04,031
Yes. This company has a leader
who knows how to delegate.

508
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,241
And a future that looks very bright.

509
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,410
Couldn't agree more, sir.

510
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,454
Now, our present?

511
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,122
Oof. It is bad.

512
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,791
Someone needs to take the fall for this.

513
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,877
Thinking Chip, maybe? Or, uh--

514
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,420
Thinking you.

515
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,422
One-week suspension.

516
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,174
I look forward to your return.

517
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,676
A full week suspension?

518
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,096
