00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,438
But then it's spring!

175
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,273
Rain season. Babies splashing in puddles.

176
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,774
So cute! So much baby love!

177
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:22,984
Faster! Faster!

178
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,155
They're still trying to get in.

179
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,406
[snarling]

180
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:32,326
-Are you sure you can keep this up?
-I have to. [gulps]

181
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,870
People are counting on me.

182
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,496
[strains]

183
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,790
This plan is madness, Dr. No-Sho-Bot!

184
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,418
The Earth needs sunlight to tell time
so people can show up

185
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,836
for stuff they agreed to do!

186
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,546
[electronic hum]

187
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:48,551
All right, then.

188
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:52,555
Since you like sunblock so much,
you're about to get smothered with SPF 2.

189
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,931
As in the two of us!

190
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,349
Lance, now!

191
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,310
I'm doing space stuff!

192
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,483
That's right!
It's me, Lance Windsorknot!

193
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,735
More space stuff!

194
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:06,903
Angry squirrel!

195
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:10,198
Wait, we're fighting Angry Squirrel?
Not Dr. No-Sho-Bot?

196
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,908
No! Actual angry squirrel!

197
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,911
-[shouting, grunting]
-[squirrel chittering]

198
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,455
-[laughs] That was awesome!
-Right?

199
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,749
Almost as fun as listening
to all your invention ideas

200
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,125
and playing Get That Baby!

201
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,628
Ten times. I counted.

202
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:27,048
It's like you know exactly what I love
to do, and you keep suggesting it!

203
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,133
I know. Crazy.

204
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,053
I was thinking for our next mission,
though, we could maybe--

205
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,347
Take on an intergalactic chore monster?

206
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,641
Or an intergalactic toffee stealer?

207
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:40,061
-Or--
-An intergalactic anniversary gift.

208
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:40,978
I know that mission.

209
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,688
The one where everything's planned,

210
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,733
and then my brother abandons me
on planet BP-233.

211
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,486
The BP stands for "broken promises."

212
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:51,197
The only space missions he cares about
are office space missions.

213
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,824
Magic! Show me all the magic!

214
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:54,867
Great idea!

215
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:58,204
I'll get my Jonathan Pumpernickel
Junior Illusionist Magic Kit!

216
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,121
[sighs]

217
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,874
[slurring] Sometimes a business
is acquired.

218
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:06,963
And sometimes two businesses
can... [gags] merge.

219
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,840
And sometimes... business...

220
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,676
Stuffed.

221
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:15,304
-[babies gasp]
-[groaning]

222
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:16,889
[echoing] It's too much, Boss!

223
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,350
You can't take any more
cupcake business metaphors!

224
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,523
[muffled heartbeats]

225
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:26,899
Morale.

226
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,442
Morale!

227
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:38,077
[Jimbo] But you can do cupcake sandwich
business metaphors!

228
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,290
-You can do it! Come on!
-[all cheering]

229
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:46,877
[grunting]

230
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:47,795
[both gasp]

231
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,630
-[babies groan]
-Aw, man.

232
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:54,051
[Boss grunting]

233
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,220
Of course! A cupcake sandwich!

234
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,307
Look at this thing.
It's teeming with financial metaphors.

235
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,224
Am I right?

236
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,226
-Yeah, yeah, yeah!
-Metaphors, ja!

237
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:05,438
-[Peg] Just teeming! It's teeming, yeah!
-[Bug growls]

238
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,481
[Boss] Mmm!

239
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,275
-They're gone!
-[spits]

240
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,944
Great. I had zero
cupcake sandwich metaphors.

241
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,404
Also, I'm very ill.

242
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,699
-Cupcake party on!
-[all cheering]

243
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,120
[Tim] Your card is... the queen of hearts!

244
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,205
Nope.

245
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,666
Because it's the two of clubs!

246
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,501
Jack of clubs.

247
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,544
Spades?

248
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,630
Something with a seven.
King of hearts?

249
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:31,714
King of hearts?

250
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,507
Yes! Is it the king of hearts?

251
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,217
It's the king of hearts!

252
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,178
-I knew it! Let me see.
-[gasps]

253
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,804
[munching]

254
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,890
Oh, you mean, mm, this card?

255
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,558
[gulps] Oh, my bad.

256
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,771
It's okay. My magic tends to make people
hungry... for more magic!

257
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,901
Mm, I'd really like to make
that anniversary--

258
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:56,739
Ladies and gentlemen, for my final trick,
I will now read Hendershot's mind.

259
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,492
On the count of six, we will both say
the present we're gonna make

260
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,077
for Mom and Dad's anniversary.

261
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,706
And if we don't say the same thing,
no anniversary gift will be made.

262
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,708
[gasps] Where'd those stakes come from?

263
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:08,959
-One.
-[gasps]

264
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,836
-Gifts, gifts, gifts.
-Two, three...

265
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,339
-Oh, why are you saying numbers so fast?
-Four.

266
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,092
"Usually it's a snow globe,
but it could also be candy."

267
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,677
-Five... six!
-[wavering]

268
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,513
-Snow globe!
-Ca-- Snow globe.

269
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:21,597
It worked!

270
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,225
Holy heck, that trick never works
with my other brother!

271
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:25,226
I mean, real brother.

272
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,186
I mean-- Snow globe time!

273
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,648
-[monitor chiming]
-What's up, Beebs?

274
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,775
-[laughter, chatter]
-You guys!

275
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,318
Where's Tim? He's not picking up.

276
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,737
-Here.
-Templeton, I'm on my way.

277
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,823
Also, please don't say "cupcake"
for a month.

278
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,492
-You don't have to come.
-Tim, I'm coming. I mean it.

279
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,035
And I mean I don't want you to.

280
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,496
Family time isn't something you do
when it's convenient.

281
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,081
-Who said it was?
-You did.

282
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,667
When you broke your promise
to help with this anniversary gift.

283
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,794
Don't worry.
Hendershot and I are taking care of it.

284
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,838
You're getting Mom and Dad
an upside-down jar?

285
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,005
It's a snow globe!

286
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,507
Looks like an upside-down jar.

287
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,051
It'll start as a jar, but it's gonna end
as a snow globe.

288
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,512
Because that's what we decided
at the same time.

289
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:02,680
Because Hendershot gets me.

290
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,641
Oh! I see what's happening.

291
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:09,186
Look, Tim, the only reason
Hendershot knows you so well

292
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,646
is because I do.

293
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:11,981
What are you talking about?

294
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,065
Show him, Hendo.

295
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:19,613
Everything anyone could ever know
about you is in that dossier,

296
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,199
which I wrote, because I pay attention.

297
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,702
Because I'm a great brother.

298
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,246
-[Tim growls]
-Hey! That cost a fortune to bind!

299
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,832
You wrote a file on me
and gave it to your office buddy,

300
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,792
and you think that makes you
a good brother?

301
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:32,960
I believe I said "great."

302
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,087
Stay at work as long as you want!

303
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,299
You love your job so much,
why don't you marry it? [smooching]

304
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:41,385
"I love you!
Let's raise a family of job babies! Mwah!"

305
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:45,389
Fine! Maybe I'd rather spend time
with people who actually appreciate

306
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,515
the hard work I do.

307
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,808
-Good!
-Great!

308
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,310
-Cupcake!
-[gags]

309
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,023
There are my favorite babies
who appreciate everything I do.

310
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,316
You bet we do!

311
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,692
That stand-off, Boss?

312
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,402
[laughs] Ooh, legendary!

313
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,779
Morale could not be higher.

314
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,324
You saying I can't get it higher?
I can get it higher.

315
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,534
Because I care about all of you.

316
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,952
In fact, I'll do it right now.

317
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,329
I'm free. I got time.

318
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:12,500
-You really don't have to.
-But I want to, and I will... to.

319
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:13,959
So...

320
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,671
Sir, is everything all right?

321
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,673
You bet it is! Watch!

322
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,802
I said, "Lady, if you don't land
that spoon of pudding in my mouth,

323
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,471
I'm gonna call the FAA!"

324
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,931
Ha! What did she say?

325
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,642
She said... [speaks gibberish]

326
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,477
'cause I broke her brain when I spoke!

327
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,979
[babies laughing]

328
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,942
-You are so good at picking crayons!
-Aah!

329
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:38,901
Thanks! Heh.

330
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,488
Then I said, "Sir, this car seat's
not gonna buckle itself!"

331
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:43,739
Then what did he say?

332
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:46,784
He was like, um... [speaks gibberish]

333
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,285
'cause his brain was broken!

334
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,663
-Oh, ja.
-[forced laughter]

335
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:54,083
In recognition of her grace
under crayon pressure,

336
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:58,837
this Brass Eagle of Courage
goes to R&amp;D Baby Simmons!

337
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,924
[whines] I want one.

338
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,717
-That's not fair!
-Where's my Brass Eagle?

339
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,844
-I'm courageous, too!
-[babies grumbling]

340
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,764
-Uh, it's fine. I don't need it.
-I can fix this.

341
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:09,807
Uh, good news!

342
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,850
Everyone gets an eagle!

343
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,769
[all cheering]

344
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,479
Now I definitely don't want it.

345
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,106
It's not special anymore.

346
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,359
So, I said, "Sorry,
I'm a baby and you're a person,

347
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:23,904
so your brain is broken." [laughing]

348
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:27,867
I never thought I'd ask this,
but can I please go to work now?

349
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,120
Uh, the puppies
are still in Conference Room B,

350
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,872
so we're meeting in A now.

351
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,290
It's fine, NBD.

352
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,917
-Yes, BD!
-Ow! Watch it!

353
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:40,671
Listen up! Peg just told me the puppies
have taken back Conference Room B,

354
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,090
where so many fun memories
were made earlier!

355
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,509
And she wants us to help her get it back!

356
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,469
-Not what I said!
-Her words.

357
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,597
And I say we help her!

358
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,100
Because we're a corporate family,
and family never gives up on each other!

359
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,894
Testify!

360
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,937
-Uh, okay.
-Okay.

361
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,023
Now, come on! Hyah!

362
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,026
We need to talk.

363
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:05,029
About this awesome snow globe? Sure.

364
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:08,324
I did take a couple creative liberties,
but I have a feeling you'll like them.

365
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,034
You don't know what I like!

366
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:15,205
I know you're mad, but what do you say
to pizza with ice cream on top, uh?

367
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,834
I say, "Grumble, grumble,"
which is stomach for "awesome"!

368
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,127
[gasps]

369
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,670
You're cheating again!

370
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,591
You say cheating, I say distracting
in order to refocus on the task at hand.

371
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,468
You know, tomato, tomahto... sauce...

372
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,928
on pizza... with ice cream.

373
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,429
Aah! Stop it!

374
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,349
Go! I want you out!

375
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,060
Look, dude, can we just finish
this snow globe?

376
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,770
I just need you to sign it, that's it.

377
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,980
Then the job's done
and I'll be out of your hair, okay?

378
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,065
No-kay.

379
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,692
Well, it's no-kay with me
to leave a job unfinished.

380
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,236
I am Manager Baby Hendershot, baby!

381
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,113
-I deliver!
-I'm not signing anything.

382
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,865
-Sign it!
-I will not!

383
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,241
Oh, yes, you will,

384
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,535
right after you forget
you're even mad at me!

385
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,121
-Not happening!
-Draw Marisol from memory!

386
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,581
I genuinely would love to!

387
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,500
Aah! Stop doing that!

388
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,795
We don't have to dance
this cha-cha, my man.

389
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,923
I know you better
than you even do, Tim. [echoes]

390
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,260
You do know Tim,
but you don't know...

391
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:11,845
Mit.

392
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,681
What are you doing?

393
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,057
Who's Tim? I'm Mit.

394
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,308
I didn't even say "Tim."

395
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,268
Mit doesn't wait for his name
to be called.

396
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,980
He's a stone-cold,
back-of-the-class delinquent.

397
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,815
Careful! You're gonna break that!

398
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,608
You mean this thing Tim loves?

399
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,193
Yeah, Mit don't care.

400
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,528
Where's my homework?

401
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,030
[laughs] Ooh-hoo, Mit loves homework.

402
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,574
I don't know what's happening,
but I'm not having it.

403
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,534
Take the pen!

404
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,911
Okay, I won't take the pen.

405
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,830
I said take the pen!

406
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,289
Right, don't take the pen.

407
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,207
Got it.

408
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,750
That's not what I said!

409
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,169
Ah, church slacks.

410
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,005
The favorite pants of Mit.

411
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,924
Uncomfortable everywhere
is how Mit gets comfortable.

412
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,384
I can see how this is fun for you.

413
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,427
This is not fun.

414
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,178
Exactly. What I just said.

415
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,556
Why don't you see what it says about Mit.

416
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,307
It doesn't say anything about Mit.

417
00:16:57,474 --> 00:17:01,061
Trust me, I studied this thing
front to back and back to-- [gasps]

418
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,689
"Mit" is "Tim" back to front!

419
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,232
You're doing opposites, right?

420
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,650
-Wrong.
-[growls]

421
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:07,860
-Stop it!
-Keep going?

422
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,653
We are finishing this snow globe

423
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:13,365
right after we go into the phone book
and call everyone named...

424
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,242
Yolanda!

425
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,710
[strained] That's a very normal name.

426
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:26,795
You weren't saying?

427
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,005
[gasps]

428
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,758
[straining, sighs]

429
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:31,967
No good.

430
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,677
These doors must lock from the inside.

431
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,055
[knocking] Give us the room!

432
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,391
[snarling]

433
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,809
When you're done with it?

434
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,270
That's my sassy tactic! How dare you?

435
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,731
Sir, Conference Room A is fine.

436
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:46,815
Fine?

437
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,942
It's got that-- that jiggly door handle!

438
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,945
And I don't know who threw out
leftover sushi on a hot Friday night

439
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,947
after the cleaning crew
had already come through,

440
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,574
but when the air blows just right...

441
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:58,285
oh, you better believe
you can still smell it.

442
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:03,290
No, no, no, my superstar employees
deserve Conference Room B.

443
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,459
So, if those puppies won't come out,

444
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:09,463
we'll just come up with a super-fun,
morale-boosting way to get them out!

445
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,923
Ooh, I have an idea!

446
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,634
Also, no one else can come up
with the solution but me!

447
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,681
Boss, is everything all right?

448
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,141
Perfect! Why?

449
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:26,605
I just think this is getting to be
a bit much... for everyone.

450
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,899
Do you speak for everyone, Staci?

451
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,234
Yes, she does!

452
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,944
You made us crawl into a vent,

453
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:35,072
and now I've got
two co-workers' butts in my face!

454
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,657
Trust me, everyone.

455
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,991
This is going to be great!

456
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,119
One, we're a great team.

457
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,913
Two... we have the element of surprise!

458
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,206
[Boss laughing]

459
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,960
To conference room victory
and the spoils of morale!

460
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,129
Surprise! Aah!

461
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:55,425
-[groans]
-[babies shouting]

462
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:56,718
-[groans]
-[Peg] Great!

463
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,930
Now I've got three co-workers' butts
in my face!

464
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,140
[barking]

465
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,767
-[monitor chiming]
-Staci, I need backup!

466
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,270
Tim's gone all Opposite Day on me.

467
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:09,022
I am thirsty for vegetables.

468
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,317
It's messing with my brain,
and I love my brain!

469
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,737
Sorry, but we've got our own
off-the-wall Templeton to deal with.

470
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,991
[Boss] We didn't fail;
we succeeded at making a memory!

471
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,868
-Everyone agree!
-[sighs]

472
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:24,246
Looks like we're both stuck
in a Templeton brothers nightmare.

473
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:25,956
-[gasps] Ow!
-[thuds]

474
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,166
My precious brain.

475
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,084
But also, I have an idea.

476
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,881
Hey, Mit, can you not hand me
that dossier?

477
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:34,965
I cannot.

478
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:38,927
What if I didn't know a way
to not get back at your brother?

479
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,138
I'm not listening.

480
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:44,349
Did you know there isn't
one of these dossiers on BB

481
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,769
back at Baby Corp that you could not use
to manipulate your brother

482
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,272
the way he didn't manipulate you?

483
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,316
There isn't? Don't take me to it!

484
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,234
Good! I won't!

485
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,364
I'm sort of confused and I really wanna
take off these church slacks.

486
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,741
So, fine, I'm Tim again.

487
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,868
Now, take me to the dossier on my brother.

488
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,494
You're sure this is right?

489
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,246
Oh, yeah.

490
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:11,418
The secret entrance to Conference Room B
is definitely this way.

491
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,045
Definitely.

492
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:16,215
Good! Those puppies are gonna have
no idea what hit them!

493
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,842
Then I'll tell them it was me,
so they know!

494
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,011
Sir, I have to say something.

495
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,639
-You're transferring to Wichita?
-What? No!

496
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,849
You're obsessing over the wrong thing.

497
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,768
The puppies aren't the problem.

498
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,186
Sure seems like they are.

499
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,980
Well, yeah, they're today's problem.

500
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,483
But tomorrow it'll just be something else.

501
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,026
Not seeing your point here, Stace.

502
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,028
I can't just ignore today's problem.

503
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:41,240
-Company morale--
-Is like any other relationship.

504
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:44,451
It's gonna have ups and downs,
but you can't try to fix everything

505
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:48,163
with a few super intense minutes
of forced time together.

506
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,415
-That makes a lot of--
-But right now's an exception.

507
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,251
-Jimbo!
-Aah!

508
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,212
Hey, not cool!

509
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,672
[sniffs] What is that?

510
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,925
[gasps] Lingering hot weekend trash fish!

511
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,843
This is Conference Room A!

512
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,012
Hey! [shouting]

513
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,222
[growls]

514
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,267
[both] Oh.

515
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,187
Whatever's off with you two,
it's wreaking havoc with Baby Corp.

516
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,647
So, fix it!

-[both shouting, grunting]
-[objects crashing]

518
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:25,409
Ooh! Is it weird that I feel bad
for that chair?

519
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,035
[shouting and crashing continue]

520

-[blows landing]
-[babies] Ooh!

521
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,915
I didn't know an earlobe
could bend that way!

522
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,626
-Writing that one down for later.

-[loud crash]
-[babies] Ooh!

525
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,426
Then what did he say?

526
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:45,012
He said... [speaks gibberish]

527
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,222
'cause I broke his brain when I spoke!

[clears throat]

530
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,562
Eh, right, apology time.

531
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,231
I've learned a lot today about--

532
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,359
[Peg] Don't get your diapers
in a bunch... again.

533
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:02,195
[all laughing]

534
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,781
Yeah, you guys get it. My bad.

535
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,242
No more super intense bonding quick fixes.

536
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,744
Take the rest of the day off.

537
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,038
My brother and I have
a bar mitzvah to get to.

538
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,372
Anniversary!

539
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,416
[gasps] The gift! We forgot!

540
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,792
[Hendershot] No, we didn't.

541
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,503
But there is one thing left to do.

542
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,423
[wavering] Aah!

543
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:24,217
-Who tosses two things?
-Come on, man!

544
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:25,927
[Tim] What are we gonna do?

545
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:30,682
Eh, never underestimate how low parents
will set the gifts-from-children bar.

546
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,691
We love it so much!

547
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,401
[Janice] Thank you!
