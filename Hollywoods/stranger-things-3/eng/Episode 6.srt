00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,353
But now, for some insane reason,

298
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,439
the Russians appear to be trying
to reopen it,

299
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,150
which just destroys everything
we risked our lives for.

300
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,360
By "we," you're including Lucas?

301
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,444
Yes, of course.

302
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:07,531
So, all that shit you told me,
Lucas was there?

303
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,534
- Yeah.
- My brother, Lucas Charles Sinclair?

304
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,618
Yes!

305
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:12,952
I don't believe you.

306
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,998
Wait, so you believe everything about El
and the gate

307
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,561
and the Demodogs and the Mind Flayer,

308
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,085
but you question
your brother's involvement?

309
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,712
That's correct.

310
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,297
Makes total sense.

311
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,091
- Um, you need help with that?
- No.

312
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,928
- Well, I mean, it's taking a while, so...
- Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.

313
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:32,473
All right, so if we don't find a more
efficient method to stop these fans,

314
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,935
we're never gonna find help,
and your ice cream buddies are screwed.

315
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,729
Yeah, with that attitude, they are.
Jee-zus!

316
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,272
I'm just being realistic.

317
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:44,944
I mean, we've made it about
point-three miles in nine hours.

318
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,196
Then we had to walk three hours
down that tunnel,

319
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,991
so I'd estimate ten miles back
to the elevator,

320
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:55,079
which should take us approximately
twelve-and-a-half days.

321
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,665
Did you just do all of that in your head?

322
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:58,874
I'm good with numbers.

323
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,210

324

326
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:08,384
- Okay, you better take that back, nerd.
- Can't put the truth back in the box.

327
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,303
- But it's not the truth.
- Let's examine the facts, shall we?

328
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,139
<b><font color="#808080">FACT ONE:</font></b> You're a math whiz, apparently.

329
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,183
That was
a pretty straightforward equation.

330
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,394
Fact number two:
You're a political junkie.

331
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,980
Just because I don't agree
with Communism as an ideology...

332
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,941
Fact number three:
You love <i>My Little Pony.</i>

333
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,568
And what does <i>My Little Pony</i>
have to do with this?

334
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,571
Ah, let's recall the ponies'
latest adventure, shall we?

335
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,198
The evil centaur team and Tirek

336
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,617
turns Applejack into a dragon
at Midnight Castle,

337
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,221
and then Megan and the other ponies
have to use Moochick's magic

338
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,605
to defeat his rainbow of darkness,

339
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,540
saving them from a lifetime
of enslavement.

340
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,209
All the pink in the world can't disguise
the irrefutable fact

341
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:45,087
that centaurs and castles
and dragons and magic

342
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,797
are all standard nerd tropes.

343
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,174
Ergo, <i>My Little Pony</i> is nerdy.

344
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,719
