He can bend like Gumbo.

He looks pretty normal to me.

Normal? How many times

519

520
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:08,762
More than a little.

521
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:11,723
He was in a tub with ice.
The Mind Flayer likes it cold.

522

- Plus everything else...
- But he's lounging at the pool,

the least Mind Flayer thing ever.

Not necessarily.

00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,567
The Mind Flayer likes to hide.

526
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,319
He only used me when he needed me.

527
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,489
It's like... like you're dormant.

528
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,492
And then, when he needs you,

529
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:32,785
you're activated.

530
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,955
Okay, so we just...

531
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,498
wait until he gets activated.

532
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,999
No. What if he hurts someone?

533
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,084
Or kills someone.

534
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,627
We can't take that chance.

535
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,712

- I have an idea. Boys only.

- Seriously?
- Just trust me on this one.

538
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:58,270
Okay, so we wait until the pool closes,
until everyone leaves,

539
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:01,356

to come from here and...
