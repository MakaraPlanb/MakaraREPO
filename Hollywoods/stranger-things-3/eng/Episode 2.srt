- Just like your magnets.

790
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,406
Okay, why is nothing happening?

791
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,324
Oh, because our field is stable.

792
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,493
But, if we reduce the current...

793
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:15,996
How...

794
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,874
The magnetic dipoles tried to orient
according to the field, but...

795
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,752
No, no, no, I mean,
how is this happening at my house?

796
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,003
You want my honest opinion?

797
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,714
One of your kiddos got up
in the middle of the night,

798
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,925
bumped into the fridge,
and knocked the suckers loose.

799
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,760
And the magnets at Melvald's?

800
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,096
- Apophenia.
- Apo-what-o-whah?

801
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,848
Apophenia. Uh...

802
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,260
You're seeing patterns that aren't there.
Coincidence.

803
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,185
But what if...

804
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:39,895
it's not?

805
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:41,563
Well...

806
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,776
Theoretically-speaking,

807
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:51,532
I suppose some large version
of this AC transformer could exist.

808
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,534
A machine of some kind.

809
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:54,535
A machine?

810
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:58,330
But, in order to reach your house
and downtown, gosh,

811
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,294
that would take
billions of volts of electricity

812
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:02,626
and cost tens of millions of dollars.

813
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,670
But it is possible.

814
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,256

815

817
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,180

841

00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,576
Exactly.

Well, I guess we translate the rest
and hopefully a pattern emerges.

848
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,509
A pattern. Right, like maybe "silver cat"
is a meeting place?
