[Belkacem] Stop, don't move!
Everyone get off the bike!

179
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,760
[man] Take the mask off!

180
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,680
Which one is he? Fuck!

181
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,720
- Police! Stop!
- Which one?

182
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,120
- [man] Take the mask off!
- [captain] Lock the park!

183
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,640
No one gets out! Understand?

184
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,240
This is impossible! Where is he?

185
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,760

204
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,040
- I make spelling mistakes all the time.
- Hey, we all do it.

205
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,680
But my father never did,
let alone twice in a row.

206
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,920
- Yeah? And?
- Look at this.

207
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,560
- "Comit" and "libraryes."
- [Benjamin] Sure.

208
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,160
- And?
- I checked it out.

Wait a second, Assane.

216
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,400
That's called a, um… coincidence.

217
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,280
Are you serious?

218
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,160
Two spelling mistakes and there's
a hidden message? You're reaching.

219
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,360
You don't understand.

220
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,320
It's all been right here.

221
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,560
I could have proven his innocence
25 years ago, thanks to Comit.

222
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,360
But I did nothing.

223
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,240
You know what? You're right.
You have doubts, you need answers.

224
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,120
See this to the end. Go see Comit.

225
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,640
- Where is he now?
- Still in prison.

226
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,080
- Perfect. Go visit him.
- He's sick and doesn't leave his cell.

227
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,680
- Well, okay…
- I got another way in.

228
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,240
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

229
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,800
- No, no, no.
- You said, "See this to the end."

230
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,760
I gotta meet with Comit.

Hey, cousin. What's up?

239
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,040
Have a seat.

240
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,440
What makes you think
you and I are cousins?

241
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,920
I don't have cousins.

242
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,480
Well, you have one now.

243
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,520
And your cousin has a present for you.

244
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,240
You… get out.

245
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,680
And I stay in your place.

246
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,600
[Djibril laughs loudly]

247
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,400
Hang on. Are you… totally stupid or what?

248
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,200
Oh, I know!

249
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,000
So, uh, the guards won't notice
anything is going on

250
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,280
because you and me look so similar,

251
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,000
we're practically twins.

- [watch beeps]
- There.

256
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,480
The guards just changed shifts.

257
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,720
And the other inmates?

258
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,760
You've been here with the new arrivals
for about a week now.

259
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,680
And tonight, you'll get your transfer.

260
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,000
And nobody knows you
in the prison you're headed to.

261
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,680
Sure,
but you're forgetting something, right?

262
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,520
Oh, shit, the handcuffs.

263
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,040
"Oh, shit, the handcuffs."

264
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,240
I'm so stupid.

265
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,040
How did I not think of that?

266
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,840
- You know the handcuff trick?
- The handcuff what?

267
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,720
Well, now you do.

268
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,200
Hey, guard! We're finished.

269
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,440
Hey! I know why you're here.

270
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,960
If you deal so much as a joint,
I'll find you.

271
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,400
I got you out of here.
I can get you back in.

272
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,040
- See you, cousin.
- Go ahead.

273
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,320

<i>We respect all individual faiths here.</i>

283
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,520
But on a personal level,
there was one book

284
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,920
that brought me some answers

285
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,000
and some comfort.

286
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,520
Welcome, my boy.

THE HOLY BIBLE

288
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,400
[Laugier] Madame Pellegrini, one thing
still bothers me about this situation.

289
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
We had no audio, but based on the video,

290
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,360
we got the impression
you two might have, um…

291
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,800
well, that you knew each other.

292
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,200
[Juliette chuckles]

293
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,120
And I, Captain, have the impression
that you're treating me like a suspect.

294
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,720
- Am I being accused of something here?
- No, of course not.

295
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,000
If that's the case, there's no problem.

296
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,960
You can detain me. I'll call my lawyers
and you'd be fired within the hour.

297
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,520
Shall we do that?

298
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,960
- No, hang on...
- I suggest you change your tone.

299
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,560
And focus on your investigation.

300
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,760
I'm just asking what you said
to each other. That seems reasonable.

301
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,840
Absolutely.

302
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,360
I told him that, um…

303
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,160
I told him the officer
working in this case was a total moron

304
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,360
who brought me a necklace made of plastic.

305
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,240
Aren't you taking notes?

306
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,120
Find our necklace, Captain.

307
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,280
You wouldn't want
to disappoint your superiors, right?

308
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,520
- No, madam.
- [Juliette] Well, that's great.

309
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,520

- What do you want with Étienne?
- Nothing. We have a mutual friend.

And who is your friend?

00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,800
- Just got here. Already something wrong.
- Fine, Marc. I can handle it.

353
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,120
Take a seat.

354
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,840
Okay, what's wrong with you?

355
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,560
It started in my stomach.
Hasn't gone away.

356
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,640
Mm-hm.

357
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,200
I thought I might be pregnant.

358
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,280
- Hmm.
- I don't think it's that.

359
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,360
Probably not. Unlikely even.

360
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,600
And I figured a…
a night in the infirmary,

361
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,600
for observation, may be good.

362
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,240
[inhales deeply]
Well, listen… I know it's hard at first.

363
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,040
But a big boy like you,
he'll get used to it. Yeah?

364
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,200
My night in the infirmary?

365
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,840
You'll have to try harder.

366
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,640
- Okay.
- Okay.

367
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,136
- [Guédira] Got a minute?
- I'm meeting the boss.

368
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,840
Please, come here.
I've found something incredible.

369
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,480
Look.

370
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,320
Paul Sernine.

371
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,880
Luis Perenna.

372
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,320
- What are you doing?
- [Guédira] Don't you see it?

373
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,960
Anagrams for Arsène Lupin.

374
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,320
- And?
- [Guédira] And it adds up.

375
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,160
Must be a connection
between the thief and Arsène Lupin.

376
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,000
We should follow this lead.
Should I go tell Laugier?

377
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,920
Yeah, sure. Great idea.

378
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,800
Especially if you wanna look stupid.
Laugier's in a great mood.

379
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,600
Seriously, Youssef, what is this?

380
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,360
What's next? D'Artagnan and The Three
Little Pigs? Go do some real work.

381
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,480
[Laugier] We had this guy
and now he's gone. We need to do better.

382
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,120
This guy puts on a delivery costume,
and we're dead!

383
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,920
It's a disaster!
This guy is screwing with us!

384
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,560
We're nowhere! We're lost!

385
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,440
This investigation is bullshit!

386
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,160
[prisoners shouting]

387
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,200
- Quick question.
- What do you want?

388
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,080
- How am I supposed to get you the dope?
- What the fuck are you doin'?

389
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,840
I'm just curious.

390
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:18,200
Are you stupid? He swallowed it,
then pulled it out of his ass.

391
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,040
Ah! There you go.

392
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,360
That is exactly
where you can put your money.

393
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,280
He has a death wish.

394
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,280
[Assane groans]

395
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,760
[prisoners shouting]

396
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,720
[nurse] There you go.

397
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,560
I suppose you did this to yourself?

398
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,440
Yeah, a stupid accident.

399
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,200
I was shaving… and I slipped.

400
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,280
Oh.

401
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,800
[nurse sighs]

402
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,560
Well, I'm gonna keep you overnight.

403
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,880
Well, all right.

404
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,880
But you're gonna have to make
some friends. It's useful here.

405
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,960
Hmm?

406
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,240
[Assane] Good night.

407
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,560
[sighs]

408
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,480
[whispering] Étienne?

409
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,960
Étienne?

410
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,480
- Étienne?
- [breathing deeply]

411
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,920
My name is Assane Diop.

412
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,920
My father was Babakar Diop.

413
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,080
You were in prison together.

414
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,800
[door opens]

415
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,240
[inaudible conversation]

416
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,400
Étienne?

417
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,800
[weak voice] Babakar?

418
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,000
Yeah. You remember?

419
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,080
Yeah, maybe, yeah.

420
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,640
- Isn't he the one who stole a necklace?
- Yes…

421
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,800
Well, no.

422
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,360
That's why I'm here.

423
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,400
He was wrongfully accused.

424
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,240
I don't know your father.

425
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
No.

426
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,760
- That's impossible.
- Yes.

427
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,280
What do you mean?

428
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,200
He was alone in his cell.

429
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,640
Under surveillance.

430
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,320
I only saw him once because…

431
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,880
I brought him a book

432
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,320
when I worked in the library.

433
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,520
But that's all.

434
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,720
No. There has to be something else.

435
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,040
- Huh?
- [breathing weakly]

436
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,200
Please, try to think.

437
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,760
Étienne…

438
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,360
[inaudible conversation]

439
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,760
When he returned the book, he told me…

440
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,840
Yeah?

441
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,240
He said that if someone came
on his behalf someday,

442
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,600
he wanted me to give it to him.

443
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,080
He said that all the answers were inside.

444
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,040
And you still have the book?

445
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,840
Maybe I do.

446
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,760
Look through my things.

447
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,320
[Assane groans]

448
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,920
[church bell ringing]

449
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,040
You don't wanna play?

450
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,080
This came this morning. From your father.

451
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,720
The guards found it
when they cleaned his cell.

452
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,560
Are you familiar with the Andrésy school?

453
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,760
It's one of the best private schools
in France.

454
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,400
Apparently, someone wants you
to attend it next year.

455
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,160
A generous donor has already paid.

456
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,440
Assane,

457
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,040
you'll get a great education there.

458
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,160
You can become something.

459
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,520
You have to take this chance.

460
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,200
Nothing's set in stone.

461
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,840
I'm glad you like it, by the way.

462
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,200
[melancholic music playing]

463
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,720
[Babakar] <i>"My son, I'm ashamed.</i>"

464
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,560
<i>"But I'm guilty of what I'm accused of."</i>

465
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,000
<i>"I wanted to give you a better life."</i>

466
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,080
<i>"I failed."</i>

467
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,480
- 241!
- [prisoner] Yeah?

468
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,320
Shit, clean sheets. Better than the Ritz!

469
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,520
- Where are Étienne's things?
- Second shelf.

470
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,880
[indistinct chatter]

471
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,600
- Right.
- Good luck.

472
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,760
[prisoner] Anksi?

473
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,720
THE EXPLOITS OF ARSÈNE LUPIN

474
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,560
[Claire] How was science class?

475
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,640
- Raoul, I'm speaking to you, sweetie.
- Hmm?

476
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,080
- [Claire] Did your science test go well?
- Mm-hm.

477
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,680
- That the book you got from Papa?
- [Raoul] Mm-hm.

478
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,600
- [Claire] Wow, he scribbled on every page.
- Hmm.

479
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,240
You prefer reading to video games?

480
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,440
What do you know!

481
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,320
[suspenseful music playing]

482
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,160
"Am…"

"Innocent…"

[groans loudly]

490
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,840
Bogdan hopes you enjoy your meal.

491
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,000
He'll tuck you in tonight.

492
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,400
[prisoner shouting]

493
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,920
What the hell is this?

494
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,720
Lock him up. Everyone back in their cells!

495
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,640
[Juliette] This is gonna sound
like a weird question, but I, um...

496
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,200
I need to know

497
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,000
if…

498
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,720
Well…

499
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,400
Was it really Babakar
who stole the necklace 25 years ago?

500
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,480
What?

501
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,200
The foundation is in trouble

502
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,040
because a necklace worth millions
was stolen

503
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,800
and you're pissing me off with something
that happened God knows when?

504
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,760
Of course he stole that necklace!

505
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,360
[Hubert sighs]

506
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,080
Forgive me.

507
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,440
I'm sorry, darling.

508
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,440
No. I'm sorry.

509
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,440
[Hubert] I spend my days
being attacked by almost everyone.

510
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,320
And when it comes from you…

511
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,160
it hurts so much more.

512
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,560
You're with me.

513
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,800
Hmm?

514
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,280
You're with me?

515
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,400
Yes, yes.

516
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,560
[prisoner shouting]

517
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,280
Look who it is.

518
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,400
Come on. Let's do this.

519
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,480
[prisoners shouting]

520
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,640
Here!

[Assane groans]

522
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,240
Tonight.

523
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,960
This is ridiculous.
Are you in love with me?

524
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,200
[Assane chuckles]

525
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,920
How is he?

526
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,760
Can I have a minute?

527
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,760
Thank you.

528
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,840
How's it goin', buddy?

529
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,880
I think she likes you.

530
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,360
Did you find the book?

531
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,640

Great.

Can I ask you something?

534
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,160
Anything you want.

535
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,800
I don't care how you do it,

536
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,680
but make my wife smile.

537
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,680
I won't be able to anymore.

538
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,320
Promise.

539
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,280
Okay.

540
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,160
Thanks for the book.

541
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,120
I have what I need.

542
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,920
Now I can clear my father's name.

543
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,240
Lovely to meet you.

544
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,360
You need to hang on, Djibril.

545

Assane.

Assane!

600
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,240
25 years ago, you framed my father.
I know you did.

601
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,600
What did you do to him?

602
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,760
Assane…

603
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,040
What did you do to him?

604
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,840
I made him sign a confession.

605
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,560
- But you know that I'm innocent!
- That isn't the issue.

606
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,640
- Of course it is!
- Babakar, trust me.

607
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,600
It's better to be guilty and free
than innocent in prison.

608
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,840
Just sign it. Think of your son.

609
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,880
For Assane.

[Anne] <i>His confession was supposed
to guarantee him a reduced sentence.</i>

611
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,560
<i>I was told the judge would be receptive
to your family's situation.</i>

612
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:01,240
<i>An immigrant from Senegal
raising his son alone in France.</i>

613

<i>Your father couldn't accept it
and he hanged himself.</i>

615
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,320
The confession
that should have saved him was his doom.

616
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,720
[sighs] I was naive.

617
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,520
There were agreements made.

618
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:22,040
Agreements are only good for people
like you. Never for people like my father.

619
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,640
After your father's death,
I helped you, Assane. I helped you.

620
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,200
I did it from a distance.

621
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,560
From a distance, but I helped you.

622
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,160
It was you?

623
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,760
The generous donor?

624
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,680
It was you?

625
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,120
[Anne] I felt responsible
for the situation you were in.

626
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:52,440
I wanted to earn your forgiveness
and your father's.

627
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,800
- I did it for your father.
- For my father?

628
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,600
You accuse him, you drive him to suicide
to ease your conscience?

629
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,360
I didn't accuse him of anything!

630
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,360
A police officer swore to me
that he would help him!

631
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,400
- That's the whole story.
- Which officer?

632
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,560
[Anne] He lied to me!

633
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,560
[Assane] Which officer?

634
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,720
- No, that was such a long time ago...
- No!

635
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,280
Tell me now!

636
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,160
What's his name?

637
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,240
- [Anne]<i> Dumont. His name was Dumont</i>.
- Open.

638
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,560
[Anne] Inspector Dumont.

639
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,560
Dumont knew my father trusted you
and he used that against him, huh?

640
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,840
Why would he do that?

641
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:39,920
I don't know.

642

- I think he's lost.

00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,040
[chuckles] See his costume?
Kind of looks real. Where'd you get it?

649
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,480

they let janitors through here.

650

Let's be polite.
It's not how we treat new students.

651
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,560
Don't make me tell the director.
