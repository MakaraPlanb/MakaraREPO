<i>And you never found it.</i>

155
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,520
Because you only had a suspect.

Why did you insist
on getting that confession?

164
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,920
Because that guy, he wouldn't recant.

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,720
This wouldn't have anything to do
with the burglary at the Louvre, huh?

178
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,880
<i>The same necklace, 25 years later.</i>

179
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,880
Is there a connection?

180
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,880
[music playing on TV]

181
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,080
INVESTIGATION REPORT - DUMONT
PELLEGRINI NECKLACE 1995

182
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,920
Yeah. The reference?

183
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,480
It's 95-CF-JRT-43.

184
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,520
I came for the file a couple of days ago.
Pages are missing.

185
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,760
Are you sure?

186
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,320
Okay, thank you.

187
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,800
[Guédira] What's going on?

188
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,480
- Dumont's been kidnapped.
- What?

189
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,720
Okay, listen to me. We've been alerted
that they can't find Commissioner Dumont.

190
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
He was at City Hall in the 3rd Division.

191
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,160
He was last seen there
about two hours ago,

192
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,600
talking to a computer tech.

193
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,920
Is there a description?

194
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,440
No, not yet. You and Guédira,
call City Hall and interview everyone.

195
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,880
Hey! I want all hands on deck. Understood?

196
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,160
All right, let's go!

197
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,520
- [electronic whine]
- [Assane] <i>Wake up, Dumont.</i>

198
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,440
You've had a pretty good life.

199
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,760
<i>Beautiful children, a loving wife.
You've given them everything.</i>

200
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,200
But I have a question.

201
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,000
How much does a commissioner make?

202
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,280
Six, seven thousand a month tops?

203
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,080
Even with overtime,
nobody makes what you make.

204
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,520
So, earlier, it was Babakar Diop,
and now my salary is the problem?

205
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,480
Ludovic Reynaud, well known by drug rings.
Mostly deals in coke.

206
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,160
<i>Showbiz, fashion.</i>

207
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,520
<i>Throws big parties.</i>

208
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,840
<i>Damir Cilic.</i>

209
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,120
<i>Ten years in prison
for armed robbery and pimping.</i>

210
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,400
His passion is trafficking girls
from the East, including minors.

211
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,880
<i>Not very glamorous.</i>

212
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,920
<i>Of course, the money isn't wired
into your savings account.</i>

213
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,320
I looked it up.

214
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,400
<i>Secret accounts aren't
what they used to be.</i>

215
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,680
<i>Those guys paid
for a lot of your vacations.</i>

216
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,400
So, Commissioner,

217
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,280
were you just doing your job there?

218
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,920
You're turning me in to Internal Affairs?

219
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
[Assane]<i> No.</i>

220
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,680
That wouldn't be very fun.

221
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,080
But your wife…

222
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,880
No, please don't.

223
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,320
[Assane] <i>I guess we'll see.</i>

224
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,960
Just tell me why you framed Babakar
and it's over.

225
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,640
<i>What do you want me to say?</i>

226
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
<i>I did my job, I caught the guy!</i>

227
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,720
He hung himself. It's very sad.
What do you want me to do?

228
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,760
Suit yourself.

229
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,520
[rapid beeping]

230
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,480
[ringing tone]

231
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,360
- [female voice] <i>Hello?</i>
- Hélène?

232
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,200
Hélène, it's Gabriel.

233
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,840
<i>I'm okay.</i>

234
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,920
[Hélène] <i>Hello?</i>

235
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,280
Hélène, it's me!

236
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,160
[Assane]
<i>Save your breath. She can't hear you.</i>

237
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,800
<i>- </i>Not yet.
- [Hélène] <i>Hello, Gabriel?</i>

238
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,240
<i>Gabriel, is that you? Hello!</i>

239
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,120
Last chance, Dumont.

240
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,360
[Hélène] <i>Hello!</i>

241
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,680
<i>Please answer!</i>

242
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,560
Go fuck yourself! You hear me?

243
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,240
<i>- You wanna rat me out? Be my guest.</i>
- [line goes dead]

244
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,600
<i>Yeah, I took the money.</i>

245
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,400
I didn't spend it on watches or coke.

246
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,040
The money was for my kids!

247
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,520
I'd do anything for them.

248
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,600
<i>Even the horrible shit.</i>

249
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,040
And Babakar...

250
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,960
<i>- He fucked up for his kid too.
- </i>What? Tell me what you know.

251
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,800
The guy was fresh off the boat
from Senegal.

252
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,760
He doesn't have a single euro.

253
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,040
There's a kid to raise.

254
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,600
<i>I can understand it.</i>

255
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,640
- I would've done the same thing.
- [Assane]<i> Not possible.</i>

256
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,560
Someone pressured you into framing him.

257
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,680
They didn't have to.

258
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,800
Because, believe it or not,
I liked my job then.

259
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,880
I was good at it.

260
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,440
[panting] <i>Can I have water?</i>

261
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,200
<i>I beg you.</i>

262
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,760
<i>I need it.</i>

263
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,640
[cell phone vibrating]

264
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,120
- Hey, Claire.
- Hey, how are you?

265
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,040
I'm good.

266
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,720
[Claire] <i>I wanted to ask if you'd thought
of something for Raoul's birthday?</i>

267
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,480
- [groans lightly]
- <i>Hello?</i>

268
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,480
[Assane] <i>Yeah?</i>

269
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,960
You forgot?

270
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,560
[Assane] <i>No, are you serious?</i>

271
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,760
<i>Forget my son's birthday? Give me a break.</i>

272
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,360
I have an idea, but it's a surprise.

273
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,800
Assane, you know you said the same thing
last year to me? You remember?

274
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,120
[chuckles] Yeah, I do have a surprise.

275
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,400
[Claire] <i>This is bullshit.</i>

276
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,000
What are you doing
that's keeping you so busy?

277
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,080
<i>It's crazy.</i>

278
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,240
- I'm just filing some old paperwork.
- [Claire]<i> I'm not an idiot.</i>

279
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,960
I know you're not filing old paperwork.

280
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,600
<i>You don't have to lie to me.</i>

281
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,080
<i>I don't know what you're doing and I…</i>

282
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,640
Well, I'm not sure I even want to know.
Do I want to know?

283
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,360
No, you don't.

284
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,360
That bad?

285
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,160
That bad.

286
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,480
You know you can talk to me. I…

287
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,280
We stopped sleeping together,
but we're still friends.

288
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,200
I know.

289
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,280
[chuckles]

290
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,160
Thank you, my friend.

291
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,600
Take care of yourself.

292
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,760
[Assane]<i> I promise.</i>

293
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,480
Don't do anything dumb.

294
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,600
[Assane] <i>Never.</i>

295
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,360
Bye.

296
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,920
Talk to you soon, Assane.

297
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,880
[bell ringing]

298
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,240
Have a nice day.

299
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,000
[boy 1] Hey, Claire.

300
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,280
How are you doin'?

301
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,160
Need help with your homework?

302
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,880
[boy 2] What's that?

303
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,200
[indistinct chatter]

304
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,640
[boy 1] You could tutor me.

305
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,760
[boy 2] Sound good, Claire?

306
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,040
She's so shy!

307
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,520
- You know you wanna.
- Excuse me. Everything okay?

308
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,560
- [boy 3] Who's that?
- New kid.

309
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,560
- Is that your boyfriend?
- Who's yours?

310
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,760
What did you say?

311
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,840
Hey, hey, hey!

312
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,360
Everyone sit down and be quiet.

313
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,040
Fucker.

314
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,120
You good?

315
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,680
No, I'm still shaking.
How can I ever thank you?

316
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,160
Let me tell you something.

317
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,360
In life, there's two kinds of guys.
There's barbarians and knights.

318
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,480
The barbarians don't give a shit.
They invade your space.

319
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,280
Then there's the knights,
people sort of like you.

320
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,120
They think women are fragile little things
that always need protecting.

321
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,920
And you know what's funny?
Both break my balls equally.

322
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,440
- You're Assane?
- Yeah.

323
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,680
I heard about your dad.

324
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,840
- I'm sorry.
- [teacher] Silence!

325
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,320
Well, settle in, Sir Knight.

326
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,080
Take off your coat. Stay a while.

327
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,320
My name's Claire.

328
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Hello, Claire.

329
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,800
[soft music playing]

330
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,360
- [Belkacem] They live together?
- [man] Belkacem?

331
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,440
Okay, great.

332
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,320
- Okay?
- All right, I might have something.

333
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,320
This van circled City Hall for an hour.
Last seen right after the kidnapping.

334
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,640
It goes north and we lose it on Magenta.

335
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,080
I ran the license plates.

336
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,080
PERRÉE STREET

337
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,480
- Is this him?
- Yeah, with the orange hat.

338
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,320
- Anything clearer?
- [man] No.

339
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,600
And Dumont? Got his phone?

340
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,880
[man] Stopped working
after he left the briefing.

341
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,040
Orange Hat must've gotten rid
of the SIM card and the battery.

342
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,400
- How long has Dumont had his phone for?
- Why does that matter?

343
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,880
They updated the chipsets
on officers' phones.

344
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,440
Since GPSs have autonomous batteries,
you can maybe track him down.

345
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,960
- Okay.
- I could try.

346
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,200
Get out of the way!

347
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,800
- It's the same principle as the GPS...
- We could all care less. Just do it.

348
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,920
It's gonna take a while.
His GPS battery has to be active still.

349
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,320
[Assane sighs]

350
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,720
Okay, Dumont.

351
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,760
[Hélène] <i>No, sweetie, I took it.</i>

352
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,520
[Assane] <i>I know your entire life.
I know your family.</i>

353
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,640
<i>"Being perfect is so much work…"</i>

354
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,720
You son of a bitch!

355
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,440
- If you touch my kids, I'll kill you!
<i>- </i>[Assane] <i>Calm down.</i>

356
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,560
<i>I won't hurt your kids.</i>

357
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,480
But you, Dumont…

358
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,960
<i>You're getting fat, Dumont.</i>

359
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,960
<i>You're a fucking loser, Dumont.</i>

360
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,880
It's called a deepfake.

361
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,760
It's good, don't you think?

362
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,480
<i>Why don't you just tell the truth?</i>

363
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,480
<i>Corruption is my passion.</i>

364
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,920
- You bastard.
- [Assane]<i> I have your voice.</i>

365
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,120
Your face, your expressions,
your body language. All of it is here.

366
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,960
<i>I can make you say anything.</i>

367
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,760
<i>In an hour, the news can get a video
of you saying you're a member of ISIS.</i>

368
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,240
Or a pedophile.

369
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,840
<i>I love hanging around
after kids get out of class.</i>

370
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,520
- [Assane]<i> Whatever I choose.</i>
- You're fucking sick!

371
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,040
<i>Tell me what you want!</i>

372
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,520
I want the truth.

373
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,760
I've already told you the whole truth

374
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,960
and you don't like it!

375
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,720
Stop your lying right now!

376
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,800
You liar!

377
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,440
Tell me why you framed my dad!

378
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,480
Assane?

379
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,160
[electronic whine]

380
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,040
[Dumont]<i> Assane Diop?</i>

381
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,880
Assane,

382
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,800
is that you?

383
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,120
[Assane sighs]

384
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,240
[Guédira] Okay…

385
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,720
You know what you're doing?

386
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,400
- I can't go faster on 128 bits.
- I don't give a shit.

387
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,120
- We don't have time!
- The van's at Pantin. Let's go?

388
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,000
No, we wait. Make sure Dumont's phone
is in there. The van could be a decoy.

389
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,840
- Where are we at?
- The van went to Pantin.

390
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,880
Waiting to see
if Dumont and his phone's there.

391
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,600
If Guédira figures out what he's doing,
maybe we won't be here all night.

392
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,360
We got it!

393
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,800
Okay, we have Dumont. He's at Pantin!

394
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,480
Come on, all hands on deck!

395
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,960
Go! Perraud, Moretti, go!
Let's move, let's move!

396
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,080
Everyone at Pantin! Go, go, go!
Come on, let's move it!

397
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Assane…

398
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,240
<i>Are you there, son?</i>

399
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,280
<i>You know, I remember you.</i>

400
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,640
<i>I was young and trying to look tough.</i>

401
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,000
<i>I… I shouldn't have spoken
to you like that.</i>

402
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,600
<i>Please, forgive me.</i>

403
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,880
I'm sure your dad was a good man.

404
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,040
<i>Just tell yourself he was tempted.
That's all.</i>

405
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,160
<i>It happens to all of us.
I know that better than anyone.</i>

406
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,200
You accuse me
of forcing your father to lie,

407
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,520
but what are you doing?

408
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,960
The only difference between your father
and me is that I'm innocent.

409
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,760
I just… I just want to see my family.

410
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,520
<i>You have a family too, right?</i>

411
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,080
<i>Think of them.</i>

412
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,880
Untie me, and disappear.

413
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,480
I… I won't turn you in.

414
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,600
<i>I promise.</i>

415
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,400
[children shouting indistinctly]

416
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,320
Hey, guys. Look.

417
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,760
- [boy 1] Claire with the Black kid!
- [boy 2] What are they doin'?

418
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,440
Come on!

419
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,560
How's the book going?

420
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,280
Awesome.

421
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,280
Lupin's like Romeo.

422
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,240
Meaning?

423
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,720
The guy's got game. Does he get the girls?

424
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,840
I guess he gets a… He gets around.

425
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,640
Okay, awesome.

426
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,240
No, that's not what I meant. What I like
is he's always planning something.

427
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,760
- He's not afraid of anything.
- Hey, lovebirds.

428
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,600
Don't move. It's like with bears.
Play dead and they go away.

429
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,000
I don't think that's ever been proven.

430
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,440
- You think they've already screwed?
- Yeah, looks like they have.

431
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,960
Assane, what did I say
about barbarians and knights?

432
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,160
Stay calm.

433
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,120
[groaning]

434
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,240
- [Assane gasps]
- Sorry.

435
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,720
You're a total moron.

436
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,760
[Claire laughs]

437
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,640
Assane!

438
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,720
- Wait, what?
- "Wait, what" what?

439
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,560
I don't need a boyfriend.
I'm just fine on my own, okay?

440
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,480
You say that because you don't know.

441
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,520
- What?
- That I'm the man of your dreams.

442
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,840
Uh, well…

443
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:34,000
Yeah, you're my only guy friend, so,
technically, you're the man of my dreams.

444
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,320
- Wait, wait.
- What?

445
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,840
I'm the man of your dreams,
but I can't kiss you?

446
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,480
Yeah, that's it, you got it.
You're not <i>that </i>stupid.

447
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,640
Now let me finish cleaning this, please.

448
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,880
Sorry.

449
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,400
And stop moving!

450
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,920
- Wait.
- [Claire] What?

451
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,440
[Assane] Where did that come from?

452
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,560
No way!

453
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,680
And even when Lupin loses,

454
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,240
he still wins.

455
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,000
[Claire chuckles]

456
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,680
- Stop pushing!
- Calm down.

457
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,760
I'm not pushing on it. I'm cleaning it!

458
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,840
[sirens wailing]

459
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,360
[tires screech]

460
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,960
Still at Pantin.
If the GPS battery dies, we're in trouble.

461
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,360
- What the hell? Move!
- [horn blares]

462
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,680
- Move!
- [engine revving loudly]

463
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,800
[siren wailing]

464
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,920
[electronic whine]

465
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,480
Look…

466
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,720
<i>I always say…</i>

467
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,040
people don't change.

468
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,680
<i>But I'd like to change my mind about you.</i>

469
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,720
<i>I want to believe you.</i>

470
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,360
<i>You may not be a knight,
but you're not a barbarian either.</i>

471
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,440
<i>So...</i>

472
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,160
I forgive you, Dumont.

473
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,800
[beeping]

474
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:55,080
TIME ELAPSED

475
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,320
[siren wailing]

476
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,160
[tires screech]

477
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,680
Police! Freeze! Don't move, don't move!

478
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,040
- What do you have on you?
- I didn't do anything! I got nothing!

479
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,280
All right, heads up!

480
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,840
[Laugier] Easy, easy.

481
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,280
[Guédira] Over here.

482
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,480
- [laughter]
- He's just fucking with us.

483
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,840
It's useless.

484
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,680
He's been screwing with us
this whole time. Now he could be anywhere.

485
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,320
Bring him over.

486
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,080
- What is this shit?
- I don't know.

487
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,920
- Guy with the orange hat, you know him?
- No, I swear. He put a "wanted" ad online.

488
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,320
Two hundred euros in cash
to drive around City Hall and to Pantin.

489
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,240
- Hear this?
- I didn't ask anything else.

490
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,200
[Laugier] We saw you with him.
Where did you drop him off?

491
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,360
- City Hall in the 3rd Division.
- Hey! Are you listening to us?

492
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,360
We didn't ask where you picked him up!

493
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,720
- Where did you drop him off?
- [man] City Hall in the 3rd Division!

494
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,360
He told me to go around the block
and he got out.

495
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,240
I was just supposed to wait for him here.

496
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,200
He isn't coming back?

497
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,120
All right, just get him out of here.

498
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,640
He's at City Hall.

499
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,080
- What?
- What makes you think that?

500
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,880
The guy kidnaps someone
and stays in the same place?

501
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,360
Who would be stupid enough to do that?

502
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,640
Arsène Lupin.

503
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,240
Arsène Lupin does that in a book.

504
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,600
Arsène Lupin… [chuckles]

505
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,120
[suspenseful music playing]

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,920
[sirens wailing]

507
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,200
[Laugier] Check all the floors!
We'll search the basement!

508
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,120
This way.

509
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,760
Come on!

510
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,840
Clear!

511
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,560
Go, go, go!

512
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,960
- In here!
- [cartoon playing on TV]

513
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,280
Here!

514
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,880
Commissioner, are you all right?

515
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,160
Commissioner, are you injured?

516
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,680
- We have the commissioner.
- Fucking son of a bitch!

517
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,880
ARSÈNE LUPIN
GENTLEMAN BURGLAR

518
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,080
Don't you ever get tired
of reading the same book?

519
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,080
No, I learn something new every time.

520
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,560
I was thinking of what you said
about the two types of guys.

521
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,480
Yeah?

522
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,520
I think there's a third type.

523
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,080
He doesn't care about anything,

524
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,560
except what matters.

525
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,000
He plays the game,

526
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,200
but respects the rules.

527
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,360
- You gonna tell me who this third type is?
- A gentleman.

528
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,720
What?

529
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,280
[soft music playing]

530
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,760
I like being with you.

531
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
[chuckling] Don't get carried away!

532
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,840
It's not like that.

533
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,400
I just like the idea
that we'll always be here for each other.

534
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,320
[chuckles] Sounds good.

535
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,480
"Sounds good"?

536
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,480
You told me
that I shouldn't get carried away.

537
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,600
- Oh, a gentleman then?
- Exactly.

538
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,160
[Claire chuckles]

539
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,840
Dumont gets kidnapped by a guy

540
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,160
that he can't seem to describe
in any detail.

541
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,880
The guy locks him up for four hours
and says nothing,

542
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,280
then he just leaves?

543
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,880
Boss, I'm sorry, but it makes no sense.

544
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,760
I know that you see it.

545
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,760
So, the real question is,
why would Dumont lie?

546
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,760
Look, he's Commissioner Dumont, Belkacem.

547
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,160
He puts his own guys on the case.
What can I do?

548
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,600
Get back to the necklace case.
Where are you at?

549
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,960
Still on Paul Sernine.

550
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,920
I checked social media
and his profiles were all fake.

551
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,520
Captain! Can I talk to you
about the necklace?

552
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,240
Oh, no, please, not Lupin again.

553
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,800
The guy with the orange hat,
the one who kidnapped Dumont,

554
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,200
I think it's Paul Sernine.

555
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,160
Wait. What did you say?

556
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,920
These three guys are the same person?

557
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,640
- Yeah.
- Okay, what do you mean?

558
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,440
- What connects these cases?
- The connection…

559
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,360
It's here.

560
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:50,080
The commissioner led the investigation
when the necklace was first stolen.

561
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,360
[birds singing]

562
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,400
[door creaks shut]

563
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,880
[ominous music playing]

564

566
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,640
[clatter]

567
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,840
That fucking…

568
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,280
[Dumont sighs deeply]

569
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I quit.

570
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,600
So,

571
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,080
you think he's innocent.

572
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,720
I checked his location the day
of the theft. It's impossible it's him.

573
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,400
And the prints on my safe?

574
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,000
The lab guys think they were planted there
to incriminate the suspect.

575
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,080
You don't say?

576
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,320
Fascinating story.

577
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,320
But who planted them?

578
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,840
I get the feeling you have a theory.

579
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,640
I think you're unfamiliar
with the administration you work for.

580
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,520
I'm gonna save you a little time.

581
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,000
You play golf with my commissioner,
have dinner with the Prefect,

582
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,200
you're friends with the Interior Minister,

583
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,280
but I'll see this investigation through.

584
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,520
How is your wife?

585
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,360
Hélène, that right?

586
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,720
Pediatric nurse,

587
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,280
various hours, lots of driving at night.

588
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,200
Fearless.

589
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,360
I'm a good investigator too.

590
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,440
[inhales deeply]

591
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,720
This is all a game, Inspector.

592
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,440
A game with rules.

593
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,040
And I'm the one who makes them.

594
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,680
So, here's what's going to happen.

595
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,520
Babakar will sign a confession.

596
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,160
You'll solve a big case.

597
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,720
It'll launch your career.

598
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,720
He'll never sign.

599
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,800
Yeah.

600
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,080
See? You've just had a brilliant idea.

601
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,880
You're gonna suggest to my wife
that she ask him to sign

602
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,040
in exchange for a reduced sentence.

603
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,120
Guaranteed.

604
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,040
And everybody wins.

605
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,600
But if Babakar signs a confession
without returning the necklace,

606
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,200
the prosecutor's gonna give him
maximum sentence.

607
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,360
Probably,

608
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,120
but he won't know that.

609
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,680
And my wife can't know either.

610
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,880
Come on, Dumont.

611
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,000
The police are gonna need people like you.

612
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,560
And me,

613
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,920
I need you right now.

614
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,040
Still quitting?

615
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,320
For Assane.

It's about Babakar Diop.

628

There's a new party involved.
