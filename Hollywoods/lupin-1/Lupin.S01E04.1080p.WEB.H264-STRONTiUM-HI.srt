00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,360
[suspenseful music playing]

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,080
[distant siren wailing]

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,120
[drone buzzing]

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,280
[snoring]

00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,400
[drone buzzing]

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,800
[buzzing gets louder]

8
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,600
[beeping]

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,920
[alarm blaring]

12
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,000
What?

13
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,120
What… what is this?

14
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,560
Mr. Pellegrini, you need to get up, sir.

15
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,920
- [Hubert] What is this?
- [guard] The perimeter is compromised.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,880
Follow us to the panic room, please.

17
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,560
[alarm continues blaring]

18
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,840
- [guard] Hurry up, please.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,160
What the fuck's this?

20
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,600
Where is it?

21
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,400
- [drone buzzing loudly]
- Here!

22
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,840
I got it, I got it!

23
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,520
Don't move, don't move!
Get the door, Ludo!

24
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,040
[guards panting]

25
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,080
- We took out the intruder.
- Who? Where is he?

26
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,360
- What the hell is this?
- [guard] It's been destroyed.

27
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,600
- Along with any information it had.
- Fine.

28
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,640
[Hubert sighs]

29
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,240
I'LL GET YOU

30
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,920
Perimeter's clear.
I've checked everywhere.

31
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,880
[indistinct chatter]

32
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,960
How's it going, Dumont?

33
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,560
What? Don't you recognize me
without my glasses?

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,920
Assane?

35
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Mm-hm.

36
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,040
That's me.

37
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
Cheer up, Dumont.

38
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,680
I brought you a gift.

39
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,160
Your Circé.

40
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,920
[distant siren wailing]

41
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,560
Don't you need one?

42
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,440
- Tell me what you want.
- I want to know about your friend.

43
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,640
- My friend?
- Pellegrini.

44
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,440
What did you want
to tell him the other day?

45
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,880
[Assane chuckles]

46
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,200
Where's your wife?

47
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,520
- At work.
- No.

48
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,680
She's not there.

49
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,120
- You leave my family out of this!
- She should be at work.

50
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,920
She has nothing to do with this!

51
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,680
Tell me about Pellegrini.

52
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,760
[Dumont sighs]

53
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,960
If I give you a name,

54
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,000
you swear you'll stop?

55
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,320
I swear.

56
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,760
Do I have your word?

57
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,680
You got it.

58
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,760
Can I trust you?

59
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,840
No.

60
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,360
You got a choice?

61
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
You wanna take down Pellegrini?

62
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,280
There's a woman named Fabienne Bériot
who can help you.

63
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,920
A journalist.

64
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,040
A few years ago, she almost got him.

65
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,880
I didn't tell you.

66
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,040
[Assane sighs]

67
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,080
Hmm…

68
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,640
See you soon.

69
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,760
[phone keys beep]

70
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,080
[ringing tone]

71
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,080
- [Hélène] <i>Hello?</i>
- Where are you?

72
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,200
[Hélène] <i>At the office. Something wrong?</i>

73
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,080
- No, nothing.
- [Hélène]<i> Are you okay?</i>

74
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,920
No, it's fine.
I just wanted to say I love you.

75
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,760
[Hélène]<i> All right, I love you too.</i>

76
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,960
Yeah, have a good day.

77
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,560
[Hélène]<i> I'll see you tonight.</i>

78
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,640
[phone beeps]

79
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,000
[Dumont sighs]

80
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,080

FABIENNE BÉRIOT TO PAY
RECORD FINE TO HUBERT PELLEGRINI

82
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,560
[distant siren wailing]

83
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,360
J'accuse?

84
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,040
[beeping]

85
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,080
[door buzzes]

86
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,440
- J'accuse!
- [dog whimpers]

87
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,280
FABIENNE BÉRIOT
DIRTY MONEY - THE PELLEGRINI SYSTEM

ITEM ADDED TO YOUR CART

89
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,160
- Come on.
- [dog panting]

90
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,520
You're bringing the groceries up
next time.

91
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,720
[dog whimpers]

92
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,200
[clatter on floor]

93
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
So…

94
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,360
What's your story, Fabienne Bériot?

95
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
[Fabienne] Come on.

96
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,360
[Fabienne gasps]

97
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,640
Don't be afraid.

98
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,760
Afraid of what?

99
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,480
I'm not scared.

100
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,160
I'm too old and too weak.

101
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,440
If you plan to steal something,
you'll be disappointed.

102
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,400
The most valuable thing here
is a bottle of shitty Merlot.

103
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,960
- I look like a thief?
- No, like someone who broke into my home.

104
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,520
[Assane] I'm not a thief.

105
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,600
I'm a fan.

106
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
Sign it for me?

107
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,200
What is this?

108
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,280
[Assane] Your book.

109
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,160
- I don't think so.
- Come on.

110
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,440
- I know you're Fabienne Bériot.
- She used to live here.

111
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,520
Not anymore.

112
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,720
[distant siren wailing]

113
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,640
[plates clatter]

114
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,320
Fabienne, I need you.

115
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,200
Fabienne? Fabienne doesn't exist anymore.

116
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,400
She was reduced to silence
by big business!

117
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,040
- Right, J'accuse?
- [J'accuse whimpers]

118
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,960
[Assane] What you wrote is the truth.

119
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,800
It was the truth, but, well,
I found myself facing an army of lawyers.

120
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,400
I hadn't the means to defend myself.
I got crushed.

121
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,320
We have an enemy in common.

122
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,560
- Pellegrini.
- [J'accuse barks]

123
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,320
Listen, I'm very busy.
Don't let me keep you.

124
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,560
You're like me.
You want revenge on Pellegrini.

125
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,640
[J'accuse barks]

126
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,080
- Pellegrini.
- [barks]

127
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,680
Yeah, okay, I taught him to bark
when he hears the name Pellegrini,

128
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,160
but it's an old trick now.

129
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,160
- I'm useless.
- That's impossible.

130
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,160
You were a killer back then.

131
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,800
Pharmaceutical labs,

132
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,480
corrupt politicians…

133
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,000
You took them all down,
so, what about him?

134
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,040
You don't wanna fight?

135
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,280
Isn't it worth it?

136
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,960
How do I know
you're not working for Pellegrini?

137
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,040
[J'accuse barks]

138
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,640
Maybe he sent you here just to make sure
that I'm still at rock bottom.

139
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,040
Well, take a good look. Still there.

140
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,920
All right? Have a good day!

141
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,840
Twenty-five years ago, he framed my dad.

142
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,480
He made him look like a thief.
He had him thrown in jail.

143
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,200
And my father hanged himself.

144
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,680
I was 14.

145
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,560
Pellegrini, he ruined my life too.

146
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,760
You're the only one
who fought against him.

147
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,280
I need your help.

148
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,920
This book is powerful,

149
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,280
courageous.

150
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,920
Where's the woman who wrote it?

151
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,160
I want to finish what you started.

152
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,760
Hmm?

153
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,960
No, I'm sorry.

154
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,080
Pellegrini's heavily protected.

155
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,720
No one or nothing can get to him.

156
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,880
Let it go.

157
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,360
Get out.

158
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,040
Go home.

159
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,800
[door opens]

160
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
[door closes]

161
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,720
[Dumont]<i> Let me make sure I understand.</i>

162
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,880
You think my kidnapper is the same man
who stole the necklace?

163
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,840
Because?

164
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,000
Because you were in charge
of the investigation 25 years ago.

165
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,360
- That's all?
- [Belkacem] There's also the MO.

166
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,640
So, with the theft at the Louvre,
as well as your abduction,

167
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,320
we all think there's always a…

168
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,240
Showmanship.

169
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,600
[Belkacem] Exactly. Showmanship.
And that links both cases.

170
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,960
And, if I may be permitted,
I want to mention something.

171
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,960
- I know I'm the only one...
- Youssef…

172
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,360
I may be alone in this, but I believe
there's a shared inspiration.

173
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,440
Nobody wants to hear it.

174
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,040
- I'm allowed to speak my mind.
- Shared inspiration?

175
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,440
Okay, and who's the inspiration?

176
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,720
[Guédira inhales deeply]

177
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,400
Arsène Lupin, Mr. Commissioner.

178
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,640
<i>Gentleman Burglar</i>. By Maurice Leblanc.

179
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,640
<i>The Queen's Necklace</i>
was published in 1923 in <i>Le Journal.</i>

180
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,280
A classic adventure of Lupin's.

181
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,080
Our suspect's pseudonyms,
Paul Sernine or Luis Perenna,

182
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,000
both are anagrams of Arsène Lupin.

183
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,160
Also the method,
the panache, the style, the talent.

184
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,480
I know he's impersonating Arsène Lupin.
In fact, I'm convinced.

185
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,760
I made a list of all the similarities
I found. I can send it to you.

186
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,080
Oh, yes, of course.
I want that list at once.

187
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,000
There we are.

188
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,160
Because now that you mention it,

189
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,920
I remember.

190
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,440
The guy who kidnapped me
wore a top hat and a monocle.

191
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,720
We've got footage
from surveillance cameras.

192
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,960
We'll call witnesses
for a composite sketch.

193
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,000
We will have the face of your attacker.

194
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,560
Perfect. I'm not holding you back.

195

[cell phone dings]

196
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,440
YOU WANTED TO TALK ABOUT BABAKAR DIOP.
WHEN?

[Dumont tapping phone keys]

198
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,960
I NEED MORE INFORMATION.
I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED.

[J'accuse whimpers]

204
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,320
How did you find me?

205
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,000
A good journalist
never reveals her sources.

206
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,360
You change your mind?

207
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,280
Pellegrini took
the most precious thing I had. My career.

208
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,880
And more. He made sure
nobody in Paris would ever hire me.

209
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,720
Blacklisted.
He made me seem like a crazy cat lady.

210
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,720
- That's not the truth.
- Well, no.

211
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,840
You're more of a dog lady.

212
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,680
[inhales deeply] When you're a woman,

213
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,840
and you're my age and you look like me,
the decision is made.

214
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,920
You're trash.

215
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,080
But he went a little too far.

216
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,680
I've nothing left.

217
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,920
And I've nothing left to lose.

218
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,080
[Fabienne chuckles]

219
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,880
When you came to my place,

220
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,440
when you showed me my book,
believe it or not,

221
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,760
it was the first time
anyone had spoken to me in days.

222
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,480
And moreover, you said nice things.

223
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,960
And so, I thought about it.

224
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,960
- I'll help you.
- Are you sure?

225
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,520
A little rush of adrenaline
couldn't hurt me now.

226
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,160
[both chuckle]

227
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,040
And I don't want to see him win.

228
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,360
- Then I need to be able to trust you.
- You came to me first!

229
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,920
No, I need to be able to trust you.
Tell me your name.

[laughing] Yeah, yeah, right.

232
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,720
That's a nice try.

233
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,280
[Assane chuckles] Okay.

234
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,680
My name is Jean David.

[motorcycle roars by]

236
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,080
Okay, last chance or else…
you'll do this without me.

[Fabienne laughs]

243
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,000
This is an even bigger mess than my place.

244
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,280
[Assane] I broke into his house
to look at his files.

245
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,200
- [J'accuse whimpers]
- I was looking for information, but…

246
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,400
What do you want?

247
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,760
To bring him down.

248
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,560
Find some compromising documents.

249
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,320
I know he framed my father
to get the insurance money. I'm sure.

250
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,400
- In what year?
- 1995.

251
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,200
Yeah, that fits.

252
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,440
That's the year his company
was on the verge of collapsing.

253
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,840
He frames your father,

254
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,680
he collects the insurance,

255
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,000
and saves his empire.

256
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,480
He fooled everyone around him.

257
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,720
Except I just can't prove it yet.

258
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,440
We need everyone to know he's a criminal.

259
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,400
Well, I tried before you.
It didn't work out great.

260
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,320
Well, he could kill the story back then,
but not now.

261
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,840
- What do you mean?
- [Assane] We need something big.

262
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,520
We need to reveal something
that proves he's corrupt.

263
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,040
Something he can't cover up.

264
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,400
Something that'll make noise,
then he's done.

265
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,400
I may have something.

Uh, that's, uh…

270
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,360
That's not bad. It's not perfect.
Show me the next one.

There's this one. Is that better?

272
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,080
Yeah, that's looking great.

Yeah, this isn't bad.

I should decide if it's worth it or not.

to get this tape back now?

I almost got arrested for that!

355
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,960
It was to make sure no one watches it.

356
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,640
The attacks in Kuala Lumpur in 1996.

357

Ring any bells?

358
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,240
- A terrorist attack?
- Eleven murdered. Eight were French.

359
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,800
The truth is… it was a matter of revenge.

360
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,480
Some guy tricked the Malaysians
while selling them weapons.

361
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,440
And so, they blew up the French embassy.

362
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,400
And the crooked middleman was?

363
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,400
Pellegrini.

364
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,080

I'm warning you, gentlemen, it's all over.</i>

378
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,760
[man] <i>Okay,
in that case, you give us no choice.</i>

379
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,320
So, the guns they used,
Pellegrini was behind it all?

380
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,920
Maybe he used the insurance money
from the necklace to buy those weapons.

381
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,560
Let's spread the news.

382
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,040

[Assane] He betrayed his country.

384

I will have this posted on Twitter

How'd you get the tape?

393

A good journalist
never reveals her sources.

394
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,640
- [Juliette] It's an economics lesson.
- [Hubert] Perfect.

395
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,440
It's a charity dinner, not about finances.

396
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,440
If you want donors to support you,
they need to have trust.

- It needs to be fiscally interesting.

398

- That's the way it is.
- [Juliette] Stop, this is ridiculous.

399
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,880
No, it… Change the background color.
Make it cheerful.

400
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,000
- [cell phones ding]
- What's the matter? Are we boring you?

401
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,440
The plan's not complicated.
It's comprehensive.

402
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,360
Are we bothering you?

403
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,120

Thank you.

Would you explain?

407
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,800
I think you should explain.
Look what was just posted on Twitter.

408
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,720

It's not complicated. Just delete it.

Who's Salvator813?
It's a fake account. Anonymous.

414
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,200
- Do you know what he means?
- Absolutely not, honey.

415
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,320
Then why delete his tweet
if you don't know what it's about?

416
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,040
Maybe I'm paranoid, but I don't want
the world to think we're hiding something!

417
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,720
Oh, yeah? So, we don't then?

418
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,040
[Hubert] Exactly. There's nothing to hide.

419

Daddy, this foundation
really means a lot to me.

You know how invested I am,

421

you need to tell me now.

422

There's nothing.

What dates?

You know, that guy she's with tonight,
it's not the first time.

Our France

is a country we can be proud of.

472

the one who calls himself Salvator813

488
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,800

And that idiot Brizac…

525
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,440
You know the one you see
on all the TV shows, huh?

526
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,680
- Yeah.
- [Fabienne] He tried to ask a question.

527
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,520
You're out of your mind, monsieur!

528
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,200
It's Fabienne Bériot
asking the right question!

529
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,960
Before everyone else.
Just like the old days, huh?

530
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,280
Hang on. One of Pellegrini's guys
tried to follow me.

531
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,600
- What's that?
- Don't worry. I lost him.

532
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,680
You sure?

533
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,160
Listen, um, I… I have experience.

534
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,800
I think I know how to lose a tail.

535
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,400
[both laugh]

536
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,720
- What's up next?
- We go bigger.

537
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,160
- So, we post the entire video online?
- No, even bigger.

538
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,320
I contacted <i>The Other Edition</i>.

539
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,280
And I said that Salvator wanted to make
his TV debut and they didn't hesitate.

540
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,720
<i>The Other Edition</i>?

541
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,040
That's not journalism, Assane.

542
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,680
Two million viewers every night.
We could do worse.

543
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,320
Two million people will know the truth.
That's a lot of people.

544
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,080
Okay, okay, okay. I'm ready.

545
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,280
I know… But no.

546
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,760
Tomorrow, Salvator is me.

547
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,480
Are you kidding me?
I'm going with you. I am!

548
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,320
I'm the one that got you into this.

549
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,160
You've already done a lot.

550
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,040
Now it's my turn to take the risk.

551
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,480
It's for my father.

552
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,480
Well, what was your father like?

553
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,560
Hmm… Proud.

554
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,400
Honest.

555
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,040
He was stubborn too.

556
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,240
[Fabienne chuckles]

557
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,360
Like someone else I know.

558
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,600
- I don't know who.
- [Assane laughs]

559
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,000
Come on, let's go.

560
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,400
Time for the world to meet Salvator.

561
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,320
[Dumont scoffs]
Were your witnesses drunk or what?

562
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,400
Pardon?

563
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,200
None of them looks like the guy
who abducted me,

564
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,960
and also all four look different!

565
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,520
What about him?

566
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,560
[Dumont scoffs]

567
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,200
I took the forensic ID guy
to visit Vincent Morville.

568
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,960
Sernine's accomplice at the Louvre.

569
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,280
He was thrilled
to give us a very detailed description.

570
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,440
That's not him either.

571
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,840
So, for the last time,

572
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,200
stop trying to connect both cases.

573
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,680
The Louvre and my kidnapping,
it's unrelated.

574
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,120
- It's him.
- [Dumont] No, it's not him.

575
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,680
What he's trying very awkwardly
to tell you

576
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,600
is our suspect is greatly able
to change his appearance.

577
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,880
[Dumont]
You're greatly able to fuck with me!

578
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,600
The necklace has been gone three weeks
and you haven't made any progress.

579
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,440
I'll give the case to another team.

580
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,000
No, no, we can sort this out.

581
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,840
Okay, you two, you have one week.
That's it.

582
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,960
- What do you mean, "you two"?
- You know!

583
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,520
Hey, did you see his face
when I showed him the last sketch?

584
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,200
I'm not crazy. You know I'm not.

585
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,080
- There's something really wrong here.
- Thank you.

586
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,480
But you can't investigate
your commissioner.

587
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,720
Why can't we investigate him?
Hey, hey, hey.

588
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,120
See his face
when I showed him the last sketch?

589
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,160
Hey, Guédira, drop it for now, okay?

590
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,280
You heard Dumont. You're off the case.

591
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,040
Okay?

592
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,000
[Guédira sighs]

593
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,160
[Assane] Latex sponge.

594
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,400
Thank you.

595
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
- [Fabienne] Did somebody teach you makeup?
- [Assane] No.

596
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,840
I kind of taught myself.
It's part of what I do.

597
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,560
Number 12 brush?

598
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,800
Have you been living here long?

599
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,080
[Assane] Is this an interrogation?

600
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,200
Oh, no. Pardon me.

601
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,040
Old habits die hard. [chuckles]

602
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,240
[Assane] Smudge brush.

603
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,560
Thank you.

604
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,640
No, Fabienne.

605
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,520
This isn't a smudge brush.
This is a blending brush.

606
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,680
- Oh, you're serious.
- Yes, I'm serious.

607
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,120
I never joke about makeup.

608
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,200
Thank you.

609
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,560
Yep, that's the one.

610
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,800
By the way…

611
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,960
That's for you.

612
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,880
To say thank you.

613
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,640
I don't need a reward, Assane.

614
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,280
[Assane] I knew you'd say that.

615
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,720
But it's my pleasure.

616
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,040
[Fabienne chuckles]

617
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,840
I hope it'll make you want to write again.

618
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,680
You know, Assane,
the first time you came to my place,

619
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,240
you asked me if I was Fabienne Bériot
and I told you no.

620
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,320
I wasn't lying.

621
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,440
I haven't been that woman in many years.

622
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,120
You're the one
who brought back Fabienne Bériot, Assane.

623
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,440
And that's my present.

624
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,800
Thank you.

625
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,920
[Fabienne laughs]

626
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,400
[presenter] Tonight, on <i>The Other Edition</i>,

627
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,880
an exclusive interview.

628
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,960
Hubert Pellegrini,
one of the wealthiest men in France,

629
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,000
but also one of the most generous.

630
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:05,640
<i>His empire ranges
from import-export to energy and media.</i>

631
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,400
<i>Nothing's out of his reach.</i>

632
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,080
But tonight, our special guest is a man

633
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,160
who is questioning his integrity.

634
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,160
We are joined tonight by Salvator.
Salvator, good evening.

635
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:16,960
Hello.

636
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,000
[presenter] This is the first time
you're showing your face.

637
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,000
I'm just meeting you now,
so, you're either very brave,

638
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,520
or completely insane.

639
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,000
Your viewers will decide.

640
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,480
True. In any case, your appearance,
it may be surprising to people.

641
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,920
We weren't expecting…

642
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,520
well, you.

643
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,560
- Meaning?
- [presenter] You're, um…

644
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,480
- I'm old?
- You're aged.

645
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,640
When you have a Twitter account
and you battle injustice,

646
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,200
they assume you're young.

647
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,160
You're forgetting something,
though, Thomas.

648
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,920
You see, most people in this country
are older than you.

649
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,280
[Thomas]
<i>Okay, you got your message through.</i>

650
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,720
<i>You came here tonight
with a document, a tape</i>

651
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,200
<i>that is allegedly compromising.</i>

652
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,000
<i>Hubert Pellegrini even came out
of his legendary retirement</i>

653
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,400
<i>to say that he's not afraid of this video.</i>

654
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,640
- Mm-hm. That's right.
- [Thomas] Tell us a little more.

655
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,640
What will we see on this recording?

656
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,600
Go ahead. Set it up for us.

657
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:17,080
Well, you see, this footage is
from a meeting that took place in 1996.

658
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,600
In Malaysia.

659
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,080
We were able to see Hubert Pellegrini
selling illegal firearms

660
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,000
to the terrorists
who orchestrated the attack

661
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,040
on the French embassy at the same time.

662
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,120
That's insane.

663
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,400
Well, let's watch together.
Roll the tape, please.

664
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,280
<i>The situation has evolved on my end.</i>

665
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,160
<i>I don't like it either,
but that's how it is.</i>

666
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,200
<i>If you want to buy my weapons,</i>

667
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,680
<i>you'll have to pay double.</i>

668
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,240
<i>Impossible.</i>

669
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,640
[distorted sound on tape]

670
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,840
<i>I'm warning you, gentlemen, it's all over.</i>

671
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,040
<i>You can forget the deal.</i>

672
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,400
[Thomas] What was that?

673
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,960
I don't understand.

674
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,200
There's nothing incriminating
on this video.

675
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,040
It's hard to understand
these serious allegations.

676
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,240
Would you explain this to our audience?

677
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,800
Looks like, uh… Salvator is speechless.

678
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,840
We'll return in a moment.
Please, stay with us.

679
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,880
Fuckheads!

680
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,320
How much did he pay you?

681
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,680
- Get over it. I'm sick of conspiracies.
- You motherfucker!

682
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,200
[suspenseful music playing]

683
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,080
[groaning]

684
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,680
I don't give a shit!
Search the entire building. Find him!

685
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,000
[cell phone vibrates]

686
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,080
I'll call back.

687
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,560
Yes, sweetheart.

688
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,080
- [Juliette]<i> Hey, Daddy.</i>
- I told you, right?

689
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,640
It's all just lies.

690
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,120
I saw.

691
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
I'm sorry.

692
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,520
<i>I have to tell you something.</i>

693
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,720
This Salvator, um…

694
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,840
I think I know who it is.

695
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,640
What do you mean?
