[J'accuse whimpering]

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,200
It's my fault, Ben.

5
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,960
You were right.

6
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,720
I shouldn't have involved her.

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,800
About that…

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,720
I don't want to find you dead.

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,160
What should I do?

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,080
Should I quit?

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,880
Give up and let him win?

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,080
Or should I say, "Sorry. Sorry again
for the trouble, Mr. Pellegrini"?

13
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,560
"Sorry, sir."

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,640
Again!

15
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,600
[Benjamin] You have a life, Assane.

16
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,360
You have a wife and a son.

17
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,040
And his birthday is today.

[J'accuse whimpers]

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,280
I thought you had something planned.
You promised Raoul.

[Assane clicks tongue]

21
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,640
I don't feel like it.

22
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,040
Well, yeah, but if you don't,

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,400
then he's beat you.

27
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,520
He's very sweet.

28
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,240
Just don't mention you-know-who.

29
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
[Benjamin] Who?

30
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,760
- Pellegrini!

Youssef? Honestly, it's so shitty
you got pulled from the case.

33
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,360
It's not a big deal.

34
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,160
And besides, paperwork is my passion.

35
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,600
- All right, ciao.
- Ciao.

Okay.

39
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Who is this guy?

40
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,800
Luis Perenna,

41
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,440
Sernine.

42
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,480
The Louvre…

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,920
Okay, Sernine,<i> 813</i>, Perenna…

Of course, of course.
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

48
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,880
Wait, no, wait…

They've got nothing in forensics.

61
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,640
The guy robbed the Louvre,

62
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,840
and you've got basically nothing on him.

63
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,960
Either he's the luckiest guy in France…

64
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,800
- Or the greatest thief in the world.
- Don't you start!

65
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,360
Guédira had a lead.

66
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,400
Guédira's no longer on this case.
Don't make me take you off.

67
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,840
Okay, but where is he?

68
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,240
It's not like I fired him.

69
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,560
He texted me saying he was sick.

70
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,920
- Did he look sick to you yesterday?
- Honestly…

71
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,880
I think he always looks sick.

72
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,680
All right…

73
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,920
If this guy's in Paris,
we're gonna get him.

What have you been doing?

87
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,480
Oh, nothing.

88
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,200
- I missed my bus, so I ran here instead.
- Ah.

89
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,160
What's this?

90
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,240
Open it.

Oh, let me.

There you go.

There!

96
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,400
- Um, Assane, remember, he's 14.
- [Assane] So what?

97
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,320
You don't like it?

98
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,240
Well, I really like the Lupin books,

99
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,440
but I'm not so sure about this.

100
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,160
Well, I'm sure.
You're gonna love it. Trust me.

101
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,080
Because it's not over.
We gotta go or we'll be late.

102
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,160
We're late?

103
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,400
- Surprise!
- Okay, then, you boys have fun.

104
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,680
You're not coming with us?

105
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,760
Uh… No, no, no. I'm not coming.

106
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,080
I have plans.

107
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,480
Hmm… A doctor's appointment?

108
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
- Did you snitch on me?
- [Assane chuckles]

109
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,520
- If you wanna ask me a question, ask it!
- I don't have questions.

110
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,680
- Nothing to hide. What do you wanna know?
- If you're coming.

111
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,960
- The train leaves in an hour.
- What train?

112
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,240
Our train.

113
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800

115
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,960
You're a pain in the ass, Assane.

116
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,800
It's like you never leave me
any choice on these things.

117
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,040
[Assane] Mm-hm.

118
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,120
Mm-hm?

119
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,240
He never lets me know.

120
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,000
Even when he's three hours late
or blows me off.

121
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,280
Does this happen a lot?

122
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,800
[Claire sighs]

123
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,400
- Too focused on his work?
- What?

124
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,680
His work, yeah.
I guess you can call it that.

125
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,280
- [therapist] What does he do?
- Oh, it's better if you don't know.

126
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,720
Let's just say,

127
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,760
if you run into him on the street,
better watch your wallet.

128
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,120
Come to think of it,
I barely know what he does.

129
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,800
[policeman] 295, here.

130
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,760
[Assane] So, you're the two they sent?

131
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,960
- [woman] Yeah.
- [man] Yeah.

132
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,120
I got two of my guys on the inside.

133
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,920
You better check the windows.
The perp could sneak out.

134
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,080
They're still inside?

135
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,120
There are four of 'em. Three took off
on a scooter, one's inside. I'll get him.

136
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,360
- [woman] You don't want us to go with you?
- Kid on foot. I can manage.

137
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,600
- You two check the windows.
- You got it.

138
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,680
Thank you.

- Good afternoon, ma'am. It's the police.

141
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,440
- Can you open up, please?
- [woman]<i> Who is it?</i>

142
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,600
It's the police.

143
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,960
- [woman] <i>Right, come in.</i>
- Thank you very much.

144
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,760
No need to worry. I have two of my cops
standing guard downstairs.

145
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,040
Everything will be fine. You're safe now.

146
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,640
See?

147
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,080
Did they take anything?

148
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,520
I… don't think so, no.

149
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,280
You're lucky because the apartment
downstairs was totally cleaned out.

150
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,440
They took everything.

151
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,840
- [woman] Really?
- Oh, yeah.

152
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,080
- Do you have an alarm system?
- [woman] No.

153
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,160
Oh, no. That's not good, ma'am.

154
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,440
Not at all.

155
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,240
They're going to come back.

156
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,800
Oh, you think so?

157
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,920
Oh, I know so!

158
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,920
These guys will never stop.

159
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,400
If they haven't finished the job,
they'll come back,

160
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,520
stuff their pockets and take everything.

161
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,880
But you'll stay, right?

162
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,160
No, ma'am.

163
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,800
I can't stay here.

164
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,920
It's not possible.

165
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,680
We're understaffed. Most of us
are sent to the bad neighborhoods.

166
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,920
- There's nothing left for the good folks.
- My God!

167
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
That's right. Tell me about it!

168
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,880
- There might be a solution.
- Yes, tell me.

169
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,200
It's complicated.

170
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,080
Please, tell me.

171
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,160
If you have some items of real value,
leave them with me.

172
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,920
Yeah, I think it's for the best.
Leave them with me.

173
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,280
I'll put 'em in the station,
safe and sound, in the evidence room.

174
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,680
They'll be safe.

175
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,840
And then you'll pick 'em up
after we finally catch these guys.

176
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,000
Yes. Let's do that.

177
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,200
It'll mean a lot of paperwork for me, but…

178
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,160
Oh, will you? Please!

179
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,720
[Assane chuckles softly]

180
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,360
All right.

181
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,080
Let's do it.

182
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,160
[woman chuckles]

183
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,480
Uh, ma'am…

184
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,400
Just the most valuable.

185
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,640
[clock chimes]

186
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,960
[Assane sighs]

187
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,480
[door opens]

188
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,040
Ah, there it is.

189
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,240
My husband gave these ones to me.

190
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,160
He assisted with the extraction
of diamonds in the Belgian Congo.

191
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,880
- The good old days.
- The locals were sitting on a fortune.

192
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,400
They didn't even realize it.

193
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,760
- We just helped ourselves.
- Their loss, right?

194
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,840
[woman] Hmm.

195
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,480
- Should I take the earrings too?
- Oh! Yes, please.

196
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,000
[woman] Thank you. I…

197
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,720
I have one last favor to ask you.

198
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,920
I have a Fabergé egg.

199
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,840
Huh? You do?

200
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,800
But, ma'am, I can't take it all.

201
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,280
For me?

202
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,360
- You drive a hard bargain.
- I know.

203
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,440
All right.

204
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,760
- A souvenir from the Belgian Congo.
- Thank you.

205
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,360
- [Assane chuckles]
- Oh!

206
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,840
You are a gentleman.

207
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,560
[Assane laughs]

208
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,720
- [therapist]This man's your soulmate?
- "Soulmate" might be a bit of a stretch.

209
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,800
[therapist] Well, those are your words.

210
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,880
During our last session, you said to me,

211
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,360
"Assane is made for me,
whether I like it or not."

212
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,600
"He's my soulmate."

213
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,400
So, you believe in soulmates?

214
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,240
[lighter clicks]

215
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,200
[Claire]<i> Let's just say
when I'm in his arms and he's holding me,</i>

216
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,640
I can believe that.

217
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,080
When I'm exhausted, I've made dinner,
and he's three hours late,

218
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,480
it's more complicated.

219
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,280
[ticking]

220
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,520
[Claire]
<i>I keep telling myself it'll get better,</i>

221
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,160
<i>and there are moments…</i>

222
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,240
[Claire sighs]

223
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,680
…when it's good.

224
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,720
We talk about the future and…

225
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,960
All of a sudden,
it's like he can't help himself.

226
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,240
He does something that could ruin it.

227
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,880
A vicious cycle?

228
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,240
[Claire]<i> I'm not sure
I'm even in love with him because…</i>

229
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,440
<i>we've been together for so long.</i>

230
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,560
We have fun, we've…
we've been through so much.

231
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,360
<i>He's my best friend, but…</i>

232
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,040
I don't think he's my soulmate.

233
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,760
You don't owe him anything.

234
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,160
You're not married.
You don't have children.

235
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,280
[alarm rings]

236
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,760
[Claire]<i> I'll talk to him tonight.</i>

237
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,520
And I guess we'll…

238
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,200
Well, we'll see.

239
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,440
You'll see what?

240
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,920
If he cares about me.

241
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,280
[door buzzes]

242
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,240
[distant horn blares]

243
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,520
- Can you believe it?
- [woman] Ah!

244
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,200
- You didn't see him?
- [woman] No.

245
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,960
- [Assane] He got out through the roof.
- Shit, damn it!

246
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,400
- You didn't see him up on the roof?
- [woman] No.

247
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,080
We don't even get paid enough
for this shit. I mean, am I right?

248
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,880
He dropped this making his escape.

249
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,160
- Wow, look at that.
- Yeah.

250
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,920
- Not bad.
- Tell me about it!

251
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,200
I'm taking this to the station
as evidence.

252
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,600
- Okay.
- I'll do the paperwork.

253
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,480
- There goes my afternoon.
- Thank you.

254
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,120
- It's my pleasure.
- Thank you.

255
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,480
- Have a good day.
- Yeah.

256
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,680
Bye! Thanks for having my back.
You'll look good in my report.

257
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,760
- Take care.
- Yeah.

258
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,320
- Don't work too hard. Goodbye!
- [woman] Thank you.

259
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,560
[Claire]
Hey, can we see each other tonight?

260
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,360
We need to talk.

261
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,480
What do you mean, I sound serious?

262
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,560
No.

263
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,000
This is how I talk.

264
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,960
It's important.

265
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,800
Can we get some dinner?

266
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,920
Seven o'clock, okay.
But pick a quiet place, Assane.

267
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,520
Not too much, okay?

268
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,720
Okay. See you.

269
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,200
[indistinct PA announcement]

270
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,400
[whistle blows]

271
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,240
- [Claire] Which seat, Assane?
- [Assane] Eighty-five.

272
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,680
Eighty-four, eighty-five, eighty-six…

273
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,280
- Here it is.
- [Claire] Here?

274
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,080
- Yeah.
- Okay, looks good.

275
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,000
[train horn blows]

276
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,400
You know, Le Havre, it's not so great.

277
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,560
We're not going there.

278
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,000
- We're not? Where are we going?
- Under the Fréfossé fortress.

279
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,400
[Claire] Ah!

280
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,160
"Downstream from Étretat,
the maidens' room."

281
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,160
"Under the Fréfossé fort."

282
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,040
- "The hollow needle."
- Exactly.

283
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,720
We're going to Étretat.

284
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,520
- There's an Arsène Lupin celebration.
- Oh, yeah. That's why I love you.

285
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,280
- [Claire laughs]
- You see?

286
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,760
Well, yeah.
I've known this man for 25 years.

287
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,080
Of course, when I met him,
he asked me to read <i>The Hollow Needle</i>.

288
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,880
Obviously, I remember some of it.

289
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,600
- Some of it?
- Some of it.

290
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,720
Hang on.
Two feet on the letters in the stone.

291
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,080
Measure 19 fathoms.

292
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,800
Then turn the cross.

293
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,720
Then you must climb
to the top of the 44th step.

294
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,200
Then, on the 357th,

295
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,520
you will find…

296
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,680
[Claire and Assane]
…the treasure of Arsène Lupin!

297
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,120
[all laugh]

298
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,760
You guys are totally crazy.

299
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,080
- [Claire laughs]
- Yeah, crazy, but connected.

300
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,320
- [Benjamin] This place is okay.
- It better be.

301
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,640
We're here to celebrate.

302
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,640
- I thought you were scouting the location.
- [chuckling] I told you.

303
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,720
The more money there is…

304
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,920
The bigger the patsies are. I know.

305
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,560
I found the perfect place for my shop.

306
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,320
A large ground floor space
in the flea market

307
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,040
for the clients who are normal,

308
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,440
and a basement for the clients…
who aren't normal.

309
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,680
Closest police station?

310
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,760
Not close.

311
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,640
That's perfect.

312
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,240
- I know.
- We're good.

313
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,320
[jazz music playing]

314
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,040
First sale for the shop.

315
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,680
- A Fabergé?
- Of course. Why not?

316
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,920
[Benjamin chuckles]

317
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,880
We're on our way, my friend.

318
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,160
[Benjamin clears throat]

319
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,360
[footsteps]

320
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,760
[Benjamin]
Ah! I've just figured out why we're here.

321
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,440
- That's not why.
- Yeah.

322
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,080
I'll be right back.

323
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,480
[Benjamin sighs]

324
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,640
[Assane and Juliette laugh]

325
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,000
You gotta stop following me.

326
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,280
[Juliette laughs]

327
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,360
Are you kidding me?

328
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,520
You're following me.

329
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,200
Why are you here?

330
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,160
You look good.

331
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,080
[chuckles] You know I'm taken.

332
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,560
[chuckling] And that's a problem?

333
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,640
It never used to be.

334
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,360
- It was a mistake.
- Why are you second-guessing this?

335
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,080
- Does it look like I am?
- No, and that's the problem.

336
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
Oh, it's a problem?

337
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,960
Then it's a big problem.

338
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,360
[Juliette laughs]

339
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,560
[Assane laughs]

340
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,160
- I can't keep doing this to Claire.
- Claire?

341
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,280
[Juliette laughs]

342
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,880
Even her name sounds boring.

343
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,360
I can't imagine the rest.

344
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,200
I'm a good guy, Juliette.

345
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,240
Oh, no. No, not at all.

346
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,960
You're not a good guy at all.

347
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,240
That's what I like.

348
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,760
- No.
- [scoffs]

349
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,680
I see…

350
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,000
I won't keep waiting for you.

351
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,600
Well, you could stop waiting.

352

00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,920
Don't move! Put your hands up!

530
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,560
I said hands up!

531
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,840
Hands out. Take your hands out!

532
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,360
Beige raincoat, that's him.

533
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,520
- Now you do.
- [policeman] I said take your hands out!

534
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,800
Get on the ground!

535
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,040
Go on, easy.

536
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,200
There we go.

537
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,120
What's this?

538
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,240
He's got a gun.

539
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,800
What's in your pockets?

540
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,400
What's this?

541
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,040
[seagulls crying]

542
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,480
[Claire]
So, what happens to Lupin in the end?

543
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,600
Nobody knows. He never got caught.

544
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:48,480
That proves it's fiction. In real life,
Lupin would get caught right away.

545
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,320
Unless he knew when to stop.

546
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,560
Ah!

547
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,200
- [Claire] Oh!
- [Assane] Ah!

548
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,400
- [Claire and Assane laugh]
- All right!

549
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,280
Anywhere else, it'd look ridiculous.

550
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,720
- But here, it's cool.
- Yeah, I agree.

551
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,880
- I'll be back.
- Wait. Where are you going?

552
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,920
- [Raoul] To see the needle rock.
- [Claire] Don't go too far.

553
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,280
[Assane] So, when are you due?

554
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,040
I think around 11th December.

555
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,200
No?

556
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,320
Yeah. Is that a problem?

557
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,640
What?

558
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,440
Well, December 11th!

559
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,520
Claire, December 11th
is Maurice Leblanc's birthday!

560
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,600
Ah!

561
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,000
- Okay, so what are you saying?
- It's a sign!

562
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,080
- Don't say you want to name him Maurice?
- [Assane] Well, why not?

563
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,360
No, not Maurice.

564
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,040
[Assane laughs]

565
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,520
No, not Maurice, but Assane Junior.

566
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,320
- Assane Junior?
- Yeah.

567
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,200
- Are you crazy?
- I know that's a no.

568
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,280
Arsène.

569
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,880
No, not Arsène.

570
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,920
I don't know what his name will be,

571
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,680
but I'll love him.

572
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,400
And I'll protect him any way I can.

573
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,960
So, no more fuck-ups?

574
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,720
[Assane] No more fuck-ups.

575
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,360
I promise.

576
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,040
Got it.

577
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,240
- Raoul.
- Raoul?

578
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,240
- [laughing] Yeah!
- No, not Raoul!

579
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,280
- [Assane] Raoul is good, right?
- [Claire] No! No!

580
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,240
[Claire] Assane,

581
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,240
who was that guy on the train?

582
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,960
What was that about?

583
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,160
Stop.

584
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,880
I knew it was weird.

585
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,760
I'm not an idiot.

586
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,200
Assane!

587
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,760
Answer me!

588
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,720
I'm sorting something out, Claire.

589
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,720
Something important to me. And Raoul too.

590
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,920
It's about my dad.

591
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,040
Who you refused to talk about
for 25 years, who I know nothing about!

592
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:15,280
- What does that have to do with anything?
- I must finish this, then I can tell you.

593
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,640
Then no more secrets.

594
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,080
I know I've said this so many times.

595
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,680
- So, why should you...
- Yeah.

596
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,760
I know you have no reason to believe me.

597
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,280
- But this time, it's true.
- It's true.

598
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,640
I know. This time, it's true, as usual.

599
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,560
You've told me that a hundred times,
but it's… it's really not enough.

600
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,880
Assane, I need more.

601
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,640
And you have nothing to say.

602
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,800
But that's not what matters
right now, Claire.

603
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,520
What matters is Raoul and you.

604
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,240
Give me a chance.

605
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,080
One more.

606
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,080
Hang on. Where's Raoul?

607
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,880
I don't see him.

608
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,920
Raoul?

609
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,920
[Belkacem] That's not our guy.

610
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:15,320
He had a stone from the necklace.
Bring him back to Paris and question him.

611
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,160
- Where are you going?
- We're getting Sernine at Le Havre.

612
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,160
You're one step behind.
They let the guy go. It wasn't him.

613
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,240
- But he had the gem.
- And he was armed.

614
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,800
He has a gun license, and an alibi
for the night of the burglary.

615
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,320
So, the stone…

616
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,480
Someone put it in his pocket. That's all.

617
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,680
- Whoa! Wait a minute.
- Wait? Wait for what?

618
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,520
For us to waste two weeks
on more false leads?

619
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,880
The guy was clearly framed.
So, now we figure out who framed him.

620
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,240
Go through the list of train passengers.

621
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,440
Recover the surveillance footage. Okay?

622
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,520
Just do your fucking job.
I can't do everything!

623
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,440
What is this crap?
We can't even question him?

624
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,840
- This is fucking bullshit!
- What do you want me to say?

625
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,160
Get me the list of passengers
on the train.

626
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,480
There could be hundreds.
It'll take forever.

627
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,480
Guédira should be doing this.
Where the fuck is he?

628
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,880
Raoul!

629
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,560
[Claire] Raoul!

630
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,960
Raoul!

631
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,400
[children shouting]

632
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,120
[ringing tone]

633
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,680
[Raoul] <i>Hey, leave a message.</i>

634
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,160
[child screams]

635
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,840
[children shouting]

636
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,640
Excuse me. Excuse me.

637
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,120
Have you seen a 14-year-old boy,
light brown skin, wearing a top hat?

638
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,040
[inaudible]

639
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,520
Light brown skin, with curly hair? No?

640
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,840
[indistinct chatter]

641
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,840
[laughter]

642
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,120
[seagulls crying]

643
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,520
[Raoul groans]

644
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,560
[Claire] Raoul!

645
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,960
[tires screech]

646
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,720
[Guédira] Lupin?
