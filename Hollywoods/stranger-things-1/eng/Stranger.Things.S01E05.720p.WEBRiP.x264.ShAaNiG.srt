00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:19,883
[door beeps]

2
00:00:19,909 --> 00:00:21,135
[woman] Thanks.

3
00:00:35,758 --> 00:00:37,192
[indistinct chatter]

4
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:40,279

00:01:00,074 --> 00:01:01,216
[sighs]

7
00:01:10,751 --> 00:01:12,001
[doorknob rattling]

8
00:01:12,002 --> 00:01:13,795
- No.
- [bangs door]

9
00:01:13,796 --> 00:01:15,106
[sighs]

10
00:01:17,675 --> 00:01:19,884
- [gun cocking]
- Hands up. Hands up!

11
00:01:19,885 --> 00:01:22,679
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,555
Forgot all the cameras, bub?

13
00:01:24,556 --> 00:01:27,517
Look, Dr. Brenner asked for
me specifically. Okay?

14
00:01:27,518 --> 00:01:28,981
How else do you think I got in here?

15
00:01:28,982 --> 00:01:30,125
[Hopper scoffs]

16
00:01:30,437 --> 00:01:31,646
What's your name again?

17
00:01:31,647 --> 00:01:33,439
It's Jim Hopper.

18
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,233
Chief Jim Hopper.

19
00:01:35,234 --> 00:01:37,211
Yeah, I've got Jim Hopper... [grunts]

20
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,255
- [man on radio] Come again?
- [grunts]

21
00:01:41,198 --> 00:01:42,782
[both panting]

22
00:01:42,783 --> 00:01:44,826
[indistinct radio chatter]

23
00:01:44,827 --> 00:01:46,494
Hey...

24
00:01:46,495 --> 00:01:48,097
you mind if I borrow this one?

25
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:50,516
- [beeps]
- [door buzzing]

26
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:55,479
[door locks]

27
00:01:59,008 --> 00:02:01,467
- [liquid pouring]
- [Lonnie] Drink.

28
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:02,861
It'll calm your nerves.

29
00:02:04,221 --> 00:02:06,198
Help you think straight, yeah?

30
00:02:10,853 --> 00:02:12,830
I don't know what to do.

31
00:02:14,106 --> 00:02:15,666
I know. I know.

32
00:02:16,984 --> 00:02:19,336
[sniffs] This whole time...

33
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,657
I... I could... I could feel him.

34
00:02:24,658 --> 00:02:26,051
He was...

35
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:29,120
He was so close. He
was... he was right there.

36
00:02:29,121 --> 00:02:31,956
- I knew he was alive.
- [thunder rumbles]

37
00:02:31,957 --> 00:02:36,836
Our hands... our
hands were almost touching.

38
00:02:36,837 --> 00:02:39,940
Now it's like I... uh...

39
00:02:41,383 --> 00:02:44,236
[sobbing] God, it's like
I can't feel him anymore.

40
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,348
- Don't look at me like that.
- Like what?

41
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:50,475
Like how everybody is looking at me.

42
00:02:50,476 --> 00:02:52,495
- Like I'm out of my damn mind.
- Hey.

43
00:02:55,314 --> 00:02:56,439
You're not gonna like this,

44
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,169
but I think you need to seriously
consider the possibility that all this...

45
00:03:02,404 --> 00:03:03,529
It's in your head.

46
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,923
[scoffs]

47
00:03:05,949 --> 00:03:08,034
- You remember your Aunt Darlene?
- No.

48
00:03:08,035 --> 00:03:11,079
No, this is not that.

49
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,703
I mean, when something
like this happens,

50
00:03:12,704 --> 00:03:15,849
your mind makes up stuff
for you to cope, you know?

51
00:03:16,668 --> 00:03:19,051
I mean, Jesus, there's a
funeral tomorrow for our little boy

52
00:03:19,052 --> 00:03:21,071
and you're saying his body is fake.

53
00:03:22,174 --> 00:03:23,567
He's in the wall.

54
00:03:24,176 --> 00:03:26,236
I mean, how do you explain that?

55
00:03:28,013 --> 00:03:30,640
- [stammers]
- It just doesn't make sense. It doesn't.

56
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:34,435
- At least go talk to a shrink or...
- [sighs]

57
00:03:34,436 --> 00:03:37,563
- What about Pastor Charles or someone...
- I don't... Well, they can't help.

58
00:03:37,564 --> 00:03:39,541
Joyce, you just told me...

59
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:41,877
that Will is gone.

60
00:03:43,862 --> 00:03:46,923
- What else is there to do?
- [sniffles]

61
00:03:50,202 --> 00:03:51,470
Hey.

62
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,603
[sniffles]

63
00:04:05,342 --> 00:04:07,235
[Hopper] Will?

64
00:04:08,429 --> 00:04:09,697
Will?

65
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,366
Will?

66
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:16,537
Will?

67
00:04:36,874 --> 00:04:39,333
[Mike] What was Will saying?

68
00:04:39,334 --> 00:04:41,645
Like home... Like home...

69
00:04:42,963 --> 00:04:44,523
but dark?

70
00:04:45,424 --> 00:04:46,859
[Lucas] And empty.

71
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:52,388
[sighs] Empty and
cold. Wait, did he say cold?

72
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:55,558
I don't know. The stupid radio
kept going in and out.

73
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:57,102
[sighs] It's like riddles in the dark.

74
00:04:57,103 --> 00:04:59,020
Like home. Like his house?

75
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:00,354
Or maybe like Hawkins.

76
00:05:00,355 --> 00:05:01,981
Upside down.

77
00:05:01,982 --> 00:05:04,317
- What'd she say?
- Upside down.

78
00:05:04,318 --> 00:05:05,961
- [Lucas] What?
- Upside down.

79
00:05:06,862 --> 00:05:10,823
When El showed us where Will was, she
flipped the board over, remember?

80
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:12,867
Upside down.

81
00:05:12,868 --> 00:05:14,577
Dark. Empty.

82
00:05:14,578 --> 00:05:16,996
Do you understand what
he's talking about?

83
00:05:16,997 --> 00:05:18,998
- No.
- [Mike] Guys, come on, think about it.

84
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:22,126
When El took us to find Will, she
took us to his house, right?

85
00:05:22,127 --> 00:05:24,003
Yeah. And he wasn't there.

86
00:05:24,004 --> 00:05:25,797
But what if he was there?

87
00:05:25,798 --> 00:05:27,840
What if we just couldn't see him?

88
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:29,902
What if he was on the other side?

89
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:34,156
What if this is Hawkins and...

90
00:05:35,516 --> 00:05:36,807
this is where Will is?

91
00:05:36,808 --> 00:05:38,518
The Upside Down.

92
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:40,329
Like the Vale of Shadows.

93
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:43,707
[Hopper] Will?

94
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,294
- Will?
- [alarm blaring faintly]

95
00:05:50,405 --> 00:05:51,673
Will?

96
00:05:53,158 --> 00:05:55,052
[alarm continues]

97
00:05:59,456 --> 00:06:01,516

98
00:06:02,668 --> 00:06:04,436
[guards yelling]

99
00:06:07,214 --> 00:06:09,358
I see him! Hey! Stop!

100
00:06:15,722 --> 00:06:17,306
[Dustin] "The Vale of Shadows

101
00:06:17,307 --> 00:06:21,661
is a dimension that is a dark
reflection or echo of our world.

102
00:06:27,317 --> 00:06:30,695
It is a place of decay and death."

103
00:06:30,696 --> 00:06:32,113
[Hopper] Will?

104
00:06:32,114 --> 00:06:36,093
"A plane out of
phase. A place of monsters.

105
00:06:38,412 --> 00:06:40,913
It is right next to you, and
you don't even see it."

106
00:06:40,914 --> 00:06:43,391
- [electricity crackling]
- [Hopper coughing] Will?

107
00:06:45,127 --> 00:06:46,544
Will?

108
00:06:46,545 --> 00:06:48,647
An alternate dimension.

109
00:06:49,548 --> 00:06:51,549
But... how... how do we get there?

110
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,675
You cast Shadow Walk.

111
00:06:52,676 --> 00:06:54,051
In real life, dummy.

112
00:06:54,052 --> 00:06:56,154
We can't shadow walk, but...

113
00:06:57,014 --> 00:06:58,532
maybe she can.

114
00:07:00,225 --> 00:07:02,994
Do you know how we get
there? To the Upside Down?

115
00:07:05,981 --> 00:07:07,749
[sighing] Oh, my God!

116
00:07:14,406 --> 00:07:16,383
[coughing]

00:07:18,702 --> 00:07:20,429
[exclaims softly]

118
00:07:22,122 --> 00:07:23,640
What the hell?

119
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,643
[rhythmic pulsing]

120

Hey, kid.

127
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,459
What's going on?

128
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,629
Your dad's, uh, gonna stay here
tonight. [stammers] On the couch.

129
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,757
[Lonnie] Yeah, I'm here as
long as you need me, okay?

130
00:09:37,758 --> 00:09:39,651
How are you holding up?

131
00:09:43,138 --> 00:09:44,388
What happened?

132
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:46,116
- Don't worry about that.
- Mom...

133
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:49,810
that thing you saw
before, did it come back?

134
00:09:49,811 --> 00:09:52,605
Jonathan, that's enough.

135
00:09:52,606 --> 00:09:54,398
[sighs]

136
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,108
Can we talk?

137
00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:57,377
Alone?

138
00:09:58,111 --> 00:10:00,404
- You need to leave.
- Look, I know you're upset.

139
00:10:00,405 --> 00:10:02,073
We all are.

140
00:10:02,074 --> 00:10:06,243
But you need to listen to me. Your
mother is sick. Really sick.

141
00:10:06,244 --> 00:10:07,828
Yeah. Well, you being here,

142
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:09,121
you're just making
things worse, like always.

143
00:10:09,122 --> 00:10:10,247
- Worse?
- Yeah!

144
00:10:10,248 --> 00:10:12,291
She took down that wall with an ax.

145
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:14,635
She said that Will was
inside and that he's talking to her.

146
00:10:14,636 --> 00:10:16,045
Yeah. Maybe he was.

147
00:10:16,046 --> 00:10:17,880
This isn't some kind of joke.

148
00:10:17,881 --> 00:10:19,965
Your mom was half frozen
to death when I got here.

149
00:10:19,966 --> 00:10:21,425
Trembling, scared out of her mind.

150
00:10:21,426 --> 00:10:23,761
You come in here and you start
feeding into her hallucinations

151
00:10:23,762 --> 00:10:25,385
or whatever the hell
you want to call it,

152
00:10:25,386 --> 00:10:27,167
you're gonna push her
right over the edge.

153
00:10:27,682 --> 00:10:29,075
You hear me?

154
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:34,438
[sighs] Look, I'm on your side.

155
00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:35,832
I'm here to help.

156
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,833
I'm gonna make things
better around here for all of us.

157
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:41,645
[scoffs] Thank God you're here.

158
00:10:43,031 --> 00:10:45,759
Do me a favor. At the
funeral tomorrow, just behave.

159
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:48,553
If not for me, for your mother.

160
00:10:52,457 --> 00:10:56,019
Take that down. It's inappropriate.

161
00:11:04,344 --> 00:11:06,887
- Good.
- Ah! Dad, you're... you're choking me.

162
00:11:06,888 --> 00:11:09,699
Ah... there. It's supposed
to be a little tight.

163
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,851
Looks good.

164
00:11:11,852 --> 00:11:14,329
- [zipper closing]
- Here we go. [sighs]

165
00:11:15,689 --> 00:11:17,415
You look nice, sweetie.

166
00:11:20,193 --> 00:11:21,735
Anything else?

167
00:11:21,736 --> 00:11:23,696
You can borrow my
black heels if you want.

168
00:11:23,697 --> 00:11:25,614
The ones you wore to Cathy's birthday.

169
00:11:25,615 --> 00:11:28,009
I'm fine. Thanks.

170
00:11:36,084 --> 00:11:37,560
[whimpering]

171
00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:55,704
Ugh.

172
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,286
Come on. Time to go.

173
00:12:12,287 --> 00:12:13,888
[groans softly]

174
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,018
- Come on.
- [sighs]

175
00:12:19,711 --> 00:12:22,963
[Pastor Charles] "Fear
not, for I am with you.

176
00:12:22,964 --> 00:12:25,734
Be not dismayed, for I am your God.

177
00:12:27,302 --> 00:12:28,677
I will strengthen you.

178
00:12:28,678 --> 00:12:30,930
Yes, I will help you.

179
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:34,701
I will uphold you with
my righteous right hand."

00:12:35,977 --> 00:12:39,164
It's times like these that
our faith is challenged.

181
00:12:40,106 --> 00:12:42,792
How, if He is truly benevolent...

182
00:12:43,652 --> 00:12:47,130
could God take from us someone
so young, so innocent?

183
00:12:48,365 --> 00:12:51,051
It would be easy to
turn away from God...

184
00:12:52,035 --> 00:12:54,370
but we must remember that nothing,

185
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:57,081
not even tragedy, can
separate us from His love.

186
00:12:57,082 --> 00:13:00,167
We are here today to find
comfort in the truth of scripture,

187
00:13:00,168 --> 00:13:02,503
- and to surround Will and his family...
- [sniffles]

188
00:13:02,504 --> 00:13:04,396
Just wait till we
tell Will that Jennifer

189
00:13:04,397 --> 00:13:05,923
Hayes was crying at his funeral.

190
00:13:05,924 --> 00:13:07,317
[shushes]

191
00:13:15,976 --> 00:13:19,144
- [Karen] I'm so, so sorry.
- Oh, thank you so much for coming.

192
00:13:19,145 --> 00:13:21,313
Yeah, if there's anything we can do...

193
00:13:21,314 --> 00:13:23,458
I appreciate it. Thank you so much.

194
00:13:24,859 --> 00:13:26,711
Take care, all right? Thanks.

195
00:13:27,654 --> 00:13:29,297
Thanks for coming out.

196
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,352
I see Will the Wise is back.

197
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:46,964
What's that shooting out of his cane?

198
00:13:46,965 --> 00:13:48,465
Fireballs.

199
00:13:48,466 --> 00:13:50,843
I couldn't find the red
crayon, so that's why it's green.

200
00:13:50,844 --> 00:13:51,969
Oh, well...

201
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:55,097
if he's so wise, why
does he need fireballs?

202
00:13:55,098 --> 00:13:58,409
Why can't he just, you
know, outsmart the bad guys?

203
00:13:59,352 --> 00:14:01,103
Most of the time, yeah, totally.

204
00:14:01,104 --> 00:14:04,481
But... sometimes the
bad guys are smart, too.

205
00:14:04,482 --> 00:14:05,583
You know?

206
00:14:06,026 --> 00:14:07,109
Yeah.

207
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,153
So he needs the fireballs?

208
00:14:09,154 --> 00:14:12,031
Well, yeah, to burn them to a crisp.

209
00:14:12,032 --> 00:14:14,533
All right. Well, I don't
know who's been raising you,

210
00:14:14,534 --> 00:14:17,036
but I'm gonna get you some new crayons

211
00:14:17,037 --> 00:14:20,039
because it looks like
he's shooting cabbages.

212
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,391
[both chuckle]

213
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,563
[gasping]

214
00:14:31,217 --> 00:14:33,027
[breathing heavily]

215
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:48,168
[panting]

216
00:15:12,634 --> 00:15:14,569
[dishes clattering]

217
00:16:02,267 --> 00:16:03,701
[exclaims]

218
00:16:10,859 --> 00:16:12,778
[Lucas] Will! Will,
it's us! Are you there?

219
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:14,278
[Dustin] Can you hear us? We're here!

220
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:16,655
[Will distorted] Hello? Mom?

221
00:16:16,656 --> 00:16:19,550
- [Lucas] Why can't he hear us?
- [Mike] I don't know!

222
00:16:19,576 --> 00:16:21,970
[Will distorted] Mom, it's coming!

223
00:16:23,246 --> 00:16:25,247
She was there.

224
00:16:25,248 --> 00:16:27,040
[church bell tolling]

225
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,877
This is where we know for
sure it's been, right?

226
00:16:29,878 --> 00:16:32,421
- So, that's...
- Steve's house.

227
00:16:32,422 --> 00:16:35,048
And that's the woods where
they found Will's bike and...

228
00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:36,216
that's my house.

229
00:16:36,217 --> 00:16:39,178
- It's all so close.
- Yeah. Exactly.

230
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:41,638
I mean, it's all within
a mile or something.

231
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:45,034
Whatever this thing is,
it's... it's not traveling far.

232
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:48,037
You want to go out there.

233
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,897
We might not find anything.

234
00:16:49,898 --> 00:16:51,332
I found something.

235
00:16:54,569 --> 00:16:57,213
And if we do see it...

236
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:01,301
then what?

237
00:17:01,326 --> 00:17:02,468
[sighs]

238
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,139
We kill it.

239
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,435
- What are you doing?
- Just give me a second.

240
00:17:20,011 --> 00:17:21,595
Are you serious?

241
00:17:21,596 --> 00:17:26,075
What? You want to find this thing
and take another photo? Yell at it?

242
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,312
This is a terrible idea.

243
00:17:30,313 --> 00:17:32,940
Yeah, well, it's the best we've got.

244
00:17:32,941 --> 00:17:35,943
What? You can tell someone, but
they're not gonna believe you.

245
00:17:35,944 --> 00:17:37,027
You know that.

246
00:17:37,028 --> 00:17:38,362
Your mom would.

247
00:17:38,363 --> 00:17:40,948
- She's been through enough.
- She deserves to know.

248
00:17:40,949 --> 00:17:42,407
Yeah, and I'll tell her...

249
00:17:42,408 --> 00:17:43,885
when this thing is dead.

250
00:17:48,331 --> 00:17:50,499
I don't know what in
the world caused it.

251
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,751
- Let's take a look, huh?
- Yeah.

252
00:17:52,752 --> 00:17:55,504
Mr. Clarke says he's never
seen anything like it.

253
00:17:55,505 --> 00:17:56,648
Mr. Clarke?

254
00:17:57,465 --> 00:17:59,633
Yeah, he runs the AV Club.

255
00:17:59,634 --> 00:18:00,842
[repairman] That right?

256
00:18:00,843 --> 00:18:04,321
Apparently, some of the less athletic
types go nuts for this stuff.

257
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:11,621
[engine starting]

258
00:18:20,822 --> 00:18:22,674
[indistinct chatter]

259
00:18:39,173 --> 00:18:40,924
[Mike] Mr. Clarke?

260
00:18:40,925 --> 00:18:42,652
Oh, hey, there.

261
00:18:43,386 --> 00:18:44,845
How are you boys holding up?

262
00:18:44,846 --> 00:18:46,555
[munching]

263
00:18:46,556 --> 00:18:49,057
We're... in... mourning.

264
00:18:49,058 --> 00:18:51,893
Man, these aren't real Nilla Wafers.

265
00:18:51,894 --> 00:18:54,271
[Mike] We were
wondering if you had time to talk?

266
00:18:54,272 --> 00:18:57,524
- We have some questions.
- A lot of questions.

267
00:18:57,525 --> 00:19:00,527
So, you know how in Cosmos, Carl Sagan
talks about other dimensions?

268
00:19:00,528 --> 00:19:01,737
Like, beyond our world?

269
00:19:01,738 --> 00:19:03,322
Yeah, sure. Theoretically.

270
00:19:03,323 --> 00:19:04,489
Right, theoretically.

271
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,159
So, theoretically, how
do we travel there?

272
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,503
You guys have been thinking about

273
00:19:08,504 --> 00:19:10,764
Hugh Everett's Many-Worlds
Interpretation, haven't you?

274
00:19:12,749 --> 00:19:15,334
Well, basically, there
are parallel universes.

275
00:19:15,335 --> 00:19:16,835
Just like our world,

276
00:19:16,836 --> 00:19:19,397
but just infinite variations of it.

277
00:19:20,256 --> 00:19:21,819
Which means there's a world out there

278
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,643
where none of this tragic
stuff ever happened.

279
00:19:23,644 --> 00:19:25,552
Yeah, that's not what
we're talking about.

280
00:19:25,553 --> 00:19:27,179
- Oh.
- We were thinking of more

281
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,043
of an evil dimension, like
the Vale of Shadows.

282
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:30,432
You know the Vale of Shadows?

283
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:33,016
An echo of the Material Plane,
where necrotic and shadow magic...

284
00:19:33,017 --> 00:19:34,019
[Mike] Yeah, exactly.

285
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,480
If that did exist, a place
like the Vale of Shadows,

286
00:19:36,481 --> 00:19:37,898
how would we travel there?

287
00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:39,876
- Theoretically.
- [Mr. Clarke] Well...

288
00:19:44,739 --> 00:19:47,425
Picture... an acrobat...

289
00:19:48,576 --> 00:19:49,868
standing on a tightrope.

290
00:19:49,869 --> 00:19:52,579
Now, the tightrope is our dimension.

291
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,123
And our dimension has rules.

292
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:58,060
You can move forwards, or backwards.

293
00:19:58,503 --> 00:20:00,128
But, what if...

294
00:20:00,129 --> 00:20:04,341
right next to our
acrobat, there is a flea?

295
00:20:04,342 --> 00:20:07,552
Now, the flea can also travel back
and forth, just like the acrobat.

296
00:20:07,553 --> 00:20:08,929
- Right?
- Right.

297
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:11,306
Here's where things get
really interesting.

298
00:20:11,307 --> 00:20:13,684
The flea can also travel this way...

299
00:20:13,685 --> 00:20:15,894
along the side of the rope.

300
00:20:15,895 --> 00:20:17,622
He can even go...

301
00:20:18,481 --> 00:20:19,773
underneath the rope.

302
00:20:19,774 --> 00:20:22,067
- [boys] Upside down.
- Exactly.

303
00:20:22,068 --> 00:20:24,403
But we're not the
flea, we're the acrobat.

304
00:20:24,404 --> 00:20:26,738
In this metaphor,
yes, we're the acrobat.

305
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:28,407
So we can't go upside down?

306
00:20:28,408 --> 00:20:29,825
No.

307
00:20:29,826 --> 00:20:32,661
Well, is there any way for the
acrobat to get to the Upside Down?

308
00:20:32,662 --> 00:20:36,331
Well... you'd have to
create a massive amount of energy.

309
00:20:36,332 --> 00:20:39,209
More than humans are
currently capable of creating, mind you,

310
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,586
to open up some kind of
tear in time and space,

311
00:20:41,587 --> 00:20:42,897
and then...

312
00:20:48,845 --> 00:20:50,137
you create a doorway.

313
00:20:50,138 --> 00:20:52,889
- Like a gate?
- Sure. Like a gate.

314
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,767
- But again, this is all...
- Theoretical.

315
00:20:55,768 --> 00:20:58,311
But... but what if this
gate already existed?

316
00:20:58,312 --> 00:21:00,814
Well, if it did, I... I think we'd know.

317
00:21:00,815 --> 00:21:02,190
It would disrupt gravity,

318
00:21:02,191 --> 00:21:04,234
the magnetic field, our environment.

319
00:21:04,235 --> 00:21:06,754
Heck, it might even swallow us up whole.

320
00:21:08,114 --> 00:21:09,531
Science is neat.

321
00:21:09,532 --> 00:21:12,385
But I'm afraid it's not very forgiving.

322
00:21:23,796 --> 00:21:25,022
Whoa.

323
00:21:28,426 --> 00:21:29,610
Hey, Chief!

324
00:21:30,428 --> 00:21:32,321
- [knocking] Hello? Whoa!
- Hey!

325
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:36,600
- [Powell] Jesus, Chief. You all right?
- What are you doing here?

326
00:21:36,601 --> 00:21:40,371
- We tried calling, but...
- Yeah, the phone's dead.

327
00:21:41,856 --> 00:21:44,858
Hey, so Bev Mooney came
in this morning all upset.

328
00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:47,611
Said that Dale and
Henry went hunting yesterday...

329
00:21:47,612 --> 00:21:48,875
and they didn't come back home.

330
00:21:48,876 --> 00:21:53,439
She thought they were on another
binger, but she's not so sure now.

331
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:57,621
I think this whole Will Byers
thing has everybody on edge.

332
00:21:57,622 --> 00:21:59,331
- Where was this?
- It was at the station.

333
00:21:59,332 --> 00:22:01,333
No, no. Where did
Henry and Dale go hunting?

334
00:22:01,334 --> 00:22:03,311
Oh. Uh, out near Kerley.

335
00:22:03,711 --> 00:22:04,878
Mirkwood.

336
00:22:04,879 --> 00:22:06,230
What?

337
00:22:06,631 --> 00:22:08,048
Okay.

338
00:22:08,049 --> 00:22:10,860
You go back to the station. I'll
take care of this, all right?

339
00:22:11,302 --> 00:22:13,595
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, leave it.

340
00:22:13,596 --> 00:22:17,140
- Oh, hey. Uh, they found Barbara's car.
- What?

341
00:22:17,141 --> 00:22:20,143
Barbara Holland's car. Seems
she ran away after all.

342
00:22:20,144 --> 00:22:22,771
Staties found it late last
night at a bus station.

343
00:22:22,772 --> 00:22:25,916
Funny, right? They keep
doing our job for us.

344
00:22:27,568 --> 00:22:29,795
Yeah. [chuckles] It's funny.

345
00:22:31,656 --> 00:22:32,965
[door closes]

346
00:22:34,534 --> 00:22:36,910
- Is he off his meds again?
- [engine starts]

347
00:22:36,911 --> 00:22:39,621
He's been spending too
much time with Joyce Byers.

348
00:22:39,622 --> 00:22:40,973
That's what I think.

349
00:22:47,964 --> 00:22:50,090
[sighs] What are you doing?

350
00:22:50,091 --> 00:22:51,800
What does it look like I'm doing?

351
00:22:51,801 --> 00:22:53,461
You want to freeze to death all winter?

352
00:22:54,095 --> 00:22:55,446
[hammering continues]

353
00:22:56,305 --> 00:23:00,642
- I told you not to take these down.
- They were in the way, babe.

354
00:23:00,643 --> 00:23:03,120
How long are you gonna
keep those up? I mean, really?

355
00:23:07,817 --> 00:23:10,443
You know, it's a shame what
they've done to this family.

356
00:23:10,444 --> 00:23:12,320
- What?
- The Sattler Company.

357
00:23:12,321 --> 00:23:14,114
I went to the quarry
on the way over here.

358
00:23:14,115 --> 00:23:16,199
I just wanted to look around, you know?

359
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,803
Couldn't believe it. I
just couldn't believe it.

360
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:23,474
No warning signs, no fence, no nothing.

361
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:26,602
Ought to be held
accountable if you ask me.

362
00:23:30,881 --> 00:23:33,466
It would take a lot of
energy to build a gate like this.

363
00:23:33,467 --> 00:23:34,890
But that's got to be what happened.

364
00:23:34,891 --> 00:23:38,763
- Otherwise, how'd Will get there, right?
- Right.

365
00:23:38,764 --> 00:23:41,742
What we want to know is, do
you know where the gate is?

366
00:23:43,603 --> 00:23:45,579
Then how do you know
about the Upside Down?

367
00:23:52,361 --> 00:23:54,613
[Mike] Dustin, what
are you doing? Dustin?

368
00:23:54,614 --> 00:23:55,965
- Dustin!
- Dustin!

369
00:23:56,907 --> 00:23:58,950
- I... I need to see your compasses.
- What?

370
00:23:58,951 --> 00:24:01,345
Your compasses. All of
your compasses, right now!

371
00:24:06,751 --> 00:24:08,418
What's exciting about this?

372
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:12,005
- Well, they're all facing north, right?
- Yeah, so?

373
00:24:12,006 --> 00:24:13,989
- Well, that's not true north.
- What do you mean?

374
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:17,135
I mean exactly what I just
said. That's not true north.

375
00:24:17,136 --> 00:24:19,572
Are you both seriously this dense?

376
00:24:21,182 --> 00:24:25,769
The sun rises in the east, and
it sets in the west. Right?

377
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:28,229
Which means that's true north.

378
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,213
So what you're saying is
the compasses are broken.

379
00:24:30,214 --> 00:24:33,568
[sighs] Do you even
understand how a compass works?

380
00:24:33,569 --> 00:24:35,904
- Do you see a battery pack on this?
- No.

381
00:24:35,905 --> 00:24:37,989
No, you don't. Because
it doesn't need one.

382
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:40,867
The needle's naturally drawn to
the Earth's magnetic North Pole.

383
00:24:40,868 --> 00:24:42,369
So what's wrong with them?

384
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:44,454
Well, that's what I couldn't
figure out, but then I remembered.

385
00:24:44,455 --> 00:24:46,737
You can change the
direction of a compass with a magnet.

386
00:24:46,738 --> 00:24:49,198
If there's the presence of a
more powerful magnetic field,

387
00:24:49,199 --> 00:24:50,835
the needle deflects to that power.

388
00:24:50,836 --> 00:24:52,587
And then I
remembered what Mr. Clarke said.

389
00:24:52,588 --> 00:24:54,339
The gate would have so much power...

390
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,043
It could disrupt the
electromagnetic field.

391
00:24:56,044 --> 00:24:57,133
Exactly.

392
00:24:57,134 --> 00:24:59,594
Meaning, if we
follow the compasses' north...

393
00:24:59,595 --> 00:25:01,655
They should lead us to the gate.

394
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,853
[sighs]

395
00:25:55,776 --> 00:25:57,193
Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, whoa.

396
00:25:57,194 --> 00:26:00,547
- [exhales] What are you doing here?
- What are you doing?

397
00:26:01,157 --> 00:26:04,200
- Nothing.
- I hope that's not meant for me.

398
00:26:04,201 --> 00:26:05,660
What? No.

399
00:26:05,661 --> 00:26:07,805
Oh, no, I was just...

400
00:26:08,664 --> 00:26:11,642
- thinking about joining softball.
- Oh.

401
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:13,585
Well, uh...

402
00:26:13,586 --> 00:26:15,003
listen, I'm really sorry.

403
00:26:15,004 --> 00:26:17,857
I mean, even before you threatened
me with the baseball bat.

404
00:26:19,216 --> 00:26:20,675
Okay.

405
00:26:20,676 --> 00:26:22,260
I panicked and...

406
00:26:22,261 --> 00:26:23,428
[sighs]

407
00:26:23,429 --> 00:26:27,140
- I mean, I was a total dick.
- Yeah, you were.

408
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:28,659
[sighs]

409
00:26:30,603 --> 00:26:32,854
Did you get in trouble
with your parents?

410
00:26:32,855 --> 00:26:34,189
Totally, but...

411
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:36,441
you know, who cares? Screw 'em.

412
00:26:36,442 --> 00:26:38,377
Any news about Barbara?

413
00:26:40,112 --> 00:26:42,423
- Parents heard from her? Or...
- No.

414
00:26:45,493 --> 00:26:46,576
Hey, listen.

415
00:26:46,577 --> 00:26:49,662
Why don't we, uh, why don't we
catch a movie tonight, you know?

416
00:26:49,663 --> 00:26:52,415
Just kinda pretend
everything's normal for a few hours.

417
00:26:52,416 --> 00:26:54,309
All The Right Moves is still playing.

418
00:26:55,127 --> 00:26:57,796
You know, with your lover boy
from Risky Business? [chuckles]

419
00:26:57,797 --> 00:26:58,922
Yeah, I know.

420
00:26:58,923 --> 00:27:01,066
You know, Carol thinks I
actually kinda look like him.

421
00:27:01,067 --> 00:27:02,509
What do you think? Huh?

422
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:05,678
♪ Just take those old
records Off the shelf ♪

423
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,264
♪ I'll sit and listen
to them by myself ♪

424
00:27:08,265 --> 00:27:11,743
I just, I... I don't think I can.

425
00:27:12,645 --> 00:27:16,272
I've been really busy with
this whole funeral thing and...

426
00:27:16,273 --> 00:27:18,483
[inhales] with my brother.

427
00:27:18,484 --> 00:27:20,276
It's been really hard on him.

428
00:27:20,277 --> 00:27:23,005
Yeah, sure. Sure, yeah, yeah.

429
00:27:24,824 --> 00:27:26,467
So...

430
00:27:28,994 --> 00:27:30,220
I should go.

431
00:27:31,121 --> 00:27:32,389
Sorry.

432
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:37,102
I'll call you later. Is that okay?

433
00:27:39,588 --> 00:27:41,857
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

434
00:27:43,634 --> 00:27:46,803

[sighs]

437
00:28:00,067 --> 00:28:02,010
- [Joyce] You were here for the money!
- [Lonnie] No!

438
00:28:02,011 --> 00:28:04,612
The money! Admit it!

439
00:28:04,613 --> 00:28:08,258
You aren't here 'cause of Will. You
never cared about him. You never did!

440
00:28:08,284 --> 00:28:11,619
Jesus, Joyce, it was his funeral
today. Do we have to do this right now?

441
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:14,247
- I can't believe I fell for this.
- I'm here to help, Joyce.

442
00:28:14,248 --> 00:28:16,583
- To help?
- We could use that money for good.

443
00:28:16,584 --> 00:28:19,335
[stammering] Oh, like
maybe to pay off your debts?

444
00:28:19,336 --> 00:28:21,754
To pay for Jonathan to go to school!

445
00:28:21,755 --> 00:28:23,965
- Oh, don't do that.
- Do what?

446
00:28:23,966 --> 00:28:26,050
- Lie to me!
- I'm not lying to you!

447
00:28:26,051 --> 00:28:27,510
Yeah, well, where does he wanna go?

448
00:28:27,511 --> 00:28:28,636
- Huh?
- What?

449
00:28:28,637 --> 00:28:30,305
Where does Jonathan want
to go to college?

450
00:28:30,306 --> 00:28:32,307
We get that money, anywhere
he damn well pleases!

451
00:28:32,308 --> 00:28:34,142
NYU, Lonnie!

452
00:28:34,143 --> 00:28:37,770
He's wanted to go to NYU since
he was six years old!

453
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:40,148
So then he goes to NYU!

454
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:41,417
Get out.

455
00:28:42,443 --> 00:28:43,961
Get out!

456
00:28:44,695 --> 00:28:46,029
You need me here, Joyce.

457
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:49,741
[laughs] Oh, brother, I have
not needed you for a long time!

458
00:28:49,742 --> 00:28:52,136
Oh, no? Look what happened.

459
00:28:52,745 --> 00:28:53,953
[scoffs]

460
00:28:53,954 --> 00:28:56,372
Oh, don't you dare.

461
00:28:56,373 --> 00:28:58,917
- At least I was here!
- Oh, come on, Joyce.

462
00:28:58,918 --> 00:29:00,877
Just look around at this place.

463
00:29:00,878 --> 00:29:02,337
All your Christmas lights.

464
00:29:02,338 --> 00:29:05,506
What the hell am I supposed to think?
You're such a great mom? You're a mess!

465
00:29:05,507 --> 00:29:08,801
Maybe I am a mess. Maybe I'm
crazy. Maybe I'm out of my mind!

466
00:29:08,802 --> 00:29:13,890
But, God help me, I will keep these
lights up until the day I die

467
00:29:13,891 --> 00:29:16,702
if I think there's a chance
that Will's still out there!

468
00:29:18,145 --> 00:29:20,706
Now, get out!

469
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,875
Get out of my house!

470
00:29:32,201 --> 00:29:33,344
[sighs]

471
00:29:35,287 --> 00:29:38,015
[Nancy] You're
supposed to hit the cans, right?

472
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,211
No, actually, you see the
spaces in between the cans?

473
00:29:43,212 --> 00:29:45,171
I'm aiming for those.

474
00:29:45,172 --> 00:29:46,315
Ah.

475
00:29:48,467 --> 00:29:50,134
You ever shot a gun before?

476
00:29:50,135 --> 00:29:53,113
- [scoffs] Have you met my parents?
- [chuckles softly]

477
00:29:53,931 --> 00:29:56,075
Yeah, I haven't shot
one since I was ten.

478
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:59,560
My dad took me hunting on my birthday.

479
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:01,396
He made me kill a rabbit.

480
00:30:01,397 --> 00:30:03,273
- A rabbit?
- Yeah.

481
00:30:03,274 --> 00:30:07,086
I guess he thought it would make
me into more of a man or something.

482
00:30:08,112 --> 00:30:09,487
I cried for a week.

483
00:30:09,488 --> 00:30:10,738
Jesus.

484
00:30:10,739 --> 00:30:13,074
What? I'm a fan of Thumper.

485
00:30:13,075 --> 00:30:16,452
[chuckles] I meant your dad.

486
00:30:16,453 --> 00:30:17,763
Yeah.

487
00:30:18,872 --> 00:30:21,791
I guess he and my mother loved
each other at some point, but...

488
00:30:21,792 --> 00:30:23,459
[gun cocks]

489
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,229
I wasn't around for that part.

490
00:30:27,506 --> 00:30:28,774
Um, yeah.

491
00:30:29,717 --> 00:30:32,319
Just, uh, point and shoot.

492
00:30:34,763 --> 00:30:37,265
I don't think my
parents ever loved each other.

493
00:30:37,266 --> 00:30:39,309
They must've married for some reason.

494
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,786
My mom was young.

495
00:30:41,645 --> 00:30:43,229
My dad was older,

496
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:48,419
but he had a cushy job,
money, came from a good family.

497
00:30:49,945 --> 00:30:53,781
So they bought a nice house
at the end of the cul-de-sac...

498
00:30:53,782 --> 00:30:55,843
and started their nuclear family.

499
00:30:56,827 --> 00:30:58,745
Screw that.

500
00:30:58,746 --> 00:31:00,013
Yeah.

501
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:02,641
Screw that.

505
00:31:15,137 --> 00:31:17,156
- [woman] Hello?
- Hey.

506
00:31:18,057 --> 00:31:19,724
Jim?

507
00:31:19,725 --> 00:31:21,559
- Yeah.
- [sighs]

508
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,312
Why are you calling me
here? I told you not to call me.

509
00:31:24,313 --> 00:31:27,023
I know, I know, I
know. I just wanted to...

510
00:31:27,024 --> 00:31:29,501
I just wanted to hear
your voice and, uh...

511
00:31:31,362 --> 00:31:33,714
I just wanted to say that, um...

512
00:31:38,077 --> 00:31:40,596
even after everything
that happened, I don't...

513
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,331
I don't regret any of it.

514
00:31:43,332 --> 00:31:46,310
And those seven years, they
were... everything to me.

515
00:31:47,169 --> 00:31:48,854
Have you been drinking?

516
00:31:50,297 --> 00:31:51,648
No.

517
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:54,884
- No.

519
00:31:57,096 --> 00:32:00,264
Hey, it's okay... it's okay. [shushing]

520
00:32:00,265 --> 00:32:01,599
[crying continues]

521
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,976
You know what, actually, I
have been drinking, I'm sorry.

522
00:32:03,977 --> 00:32:05,436
Jim, I can't...

523
00:32:05,437 --> 00:32:07,605
Just take care of yourself, okay?

524
00:32:07,606 --> 00:32:09,065
Say hi to Bill for me.

525
00:32:09,066 --> 00:32:10,459
Are you sure...

526
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:24,223
[phone ringing]

527
00:32:28,293 --> 00:32:29,603
[ringing stops]

528
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:39,321
[sighs] How much further?

529
00:32:40,264 --> 00:32:43,492
I don't know. These only
tell direction, not distance.

530
00:32:44,476 --> 00:32:46,769
You really need to learn
more about compasses.

531
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:48,312
I'm just saying.

532
00:32:48,313 --> 00:32:50,815
How do we know when we get to the gate?

533
00:32:50,816 --> 00:32:54,586
Uh, I think a portal to another
dimension is gonna be pretty obvious.

534
00:32:55,487 --> 00:32:56,797
[sighs]

535
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,093
Do you think she's acting weird?

536
00:33:02,202 --> 00:33:04,763
You're asking if the
weirdo is acting weird?

537
00:33:05,998 --> 00:33:07,975
I mean, weirder than normal?

538
00:33:09,001 --> 00:33:10,686
I don't know. Who cares?

539
00:33:13,672 --> 00:33:15,691
[breathing heavily]

540
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,970
How far, Papa?

541
00:33:20,971 --> 00:33:23,323
Farther than we've ever gone before.

542
00:33:27,978 --> 00:33:29,705
- The bath?
- Yes.

543
00:33:30,647 --> 00:33:32,332
Yes, the bath.

544
00:33:35,652 --> 00:33:37,129
Is that okay?

545
00:33:41,283 --> 00:33:42,426
Okay.

546
00:35:11,498 --> 00:35:12,641
Mike.

547
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,084
Yeah?

548
00:35:15,085 --> 00:35:16,711
Turn back.

549
00:35:16,712 --> 00:35:18,337
What? Why?

550
00:35:18,338 --> 00:35:19,505
I'm tired.

551
00:35:19,506 --> 00:35:23,401
[sighs] Look, I'm sure we're almost there.
Just hold on a little longer, okay?

552
00:35:31,518 --> 00:35:32,661
[sighs]

553
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,213
[Nancy] You never
said what I was saying.

554
00:35:44,364 --> 00:35:45,656
[Jonathan] What?

555
00:35:45,657 --> 00:35:46,866
[Nancy] Yesterday.

556
00:35:46,867 --> 00:35:50,494
You said I was saying something and
that's why you took my picture.

557
00:35:50,495 --> 00:35:51,763
Oh, uh...

558
00:35:52,581 --> 00:35:53,932
I don't know.

559
00:35:56,251 --> 00:35:57,602
My guess...

560
00:35:59,504 --> 00:36:03,799
I saw this girl, you
know, trying to be someone else.

561
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,344
But for that moment...

562
00:36:06,345 --> 00:36:08,888
it was like you were
alone, or you thought you were.

563
00:36:08,889 --> 00:36:11,366
And, you know, you
could just be yourself.

564
00:36:14,186 --> 00:36:17,146
That is such bullshit.

565
00:36:17,147 --> 00:36:18,623
[stammers] What?

566
00:36:19,941 --> 00:36:22,318
I am not trying to be someone else.

567
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:24,904
Just because I'm dating
Steve and you don't like him...

568
00:36:24,905 --> 00:36:27,615
You know what? Forget it. I just
thought it was a good picture.

569
00:36:27,616 --> 00:36:29,700
He's actually a good guy.

570
00:36:29,701 --> 00:36:30,886
[stammers] Okay.

571
00:36:31,828 --> 00:36:34,264
Yesterday, with the camera...

572
00:36:35,165 --> 00:36:37,375
He's not like that at all.

573
00:36:37,376 --> 00:36:39,752
He was just being protective.

574
00:36:39,753 --> 00:36:41,688
Yeah, that's one word for it.

575
00:36:42,547 --> 00:36:44,590
Oh, and I guess what you did was okay?

576
00:36:44,591 --> 00:36:46,175
No, I... I never said that.

577
00:36:46,176 --> 00:36:47,618
He had every right to be pissed...

578
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:49,745
Okay, all right. Does that
mean I have to like him?

579
00:36:49,746 --> 00:36:51,097
No.

580
00:36:51,098 --> 00:36:53,265
Listen, don't take it
so personally, okay?

581
00:36:53,266 --> 00:36:56,244
I don't like most people.
He's in the vast majority.

582
00:36:58,105 --> 00:37:01,315
You know, I was actually
starting to think that you were okay.

583
00:37:01,316 --> 00:37:03,234
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

584
00:37:03,235 --> 00:37:06,404
Yeah, I was thinking, "Jonathan Byers,

585
00:37:06,405 --> 00:37:09,699
maybe he's not the pretentious
creep everyone says he is."

586
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,784
Well, I was just
starting to think you were okay.

587
00:37:11,785 --> 00:37:13,744
- Oh.
- I was thinking, "Nancy Wheeler,

588
00:37:13,745 --> 00:37:16,747
she's not just another suburban
girl who thinks she's rebelling

589
00:37:16,748 --> 00:37:19,750
by doing exactly what every
other suburban girl does...

590
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:22,461
until that phase passes and they
marry some boring one-time jock

591
00:37:22,462 --> 00:37:23,713
who now works sales,

592
00:37:23,714 --> 00:37:26,737
and they live out a perfectly boring
little life at the end of a cul-de-sac.

593
00:37:26,738 --> 00:37:30,052
Exactly like their parents, who
they thought were so depressing,

594
00:37:30,053 --> 00:37:32,155
but now, hey, they get it."

595
00:37:32,597 --> 00:37:33,740
[scoffs]

596
00:37:38,603 --> 00:37:39,704
[scoffs]

597
00:37:40,397 --> 00:37:41,581
[pounding on door]

598
00:37:42,566 --> 00:37:44,358
Go away, Lonnie.

599
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:45,627
[continues pounding]

600
00:37:47,237 --> 00:37:48,380
Seriously!

601
00:37:49,197 --> 00:37:51,299
I am gonna murd...

602
00:37:53,577 --> 00:37:56,180
[whispers] What? What?

603
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,313
[Hopper sighs]

604
00:38:06,923 --> 00:38:08,358
Oh, Jesus.

605
00:38:09,259 --> 00:38:10,986
[scoffs]

606
00:38:22,147 --> 00:38:23,856
Oh, no.

607
00:38:23,857 --> 00:38:26,734
"Oh, no"? What's, "Oh, no"?

608
00:38:26,735 --> 00:38:28,277
- We're headed back home.
- What?

609
00:38:28,278 --> 00:38:29,612
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

610
00:38:29,613 --> 00:38:32,031
Setting sun, right there. We
looped right back around.

611
00:38:32,032 --> 00:38:34,658
And you're just realizing this now?

612
00:38:34,659 --> 00:38:37,661
- Why is this all on me?
- Because you're the compass genius!

613
00:38:37,662 --> 00:38:39,246
What do yours say?

614
00:38:39,247 --> 00:38:40,873
[both] North.

615
00:38:40,874 --> 00:38:43,417
- [Lucas sighs]
- Makes no damn sense.

616
00:38:43,418 --> 00:38:45,461
[sighs] Maybe the gate moved.

617
00:38:45,462 --> 00:38:47,421
No, I don't think it's the gate.

618
00:38:47,422 --> 00:38:50,341
I think it's something else
screwing with the compasses.

619
00:38:50,342 --> 00:38:52,176
Maybe it's something here.

620
00:38:52,177 --> 00:38:54,678
No, it has to be like a super magnet.

621
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:56,430
It's not a magnet.

622
00:38:56,431 --> 00:38:58,432
She's been acting weirder than normal.

623
00:38:58,433 --> 00:39:01,416
If she can slam doors with her mind,
she can definitely screw up a compass.

624
00:39:01,417 --> 00:39:02,478
Why would she do that?

625
00:39:02,479 --> 00:39:04,522
Because she's trying to
sabotage our mission.

626
00:39:04,523 --> 00:39:05,957
Because she's a traitor!

627
00:39:07,984 --> 00:39:10,003
[Mike] Lucas, what are you doing?

628
00:39:11,571 --> 00:39:13,906
You did it, didn't you?

629
00:39:13,907 --> 00:39:15,783
You don't want us to reach the gate.

630
00:39:15,784 --> 00:39:17,701
You don't want us to find Will.

631
00:39:17,702 --> 00:39:19,105
[Mike] Lucas, come on, seriously,

632
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:20,489
- just leave her alone!
- Admit it.

633
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,023
- No.
- Admit it!

634
00:39:22,874 --> 00:39:26,043
- Fresh blood. I knew it.
- Lucas, come on!

635
00:39:26,044 --> 00:39:29,213
I saw her wiping her nose on the
tracks! She was using her powers!

636
00:39:29,214 --> 00:39:31,107
Bull! That's old blood. Right, El?

637
00:39:32,551 --> 00:39:34,277
Right, El?

638
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,949
[crying] It's... not...

639
00:39:40,433 --> 00:39:42,577
it's not safe.

640
00:39:49,192 --> 00:39:51,669
- [Hopper panting]
- [light bulbs clattering]

641
00:40:02,414 --> 00:40:04,123
[panting] Okay.

642
00:40:04,124 --> 00:40:05,809
Should be okay, I mean...

643
00:40:06,668 --> 00:40:08,878
I can't guarantee it,
but it should be okay.

644
00:40:08,879 --> 00:40:10,629
What the hell is going on, Hopper?

645
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,923
They bugged my place.

646
00:40:12,924 --> 00:40:14,341
- What?
- They bugged my place.

647
00:40:14,342 --> 00:40:16,903
They put a microphone in the light.

648
00:40:17,971 --> 00:40:19,513
[sighs]

649
00:40:19,514 --> 00:40:22,224
It's because I'm on to
them and they know it.

650
00:40:22,225 --> 00:40:24,018
- I don't know...
- Who?

651
00:40:24,019 --> 00:40:25,682
I thought they might
be watching you, too.

652
00:40:25,683 --> 00:40:28,814
I don't know, the CIA, the NSA,
Department of Energy... I don't know.

653
00:40:28,815 --> 00:40:31,066
You gotta explain this
to me, 'cause I am not...

654
00:40:31,067 --> 00:40:34,212
I went to the morgue last night, Joyce.

655
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:36,673
What?

656
00:40:37,198 --> 00:40:38,675
It wasn't him.

657
00:40:39,451 --> 00:40:40,576
What?

658
00:40:40,577 --> 00:40:42,804
Will's body, it was a fake.

659
00:40:45,832 --> 00:40:47,392
[Joyce exclaims]

660
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,479
You were right.

661
00:40:54,049 --> 00:40:56,151
This whole time, you were right.

662
00:41:01,556 --> 00:41:04,266
What did I tell you? She's been
playing us from the beginning!

663
00:41:04,267 --> 00:41:06,560
That's not true. She
helped us find Will!

664
00:41:06,561 --> 00:41:07,645
Find Will?

665
00:41:07,646 --> 00:41:08,979
Find Will?

666
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,441
Where is he, then? Huh? I don't see him.

667
00:41:12,442 --> 00:41:15,194
- Yeah, you know what I mean.
- No, I actually don't.

668
00:41:15,195 --> 00:41:16,528
Just think about it, Mike.

669
00:41:16,529 --> 00:41:19,281
She could've just told us
where the Upside Down was right away,

670
00:41:19,282 --> 00:41:20,449
but she didn't.

671
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:22,493
She just made us run around
like headless chickens.

672
00:41:22,494 --> 00:41:24,203
- All right, calm down!
- No!

673
00:41:24,204 --> 00:41:26,080
She used us, all of us!

674
00:41:26,081 --> 00:41:28,540
She helped just enough so
she could get what she wants.

675
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:29,833
Food and a bed.

676
00:41:29,834 --> 00:41:32,127
- She's like a stray dog.
- Screw you, Lucas!

677
00:41:32,128 --> 00:41:34,213
No! Screw you, Mike. You're blind...

678
00:41:34,214 --> 00:41:36,590
blind because you like that a
girl's not grossed out by you.

679
00:41:36,591 --> 00:41:39,152
But wake up, man! Wake the hell up!

680
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:41,261
She knows where Will is,

681
00:41:41,262 --> 00:41:44,139
and now she's just letting
him die in the Upside Down.

682
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,684
- Shut up!
- For all we know, it's her fault.

683
00:41:46,685 --> 00:41:47,810
Shut up.

684
00:41:47,811 --> 00:41:50,354
We're looking for some stupid monster...

685
00:41:50,355 --> 00:41:54,667
but did you ever stop to
think that maybe she's the monster?

686
00:41:55,694 --> 00:41:57,069
I said shut up!

687
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,320
[grunting]

688
00:41:58,321 --> 00:42:00,572
- Stop!
- [Dustin] Knock it off, you idiots.

689
00:42:00,573 --> 00:42:01,991
- Stop it!
- [Dustin] Mike, get off!

690
00:42:01,992 --> 00:42:04,034
- Stop it!
- [grunting]

691
00:42:04,035 --> 00:42:05,470
[screams]

692
00:42:09,416 --> 00:42:10,517
Jesus!

693
00:42:12,669 --> 00:42:15,379
Lucas! Lucas! Lucas, are you all right?

694
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,214
- Lucas.
- Lucas, come on!

695
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:19,383
- Lucas, wake up! Lucas.
- [Dustin] Come on, Lucas!

696
00:42:19,384 --> 00:42:21,152
Why would you do that?

697
00:42:22,137 --> 00:42:23,957
- [Dustin] Come on.
- What's wrong with you?

698
