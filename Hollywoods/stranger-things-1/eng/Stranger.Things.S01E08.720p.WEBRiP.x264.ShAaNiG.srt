00:00:08,428 --> 00:00:10,238
[insects chirping]

2
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:22,834
[Joyce yelling] Let me out of here!

3
00:00:24,319 --> 00:00:26,546
Somebody, please!

4
00:00:28,156 --> 00:00:29,490
[grunts]

5
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:31,759
Let me out!

6
00:00:32,702 --> 00:00:34,053
[door unlocking]

7
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:37,891
[Joyce breathing heavily]

8
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:53,573
[Dr. Brenner] Your son.

9
00:00:54,474 --> 00:00:56,868
We know you've been in contact with him.

10
00:00:59,062 --> 00:01:01,998
- [stammering] You have to let me...
- When...

11
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:05,710
and how did you make contact with him?

12
00:01:06,945 --> 00:01:08,505
- What?
- Hmm?

13
00:01:10,448 --> 00:01:11,799
Six.

14
00:01:12,784 --> 00:01:14,177
What?

15
00:01:15,495 --> 00:01:16,804
Six.

16
00:01:18,248 --> 00:01:21,100
Six people have been taken this week.

17
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,730
This... thing that took your son...

18
00:01:27,382 --> 00:01:29,758
[softly] we don't really understand it.

19
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,362
But its behavior is predictable.

20
00:01:33,304 --> 00:01:36,532
Like all animals...

21
00:01:38,518 --> 00:01:39,869
it eats.

22
00:01:41,312 --> 00:01:43,122
It will take more sons.

23
00:01:44,065 --> 00:01:45,208
More daughters.

24
00:01:46,484 --> 00:01:47,877
I want to save them.

25
00:01:49,404 --> 00:01:51,422
I want to save your son.

26
00:01:52,824 --> 00:01:54,092
But I can't do that.

27
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:56,243
Not without your help.

28
00:01:56,244 --> 00:01:57,554
Stop.

29
00:02:01,332 --> 00:02:03,226
I know who you are.

30
00:02:03,793 --> 00:02:05,770
I know what you've done.

31
00:02:06,963 --> 00:02:10,048
You took my boy away from me!

32
00:02:10,049 --> 00:02:13,886
You left him in that place to die!

33
00:02:13,887 --> 00:02:15,989
You faked his death!

34
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,183
We had a funeral.

35
00:02:19,184 --> 00:02:21,661
We buried him.

36
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:25,832
And now you're asking for my help?

37
00:02:29,861 --> 00:02:31,504
Go to hell.

38
00:02:32,906 --> 00:02:34,486
- [electricity crackling]
- [groaning]

39
00:02:37,035 --> 00:02:40,037
- [breathing heavily]
- Okay, now what do you know?

40
00:02:40,038 --> 00:02:41,723
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:42,707 --> 00:02:43,808
Did I stutter?

42
00:02:45,335 --> 00:02:46,919
I told you.

43
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,378
Everything.

44
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:49,814
[electricity crackling]

45
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:54,051
What do you know?

46
00:02:54,052 --> 00:02:55,636
[panting]

47
00:02:55,637 --> 00:02:58,055
I know you do
experiments on kidnapped little kids,

48
00:02:58,056 --> 00:03:00,533
whose parents' brains
you've turned to mush.

49
00:03:01,309 --> 00:03:03,185
And I know you went a
little too far this time

50
00:03:03,186 --> 00:03:05,204
and you messed up in a big way.

51
00:03:06,105 --> 00:03:09,316
I mean, you really messed
up, didn't you? Big time.

52
00:03:09,317 --> 00:03:11,336
That's why you're
trying to cover your tracks.

53
00:03:12,445 --> 00:03:15,364
You killed Benny Hammond, you
faked Will Byers' death.

54
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:17,866
You made it look like that
little girl just ran away.

55
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:19,385
See, I told you.

56
00:03:20,536 --> 00:03:23,056
- I know everything.
- All right, who are you working with?

57
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,332
Nobody.

58
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,584
But I did give all this over
to my friend at the Times.

59
00:03:27,585 --> 00:03:29,488
He's gonna blow this
thing wide open. [chuckles]

60
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:32,133
- [electricity crackling]
- [groans]

61
00:03:34,551 --> 00:03:36,069
[grunting]

62
00:03:38,179 --> 00:03:39,846
You're just a junkie.

63
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:43,642
A small town cop who
had a really bad week.

64
00:03:43,643 --> 00:03:45,995
Took one too many pills this time.

65
00:03:49,607 --> 00:03:51,858
You made a mistake coming back here.

66
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:53,544
No, I didn't.

67
00:03:55,321 --> 00:03:56,881
Here's what's gonna happen.

68
00:03:58,491 --> 00:04:00,510
You're gonna let me
and Joyce Byers go...

69
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:03,787
you're gonna give us anything we need,

70
00:04:03,788 --> 00:04:05,932
and we're gonna find her son.

71
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:10,711
And then we're gonna forget that
any of this ever happened.

72
00:04:10,712 --> 00:04:12,939
Oh, is that right?

73
00:04:14,257 --> 00:04:15,525
Yeah.

74
00:04:17,218 --> 00:04:18,695
That's right.

75
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:34,419
Nancy? Jonathan?

76
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,425
[door closes]

77
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,329
- They're gone.
- What?

78
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,745
Nancy and Jonathan. His car's gone.

79
00:04:44,746 --> 00:04:46,529
They're probably just
sucking face somewhere.

80
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,373
- [Lucas] Gross.
- No. No way!

81
00:04:48,374 --> 00:04:49,541
Did they go with the chief?

82
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:50,643
I don't know.

83
00:04:51,252 --> 00:04:52,353
No.

84
00:04:53,087 --> 00:04:55,732
What? Did you see them? Do
you know where they went?

85
00:04:56,966 --> 00:04:59,026
- Yes.
- Where? Where did they go?

86
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:03,156
Demogorgon.

87
00:06:22,718 --> 00:06:23,819
[sighs]

88
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,807
Where's the girl?

89
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:56,143
[inhales deeply]

90
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,521
[exhales]

91
00:07:00,298 --> 00:07:02,275
You gotta give me your word.

92
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,362
Nobody's ever gonna find out about this.

93
00:07:07,555 --> 00:07:11,117
And those other three kids, those
boys, you're gonna leave them alone.

94
00:07:13,436 --> 00:07:15,246
Then I'll tell you.

95
00:07:17,607 --> 00:07:20,543
Tell you where your little
science experiment is.

96
00:07:29,202 --> 00:07:30,303
[sighs]

97
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:38,311
[gasps]

98
00:07:45,551 --> 00:07:47,052
I don't understand.

99
00:07:47,053 --> 00:07:48,804
We came to an agreement.

100
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:50,472
What?

101
00:07:50,473 --> 00:07:53,376
Look, everything that's happened
here and everything that's gonna happen,

102
00:07:53,377 --> 00:07:54,601
we don't talk about.

103
00:07:54,602 --> 00:07:55,912
You want Will back?

104
00:07:56,896 --> 00:07:58,623
This place had nothing to do with it.

105
00:07:59,565 --> 00:08:02,251
That's the deal. You got it?

106
00:08:11,536 --> 00:08:13,161
What is this?

107
00:08:13,162 --> 00:08:16,081
Protection. The atmosphere is toxic.

108
00:08:16,082 --> 00:08:18,542
[stutters] But my son's in there. He...

109
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:19,769
Put it on.

110
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:36,862
[Connie] I'm telling
you, this is a mistake.

111
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,989
[Dr. Brenner] It's gone. Isn't
that what you wanted?

112
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,480
And if they find the boy?

113
00:08:40,481 --> 00:08:42,166
That's not gonna happen.

114
00:09:06,132 --> 00:09:07,817
[low growling]

[Hopper] Hey, you all right?

120
00:11:03,332 --> 00:11:04,457
[Joyce] Yeah.

121
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,239
[Hopper echoing] I
need you to relax, okay?

122
00:11:07,044 --> 00:11:09,713
I want you to slow down your
breathing, take deep breaths.

123
00:11:09,714 --> 00:11:11,899
In and out.

124
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,693
Deep breath in...

125
00:11:15,594 --> 00:11:16,779
and out.

126
00:11:17,638 --> 00:11:20,407
In and out.

127
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,728
- In and out.
- It's troll's favorite food!

128
00:11:24,729 --> 00:11:26,552
- [growling] Princess!
- No, Daddy! No, Daddy!

129
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:28,841
Roasted princess with paprika and gravy!

130
00:11:28,842 --> 00:11:30,608
No! No, Daddy. No, Daddy.

00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,448
Hey.

134
00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:38,192
- [Sarah breathing heavily]
- You all right?

135
00:11:38,193 --> 00:11:39,284
- What's going on?
- Whoa.

136
00:11:39,285 --> 00:11:41,785
- What happened? What happened?
- I don't know. I don't know.

137
00:11:42,413 --> 00:11:43,955
Hey, you all right?

138
00:11:43,956 --> 00:11:45,081
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

139
00:11:45,082 --> 00:11:47,167
- Relax, relax. Honey, honey.
- [panting]

140
00:11:47,168 --> 00:11:49,169
Honey, just breathe. Breathe,
breathe, breathe.

141
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,963
In and out. Slow, slow, slow.

142

[inhaling deeply]

143
00:11:53,632 --> 00:11:55,550

In...

- You okay?
- [breathing heavily] Yeah.

146
00:12:00,681 --> 00:12:01,907
Yeah.

Remember...

148
00:12:23,662 --> 00:12:26,498
- Straight into Will's room. And...
- Don't step on the trap.

149
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:27,999
Wait for the yo-yo to move.

150
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,560
Then...

151
00:12:31,295 --> 00:12:32,521
All right.

152
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:34,440
You ready?

153
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:37,234
Ready.

154
00:12:39,178 --> 00:12:40,446
[Jonathan] On three.

155
00:12:41,305 --> 00:12:42,489
One...

156
00:12:43,766 --> 00:12:45,159
two...

157
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,393
You don't have to do this...

158
00:12:47,394 --> 00:12:48,478
Jonathan, stop talking.

159
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:50,396
- I'm just saying, you don't have to...
- Three.

160
00:12:50,397 --> 00:12:53,441
[Mike] Guys, guys! This is crazy.

161
00:12:53,442 --> 00:12:54,818
We can't just wait around.

162
00:12:54,819 --> 00:12:57,195
Mike, in case you
forgot, we're still fugitives.

163
00:12:57,196 --> 00:12:58,759
The bad men are still looking for us.

164
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,743
Yeah, and we don't even
know where your sister is.

165
00:13:00,744 --> 00:13:01,699
El can find them.

166
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,801
Mike, look at her.

167
00:13:03,661 --> 00:13:05,644
I still think we should
stick to the chief's plan.

168
00:13:05,645 --> 00:13:09,207
Exactly. We stay here, keep El
out of sight and keep her safe.

169
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,084
That's the most
important thing, remember?

170
00:13:11,085 --> 00:13:13,086
Besides, she's
okay. She's with Jonathan.

171
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,606
Yeah, and she's kind
of a badass now, so...

172
00:13:16,465 --> 00:13:18,967
Well, where are you going? You
just said stick to the plan!

173
00:13:18,968 --> 00:13:21,427
I am. I'm just gonna go
get some chocolate pudding.

174
00:13:21,428 --> 00:13:23,596
I'm telling you, Lunch Lady
Phyllis hoards that shit.

175
00:13:23,597 --> 00:13:24,931
[Mike] Are you serious?

176
00:13:24,932 --> 00:13:26,700
El needs to be recharged!

Did you hear that?

181
00:13:51,584 --> 00:13:53,185
It's just the wind.

182
00:13:58,757 --> 00:14:00,300
Don't worry.

183
00:14:00,301 --> 00:14:03,720
My mom, she said the
lights speak when it comes.

184
00:14:03,721 --> 00:14:04,905
Speak?

185
00:14:05,472 --> 00:14:07,015
Blink.

186
00:14:07,016 --> 00:14:09,201
Think of them as alarms.

187
00:14:18,152 --> 00:14:19,754
Is that too tight?

188
00:14:20,571 --> 00:14:22,113
[stutters] No, it's fine.

189
00:14:22,114 --> 00:14:23,424
Thanks.

190
00:14:34,793 --> 00:14:35,978
Nancy?

191
00:14:37,838 --> 00:14:39,440
Yeah?

192
00:14:41,091 --> 00:14:42,472
- [banging on door]
- [both gasp]

193
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,386
[Steve] Jonathan?

194
00:14:45,387 --> 00:14:47,823
Are you there, man? It's... it's Steve!

195
00:14:48,515 --> 00:14:50,391
Listen, I just want to talk!

196
00:14:50,392 --> 00:14:51,702
[banging on door continues]

197
00:14:53,646 --> 00:14:55,122
- Steve, listen to me.
- Hey. Nancy, what...

198
00:14:55,147 --> 00:14:55,868
You need to leave.

199
00:14:55,869 --> 00:14:57,607
I'm not trying to start anything, okay?

200
00:14:57,608 --> 00:14:59,311
I don't care about
that. You need to leave.

201
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:02,278
[stammering] No, no, no.
Listen, I messed up, okay?

202
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,030
I messed... I messed up.

203
00:15:04,031 --> 00:15:05,114
Okay?

204
00:15:05,115 --> 00:15:06,950
Really. Please.

205
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:08,594
I just want to make things right.

206
00:15:09,662 --> 00:15:11,972
Okay? Please. Please...

207
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,082
[stammers]

208
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,458
Hey, what happened to your hand?

209
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:16,793
Is that blood?

210
00:15:16,794 --> 00:15:18,628
Nothing. [stutters] It was an accident.

211
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:20,588
- Yeah, what's going on?
- Nothing.

212
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:22,465
- Wait a sec. Did he do this to you?
- No.

213
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:24,860
- Nancy, let me in!
- No. No! No, Steve!

214
00:15:26,095 --> 00:15:27,887
- What is... What the...
- You need to get out of here.

215
00:15:27,888 --> 00:15:29,764
- Whoa. What is all...
- Listen to me. I'm not asking you,

216
00:15:29,765 --> 00:15:31,391
- I'm telling you, get out of here!
- What is that smell?

217
00:15:31,392 --> 00:15:33,295
- Is that... is that gasoline?
- Steve, get out!

218
00:15:33,296 --> 00:15:35,687
[stutters] Wait. What? What is going on?

219
00:15:35,688 --> 00:15:37,063
You have five
seconds to get out of here.

220
00:15:37,064 --> 00:15:38,847
Okay, is this a joke?
Stop. Put the gun down.

221
00:15:38,848 --> 00:15:40,441
- I'm doing this for you.
- Nancy.

222
00:15:40,442 --> 00:15:42,145
- Wait. Is this a... What is this?
- Nancy.

223
00:15:42,146 --> 00:15:43,778
- Three. Two.
- No, no, no! No, no!

224
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:45,589
Nancy! The lights.

225
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,449
- It's here.
- [Steve] Wait, what's here?

226
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,534
- [Nancy] Where is it?
- Where is what? Whoa!

227
00:15:49,535 --> 00:15:51,119
- Easy with that!
- Where is it?

228
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,287
I don't know. I don't see it.

229
00:15:52,288 --> 00:15:53,371
Where is what?

230
00:15:53,372 --> 00:15:56,225
Hello? Will someone please
explain to me what the hell is going...

231
00:16:00,254 --> 00:16:01,597
- [monster roars]
- [Jonathan] No!

232
00:16:01,598 --> 00:16:03,840
Go! Go! Run! Go!

233
00:16:03,841 --> 00:16:05,276
[Jonathan] Get out of here!

234
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:07,719
[growls]

235
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,322
- [Jonathan] Jump!
- [Steve] Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

236
00:16:11,932 --> 00:16:13,808
Jesus! Jesus! What the hell was that?

237
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:15,512
- What the hell was that?
- [both] Shut up!

238
00:16:15,513 --> 00:16:17,364
[monster screeching]

239
00:16:17,896 --> 00:16:19,289
[all panting]

240
00:16:23,152 --> 00:16:24,253
[Nancy] What's it doing?

241
00:16:25,195 --> 00:16:26,463
I don't know.

242
00:16:33,287 --> 00:16:34,555
[electricity jolts]

243
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,520
Do you hear anything?

244
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:43,463
No.

245
00:16:43,464 --> 00:16:44,774
[door opening]

246
00:17:41,021 --> 00:17:42,146
[Joyce echoing] Will!

247
00:17:42,147 --> 00:17:43,749
Will!

248
00:17:44,983 --> 00:17:46,627
[breathing heavily]

249
00:17:48,487 --> 00:17:50,547
Will!

250
00:17:55,536 --> 00:17:56,637
Will!

251
00:18:02,793 --> 00:18:03,936
[indistinct sobbing]

252
00:18:08,257 --> 00:18:11,509
[Hopper] "I asked Mrs. Spencer what made
them red and she said she didn't know

253
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,469
and for pity's sake not to
ask her any more questions.

254
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,453
She said I must have asked
her a thousand already.

255
00:18:15,454 --> 00:18:16,556
I suppose I had, too,

256
00:18:16,557 --> 00:18:19,642
but how are you gonna find things
out if you don't ask questions?

257
00:18:19,643 --> 00:18:21,602
And what does make roads red?

258
00:18:21,603 --> 00:18:23,438
'Well, I don't know, ' said Matthew.

259
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:26,167
It just makes me feel
glad to be alive...

260
00:18:27,234 --> 00:18:29,461
it's such an interesting world."

261
00:18:39,204 --> 00:18:40,847
[sobbing]

262
00:18:46,128 --> 00:18:47,813
[Joyce yelling] Will!

263
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:52,568
[Hopper] Will!

264
00:19:26,043 --> 00:19:27,960
[Steve muttering]

265
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:29,837
This is crazy. This is
crazy. This is crazy.

266
00:19:29,838 --> 00:19:32,190
This is crazy! This is
crazy! This is crazy!

267
00:19:35,052 --> 00:19:37,303
What are you do... What are
you doing? Are you insane?

268
00:19:37,304 --> 00:19:38,554
It's going to come back!

269
00:19:38,555 --> 00:19:40,389
So you need to leave.

270
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,367
Right now.

271
00:19:57,491 --> 00:19:59,176
[electricity pulsating]

272
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:05,474
[both breathing heavily]

273
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,208
[Nancy] Where is it?

274
00:20:07,209 --> 00:20:10,586
[Jonathan] Come on. Come
on, you son of a bitch.

275
00:20:10,587 --> 00:20:12,588
- You see it?
- No. Where...

276
00:20:12,589 --> 00:20:13,774
Come on.

277
00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:16,485
Where are you? Come on!

278
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,198
[low growling]

279
00:20:22,266 --> 00:20:23,558
- Jonathan!
- [growling]

280
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:24,934
[yelps]

281
00:20:24,935 --> 00:20:26,370
- [groaning]
- Jonathan!

282
00:20:26,937 --> 00:20:28,563
Jonathan!

283
00:20:28,564 --> 00:20:30,666
[monster growling]

284
00:20:32,484 --> 00:20:34,961
Go to hell, you son of a bitch!

285
00:20:37,781 --> 00:20:38,965
[sputters]

286
00:20:44,413 --> 00:20:46,056
[gun clicking]

287
00:20:46,873 --> 00:20:48,433
[Steve grunting]

288
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:51,937
- [Nancy] Steve!
- [monster roars]

289
00:20:52,963 --> 00:20:54,147
[Steve grunting]

290
00:21:02,931 --> 00:21:04,241
[Jonathan] He's in the trap!

291
00:21:06,727 --> 00:21:08,787
- He's stuck!
- [Nancy] Jonathan, now!

292
00:21:12,065 --> 00:21:13,709
[monster screeching]

293
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,238
Did you hear that?

294
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:21,174
[screeching continues faintly]

295
00:21:25,537 --> 00:21:28,306
Get back! [grunting]

296
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,982
- [Jonathan panting]
- [all coughing]

297
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,865
[all panting]

298
00:21:47,893 --> 00:21:49,810
- [Nancy] Where did it go? 
- [Jonathan] No.

299
00:21:49,811 --> 00:21:51,329
It has to be dead.

300
00:21:52,189 --> 00:21:53,582
[panting] It has to be.

301
00:22:02,783 --> 00:22:04,241
[Hopper] Come on.

302
00:22:04,242 --> 00:22:06,219
[Joyce] Is that my house?

303
00:22:13,543 --> 00:22:15,312
[door creaking]

304
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,075
[Jonathan gasps]

305
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,536
[Jonathan sighs]

306
00:22:38,527 --> 00:22:40,152
[Hopper] It was hurt.

307
00:22:40,153 --> 00:22:41,713
[Steve panting]

308
00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:15,563
Mom.

309
00:23:15,564 --> 00:23:17,583
[Jonathan echoing] Is that you?

310
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:21,127
Mom.

311
00:23:22,946 --> 00:23:24,297
Jonathan?

312
00:23:27,826 --> 00:23:29,886
[Hopper] Joyce, come on.

313
00:23:37,878 --> 00:23:39,437
[crackling]

314
00:23:41,214 --> 00:23:43,066
Where's it going?

315
00:23:44,426 --> 00:23:46,486
I don't think that's the monster.

316
00:23:51,683 --> 00:23:54,143
Found it! I knew she was hoarding it.

317
00:23:54,144 --> 00:23:55,561
- I knew it.
- Yeah.

318
00:23:55,562 --> 00:23:57,104
Always lying, saying she's out.

319
00:23:57,105 --> 00:23:58,772
Bald-faced liar.

320
00:23:58,773 --> 00:24:02,151
Mike, I found the chocolate pudding!

321
00:24:02,152 --> 00:24:03,628
Okay!

322
00:24:04,529 --> 00:24:05,922
Are you feeling any better?

323
00:24:07,532 --> 00:24:09,074
[sighs]

324
00:24:09,075 --> 00:24:11,327
What's "putting"?

325
00:24:11,328 --> 00:24:13,037
[chuckles] Pudding, it's...

326
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:14,898
it's this chocolate
goo you eat with a spoon.

327
00:24:15,123 --> 00:24:16,207
Don't worry,

328
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:18,671
when all this is over, you
won't have to keep eating junk food

329
00:24:18,672 --> 00:24:20,211
and leftovers like a dog anymore.

330
00:24:20,212 --> 00:24:22,463
My mom, she's a pretty awesome cook.

331
00:24:22,464 --> 00:24:24,048
She can make you whatever you like.

332
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:25,424
Eggos?

333
00:24:25,425 --> 00:24:28,778
Well, yeah, Eggos, but real food, too.

334
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,096
[sighs]

335
00:24:31,097 --> 00:24:32,598
See, I was thinking,

336
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:35,935
once all this is over and Will's
back and you're not a secret anymore,

337
00:24:35,936 --> 00:24:38,521
my parents can get you an
actual bed for the basement.

338
00:24:38,522 --> 00:24:40,314
Or you can take my room if you want,

339
00:24:40,315 --> 00:24:42,942
since I'm down there
all the time anyways.

340
00:24:42,943 --> 00:24:45,152
My point is, they'll take care of you.

341
00:24:45,153 --> 00:24:46,946
They'll be like your new parents,

342
00:24:46,947 --> 00:24:49,799
and Nancy, she'll be
like your new sister.

343
00:24:50,617 --> 00:24:52,660
Will you be like my brother?

344
00:24:52,661 --> 00:24:55,454
What? No, no. [scoffs]

345
00:24:55,455 --> 00:24:57,081
Why "no"?

346
00:24:57,082 --> 00:24:58,558
Because... [sighs]

347
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:00,668
'cause it's different.

348
00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:02,002
Why?

349
00:25:02,003 --> 00:25:05,148
[sighs] I mean, I don't
know, I guess it's not.

350
00:25:06,007 --> 00:25:07,525
It's stupid.

351
00:25:08,635 --> 00:25:09,802
Mike?

352
00:25:09,803 --> 00:25:11,053
Yeah?

353
00:25:11,054 --> 00:25:13,281
Friends don't lie.

354
00:25:14,266 --> 00:25:15,575
[sighing] Well...

355
00:25:16,643 --> 00:25:17,952
I was thinking...

356
00:25:18,812 --> 00:25:20,247
I don't know...

357
00:25:21,314 --> 00:25:24,066
maybe we can go to
the Snow Ball together.

358
00:25:24,067 --> 00:25:26,110
- "Snow Ball"?
- It's this cheesy school dance,

359
00:25:26,111 --> 00:25:28,904
where you go in the gym and
dance to music and stuff.

360
00:25:28,905 --> 00:25:31,805
I've never been, but I know you're
not supposed to go with your sister.

361
00:25:32,492 --> 00:25:34,493
- No?
- I mean...

362
00:25:34,494 --> 00:25:36,704
you can, but it'd be really weird.

363
00:25:36,705 --> 00:25:40,475
You go to school dances with
someone that, you know...

364
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:43,043
someone that you like.

365
00:25:43,044 --> 00:25:45,087
- A friend?
- Not a friend.

366
00:25:45,088 --> 00:25:47,565
[sighs] Uh... uh...

367
00:25:48,466 --> 00:25:50,235
Uh, someone like a...

[car approaching]

369
00:26:06,318 --> 00:26:08,235
Nancy. Hold on, I'll be right back.

370
00:26:08,236 --> 00:26:09,671
Stay here.

371
00:26:15,535 --> 00:26:17,720

[agent] Go!

374
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,773
You two, on me.

375
00:26:31,092 --> 00:26:34,011
This will charge your battery
right up, I'm telling you.

376
00:26:34,012 --> 00:26:36,555
- [Mike] Guys! Guys!
- What is it?

377
00:26:36,556 --> 00:26:39,224
[panting] They found us.

378
00:26:39,225 --> 00:26:40,952
[agent] We know they're here.

379
00:26:43,355 --> 00:26:45,582
Be advised, west side
of the building is clear.

380
00:26:48,485 --> 00:26:51,028
[agent] Sir, we've searched
everywhere. There's no sign of them.

381
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:53,298
[indistinct radio chatter]

382
00:26:55,492 --> 00:26:56,634
[agent] Nothin'.

383
00:26:59,204 --> 00:27:00,954
Keep it locked down.

384
00:27:00,955 --> 00:27:02,265
[agent] All right.

385
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:04,392
Kitchen.

[panting]

388
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,715
How did they find us?

389
00:27:11,716 --> 00:27:13,579
I don't know, but they
knew we were in the gym.

390
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,848
Lando.

391
00:27:16,388 --> 00:27:18,097
- [agent] Got 'em!
- [Mike] Go, go, go, go, go!

392
00:27:18,098 --> 00:27:19,348
[Lucas] Come on!

393
00:27:19,349 --> 00:27:20,557
[agents yelling indistinctly]

394
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:22,501
- There they are. Freeze.
- [Mike] Back! Go back!

395
00:27:22,502 --> 00:27:24,396
[Mike] Go, go! Go left!

396
00:27:25,897 --> 00:27:27,874

[Mike panting] El, are you okay?

400
00:27:55,719 --> 00:27:56,927
El!

401
00:27:56,928 --> 00:27:58,591
- Something's wrong.
- She's just drained.

402
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,764
No, no, no, she won't wake up. El!

403
00:28:00,765 --> 00:28:02,534
El! [echoing] El!

404
00:28:04,144 --> 00:28:05,954
[Hopper] There's more blood.

405
00:28:13,194 --> 00:28:14,587
Oh, my God.

406
00:28:17,574 --> 00:28:19,300
[Joyce] This way.

407
00:29:15,048 --> 00:29:17,091
- She's barely breathing.
- We gotta go.

408
00:29:17,092 --> 00:29:18,193
[Dr. Brenner] Leave her.

409
00:29:21,763 --> 00:29:24,056
- Step away from the child.
- [Mike] No!

410
00:29:24,057 --> 00:29:25,849
You want her, you have to kill us first.

411
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,726
- That's right!
- Eat shit!

412
00:29:27,727 --> 00:29:29,621

00:29:36,152 --> 00:29:38,487
Eleven? Eleven, can you hear me?

416
00:29:38,488 --> 00:29:39,631
Eleven?

417
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,573
Papa?

418
00:29:41,574 --> 00:29:44,118
Yes, yes, it's your papa.

419
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:46,582
- [Mike] Get off of me. [grunts]
- [Dr. Brenner] I'm here now.

420
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:49,164
Let her go! Let her go, you bastard!

[whimpering]

422
00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:53,001
Shh, shh, you're sick.

423
00:29:53,002 --> 00:29:55,170
You're sick, but I'm
going to make you better.

424
00:29:55,171 --> 00:29:59,091
I'm going to take you back
home, where I can make you well again.

425
00:29:59,092 --> 00:30:01,093
Where we can make all of this better,

426
00:30:01,094 --> 00:30:03,112
so no one else gets hurt.

427
00:30:07,433 --> 00:30:08,618
Bad.

428
00:30:10,562 --> 00:30:11,788
Bad.

429

Sorry. Hold on, we're almost

We'll be home soon, and my mom...

she'll get you your own bed.

You can eat as many Eggos as you want.

[sniffles] And we can
go to the Snow Ball.

come back to me. Just...

537
00:38:15,921 --> 00:38:18,173
- Come on, kid!
- Please, please wake up.

538
00:38:18,174 --> 00:38:19,466
Please, please.

539
00:38:19,467 --> 00:38:21,468
[Joyce echoing] Breathe, Will, come on!

540
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:23,821
- [EKG monitor flatlining]
- [nurse] Flatlining!

541
00:38:25,723 --> 00:38:26,848
[sobbing]

542
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:28,549
[Joyce echoing] Come
back to me, breathe.

543
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:30,185
I need you to wake up now.

544
00:38:30,186 --> 00:38:31,620
I need you to breathe.

545
00:38:31,646 --> 00:38:33,247
Please breathe!

546
00:38:34,857 --> 00:38:36,066
Please!

547
00:38:36,067 --> 00:38:38,068
[Will gasps and coughs]

548
00:38:38,069 --> 00:38:39,235
[Joyce] That's it.

549
00:38:39,236 --> 00:38:42,464
- Oh, my God, that's it, that's it.
- [coughing]

550
00:38:44,116 --> 00:38:46,034
That's it, baby. Breathe.

551
00:38:46,035 --> 00:38:48,244
Breathe. All right. Come on.

552
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:49,704
Come on.

553
00:38:49,705 --> 00:38:51,873
Breathe, breathe, come on, come on.

554
00:38:51,874 --> 00:38:53,667
Good, good, good, good.

555
00:38:53,668 --> 00:38:56,854
Just breathe, Will, breathe. [sobbing]

556
00:39:28,494 --> 00:39:29,804
Michael?

557
00:39:31,747 --> 00:39:33,057
Michael!

558
00:39:36,711 --> 00:39:38,062
Michael?

559
00:39:42,341 --> 00:39:44,259
[sobs] Oh, my God.

560
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,820
Oh, my God.

561
00:39:46,846 --> 00:39:47,947
You're okay.

562
00:39:49,557 --> 00:39:50,658
You're okay.

563
00:40:14,999 --> 00:40:16,726
[EKG monitor beeping]

564
00:40:28,137 --> 00:40:29,679
Hey.

565
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,574
- Hi, sweetheart.
- [Jonathan] Hey.

566
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:36,519
Where... where am I?

567
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,830
[Joyce sighs]

568
00:40:39,315 --> 00:40:41,542
[Jonathan] You're home. You're home now.

569
00:40:42,276 --> 00:40:43,401
You're safe.

570
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:45,129
Jonathan.

571
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:48,841
Yeah, it's me, buddy.

572
00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:52,720
[sighs] We missed you.

573
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:55,639
We really missed you.

574
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:58,183
Are you okay?

575
00:40:59,293 --> 00:41:00,561
What, this?

576
00:41:01,462 --> 00:41:03,772
It's just a cut. It's nothing.

577
00:41:05,633 --> 00:41:07,693
You're worried about my hand.

578
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:09,987
[both chuckle softly]

579
00:41:11,889 --> 00:41:13,365
[Jonathan] Oh, hey, uh...

580
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:15,058
We, uh...

581
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:17,369
We brought you some stuff...

582
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:20,039
so you don't get bored in here.

583
00:41:20,564 --> 00:41:21,874
So... [sniffles]

584
00:41:23,734 --> 00:41:26,921
Uh, I made you a new mix tape.

585
00:41:27,363 --> 00:41:30,424
There's some stuff on there I
think you really might like.

586
00:41:59,895 --> 00:42:01,497
[snoring]

587
00:42:17,162 --> 00:42:19,163
Guys. Guys, he's up. Will
is up. Guys, Will's up.

588
00:42:19,164 --> 00:42:20,623
[Lucas and Dustin grunt]

589
00:42:20,624 --> 00:42:21,976
[Mike] Guys, come on.

590
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:26,629
- [Mike] Byers!
- [Dustin laughs]

591
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,506
[Joyce] Be careful. Be careful with him.

592
00:42:28,507 --> 00:42:30,174
- [Dustin] Move.
- [Jonathan] Guys, guys.

593
00:42:30,175 --> 00:42:32,027
- [Mike laughs]
- [Jonathan] Go easy on him.

594
00:42:32,595 --> 00:42:34,596
You won't believe what
happened when you were gone, man.

595
00:42:34,597 --> 00:42:36,306
- It was mental.
- [Lucas] You had a funeral.

596
00:42:36,307 --> 00:42:38,224
- Jennifer Hayes was crying.
- And Troy peed himself.

597
00:42:38,225 --> 00:42:39,976
- What?
- In front of the whole school!

598
00:42:39,977 --> 00:42:41,120
- [Lucas] Yes!
- [coughing]

599
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:47,585
You okay?

600
00:42:48,527 --> 00:42:49,670
It got me.

601
00:42:50,487 --> 00:42:51,821
The Demogorgon.

602
00:42:51,822 --> 00:42:53,364
We know.

603
00:42:53,365 --> 00:42:54,449
It's okay.

604
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:55,909
It's dead.

605
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,118
We made a new friend.

606
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:00,180
She stopped it. She saved us.

607
00:43:00,915 --> 00:43:02,141
But she's gone now.

608
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:05,793
- Her name's Eleven.
- Like the number?

609
00:43:05,794 --> 00:43:07,128
Well, we call her "El" for short.

610
00:43:07,129 --> 00:43:08,296
She's basically a wizard.

611
00:43:08,297 --> 00:43:09,547
[whispers] She has superpowers.

612
00:43:09,548 --> 00:43:10,632
More like a Yoda.

613
00:43:10,633 --> 00:43:12,258
[Dustin] She flipped
a van with her mind,

614
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:13,509
and these agents were
trying to shoot us...

615
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:15,595
- Yeah, it flipped over us...
- Then she squeezed the brains out...

616
00:43:15,596 --> 00:43:17,722
[Dustin] And blood was pouring
out of their faces.

617
00:43:17,723 --> 00:43:19,140
[Mike] It was pouring out of their eyes.

618
00:43:19,141 --> 00:43:21,204
[Lucas] Agents just
started grabbing us and stuff...

619
00:43:21,205 --> 00:43:23,825
- [Dustin] ...shot out of the wall...
- [continues indistinctly]

620
00:44:48,397 --> 00:44:51,023
[Mike] Something is
coming. Something angry.

621
00:44:51,024 --> 00:44:52,358
Hungry for your blood.

622
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:54,277
It is almost here.

623
00:44:54,278 --> 00:44:56,446
- What is it?
- It's the thessalhydra, I'm telling you.

624
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,613
It's not the thessalhydra.

625
00:44:57,614 --> 00:44:59,240
I'm telling you, it's the thessalhydra.

626
00:44:59,241 --> 00:45:00,783
- [loud thud]
- The thessalhydra!

627
00:45:00,784 --> 00:45:02,452
- Damn it.
- [Mike] It roars in anger!

628
00:45:02,453 --> 00:45:04,245
- Will, your action!
- What should I do? I...

629
00:45:04,246 --> 00:45:06,056
Fireball him!

630
00:45:08,917 --> 00:45:10,227
Fireball the son of a bitch.

631
00:45:14,173 --> 00:45:15,923
- Fourteen!
- [all exclaim]

632
00:45:15,924 --> 00:45:18,843
Direct hit. Will the Wise's
fireball hits the thessalhydra.

633
00:45:18,844 --> 00:45:20,928
It makes a
painful... [imitates screeching]

634
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:23,973
and then... it crumbles to the ground.

635
00:45:23,974 --> 00:45:27,435
Its clawed hand reaches
for you one last time

636
00:45:27,436 --> 00:45:29,103
and, and, and...

637
00:45:29,104 --> 00:45:30,605
and...

638
00:45:30,606 --> 00:45:32,333
[all cheering]

639
00:45:37,321 --> 00:45:39,113
Lucas cuts off its seven heads,

640
00:45:39,114 --> 00:45:41,199
and Dustin places them
into his bag of holding.

641
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,493
You carry the heads out
of the dungeon, victorious,

642
00:45:43,494 --> 00:45:45,161
and you present them to King Tristan.

643
00:45:45,162 --> 00:45:46,865
He thanks you for your
bravery and service.

644
00:45:46,866 --> 00:45:49,665
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, that's not it, is it?

645
00:45:49,666 --> 00:45:51,042
No, there's a medal ceremony...

646
00:45:51,043 --> 00:45:53,294
Oh, a medal ceremony? What
are you talking about?

647
00:45:53,295 --> 00:45:55,338
- And...
- The campaign was way too short.

648
00:45:55,339 --> 00:45:56,964
- Yeah!
- It was ten hours!

649
00:45:56,965 --> 00:45:58,188
But it doesn't make any sense.

650
00:45:58,189 --> 00:46:00,593
- It makes sense.
- Uh, no, what about the lost knight?

651
00:46:00,594 --> 00:46:02,136
And the proud princess?

652
00:46:02,137 --> 00:46:03,659
And those weird flowers in the cave?

653
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:04,744
- I don't know, it's...
- [door opens]

654
00:46:04,745 --> 00:46:05,890
[footsteps approaching]

655
00:46:05,891 --> 00:46:07,058
Jeez, what's that smell?

656
00:46:07,059 --> 00:46:08,810
Have you guys been playing
games all day, or just farting?

657
00:46:08,811 --> 00:46:10,353
[chuckles] Oh, that's just Dustin.

658
00:46:10,354 --> 00:46:11,604
He farted.

659
00:46:11,605 --> 00:46:13,040
- Dustin farted. [blows raspberry]
- [Dustin] Okay.

660
00:46:13,065 --> 00:46:14,357
- [Lucas] Dustin farted.
- Very mature, Lucas.

661
00:46:14,358 --> 00:46:15,483
- [Lucas blowing raspberry]
- [Dustin] Oh.

662
00:46:15,484 --> 00:46:17,026
- Will.
- [Dustin] Shut up.

663
00:46:17,027 --> 00:46:18,690
- [Jonathan] Come on.
- [Lucas] Dustin farted!

664
00:46:18,691 --> 00:46:20,793
- [Will] Bye, guys.
- [Mike and Dustin] Bye, Will.

665
00:46:21,156 --> 00:46:22,865
[Mike] See you, Will.

666
00:46:22,866 --> 00:46:25,284
- [chuckles] Stop.
- No, you stop.

667
00:46:25,285 --> 00:46:27,638
- [Dustin] No, you stop.
- [both grunting]

668
00:46:28,997 --> 00:46:31,600
[Dustin] Yeah, scream! You're
like a little girl.

669
00:46:32,251 --> 00:46:33,894
[boys laughing]

670
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:44,554
- So, you have fun?
- Yeah.

671
00:46:44,555 --> 00:46:45,680
[Karen] Hey, boys.

672
00:46:45,681 --> 00:46:46,764
- Hey, Mrs. Wheeler.
- Hi.

673
00:46:46,765 --> 00:46:48,850
Hey, wish your mom a
Merry Christmas for me, okay?

674
00:46:48,851 --> 00:46:50,768
- Yeah.
- Yeah, thank you. Uh, Merry Christmas.

675
00:46:50,769 --> 00:46:52,204
Merry Christmas.

676
00:46:53,188 --> 00:46:54,856
- So, uh, you win?
- Yeah.

677
00:46:54,857 --> 00:46:57,626
- Awesome.
- Hey, Jonathan, wait up.

678
00:47:01,989 --> 00:47:03,823
- Uh...
- Merry Christmas.

679
00:47:03,824 --> 00:47:05,592
Thanks, um...

680
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:08,077
I... I didn't get you anything.

681
00:47:08,078 --> 00:47:10,079
- I... I feel bad.
- No.

682
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:14,101
No, it's, uh, it's not really a present.

683
00:47:15,002 --> 00:47:18,313
It's, um... Well, you'll see.

684
00:47:26,221 --> 00:47:27,990
Merry Christmas.

685
00:47:28,807 --> 00:47:30,909
- You ready? Let's go.
- [Will] Yeah.

686
00:47:35,314 --> 00:47:37,249
[sighs] All right. Buckle up.

687
00:47:42,487 --> 00:47:43,588
Can I open it?

688
00:47:44,656 --> 00:47:46,133
Yeah, sure.

689
00:47:48,952 --> 00:47:50,202
Whoa.

690
00:47:50,203 --> 00:47:51,304
Pretty cool.

691
00:47:52,122 --> 00:47:53,497
[chuckles]

692
00:47:53,498 --> 00:47:54,683
Yeah.

693
00:47:55,584 --> 00:47:57,978
Yeah, pretty cool. [chuckles softly]

694
00:48:00,923 --> 00:48:02,524
[snoring]

695
00:48:12,809 --> 00:48:14,202
Did you give it to him?

696
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:16,329
Yeah.

697
00:48:23,487 --> 00:48:25,338
[indistinct chatter]

698
00:48:46,426 --> 00:48:47,885
You leaving already, Chief?

699
00:48:47,886 --> 00:48:49,538
Oh, come on, you think I actually wanted

700
00:48:49,539 --> 00:48:51,263
to come to this
thing? I was just hungry.

701
00:48:51,264 --> 00:48:52,682
Oh, yeah, that's the spirit.

702
00:48:52,683 --> 00:48:55,768
Well, your wife doesn't have time to
cook for me, you know what I'm saying?

703
00:48:55,769 --> 00:48:57,120
[Powell chuckling]

704
00:48:58,355 --> 00:48:59,623
Merry Christmas, Hop.

705
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,250
- Mmm.
- [chuckles]

706
00:50:08,675 --> 00:50:10,092
[dog barking]

707
00:50:10,093 --> 00:50:12,720
- [Jonathan] What you got there?
- [Christmas music playing]

708
00:50:12,721 --> 00:50:13,846
That one of yours?

709
00:50:13,847 --> 00:50:15,949
- Yeah.
- [Jonathan] Looks pretty big.

710
00:50:18,727 --> 00:50:20,620
Be careful. You'll break it.

711
00:50:25,901 --> 00:50:27,818
What are you... What are you doing?

712
00:50:27,819 --> 00:50:29,320
[Jonathan] Documenting.

713
00:50:29,321 --> 00:50:30,780
Oh, why?

714
00:50:30,781 --> 00:50:32,239
- Because...
- [Joyce chuckles]

715
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,493
- It looks great.
- Oh, this is just so overcooked.

716
00:50:35,494 --> 00:50:38,120
- And look, the potatoes are runny.
- Mom.

717
00:50:38,121 --> 00:50:41,540
- They're so runny.
- [chuckles] Mom, it's gonna be great.

718
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:44,126
- It's definitely an Atari.
- An a-what-i?

719
00:50:44,127 --> 00:50:45,503
The green present. It's an Atari.

720
00:50:45,504 --> 00:50:48,231
I felt Dustin's today, it's
the same exact weight.

721
00:50:49,007 --> 00:50:51,175
- Really? Well...
- [Will] Yeah.

722
00:50:51,176 --> 00:50:56,555
We'll have to see, won't
we? Hey, no more snooping.

723
00:50:56,556 --> 00:50:58,808
No, I forgot to wash my
hands. I'll be right back.

724
00:50:58,809 --> 00:51:00,119
Okay.

725
00:51:00,936 --> 00:51:03,246
- [softly] He's washing his hands?
- [chuckles]

726
00:51:09,694 --> 00:51:11,338
[coughs]

727
00:51:12,823 --> 00:51:15,118
[retches]

728
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:26,252
[groans]

729
00:51:43,019 --> 00:51:45,288
- [Jonathan] Thanks.
- [both laughing]

730
00:51:48,483 --> 00:51:49,668
Are you okay?

731
00:51:50,735 --> 00:51:52,587
Yeah, I'm okay.

732
00:51:52,904 --> 00:51:54,381
[Jonathan] Mmm. Very good, Mom.

733
00:51:55,448 --> 00:51:58,576
Mmm. Hey, Mom. Did Will
tell you about, uh, the game?

734
00:51:58,577 --> 00:51:59,827
- Oh, yeah.
- No. What game?

735
00:51:59,828 --> 00:52:02,204
I threw a fireball at him
and... [imitates explosion] dead.

736
00:52:02,205 --> 00:52:04,582
Wait, what is... You mean, this is...

737
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:06,167
No, it's just Dungeons & Dragons.

738
00:52:06,168 --> 00:52:08,002
- Dungeons & Dragons. Right.
- It's fun.

739
00:52:08,003 --> 00:52:10,522
- [inaudible]
- [theme music playing]
