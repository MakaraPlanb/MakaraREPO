1
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:05,046
- ( birds chirping )
- ( bugs chittering )

2
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:11,302
Boy: Mom!

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,388
Right here.

4
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:21,938
( pots rattling )

5
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,194
Any luck?

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,823
How do we tell if they're poison?

7
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:36,327
Uh, there's only
one sure way I know of.

8
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,248
Ask Shane when he gets back?

9
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:41,916
Yeah, you've got it.

10
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:43,418
Thank you.

11
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,464
Dale, I'm heading out.

12
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:51,342
Sweetheart, I want you to stay
where Dale can see you, okay?

13
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,094
Yes, Mom.

14
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:55,346
Dale: You too.
Don't wander too far.

15
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:56,931
Stay within shouting distance.

16
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:59,767
And if you see anything, holler.
I'll come running.

17
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,811
( softly )
Yes, Mom.

18
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,065
( bugs chittering )

19
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,632
( leaves rustle )

20
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,430
( bird wings flap )

21
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,505
- ( branch snaps )
- ( gasps )

22
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,673
( wings flap )

23
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,138
( branches snapping )

24
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,569
- ( gasps )
- ( panting )

25
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:39,075
Shh shh shh
shh shh shh shh.

26
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,204
- ( chuckles )
- You scared the hell out of me.

27
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,498
I bet. That's what you get
for keeping me waiting.

28
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,999
I was trying to be quiet.

29
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,210
- Where you been?
- Amy the mushroom queen--

30
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,504
I had to wait
for her to get back.

31
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,846
- How much time we have?
- Enough.

32
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:12,400
( moans )

33
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,849
( both moaning )

34
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,568
- Come here.
- Okay.

35
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,282
( both grunting )

36
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,495
( theme music playing )

37
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:47,411
( zombies growling, moaning )

38
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:57,880
- ( radio beeping, hissing )
- ( pounding )

39
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,092
Man on radio:
Hey, are you alive in there?

40
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,635
( thuds, grunts )

41
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,597
- Hello? Hello?
- ( man sighs ) There you are.

42
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,349
You had me wondering.

43
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:09,934
Where are you? Outside?

44
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:11,560
Can you see me right now?

45
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,771
Man:
Yeah, I can see you.

46
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:16,565
You're surrounded by walkers.
That's the bad news.

47
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,484
There's good news?

48
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,320
- Man: No.
- Listen, whoever you are,

49
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,948
I don't mind telling you
I'm a little concerned in here.

50
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:27,576
Man: Oh man.
You should see it from over here.

51
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,121
You'd be having a major freak-out.

52
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,623
Got any advice for me?

53
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:36,127
Man:
Yeah, I'd say make a run for it.

54
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,131
That's it? "Make a run for it"?

55
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,841
Man: My way's not
as dumb as it sounds.

56
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,884
You've got eyes
on the outside here.

57
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,512
There's one geek still up on the tank
but the others have climbed down

58
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,806
and joined the feeding frenzy
where the horse went down.

59
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,683
- With me so far?
- So far.

60
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,477
Okay, the street on the other side
of the tank is less crowded.

61
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:56,063
If you move now while they're
distracted, you stand a chance.

62
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,232
- You got ammo?
- In that duffel bag

63
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,359
I dropped out there,
and guns. Can I get to it?

64
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,862
Man: Forget the bag, okay?
It's not an option.

65
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,364
- What do you have on you?
- Hang on.

66
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,202
( gun clicks, clatters )

67
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:26,302
Yeah. Yeah.

68
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,971
I've got a Beretta with one clip,

69
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,891
- 15 rounds.
- Make 'em count.

70
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,685
Jump off the right side of the tank,
keep going in that direction.

71
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,229
There's an alley up the street,
maybe 50 yards.

72
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,148
Be there.

73
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,317
Hey, what's your name?

74
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:44,153
Have you been listening?
You're running out of time.

75
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,571
Right.

76
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,949
( breathing heavily )

77
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,913
( growling )

78
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,749
( groans )

79
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,215
- Ah!
- ( zombies moaning )

80
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,800
( gunshots )

81
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:17,853
Whoa! Not dead!

82
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,396
Come on! Come on!

83
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,315
Back here!

84
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,985
Come on! Come on!

85
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,280
( gunshot )

86
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,284
What are you doing?! Come on!

87
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,291
( growling )

88
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,297
Come on, get up.

89
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,967
( both panting )

90
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,644
Nice moves there,
Clint Eastwood.

91
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,939
You the new sheriff come riding
in to clean up the town?

92
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:05,151
- It wasn't my intention.
- Yeah, whatever. Yeehaw.

93
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,945
You're still a dumbass.

94
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,823
Rick. Thanks.

95
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:14,160
Glenn. You're welcome.

96
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:16,829
Oh no.

97
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,331
( growling )

98
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,005
The bright side:

99
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,174
it'll be the fall that kills us.

100
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,885
I'm a glass-half-full kind of guy.

101
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,143
Rick: Are you the one
that barricaded the alley?

102
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:42,354
Somebody did--
I guess when the city got overrun.

103
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,232
Whoever did it was thinking
not many geeks would get through.

104
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,401
Back at the tank, why'd you stick
your neck out for me?

105
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,778
Call it foolish, naive hope

106
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,072
that if I'm ever
that far up Shit Creek,

107
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,616
somebody might
do the same for me.

108
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,368
Guess I'm an even bigger
dumbass than you.

109
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,347
I'm back. Got a guest
plus four geeks in the alley.

110
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,018
( zombies growling )

111
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,406
- Glenn: Let's go!
- ( men grunting )

112
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,785
Man:
Morales, let's go!

113
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,748
Woman: You son of a bitch.
We ought to kill you.

114
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,876
- Just chill out, Andrea. Back off.
- Come on, ease up.

115
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,378
Andrea: Ease up?
You're kidding me, right?

116
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,713
We're dead because
of this stupid asshole.

117
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:53,509
Andrea, I said
back the hell off.

118
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,058
Or pull the trigger.

119
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,855
We're dead-- all of us--

120
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,775
because of you.

121
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,029
I don't understand.

122
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:17,116
Look, we came into the city
to scavenge supplies.

123
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,368
You know what the key
to scavenging is? Surviving!

124
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:22,329
You know the key to surviving?
Sneaking in and out, tiptoeing.

125
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:24,456
Not shooting up the streets
like it's the O.K. Corral.

126
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,167
Every geek for miles around
heard you popping off rounds.

127
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,420
You just rang the dinner bell.

128
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,422
Morales:
Get the picture now?

129
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,674
( growling )

130
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,472
Andrea: Oh God.

131
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,980
What the hell were you
doing out there anyway?

132
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,481
Trying to flag the helicopter.

133
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,400
Man: Helicopter?
Man, that's crap.

134
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,110
- There ain't no damn helicopter.
- Woman: You were chasing

135
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,653
a hallucination,
imagining things. It happens.

136
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,155
I saw it.

137
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,117
Morales: Hey, T-Dog, try that CB.
Can you contact the others?

138
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,369
Others? The refugee center?

139
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:05,289
Yeah, the refugee center. They've got
biscuits waiting at the oven for us.

140
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:08,542
Got no signal.
Maybe the roof.

141
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,046
- ( gun firing )
- Oh no. Was that Dixon?

142
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,673
- Woman: What is that maniac doing?
- Morales: Come on, let's go.

143
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,889
( gun firing )

144
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,777
- Hey, Dixon, are you crazy?!
- ( Dixon laughing )

145
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,988
- ( gun fires )
- Andrea: Oh jeez.

146
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:41,867
Huh? Hey! You ought to be
more polite to a man with a gun!

147
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,370
Huh? Ah!

148
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,205
Only common sense.
( laughing )

149
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,707
Man, you wasting bullets
we ain't even got, man!

150
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,377
And you're bringing even more of them
down on our ass! Man, just chill.

151
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,046
Hey, bad enough I've got
this taco-bender on my ass all day.

152
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,048
Now I'm gonna
take orders from you?

153
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:59,259
I don't think so, bro.
That'll be the day.

154
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,261
"That'll be the day"?
You got something

155
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,639
- you want to tell me?
- Hey, T-Dog man, just leave it.

156
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:05,182
- No.
- All right? It ain't worth it.

157
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,352
Now, Merle, just relax, okay?

158
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,354
We've got enough trouble.

159
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,856
- Merle: You want to know the day?
- Yeah.

160
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:16,652
I'll tell you the day, Mr. "Yo."
It's the day I take orders

161
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,986
- from a nigger.
- Mother--

162
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,947
Morales:
Hey, come on, Merle. That's enough.

163
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:21,698
- Andrea: Okay, come on. Come on.
- ( all shouting )

164
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,909
Andrea: Dixon! Dixon!

165
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,411
Morales:
Whoa, cut it out, man!

166
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,705
Andrea: Stop it!
Dixon, come on! Get off him!

167
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,165
Dixon, you're gonna hurt him.

168
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,879
Morales:
Merle, cut it out!

169
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:38,549
( grunts )

170
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,140
No no no, please. Please.

171
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,768
( thunder rumbling )

172
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,896
( T-Dog grunting )

173
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,241
- ( yells )
- ( grunts )

174
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:07,202
Yeah! All right!

175
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,581
We're gonna have ourselves
a little powwow, huh?

176
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:14,209
Talk about who's in charge.

177
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:17,129
I vote me. Anybody else?

178
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,132
Huh? Democracy time, y'all.

179
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,634
Show of hands, huh?

180
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,512
All in favor? Huh?

181
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,056
Come on. Let's see 'em.

182
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,266
Andrea:
Oh, come on.

183
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,143
All in favor?

184
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,646
Yeah. That's good.

185
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,108
Yeah, that means
I'm the boss, right?

186
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:41,487
Yeah. Anybody else?

187
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,448
- Hmm? Anybody?
- Rick: Yeah.

188
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,119
( grunting )

189
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,836
- Who the hell are you, man?!
- Officer Friendly.

190
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,175
Look here, Merle.
Things are different now.

191
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,261
There are no niggers anymore.

192
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,389
No dumb-as-shit,
inbred white-trash fools either.

193
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,017
Only dark meat
and white meat.

194
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,852
There's us and the dead.

195
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,812
We survive this
by pulling together,

196
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,690
- not apart.
- Screw you, man.

197
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,569
I can see you make a habit
of missing the point.

198
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:25,072
Yeah? Well, screw you twice.

199
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,282
Ought to be polite
to a man with a gun.

200
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,159
Only common sense.

201
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,540
You wouldn't. You're a cop.

202
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,543
All I am anymore

203
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,045
is a man looking
for his wife and son.

204
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,298
Anybody gets in the way
of that is gonna lose.

205
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,719
I'll give you a moment
to think about that.

206
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,391
( pats )

207
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,232
Got some on your nose there.

208
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,526
What are you gonna do?

209
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,152
Arrest me?
( laughs )

210
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,155
Hey! Dude, what are you doing?
Man, that's my stuff!

211
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,408
Hey! ( grunts )

212
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,493
If I get loose,
you'd better pray--

213
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,371
yeah, you hear me, you pig?!

214
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,373
- You hear me?!
- Yeah, your voice carries.

215
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,625
Merle:
You hear me, you filthy pig?!

216
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,338
You're not Atlanta P.D.

217
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,926
- Where you from?
- Up the road a ways.

218
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:32,764
( chuckles ) Well, Officer Friendly
from up the road a ways,

219
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,435
- welcome to the big city.
- ( thunder rumbling )

220
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,771
( zombies moaning )

221
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,947
God, it's like
Times Square down there.

222
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:53,285
- Morales: How's that signal?
- T-Dog: Like Dixon's brain-- weak.

223
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,079
Morales:
Keep trying.

224
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:57,706
Andrea:
Why? There's nothing they can do.

225
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,333
Not a damn thing.

226
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,793
Got some people
outside the city is all.

227
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,171
There's no refugee center.
That's a pipe dream.

228
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,173
Rick: Then she's right.
We're on our own.

229
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:07,507
It's up to us to find a way out.

230
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,051
Merle:
Good luck with that.

231
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,970
These streets ain't safe in this part
of town from what I hear.

232
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:15,182
Ain't that right, sugar tits?

233
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,476
Hey, honeybunch,

234
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,269
what say you get me
out of these cuffs,

235
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:22,522
we go off somewhere
and bump some uglies?

236
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,151
- Gonna die anyway.
- I'd rather.

237
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,822
Rug muncher.
I figured as much.

238
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,908
"The streets ain't safe."

239
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,660
Now there's an understatement.

240
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,496
What about under the streets?
The sewers?

241
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,581
Morales: Oh man.

242
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,667
Hey, Glenn, check the alley.

243
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,502
You see any manhole covers?

244
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,507
- ( growling )
- ( thunder rumbling )

245
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,347
No, must be all out on the street
where the geeks are.

246
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:58,558
Maybe not. Old building like this
built in the '20s--

247
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,520
big structures often had
drainage tunnels into the sewers

248
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,939
in case of flooding
down in the subbasements.

249
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,692
- Glenn: How do you know that?
- It's my job-- was.

250
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,568
I worked in the city zoning office.

251
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,874
Morales:
This is it? Are you sure?

252
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,836
Glenn: I really scoped this place
out the other times I was here.

253
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,046
It's the only thing
in the building that goes down.

254
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,590
But I've never gone down it.

255
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,218
Who'd want to, right?

256
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,559
Oh. Great.

257
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,438
- We'll be right behind you.
- No, you won't. Not you.

258
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,648
Why not me? Think I can't?

259
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,650
I wasn't--

260
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,402
Speak your mind.

261
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:56,450
Look, until now
I always came here by myself--

262
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,077
in and out, grab a few things--
no problem.

263
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,747
The first time I bring a group--
everything goes to hell.

264
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,707
No offense.

265
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,378
If you want me to go down
this gnarly hole, fine--

266
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,673
but only if we do it my way.

267
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,593
It's tight down there. If I run into
something and have to get out quick,

268
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,928
I don't want you all jammed up
behind me getting me killed.

269
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:21,433
I'll take one person--
not you either.

270
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,810
You've got Merle's gun
and I've seen you shoot.

271
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,729
I'd feel better
if you were out in that store

272
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:27,939
watching those doors,
covering our ass.

273
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,275
You've got the only other gun,
so you should go with him.

274
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:33,403
You be my wingman.
Jacqui stays here.

275
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,447
Something happens,
yell down to us,

276
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,032
- get us back up here in a hurry.
- Okay.

277
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,285
Okay, everybody knows their jobs.

278
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,881
( water splashing )

279
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,301
( rats squeaking )

280
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,661
- ( rat squeals )
- Dah!

281
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,506
( zombies banging, growling )

282
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:49,229
Sorry for the gun in your face.

283
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,649
People do things
when they're afraid.

284
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,985
Not that it was entirely unjustified.

285
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,863
You did get us into this.

286
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,031
If I get us out,
would that make up for it?

287
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,577
No. But it'd be a start.

288
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,383
Next time though,
take the safety off.

289
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,051
It won't shoot otherwise.

290
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,306
- Oh.
- Is that your gun?

291
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,433
It was a gift. Why?

292
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,814
Little red dot means
it's ready to fire.

293
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,317
You may have occasion to use it.

294
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:40,071
Good to know.

295
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,243
- T-Dog: Anybody out there?
- ( thunder rumbling )

296
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:51,207
Hello? Anybody read?

297
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,709
I'm hoping to hear
somebody's voice,

298
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,586
'cause I'm getting sick
and tired of hearing mine.

299
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,047
Yeah, well, that makes two of us.

300
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,090
Why don't you knock
that crap off?

301
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,800
You're giving me
a headache, boy.

302
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,470
Why don't you pull
your head out of your ass?

303
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:05,305
Maybe your headache
will go away.

304
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,224
- ( Merle chuckles )
- Try some positivity for a change.

305
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:11,061
- Damn.
- I'll tell you what--

306
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,562
you get me out of these cuffs

307
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,440
and I'll be all "Sammy Sunshine"
positive for you.

308
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:21,112
Hey, see that hacksaw
over there in that toolbag?

309
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:26,451
Get it for me, hmm?
Make it worth your while.

310
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,203
What do you say, man?
Come on.

311
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:30,121
Get me out of these things.

312
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,332
So you can beat my ass again?

313
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,794
Or call me nigger some more?

314
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:38,296
Come on now. It wasn't personal.

315
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:41,299
It's just that your kind
and my kind ain't meant to mix.

316
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,510
That's all.

317
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:46,304
It don't mean we can't...
work together,

318
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:49,557
parley, as long as there's
some kind of mutual gain involved.

319
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:56,106
So... about that hacksaw--

320
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,191
I guess you want me to get
that rifle over there too

321
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,735
so you can shoot that cop
when he comes back up, huh?

322
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,825
- Huh.
- ( door clangs )

323
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,578
( rats squeaking )

324
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:19,337
Morales: Yeah, we've got
ourselves a sewer tunnel.

325
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,172
Jacqui was right.

326
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,967
Can we cut through it?

327
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:26,845
Morales: If we had
a blowtorch and half a day, sure.

328
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,806
Dale's hacksaw sure
as hell won't do it.

329
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:32,350
- ( rats squeaking )
- ( crunching )

330
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:35,770
( growling )

331
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,195
( zombies banging, growling )

332
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,072
Andrea: Mmm.

333
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,954
See something you like?

334
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:56,541
Not me, but I know
someone who would--

335
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,045
my sister.

336
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,547
She's still such a kid
in some ways.

337
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,466
Unicorns, dragons--

338
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,301
she's into all that stuff.

339
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:08,636
But mermaids-- they rule.

340
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,389
She loves mermaids.

341
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,141
Why not take it?

342
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,352
There's a cop staring at me.

343
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,021
( chuckles )

344
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,068
Would it be considered looting?

345
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:28,573
I don't think those rules
apply anymore. Do you?

346
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,207
( glass shatters )

347
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,718
- What did you find down there?
- Not a way out.

348
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,763
We need to find a way...

349
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,556
soon.

350
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,938
( thunder rumbling )

351
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:04,734
That construction site, those trucks--
they always keep keys on hand.

352
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,155
Morales: You'll never
make it past the walkers.

353
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:10,573
You got me out of that tank.

354
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:13,118
Yeah, but they were feeding.
They were distracted.

355
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,619
Rick:
Can we distract them again?

356
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,996
Merle: Right. Listen to him.
He's onto something.

357
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,499
A diversion,
like on "Hogan's Heroes."

358
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:22,585
- God. Give it a rest.
- They're drawn by sound, right?

359
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:25,797
Right, like dogs.
They hear a sound, they come.

360
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,674
- Rick: What else?
- Aside from they hear you?

361
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:30,426
They see you, smell you
and if they catch you, they eat you.

362
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:33,471
- They can tell us by smell?
- Glenn: Can't you?

363
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:36,266
They smell dead, we don't.
It's pretty distinct.

364
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,939
If bad ideas
were an Olympic event,

365
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,816
- this would take the gold.
- He's right.

366
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,026
Just stop, okay?
Take some time to think this through.

367
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,529
How much time? They already
got through one set of doors,

368
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:51,197
that glass won't hold forever.

369
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:59,247
( zombies growling )

370
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:11,426
( sighs )

371
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:49,839
Wayne Dunlap.

372
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:52,050
Georgia license.

373
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:56,221
Born in 1979.

374
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:04,145
He had $28 in his pocket
when he died...

375
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,941
and a picture of a pretty girl.

376
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:14,656
"With love, from Rachel."

377
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,033
He used to be like us--

378
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:19,285
worrying about bills

379
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:22,914
or the rent or the Super Bowl.

380
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:28,795
If I ever find my family,
I'm gonna tell them about Wayne.

381
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,180
Glenn:
One more thing--

382
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,767
he was an organ donor.

383
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,313
- ( grunts )
- Oh!

384
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:49,983
- Madre de Dios!
- ( chopping )

385
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,653
Glenn:
Oh! God...

386
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,196
damn it!

387
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:58,199
- Oh God.
- Andrea: Oh.

388
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:01,244
- ( all groan )
- Morales: Dios!

389
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:03,037
Oh God.

390
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:07,333
( all groaning )

391
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:14,299
( groans )

392
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,553
Keep chopping.

393
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:20,305
( Glenn groaning )

394
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,559
- I am so gonna hurl.
- Later.

395
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:33,484
Andrea: Oh!

396
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:40,742
Everybody got gloves?

397
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:45,163
Don't get any on your skin
or in your eyes.

398
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,502
( all groaning )

399
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:15,318
Glenn:
Oh God!

400
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:18,363
Oh jeez.
Oh, this is bad.

401
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,989
This is really bad.

402
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:21,491
Think about something else--

403
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,076
puppies and kittens.

404
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,286
Dead puppies and kittens.

405
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,623
( vomiting )

406
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:31,250
That is just evil.
What is wrong with you?

407
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,753
Next time let
the cracker beat his ass.

408
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:37,340
- T-Dog: I'm sorry, yo.
- Glenn: You suck!

409
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:44,055
- Do we smell like them?
- Oh yeah.

410
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,058
Glenn.

411
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,895
Just in case.

412
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:00,238
If we make it back, be ready.

413
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:02,198
What about Merle Dixon?

414
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,838
Rick:
Give me the axe.

415
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:21,801
- We nee-- we need more guts.
- Andrea: Oh God!

416
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:23,302
( door creaks )

417
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,598
( zombies moaning )

418
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,204
( growling )

419
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,829
( zombies groaning )

420
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,039
Merle:
Hey, what's happening, man?

421
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,333
Morales:
Hey, T-Dog, try that CB.

422
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:19,126
Merle: Hey, come on.
Talk to me, y'all.

423
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:22,213
Base camp, this is T-Dog.
Anybody hear me?

424
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,423
Can anybody out there hear me?

425
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:28,970
- There.
- ( thunder rumbling )

426
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:32,181
That asshole is out on the street
with the handcuff keys?

427
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:47,071
Boy, that hose isn't long
for this world, is it?

428
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,532
Man: No sir.

429
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,577
Dale: Where the hell are
we gonna find a replacement?

430
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,871
It's late. They should've
been back by now.

431
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,207
Worrying won't make it better.

432
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:06,215
- Shane: Attaboy.
- Carl: Yeah.

433
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:08,259
Shane:
And three, two, one-- pull it.

434
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,428
- Carl: Ah!
- ( both laugh )

435
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,806
Shane:
Start it over.

436
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:17,476
Make your "P" the other way--
around your finger.

437
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:20,938
- Oops.
- Good, just tie it around your finger.

438
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:23,608
Attaboy.

439
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,818
- ( radio squawking )
- T-Dog: Hello, base camp!

440
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:29,655
Can anybody out there hear me?

441
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:36,287
Base camp, this is T-Dog.
Anybody hear me?

442
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,164
Hello? Hello?

443
00:32:38,332 --> 00:32:39,957
Reception's bad on this end.

444
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,127
- Repeat. Repeat.
- Shane, is that you?

445
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,670
Is that them?

446
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:46,672
- ( static )
- T-Dog: We're in some deep shit.

447
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,759
We're trapped in
the department store.

448
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,469
He say they're trapped?

449
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:53,220
T-Dog: There are geeks
all over the place. Hundreds of 'em.

450
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,306
We're surrounded.

451
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:57,475
T-Dog, repeat that last. Repeat.

452
00:32:57,643 --> 00:33:00,645
( static )

453
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,984
- ( radio stops )
- He said the department store.

454
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,569
Dale:
I heard it too.

455
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,906
- Lori: Shane?
- No way.

456
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:13,658
We do not go after them.

457
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,534
We do not risk
the rest of the group.

458
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:18,245
- Y'all know that.
- So we're just gonna leave her there?

459
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,832
Look, Amy, I know that
this is not easy--

460
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,334
She volunteered to go

461
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:25,002
to help the rest of us.

462
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,672
I know, and she knew
the risks, right?

463
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,008
See, if she's trapped, she's gone.

464
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,095
So we just have to
deal with that.

465
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,597
There's nothing we can do.

466
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,726
She's my sister,
you son of a bitch.

467
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:55,825
- ( thunder rumbling )
- Lori: Amy...

468
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:00,204
Come on.
It's all right, buddy.

469
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,542
( moaning )

470
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:56,552
( whispers )
It's gonna work. I can't believe it.

471
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,930
( whispers )
Don't draw attention.

472
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,434
( growling )

473
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,814
( growling )

474
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,625
( rain pattering )

475
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,465
Oh man.

476
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,677
( thunder crashes )

477
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:51,816
It's just a cloudburst.

478
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,401
We get 'em all the time.
It'll pass real quick.

479
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,122
( growling )

480
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,685
The smell's washing off. Isn't it?

481
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,603
- Is it washing off?
- No, it's not.

482
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:36,068
- Well, maybe.
- ( roars )

483
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,530
Oh shit! Run!

484
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:42,324
( zombies roaring )

485
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:54,837
Come on, come on, come on.

486
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,193
( gunshots )

487
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,535
Rick!

488
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,301
( engine starts )

489
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:43,719
Go go go go!

490
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:45,220
( tires screech )

491
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,283
They're leaving us.

492
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:07,493
- No. No no no no no.
- Dixon: What? What? What do you mean?

493
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:09,954
- Where they going? Where they going?
- No no, come back.

494
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,127
Oh God. Oh God.
They're all over that place!

495
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,462
You need to draw them away.

496
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,422
Those roll-up doors
at the front of the store--

497
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,091
that area?
--that's what I need cleared.

498
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:25,094
Raise your friends. Tell them
to get down there and be ready.

499
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,846
And I'm drawing the geeks away how?
I-- I missed that part.

500
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,515
Noise.

501
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:31,684
( car alarm blaring )

502
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:45,990
( engine revving )

503
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,868
( tires screech )

504
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,924
Those roll-up doors
at the front of the store

505
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:05,884
facing the street--
meet us there and be ready.

506
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:15,436
( alarm continues )

507
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:23,777
- Morales: Come on! Let's go, let's go!
- Hey, you can't leave me here!

508
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:25,571
I'm not fooling, man! Morales!

509
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:28,198
- Hey, man! Don't do this, Morales!
- Andrea: Come on!

510
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,117
Hey, that's my gun!
You guys just can't leave me!

511
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:32,369
- Don't leave me here, you guys!
- Morales, come on!

512
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:34,288
I'm coming!
We've gotta go!

513
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:36,874
Dixon: Morales!
You can't leave me like this, man!

514
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,792
Hey, T-Dog. No, man.
You can't leave me, man.

515
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,461
You can't leave me here--
not like this.

516
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,254
You can't, man. It's not human.

517
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:44,798
- Come on, don't do this.
- ( groans )

518
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,842
Come on, T. Come on!

519
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,053
