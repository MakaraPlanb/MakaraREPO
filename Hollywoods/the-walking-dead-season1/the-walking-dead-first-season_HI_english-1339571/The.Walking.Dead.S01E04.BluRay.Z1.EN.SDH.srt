1
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:05,421
( birds chirping )

2
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,977
- What?
- Nothing.

3
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:24,190
It's not nothing.
It's always something.

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,069
Didn't Dad teach you
to tie nail knots?

5
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:31,072
Why would he do that?
He only ever used a fisherman's knot.

6
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:38,079
- One knot.
- No, he didn't.

7
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:40,707
No, he tied at least three.

8
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,625
Clinch knots?

9
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:44,377
No way.

10
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,629
Fine, I'm making it up.

11
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:53,511
( reel clicking )

12
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,101
Did Dad teach you
mostly dry lures?

13
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:02,353
Yeah. You?

14
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:05,273
- Wet.
- You're kidding.

15
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:07,734
But he was always so adamant.

16
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,819
I mean, you know Dad
on the fishing thing.

17
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,487
Gee, you think?

18
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:14,741
I only spent my entire childhood
with my ass in a boat.

19
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,994
But in my day it was all
about getting the hook seated.

20
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:20,037
We were fishing
for the dinner table.

21
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,623
Not us.
We always threw them back.

22
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,792
- Always.
- I guess he changed things up.

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,087
But that'd be like changing
his religion or something.

24
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:31,591
People change. It's not his fault
we were born 12 years apart.

25
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,051
No.

26
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,388
No, because the minute
you went off to college

27
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:40,767
it was my ass in that boat and
he taught me dry lures from day one.

28
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,730
This was not behavior
developed over time.

29
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:54,322
( reel clicks )

30
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,241
You think he did it for us?

31
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,911
( crying ) Because he knew
we were so different.

32
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,415
( chuckles )

33
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:08,044
He knew that you needed
to catch the fish

34
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:10,755
and I needed to throw them back.

35
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:15,510
( inhales )
All right, remember his rule:

36
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,637
no crying in the boat.

37
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,765
It scares the fish.

38
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,768
Mom and Dad--

39
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,270
I mean,

40
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:29,649
maybe Florida wasn't hit so bad.

41
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:32,735
Maybe it's better there.

42
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,904
Do you think?

43
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:40,117
( reel clicks, whirrs )

44
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,870
I think you have a bite.

45
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,665
Even with the wrong knots.

46
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,668
- ( reel clicking )
- ( sniffles )

47
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,670
Oh God.

48
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,338
( sighs )

49
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,174
So much for the no crying rule.

50
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,261
I think that was more
for Dad than the fish.

51
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,878
( shovel scraping )

52
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:50,313
( theme music playing )

53
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:33,856
( shouts )

54
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:46,994
I won't hesitate. I don't care
if every walker in the city hears it.

55
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,804
You got a do-rag or something?

56
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,110
( sighs )

57
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,490
I guess the saw blade was
too dull for the handcuffs.

58
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,995
Ain't that a bitch.

59
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:56,188
He must have used a tourniquet--
maybe his belt.

60
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,441
Be much more blood
if he didn't.

61
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,558
Merle? You in here?

62
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,995
Jim? You okay?

63
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:02,129
You keep this up,
you're gonna keel over out here.

64
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,178
Drink some water at least.

65
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,070
( growling )

66
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:28,823
( thuds )

67
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:50,136
Daryl: Had enough in him
to take out these two sumbitches

68
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,013
one handed.

69
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,685
Toughest asshole
I ever met, my brother.

70
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:59,311
( grunts )

71
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,647
Feed him a hammer,
he'd crap out nails.

72
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,774
Any man can pass out
from blood loss,

73
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,193
no matter how tough he is.

74
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,908
Morales:
Oh, baby. Will you look at that?

75
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,786
Hey, check it out.
( laughs )

76
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,248
- Ladies...
- ( clapping )

77
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,626
...because of you
my children will eat tonight.

78
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,587
- Thank you.
- Thank Dale.

79
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,672
It's his canoe and gear.

80
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,799
Carl:
Mom, look. Look at all the fish.

81
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,801
Thank you.

82
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,761
- ( chuckles )
- Whoa.

83
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,890
Yeah, whoa.
Where did you two learn to do that?

84
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,559
- Our dad.
- Can you teach me how to do that?

85
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:41,812
Sure. I'll teach you all
about nail knots and stuff.

86
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,732
- If that's okay.
- You won't catch me arguing.

87
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,694
Hey, Dale. When's the last time
you oiled those line reels?

88
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,447
- They are a disgrace.
- I, uh--

89
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,574
I don't want to alarm anyone,

90
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:56,493
but we may have
a bit of a problem.

91
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,386
- Merle!
- We're not alone here.

92
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,472
- Remember?
- Screw that.

93
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,475
He could be bleeding out.
You said so yourself.

94
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,996
Glenn:
What's that burned stuff?

95
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,582
Skin.

96
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,876
He cauterized the stump.

97
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,924
Told you he was tough.

98
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,968
Nobody can kill
Merle but Merle.

99
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,929
Don't take that on faith.
He's lost a lot of blood.

100
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,597
Yeah?

101
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,934
Didn't stop him from busting
out of this death trap.

102
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,186
He left the building?

103
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,729
Why the hell would he do that?

104
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,189
Daryl:
Why wouldn't he?

105
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:10,985
He's out there alone
as far as he knows,

106
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,736
doing what he's got to do.

107
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:15,114
Surviving.

108
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,491
T-Dog:
You call that surviving?

109
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,077
Just wandering out in the streets,
maybe passing out?

110
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,870
What are his odds out there?

111
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,999
No worse than being handcuffed
and left to rot by you sorry pricks.

112
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,752
You couldn't kill him.

113
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,506
Ain't so worried about
some dumb dead bastard.

114
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,425
What about 1,000
dumb dead bastards?

115
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,885
- Different story?
- Why don't you take a tally?

116
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,263
Do what you want.
I'm gonna go get him.

117
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,557
- Daryl, wait.
- Get your hands off me!

118
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,559
- You can't stop me.
- I don't blame you.

119
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:46,270
He's family, I get that.
I went through hell to find mine.

120
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,188
I know exactly how you feel.

121
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,817
He can't get far
with that injury.

122
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,569
We could help you check
a few blocks around

123
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:56,447
but only if we keep a level head.

124
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,659
I could do that.

125
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,998
Only if we get those guns first.

126
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,750
I'm not strolling
the streets of Atlanta

127
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,127
with just my good intentions, okay?

128
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:32,608
Hey, Jim.

129
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,528
Jim, why don't you
hold up, all right?

130
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,323
- Just give me a second here, please.
- What do you want?

131
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:42,076
We're all just
a little concerned, man. That's all.

132
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,620
Dale says you've been
out here for hours.

133
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,706
- So?
- So why are you digging?

134
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,668
Are you heading to China, Jim?

135
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,463
What does it matter?
I'm not hurting anyone.

136
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,048
Yeah, except maybe yourself.

137
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:59,468
It's 100° today.
You can't keep this up.

138
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,553
Sure I can. Watch me.

139
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,931
Jim, they're not
gonna say it so I will.

140
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:06,392
You're scaring people.

141
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,019
You're scaring my son
and Carol's daughter.

142
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:12,523
They got nothing to be scared of.

143
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,401
I mean, what the hell, people?

144
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,444
I'm out here by myself.
Why don't you all just go

145
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:20,656
and leave me the hell alone?

146
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:23,867
We think that you need
to take a break, okay?

147
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,370
Why don't you go and get
yourself in the shade?

148
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,288
Some food maybe.
I'll tell you what--

149
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,624
maybe in a little bit
I'll come out here

150
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,876
and help you myself.

151
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:34,795
Jim, just tell me what it's about.

152
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,755
Why don't you just go ahead
and give me that shovel?

153
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,216
- Or what?
- There is no or what.

154
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:42,511
I'm asking you. I'm coming to you
and I'm asking you, please.

155
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,221
I don't want to have
to take it from you.

156
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:47,099
And if I don't, then what?

157
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,810
Then you're gonna
beat my face in

158
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,062
like Ed Peletier, aren't you?

159
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,607
Y'all seen his face, huh?
What's left of it.

160
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,569
See, now that's what happens
when someone crosses you.

161
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,529
That was different, Jim.

162
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,949
You weren't there. Ed was out
of control. He was hurting his wife.

163
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,576
That is their marriage.
That is not his.

164
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:09,037
He is not judge and jury.
Who voted you king boss, huh?

165
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,873
Shane: Jim, I'm not here
to argue with you, all right?

166
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,000
- Just give me the shovel, okay?
- No no no.

167
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,836
- Just give me the-- Jim!
- ( grunts )

168
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,796
- Okay, shh shh.
- You got no right!

169
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,548
- Stop. Shh.
- You got no right!

170
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,508
Jim, just stop it.
Hey hey hey hey.

171
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,760
- Don't!
- Jim. Jim, nobody's gonna hurt you.

172
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,679
You hear me? Shh.

173
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,182
Jim, nobody is gonna
hurt you, okay?

174
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:31,185
That's a lie.
That's the biggest lie there is.

175
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:34,646
I told that to my wife
and my two boys.

176
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,442
I said it 100 times.
It didn't matter.

177
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,904
They came out of nowhere.
There were dozens of 'em.

178
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,782
Just pulled 'em
right out of my hands.

179
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,831
You know, the only reason
I got away was

180
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,667
'cause the dead were
too busy eating my family.

181
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,302
You're not doing this alone.

182
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,638
Daryl: Even I think it's a bad idea
and I don't even like you much.

183
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:11,266
It's a good idea, okay,
if you just hear me out.

184
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,852
If we go out there in a group,

185
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,854
we're slow, drawing attention.

186
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,815
If I'm alone, I can move fast.

187
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,652
Look.

188
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,696
That's the tank, five blocks
from where we are now.

189
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,573
That's the bag of guns.

190
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,992
Here's the alley I dragged
you into when we first met.

191
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,161
- That's where Daryl and I will go.
- Why me?

192
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,539
Your crossbow is quieter
than his gun.

193
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:38,877
While Daryl waits here in the alley,

194
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,712
I run up the street,
grab the bag.

195
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,339
You got us elsewhere?

196
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:43,715
Glenn:
You and T-Dog, right.

197
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,717
You'll be in this alley here.

198
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,386
Two blocks away? Why?

199
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,388
I may not be able to
come back the same way.

200
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,390
Walkers might cut me off.

201
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,892
If that happens,
I won't go back to Daryl.

202
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,936
I'll go forward instead,

203
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,355
all the way around to that
alley where you guys are.

204
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,190
Whichever direction I go,

205
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:03,235
I got you in both places
to cover me.

206
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,903
Afterwards,
we'll all meet back here.

207
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,364
Hey, kid, what'd you do
before all this?

208
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:11,243
Delivered pizzas. Why?

209
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,817
You got some balls
for a Chinaman.

210
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,528
- I'm Korean.
- Whatever.

211
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:09,092
( growls )

212
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,934
Whoa, don't shoot me!
What do you want?

213
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,437
I'm looking for my brother.
He's hurt real bad. You seen him?

214
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:21,813
- Ayúdame!
- Shut up!

215
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,982
You're gonna bring the geeks
down on us. Answer me.

216
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,283
( growling )

217
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,039
- Answer me.
- Ayúdame!

218
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,832
Ayúdame!

219
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,670
Ayúdame!

220
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,005
- Daryl: Shut up. Shut up.
- ( muffled screaming )

221
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,423
Shut up.

222
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,176
Shut up.

223
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:01,603
That's it. That's the bag, vato.
Take it! Take it!

224
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:04,147
Ah! Ah!

225
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,526
( screams )

226
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,653
( car approaches )

227
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:12,989
Get off me!
Get off me!

228
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,534
Daryl! Daryl!

229
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:16,868
Daryl!

230
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,871
( tires squealing )

231
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,957
Come back here,

232
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,917
you sumbitches!

233
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,091
( shouts )

234
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,510
Whoa whoa whoa. Stop it.

235
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:35,345
I'm gonna kick your nuts
up in your throat!

236
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:36,930
- Let me go.
- Chill out.

237
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,932
They took Glenn.
That little bastard

238
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,475
and his little bastard
homie friends.

239
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,185
I'm gonna stomp your ass!

240
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:43,979
Guys! Guys! We're cut off!

241
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,815
Get to the lab. Go.

242
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,653
Come on.
Damn, let's go.

243
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,711
Jim, take some water?

244
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,421
- All right.
- Yeah?

245
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,590
All right.

246
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,470
Here you go, bud.

247
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,226
Pour some on my head?

248
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,020
Yeah.

249
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:33,195
Cooling you down, huh?

250
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,113
Yeah.

251
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,036
How long you gonna
keep me like this?

252
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:43,121
Well, yeah.

253
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,123
Until I don't think that
you're a danger to yourself

254
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,667
or others.

255
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:57,677
Sorry if I scared your boy
and your little girl.

256
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,932
You had sunstroke.
Nobody's blaming you.

257
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,809
You're not scared now, are you?

258
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,352
No sir.

259
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,279
Your mama's right.
Sun just cooked my head is all.

260
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:19,074
Jim, do you know
why you were digging?

261
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,994
Can you say?

262
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,831
I had a reason.
Don't remember.

263
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,710
Something I dreamt last night.

264
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,217
Your dad was in it.
You were too.

265
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,678
You were worried about him.
Can't remember the rest.

266
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,223
You worried about your dad?

267
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:46,184
They're not back yet.

268
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,353
We don't need
to talk about that.

269
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,063
Your dad's a police officer, son.

270
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:51,857
He helps people.

271
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,734
Probably just came across
some folks needing help, that's all.

272
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,487
That man,
he is tough as nails.

273
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:00,615
I don't know him well but...

274
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,451
I could see it in him.

275
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,870
Am I right?

276
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,205
Oh yeah.

277
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,669
There ain't nothing gonna
stop him from getting back here

278
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,921
to you and your mom,
I promise you that.

279
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,178
All right.

280
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,556
Who wants to help me
clean some fish, huh?

281
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,516
Carl:
Sweet. Come on, Sophia.

282
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:29,227
Lori:
Stay with Carol, all right?

283
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,707
You keep your boy close.

284
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,919
You don't ever let him
out of your sight.

285
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,097
Those men you were with,
we need to know where they went.

286
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,141
I ain't telling you nothing.

287
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:11,269
Jesus, man.
What the hell happened back there?

288
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,688
I told you, this little turd
and his douche bag friends

289
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:15,440
came out of nowhere
and jumped me.

290
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,484
You're the one
who jumped me, puto,

291
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:20,320
screaming about trying to find
his brother like it's my damn fault.

292
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:22,614
They took Glenn.
Could have taken Merle too.

293
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,075
Merle? What kind of
hick name is that?

294
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,118
I wouldn't name my dog Merle.

295
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,663
Damn it, Daryl. Back off.

296
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,464
Want to see what happened
to the last guy that pissed me off?

297
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,554
( screams )

298
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,642
Start with the feet this time.

299
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,022
The men you were with
took our friend.

300
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,482
All we want to do
is talk to them,

301
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,109
see if we can work
something out.

302
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,701
( rattles )

303
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,327
You sure you're up for this?

304
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,788
- Yeah.
- Okay.

305
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:16,668
One wrong move,

306
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,712
you get an arrow in the ass.
Just so you know.

307
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,880
G's gonna take that
arrow out of my ass

308
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,508
and shove it up yours.
Just so you know.

309
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:26,177
- G?
- Guillermo.

310
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,804
He's the man here.

311
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,180
Okay then.

312
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,683
- ( cocks gun )
- Let's go see Guillermo.

313
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,600
- ( lock clacks )
- ( doors creaking )

314
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,070
You okay, little man?

315
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:28,239
They're gonna cut off
my feet, carnal.

316
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,908
Cops do that?

317
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,911
Not him. This redneck puto here.

318
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:35,038
He cut off some dude's hand, man.
He showed it to me.

319
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:37,916
- Shut up.
- Hey, that's that vato right there.

320
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:40,210
He shot me in the ass with an arrow.
What's up, homes, huh?

321
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,545
Chill, ese, chill. Chill.

322
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:45,882
This true?

323
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,301
He wants Miguelito's feet?

324
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:49,803
That's pretty sick, man.

325
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,764
We were hoping more
for a calm discussion.

326
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,599
That hillbilly jumps
Felipe's little cousin,

327
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,101
beats on him,
threatens to cut off his feet,

328
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,685
Felipe gets an arrow in the ass

329
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,271
and you want a calm discussion?

330
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,816
You fascinate me.

331
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,526
Heat of the moment.

332
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,612
Mistakes were made on both sides.

333
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,825
Who's that dude to you anyway?
You don't look related.

334
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,744
He's one of our group, more or less.

335
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:16,955
I'm sure you have a few like him.

336
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:19,249
Daryl:
You got my brother in there?

337
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,793
Guillermo:
Sorry, we're fresh out of white boys.

338
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:24,129
But I've got Asian.
You interested?

339
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,840
I have one of yours,
you have one of mine.

340
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,008
Sounds like an even trade.

341
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:32,220
- Don't sound even to me.
- G.

342
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:34,472
- Come on, man.
- Guillermo: My people got attacked.

343
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,641
Where's the compensation
for their pain and suffering?

344
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,977
More to the point,
where's my bag of guns?

345
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:41,771
- Guns?
- The bag Miguel saw in the street.

346
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:43,648
The bag Felipe and Jorge
were going back to get.

347
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,650
- That bag of guns.
- You're mistaken.

348
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,986
- I don't think so.
- Rick: About it being yours.

349
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,488
It's my bag of guns.

350
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,448
The bag was in the street.

351
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,659
Anybody could come around
and say it was theirs.

352
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:57,829
I'm supposed to take your word?

353
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,706
What's to stop my people
from unloading on you

354
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:01,708
right here and now
and I take what's mine?

355
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:06,212
You could do that.

356
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,507
Or not.

357
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:15,096
Come on, man. Make the trade.

358
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,140
Please.

359
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,518
Oye.

360
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,693
( whimpers )

361
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:36,201
Guillermo:
I see two options.

362
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,745
You come back with Miguel
and my bag of guns,

363
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:40,496
everybody walks.

364
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,707
Or you come back
locked and loaded,

365
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,084
we'll see which side
spills more blood.

366
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:59,599
( clacking )

367
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,191
Them guns are worth
more than gold.

368
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:12,153
Gold won't protect your family
or put food on the table.

369
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:13,905
You willing to give that up
for that kid?

370
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,492
T-Dog: If I knew we'd get
Glenn back, I might agree.

371
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,119
But you think that vato across the way
is just gonna hand him over?

372
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,330
- You calling G a liar?
- Are you a part of this?

373
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:24,582
You want to hold onto your teeth?

374
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:29,254
Question is,
do you trust that man's word?

375
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,547
Daryl: No, question is
what are you willing to bet on it?

376
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,300
Could be more than them guns.
Could be your life.

377
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:36,511
Glenn worth that to you?

378
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:41,307
What life I have I owe to him.

379
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:43,059
I was nobody to Glenn,

380
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:45,937
just some idiot stuck in a tank.

381
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:48,189
He could have walked away,
but he didn't.

382
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:49,732
Neither will I.

383
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,401
So you're gonna hand
the guns over?

384
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,028
I didn't say that.

385
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,324
There's nothing keeping you two here.

386
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:00,451
You should get out,
head back to camp.

387
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,161
And tell your family what?

388
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:17,135
Come on, this is nuts.

389
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:23,308
Just do like G says.

390
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,823
( door clacking )

391
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:57,800
I see my guns
but they're not all in the bag.

392
00:27:57,968 --> 00:27:59,677
That's because they're not yours.

393
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,471
I thought I mentioned that.

394
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,473
Let's just shoot
these fools right now, ese.

395
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,141
All right?
Unload on their asses, ese.

396
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:08,936
I don't think you fully appreciate
the gravity of the situation.

397
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,022
No, I'm pretty clear.

398
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:17,528
You have your man.
I want mine.

399
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:23,493
I'm gonna chop up your boy.
I'm gonna feed him to my dogs.

400
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,579
They're the evilest, nastiest
man-eating bitches you ever saw.

401
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:28,706
I picked them up
from Satan at a yard sale.

402
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,043
I told you how it has to be.
Are you woefully deaf?

403
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:35,088
No, my hearing's fine.
You said come locked and loaded.

404
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:39,717
Okay then, we're here.

405
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,893
Woman:
Felipe! Felipe!

406
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:54,315
Abuela, go back
with the others-- now.

407
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:55,650
Get that old lady out
of the line of fire!

408
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:58,152
Abuela, listen to your m'hijo, okay?

409
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,821
This is the not the place
for you right now.

410
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:03,074
Mr. Gilbert is having
trouble breathing.

411
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,827
He needs his asthma stuff.

412
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,453
Carlito didn't find it.

413
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:09,914
He needs his medicine.

414
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:14,585
Felipe, go take care of it, okay?

415
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,129
And take your
grandmother with you.

416
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,131
( Felipe speaks Spanish )

417
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,842
Who are those men?

418
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,594
- ( Felipe speaks Spanish )
- Don't you take him.

419
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,847
- Ma'am?
- Felipe's a good boy.

420
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:29,100
He have his trouble
but he pull himself together.

421
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:32,061
We need him here.

422
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,439
Ma'am,

423
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,858
I'm not here to arrest
your grandson.

424
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,860
Then what do you want him for?

425
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,863
He's...

426
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,031
helping us find a missing person.

427
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,575
Fella named Glenn.

428
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:48,161
The Asian boy?

429
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,621
He's with Mr. Gilbert.

430
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,958
Come. Come, I show you.

431
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,335
He needs his medicine.

432
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,130
Let 'em pass.

433
00:30:22,196 --> 00:30:24,197
- ( man coughing )
- ( people whispering )

434
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:31,120
Abuela, por favor.
Take me to him.

435
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,343
( people coughing )

436
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:04,862
All right. All right.

437
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,532
Nice and easy. Just breathe.

438
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,742
Just breathe. Just let it out.
Just breathe.

439
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,911
( inhaler hisses )

440
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:14,580
Woman:
Just relax.

441
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:18,417
- What the hell is this?
- An asthma attack.

442
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,545
Couldn't get his breath
all of a sudden.

443
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,256
I thought you were being
eaten by dogs, man.

444
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,677
( barks )

445
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,721
Could I have a word with you?

446
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,432
You're the dumbest
son of a bitch I ever met.

447
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,394
We walked in there ready
to kill every last one of you.

448
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,354
Well, I'm glad
it didn't go down that way.

449
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:42,733
If it had, that blood
would be on my hands.

450
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,944
Mine too.
We'd have fought back.

451
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:46,821
Wouldn't be
the first time we've had to.

452
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:50,575
Protect the food, the medicine--
what's left of it.

453
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,618
These people, the old ones--

454
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:55,288
the staff took off,
just left 'em here to die.

455
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:03,254
Me and Felipe were
the only ones who stayed.

456
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:06,632
What are you, doctors?

457
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,303
Felipe's a nurse--
a special care provider.

458
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,930
Me,

459
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,766
I'm the custodian.

460
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:29,447
What about the rest of your crew?

461
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:31,616
The vatos trickle in

462
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,951
to check on their parents,
their grandparents.

463
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:37,079
They see how things are
and most decide to stay.

464
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:40,124
It's a good thing too.
We need the muscle.

465
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:43,586
The people we've encountered
since things fell apart,

466
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:46,422
the worst kind-- plunderers,

467
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,466
the kind that take by force.

468
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:51,344
- That's not who we are.
- Guillermo: How was I to know?

469
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:54,597
My people got attacked and you
show up with Miguel hostage--

470
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:57,141
appearances.

471
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,769
Guess the world changed.

472
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,979
Guillermo: No.

473
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:05,316
It's the same as it ever was.
The weak get taken.

474
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,528
So we do what we can here.

475
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,697
The vatos work on those cars,

476
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:13,658
talk about getting
the old people out of the city.

477
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,951
But most can't even get to
the bathroom by themselves,

478
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,953
so that's just a dream.

479
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,122
Still, it keeps the crew busy,

480
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,166
and that's worth something.

481
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:25,294
So we barred all the windows,

482
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:27,630
welded all the doors shut
except for one entrance.

483
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:29,173
The vatos, they go out,

484
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,676
scavenge what they can
to keep us going.

485
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:35,513
We watch the perimeter
night and day and we wait.

486
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:40,059
The people here,

487
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:43,604
they all look to me now.

488
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:46,315
I don't even know why.

489
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,027
Because they can.

490
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:13,592
Glenn: Admit it, you only came back
to Atlanta for the hat.

491
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,302
Rick:
Don't tell anybody.

492
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,304
Daryl: You've given away
half our guns and ammo.

493
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,515
- Rick: Not nearly half.
- Daryl: For what?

494
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:21,684
Bunch of old farts who are
gonna die off momentarily anyhow?

495
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:23,894
Seriously,
how long you think they got?

496
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,897
How long do any of us?

497
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,528
- Glenn: Oh my God.
- Where the hell's our van?

498
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:33,738
We left it right there.
Who would take it?

499
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,072
Merle.

500
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:40,244
He's gonna be taking
some vengeance back to camp.

501
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,758
Wrapping paper,
color tissue, anything?

502
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,259
Dale:
Seriously?

503
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,969
How can you not have any?

504
00:34:57,137 --> 00:35:00,598
Had I been informed of the impending
apocalypse I'd have stocked up.

505
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:03,267
It's Amy's birthday tomorrow.

506
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:06,562
I've been marking days
on the calendar just to make sure.

507
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,442
You don't give a gift unwrapped.

508
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,404
Deep breath.

509
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:18,157
I'm sure I'll find something here.

510
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:28,584
I, uh, built up
the rocks all around.

511
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:30,753
See? So the flames can
be a little higher

512
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:32,296
and have 'em be hidden.

513
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:37,468
Hey, Jim.
How you feeling, man?

514
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:40,679
I'm better.
More myself now.

515
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,890
I hope you understand
the need for this--

516
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,100
this timeout.

517
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,770
I've got others
I've got to think about.

518
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:50,564
I just want to
make sure there's no--

519
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:52,483
there's no hard feelings.

520
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,152
There's not. I do understand.

521
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,613
Okay.
( chuckles )

522
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:00,157
Why don't you come
join in with the rest of us?

523
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:02,326
Big ol' fish fry.

524
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,164
- I'd like that very much.
- Shane: Okay.

525
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:10,501
( plastic rustles )

526
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,336
Why don't you come outside
with everybody?

527
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,964
Hell with them people.

528
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,258
Wouldn't piss on them
if their heads was on fire.

529
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:20,219
Hey!

530
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:22,596
Why don't you stay here?

531
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,014
Keep your daddy company.

532
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:29,186
Ed, she wants to join in.

533
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,939
- Come on.
- Ed: Fine.

534
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,774
Hell with the both of you.

535
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:36,277
Ain't no need to be bothering me
no more the rest of the night.

536
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,740
( all panting )

537
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,039
- ( people laugh )
- Sophia: Pass the fish, please.

538
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,543
- Carol: Here you go.
- Shane: Man o man, that's good.

539
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,962
Whew.
( chuckles )

540
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,131
I miss this.

541
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,185
I've got to ask you, man.
It's been driving me crazy.

542
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,396
- Dale: What?
- That watch.

543
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,025
What's wrong with my watch?

544
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:19,153
I see you every day,
the same time,

545
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:21,697
winding that thing

546
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:23,574
like a village priest saying mass.

547
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,826
I've wondered this myself.

548
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:28,787
- I'm missing the point.
- Jacqui: Unless I've misread the signs,

549
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:32,082
the world seems to
have come to an end.

550
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,752
At least hit a speed bump
for a good long while.

551
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,047
But there's you every day
winding that stupid watch.

552
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:41,926
Time-- it's important
to keep track, isn't it?

553
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,345
The days at least.

554
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,930
Don't you think, Andrea?

555
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,140
- Back me up here.
- ( chuckles )

556
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:55,314
I like-- I like what, um,

557
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:59,234
a father said to son
when he gave him a watch

558
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:03,155
that had been handed down
through generations.

559
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:05,616
He said,

560
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:09,787
"I give you the mausoleum

561
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:12,539
of all hope and desire,

562
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:16,085
which will fit
your individual needs

563
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:19,964
no better than it did mine
or my father's before me;

564
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,132
I give it to you

565
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,387
not that you may remember time,

566
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:30,349
but that you may forget it
for a moment

567
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:33,018
now and then

568
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:37,439
and not spend all of your breath
trying to conquer it."

569
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,450
You are so weird.

570
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:49,785
( all laugh )

571
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:51,996
It's not me. It's Faulkner.

572
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,666
William Faulkner.
Maybe my bad paraphrasing.

573
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,842
- Where are you going?
- I have to pee.

574
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,845
Jeez, you try to be
discreet around here--

575
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:11,306
( laughs )

576
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:14,018
( rustling )

577
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:17,021
Thought I told y'all to leave
me the hell alone, didn't I?

578
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,734
Hey!

579
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:26,363
- What'd I say?
- ( growling )

580
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:27,865
Oh!

581
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:31,201
We're out of toilet paper?

582
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,203
( growling )

583
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,251
( gasps, screaming )

584
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:46,717
( people screaming )

585
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:49,762
- Carl: Mom!
- Lori: Carl!

586
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:53,891
Lori, get him down!

587
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,814
- ( guns firing )
- Oh my God.

588
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,441
T-Dog: Go! Go!

589
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:04,943
( woman, children screaming )

590
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,624
Lori: I'm right here.
Shane, what do we do?

591
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:21,126
- Shane?
- Follow me!

592
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:23,462
( screaming )

593
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:28,592
No! No!

594
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:33,931
Oh! Oh!

595
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:35,933
Oh God!
Oh my God!

596
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:38,936
( groans )
Help me.

597
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:41,230
Oh God, I don't know what to do.

598
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:42,648
I don't know what to do.

599
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:45,734
( crying )

600
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:47,778
- Come on. Come on, stay close.
- Carol!

601
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,404
Shane:
Stay close!

602
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:52,116
( screaming )

603
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,416
Come on, y'all!
Work your way up here!

604
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,669
Lori:
Right in front of you. Shane!

605
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:07,297
Morales:
Get to the RV! Go!

606
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,134
- Lori: Shane! Shane!
- Shane: Stay with me.

607
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:15,514
Stay behind me.
Morales, work up here!

608
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:18,517
- Lori: Get behind me! Come on!
- Shane: Let's go!

609
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:20,269
- ( girl screaming )
- Lori: Stay with me.

610
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,771
Shane: Come on, make your way
to the Winnebago!

611
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:25,816
- ( gunshots )
- ( shouting )

612
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,546
Baby! Carl!

613
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:48,797
Baby!

614
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:50,674
- Dad!
- Carl!

615
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:54,428
( crying )

616
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:09,193
( panting )

617
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:13,530
( sobbing )

618
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:14,990
Shh shh shh.

619
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,496
Oh, Amy.

620
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,042
( gags )

621
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:33,175
I don't know what to do, Amy.

622
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:16,593
Oh. Oh.

623
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,263
Oh.

624
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:21,723
Oh.

625
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:26,895
Oh. Oh.

626
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:31,441
Oh, Amy.

627
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,778
( crying )

628
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,959
Oh no no.

629
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:53,463
Amy!

630
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,466
( wailing ) Amy!

631
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,969
Amy!

632
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:01,305
I remember my dream now,

633
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,099
why I dug the holes.

634
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:21,033
( music playing )
