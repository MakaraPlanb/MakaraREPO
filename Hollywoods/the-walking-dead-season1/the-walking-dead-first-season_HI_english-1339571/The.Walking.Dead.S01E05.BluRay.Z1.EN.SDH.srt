1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,921
- ( walkie-talkie squawks )
- Rick: Morgan,

2
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:08,007
I don't know if you're out there.

3
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:10,134
I don't know
if you can hear me.

4
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:12,512
Maybe you're listening right now.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,055
I hope so.

6
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:16,891
I found others-- my family,

7
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,518
if you can believe it.

8
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:20,520
( static )

9
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:22,689
My wife and son,

10
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,524
they're alive.

11
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:27,026
I wanted you to know that.

12
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:31,614
There's something else
you need to know.

13
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:33,533
Atlanta isn't what we thought.

14
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:36,077
It's not what they promised.
The city is--

15
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:40,707
do not enter the city.

16
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,376
It belongs to the dead now.

17
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:49,841
We're camped
a few miles northwest,

18
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,051
up by a big abandoned
rock quarry.

19
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,762
You can see it on a map.

20
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,474
I hope you come find us.

21
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,727
But be careful.

22
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,647
Last night walkers
came out of the woods.

23
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:09,068
We lost people.

24
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:14,407
Watch yourself, Morgan.
Take care of your boy.

25
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:16,409
I'll try you again
tomorrow at dawn.

26
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:19,787
( static )

27
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,387
Andrea.

28
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,353
I'm so sorry.

29
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:48,691
She's gone.

30
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,819
You got to let us take her.

31
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,119
We all cared about her

32
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:03,456
and I promise
we'll be as gentle as we can.

33
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,934
( grunts )

34
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:35,071
( coughing )

35
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,538
She still won't move?

36
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,082
Lori:
Won't even talk to us.

37
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,627
She's been there all night.

38
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,754
What do we do?

39
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,841
Can't just leave Amy like that.

40
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,009
We need to deal with it

41
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,095
same as the others.

42
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:02,515
I'll tell her how it is.

43
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:08,604
- Andrea.
- ( cocks )

44
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,774
I know how the safety works.

45
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,738
All right. Okay.

46
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,032
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,829
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

48
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,720
( theme music playing )

49
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,296
Daryl:
Y'all can't be serious.

50
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,340
Let that girl hamstring us?

51
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,966
The dead girl's a time bomb.

52
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,302
Rick:
What do you suggest?

53
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,430
Take the shot.

54
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,933
Clean, in the brain from here.

55
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,602
Hell, I can hit a turkey between
the eyes from this distance.

56
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,772
No. For God's sakes, let her be.

57
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,615
( scoffs )

58
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:49,163
Wake up, Jimbo.
We've got some work to do.

59
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,833
( panting )

60
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,294
Morales: Thanks.

61
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,296
- Thanks.
- What are you guys doing?

62
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:00,132
This is for geeks.
Our people go over there.

63
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,093
Daryl: What's the difference?
They're all infected.

64
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,638
Glenn: Our people go
in that row over there.

65
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,307
We don't burn them!

66
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,643
We bury them.

67
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,271
Understand?

68
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,653
Our people go
in that row over there.

69
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,994
You reap what you sow.

70
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,162
Morales:
You know what? Shut up, man.

71
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,331
Y'all left my brother for dead.

72
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,002
You had this coming.

73
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:47,471
Are you bleeding?

74
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,850
I just got some on me
from the bodies.

75
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,185
That blood is fresh.
Were you bit?

76
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,520
Jim: No.

77
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,564
I got scratched during the attack.

78
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:58,232
- You got bit.
- I'm fine.

79
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,026
Then show me.

80
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,615
- ( whispers ) Don't tell, please.
- A walker got him.

81
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,868
A walker bit Jim.

82
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,707
- Jim: I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Show it to us.

83
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,626
- Show it to us.
- ( chattering )

84
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,211
- Shane: Easy, Jim.
- Daryl: Grab him.

85
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,589
Jim, put it down. Put it down.

86
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:24,008
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

87
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:26,886
I'm okay. I'm okay.

88
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,013
I'm okay.

89
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,850
I'm okay. I'm okay.

90
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,977
I'm okay.

91
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,396
I'm okay.
( breathing heavily )

92
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,943
I'm okay.

93
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,410
I say we put
a pickaxe in his head

94
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:52,870
and the dead girl's
and be done with it.

95
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,914
Is that what you'd want
if it were you?

96
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,208
Yeah, and I'd thank you
while you did it.

97
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,251
I hate to say it--
I never thought I would--

98
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,878
but maybe Daryl's right.

99
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:03,881
Jim's not a monster, Dale,
or some rabid dog.

100
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,217
- I'm not suggesting--
- He's sick. A sick man.

101
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,219
We start down that road,
where do we draw the line?

102
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,764
The line's pretty clear.
Zero tolerance for walkers,

103
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,308
- or them to be.
- What if we can get him help?

104
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:16,477
I heard the CDC
was working on a cure.

105
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,605
I heard that too. Heard a lot of things
before the world went to hell.

106
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,732
What if the CDC is
still up and running?

107
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,818
- Man, that is a stretch right there.
- Rick: Why?

108
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:27,780
If there's any government left,
any structure at all,

109
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,949
they'd protect the CDC
at all costs, wouldn't they?

110
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,660
I think it's our best shot.
Shelter, protection--

111
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:35,746
Okay, Rick, you want those things,
all right? I do too, okay?

112
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:40,000
Now if they exist, they're at
the army base. Fort Benning.

113
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,293
That's 100 miles
in the opposite direction.

114
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,379
That is right.
But it's away from the hot zone.

115
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:45,297
Now listen to me.
If that place is operational,

116
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,509
it'll be heavily armed.
We'd be safe there.

117
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,803
Rick: The military were
on the front lines of this thing.

118
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,055
They got overrun.
We've all seen that.

119
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:56,308
The CDC is our best choice
and Jim's only chance.

120
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:01,689
You go looking for aspirin,
do what you need to do.

121
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:03,607
Someone needs to have
some balls to take care

122
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,234
- of this damn problem!
- Hey hey hey!

123
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,319
We don't kill the living.

124
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,784
That's funny coming from a man
who just put a gun to my head.

125
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,287
We may disagree
on some things,

126
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,081
not on this.
You put it down.

127
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,666
Go on.

128
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,881
- Come with me.
- Where are you taking me?

129
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,133
Somewhere safe.

130
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,227
I came to pay my respects.

131
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,664
Did I ever mention

132
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:03,751
how I lost my wife?

133
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,715
- Cancer, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

134
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:13,510
I dragged her to every doctor,

135
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,888
every test.

136
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:20,434
And after all the surgeries
and the chemos,

137
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:23,229
she was ready.

138
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,856
She accepted it, you know?

139
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,569
But I never could.

140
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:34,365
And I spent the last few years

141
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,076
so angry.

142
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,870
I felt so cheated.

143
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,460
Since she passed,

144
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:50,297
you girls were the first people...

145
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,093
that I cared anything for.

146
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,447
This is her birthday?

147
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,786
Her birthday was always like--

148
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,747
like a week long affair.

149
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:27,167
But I somehow always missed it.

150
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,295
I was away at college

151
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,006
or too busy for kid's parties.

152
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,592
She'd call all excited.

153
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,138
I always said that I'd make it home

154
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:42,308
and I really always meant to,

155
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:46,770
but I never made it
past that phone call.

156
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,982
I know things
are hard enough for you

157
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,193
without adding guilt
into the mix, huh?

158
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,356
( head squishes )

159
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:41,033
I'll do it. He's my husband.

160
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,202
( crying )

161
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,600
( groans )

162
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:15,150
( grunting )

163
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,789
( sobbing )

164
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,766
( shallow breathing )

165
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,026
( breathing )

166
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,579
Amy.

167
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,337
Amy, I'm sorry.

168
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,137
I'm sorry

169
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,932
for not ever being there.

170
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:14,686
I always thought
there'd be more time.

171
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,360
( growling )

172
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,877
I'm here now, Amy.

173
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,630
I'm here.

174
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,929
I love you.

175
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,098
( gunshot )

176
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,665
Say it.

177
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,752
Okay.

178
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,007
I'm thinking
if you'd have stayed here,

179
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,634
if you'd have looked
after your own--

180
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:31,430
instead you went off.
You took half our manpower with you.

181
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,433
I'm thinking maybe our losses
wouldn't have been so bad.

182
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,935
If we hadn't gone off
and brought those guns back

183
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,896
when we did, I think our losses
would have been a lot worse.

184
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,274
- Maybe the entire camp.
- ( truck approaching )

185
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,359
( exhales )

186
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:59,499
I still think it's a mistake
not burning these bodies.

187
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,710
It's what we said we'd do, right?

188
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,671
Burn 'em all, wasn't that the idea?

189
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,089
Shane:
At first.

190
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:07,799
The Chinaman gets
all emotional,

191
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,927
says it's not the thing to do,
we just follow him along?

192
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,515
These people need to know
who the hell's in charge here,

193
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,477
- what the rules are.
- There are no rules.

194
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,646
Lori:
Well, that's a problem.

195
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,899
We haven't had one minute
to hold onto anything of our old selves.

196
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:28,320
We need time to mourn
and we need to bury our dead.

197
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,405
It's what people do.

198
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,993
Oh no.

199
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,371
No no no no.

200
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,582
No, not this, please.

201
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,673
( groans )

202
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,175
- ( panting )
- ( zombies growling )

203
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,597
No no no.

204
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,225
Oh, no no no.

205
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:01,353
- No no.
- ( people scream )

206
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,440
( panting )

207
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,864
( crying )
I can do it. I can do it.

208
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,659
I can do it!
I can do it.

209
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,304
( crying )

210
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,814
Dale: Hey.

211
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,527
( panting )

212
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,036
Burying other people
is bad enough,

213
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,247
- but the thought of one of us--
- Lori: Shh.

214
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:05,041
Are we safe now, Dad?

215
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,753
Now that we're together?

216
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,880
I won't leave again.

217
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,090
I promise you that.
Not for anything.

218
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,596
Now give me a chance

219
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,556
to discuss some things
with your mom, okay?

220
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,600
- Yeah.
- Rick: All right.

221
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,518
All right.

222
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:33,361
Shane blames me for not being here.

223
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,322
Do you?

224
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:44,372
We got guns now.
We're stronger.

225
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,291
And we have fewer people.

226
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,835
That makes us weaker.

227
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:51,087
You want me to say
I think you were right?

228
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,340
I understand that.

229
00:18:56,385 --> 00:19:00,305
All I can say is that neither
one of you is entirely wrong.

230
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:03,308
It's the best I can do right now.

231
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,105
What about the CDC?

232
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,901
- Rick--
- We're at the ragged edge here.

233
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:16,029
We need relief and we got
a sick man who needs help.

234
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:17,906
I don't know
why people can't see that.

235
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,866
Well, look at their faces.

236
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:22,619
Look at mine.
We're all terrified.

237
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:26,164
If one of us suggested,
based on a hunch,

238
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,375
that we head toward that city,

239
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,460
you'd have no part of it.

240
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:35,382
Tell me something with certainty.

241
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,352
I love you.

242
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,026
That's-- that's all--
that's all I got.

243
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,780
I love you too.

244
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,537
( door opens )

245
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,706
( knocks )

246
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,669
His fever is worse.

247
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:15,005
You need anything?

248
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,631
Uh...

249
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,718
water.
Could use more water.

250
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:21,177
- Lori: I'll get some.
- Okay.

251
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,722
Lori:
Carol, you help me?

252
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:38,153
You save a grave for me?

253
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,240
Nobody wants that.

254
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:45,076
Jim:
It's not about what you want.

255
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:50,665
That, uh-- that sound you hear,

256
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,835
that's God laughing
while you make plans.

257
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:03,094
What I want, Jim, if--

258
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:05,931
if God allows,

259
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,683
is to get you some help.

260
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,393
( groans )

261
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,687
( coughing )

262
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,234
( spits )

263
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,373
( groans, inhales deeply )

264
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,417
( coughs )

265
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,548
Watch the mangroves.

266
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,802
Their roots will gouge
the whole boat.

267
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,514
You know that, right?

268
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:51,768
Amy is there swimming.

269
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:57,190
You'll watch the boat, right?

270
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:59,484
You said you would.

271
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,738
I'll watch the boat.

272
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:06,074
Don't worry.

273
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,913
Okay.

274
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,719
I need you to help talk
some sense into Rick.

275
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:32,017
Look, this CDC thing,
Lori, it's a mistake.

276
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,020
So you're backing him?

277
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,105
What else would I do?
He's my husband.

278
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,649
Look, it may be time
for you to play the dutiful wife,

279
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:41,443
but you can't tell me
that fixing your marriage

280
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,361
is worth putting
people's lives at risk.

281
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:44,863
I think folks around here
can make up their minds

282
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:47,157
without bringing my marriage into it.

283
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,325
It's a habit you need to break.

284
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:52,203
I guess I'll just add it to the list

285
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,997
of habits that I'm breaking

286
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:55,665
whether I like it or not.

287
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:00,128
What habits?

288
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:04,215
Just talking about
my need for a plan, man.

289
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,469
So what is it?
Are we leaving or not?

290
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,679
Maybe y'all just want to stay here.

291
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:12,015
We could hang some more tin cans.

292
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:13,641
We can't stay here.
We both know that.

293
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,895
I was just telling Shane I think
we should trust your gut.

294
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:28,239
Let's go do our sweep.

295
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,834
Shane:
Tell you what, man,

296
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:42,212
these people, man,
they're not convinced.

297
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,797
You know?

298
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,049
You head to the CDC,

299
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:48,218
you might be on your own.

300
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,762
You gotta really consider
whether you want

301
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,889
to put Lori and Carl
in that kind of spot.

302
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:55,558
I got to do
what's best for my family.

303
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,811
Best for your family?
What's that?

304
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:01,106
- Exposing them to all kinds of risks?
- As opposed to what?

305
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,900
Crossing 100 miles
of hostile territory?

306
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:07,570
If we're looking for a lifeline,
I say swim toward the closest ship,

307
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:10,031
not further out to sea.

308
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,950
Why can't you back me up?

309
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:14,702
Shane:
Look, I want to. It's just...

310
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,580
I don't see it.

311
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:20,125
If it was your family,
you'd feel differently.

312
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,715
What did you say to me?

313
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,053
I kept 'em safe, man.

314
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:35,473
I looked after them like they were--
no, they were my own.

315
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,642
- That's what I did, Rick.
- Shane, I didn't mean it that way.

316
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,853
Well, how'd you mean it?

317
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,479
Go on, man. How'd you mean it?

318
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,649
( sighs )
You're misinterpreting me, man.

319
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,442
- All right.
- You're just hearing it wrong.

320
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,862
- Yeah?
- Look, you know--

321
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:52,740
you know I can never
repay that debt, okay?

322
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,577
( branch snaps )

323
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,997
Jesus.

324
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,168
( chuckles )

325
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,339
I know.

326
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:54,010
Gonna have to start wearing
reflective vests out here.

327
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,057
Seriously.

328
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:02,393
Come on, man.

329
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,065
Come on, man, let's go.

330
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:09,234
Nothing out here.

331
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:27,293
Shane:
I've, uh--

332
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,796
I've been thinking
about Rick's plan.

333
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:31,756
Now look, there are no--

334
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:34,300
there are no guarantees
either way.

335
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:37,136
I'll be the first one to admit that.

336
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,555
I've known this man a long time.

337
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,558
I trust his instincts.

338
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:49,148
I say the most important thing here
is we need to stay together.

339
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:56,114
So those of you that agree,

340
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:58,032
we leave first thing
in the morning.

341
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:01,911
Okay?

342
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,460
- ( walkie-talkie squawks )
- We're moving out,

343
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,297
leaving the quarry.

344
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,966
If you heard me yesterday,
you may be coming here.

345
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:18,970
If you are, we'll be gone
by the time you arrive.

346
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:23,433
I'm leaving a note
and map behind for you

347
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,310
taped to a red car

348
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,770
so you can follow our trail.

349
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,898
We're heading to the CDC.

350
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,026
If there's anything left,
it's got to be there,

351
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,986
don't you think?

352
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,406
Morgan...

353
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:42,160
I hope you were right
about that place.

354
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,414
I need you to be.

355
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,168
( gasps )

356
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,754
( muffled talking )

357
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,216
( coughs )

358
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,135
Shane:
Everybody listen up.

359
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:02,096
Those of you with CBs,
we're gonna be on channel 40.

360
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:04,015
Let's keep the chatter down, okay?

361
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:07,143
Now you got a problem,
don't have a CB,

362
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:09,479
can't get a signal or anything at all,
you're gonna hit your horn one time.

363
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,439
That'll stop the caravan.

364
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:14,484
- Any questions?
- Morales: We're, uh--

365
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:17,111
we're not going.

366
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,991
Woman:
We have family in Birmingham.

367
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,160
We want to be
with our people.

368
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:26,371
You go on your own, you won't
have anyone to watch your back.

369
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,414
Morales:
We'll take the chance.

370
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:30,875
I got to do what's best
for my family.

371
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:34,128
- You sure?
- Morales: We talked about it.

372
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:36,631
We're sure.

373
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,383
All right.

374
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,301
- Shane.
- Yeah, all right.

375
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,595
- Shane: .357?
- Rick: Yeah.

376
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,519
The box is half full.

377
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:56,275
Thank you all... for everything.

378
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,361
- Lori: Come here.
- ( crying )

379
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:00,154
Shane:
Good luck, man.

380
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,407
- Morales: Appreciate it.
- Shane: Yeah.

381
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,576
- Bye.
- ( Sophia crying )

382
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,745
Woman:
Thank you.

383
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:10,081
Bye.

384
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,168
Channel 40
if you change your minds.

385
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,045
- All right?
- Yeah.

386
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:18,339
Carol: I know.

387
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,928
What makes you think
our odds are any better?

388
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:27,181
Come on. Let's go.

389
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:30,226
- Let's move out.
- ( engines start )

390
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:54,477
( groaning )

391
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,610
( hissing )

392
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:04,779
I told you we'd never
get far on that hose.

393
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:07,532
I said I needed the one
from the cube van.

394
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,700
Can you jury-rig it?

395
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,702
That's all it's been so far.

396
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,121
It's more duct tape than hose.

397
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,499
And I'm out of duct tape.

398
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,544
Shane:
I see something up ahead.

399
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,547
A gas station if we're lucky.

400
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,049
Y'all, Jim--

401
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:27,969
it's bad. I don't think
he can take anymore.

402
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,472
Hey, Rick, you want
to hold down the fort?

403
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,349
I'll drive ahead,
see what I can bring back.

404
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:35,768
T-Dog: Yeah, I'll come along too
and I'll back you up.

405
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,436
Shane:
Y'all keep your eyes open now.

406
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,188
We'll be right back.

407
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,610
( jeep door opens, closes )

408
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,904
( engine starts, revs )

409
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:48,489
We'll be back on the road soon.

410
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,908
Jim:
Oh no. Christ.

411
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,369
My bones--

412
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:54,954
my bones are like glass.

413
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:56,455
Every little bump--

414
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:59,500
God, this ride is killing me.

415
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:02,169
Leave me here.

416
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,924
I'm done.

417
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,345
Just leave me.

418
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:14,265
I want to be with my family.

419
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:20,438
They're all dead.

420
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:24,567
I don't think you know
what you're asking.

421
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:28,070
The fever-- you've been delirious
more often than not.

422
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:30,114
I know.
Don't you think I know?

423
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,950
( groans )

424
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,496
I'm clear now.

425
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,082
In five minutes I may not be.

426
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,502
Rick, I know what I'm asking.

427
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,421
I want this.

428
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,467
Leave me here.

429
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:51,636
Now that's on me.

430
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,721
Okay?

431
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:55,931
My decision.

432
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,643
Not your failure.

433
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:05,941
It's what he says he wants.

434
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,694
And he's lucid?

435
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:10,655
He seems to be.

436
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,032
I would say yes.

437
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,535
Dale: Back in the camp
when I said Daryl might be right

438
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,663
and you shut me down,

439
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,998
you misunderstood.

440
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:24,251
I would never go along

441
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,088
with callously killing a man.

442
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,507
I was just gonna suggest

443
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:33,636
that we ask Jim what he wants.

444
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,015
And I think we have an answer.

445
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,477
Shane:
We just leave him here?

446
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:43,646
We take off?

447
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:46,357
Man, I'm not sure
I could live with that.

448
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:47,817
Lori:
It's not your call,

449
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,194
either one of you.

450
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:55,866
- Rick: Yeah. That's it.
- ( Jim groans )

451
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,536
( breathing heavily )

452
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:04,291
Hey, another damn tree.

453
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,210
( chuckles )

454
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:08,963
Hey, Jim--

455
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:11,340
I mean, you know
it doesn't need to be this.

456
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:13,676
No.

457
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:16,595
It's good.

458
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,806
The breeze feels nice.

459
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:20,891
Okay.

460
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,393
All right.

461
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,027
Just close your eyes, sweetie.

462
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,904
Don't fight.

463
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:50,254
Jim, do you want this?

464
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:52,923
Jim: No.

465
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,135
You'll need it.

466
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,473
I'm okay.

467
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,643
I'm okay.

468
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,816
Oh. Hey.

469
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,446
Thanks for, uh--

470
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:16,864
for fighting for us.

471
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:19,742
Okay.
( breathing loudly )

472
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:09,875
( cars starting )

473
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:33,691
( beeping )

474
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:38,445
Jenner here.

475
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:42,032
It's day 194
since Wildfire was declared

476
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,411
and 63 days since the disease
abruptly went global.

477
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:48,372
There's no clinical progress to report.

478
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:55,045
Item-- I finally got the scrubbers

479
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,547
in the east sector
shut down to save power.

480
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,007
Wish I could have
done it a month ago,

481
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,550
but it took me that long
to figure it out.

482
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,135
Too bad I never studied
engineering.

483
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:02,720
Could have saved
a lot of amps.

484
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:05,890
Item-- I'm still not sleeping well.

485
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,726
Can't seem
to keep regular hours.

486
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:11,061
Living underground doesn't help,

487
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,230
not knowing if it's day or night.

488
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:17,985
I'm just feeling
very off-kilter these days.

489
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,407
( beeping )

490
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,577
- ( beeps )
- ( door hisses )

491
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,871
( classical score playing )

492
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:40,215
( beeps )

493
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:06,408
( computer beeps )

494
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,513
( alarm blaring )

495
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,475
Computer voice:
Alert status.

496
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:34,311
Air qualifiers indicate
corrosive fumes.

497
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,730
All personnel
must clear the room.

498
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:40,401
Corrosive element is
deemed poisonous if inhaled.

499
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:57,960
All personnel clear.

500
00:38:58,128 --> 00:39:01,338
- Full decontamination in effect.
- No!

501
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:15,144
Full decontamination complete.

502
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,402
The TS-19 samples are gone.

503
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:26,780
The tragedy of their loss
cannot be overstated.

504
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,702
They were
our freshest samples by far.

505
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,956
None of the other samples
we gathered even came close.

506
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,460
Those are necrotic,

507
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,546
useless dead flesh.

508
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:50,012
I don't even know
why I'm talking to you.

509
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,933
I bet there isn't
a single son of a bitch

510
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,352
out there still listening, is there?

511
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:03,192
Is there?

512
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:07,738
Fine.

513
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:10,532
Saves me the embarrassment.

514
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:19,291
I think tomorrow
I'm gonna blow my brains out.

515
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:23,921
I haven't decided.

516
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,383
But tonight,

517
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,761
I'm getting drunk.

518
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,765
( pouring drink )

519
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:41,146
Speaking of which,

520
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,774
how far do you think
I can chuck this, huh?

521
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,860
Pretty far I bet.

522
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,283
- ( glass shatters )
- Oh!

523
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,619
It is out of the stadium!

524
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:04,795
( flies buzzing )

525
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:27,985
( people coughing )

526
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:29,528
( cocks gun )

527
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:32,990
( Shane whispering ) All right,
everybody. Keep moving. Go on.

528
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:35,868
Stay quiet. Let's go.

529
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,555
- ( chattering )
- Rick: Keep moving. Stay together.

530
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:59,516
- Keep moving. Come on.
- Shane: Shh.

531
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,396
- Lori: Carol.
- Rick: Shh.

532
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:06,273
Glenn: Oh, God.

533
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,699
( alarm beeping )

534
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:31,006
No.

535
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:33,258
Rick:
Keep it together. Come on.

536
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:35,427
Lori:
We're almost there, baby.

537
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:37,054
Almost there.

538
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:42,226
- ( rattles )
- Shane: Nothing?

539
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,606
( pounds on door )

540
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:49,733
T-Dog:
There's nobody here.

541
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,985
Then why are
these shutters down?

542
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:53,570
- Daryl: Walkers!
- Lori: Baby, come on.

543
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:56,031
- ( guns cock )
- ( child whimpering )

544
00:42:58,243 --> 00:43:00,077
Daryl:
You led us into a graveyard!

545
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:02,412
- Dale: He made a call.
- Daryl: It was the wrong damn call!

546
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,998
Just shut up. You hear me?
Shut up. Shut up!

547
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,084
- Rick, this is a dead end.
- Where are we gonna go?

548
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:09,211
Shane:
Do you hear me? No blame.

549
00:43:09,379 --> 00:43:11,421
She's right. We can't be here,
this close to the city after dark.

550
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:15,592
Fort Benning, Rick--
still an option.

551
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,512
Andrea: On what?
No food, no fuel. That's 100 miles.

552
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,264
- 125. I checked the map.
- Lori: Forget Fort Benning.

553
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,474
We need answers tonight, now.

554
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:24,601
- Well, think of something.
- Glenn: Come on, let's go.

555
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:27,854
- T-Dog: Let's get out of here.
- Glenn: Let's go. Please.

556
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,482
- ( whirrs )
- Shane: All right, back to the cars.

557
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,859
- Let's go. Move.
- The camera-- it moved.

558
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:36,530
- You imagined it.
- It moved.

559
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:39,324
- It moved.
- Rick, it is dead, man.

560
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:42,619
It's an automated device.
It's gears, okay?

561
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,288
They're just winding down.
Now come on.

562
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,790
- No, just go away.
- Shane: Man, just listen to me.

563
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,875
Look around this place.
It's dead, okay?

564
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,461
It's dead.
You need to let it go, Rick.

565
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,297
Lori:
Rick, there's nobody here!

566
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,341
I know you're in there.
I know you can hear me.

567
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:59,303
- Shane: Get back to the cars now!
- Rick: Please, we're desperate.

568
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,638
Please help us.
We have women, children,

569
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:03,807
- no food, hardly any gas left.
- Rick.

570
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,475
- There's nobody here.
- We have nowhere else to go.

571
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,644
- ( pounds on door )
- Shane: Keep your eyes open.

572
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:10,480
If you don't let us in,
you're killing us!

573
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,442
- Please!
- Shane: Come on, buddy, let's go.

574
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:14,985
- Let's go.
- Rick: Please help us.

575
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:16,987
( people shouting )

576
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:20,240
You're killing us! You're killing us!

577
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:22,534
You're killing us!

578
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:27,205
( clangs )

579
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,374
( gas hissing )

580
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:41,053
( theme music playing )
