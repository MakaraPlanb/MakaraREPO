00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,083
<i>-The phone's over there, honey.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

163
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,708
<i>-Gosh. I hope it's nothing too serious.</i>
<i>-Hello?</i>

164
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,208
<i>What's going on with you?</i>

165
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,166
<i>What? Uh...</i>

166
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,625
<i>[chuckles] What do you mean, Dad?</i>

167
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,125
<i>Why aren't you texting me back?</i>

168
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,708
<i>Well... what?</i>

169
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,458
<i>Um... oh, my God!</i>

170
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:22,291
<i>That's horrible, horrible news </i>
<i>about Aunt, um...</i>

171
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,416
<i>Rose.</i>

172
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,250
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

173
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,375
<i>-No.</i>
<i>-Uh...</i>

174
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,666
<i>-Could I please have a moment in private?</i>
<i>-Sure.</i>

175
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:32,791
<i>Just give me a second.</i>

176
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:36,416
<i>I'm stepping into the office</i>
<i>to take a second to process this.</i>

177
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,791
<i>Why are you pretending to be my dad?</i>

178
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,083
<i>It was the only way I could think</i>
<i>to get you on the phone.</i>

179
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,625
<i>Oh, that is not true.</i>

180

<i>[clatters]</i>

181
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,041
<i>No, it is true.</i>
<i>You barely call, and when you text,</i>

182
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,541
<i>you send</i>
<i>these weird two-word text messages</i>

183
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,625
<i>-like, you know, "Take care," "Talk soon."</i>
<i>-[sighs]</i>

184
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,416
<i>Are you breaking up with me?</i>

185
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,583
<i>What? No, no, no, no! The opposite.</i>

186
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,416
<i>Then what? Why?</i>
<i>Why are you ignoring me?</i>

187
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,291
<i>I... I don't know, I...</i>

188
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,583
<i>I guess I'm just...</i>

189
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:17,125
<i>I'm trying to be mature and not come off</i>
<i>like some clingy girlfriend.</i>

190
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,583
<i>Elle, I told you</i>
<i>that I wanted to make this work.</i>

191
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,583
<i>I know, but people always say that</i>
<i>when they leave.</i>

192
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,500
<i>I just wanted to give you space</i>

193
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,041
<i>so that you could figure out</i>
<i>if this is really what you want.</i>

194
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:32,125
<i>Space. Space. I don't--</i>
<i>I don't want space.</i>

195
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,208
<i>Space is not what I want, I told you.</i>

196
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,291
<i>I don't want space. I want you.</i>

197
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,166
<i>I want you around me all the time.</i>

198
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,375
<i>I want you with me right now, actually.</i>

199
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,750
<i>-I just-- I just want you, okay?</i>
<i>-[chuckles]</i>

200
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,875
<i>Text me, call me,</i>

201
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,541
<i>send me a messenger pigeon,</i>
<i>whatever it is, okay?</i>

202
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,916
<i>Whatever it is,</i>
<i>just don't give me space, okay?</i>

203
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,208
<i>Okay.</i>

204
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:53,416
<i>Okay.</i>

205
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:59,875
<i>[clears throat]</i>
<i>First up are Elle Evans and Lee Flynn.</i>

206
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,666
<i>Hello, everyone. Um, we are excited</i>
<i>about this year's fundraiser</i>

207
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,458
<i>and the opportunity before us.</i>

208
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:11,000
<i>Based on the earnings from last year,</i>
<i>we believe that it would be beneficial--</i>

209
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,208
<i>Everybody in favor of Dance Club doing</i>
<i>a kissing booth again for the fundraiser,</i>

210
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,291
<i>-please signify by saying "Aye."</i>
<i>-[all] Aye.</i>

211
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,833
<i>-[all] Aye.</i>
<i>-All those against, say "Nay."</i>

212
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,166
<i>Nay.</i>

213
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,875
<i>Wait, no, I don't actually know</i>
<i>why I just said that.</i>

214
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,166
<i>Let the record show the Ayes have it.</i>

215
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,958
<i>The kissing booth is approved.</i>

216
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,500
<i>-[cheering]</i>
<i>-[laughing]</i>

217
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,416
<i>Whoo!</i>

218
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:37,458
<i>And now that that's settled,</i>
<i>what we're all actually curious about is</i>

219
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,958
<i>who you've selected</i>
<i>for the lineup of kissers this time.</i>

220
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:44,708
<i>Because without Flynn as a headliner</i>
<i>to draw in business,</i>

221
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,958
<i>the booth may not do so well this year.</i>

222
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:50,208
<i>-Uh, that's a good point.</i>
<i>-Last year is gonna be hard to top.</i>

223
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,041
<i>-We--</i>
<i>-So hard.</i>

224
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,750
<i>Quite true. Thoughts?</i>

225
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,416
<i>Well, actually,</i>
<i>the thoughts we're having--</i>

226
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,041
<i>Right. Right. </i>
<i>That's a good point. Great point.</i>

227
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:03,500
<i>Well, you know, we have decided to keep</i>
<i>this year's list a secret. Yeah.</i>

228
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:07,416
<i>But do not worry because I know</i>
<i>who a lot of you are already thinking of,</i>

229
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,166
<i>and the answer is yes.</i>

230
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,666
<i>They will be there.</i>

231
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,875
<i>[all cheering]</i>

232
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,250
<i>Whoo! Thank you!</i>

233
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,458
<i>So, we didn't actually get anyone yet,</i>
<i>did we?</i>

234
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,833
<i>-That is correct, yes.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

235
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,750
<i>-[Noah] </i>So how's Aunt Rose?
<i>-Oh, come on.</i>

236
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,625
<i>-You can stop smirking now.</i>
<i>-[laughs]</i>

237
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,708
<i>I miss you, jerk.</i>

238
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,333
<i>I miss you more.</i>

239
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,333
<i>So, you Big Man on Campus yet?</i>

240
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,166
<i>[chuckles] No, not exactly.</i>

241
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,875
<i>It's kinda different here.</i>

242
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,333
<i>What do you mean?</i>

243
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,916
<i>Well, uh...</i>

244
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,291
<i>What's wrong?</i>

245
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,708
<i>Nothing! No, nothing's wrong. </i>
<i>Just... doesn't matter.</i>

246
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,875
<i>[sighs] Hey, it's okay to be homesick.</i>

247
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,875
<i>I'm-- I'm fine. I'm-- seriously, I'm fine.</i>
<i>It's just, you know...</i>

248
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:05,583
<i>What about you? How about you?</i>
<i>Have you applied to any more schools?</i>

249
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,541
<i>[groans]</i>
<i>Don't even get me started on Berkeley!</i>

250
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,958
<i>If Lee and I both don't get in, I'm...</i>

251
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,125
<i>Don't tell me you've only applied</i>
<i>to one school, Elle.</i>

252
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,458
<i>I know, </i>

253
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:18,166
<i>but it's literally the only school</i>
<i>we've ever talked about going to.</i>

254
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,208
<i>Well...</i>

255
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,458
<i>you know what you could do?</i>

256
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:26,000
<i>-[Elle] </i>My God. Is he about to ask me to--
<i>-Apply here.</i>

257
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,083
<i>[scoffs] As if I could get into Harvard.</i>

258
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,875
<i>[chuckles] Elle, there's over 30 schools</i>
<i>that you could apply to in Boston.</i>

259
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,333
<i>And your point being that at least one </i>
<i>of them would accept my sorry ass?</i>

260
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:40,333
<i>[laughing] No! My point being</i>
<i>that if you don't get into Berkeley...</i>

261
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,666
<i>maybe you can come to school here.</i>

262
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,166
<i>With me.</i>

263
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,666
<i>I'd like that.</i>

264
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,416
<i>[Elle] </i>You obviously couldn't see this,
but my heart just did a backflip.

265
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:53,416
<i>Um...</i>

266
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,041
<i>Okay, yeah, maybe I'll think about that.</i>

267
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,833
<i>Maybe you'll think about it.</i>

268
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,166
<i>-Okay, you can just think about it.</i>
-[chuckles]

269
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,041
<i>You know, all the books you have to read</i>
<i>if you go here, seriously...</i>

270
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,833
<i>[Elle sighs] </i>I couldn't help but think
about rule number 19,

271
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,333
<i>but here's the thing.</i>

272
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,208
<i>Who knows if I'd even get accepted</i>
<i>into a Boston school?</i>

273
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,625
<i>And if I didn't,</i>

274
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:18,583
<i>what would be the point in telling Lee now</i>
<i>and getting him upset over nothing?</i>

275
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,166
<i>Right?</i>

276
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,083
<i>[man] You have excellent grades,</i>

277
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:26,000

<i>near-perfect footwork.</i>

<i>But in freestyle,</i>
<i>the step accuracy is a given.</i>

<i>It's the choreography</i>
<i>that wins over the judges.</i>

00:57:34,458 --> 00:57:37,916
<i>and I wondered if it belongs to Chloe.</i>

1124

<i>Elle, I promise you, </i>

1125
00:57:39,291 --> 00:57:42,000
<i>I have absolutely no idea</i>
<i>how an earring got in my room.</i>

1126
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:45,416
<i>That may be so, but... it was there--</i>

1127
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,291
<i>Okay, I know what you thought.</i>

1128
00:57:47,833 --> 00:57:50,708
<i>All right.</i>
<i>But I'm not sleeping with Chloe, okay?</i>

1129
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:53,416
<i>I promise you. It could have been there</i>
<i>before I moved in.</i>

1130
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,416
<i>It could be my roommate's ex-girlfriend's.</i>
<i>There's countless reasons.</i>

1131
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,208
<i>It's just that knowing your past,</i>
<i>it's hard not to think--</i>

1132
00:57:59,291 --> 00:58:01,083
<i>That's not fair. At all.</i>

1133
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:04,125
<i>Have I ever given you reason to doubt me?</i>

1134
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,083
<i>No.</i>

1135
00:58:07,166 --> 00:58:10,000
<i>Okay. Then I'm asking you to trust me.</i>

1136
00:58:12,375 --> 00:58:13,208
<i>Please.</i>

1137
00:58:14,333 --> 00:58:17,041
<i>[Elle] </i>It was heartbreaking
to hear Noah talk this way,<i> </i>

1138
00:58:17,125 --> 00:58:21,000
<i>and I knew everything for us depended</i>
<i>on what I said next.</i>

1139
00:58:25,375 --> 00:58:26,208
<i>All right.</i>

1140
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:29,000
<i>I believe you.</i>

1141
00:58:30,083 --> 00:58:30,916
<i>Okay.</i>

1142
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,333
<i>I wish you'd brought it up sooner, but...</i>

1143
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:37,250
<i>I'm glad you told me.</i>

1144
00:58:38,416 --> 00:58:40,291
<i>[Elle] </i>When you're not sure 
where you stand,

1145

<i>You're missing all the steps.</i>

1148
00:59:00,791 --> 00:59:02,166
<i>How can we fix that?</i>

1149
00:59:02,958 --> 00:59:06,208
<i>Okay, listen. I'm not worried about that.</i>
<i>The precision will come.</i>

1150
00:59:06,291 --> 00:59:08,750
<i>What we need is something</i>
<i>that'll really blow the judges away.</i>

1151
00:59:08,833 --> 00:59:10,375
<i>We can't even get this routine right,</i>

1152
00:59:10,458 --> 00:59:13,208
<i>-and you want to make it more complicated?</i>
<i>-I want to make it more fun!</i>

1153
00:59:13,291 --> 00:59:14,833
<i>That's what the audience wants.</i>

1154
00:59:15,958 --> 00:59:16,958

01:00:00,666 --> 01:00:03,083
<i>I'm sorry. Okay?</i>
<i>You had a better shot with Marco,</i>

1164
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:06,000

<i>Be happy, I guess.</i>

<i>Me?</i>

01:04:07,583 --> 01:04:09,125
<i>You know what you want,</i>
<i>and you go after it.</i>

1241

<i>No.</i>

1242
01:04:10,166 --> 01:04:12,458
<i>No, no. </i>
<i>That is the wrong impression of me.</i>

1243

<i>Well, I was gonna say that I...</i>

1247
01:04:24,541 --> 01:04:26,583
<i>admire </i>you<i> for just wanting to be happy.</i>

1248
01:04:32,291 --> 01:04:34,625
<i>I really am grateful for your help,</i>
<i>by the way.</i>

1249
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:38,833
<i>I'm not exactly rich,</i>
<i>so this is is kinda like my moonshot </i>

<i>to pick where I wanna go to school.</i>

1251
01:04:42,166 --> 01:04:43,000
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1252
01:04:44,708 --> 01:04:47,708
<i>It's like something amazing</i>
<i>that you want really badly, </i>

1253
01:04:47,791 --> 01:04:49,666
<i>but it's not super likely to happen.</i>

1254
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:51,833
<i>Like winning the DDM tournament.</i>

1255
01:04:52,583 --> 01:04:53,500
<i>No pressure.</i>

1256
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:55,333
<i>Hmm.</i>

1257
01:04:56,208 --> 01:04:57,083
<i>"Moonshot."</i>

1258
01:04:58,291 --> 01:04:59,625
<i>Feels like pressure.</i>

1259
01:04:59,708 --> 01:05:03,291
<i>-Actually, it is. Yeah. Tons of pressure.</i>
<i>-[both laughing]</i>

1260
01:05:10,541 --> 01:05:14,041
<i>[Marco] So... Noah's in Boston and...</i>

1261
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,250
<i>and I mean...</i>

1262
01:05:18,583 --> 01:05:22,125
<i>I don't need to get into all the details,</i>
<i>but there's this girl...</i>

1263
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:24,416
<i>And you think he's involved with her?</i>

1264
01:05:24,833 --> 01:05:26,250
<i>I don't know. I mean...</i>

1265
01:05:27,291 --> 01:05:28,750
<i>I mean, he says he's not.</i>

1266
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:34,916
<i>It's funny 'cause when he left,</i>
<i>I kinda had just assumed </i>

1267
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,666
<i>that he would meet someone else</i>

1268
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:39,208
<i>and then it would just be over for us,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

1269
01:05:41,875 --> 01:05:44,166
<i>Do you think</i>
<i>you and Noah were meant to be together?</i>

1270
01:05:47,625 --> 01:05:48,958
<i>I always thought we were.</i>

1271
01:05:50,125 --> 01:05:51,416
<i>But now...</i>

1272
01:05:53,333 --> 01:05:54,166
<i>I don't know.</i>

1273
01:05:57,208 --> 01:05:59,833
<i>It's like I'm trying so hard</i>
<i>to hold on to this...</i>

1274
01:06:00,875 --> 01:06:03,875
<i>thing, and it just feels</i>
<i>like it's slipping away.</i>

1275
01:06:10,375 --> 01:06:11,500
<i>I don't know Flynn,</i>

1276
01:06:12,958 --> 01:06:15,166
<i>but if I found someone who I loved,</i>

1277
01:06:16,208 --> 01:06:19,083
<i>that was smart and funny</i>

1278
01:06:19,791 --> 01:06:21,458
<i>and liked the same stuff I liked,</i>

1279
01:06:23,708 --> 01:06:25,500
<i>I'd never make her feel like that.</i>

1280
01:06:28,125 --> 01:06:29,708
<i>Wouldn't let her get away, huh?</i>

1281
01:06:30,875 --> 01:06:32,458
<i>I don't see it like that.</i>

1282
01:06:33,083 --> 01:06:34,958
