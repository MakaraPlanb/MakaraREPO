1012
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,237
We found this old church,
and we decided to party in it,

00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,676
and my roommate wanted to play
truth or dare, so we did.

just started breaking stuff.

We were all being idiots. I don't...

1023

Our friend just had
a turn in the game.

1024
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,160
It wouldn't let her pick "truth."
Do you know why?

1025
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:19,320
It's how we played.
We called it "two truths and a dare."

1026
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,239
If two people pick truth in a row,
then the next person had to do a dare.

more fun that way.

Easy, Pen.

1032
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,273
He told me he was dared to
find a new group to play.

1033
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,512
And that it had to be at the mission.
He didn't have a choice.

1034
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,829
Of course he did.

1035
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,713
Okay, so
where is Carter now?

1036
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,478
I haven't talked to him
since he went back to Mexico.

1037
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,514
I thought that when he got a new
group to play, that we would be out.

1038
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,672
I can't believe he only
got five of you to play.

time before I had to go again.
