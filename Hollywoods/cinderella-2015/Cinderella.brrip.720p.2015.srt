1
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,820
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

2
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,920
<i>there was a girl called Ella.</i>

3
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,020
<i>And she saw the world</i>
<i>not always as it was,</i>

4
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,890
<i>but as perhaps it could be,</i>
<i>with just a little bit</i> <i> of magic.</i>

5
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,900
Ah, my darling!

6
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,900
<i>To her mother and father,</i>
<i>she was a princess.</i>

7
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,770
<i>True, she had no title,</i>
<i>nor crown, nor castle,</i>

8
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,240
<i>but she was the ruler of
her own little kingdom,</i>

9
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,110
<i>whose borders were the house
and meadow on the forest's edge</i>

10
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,950
<i>where her people had
lived for generations.</i>

11
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,320
<i>With Mr. Goose...</i>

12
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,590
<i>and all their animal family.</i>

13
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,430
Hello, there. What do
you think you're doing?

14
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,460
Let the little ones
have their share.

15
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,700
We don't want you getting
an upset stomach.

16
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,300
Oh, Gus-Gus,

17
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,640
you're a house mouse,
not a garden mouse.

18
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,410
Isn't he, Jacqueline?

19
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,070
And you mustn't eat Mr. Goose's food.

20
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,540
Isn't that right, Mummy?

21
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,910
Do you still believe that
they understand you?

22
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,880
Don't they, Mother? Oh, yes.

23
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,750
I believe that animals
listen and speak to us

24
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,320
if we only have the ear for it.

25
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,890
That's how we learn
to look after them.

26
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,620
Who looks after us?

27
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,930
Fairy godmothers, of course.

28
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,660
And do you believe in them?

29
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,130
I believe in everything.

30
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,470
Then I believe in
everything, too.

31
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,800
<i>Her father was a merchant</i>

32
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,510
<i>who went abroad</i>

33
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:29,140
<i>and brought tribute back from</i>
<i>all of Ella's subject lands.</i>

34
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,340
Ella!

35
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,310
Where are my girls,
my beautiful girls?

36
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,750
Where are my darlings?

37
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,790
<i>Ella missed him terribly
when he was away.</i>

38
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,260
<i>But she knew he
would always return.</i>

39
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,360
- There she is!
- Papa, welcome home!

40
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,290
How are you?

41
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,500
You've grown!

42
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,330
Haven't you, now?

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,500
There you go, sir.
What was that?

44
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,870
Oh, this?

45
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,040
I found it hanging on a tree.

46
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,780
I think there may be
something inside.

47
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,450
Oh, it's so pretty.

48
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,250
In French, that is un papillon.

49
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,400
Ouch. Ouch.

50
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,270
You're standing on my feet.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,040
Shall we?

52
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,970
Look, Mummy! I'm dancing!

53
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,940
Whee!

54
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,550
Little <i> papillon.</i>

55
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,190
<i>All was just as it should be.</i>

56
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,600
<i>They knew themselves to be the most
happy of families to live as they did</i>

57
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,500
<i>and to love each other so.</i>

58
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,630
<i>But sorrow can
come to any kingdom,</i>

59
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,460
<i>no matter how happy.</i>

60
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,040
<i>And so it came to Ella's home.</i>

61
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,080
I'm so sorry.

62
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,480
Thank you, Doctor.

63
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,980
This must have been
very difficult for you.

64
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,320
Come.

65
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,290
Ella.

66
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,640
Ella, my darling.

67
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,510
I want to tell you a secret.

68
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,280
A great secret that
will see you through

69
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,910
all the trials that
life can offer.

70
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,480
You must always remember this.

71
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,920
Have courage and be kind.

72
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,620
You have more kindness
in your little finger

73
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,660
than most people possess
in their whole body.

74
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,930
And it has power,
more than you know.

75
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,770
- And magic.
- Magic?

76
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,010
Have courage and be
kind, my darling.

77
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,940
Will you promise me?

78
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,380
I promise.

79
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,210
Good.

80
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,050
Good.

81
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,420
And...

82
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,260
I must go very soon, my love.

83
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,630
Please forgive me.

84
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,460
Of course I forgive you.

85
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,440
I love you.

86
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,240
I love you, my darling.

87
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,380
I love you.

88
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,770
<i>Time passed, and
pain turned to memory.</i>

89
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,550
<i>In her heart, Ella
stayed the same.</i>

90
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,850
<i>For she remembered her
promise to her mother.</i>

91
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,360
<i>Have courage, and be kind.</i>

92
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,300
<i>Father, however,</i>
<i>was much changed.</i>

93
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,330
<i>But he hoped for better times.</i>

94
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,800
"And thence home,

95
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,710
"and my wife and I singing,
to our great content,

96
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,310
"and if ever there were a man
happier in his fortunes,

97
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,140
"I know him not."

98
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,080
Thus ends Mr. Pepys for today.

99
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,580
I do love a happy
ending, don't you?

100
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,550
They're quite my favorite sort.

101
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,060
As well they should be.

102
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,490
Ella...

103
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:50,130
I have come to the conclusion
that it's time, perhaps...

104
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,070
to begin a new chapter.

105
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,600
Indeed, Father?

106
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,840
You'll recall that some
time ago, in my travels,

107
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,910
I made the acquaintance
of Sir Francis Tremaine.

108
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,510
Yes.

109
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,010
The Master of the Mercer's
Guild, is he not?

110
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,850
Was.

111
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,250
The poor man has died, alas.

112
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,580
His widow,

113
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:15,690
an honorable woman,
finds herself alone,

114
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,720
though still in the
prime of her life.

115
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,600
You're worried about telling me.

116
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,100
But you mustn't be.

117
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,600
Not if it will lead
to your happiness.

118
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,700
Yes.

119
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,770
Happiness.

120
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:38,340
Do you think I may be
allowed one last chance,

121
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,110
even though I thought such
things were done with for good?

122
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,720
Of course I do, Father.

123
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,460
She'll merely be
your stepmother.

124
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,290
And you'll have two lovely
sisters to keep you company.

125
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,600
Have courage, be kind.

126
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,580
Welcome, ladies. Welcome!

127
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,080
She's skinny as a broomstick!

128
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,620
And that stringy hair!

129
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,760
You're very nice.

130
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,590
Welcome. I'm so
happy to meet you.

131
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,690
You have such pretty hair.

132
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,390
Thank you. You should
have it styled.

133
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,430
Oh. I'm sure you're right.

134
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,860
Would you like a tour of the house?
What did she say?

135
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,930
She wants to show us
around her farmhouse.

136
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,240
She's proud of it, I think.
Do they keep animals inside?

137
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,410
How charming. How
perfectly charming.

138
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,680
Lucifer.

139
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,080
<i>Her stepmother-to-be</i>

140
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,280
<i>was a woman of keen feeling</i>
<i>and refined taste.</i>

141
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,890
<i>And she, too, had known grief.</i>

142
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,260
<i>But she wore it</i>
<i>wonderfully well.</i>

143
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:31,420
You did not say your
daughter was so beautiful.

144
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,660
Oh, she takes after her...

145
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,730
Her mother.

146
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,570
Just so.

147
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,600
- What does Mummy mean?
- What's so charming about it?

148
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,840
She's lying. That's
just good manners.

149
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,170
Shut up.

150
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,240
How long has your
family lived here?

151
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,010
Over 200 years.

152
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,910
And in all that time, they
never thought to decorate?

153
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,680
Anastasia, hush.

154
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,850
They'll think you
are in earnest.

155
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,150
<i>Ella's stepmother,</i>

156
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,290
<i>high-spirited lady</i>
<i>that she was,</i>

157
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:04,790
<i>set out to restore life</i>
<i>and laughter to the house.</i>

158
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,530
Oh, you are awful, Baron.

159
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,430
Ah, fortune favors me again.

160
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,380
Well, look who's having
a party of their own.

161
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:29,550
Jacqueline, Teddy,
Matilda, greedy Gus-Gus.

162
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,450
Uh-oh.

163
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,360
Just what...

164
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,790
Yes, what do you think
you're up to, Lucifer?

165
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:43,060
Jacqueline is my guest, and the
eating of guests is not allowed.

166
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,970
Go on, now. You've plenty of
cat food to keep you happy.

167
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,900
We ladies must help one another.

168
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,380
You're missing the party.

169
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,580
Oh, I imagine it's much
like all the other ones.

170
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,920
And I'm leaving first thing, El.

171
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,750
No. But you're...

172
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,820
You're hardly back
from the last trip.

173
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,760
Do you have to go?

174
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,930
It's just a few
months, my darling.

175
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,100
What would you like me to
bring you home from abroad?

176
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,500
You know, your sisters...

177
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,900
uh, stepsisters, have asked for

178
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,340
parasols and lace.

179
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,510
What will you have?

180
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,010
Bring me the first branch your
shoulder brushes on your journey.

181
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,750
That's a curious request.

182
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,420
Well, you'll have
to take it with you

183
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,280
on your way...

184
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,520
and think of me when
you look at it.

185
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,790
And when you bring it back, it
means that you'll be with it.

186
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,530
And that's what I really want.

187
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,070
For you to come back.

188
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:53,930
No matter what.

189
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,100
I will.

190
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,780
Ella, while I'm away,

191
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,050
I want you to be good
to your stepmother

192
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,980
and stepsisters, even
though they may be...

193
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,820
trying at times.

194
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,660
I promise. Thank you.

195
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,890
I always leave a part
of me behind, Ella.

196
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,000
Remember that.

197
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,070
And your mother's here, too,
though you see her not.

198
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,840
She's the very heart
of this place.

199
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,670
And that's why we must
cherish this house,

200
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,140
always, for her.

201
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,010
I miss her.

202
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,980
Do you?

203
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,150
Very much.

204
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,200
- Remember the lace!
- I simply must have it!

205
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,640
And my parasol!

206
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,840
For my complexion!

207
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,340
That means skin,
if you don't know!

208
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,380
Bye!

209
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,110
Bye, Ella!

210
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,220
I love you!

211
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,950
I love you, too!

212
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,690
Bye!

213
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,880
Ella, dear.

214
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,090
Now, now. Mustn't blub.

215
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,390
Yes, Stepmother.

216
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,060
Oh, you needn't call me that.

217
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,770
"Madam" will do.

218
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,400
There isn't room for me
and all of your clothes!

219
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,740
Well, then make
yourself smaller!

220
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,240
Anastasia and Drisella

221
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,670
have always shared a room.

222
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,840
Such dear, affectionate girls.

223
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,780
Or... Or better yet,
disappear entirely!

224
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,250
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

225
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,920
Sometimes I could
scratch your eyes out!

226
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,620
I think they're finding the
sleeping quarters rather confining.

227
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:31,960
Oh, well, my bedroom's the biggest
besides yours and Father's.

228
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,860
Perhaps they'd like to share it.

229
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,700
What a wonderful idea.

230
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,700
What a good girl you are.

231
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,200
I can stay in the... The attic.

232
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,040
Quite so.

233
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,870
The attic?

234
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,780
Yes.

235
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:53,910
Oh, only temporarily, while I have
all the other rooms redecorated.

236
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,750
The attic's so nice and airy

237
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,420
and you'll be away from all
of our fuss and bother.

238
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:04,560
You'd be even more cozy if you kept all
this bric-a-brac up there with you.

239
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,030
Keep you amused.

240
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,600
Well...

241
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,730
no one shall disturb me here.

242
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,790
Oh, hello, Gus-Gus.

243
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,290
Oh...

244
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,490
Oh.

245
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,500
Go on, Gus-Gus, you can do it.

246
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,800
So this is where
you take refuge.

247
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,740
Me too, it would seem.

248
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,040
Right.

249
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,580
Who's going to help me?

250
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,740
Simpleton.

251
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,350
That is the last straw.

252
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,420
Our little sister, up there,
talking to the woodworm.

253
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,050
How very pleasant.

254
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,320
No cats...

255
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,160
and no stepsisters.

256
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,260
We have a halfwit for a sister.

257
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,500
I've got two.

258
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,400
I heard that.

259
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,170
Who is she talking to?
She's mad.

260
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,940
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Miss Ella.

261
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,440
Good morning, Tom!

262
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,950
Hello. Don't mind if I...

263
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,150
What a lovely Chantecler.
Well done.

264
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,360
Thanks.

265
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,290
'Morning. 'Morning.

266
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,560
Thank you, Miss Ella.

267
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,700
You're welcome.

268
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,700
Ella!

269
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,440
Wake up, girls! It's lunch time!

270
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,940
<i>Mornings did not agree</i>

271
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,380
<i>with Ella's stepsisters.</i>

272
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,220
<i>And they lacked accomplishment</i>

273
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,490
<i>in such domestic arts</i>
<i>as keeping house.</i>

274
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,220
<i>In fact, they lacked</i>
<i>accomplishment in any art.</i>

275
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,490
Oh.

276
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,260
Do shut up.

277
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,500
<i>Ella's great comfort</i>

278
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,870
<i>were the letters that Father</i>
<i>would send from his travels.</i>

279
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,310
<i>The weeks away</i>
<i>lengthened to months,</i>

280
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:16,410
<i>but every day would bring his
thoughts from some distant part.</i>

281
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,240
Miss Ella, it's the mail coach!

282
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,410
<i>Until late one afternoon...</i>

283
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,150
Farmer John?

284
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,050
Miss Ella.

285
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,890
It's your father, miss.

286
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,920
He took ill on the road.

287
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,960
He's passed on, miss.

288
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,900
He's gone.

289
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:43,000
To the end, he spoke
only of you, miss.

290
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:44,440
And your mother.

291
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,340
I was to give you this.

292
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,910
But what about my lace?

293
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,510
My parasol?

294
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,950
Can't you see? None
of that matters.

295
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,190
We're ruined.

296
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,760
How will we live?

297
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,200
Thank you.

298
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,500
It must have been very
difficult for you.

299
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,350
<i>How indeed to live.</i>

300
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,620
<i>Economies had to be taken.</i>

301
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,530
<i>Ella's stepmother
dismissed the household.</i>

302
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,010
<i>Her stepmother and stepsisters</i>

303
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,550
<i>ever misused her.</i>

304
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,720
<i>And by and by they
considered Ella</i>

305
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,350
<i>less a sister than a servant.</i>

306
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:46,420
<i>And so Ella was left</i>
<i>to do all the work.</i>

307
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:53,570
<i>This was a good thing, for it
distracted her from her grief.</i>

308
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,400
<i>At least that was what</i>
<i>her stepmother said.</i>

309
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,670
<i>And she and her two daughters</i>
<i>were more than happy</i>

310
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,140
<i>to provide Ella with lots</i>
<i>and lots of distraction.</i>

311
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:17,890
<i>In their defense, they did share
with her the very food they ate,</i>

312
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,490
<i>or rather, the scraps
from their table.</i>

313
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,700
<i>She had little in
the way of friends.</i>

314
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,100
<i>Well, her friends</i>
<i>were very little.</i>

315
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,700
There you are.

316
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,440
Have dinner with me, won't you?

317
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,840
<i>But those friends she had, she
treated with an open heart</i>

318
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,340
<i>and an open hand.</i>

319
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,180
Your table.

320
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,640
<i>Sometimes, by the
end of the day,</i>

321
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,110
<i>the drafty attic was too
cold to spend the night in,</i>

322
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,980
<i>so she lay by the dying</i>
<i>embers of the hearth</i>

323
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,480
<i>to keep warm.</i>

324
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,830
I thought breakfast was ready.

325
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,240
It is, madam.

326
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,670
I'm only mending the fire.

327
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:43,240
In future, can we not be
called until the work is done?

328
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,540
As you wish.

329
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,580
Ella, what's that on your face?

330
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,220
Madam?

331
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,820
It's ash from the fireplace.

332
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,020
Do clean yourself up.

333
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,690
You'll get cinders in our tea.

334
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:03,190
I've got a new name for her!
Cinderwench.

335
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,500
I couldn't bear
to look so dirty.

336
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,260
Oh, Dirty Ella.

337
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,530
Cinder-ella!

338
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,100
That's what we'll call you.

339
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,470
Oh, girls, you're too clever.

340
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,340
Who's this for?

341
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,350
Is there someone
we've forgotten?

342
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,610
It's my place.

343
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,320
It seems too much to expect
you to prepare breakfast,

344
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,150
serve it and still sit with us.

345
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:31,020
Wouldn't you prefer to eat when
all the work is done, Ella?

346
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,120
Or should I say, "Cinderella"?

347
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:34,860
Hmm?

348
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:22,010
<i>Cinderella.</i>

349
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,780
<i>Names have power,</i>
<i>like magic spells.</i>

350
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,380
<i>And of a sudden,</i>
<i>it seemed to her</i>

351
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,350
<i>that her stepmother</i>
<i>and stepsisters</i>

352
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,280
<i>had indeed transformed her</i>

353
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,450
<i>into merely a creature of ash</i>

354
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,650
<i>and toil.</i>

355
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,310
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

356
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:15,790
Run!

357
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,830
Quickly, my friend,
or they'll catch you!

358
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,360
Go!

359
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,830
Whoa! Easy!

360
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:29,110
<i>Perhaps it was just as well that
Ella's stepsisters were cruel.</i>

361
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,480
<i>For had she not run</i>
<i>to the forest,</i>

362
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,680
<i>she might never have
met the prince.</i>

363
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,420
- Easy! Easy!
- Whoa! Whoa!

364
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,120
Easy, boy!

365
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,320
Come on, boy, slow down!

366
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,960
Miss! Are you all right?

367
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,790
Hold on!

368
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,330
I'm all right, thank you!

369
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,430
That's fine. Whoa!

370
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

371
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,770
Whoa. Whoa.

372
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,540
Are you all right?
I'm all right,

373
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,610
but you've nearly frightened
the life out of him.

374
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,140
Who?

375
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,780
The stag.

376
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,040
What's he ever done to you

377
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,950
that you should chase him about?

378
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,620
I must confess I've
never met him before.

379
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,380
He is a friend of yours?

380
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,050
An acquaintance.

381
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,450
We met just now.

382
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,190
I looked into his eyes,

383
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,790
and he looked into mine,

384
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,360
and I just felt he had a great
deal left to do with his life.

385
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,660
That's all.

386
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,800
Miss, what do they call you?

387
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,000
Never mind what they call me.

388
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,570
You shouldn't be this
deep in the forest alone.

389
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:36,910
I'm not alone. I'm
with you, Mister...

390
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,740
What do they call you?

391
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,910
You don't know who I am?

392
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,950
That is...

393
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,320
They call me Kit.

394
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,580
Well, my father does

395
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,890
when he's in a good mood.

396
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,590
And...

397
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,060
where do you live, Mr. Kit?

398
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,430
At the palace.

399
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,930
My father's teaching
me his trade.

400
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:57,960
You're an apprentice?

401
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,730
Of a sort.

402
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,930
That's very fine.

403
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,770
Do they treat you well?

404
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,840
Better than I
deserve, most likely.

405
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,510
And you?

406
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,640
They treat me as well
as they're able.

407
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,010
I'm sorry.

408
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,680
It's not your doing.

409
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,850
Nor yours either, I'll bet.

410
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,790
It's not so very bad.

411
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,920
Others have it worse, I'm sure.

412
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,530
We must...

413
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:31,960
simply have courage and
be kind, mustn't we?

414
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,130
Yes.

415
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,700
You're right.

416
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,440
That's exactly how I feel.

417
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,080
Please don't let them hurt him.

418
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,550
But we're hunting, you see.
It's what's done.

419
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:53,050
Just because it's what's done doesn't
mean it's what should be done.

420
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,990
Right again.

421
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:57,560
Then,

422
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,690
you'll leave him
alone, won't you?

423
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,700
I will.

424
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,000
Thank you very much, Mr. Kit.

425
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,340
Ah.

426
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,740
There you are, Your High...
It's Kit! Kit!

427
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,670
Kit! I'm Kit. I'm on my way.

428
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:21,580
Well, we'd better get
a move on, Mr. Kit.

429
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,650
As I said.

430
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,450
On my way.

431
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,600
I hope to see you again, miss.

432
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,700
And I, you.

433
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:28,810
You sound as if you're the first
fellow ever to meet a pretty girl.

434
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,720
She wasn't a "pretty girl."

435
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,350
Well, she was a pretty girl,

436
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,750
but there was so
much more to her.

437
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,020
How much more? You've
only met her once.

438
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,760
How could you know
anything about her?

439
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,890
You told me you knew right
away when you met Mother.

440
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,660
That's different. Your
mother was a princess.

441
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,860
You would have loved her anyway.

442
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,930
I would never have seen her,

443
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:46,230
because it wouldn't
have been appropriate.

444
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:49,600
And my father would have
told me what I'm telling you

445
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,740
and I would have listened.

446
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,870
No, you wouldn't. Yes, I would.

447
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:52,900
No, you wouldn't. I would.

448
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:53,670
You wouldn't. You're right.

449
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,580
Well, how is he?

450
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,650
Your Majesty...

451
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:09,420
Never mind.

452
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,790
If it takes that long to work out
a way to say it, I already know.

453
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,860
Father...

454
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,770
Way of all flesh, boy.

455
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,140
Come.

456
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,170
We shall be late.

457
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:30,710
And punctuality is the...

458
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,780
...politeness of princes.

459
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,750
His Majesty, the King!

460
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,810
I'm sure your father spoke to you
of your behavior in the forest.

461
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,550
Is it any business of
yours, Grand Duke?

462
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:41,490
Your business is my business,
Your Royal Highness.

463
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:43,550
It will not do to let
the stag go free.

464
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,420
Just because it's what's done doesn't
mean it's what should be done.

465
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,960
Or something like that.

466
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,790
Master Phineus, master
of the paintbrush,

467
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,500
patiently awaits.

468
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,230
Make him look marriageable,
Master Phineus.

469
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:55,430
We must attract a
suitable bride,

470
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,170
even if he won't listen
to a word I say.

471
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:00,470
I shall endeavor to
please, Your Majesty.

472
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,640
But I can't work miracles.

473
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,680
A splendid canvas,
Master Phineus.

474
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,940
Thank you.

475
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,680
As if he knows
anything about art.

476
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,850
So, these portraits

477
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,650
will really be sent abroad?

478
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:14,250
To induce the high and mighty to
attend this ball you insist upon.

479
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,320
Which is a tradition.
Which is beloved.

480
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,860
At which you will
choose a bride.

481
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,420
Ah, fascinating.

482
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:24,700
If I must marry, could I not wed,
say, a good, honest country girl?

483
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:28,330
How many divisions will this "good,
honest country girl" provide us?

484
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:30,670
How will she make the
kingdom stronger?

485
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:34,370
We are a small kingdom amongst
great states, Your Royal Highness.

486
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:35,610
And it's a dangerous world.

487
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,980
Listen, boy.

488
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,310
Taking you up, Master Phineus.
Good.

489
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:44,220
I want to see you and
the kingdom safe.

490
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,120
All right, Father,

491
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,790
on one condition.

492
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:55,290
Let the invitations go to
everyone, not just the nobility.

493
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:57,500
The wars have brought
sorrow on us all.

494
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,800
What do you think?

495
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,630
Would that please the people?

496
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:03,000
It's beyond my
wit, Your Majesty.

497
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,740
But I wouldn't mind
a bit of a jolly.

498
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:09,210
I think we might
have made a bargain.

499
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,640
A ball for the people,

500
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,680
and a princess for the prince.

501
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,250
Sounds like a step in the right
direction, if you ask...

502
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,550
We didn't ask you.

503
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,150
I'm so sorry. Naughty
paint, naughty brush.

504
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,090
Down, please, Samson.

505
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,920
Haven't even got a cushion.

506
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,530
Right, down, down.
Not that... Oi!

507
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,390
I'm on the ground.

508
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,430
I am literally on the ground.
Sorry.

509
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:35,570
Actually this is a very
good angle for you.

510
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,230
Great nostrils. Could I
have a longer brush?

511
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,450
You don't look well, miss.

512
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:54,690
Not at all.

513
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:58,090
Why do you stay there,
when they treat you so?

514
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,190
Because I made my mother
and father a promise

515
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,560
to cherish the place
we were so happy.

516
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,260
They loved our house...

517
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:10,800
and now that they're gone,
I love it for them.

518
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,300
It's my home.

519
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:16,110
Hear ye! Hear ye!

520
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,640
Quiet!

521
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:22,150
"Know, "on this day,
two weeks hence,

522
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:24,820
"there shall be held,
at the palace,

523
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:27,120
"a Royal Ball.

524
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,650
"At said ball,

525
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,990
"in accordance with
ancient custom,

526
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:37,460
"the prince shall

"Furthermore, "at the
behest of the prince,

528
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:46,570

00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:49,070

00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,840
"is invited to attend.

531
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:59,380
"Such is the command of
our most noble king."

532
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,350
Excuse me, madam.

533
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,660
<i>Ella was enormously excited</i>

534
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,390
<i>to see Kit, the apprentice.</i>

535
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:11,200
<i>And her stepsisters</i>
<i>were mildly intrigued</i>

536
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,960
<i>by the notion of
meeting the prince.</i>

537
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,100
I shall trick him into loving me.
See if I don't!

538
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,700
This is the most hugest news!

539
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,270
Calm yourselves.

540
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,610
Now listen to me.

541
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:26,140
One of you must win the
heart of the prince.

542
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,350
Do that, and we can unwind the
debt in which we were ensnared

543
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,050
when we came to this backwater!

544
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:32,120
I, a princess?

545
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,120
Or rather, I, a princess?

546
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,860
Having delivered your news,

547
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,990
why are you still here?

548
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,960
You must return to
town right away

549
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,460
and tell that seamstress to run
us up three fine ball gowns.

550
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,200
Three?

551
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,130
That's very thoughtful of you.

552
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:51,300
What do you mean?

553
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,800
To think of me.

554
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,470
Think of you?

555
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,740
Mummy, she believes the
other dress is for her.

556
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,080
Poor, slow, little Cinders.

557
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,040
How embarrassing.

558
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,910
You're too ambitious
for your own good.

559
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:04,250
Oh, no. I only want
to see my friend.

560
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,820
Let me be very clear.

561
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:11,420
One gown for Anastasia,
one for Drisella,

562
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,590
and one for me!

563
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,090
She doesn't know
what that means.

564
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,570
Good. Right.

565
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:26,600
That's settled then.

566
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,340
Now go!

567
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,940
Every girl in the kingdom
will be chasing the prince.

568
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:34,250
You must get there first before the
seamstress is drowning in work!

569
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,780
Tell me what she said, Drisella.

570
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,350
I speak French, not Italian!

571
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,300
Wake up, Your Royal Highness.
You're in a daze.

572
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,600
I'm sorry.

573
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,200
You've been off since the hunt.

574
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:02,970
It's that wonderful girl. I
can't stop thinking about her.

575
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,540
But there are plenty of girls.

576
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:07,310
But her spirit, her goodness...

577
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,480
You don't suppose she
has a sister, do you?

578
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,080
I don't know.

579
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,820
I don't know anything about her.

580
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:16,150
Perhaps your mystery girl
may come to the ball.

581
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,990
That is why you threw the
doors open, is it not?

582
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,290
Captain.

583
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,460
It was for the benefit
of the people.

584
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,590
Of course.

585
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,830
How shallow of me.

586
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,500
And if she comes, then what?

587
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,600
Then you will tell
her you're a prince.

588
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,800
And a prince may take
whichever bride he wishes.

589
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,800
Ha! Ha?

590
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,170
Yes, "ha."

591
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:32,570
You know my father
and the Grand Duke

592
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,740
will only have me
marry a princess.

593
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,940
Well, if this girl from the
forest is as charming as you say,

594
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,080
they may change their minds.

595
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,080
<i>The day of the ball arrived</i>

596
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,020
<i>and the entire kingdom</i>

597
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,850
<i>held its breath</i>
<i>in anticipation.</i>

598
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,460
<i>You want me to be your queen?</i>

599
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,960
Who? Me?

600
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,160
Tighter.

601
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:57,330
Tighter!

602
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,100
Tighter.

603
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,530
That's it!

604
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:02,970
A vision, sister.

605
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:04,700
Likewise.

606
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,640
We must compete for
the prince's hand.

607
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,210
But let it not mean we harbor
dark thoughts against each other.

608
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:11,780
Of course not, dear sister.

609
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:15,280
I wouldn't dream of poisoning you
before we leave for the ball.

610
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,150
Oh, nor I of pushing you from a
moving carriage on the way there.

611
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:22,220
Or I of dashing your brains out
on the palace steps as we arrive.

612
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,220
We are sisters, after all.

613
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,060
And blood is so much
thicker than water.

614
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,060
We shall let the prince decide.

615
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,690
What will he be like, I wonder?

616
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,470
What does it matter
what he's like?

617
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:37,740
He's rich beyond reason.

618
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:40,670
Wouldn't you like to know a bit
about him before you marry him?

619
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,240
Certainly not. It
might change my mind.

620
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,910
I bet you have never
ever spoken to a man.

621
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,580
Have you, moon-face?

622
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,210
I have, once.

623
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,920
To a gentleman.

624
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,920
Some menial, no doubt.

625
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,420
Some 'prentice.

626
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,050
He was an apprentice, yes.

627
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,320
All men are fools,
that's what Mama says.

628
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,160
The sooner you learn
that, the better.

629
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,890
The first dance, milady?

630
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,030
Prince Charming,
you're so naughty!

631
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,840
I want to try it.
No, I'm wearing it.

632
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,910
No! No!

633
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,280
<i>Not for the first time,</i>

634
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,020
<i>Ella actually felt pity</i>
<i>for these two schemers,</i>

635
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:29,090
<i>who could be every bit as ugly
within as they were fair without.</i>

636
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:30,920
My prince!

637
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,190
But I will be his queen!

638
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,700
<i>If her stepmother
would not have</i>

639
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,430
<i>a fourth dress made,</i>

640
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:43,300
<i>it seemed to Ella that</i>
<i>there was no reason why</i>

641
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,540
<i>she would not try</i>
<i>to run it up herself.</i>

642
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:50,810
<i>And besides, she did
have a little help.</i>

643
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:12,660
My dear girls.

644
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:16,270
To see you like this...

645
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:20,440
it makes me believe one of you
might just snare the prince.

646
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:25,010
And to think I have two
horses in the race!

647
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:28,850
I daresay no one in the kingdom
will outshine my daughters.

648
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,780
Cinderella?

649
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:36,150
It cost you nothing.

650
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,360
It was my mother's
old dress, you see.

651
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,790
And I took it up myself.

652
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:40,990
Ooh-la.

653
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:42,530
Cinderella at the ball!

654
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:44,700
No one wants a
servant for a bride.

655
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,260
After all I've done...

656
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,660
I don't want to ruin anything.

657
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,430
I don't even want
to meet the prince.

658
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,440
Oh, and you won't, because there's
no question of your going.

659
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,710
But, all of the maidens
of the land are invited,

660
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,210
by order of the king.

661
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:00,440
It is the king I am thinking of.

662
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,850
It would be an insult
to the royal personage

663
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:05,650
to take you to the palace
dressed in these old rags.

664
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:06,780
Rags?

665
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,890
This was my mother's.

666
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:13,890
Oh, I'm... sorry to
have to tell you...

667
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:16,630
but your mother's taste
was questionable.

668
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:20,400
This thing is so old-fashioned

669
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,730
it's practically
falling to pieces.

670
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,400
The shoulder's frayed.

671
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,210
- It's falling to bits.
- And this!

672
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:30,010
It's a ridiculous,
old-fashioned joke!

673
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,810
How could you?

674
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:36,680
How could I otherwise?

675
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:40,550
I will not have anyone associate
my daughters with you.

676
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,850
It would ruin their prospects

677
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,720
to be seen arriving with
a ragged servant girl.

678
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,720
Because that is what you are.

679
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:49,930
And that is what you
will always be.

680
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:52,160
Now mark my words!

681
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,770
You shall not go to the ball!

682
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:56,470
Go on, get going!

683
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,530
I'm sorry, Mother.

684
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,700
I'm sorry.

685
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:35,810
I said I'd have
courage, but I don't.

686
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:37,270
Not anymore.

687
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,380
I don't believe anymore.

688
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,260
Excuse me.

689
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:03,970
Can you help me, miss?

690
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:07,570
Just a little crust of bread,
or better, a cup of milk?

691
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:09,340
Yes.

692
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,840
Yes, yes, yes.

693
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,480
I think I can find
something for you.

694
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:23,350
Why are you crying?

695
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,760
Oh, it's nothing.

696
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,460
Nothing?

697
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,700
Nothing.

698
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,930
What is a bowl of milk? Nothing.

699
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:37,530
But kindness makes
it everything.

700
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:52,450
Now, I don't mean to hurry you, but
you really haven't got long, Ella.

701
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:54,620
How do you know me?

702
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,790
Who are you?

703
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:58,520
Who am I?

704
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,020
I should think you'd have
worked that one out.

705
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:04,160
I'm your hairy dogfather.

706
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,760
I mean, fairy godmother!

707
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,630
You can't be.

708
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,500
Why not?

709
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,240
They don't exist.

710
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,570
They're just made
up for children.

711
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:17,910
Didn't your own mother
believe in them?

712
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:18,810
Don't say no, because
I heard her.

713
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,310
You heard her?

714
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:23,150
Oh, fiddle-faddle,
fiddle-faddle.

715
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:25,050
Right! First things first.

716
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:28,420
Let me slip into something
more comfortable.

717
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:44,900
Mmm.

718
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:46,740
That's better.

719
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,670
Now, where was I?

720
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:54,210
How did you... Oh, yes.
Let's see.

721
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:57,680
What we need is something
that sort of says, "coach."

722
00:45:58,750 --> 00:45:59,620
Um...

723
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:01,420
Oh, that trough?

724
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,420
Doesn't really say "coach."

725
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:07,120
No, no, I'm liking
fruit and veg.

726
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:08,430
Do you grow watermelons?

727
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:09,590
No.

728
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,790
Cantaloupe?

729
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,960
I don't even know what that is.

730
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,130
Artichoke?

731
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:14,460
Kumquat?

732
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:15,530
Beef tomato?

733
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:18,370
We do have pumpkins.

734
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:19,440
Ah.

735
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,570
Pumpkins?

736
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:24,070
This will be a first for me.

737
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:24,980
Always interesting.

738
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,880
I don't usually
work with squashes.

739
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:28,710
Too mushy.

740
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:33,320
Let me see. Oh, that'll do.

741
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,620
Yes. Knife?

742
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:39,490
There you are. Thank
you, darling.

743
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:41,560
Hello, my strangely
orange vegetable friend.

744
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,560
A quick snip for you.

745
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:44,630
Ah, lovely!

746
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:46,160
Ooh, heavy pumpkin!

747
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:47,460
Look out, mices!

748
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:51,670
Oh, well. Never mind.

749
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:52,940
Let's do it here.

750
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,340
Do what here?

751
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:55,710
Turn the pumpkin
into a carriage.

752
00:46:58,180 --> 00:46:59,310
You're making me
nervous, actually.

753
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:00,740
Shall I shut my eyes?
It might be better.

754
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:04,680
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Let's just go for it.

755
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,650
Ah.

756
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,290
Well, something's
definitely happening.

757
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:13,460
You see, the trick is...

758
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:14,120
Actually, I've forgotten
what the trick is. Hmm.

759
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:19,630
I just thought, if it...

760
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:22,170
If it does get much bigger...
Yes?

761
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:24,100
Hang on.

762
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:30,310
Is that what you meant to do?

763
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:32,180
Do you think that's
what I meant to do?

764
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:34,610
Run! Run, darling!

765
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:41,520
Take cover!

766
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:03,940
There! One carriage.

767
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:07,540
You really are my
fairy godmother.

768
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:09,380
Of course.

769
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,910
I don't go about transforming
pumpkins for just anybody.

770
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,180
Now, where are those mice?

771
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:16,020
Mice? Yes.

772
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,420
Mice, mice, mice.

773
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:18,560
There they are.

774
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,260
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

775
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:33,670
Four white chargers.

776
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:35,710
Gus-Gus, how fine you look!

777
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:39,240
But how did you...
Now, where are we?

778
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:42,510
Got carriage, horses...
Uh, footmen!

779
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,180
Footmen?

780
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,280
Hello, lovely Mr. Lizard.

781
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:48,690
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

782
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,090
Hello!

783
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:00,600
You called?

784
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:05,040
Now, I need that coachman.

785
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,470
Coachman?

786
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:08,000
Did I say "coachman"?
I meant "goose."

787
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:17,050
I can't drive. I'm a goose.

788
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:21,320
Now, shoo!

789
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,720
Everyone into place,
no time to be lost!

790
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:25,720
Come on!

791
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,030
Fairy Godmother!

792
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,030
Yes, what?

793
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,660
My dress.

794
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:35,600
I can't go in this dress.

795
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,170
Can you mend it? Mend it?

796
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:38,670
No, no. I'll turn it
into something new.

797
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:40,740
Oh, no, please don't.

798
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,570
This was my mother's.

799
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:46,040
And I'd like to wear it
when I go to the palace.

800
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:50,680
It's almost like
taking her with me.

801
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,920
I understand.

802
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:57,350
But she wouldn't mind
if I gee it up a bit?

803
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,990
Wouldn't mind a nice blue?

804
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:00,090
No.

805
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:43,470
There.

806
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:45,570
It's beautiful.

807
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:46,940
She'd love it.

808
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:50,410
Now, come on. Off you go. Quick!

809
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:51,710
You'll be late!

810
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,210
I'm very new at this!

811
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:57,250
Oh, boy.

812
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,920
Stop that blooming coach!

813
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:01,990
Whoa!

814
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:08,830
Thank you.

815
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:10,390
Just a moment!

816
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,760
Are those the best you have?

817
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:16,500
It's all right. No
one will see them.

818
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,600
No, they'll ruin the whole look.
Quick, quick.

819
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,700
Take them off. Really
quite hideous.

820
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,770
Let's have something
new for a change.

821
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:23,810
I'm rather good at shoes.

822
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:35,290
But...

823
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:38,590
They're made of glass?

824
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:40,420
Yes.

825
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,790
And you'll find they're
really comfortable.

826
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:44,290
Ella, you really must go now.

827
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:46,460
Oh, Fairy Godmother?

828
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:47,960
What is it?

829
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:49,300
My stepmother and the girls?

830
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,800
Don't worry.

831
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,140
I'll make sure they
don't recognize you.

832
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:55,940
Now, off you go.

833
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,940
For you shall go to the ball.

834
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:03,710
- Ah, in you get.
- Oh, so lovely.

835
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:04,880
Oh, do stop wittering on.

836
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,720
Ella!

837
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,160
I almost forgot.

838
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,490
Remember, the magic
will only last so long.

839
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:17,960
With the last echo
of the last bell,

840
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,730
at the last stroke of midnight,

841
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:22,000
the spell will be broken

842
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,070
and all will return to
what it was before.

843
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:25,840
Midnight?

844
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,440
Midnight.

845
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,070
That's more than enough time.

846
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:31,670
Off you go then. Thank you.

847
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:32,810
Thank you.

848
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:35,910
Goosey, go!

849
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,750
Goodbye!

850
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:36,870
Chandeliers, aloft!

851
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:52,560
Princess Mei Mei of Fujian.

852
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:58,560
Princess Shahrzad
of the Seljuqs.

853
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:00,560
Your Highness!

854
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:05,000
Princess Chelina of Zaragosa!

855
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:09,170
Princess Imani of Shona!

856
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:16,180
Princess Hiina of the
Chrysanthemum Throne!

857
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:23,190
Lady Tremaine and her daughters.

858
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:29,930
The Lady Tremaine
and her daughters.

859
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:30,960
I'm Drisella.

860
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,400
And I'm Anastasia.

861
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,530
People will want to know.
I'm the clever one.

862
00:54:33,530 --> 00:54:35,370
I'm very beautiful.

863
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:38,900
The very clever Miss Drisella,

864
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,870
and the very
beautiful Anastasia.

865
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:44,170
Do come on!

866
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:51,210
The Lord Veneering.

867
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:54,320
Who are you looking for?

868
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:57,020
No one.

869
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:01,060
It's that girl in the
forest, isn't it?

870
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:03,660
That's why you were so
generous with the invitations.

871
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,400
Father, it was for the people.

872
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,530
I know you love the people, Kit.

873
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,570
But I also know that
your head's been turned.

874
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:16,340
But you've only met her
once, in the forest.

875
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,910
And you would have me marry
someone I met once, tonight.

876
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:20,680
A princess.

877
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:23,010
It's a princess or nothing.

878
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:30,190
- Hold the doors!
- One more coming in.

879
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:44,700
May I present Her
Royal Highness,

880
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:47,440
the Princess Chelina
of Zaragosa.

881
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,310
You are as handsome
as your picture.

882
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:59,450
And your little kingdom
is enchanting.

883
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:03,020
I hope the princess will not find
our "little kingdom" too confining.

884
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:10,030
Miss Ella.

885
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:12,060
Thank you.

886
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,310
I'm frightened, Mr. Lizard.

887
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:32,420
I'm only a girl, not a princess.

888
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:35,150
And I'm only a lizard,
not a footman.

889
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,220
Enjoy it while it lasts.

890
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:06,250
Your Majesty, Your
Royal Highness,

891
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:09,090
My Lords, ladies and gentlemen,

892
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:13,790
distinguished visitors
and people of our land,

893
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:18,360
the prince shall now choose his
partner for the first dance.

894
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:21,900
Let our ball commence!

895
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:56,270
Excuse me.

896
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:58,400
A thousand apologies,
Your Royal Highness.

897
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,700
I don't know what happened.

898
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:06,270
Mr. Kit.

899
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:10,240
It's you,

900
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:12,480
isn't it?

901
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,880
Just so.

902
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:18,650
Your Highness...

903
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:23,620
If I may... that is...

904
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:29,590
it would give me the
greatest pleasure,

905
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:32,760
if you would do me the honor of
letting me lead you through this...

906
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:33,830
the first...

907
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:38,940
Dance?

908
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,940
Yes, dance.

909
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:42,770
That's it.

910
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,460
They're all looking at you.

911
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:11,430
Believe me, they're
all looking at you.

912
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:22,670
Who is she?

913
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:23,910
I have no idea.

914
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:28,900
Who's that, Mama?

915
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:31,370
I'm not exactly sure, but
this does not bode well.

916
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:32,780
That's a lovely
dress she's got on.

917
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:34,780
And how pretty she is.
Concentrate!

918
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:37,280
You must turn the prince's head, you fools!
Now, get out there!

919
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,950
But no one's asked us to dance.

920
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:40,120
- Gentlemen.
- Oh!

921
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,420
May I present my daughters,

922
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:43,420
- Anastasia, Drisella.
<i>- Mademoiselle.</i>

923
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:45,390
Off you go!

924
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:59,370
Smile.

925
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:08,410
Come with me.

926
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:10,110
- Over there.
- Smile.

927
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:16,890
So, you're the prince!

928
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:21,590
Not "the prince," exactly.

929
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:22,730
There are plenty of
princes in the world.

930
01:03:22,730 --> 01:03:23,730
I'm only a prince.

931
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,160
But your name's not really Kit.

932
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:29,330
Certainly it is, and my
father still calls me that,

933
01:03:29,330 --> 01:03:31,770
when he's especially
un-peeved at me.

934
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:34,400
But you're no apprentice.

935
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:35,840
I am. An apprentice monarch.

936
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,070
Still learning my trade.

937
01:03:38,310 --> 01:03:39,840
Oh, gosh!

938
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:41,840
Look, please forgive me.

939
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:43,780
I thought you might treat
me differently if you knew.

940
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:46,250
I mistook you for a good,
honest country girl,

941
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:49,450
and now I see you didn't want
to overawe a plain soldier.

942
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:51,120
Little chance of that.

943
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,590
No more surprises?

944
01:03:54,830 --> 01:03:56,160
No more surprises.

945
01:03:58,330 --> 01:04:00,300
Is that you?

946
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:01,860
I hate myself in paintings.
Don't you?

947
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:04,870
No one's ever painted
my portrait.

948
01:04:04,870 --> 01:04:07,200
No? Well, they should.

949
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:11,970
Who is she?

950
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:13,180
She gave no name, Your Grace.

951
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:14,480
You didn't ask?

952
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:18,710
on account of introducing Princess
Blodwyn of Llanfairpwllgwyngyll...

953
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,550
Shut up, will you?
"Shut up." Absolutely.

954
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:26,760
I don't believe this!

955
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:30,230
No! Not her!

956
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:37,030
Won't they miss you at the ball?

957
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:40,240
Maybe.

958
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:41,870
But let's not go back just yet.

959
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:46,980
What's wrong?

960
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:53,420
When I go back, they will try to pair
me off with a lady of their choosing.

961
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:55,750
I'm expected to marry
for advantage.

962
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:57,720
Oh. Well, whose advantage?

963
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,490
That is a good question.

964
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:04,760
Well, surely you have a
right to your own heart.

965
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:07,200
And I must weigh that
against the king's wishes.

966
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,830
He's a wise ruler and
a loving father.

967
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:14,540
Well, perhaps he'll
change his mind.

968
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:21,780
I fear he hasn't
much time to do so.

969
01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:25,010
Poor Kit.

970
01:05:27,450 --> 01:05:30,050
People are saying
she's a princess.

971
01:05:30,050 --> 01:05:32,450
Our prince seems quite
taken with her.

972
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:34,720
She went straight for him.

973
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:36,960
You have to appreciate
her efficiency.

974
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,530
But surely, if she is a
princess, this may be good.

975
01:05:42,470 --> 01:05:46,100
I've already promised him in
marriage, to the Princess Chelina.

976
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:48,040
But...

977
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:50,770
Oh.

978
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,640
Forgive me, Your Grace.

979
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:55,810
I did not mean to intrude.

980
01:05:55,810 --> 01:05:58,850
No, it's you who have
to forgive me, madam.

981
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:01,680
Your secret is safe with me.

982
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:16,730
I've never shown this
place to anyone.

983
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:24,810
A secret garden.

984
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:29,750
I love it!

985
01:06:37,350 --> 01:06:38,190
Please.

986
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:40,660
No, I shouldn't.

987
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:41,990
You should.

988
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:44,360
I shouldn't. You should.

989
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,590
I will.

990
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:56,510
May I?

991
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:57,740
Please.

992
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:14,290
Oh!

993
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:26,640
It's made of glass.

994
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:28,800
And why not?

995
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:30,570
Allow me.

996
01:07:30,570 --> 01:07:32,270
Thank you.

997
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:44,820
There.

998
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,660
There.

999
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:54,730
Won't you tell me
who you really are?

1000
01:07:54,730 --> 01:07:58,070
If I do, I think everything
might be different.

1001
01:07:58,070 --> 01:08:00,740
I don't understand. Can you
at least tell me your name?

1002
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,240
My name is...

1003
01:08:08,450 --> 01:08:10,510
I have to leave.

1004
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:12,750
It's hard to explain.

1005
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:15,750
Lizards and pumpkins,
and things.

1006
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:19,860
Wait!

1007
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:23,560
Where are you going?

1008
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:25,890
You've been awfully nice.

1009
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:27,700
Thank you for a wonderful evening.
I've loved it.

1010
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:28,800
Every second!

1011
01:08:37,970 --> 01:08:40,440
"Lizards and pumpkins."

1012
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:01,630
Excuse me.

1013
01:09:01,630 --> 01:09:03,400
Sorry! Terribly sorry.

1014
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:05,030
My goodness!

1015
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:09,140
My prince!

1016
01:09:10,670 --> 01:09:13,340
You've got the wrong one!

1017
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:15,610
He needs her name!

1018
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:16,850
I know he needs her name.

1019
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:18,580
Her name, you ninny.
Get her name!

1020
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:20,180
Ooh, that really hurt!

1021
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:22,420
Oh, Your Majesty.

1022
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:23,620
Young lady.

1023
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:24,850
I am so sorry.

1024
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:26,420
Oh, think nothing
of it, my dear.

1025
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:31,030
I wanted to say, Your Majesty,

1026
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:33,460
your son Kit is the most
lovely person I ever met.

1027
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:35,860
So good and brave.

1028
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:37,930
I hope you know how
much he loves you.

1029
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:40,370
Excuse me!

1030
01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:54,250
Mmm.

1031
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:01,120
Wait!

1032
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:08,000
Wait!

1033
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,570
Where are you going?

1034
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:10,270
Hurry, hurry!

1035
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:11,800
Eh? Ah!

1036
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:14,570
Come back!

1037
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:17,870
Hurry!

1038
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:22,210
Hurry, please, Mr. Goose!

1039
01:10:24,410 --> 01:10:25,550
Wait!

1040
01:10:29,490 --> 01:10:31,320
Watch out!

1041
01:10:37,190 --> 01:10:38,530
Captain, my horse.

1042
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:40,030
No!

1043
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:42,730
This may be some intrigue to
lure you from the palace.

1044
01:10:42,730 --> 01:10:44,400
Your father needs you here.

1045
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,100
Captain!

1046
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:48,700
I was having a fine old time.

1047
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:50,840
You had to go and choose
that one, didn't you?

1048
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:54,240
Yes, I did.

1049
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:21,800
Hurry, Mr. Goose!

1050
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:23,040
Come on!

1051
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:27,040
Hee-ya!

1052
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,480
Be careful, Mr. Goose!

1053
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:29,650
Oh!

1054
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:34,050
Oh, my goodness!

1055
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:45,660
You there! Stop in the
name of the king!

1056
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:48,900
Such bad timing.

1057
01:11:53,170 --> 01:11:54,240
Halt there!

1058
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:55,240
I know what to do!

1059
01:11:55,670 --> 01:11:56,740
Yes!

1060
01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:57,970
Oh, yes!

1061
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:00,240
Get this thing open!

1062
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:06,750
Oh, dear!

1063
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:07,650
Ah!

1064
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:18,530
No, no, no.

1065
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:33,740
Oh, I'm sorry.

1066
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:37,510
You'll find it's
very comfortable.

1067
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:46,110
Oh...

1068
01:14:03,130 --> 01:14:04,700
Do shut up!

1069
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:11,270
Cinderella! We'll
have to wake her up.

1070
01:14:12,410 --> 01:14:13,940
Cinderella!

1071
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:15,980
Wake up, lazy bones!

1072
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:17,980
Tea and a plate of biscuits.

1073
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:19,480
Welcome back!

1074
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:21,780
- You look cheerful!
- And wet!

1075
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:23,920
Oh, uh, I took a walk in the
rain to cheer myself up.

1076
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:24,990
Typical.

1077
01:14:24,990 --> 01:14:26,760
Tea.

1078
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,820
We did not communicate
through mere words.

1079
01:14:28,830 --> 01:14:30,330
Our souls met.

1080
01:14:30,330 --> 01:14:33,090
Precisely. My soul and
the prince's soul.

1081
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:34,460
Your soul was over by
the banquet tables.

1082
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,130
You didn't see him
dance with me.

1083
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:37,330
Dance with you?

1084
01:14:37,330 --> 01:14:39,840
He didn't even speak to you.

1085
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,170
It was not our fault, Mother.
It was that girl.

1086
01:14:42,170 --> 01:14:43,840
The mystery princess.

1087
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,310
Mystery princess?

1088
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:47,940
My, what a charming notion.

1089
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:49,680
Oh, she was no princess.

1090
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:51,910
She was a preening interloper who
made a spectacle of herself.

1091
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,080
Oh?

1092
01:14:54,350 --> 01:14:56,350
A vulgar, young hussy
marched into the ball,

1093
01:14:56,350 --> 01:14:58,920
unaccompanied, if you will,

1094
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:01,460
and to the horror of everyone,
threw herself at the prince.

1095
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:03,430
And he actually danced
with the ugly thing.

1096
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:04,690
- Yes?
- Yes.

1097
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:09,200
He was too polite to send her packing
in front of everyone, you see.

1098
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:12,930
But not wanting to expose us to the
presumptuous wench any further,

1099
01:15:12,940 --> 01:15:14,470
- he took her apart.
- And told her off.

1100
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:16,200
But she refused to leave

1101
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:19,670
and the palace guards
chased her from the party!

1102
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:21,880
I pity the prince.
Such bad taste.

1103
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:23,450
They belong with each other.

1104
01:15:23,450 --> 01:15:25,050
Well, it's no matter, girls.

1105
01:15:25,050 --> 01:15:27,680
The ball was a mere diversion.

1106
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:29,120
The prince is not free
to marry for love.

1107
01:15:30,350 --> 01:15:33,290
He's promised to the Princess
Chelina of Zaragosa.

1108
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:36,290
The Grand Duke told me himself.

1109
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:38,130
It's so very unfair.

1110
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,660
Yes.

1111
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:42,760
The way of the world.

1112
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,700
Oh, hello again.

1113
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:02,450
Thank you for your help.

1114
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:04,920
It really was like a dream.

1115
01:16:05,690 --> 01:16:07,490
Better than a dream.

1116
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:25,870
<i>Ella couldn't wait</i>
<i>to write down</i>

1117
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:28,110
<i>all that had happened,</i>

1118
01:16:28,110 --> 01:16:31,850
<i>so that she might remember</i>
<i>every single bit of it</i>

1119
01:16:31,850 --> 01:16:34,450
<i>just as if she were telling</i>
<i>her mother and father</i>

1120
01:16:34,450 --> 01:16:38,320
<i>about the palace ball and
her time with the prince.</i>

1121
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,490
<i>Above all, the prince.</i>

1122
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,550
Oh, you've come.

1123
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:12,390
Good.

1124
01:17:14,290 --> 01:17:15,690
Oh, Father.

1125
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:17,960
Don't go.

1126
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:20,560
I must.

1127
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,670
You needn't be alone.

1128
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:26,800
Take a bride.

1129
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,740
The Princess Chelina.

1130
01:17:29,670 --> 01:17:32,540
What if I commanded
you to do so?

1131
01:17:34,510 --> 01:17:37,550
I love and respect
you, but I will not.

1132
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:44,290
I believe that we need not
look outside of our borders

1133
01:17:44,290 --> 01:17:46,320
for strength or guidance.

1134
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:50,290
What we need is right before us.

1135
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:55,330
And we need only have courage
and be kind to see it.

1136
01:17:58,700 --> 01:17:59,900
Just so.

1137
01:18:02,710 --> 01:18:04,910
You've become your own man.

1138
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:06,610
Good.

1139
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:12,450
And perhaps, in the
little time left to me,

1140
01:18:12,450 --> 01:18:14,880
I can become the
father you deserve.

1141
01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:21,590
You must not marry
for advantage.

1142
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:26,460
You must marry for love.

1143
01:18:30,730 --> 01:18:32,530
Find that girl.

1144
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:35,070
Find her.

1145
01:18:35,070 --> 01:18:37,540
The one they're all
talking about.

1146
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:38,970
The forgetful one

1147
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:41,310
who loses her shoes..
..loses her shoes.

1148
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:49,480
Oh, be cheerful, boy.

1149
01:18:52,150 --> 01:18:54,090
Thank you, Father.

1150
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:56,660
Thank you, Kit.

1151
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,500
I love you, son.

1152
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:06,940
I love you, Father.

1153
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,440
<i>Once the time for
mourning had passed,</i>

1154
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,970
<i>a proclamation was sent out.</i>

1155
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:49,640
Hear ye! Hear ye!

1156
01:19:49,650 --> 01:19:52,480
Hear ye!

1157
01:19:57,490 --> 01:19:59,990
Know that our new king

1158
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:03,390
hereby declares his love for...

1159
01:20:05,730 --> 01:20:08,400
the mysterious princess...

1160
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:14,170
as wore... glass
slippers to the ball.

1161
01:20:14,170 --> 01:20:19,340
And requests that she present
herself at the palace,

1162
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:23,140
whereupon, if she be willing,

1163
01:20:24,150 --> 01:20:29,150
he will forthwith marry her...

1164
01:20:30,190 --> 01:20:33,690
...with all due ceremony.

1165
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:11,790
Are you looking for this?

1166
01:21:13,230 --> 01:21:16,000
There must be quite a
story to go with it.

1167
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,200
Won't you tell me?

1168
01:21:17,730 --> 01:21:18,800
No?

1169
01:21:19,570 --> 01:21:21,300
All right then.

1170
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:23,540
I shall tell you a story.

1171
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:26,670
Once upon a time,

1172
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:29,580
there was a beautiful young girl

1173
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:32,080
who married for love.

1174
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:35,150
And she had two
loving daughters.

1175
01:21:35,150 --> 01:21:40,990
All was well... but,
one day, her husband,

1176
01:21:40,990 --> 01:21:43,560
the light of her life, died.

1177
01:21:44,330 --> 01:21:46,160
The next time,

1178
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:49,330
she married for the
sake of her daughters.

1179
01:21:49,330 --> 01:21:53,500
But that man, too,
was taken from her.

1180
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:58,270
And she was doomed to look every
day upon his beloved child.

1181
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:02,280
She had hoped to marry off

1182
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:07,080
one of her beautiful, stupid
daughters to the prince.

1183
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:10,590
But his head was turned by a
girl with glass slippers.

1184
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:16,690
And so... I lived
unhappily ever after.

1185
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,660
My story would
appear to be ended.

1186
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:25,030
Now, tell me yours.

1187
01:22:25,870 --> 01:22:27,140
Did you steal it?

1188
01:22:28,270 --> 01:22:29,140
No.

1189
01:22:29,970 --> 01:22:31,270
It was given to me.

1190
01:22:31,270 --> 01:22:32,470
Given to you?

1191
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,640
Given to you. Nothing
is ever given.

1192
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:36,480
For everything, we
must pay and pay.

1193
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:37,810
That's not true.

1194
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:42,220
Kindness is free. Love is free.

1195
01:22:42,220 --> 01:22:44,950
Love is not free.

1196
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:48,760
Now, here is how
you will pay me,

1197
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:52,560
if you are to have
what you desire.

1198
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:56,930
No one will believe you, a dirty
servant girl without a family,

1199
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:59,500
if you lay claim to
the prince's heart.

1200
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:01,970
But with a respectable
gentlewoman to put you forward,

1201
01:23:01,970 --> 01:23:03,300
you will not be ignored.

1202
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:05,570
When you are married,

1203
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:09,440
you will make me the head
of the royal household.

1204
01:23:09,450 --> 01:23:12,510
Anastasia and Drisella we will
pair off with wealthy lords.

1205
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:15,320
And I shall manage that boy.

1206
01:23:15,950 --> 01:23:17,750
But he's not a boy.

1207
01:23:18,650 --> 01:23:20,620
And who are you?

1208
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:22,820
How would you rule a kingdom?

1209
01:23:22,830 --> 01:23:25,030
Best to leave it to me.

1210
01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:27,200
That way we all
get what we want.

1211
01:23:28,530 --> 01:23:29,660
No.

1212
01:23:33,670 --> 01:23:35,000
No?

1213
01:23:36,210 --> 01:23:38,270
I was not able to protect
my father from you,

1214
01:23:38,270 --> 01:23:40,340
but I will protect the
prince and the kingdom...

1215
01:23:41,540 --> 01:23:43,480
no matter what becomes of me.

1216
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:46,680
Well, that is a mistake.

1217
01:23:47,950 --> 01:23:49,280
No!

1218
01:23:49,290 --> 01:23:50,350
Why?

1219
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:54,220
Why are you so cruel?

1220
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:57,060
I don't understand it.

1221
01:23:57,060 --> 01:23:59,360
I've tried to be kind to you.

1222
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,700
You? Kind to me?

1223
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:02,300
Yes.

1224
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:04,570
And though no one
deserves to be treated

1225
01:24:04,570 --> 01:24:06,100
as you have treated me.

1226
01:24:06,970 --> 01:24:08,300
Why do you do it?

1227
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:13,310
Why?

1228
01:24:13,310 --> 01:24:18,210
Because you are young,
and innocent, and good.

1229
01:24:18,210 --> 01:24:19,710
And I...

1230
01:24:24,490 --> 01:24:26,820
No!

1231
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:34,360
May I ask where you got this?

1232
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:36,660
From a ragged servant
girl in my household.

1233
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:40,840
The mystery princess
is a commoner.

1234
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:46,010
You could imagine when I discovered
her subterfuge how horrified I was.

1235
01:24:47,110 --> 01:24:48,780
You told no one else?

1236
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:52,110
Not even my own daughters.

1237
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:55,250
No one need ever know the truth.

1238
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:59,520
You've spared the kingdom a
great deal of embarrassment.

1239
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,620
And I should like to
keep it that way.

1240
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:04,090
Are you threatening me?

1241
01:25:04,630 --> 01:25:05,860
Yes.

1242
01:25:12,970 --> 01:25:14,270
So what do you want?

1243
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:18,440
I should like to be a countess.

1244
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:21,980
And I require advantageous
marriages for my two daughters.

1245
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:24,280
Done.

1246
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:28,480
And the girl?

1247
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:29,780
Oh.

1248
01:25:29,790 --> 01:25:31,890
Do with her what you will.

1249
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:34,220
She's nothing to me.

1250
01:25:36,430 --> 01:25:38,660
Where? Abandoned on
the side of the road.

1251
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:39,890
And have you found her?
The girl?

1252
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:41,900
No, she's disappeared.

1253
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:44,170
There must be some
reason she vanished.

1254
01:25:44,170 --> 01:25:45,830
Perhaps she has been
prevented from speaking.

1255
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,000
Do not lose heart, Kit.

1256
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,300
On the contrary, lose
heart and gain wisdom.

1257
01:25:50,310 --> 01:25:53,440
The people need to know
that the kingdom is secure.

1258
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:57,110
That the king has a queen, and
the land may have an heir.

1259
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:58,850
They want to face the
future with certainty!

1260
01:25:58,850 --> 01:26:00,820
Agreed! Then let us be certain.

1261
01:26:00,820 --> 01:26:02,680
I am king.

1262
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:05,350
I say we shall seek out
the mystery princess,

1263
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,090
even if she does not
want to be found.

1264
01:26:07,090 --> 01:26:08,920
I have to see her again.

1265
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:11,360
But if she's not found...

1266
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:14,930
then for the good of the kingdom, you
must marry the Princess Chelina.

1267
01:26:16,030 --> 01:26:17,100
For the good of the kingdom.

1268
01:26:29,550 --> 01:26:31,350
Very well, agreed.

1269
01:26:31,350 --> 01:26:32,510
But Your Highness...

1270
01:26:38,290 --> 01:26:40,190
But you will spare no effort.

1271
01:26:40,190 --> 01:26:41,890
Your Majesty, of course.

1272
01:26:41,890 --> 01:26:42,960
You have my word.

1273
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:04,310
Next.

1274
01:27:10,190 --> 01:27:12,590
<i>The slipper traveled the length
and breadth of the kingdom,</i>

1275
01:27:14,390 --> 01:27:16,320
<i>visiting every maiden</i>
<i>both high and low,</i>

1276
01:27:16,330 --> 01:27:18,390
<i>and every sort in between.</i>

1277
01:27:18,860 --> 01:27:20,330
Oh, Lord!

1278
01:27:20,330 --> 01:27:21,500
You first, madam.

1279
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:24,200
Well, I'll give it a go.

1280
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:26,270
Right. I say. Where
do you want me?

1281
01:27:26,770 --> 01:27:28,040
Oh!

1282
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:30,370
Up! Up I go.

1283
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:32,170
Oh, careful, my
foot's a bit swollen.

1284
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:33,040
I've been...

1285
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:38,580
It's the yeast.

1286
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:41,080
<i>The Grand Duke was
true to his word.</i>

1287
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:44,590
<i>He spared no effort to</i>
<i>demonstrate to the prince</i>

1288
01:27:44,590 --> 01:27:47,620
<i>that the mystery princess</i>
<i>was not to be found.</i>

1289
01:27:47,620 --> 01:27:48,920
It fits!

1290
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:50,960
It doesn't fit you. It does fit!

1291
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:52,190
- It doesn't fit.
- It's mine!

1292
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,430
I am the mystery princess!
Give back the shoe.

1293
01:27:54,430 --> 01:27:55,630
Take the shoe away from her!

1294
01:27:55,630 --> 01:27:56,800
Don't take the shoe away
from me, please, please!

1295
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:57,930
Please, it's my shoe!

1296
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:00,330
Make way for the slipper!

1297
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:11,050
Can I try the other foot?

1298
01:28:11,050 --> 01:28:12,210
I don't think so.

1299
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:16,120
<i>But whatever they tried,</i>

1300
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:19,550
<i>the magical slipper refused to fit
even the most eligible of maidens.</i>

1301
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:22,060
We found the mystery
princess for ya!

1302
01:28:32,470 --> 01:28:34,040
What's wrong, Captain?

1303
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:37,340
We haven't found the girl.

1304
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:39,170
I'm disappointed for our king.

1305
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:41,440
Oh, come on, now!
Don't lose heart.

1306
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:43,780
There's one more house.

1307
01:28:43,780 --> 01:28:46,080
We must leave no stone unturned.

1308
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:49,120
Horses! Horses!

1309
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:51,950
Mother, it's our chance!

1310
01:28:55,420 --> 01:28:57,190
Let them in!

1311
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:13,210
Gentlemen! What a
wonderful surprise.

1312
01:29:13,210 --> 01:29:15,040
A moment of your
time, good lady.

1313
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:16,840
Of course, Your Grace.

1314
01:29:16,850 --> 01:29:18,680
Please. This way.

1315
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:23,050
<i>Ella did not</i> <i> know
who was downstairs.</i>

1316
01:29:23,050 --> 01:29:25,490
<i>Nor did she care.</i>

1317
01:29:25,490 --> 01:29:27,220
<i>For surely no one</i>
<i>had come to see her.</i>

1318
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:28,390
Jacqueline, stop it!

1319
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:37,730
It shrunk.

1320
01:29:37,730 --> 01:29:39,130
Try again.

1321
01:29:48,010 --> 01:29:49,310
Oh, enough!

1322
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:54,480
<i>Though Ella was sad,</i>

1323
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:55,920
<i>her spirit was not broken.</i>

1324
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:58,050
<i>She knew that the ball,</i>

1325
01:29:58,050 --> 01:29:59,920
<i>and her time</i>
<i>with the prince,</i>

1326
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:02,360
<i>would become beautiful,</i>
<i>distant memories,</i>

1327
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:04,760
<i>like those of her</i>
<i>father and mother,</i>

1328
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:06,630
<i>and her golden childhood.</i>

1329
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:18,340
It fits me!

1330
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:21,380
Bad luck, miss.

1331
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:35,860
<i>Very well.</i>

1332
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:37,890
Our task is done, Captain.

1333
01:30:37,890 --> 01:30:41,330
But fate may yet be
kind to us, girls.

1334
01:30:43,730 --> 01:30:45,300
Indeed, madam!

1335
01:31:14,130 --> 01:31:15,560
Do you hear that, Your Grace?

1336
01:31:16,830 --> 01:31:17,970
Let's be off, Captain.

1337
01:31:17,970 --> 01:31:19,070
Just a moment.

1338
01:31:22,670 --> 01:31:24,100
Madam,

1339
01:31:24,110 --> 01:31:26,740
there is no other
maiden in your house?

1340
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:30,410
None.

1341
01:31:31,850 --> 01:31:33,580
Then has your cat
learned to sing?

1342
01:31:41,190 --> 01:31:44,190
There's been enough play-acting
today, Captain. Let's be off.

1343
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:46,490
But she's lying, Your Grace.

1344
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:48,830
Nonsense! I trust the lady.
We're leaving.

1345
01:31:48,830 --> 01:31:49,760
Grand Duke!

1346
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:57,970
Your Majesty.

1347
01:31:57,970 --> 01:32:00,710
What sweet singing. Makes me
want to tarry just a little.

1348
01:32:01,710 --> 01:32:03,640
Your Majesty, I did not know...

1349
01:32:03,650 --> 01:32:05,710
Captain, would you be so
kind as to investigate?

1350
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:08,880
It would be my pleasure,
Your Majesty.

1351
01:32:17,190 --> 01:32:19,690
There! You see?

1352
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:21,860
I told you it was no
one of any importance.

1353
01:32:21,860 --> 01:32:23,360
We'll see about that.

1354
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:26,400
Miss.

1355
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:33,210
You are requested and required to
present yourself to your king.

1356
01:32:33,210 --> 01:32:35,410
I forbid you to do this!

1357
01:32:35,410 --> 01:32:37,380
And I forbid you to forbid her!

1358
01:32:38,510 --> 01:32:39,880
Who are you to stop an
officer of the king?

1359
01:32:40,750 --> 01:32:42,150
Are you an empress?

1360
01:32:42,850 --> 01:32:43,650
A saint?

1361
01:32:44,250 --> 01:32:45,620
A deity?

1362
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:47,660
I am her mother.

1363
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:55,230
You have never been...

1364
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:59,400
and you never will be my mother.

1365
01:33:03,770 --> 01:33:05,270
Come now, miss.

1366
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:13,180
Just remember who you
are, you wretch!

1367
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:29,530
<i>Would who she was,</i>

1368
01:33:29,530 --> 01:33:32,470
<i>who she really was, be enough?</i>

1369
01:33:32,470 --> 01:33:35,540
<i>There was no magic</i>
<i>to help her this time.</i>

1370
01:33:35,540 --> 01:33:39,040
<i>This is perhaps the greatest
risk that any of us will take.</i>

1371
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:42,340
<i>To be seen as we truly are.</i>

1372
01:33:43,780 --> 01:33:47,380
<i>Have courage, and be kind.</i>

1373
01:34:27,790 --> 01:34:29,020
Who are you?

1374
01:34:31,090 --> 01:34:32,760
I am Cinderella.

1375
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:37,400
Your Majesty...

1376
01:34:39,830 --> 01:34:41,440
I'm no princess.

1377
01:34:43,100 --> 01:34:44,740
I have no carriage,

1378
01:34:45,970 --> 01:34:47,440
no parents,

1379
01:34:48,380 --> 01:34:50,010
and no dowry.

1380
01:34:51,780 --> 01:34:54,380
I do not even know if that
beautiful slipper will fit.

1381
01:34:54,380 --> 01:34:55,780
But...

1382
01:34:57,990 --> 01:34:59,390
if it does...

1383
01:35:01,290 --> 01:35:03,560
will you take me as I am?

1384
01:35:05,390 --> 01:35:07,900
An honest country
girl who loves you.

1385
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:09,700
Of course I will.

1386
01:35:11,230 --> 01:35:14,500
But only if you will
take me as I am.

1387
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:16,300
An apprentice still
learning his trade.

1388
01:35:18,570 --> 01:35:19,470
Please.

1389
01:36:05,350 --> 01:36:06,620
Cinderella!

1390
01:36:06,620 --> 01:36:07,690
Ella!

1391
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:12,290
My dear sister! I'm sorry.

1392
01:36:12,290 --> 01:36:13,930
So very sorry.

1393
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:31,710
Shall we?

1394
01:37:12,620 --> 01:37:13,920
I forgive you.

1395
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:25,000
<i>Forgiven or not,</i>

1396
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:28,040
<i>Cinderella's stepmother</i>
<i>and her daughters</i>

1397
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:30,170
<i>would soon leave</i>
<i>with the Grand Duke,</i>

1398
01:37:30,170 --> 01:37:32,870
<i>and never set foot</i>
<i>in the kingdom again.</i>

1399
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:43,720
They would have
loved each other.

1400
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:46,190
We must have a portrait
of you painted.

1401
01:37:46,190 --> 01:37:48,820
Oh, no. I do hate
myself in paintings.

1402
01:37:48,820 --> 01:37:51,230
Be kind.

1403
01:37:51,230 --> 01:37:53,030
And have courage.

1404
01:37:53,030 --> 01:37:54,600
And all will be well.

1405
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:03,740
Are you ready?

1406
01:38:03,740 --> 01:38:06,070
For anything, so long
as it's with you.

1407
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:18,750
My queen.

1408
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:20,550
My Kit.

1409
01:38:33,030 --> 01:38:36,770
<i>And so Kit</i> <i> and
Ella were married,</i>

1410
01:38:36,770 --> 01:38:39,610
<i>and I can tell you,</i>
<i>as her fairy godmother,</i>

1411
01:38:39,610 --> 01:38:41,240
<i>that they were counted to be</i>

1412
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:46,450
<i>the fairest and kindest
rulers the kingdom had known.</i>

1413
01:38:46,450 --> 01:38:50,580
<i>And Ella continued to see</i>
<i>the world not as it is,</i>

1414
01:38:50,590 --> 01:38:52,950
<i>but as it could be,</i>

1415
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:55,960
<i>if only you believe</i>
<i>in courage...</i>

1416
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:59,130
<i>and kindness</i> <i> and
occasionally...</i>

1417
01:38:59,130 --> 01:39:02,960
<i>just a little bit of magic.</i>

1418
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:20,950
<i>- Well done, Ella.</i>
<i>- My turn?</i>

1419
01:45:13,270 --> 01:45:14,400
<i>Hmm, where did everyone go?</i>
