as "No longer Gage."

00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,280
- I found him.
- [DUSTIN] Where?

685
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,743
In the bathroom by Mr. Salerno's.

686
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:05,869
[MIKE] Copy that.

687
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,497
It's okay.

688
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,750
I'm not gonna hurt you.

689
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:14,628
[SCREECHES]

690
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:37,067
[MONSTER GROWLING]

691
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:04,052
Hey, buddy.

692
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:08,724
- Come here. You know I won't hurt you.
- [CHITTERING]

693
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:11,935
It's okay. It's just me.

694
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:14,062
You're okay.

695
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:16,315
- [MIKE] Let's go. Down here.
- [LUCAS] We're coming!

696
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,820
Stay low. Keep quiet.

697
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,324
Where's Dart?

698
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:27,201
- I don't know. Not here.
- What?

699
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:30,704
- [MAX] He said by Salerno's, right?
- [DUSTIN] Yeah, maybe Will has him.

700
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:33,499
Where is Will?

701
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:43,717
Only this time, I didn't run.

702
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,726
This time, I stood my ground.

703
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,438

[SCREECHING]

705
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:08,408
I said, "Go away. Go away!"

706
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,286
Go away!

707
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,501
Go away!

708
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,587
Go away!

709
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:24,633
Go away! Go away!

710
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:27,845
- Go away!
- [SCREECHING]

711
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,272
Easy-peasy, right?

712
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:41,942
Easy-peasy.

713
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,862
Just like that.
