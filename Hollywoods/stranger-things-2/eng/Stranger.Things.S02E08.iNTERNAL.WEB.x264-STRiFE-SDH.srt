We can't stop those Demo-dogs on our own.

357
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:38,703
Demo-dogs?

358
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:42,707
Demogorgon dogs.

359
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,168
Demo-dogs.

360
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,544
It's like a compound.

361
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,380
It's like a play on words...

362
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:49,463
Okay.

363
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:54,761
- I mean, when it was just Dart, maybe...
- But there's an army now.

364
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,763
- [DUSTIN] Precisely.
- His army.

365
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:58,555
What do you mean?

366
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,058
His army.

367
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:04,062
Maybe if we stop him,
we can stop his army, too.

368
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,379
- [DUSTIN] The shadow monster.
- It got Will that day on the field.

369
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,483
The doctor said it was like a virus,
it infected him.

370
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,324
And so this virus,
it's connecting him to the tunnels?

371
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,511
To the tunnels, monsters,
the Upside Down, everything.

372
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,412
Whoa. Slow down. Slow down.

373
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,622
Okay, so,
the shadow monster's inside everything.

374
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,542
And if the vines feel something like pain,
then so does Will.

375
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,086
- And so does Dart.
- Yeah. Like what Mr. Clarke taught us.

376
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,838
- The hive mind.
- Hive mind?

377
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,257
A collective consciousness.
It's a super-organism.

378
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,093
And this is the thing that
controls everything. It's the brain.

379
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,803
Like the mind flayer.

380
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,765
- [MAX] The what?
- What?

381
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:43,977
The mind flayer.

382
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,270
What the hell is that?

383
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:46,993
It's a monster from an unknown dimension.

384
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,691
It's so ancient
that it doesn't even know its true home.

385
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,985
Okay, it enslaves races
of other dimensions

386
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,946
by taking over their brains using
its highly-developed psionic powers.

387
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,033
Oh, my God, none of this is real.
This is a kids' game.

388
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,535
No, it's a manual. And it's not for kids.

389
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:02,954
And unless you know something
that we don't,

390
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,331
this is the best metaphor...

391
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,498
Analogy.

392
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,792
Analogy? That's what you're worried about?

393
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:11,129
Fine. An analogy for understanding
whatever the hell this is.

394
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:13,256
Okay, so this mind flamer thing...

395
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,966
- Flayer. Mind flayer.
- [SIGHS]

396
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,134
What does it want?

397
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,594
To conquer us, basically.

398
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,429
It believes it's the master race.

399
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:20,847
[STAMMERS] Like the Germans?

400
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,682
Uh, the Nazis?

401
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,186
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Nazis.
- Uh...

402
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,646
If the Nazis were
from another dimension, totally.

403
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:33,943
Uh, it views other races, like us,
as inferior to itself.

404
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,904
It wants to spread,
take over other dimensions.

405
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:39,240
We are talking about the destruction
of our world as we know it.

406
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,868
That's great. That's great.
That's really great. Jesus!

407
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:47,832
Okay, so if this thing is like a brain
that's controlling everything,

408
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,626
then if we kill it...

409
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,336
We kill everything it controls.

410
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,505
- We win.
- Theoretically.

411
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:56,548
Great. So how do you kill this thing?
Shoot it with Fireballs or something?

412
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,426
[CHUCKLES] No. No, no Fire... No Fireballs.

413
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,805
Uh, you summon an undead army,
uh, because...

414
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:05,058
[STAMMERING] ...because zombies,
you know, they don't have brains,

415
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:08,770
and the mind flayer, it... it...
It likes brains.

416
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,457
- It's just a game. It's a game.
- What the hell are we doing here?

417
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:14,109
I thought we were waiting
for your military backup.

418
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,402
We are!

419
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,861
How are they gonna stop this?

420
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,385
You can't just shoot this with guns.

421
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,490
You don't know that!
We don't know anything!

422
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,742
We know it's already killed
everybody in that lab.

423
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,536
We know the monsters are gonna molt again.

424
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:28,039
We know that it's only a matter of time
before those tunnels reach this town.

425
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,999
[JOYCE] They're right.

426
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,253
We have to kill it.

427
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:36,923
I want to kill it.

428
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:37,841
- Me, too.
- I...

429
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,384
Me, too, Joyce, okay?

430
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,552
But how do we do that?

431
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,929
We don't exactly know
what we're dealing with here.

432
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,931
[MIKE] No. But he does.

433
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,728
If anyone knows
how to destroy this thing, it's Will.

434
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,564
He's connected to it.
He'll know its weakness.

435
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,566
[MAX] I thought
we couldn't trust him anymore.

436
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:58,153
That he's a spy for the mind flayer now.

437
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:02,031
Yeah, but he can't spy
if he doesn't know where he is.

438
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:08,872
Yeah, this'll work.

439
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,417
[GRUNTING]

440
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,604
Hey.

441
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:37,776
What you did, um, helping the kids...

442
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:42,655
that was... really cool.

443
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,239
Yeah.

444
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,827
Those little shits are real trouble,
you know?

445
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,371
Believe me, I know.

446
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,262
[DUSTIN] Hey.

447
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:09,015
I'm... I'm sorry about Dart and all.

448
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:13,228
I guess I just thought
that he was my friend.

449
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,355
I was wrong.

450
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,316
I broke the rule of law,

451
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:23,196
so if you want your girlfriend to take
over my spot in the party, I understand.

452
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,323
She's not my girlfriend.

453
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,617
I saw you two
holding hands in the bus, Lucas.

454
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,536
She was just scared.

455
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,329
Maybe, but I could feel it.

456
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,622
Feel what?

457
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,375
The electricity.

458
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:45,969
[SIGHS]

459
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,768
I get why El was your mage now.

460
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:55,228
What?

461
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:58,356
Lucas. He told me all about her.

462
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,439
Well, he shouldn't have.

463
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,739
And just because you know the truth,
it doesn't mean you're in our party.

464
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:04,988
You do know that, right?

465
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,281
Yeah, I know.

466
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:12,620
I mean, why would you want a stupid zoomer
in your party anyway?

467
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,291
I'm just saying, El?

468
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,835
She sounds like she was really awesome.

469
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:21,254
Yeah, she was.

470
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,632
Until that thing took her.

471
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,176
Just like it took Bob.

472
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,643
You sure this is gonna work?

473
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,478
He knew who I was.

474
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,272
He's still in there.

475
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,941
It's gonna work.

476
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,484
It has to.

477
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,536
- All right, you ready?
- [JOYCE] Yeah.

478
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,717
[GASPS]

479
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,578
If he finds out where we are...

480
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,832
will he send those dogs after us?

481
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,085
He won't find out.

482
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:29,048
Yeah, but, if he does...

483
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,220
Judgment day.

00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:50,069
[GRUNTS] What? What? What is this?

485
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,324
What? What is this?

486
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,577
Why am I tied up?

00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,247

Where am I?

00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,919
You recognize this?

491
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,921
Do you recognize this?

[JOYCE] Hey.

We wanna help you.

494
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:15,136
But to do that,
we have to understand how to kill it.

00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,721
Why am I tied up?

00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:18,765
Why am I tied up?

00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:21,309
Why am I tied up? Why am I tied up?

498
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,310

00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,604

It's your birthday.

00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,696
Your birthday.

510
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:24,330
When you turned eight,
I gave you that huge box of crayons.

511
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,957
Do you remember that?

512
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,417
It was 120 colors.

513
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:35,216
And all your friends,
they got you Star Wars toys,

514
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:41,013
but all you wanted to do was draw
with all your new colors.

515
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:47,812
And you drew this big spaceship,
but it wasn’t from a movie.

516
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:49,939
[STAMMERS] It was your spaceship.

517
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:52,775
A rainbow ship is what you called it.

518
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:58,489
And you must have used
every color in the box.

519
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:05,121
I took that with me to Melvald's

520
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:11,002
and I put it up
and I told everyone who came in,

521
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:13,337
"My son drew this."

522
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,883
And you were so embarrassed. [CHUCKLES]

523
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:22,054
But I was so proud.

524
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,100
I was so, so proud.

00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,107

We stayed up all night
building Castle Byers...

00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,952
just the way you drew it.
