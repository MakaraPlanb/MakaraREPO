1
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,480
GRADUATION PARTY

2
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,200
FIVE MONTHS EARLIER

3
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,560
But... that can't be true.

4
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,080
All right. Thank you.

5
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,000
He's been released, hasn't he?

6
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,160
- Do I really have to go back?
- Why wouldn't you go back?

7
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,480
Did you do anything wrong?

8
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,200
Then, you <i>should </i>go back...

9
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,640
and with your head held high, okay?

10
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,920
Go on, get dressed.

11
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,760
Why the hell didn't we hear
he was released?

12
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,880
For the same reason we never heard
he was locked up.

13
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,960
One of his moms is very powerful.
She owns newspapers and magazines.

14
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,080
But that won't get him out of jail.

15
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,080
Do you have anything to say?

16
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,680
- Or will you just keep quiet as usual?
- At least she finally talked.

17
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,080
Some people knew
and never said a damn word.

18
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,880
Ander? Holy shit! You knew too?

19
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,600
So, everybody knew but me?

20
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,200
Lu, stay out of it.
This has nothing to do with you.

21
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,480
Correction. I have nothing to do with <i>you.</i>

22
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,760
I just would've liked to have known

23
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,120
that the boy sitting next to me
was a fucking killer.

24
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,680
- Creepy.
- Polo didn't do anything.

25
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,640
And we're supposed to believe you
of all people, right,

26
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,480
Liar Barbie?

27
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,280
Should we remind the class
who you are?

28
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,000
No, that won't be necessary. Thanks.

29
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,280
Um, look, all they have against him
is a statement from a jealous ex.

30
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,920
You really don't get it, do you?

31
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,480
In other words, the whole show you put on
was totally pointless, wasn't it?

32
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,080
- What a bummer, man.
- Like we needed your opinion, lowlife.

33
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,760
- Excuse me?
- Sit down and listen up, please.

34
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,120
Your classmate has been released on bail.

35
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,200
This means there are charges against him,
and he's still being investigated.

36
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,840
I've told his family that,
given the circumstances,

37
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,040
- I cannot allow him to come back.
- So, he won't graduate, right?

38
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,560
Fortunately, it looks like all this
will be resolved soon.

39
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,480
What?

40
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:41,120
The judge has ordered a confrontation
between Polo and his accuser tomorrow

41
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,280
in order to compare their accounts
and decide whether to charge him formally

42
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,800
or to drop the charges.

43
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,280
I know it's hard
to distance yourselves from this,

44
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,640
but I urge you to do it for your own good.

45
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,680
This week, we have representatives

46
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,640
from the world's best universities
coming to meet you.

47
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,040
And with a bit of luck,
you might be accepted to one

48
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,440
or even be awarded a scholarship.

49
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,320
This is a crucial moment.
There's a lot at stake. Stay focused.

50
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,440
Don't let the past ruin your future.

51
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
Good morning.

52
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,560
Merry Christmas, happy New Year,

53
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,760
happy holidays, happy everything,
everyone's happy.

54
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,440
Leave.

55
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,920
- You like it?
- Now.

56
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,720
- What are you doing here?
- Going to some class or another.

57
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,280
- Excuse me.
- Hey!

58
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,760
- Why aren't you in Chile?
- Because I'm a responsible student...

59
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,936
and I'm here to finish the school year.
Imagine that.

60
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,880
Where are you sleeping?
Who are you staying with?

61
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,320
Who needs to sleep here?
Oh, please, babe.

62
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,760
This is not a game, Valerio.

63
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,520
You know what Dad will do to you
when he finds out you're near me.

64
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,880
With a little luck,
he'll buy me another ticket to Chile,

65
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,840
and I'll be able to live comfortably
off it for a long time.

66
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,080
Let me make this clear.

67
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,560
Let's see if you can get this
through that drug-addled head of yours.

68
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,920
Dad'll kill you when he finds out
you're around.

69
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,520
And I don't mean that metaphorically.

70
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,920
Of course.

71
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I understand.

72
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,441
Because, after all, I'm the one
who's guilty of corruption of a minor,

73
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,680
and you're the pure
and virginal victim, right?

74
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,800
Because that's what you told him.

75
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,160
Did you bat your eyes at him
when you said it, too?

76
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,920
Do you know why he believes me?
Because Iam a model daughter.

77
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,360
Good, healthy...

78
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,240
And, above all, a liar.

79
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,440
If you'll excuse me.

80
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,920
- What are you doing?
- What you asked me to do.

81
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,840
Distracting you
when I catch you obsessing.

82
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,640
- Do you need to do that by hitting me?
- Well...

83
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,480
I can think of another way.

84
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,120
Come on.

85
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,760
<i>♪ She want a Rollie, Rollie, bro ♪</i>

86
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,440

89
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,200
- Seriously?
- Come on. Pretend I'm not here.

90
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,520
Look at the TV.

91
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,960
All right.

92
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,560
What game should I play, huh?

93
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,240
A fighting game? With buff guys?

94
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,160
Any, man. What difference does it make?
Just shut up, play, and enjoy yourself.

95
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,920
Hey, what's this you have here?

96
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,080
What do you think, Omar? Huh?

97
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,760
- The usual.
- No, I mean <i>here.</i>

98
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,600

101
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,680

103
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,840

Nothing.

- Yeah, don't worry.

111
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,960
I'm sure it's nothing,
but it's best to have it checked.

112
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,280
Come on, relax.

113
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,960
They haven't found the trophy.
He'll never be convicted without evidence.

114
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,640
Carla will get him convicted.

115
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,040
You don't know what they're like
when they're together.

116
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,040
One look from her,
and Polo will shit his pants.

117
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,416
- He'll end up behind bars, trust me.
- You don't know that.

118
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,920
- He deserves it.
- Right.

119
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,280
Since you're rich,
this will blow your fucking mind,

120
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,520
but people don't always get
what they deserve, Guzmán.

121
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,920
What the hell do you want?

122
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,560
<i>I spent Christmas
in a juvenile detention center.</i>

123
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,880
How about you? Were you skiing in Andorra?
Shopping in Milan?

124
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,480
Yeah, I had a great fucking time
watching my parents' marriage go to shit.

125
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,360
Do you think it was easy for me?

126
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,560
We could go back to the way it was.

127
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,040
- All you need to say is you made it up...
<i>- The way it was?</i>

128
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,160
I used to live in fear of someone
finding out what happened.

129
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,200
I don't want to go back to that.

130
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,720
- Listen to me...
<i>- I'm going to tell the truth,</i>

131
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,680
but I'll give you the chance
to do it first.

132
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,560
<i>If you confess,
you'll get a reduced sentence,</i>

133
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,920
<i>and we'll put an end to this.</i>

134
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,480
What a train wreck, huh?

135
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,520
No comment.

136
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,880
Sure,
because the killer being the classmate

137
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,680
of the victim's boyfriend and her brother

138
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,520
must be something you see every day,
right?

139
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,480
Didn't you hear Azucena?

140
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,480
I'm focusing on my future.

141
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,840
Shit, now I get it.

142
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,640
That's why you were shut away
in your house all break,

143
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,720
ignoring messages, huh?

144
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,440
- You were preparing for those interviews.
- If you want to talk, Samuel's over there.

145
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,640
I'll pass.
The missing person can go to hell.

146
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I don't let anyone play me, Nadia.

147
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,600
- Weren't you crazy about him?
- I got over him.

148
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,400
- Like the flu.
- A tropical flu. Lasted for months.

149
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,840
When I see him now,

150
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,240
all I can think about is how much
the jerk looks like Harry Potter.

151
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,080
Maybe he cast a spell on me.
And now it's as if someone had gone...

152
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,320
And, hey, now when I look at him,
I don't feel anything for him.

153
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,160
- I wish it were that easy.
- Huh?

154
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,600
Nothing.

155
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,960
Just keep trying.

156
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,200
- Carla will listen eventually.
- But why?

157
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,520
Because she still loves you.

158
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,680
Only someone who's madly in love with you
would try to hurt you so badly.

159
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,520
What did you do to make her so resentful?

160
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,720
- Me? Nothing, Mom. I just...
- Still,

161
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,560
I don't think anything justifies
what she's done. I mean...

162
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,400
those are very serious accusations.

163
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,120
Cayetana, isn't it? Or is that a lie, too?

164
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,720
- Begoña!
- Look,

165
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,840
love is an incurable illness.

166
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,240
No pill, therapy,
or surgery can get rid of it.

167
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,000
I could forgive a person in love
for almost anything,

168
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,440
but there's no excuse for what you did.

169
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,800
- Mom.
- It was a scam.

170
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,760
You can't afford to be seen
with someone like her.

171
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,840
No. No. We are together, okay?

172
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,600
She's staying the night.

173
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,040
- That is, if she wants to.
- Yes.

174
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,600
Goodbye. Thank you.

175
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,520
- Peace be upon you.
- And peace be upon you.

176
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,440
Can I see your backpack, please?

177
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,280
Is this an excuse to flirt with me?

178
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,200
Do I look like I'm flirting?

179
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,240
Well, it's working.

180
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,320
Your backpack.

181
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,240
I'm a Muslim, too. I don't steal.

182
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,240
Let's check.

183
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,200
Sure. How come you didn't ask
the woman before me?

184
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,200
- Because she wasn't suspicious.
- Oh.

185
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,160
Just like at the airport, right?

186
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,880
At security checkpoints,
where they only search people like you.

187
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,920
We can search more if you like.

188
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,320
Have a nice day, sister.

189
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,800
Hello.

190
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,280
- Mom, we have to talk.
- A letter came.

191
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,640
Well... not a letter.

192
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,200
Here.

193
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,200
ASILAH

194
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,680
<i>I have a job, a house...</i>

195
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,160
<i>I'm doing fucking great.</i>

196
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,280
You'll be even better
when you're back with us.

197
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,520
- <i>I prefer not to get my hopes up.</i>
- He's locked up, Nano.

198
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,400
The inspector told your brother
that when the bastard confesses,

199
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,120
you'll be able to return.

200
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,200
<i>Did she really say that?</i>

201
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,320
<i>She's that sure?</i>

202
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,720
<i>Is this really going to end well?</i>

203
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,720
Well, of course, honey.

204
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,480
Of course it'll end well.

205
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,160
It's not a lost cause.

206
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,520
- At the hearing tomorrow...
- No, Samuel, no.

207
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,800
Those people always land on their feet.
They have nine lives, like cats.

208
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,240
And if they run out of them,
they can buy more.

209
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,800
That guy will get what he deserves.

210
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,920
Honestly, honey,
it's like you were born yesterday.

211
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,040
I'm sick of this.

212
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,800
Sick of it all.

213
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,200
Your brother had the right idea.

214
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,600
He's somewhere where nobody knows him,
nobody looks down on him.

215
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,400
Where he can start over.

216
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,160
- What if we go with him?
- What?

217
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,520
I'm fed up.
Everything's an uphill battle here.

218
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,720
- I can see that.
- What do we have to lose?

219
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,960
I have a scholarship at the best school
in the country.

220
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You've got to be fucking kidding me,
Samuel.

221
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,120
The same school that's made your life hell
from day one?

222
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,200
Where they see you as a criminal?

223
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,520
Would you really miss anyone there?

224
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,120
How are you, sweetheart?

225
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
"Sweetheart"?

226
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,800
I'm no longer a "fucking lying brat,"
then?

227
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,840
Carla, I'd like to take back what happened
these past two weeks more than anyone,

228
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,960
- but only you can do that.
- Get out before Mom sees you.

229
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,160
Don't do it for me.
Do it for Polo.

230
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,120
You said yourself it was an accident.

231
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,600
He took a life,
but he did it to try to save ours.

232
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,680
Does he deserve 30 years in prison
for that?

233
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,800
How considerate of you,
worrying about my ex.

234
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,240
And I guess
the fact that the police could find out

235
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,760
about your shady business dealings
has nothing to do with it.

236
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,240
I'm worried about your mother.

237
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,680
- She's not involved in this.
- Not yet.

238
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,160
But if you don't retract your statement,
if the investigation continues

239
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,760
and they find me out,

240
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,480
I'll have to give the police
bigger fish to fry.

241
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,440
If I talk and they look into
the winery's financial statements...

242
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,800
- Those are <i>your </i>financial statements.
- It's her signature on them.

243
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,640
...your mother will lose everything.

244
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,800
She'll only have her name,
and it'll be worthless.

245
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,040
Why don't we both keep quiet?

246
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,560
Things could go back to how they were.

247
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,600
Carla, I'm asking you to also do
whatever it takes to save this family.

248
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,400
Nobody is accusing you.

249
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,760
We're going to talk to everyone.

250
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,280
I heard the glass shatter,
and I came running...

251
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,520
but I didn't push him.

252
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,760
It seems nobody pushed him.

253
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,800
According to several witnesses,
the glass was cracked,

254
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,400
he lost his balance, and...

255
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,160
If it was an accident,
what are we doing here?

256
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,120
He lost his balance
because someone stabbed him in the chest.

257
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,200
<i>In the hands of that fucking brat again.</i>

258
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,320
I say we go to court tomorrow
in case she gets any funny ideas.

259
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,560
We'll see if that bastard
has the balls to lie then.

260
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,280
- Can we change the subject?
- No, not today. Today, we talk.

261
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,040
College recruiters
will be coming in two days.

262
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,360
Oxford representatives will be there, too.
Do you remember?

263
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,960
That's where Marina wanted to study.

264
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,360
She acted like such a rebel,
but she bust her ass to go

265
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,840
to one of the most expensive universities
in England.

266
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,840
We used to make fun of her.

267
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,600
That, too, was taken away from her.

268
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,040
Who she was,
but also who she could have been.

269
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,920
That's what I want for the culprit:
for him to be left with nothing.

270
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,080
It's called justice.

271
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,760
It's your word against hers.

272
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,080
What if there's someone else?

273
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
Who?

274
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,320
They can't find Christian.

275
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,040
Ander.

276
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,280
I NEED TO SEE YOU. IT'S REALLY URGENT.

277
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,960
When did you notice it?

278
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,760
Yesterday.

279
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,240
Have you had any of these symptoms lately:

280
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,520
fatigue, dizziness...

281
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,760
...bleeding nose or gums?

282
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,320
Um, I don't know.

283
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,720
Mm-hmm.

284
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,800
- What could it be?
- Hm, anything or nothing.

285
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,320
- Are your parents with you?
- No.

286
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,400
- I'm 18 years old.
- Okay.

287
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,160
When the results arrive,

288
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,840
we'll send you a message
so you can come get them, okay?

289
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,680
We should have them by tomorrow.

290
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,200
ALL COOL. WILL KNOW SOON,
BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK BAD.

I need
a dose of your finest concoction.

295
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,760
Champagne. The usual.

296
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,440
What are you celebrating, Mr. Chile?

297
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,280
That you're here.

298
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,560
So, you don't have a friend in the world,
right?

299
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,320
Do you think someone
with a bottle of champagne can be alone?

300
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,240
Any second now,

301
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,760
I'll have tons of friends here.

302
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,840
Declined.

303
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,880
Well, we can fix that.

304
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,280

and a cloistered nun.

00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,800
Chill.

334
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,960
I was just trying to get over one guy
by getting under another.

335
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,960
But that would have required you
to be a bit harder...

336
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,880
Yeah. How can I make it up to you?

337
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,640
I'd be happy with sleeping
in each other's arms, all romantic.

338
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,560
Or just you fingering me
and getting me off would work.

339
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,080
- Do you have a place we could go?
- No. I'm sleeping in my car.

340
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,880
<i>♪ Oh, oh ♪</i>

341
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,880
Do you like it?
I stole it from a great shop in London.

342
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,120
I'm really sorry.

343
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,560
I know it feels bad to be judged
by the color of your skin

344
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,600
- or based on how you dress.
- No worries.

345
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,800
It was just an excuse
to flirt with me, right?

346
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,000
Oh, another rich kid.

347
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,120
- You all think you're irresistible.
- Weren't you apologizing?

348
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,880
I'd already finished.

349
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,000
- This is your flirting face, then.
- I don't have one.

350
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,240
- What's your name?
- Malick.

351
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,400
- I'm Nadia.
- I know.

352
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,240
<i>Tomorrow, university officials
are coming to talk to you.</i>

353
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,440
They don't have time for all of you,
so please indicate your first choice.

354
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,160
They might interview you.

355
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,440
We'll come around to collect your forms
in just a minute.

356
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,320
Polo,
stop calling me, for fuck's sake.

357
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,680
<i>Why does he want to talk to Ander?</i>

358
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,320
He's scared. If Ander talks...

359
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,120
He could say Polo confessed
and corroborate Carla's story.

360
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,640
- Convince Ander to give a statement.
- Me?

361
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,960
- He's your best friend.
- He's a filthy rat.

362
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,480
I won't beg for his help.

363
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,520
If the hearing doesn't go well,
they'll fucking close the case.

364
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,800
It'll be fine, Samu.

365
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,560
You might've fucked her,
but you don't know Carla like I do.

366
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,320
Speak with Ander already.

367
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,320
Carla! Carla!

368
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,480
- How are you?
- How am I?

369
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,440
Stay away from me!

370
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,320
- I swear I'll hit you right here.
- Listen.

371
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,800
I'm sorry I put you in this position,
but you can't back down now.

372
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,440
Do you realize if I go ahead with this,
I'll lose my family,

373
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,680
the wineries, and everything?

374
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,560
- What the fuck will I have left?
- Me.

375
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,600
You'll have me.

376
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,360
I love you.

377
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,120
Only if I do as you say, right?

378
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,440
You'll toss me aside again
when you're done.

379
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,560
No, if you do what I ask, you'll prove
you're the person I fell in love with.

380
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,200
Look, there's Sleeping Beauty.

381
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,720
- In the car?
- Shh!

382
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,240
Really?

383
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,160
- What?
- What the fuck!

384
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,800
You said I needed to learn how to budget.
Living in the car is much cheaper

385
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,000
- than paying for a hotel room.
- Sure.

386
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,280
That's why you're selling your jewelry.
Where's the ring?

387
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,200
Not yet, at least.

388
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,120
I see you didn't leave out a single detail
when you told her, huh?

389
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,600
Just the limp dick.

390
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,360
Oh, oops!

391
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,040
You need help, bonehead.

392
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,880
You were with her?

393
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,040
You don't waste time,
and your taste is getting worse.

394
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,880
- No offense.
- Hey, that <i>is</i> a bit offensive, sweetheart.

395
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,960
Sorry.

396
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,320
Do you mind?

397
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,200
- Please?
- Sure.

398
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,600
- Thanks for your help.
- No problem.

399
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,280
You're going to sell the car,
buy a ticket to Chile, and fly back.

400
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,600
Let your mom take care
of this divine retribution.

401
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,560
Bad news. She won't pick up the phone.

402
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,960
What happened?

403
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,920
Well, I figured Christmas is a busy time.
I thought she was just at the beach house.

404
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,880
But then I called from a different phone,
and she <i>did </i>answer.

405
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,160
I said, "Merry Christmas."

406
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,320
And she hung up.

407
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,920
I see.

408
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,200
Come and stay at home.

409
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,600
Dad's away for a few days.

410
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,600
And then we'll see what we'll do, okay?

411
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,840
Hey!

412
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,840
Hi.

413
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,240
I have something to say.

414
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,880
If you have any decency left,
you'll tell the judge...

415
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,960
I have to go.

416
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,160
- I'm talking to you, asshole.
- This isn't the time for this.

417
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,480
Well, fuck you, then.

418
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,800
RESULTS AVAILABLE.
PLEASE COME TO THE CLINIC.

419
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,080
Hello. Is it almost time?
How are you doing?

420
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,240
I'm sorry, Mom.

421
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
Darling...

422
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,000
all you did is tell the truth.

423
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,640
And sometimes,
there's a price to pay for that.

424
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,560
We might have lost people along the way...

425
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,320
but whatever happens,
we'll always have each other.

426
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,640
Carla, I'll always be by your side.

427
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,560
Always.

428
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,640
Hmm?

429
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,360
- Ander hates me.
- What are you saying, Polo?

430
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,880
- What if he talks?
- He won't, okay?

431
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,240
Maybe not today.

432
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,120
But what about tomorrow?

433
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,256
Or the day after that? Or next week?
Do I really want to live like this?

434
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,280
Always wondering if today's the day
I'll be caught?

435
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,496
Stop it. Do you hear me? Stop it.

436
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,800
Don't say that again.

437
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,600
Besides, what else can you do,
my love?

438
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,080
I can tell the truth.

439
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,480
Ander Muñoz?

440
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,360
You can come in. I'm Julia.

441
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,720
Good afternoon. Let's begin.

442
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:32,040
Before the court clerk
reads your affidavits,

443
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,320
do you confirm
your versions of the events?

444
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,560
Do you have anything to declare?

445
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,920
Uh...

446
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,040
I...

447
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,320
- Well, I wanted to say...
- I made it all up.

448
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,520
I'm sorry.

449
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,760
I was very angry at my father and my ex.

450
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,480
My father was always very strict with me.

451
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,800
I made this all up to hurt them.

452
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,680
But now I realize I've gone too far...
and I deeply regret it.

453
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,120
I'm sorry for all the pain I've caused.

454
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,600
And I hope you can forgive me.

455
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,720
I told you to speak to Ander.

456
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,800
Shut the hell up. Didn't you speak
with your girlfriend?

457
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,880
If she really loved you,
she wouldn't have stabbed you in the back.

458
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,280
Do you know what you just did?
What were you thinking?

459
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,640
I was thinking about my future.

460
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,120
Let's go home, honey.

461
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,000
We'll talk later, okay?

462
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
<i>I didn't speak to him
at all last night.</i>

463
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,080
<i>We hadn't spoken in a long time.</i>

464
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,920
What did you do just after he fell?

465
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,040
I went down to the dance floor.

466
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,640
That's all.

467
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,440
Were you serious about leaving?

468
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,400
The sooner the better.

469
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,800
Hm?

470
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,880
You heard, right?

471
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,360
What are we going to do?

472
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,680
What do you mean?
We're going to forget about it.

473
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,840
They let him go free. It's over.

474
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,960
- And let him get away with it?
- It's not our business, Omar.

475
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,440
What do you mean?

476
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,880
Of course it's our business.
It's <i>your </i>business.

477
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,360
- Polo confessed to you.
- Omar.

478
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,920
I have enough problems to deal with.
I don't need to take on anyone else's.

479
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,360
What's wrong?

480
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,640
Did you hear from the doctor? Ander...

481
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,720
Yeah, he said it's nothing.
It was just a scare.

482
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,040
You just gave <i>me </i>a scare,
you dick.

483
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,680
Can we just lie on the sofa and not talk,
please?

484
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,160
Okay.

485
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,200
Want to play video games?

486
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,320
- Is it good?
- Mm.

487
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,880
Delicious.

488
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,280
- Mm.
- I'm glad you're home.

489
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,760
Thanks.

490
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,920
Dad will be back in three days.

491
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,120
We've got time to plan what to do. Okay?

492
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,800
He won't listen to me.
He'd listen to you if you told the truth.

493
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,320
I-I can't do that, Valerio.

494
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,760
- Hm?
- Even if I wanted to.

495
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,240
I can't. I just can't.

496
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,440
You said he'd be back in three days.

497
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,760
What's this scumbag doing here?

498
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,880
Holy shit. You idiot.

499
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,000
- What's he... Answer me!
- Dad, chill!

500
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,400
Can we talk about this
in a civilized manner, like...

501
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,040
Norwegians?

502
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:37,880
I appreciate you had the courtesy
to sit at opposite ends of the table.

503
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,280
I only told him to come
because his mom won't talk to him.

504
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,280
I don't care.

505
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,360
He has to stop
taking advantage of my daughter.

506
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,600
I'm your son, too.

507
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,160
You are the degenerate
who took advantage of a minor.

508
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,680
I didn't want to get the police involved,
but enough is enough.

509
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,040
- Dad.
- What you did is a crime, and you'll pay.

510
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,040
First, with a restraining order.
And then, maybe, even with jail time.

511
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,320
Please.

512
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,800
I'm being very civilized
and very <i>Norwegian, </i>Lucrecia.

513
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,160
Anyone else would have killed him
for molesting his daughter.

514
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,720
Valerio didn't molest me.

515
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,480
Okay?

516
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,680
- You're just a child.
- And so is he.

517
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,880
He's got you under his spell.
You don't know what you're saying.

518
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,480
I know perfectly well
what I'm saying, Dad.

519
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,440
Nobody forced me to do anything. Ever.

520
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,480
I fucked Valerio because I needed him.

521
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:40,560
I wanted him
more than anything in the world.

522
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,240
Love is not a crime.

523
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,760
And he's not a criminal.

524
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,200
And I'm not the perfect daughter...

525
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,040
...and the innocent child you think I am.

526
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,080
So you're an adult now.

527
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,120
You didn't want to see it,
and I didn't want you to see it either.

528
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,440
But I am.

529
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,160
Very well.

530
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,240
From now on, you'll live like an adult.

531
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,320
Until you turn 18,

532
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,240
I'm legally obligated to provide you
with food and shelter, but that's it.

533
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,800
Forget about money, luxuries, outfits,

534
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,320
and expensive universities.

535
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,880
- What are you saying?
- You're an adult.

536
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,280
And when you turn 18,
I want you out of this house.

537
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,840
You are already 19, so I don't need
to spell it out for you. Out.

538
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,560
Hi.

539
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,880
How are you?

540
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,880
- I don't know what I'm doing here.
- Right.

541
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,040
Why didn't you answer
my messages yesterday?

542
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,440
Is that seriously
what you're worried about?

543
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,440
Cayetana,
we need to get rid of the trophy,

544
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,840
and all this will be over.

545
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,160
It's safe with me.

546
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,200
- Okay?
- What?

547
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,000
- Listen to me.
- No, no, no, Cayetana. No.

548
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,920
- Polo.
- No.

549
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,760
It's too risky
to try to get rid of it now.

550
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,920
- And it's safe with me.
- What do you mean?

551
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Polo.

552
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,280
Hey, Polo. Look at me. Look at me.

553
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,000
Listen. Don't worry, I'm on your side.

554
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,520
I'm the only one on your side.

555
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Okay?

556
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,040
It's excellent.

557
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,160
Your résumé is impressive, Nadia.

558
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,360
Thank you very much.

559
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,160
But...

560
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,120
- ...I'll be honest with you.
- Mm-hmm?

561
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,560
I don't think
we'll grant you the scholarship.

562
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,800
Why not?

563
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,040
At our university,

564
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,240
we not only look at grades
and hard work...

565
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,920
but also the student's life
<i>outside </i>of the classroom.

566
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,680
Hm, well, I have all sorts of interests.

567
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,280
Uh, I'm very curious.

568
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,560
I work at my parents' shop,
and I'd like to give them a better life.

569
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,720
I'm sure of that.

570
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,600
But we've heard of a video going around.

571
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,480
That's not working in your favor.

572
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,360
We look for model students
for our scholarships.

573
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,360
I'm sorry.

574
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,120
How did it go?

575
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,680
- Uh, would you rather tell me over coffee?
- What?

576
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,040
I'm a good Muslim.

577
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,360
- I'll introduce myself to your parents.
<i>- I'm </i>the one who's not a good Muslim.

578
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,400
Are you the only one who hasn't heard?

579
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,440
"The one who repents from sin
is like one who did not sin."

580
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,160
Muhammad said that.
I wouldn't go against him.

581
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,920
- Do you know about the video?
- I've heard about it.

582
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:31,800
And you still want to get me coffee?
What kind of Muslim are you?

583
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,360
One who lives in this century.

584
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,040
And I didn't say anything
about treating you to a coffee.

585
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,720
- If the girl wants to pay, it's okay.
- Sure, but I thought you were loaded.

586
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,480
My <i>father </i>is loaded.
He's the richest man in Senegal.

587
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,960
But here,
I must be the... third or fourth richest?

588
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,680
- Second, if I'm really lucky.
- Where have you been all this time?

589
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,200
What kind of university
would you like to attend?

590
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,200
Sorry, but with all due respect,
I couldn't give two shits about this.

591
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,800
It's not the right time for this.
I won't finish the school year here.

592
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,560
In fact, I plan on dropping out today.

593
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,280
Look, sir. I just want to live well.

594
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,880
But without cheating. All legit, you know?

595
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,600
And with my shitty grades...
Well, you tell me, mister.

596
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:34,280
Look, the cousin of a very dear friend,
the best student in the class, by the way,

597
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:38,320
is very interested in finding out
about the whole scholarship thing,

598
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,160
in case she could not afford to pay
for her studies for some reason.

599
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,560
I have no problem paying for college...

600
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,040
...but just in case...

601
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,536
So, I want to go
to the London College of Fashion,

602
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,160
but I also want to be with my boyfriend,
and he doesn't know what to do yet.

603
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,240
Whatever he decides,
we'll do it together or in the same city.

604
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,120
He can't live without me.

605
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,200
So, Ander,
where do you see yourself in five years?

606
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,560
In ten years?

607
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,440
What do you want to do with your future?

608
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,520
Sorry.

Hey!

00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,320
That's enough! Do you hear?

621
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,360
I won't tolerate any more of this.

622
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,920
Do you know how embarrassing
this is for the school?

623
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,440
From now on, the slightest misconduct
or lack of discipline...

624
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,280
will mean immediate expulsion.

625
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,040
No excuses, no exceptions.

626
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,240
- That means you won't graduate.
- That's unfair.

627
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,840
Very well.
Let's talk about fairness and justice.

628
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,120
The judge dropped the charges
against your classmate.

629
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,200
He is a murderer.

630
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,880
The person who accused him
retracted her statement.

631
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,200
The school has already disciplined her.

632
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,280
And she may well
face legal consequences.

633
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,880
So to make things very clear:

634
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,480
if anyone so much as touches
a hair on his head again,

635
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,840
I will personally make sure
they don't finish out the year...

636
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,400
and that it goes
on their permanent record.

637
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,480
Understood?

638
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,320
<i>I can't leave.</i>

639
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,560
So, we have to leave
as if we've done something wrong,

640
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,960
and Nano will have to spend
the rest of his life in hiding?

641
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,760
No. I won't let them get away with it.

642
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:34,040
- We need to find a way...
- To do what? What are you going to do?

643
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,240
<i>- ♪ Your eyes ♪</i>
- Fine.

644
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,896
<i>- ♪ Your smile... ♪</i>
- I'll stay with you.

645
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,720
- I won't leave you here alone.
- No.

646
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,000
Nano needs you more than I do.

647
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,840
And you need to get out of here.

648
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,920
I promise the two of you
will be able to return soon.

649
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
<i>♪ For a while now ♪</i>

650
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,720

00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,240
And who will take care of you?

652
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,880
Mom...

653
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,640
who takes care of whom in this house?

654
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,320
<i>♪ Walk with me ♪</i>

655
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,640
<i>- ♪ We'll head that way ♪

656
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,720

- Don't worry about it.

657
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,840
It's water under the bridge.

658
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,440
All is forgiven.

659
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,960
<i>♪ Now you're a home ♪</i>

660
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,320
I just want us
to put all this behind us...

661
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,360
and to start looking forward.

662
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,880
We haven't found the murder weapon,
so we're searching everybody.

663
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,360
Can I check your bag?

664
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,760
I never would have hurt him.

665
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,400
Not him.

666
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,760
I loved him.
