- No way.

to get into a place like that.

- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

- That I wanted to deal with it on my own?
- Why didn't you tell me?

158
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,480
Because Ander asked me
to keep it a secret.

159
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,280
And because I thought,
what did I have to gain from telling you?

00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,800
And then you and I
will have a very boring life.

171
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,600
I'd really like that.

172
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,240
We just found out.

173
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,800
It sucks.

174
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,680
He's tired of hiding it.

175
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,080
It's taking longer than we expected.

176
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,560
And how are you holding up?

177
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,120
Never mind me. What matters now is him.

178
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,720
I try to get him to go out, have fun,
and forget everything, but...

179
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,200
He's very lucky to have you by his side,
you know?

180
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,800
If you only knew.

181
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
I know.

182
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,840
A word of advice.

183
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,160
If you want to keep your fling a secret,
you should be more discreet.

184
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,840
But relax, I won't say a word.

185
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,960
There's no secret fling, damn it.
He's my sister's boyfriend.

186
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,600
Yeah. Crazy, huh?

187
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,000
Look, being cheated on
makes us... stronger.

188
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,080
Try to see it that way.

189
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,320
I know because my boyfriend
cheated on me with your sister.

190
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,760
- When are you going to tell her?
- Never.

191
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,040
Nadia can't leave Malick now.

192
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,040
- Why?
- She needs him to go to New York.

193
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,280
He'll also be there next year.

194
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,680
That's why my dad let her apply
for the scholarship.

195
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
If she found out
he's using her as a beard,

196
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,960
she'd scrap the whole idea. I know her.

197
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,000
- The contract has arrived.
- Has it?

198
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,160
- Mm-hmm.
- When will it be signed?

199
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,120
It's with the lawyers now.
It will take a few days.

200
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,360
The only thing is...

201
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,920
there's a clause
that allows Yeray to withdraw the funding

202
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,440
- at any time during the first five years.
- What?

203
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,640
He'll be pulling our strings
all that time.

204
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,400
- Five years?
- Mm-hmm.

205
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,320
- I'm going to tell that bastard off.
- No.

206
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,760
You won't say anything.

207
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,760
Especially not now.

208
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,640
WE HAVE SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE TONIGHT,
RIGHT?

209
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,440
Have fun.

210
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,080
Hi. I'm looking for...

211
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,760
Ah.

212
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,960
...this book.

213
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,760
Sorry, I've got it.

214
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,320
Nadia, you know it's essential
for the presentation,

215
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,400
and it's not online.

216
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,640
Well, I've got it.

217
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,560
I need to ask you a question.

218
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,240
If you knew someone was being cheated on,
would you tell them?

219
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,800
I'm sorry.

220
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,680
I never apologized to you
for what happened.

221
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,680
Why now?

222
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,680
Because... you never know
how much time we have left in this world.

223
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,320
And now that I'm starting
something serious with someone,

224
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,680
I understand you better than ever.

225
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,280
I always thought
you were cold and heartless...

226
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,640
until I helped break your heart
into pieces.

227
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,440
I'm really sorry, Lu.

228
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,920
I'm done with the book.

229
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,840
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

230
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,360
Is that what you wanted to talk about?
Or is someone else cheating?

231
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,520
No, no one.

232
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,240
Forget about it.

233
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
How are you?

234
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,760
Fine.

235
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,480
So...

236
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,640
are you training hard?
With the punching bag?

237
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,280
Do we have to speak in Morse code?

238
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,280
- Come on, you have to be fucking kidding.
- You need to be careful here, baby.

239
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,520
You should have taken
your own advice, hon.

240
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,280
I trust no one.

241
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,600
What a depressing life.
I don't want that for myself.

242
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,720
- Well, it's the life you're leading now.
- Yeah.

243
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,200
Until I get the money I need
to pay off the school.

244
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,520
- Then to hell with it.
- You'll always need more.

245
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,280
Or do you think
that once you've tasted real seafood,

246
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,480
you can go back to eating canned sardines?

247
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,336
See if you can get it
through that thick skull of yours:

248
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,240
I'll pay for every shrimp I eat
with my own work.

249
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,920
No hustling and no scumbags.
This conversation is over.

250
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,120
You can see the scumbags
coming a mile away.

251
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,360
It's the good guys,
the ones who look like angels,

252
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,240
who are the ones you have to look out for.

253
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,480
What the hell are you saying?

254
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,040
I'm saying...

255
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,600
that our living room was bugged.

256
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,320
And all the "scumbags"
were either taken down to the station

257
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,760
or are in jail.

258
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,160
All but one.

259
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,360
The little angel.

260
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,000
No. Samu would never do that to me.

261
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,080
- How do you know that?
- Because he loves me.

262
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,160
Do you know what that means?

263
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,400
What if there was a way to make sure?

264
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,000
Samu, I need to find out
who it was that stabbed us in the back.

265
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,360
You can't imagine how badly.

266
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,640
Didn't we want a boring life
with no trouble?

267
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,080
Are you with me or not?

268
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,000
<i>The snitch
must be on the security footage.</i>

269
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,720
<i>We had cameras everywhere,
but the police confiscated them.</i>

270
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,560
<i>But if we're lucky, the security company
will have a copy of everything.</i>

271
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,040
<i>But my mom doesn't know
which company we had,</i>

272
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,040
<i>and the police seized all the contracts,
invoices, and everything.</i>

273
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,720
<i>A couple of months ago,
one of the cameras broke, and I kept it.</i>

274
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,600
<i>It should have a sticker
with the company's details on it.</i>

275
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,280
Why would they give you
a copy of the tape?

276
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,520
Because everyone has a price, Samu.

277
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,640
- Look over there.
<i>- ♪ Now I'm back ♪</i>

278
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,960
<i>♪ More venomous lyrics
To claim a victim ♪</i>

279
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,840
<i>♪ I get a lot of love
From kids with backpacks ♪</i>

280
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,320
It's here.

281
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,280
Shit, there's nothing on it.

282
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,040
You could try calling
all the security companies in the country

283
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,760
and see if you were clients.

284
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,960
Although I think
that'd be confidential information.

285
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,520
I don't know. It's your call.

286
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,520
Wait a minute, wait a minute...

287
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,280
Maybe there's no need for that.

288
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,200
Why are you here?

289
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,880
I came to...

290
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,320
to see if I can do anything for you.

291
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,200
If you need money,

292
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,760
I could get you the best doctors.

293
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,560
What country do you think we live in,
Polo?

294
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,320
I already have the best doctors...

295
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,880
and I don't need to be rich
or be a charity case to get them.

296
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,160
Money's your answer to everything, huh?

297
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,200
I just want to help.

298
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,200
But I don't know how.

299
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,400
Do you have plans right now?
I'm bored out of my mind.

300
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,120
How many more chemo sessions
do you have left?

301
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,760
I don't know.
The last session is next week.

302
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,880
Then I'll get the results,
and they'll tell me if I'm done.

303
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,520
Right.
Does it really fuck you up afterwards?

304
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,880
Omar says I look like the girl
from<i> The Exorcist.</i>

305
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,120
How are things going with him?

306
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,680
This whole thing's a bummer.
Awful timing.

307
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,480
Well...

308
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,680
bad times are great for finding out
who will stay by your side.

309
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,800
Do you mean Cayetana?

310
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,520
And Valerio.

311
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,960
- You're cheating on her with Valerio?
- No, I'm not cheating. I swear.

312
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,480
But...

313
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,600
well, we're together. The three of us.

314
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,240
Fuck.

315
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,000
You're getting laid more than anyone.

316
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,520
But it's not just about getting laid.
There's more to it than that.

317
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,280
And I think it's going well.

318
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,440
I guess it's not exactly normal,

319
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,360
but... who cares about being normal...

320
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,040
if you can be happy?

321
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,640
Shit, you've gone all Zen,
and you're not even high.

322
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,760
- Let me try that.
- Just a little.

323
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,560
How does this go?

324
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,920
Badly. At first, it's always bad.

325
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,040
- Holy shit.
- It's strong stuff.

326
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,240
Do you like sushi?

327
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,400
I'm not hungry.

328
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,920
No.

329
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,200
Uh, I was thinking
we could go on vacation to Japan.

330
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,680
Well, a lot could happen
between now and then.

331
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,640
Are you upset
over that kid in your class?

332
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,480
Mm-hmm.

333
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,920
I see.

334
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,400
I bought you something.

335
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,960
Stay the night.

336
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,120
Tonight... and as many nights as you want.

337
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,920
Just look at his eyes...

338
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,920
Ah.

339
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,240
I love you so much, guys.
I really do. I love you a lot.

340
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,560
Aww, so let's see...

341
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,880
You told Ander that we're together,
the three of us?

342
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,440
- Correct.
- Right.

343
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,960
And what if he tells someone?
What do we do?

344
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,040
It's no big deal.
We've all been called worse.

345
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,480
It felt good to say it out loud.

346
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,200
That the three of us are together.

347
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,440
Why do we have to stop being three
when we've only just started?

348
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,840
Why don't you come to London?
Huh, cute curls?

349
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,360
My mothers will be asking
for a <i>couple </i>of favors already,

350
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,760
but they can ask for three.

351
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,680
One, two...

352
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,800
- and three.
- But how will you convince them?

353
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,240
I don't know.

354
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,520
Right.

355
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,960
I know a girl who is very good
at making up crazy stories.

356
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,560
Well, to be honest,
it's kind of my superpower.

357
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,800
- Is it?
- It is, right?

358
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,240
What if you show me more
of that superpower?

359
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,920
Yeah?

360
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,440
Mm, I just can't resist...

361
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,640
<i>♪ And my heart is not gonna rage... ♪</i>

362
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,000
Mm!
Let's go in the pool, the three of us.

363
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,000
What's he doing?

364
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,600
- Yeah, let's go in.
- Okay.

365
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,000
- Let's go in the water!
- Let's go!

366
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,080
We can do it inside, right?

367
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,120
- Let's go.
- Wow!

368
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,760
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

369
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,960
Stop! Stop!

370
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,240
Whoo-hoo!

371
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,920
Hey, there's a full moon!

372
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,320
What's all this?

373
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,280
- Huh?
- What on earth are you doing?

374
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,560
Hello, Moms!

375
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,640
You're back already?

376
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,840
What's wrong?

377
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,760
- How are you? I think we know each other.
- Too well.

378
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,200
I've seen far too much of you.

379
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,480
This is not what it looks like.

380
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,680
We were studying outside,
and we just felt like...

381
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,080
- Shut up.
- Well, I'm leaving.

382
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,920
It's not that big of a deal.

383
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,600
- What, having an orgy at home?
- There are only three of us.

384
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,120
- Technically, it's not an orgy.
- Mom...

385
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,040
- it's not just about sex.
- What?

386
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,680
We're dating.

387
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,400
The three of us.

388
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,456
How can you be with two people
at the same time? That makes no sense!

389
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,080
- Why not?
- What do you mean, why not?

390
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,320
Have you ever seen a thing like that?

391
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,840
Do you think this is normal?

392
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,440
Isn't that what your parents said
when you said you liked girls?

393
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,720
That's enough, Polo!
It's always a struggle with you.

394
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,280
Don't we have enough problems already?
And now this?

395
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,280
- Hey.
- Hi.

396
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,440
It suits you.

397
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,280
Listen, if you need anything,
anything at all...

398
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,640
I mean, I'm not going to shave my hair off
for moral support,

399
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,520
- but if you need anything else...
- Thanks.

400
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,560
I'm fed up with all the sad looks.
I don't know what's worse, chemo or pity.

401
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,440
Pity, for sure.

402
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,280
But it's not all shitty.

403
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,480
Cancer also has an upside.

404
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,640
Really? Like what?

405
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,400
Well... I don't know. I used to stress
about what to do with my life.

406
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,800
My future, my parents
constantly breathing down my neck...

407
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,600
We spend so much time thinking
about the future

408
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,160
that we forget the present.

409
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,120
I only do what I want now, and I like it.

410
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,720
Oh, sorry.

411
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,720
Another side effect
is that I talk like a Buddhist master.

412
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,000
It's like I have a master's in philosophy
instead of a tumor.

413
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,040
I don't know about the master's,
but you're right.

414
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:35,200
SORRY ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT.
CAN WE MEET?

415
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,480
Good morning.

416
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,080
Hey.

417
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,440
Are you okay?

418
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,600
Uh, yeah. Yep, yep, yep, yep.

419
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,720
Just a bit nervous about the exams.

420
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,000
Hey, do you want to study with me tonight?

421
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,280
I made plans to go to the club.

422
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,640
- Who with?
- Some friends.

423
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,480
From class.

424
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,320
And... and how are you today?

425
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,480
- Fine.
- Yeah?

426
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,720
Mm-hmm.

427
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,280
See you.

428
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,720
See? I told you, kid.

429
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,680
Everyone has a price.
Some of us are cheaper than others.

430
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,160
It's all set.
I'll get the hard drive tonight.

431
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,400
But you don't even know that guy.

432
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,360
Of course, genius.
That's why I'm meeting him at the club.

433
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,760
It's the blackout party,
and you can do anything in the dark.

434
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,120
Anything?

435
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,040
- Except crochet.
- I'm going with you, just in case.

436
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,320
Okay, Dad.

437
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,720
Rebe, what would you do
if you knew Samu was cheating on you?

438
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,480
- What?
- Why are you asking?

439
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,320
I don't know. Intuition.

440
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,120
The only way to be sure
is by catching him red-handed.

441
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,960
Are you nuts?

442
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,080
What's wrong?

443
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,160
- Are you upset about last night?
- No.

444
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Well... maybe they're right, you know?

445
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,280
I've been a problem my whole life.
That's my superpower.

446
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,560
Let's see. Let's see.

447
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,680
Polo's mothers might be lesbians,
but they're older.

448
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,240
Okay? They don't get it.

449
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,040
I don't get it either, to be honest.

450
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,520
I'm not going to pretend
I'm super progressive, but...

451
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:46,360
it's because girls don't dream of having
a white wedding with two grooms, you know?

452
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,440
It's not what we were taught.

453
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,120
I used to think...

454
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,480
that people were like halves
trying to make a whole.

455
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,440
Or like nuts and bolts.

456
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:03,120
All you had to do was find
the one who fit you perfectly.

457
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,880
But Polo and I didn't fit together before.

458
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,480
But you showed up...

459
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,920
and now we do fit together.

460
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,320
Hey, you're our missing piece.

461
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,360
And, fuck...

462
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,600
when you find love,
having to let it slip away sucks.

463
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,360
Guzmán, are you going to the party?

464
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,280
Omar wants me to go
so that I'm not alone all day.

465
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,840
Why don't you go with Polo?

466
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,160
I saw you two last night at your house.
You were having a blast.

467
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,920
So that's it, huh?

468
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,040
We forget and just carry on
like nothing ever happened?

469
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,560
Maybe that's the problem.
I forgave you too soon.

470
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,280
The champagne bottle broke.

471
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,760
The neck fell by the restroom,
and I went to pick it up.

472
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,360
And then?

473
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,880
Someone beat me to it.

474
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,520
Who?

475
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,160
Guzmán. He bent down,
picked it up, and entered the restroom.

476
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,920
You saw him with your own eyes?

477
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,800
You saw Guzmán?

478
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,760
Is that Yeray?

479
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,320
- Yes.
- Aren't you going to pick up?

480
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,680
No. I'm going to break up with him
as soon as I finish my dinner.

481
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,080
- What happened?
- Carla.

482
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,200
What happened?
Do you want to know what happened?

483
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,480
What we've been hiding from you
for weeks?

484
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,560
Dad has practically been pimping me
so that Yeray will save the winery.

485
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,080
It's the only reason I'm with him!

486
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,480
I don't love him,
and I never fucking will!

487
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,880
You knew?

488
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,320
And agreed to it?

489
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,920
Don't make
the same mistake that I made, Carla.

490
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,680
I also had a Yeray,
but I chose someone I loved over him.

491
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,320
Hm. And look at us now.

492
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,640
People who are not of our standing,

493
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,920
they think we didn't make
any sacrifices to get here.

494
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,040
But they don't know

495
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,680
we're capable of doing anything
to avoid losing our status.

496
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,480
Anything.

497
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,520
Learning to love that boy is easier
than learning to live with nothing.

498
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,560
Think about your future, honey.

499
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,960
About our future.

500
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,320
You're crazy, Valerio.

501
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,000
We can't deal at the club!

502
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,320
Remember when my mom
expanded outside of her territory?

503
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,840
Know what the problem is?
What we make at school isn't enough.

504
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,920
Not enough for what?

505
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,480
Life doesn't end when we graduate.
That's when it starts.

506
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,560
What the hell do you need that money for?

507
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,720
I need thousands of euros within a month,

508
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,760
before the enrollment deadline
for the good universities is up.

509
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,920
And so do you, right?

510
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,560
Or will you be going back
to public education?

511
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,080
- Are you guys ready?
- Of course.

512
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,160
Do you see him?

513
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,000
No.

514
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,200
But there's still time
before the blackout.

515
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,760
Why don't I talk to him?
I don't trust him.

516
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,480
Relax, Mike Tyson.
I'm the one who taught you how to box.

517
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I'll be right back.

518
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,520
Your water, sir.

519
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,640
Eh, easy. It's a bit strong.

520
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,440
- What the hell am I doing here?
- Having a good time, like everyone else.

521
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,080
Come on, loosen up.

522
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,320
Guzmán.

523
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,200
Are you not coming
to the hospital on Monday either?

524
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,360
I'm sure you have
another friend to go with you.

525
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,440
Resentment is a luxury I can't afford.

526
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,200
Because I don't know
how much longer I'll be here.

527
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,720
If I have only months left,
would you rather not see me again?

528
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,320
If you'd known how long Marina had left,
wouldn't you have liked

529
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,600
to have forgotten all the problems
and been by her side?

530
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,360
They say the key to success
is to turn your hobby into your job,

531
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,480
- so congratulations.
- It's a job, and it's also a secret.

532
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,600
Can you not say anything about it?

533
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,920
I can make it up to you.

534
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,920
You've got the wrong person.
That's not my thing.

535
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,760
Yeah? And what is your thing?

536
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,440
What do you need?

537
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,480
I just need to fall in love.

538
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,320
Boom! I have just the thing for that.

539
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,000
This is... happiness...

540
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,080
and love.

541
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,360
Good.

542
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,080
Mm.

543
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,640
How are you?

544
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,680
It's fine. Go home. Don't stay for me.

545
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,600
Will you be up when I get home?

546
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,640
I can't dance, let alone fuck.

547
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,200
That's not what I meant, but it's okay.

548
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:49,160
It's not okay. We should admit that.

549
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,800
And, listen.

550
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,160
- I don't care if you see other people.
- Why are you saying that?

551
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,480
I know it's not conventional,

552
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,200
but I want you to be happy.
Right now you're bitter because of me.

553
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,320
Do you think I like that?

554
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,400
No... I don't understand, Ander.
I don't get it.

555
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,480
Fine, forget it.

556
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,960
Watch this for me.
I'm going to the restroom.

557
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,280
Omar, throw this in the trash
without being seen.

558
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,440
- What?
- Trust me.

559
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,640
- Just do it!
- Okay.

560
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,520
What is this about?

561
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,680
I just...

562
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,360
I just remembered
that I lost your toothbrush.

563
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,680
- Can you buy me a new one?
- Sure.

564
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,680
No. Buy me thousands.
Millions of toothbrushes.

565
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,600
Sorry, babe. The ladies' restroom
was as crowded as the Tokyo subway.

566
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,760
- Mm. Want another drink?
- Sure.

567
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,160
Shit.

568
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,360
- What's wrong?
- Where's my bag?

569
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,680
- Shit...
- Fuck me!

570
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,840
