"She was still alive when I left.
Poor thing.

22
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,960
I should have hit her harder."

23
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,120
This is a crime. It's harassment.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,120
What if I told my parents
to pay for a study program?

25
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,480
Would you still think it's a crime?

26
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,920
- What are you trying to achieve?
- We want him gone.

27
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,936
I DIDN'T WANT TO KILL HER...
I HAD NOTHING AGAINST MARINA.

28
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,360
IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANYONE,
EVEN YOU.

29
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,640
Hey.

30
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,720
Are you okay?

31
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,280
Leave me alone.

32
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,520
- Polo.
- Hey.

33
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,000
- What the hell are you doing?
- Right now, he needs to be alone, okay?

34
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,040
And I need you to leave <i>me </i>alone.

39
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,040
Polo, honey. What happened?
You're back early.

40
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,280
We have an exam first thing tomorrow,
and I have a lot to study.

41
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
What exam?

42
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,520
- Uh... well, it's...
- Polo.

43
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,880
The principal called this morning.

44
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,400
She told us about the Twitter account.
Why didn't you say something to us?

45
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,720
I don't want you to look at me
like they do.

46
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,440
They deactivated the account.

47
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,040
Yes, Mom, <i>one </i>account's been deactivated.
Just one.

48
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,640
As if that'll do any good.

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,560
I don't want to go back to that school.
Seriously.

50
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,560
That'd be like saying they're right.

51
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,000
You have to be stronger.

52
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,920
Be a man, son.

53
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,880
You know what I mean.

54
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,440
Well... if it isn't Las Encinas'
own Bill Gates.

55
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,240
How about if we skip training
and study together?

56
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,480
Psst. Hey, I'm talking to you, man.

57
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,240
Okay. See you at my place in an hour?

58
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
Okay.

59
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,440
Ciao!

60
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,120
Thanks for the lift.

61
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,520
I just want to introduce myself
to your parents.

62
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,120
Fine. As long as it happens
sometime this century.

63
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,880
Hi, Mom.

64
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
What's wrong?

65
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,080
Are you okay?

66
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,760
Is Dad all right?

67
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,480
I found this university brochure
with your things this morning.

68
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,240
Dad...

69
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,520
Dad. Look, Dad...

70
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,600
This program is a great opportunity.

71
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,560
My only opportunity.
What other options do I have?

72
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,160
You, all alone there? You're just a girl.

73
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,600
She wouldn't be all alone.

74
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,400
- Peace be upon you.
- And peace be upon you.

75
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,800
- I'm Malick, Nadia's friend.
- What are you doing?

76
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,800
Uh... next year,
I'll also be studying in New York,

77
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,760
and... I'd be happy to take care of her.

78
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,520
My dad studied at that university,
and he speaks highly of it.

79
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,120
Thanks to his studies,

80
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,440
he diversified his grandfather's
gold mine business,

81
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,840
and now he has
the biggest telecommunications company

82
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,320
in all of Africa.

83
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,640
I think it's a great opportunity.

84
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,640
Why haven't you told us about him?

85
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,720
Um, uh...

86
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,840
A-Actually, I wanted to come here
and introduce myself first.

87
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,360
And...

88
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,000
...and ask permission to take Nadia
to the Madrid mosque.

89
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,560
I go every week,
and it's a pity she can't go more often.

90
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,720
Hmm. Fine.

91
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,640
What happened?

92
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,320
- Nothing bad.
- Nothing bad?

93
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,200
Since when are you
the bearer of good news?

94
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,920
Mind coming
to the police station with me?

95
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,840
The prosecutor
handling your brother's case

96
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,720
seems willing to drop the charges.

97
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,280
Your brother could come back
as a free man.

98
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,680
And your mother as well.
They wouldn't need to hide anymore.

99
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,160
What do you mean, "seems willing"?

100
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,680
He already has doubts due to the lack
of evidence against Nano, but...

101
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,120
I believe we can totally convince him.

102
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,480
You "believe"?

103
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,000
We went to the same school.
He sat next to me.

104
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,240
- We've been friends ever since.
- Right.

105
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,040
That's how things work, right?
Underhanded deals among friends.

106
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,000
Power isn't fair.

107
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,040
But for once,
you can make it work for you.

108
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,720
All we ask for is one thing in return.

109
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,560
We've been monitoring
Sandra López Gallego for a while.

110
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,840
Your friend's mother.

111
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,560
We know you've run some errands for her,
but we can't use that.

112
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,320
What we need is evidence.

113
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,000
We need someone who can enter
her house without it being suspicious

114
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,800
and plant a small listening device.

115
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,760
I'm not doing it.

116
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,976
If it's because of your friend...

117
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Her name's Rebeca.

118
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,600
Think about Nano...

119
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,280
and your mother. Think about your family.

120
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,040
Think it over.

121
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,320
Darling, are you okay?

122
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,480
Yes.

123
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,800
Let me know if you need anything.

124
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,480
I ONLY USED MY GIRLFRIEND
SO THAT I COULD FUCK CHRISTIAN.

125
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,760
MURDERERS HAVE A LITTLE HEART TOO.

126
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,320
Another tweet.

127
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,640
Your friends are really something.

128
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,240
Samuel isn't a bad person.

129
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,120
- And neither is Guzmán.
- Right.

130
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,240
He can't be a bad person
if you went out with him.

131
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,160
Know what?
He's a Christian version of you.

132
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,560
You both think you're knights
in shining armor who have to rescue me.

133
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,520
I don't need to be taken care of.

134
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,680
Excuse me?

135
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,880
I wasn't planning on it.

136
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,080
Oh, please...

137
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,200
It's true that I'll be in New York
next year and everything,

138
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,240
but you don't need to see me
if you don't want to.

139
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,280
I only said that to convince your dad.

140
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,760
So...

141
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,960
So much for Allah's perfect son!
You lied to my family?

142
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,520
Thanks to that, you'll follow your dream,
and they won't worry about it.

143
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,800
- That's not so sinful, is it?
- Right.

144
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,960
So, you decide what's sinful
and what isn't.

145
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,480
I take certain liberties.

146
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,120
I stray a little to come back
with more gusto.

147
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,440
What liberties?

148
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,280
If you want to know,
come to the Silicon Valley party.

149
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,400
No. My parents don't let me go to clubs.

150
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,040
They will
if you're with Allah's perfect son.

151
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,440
- Where the hell were you?
- Oh, shit.

152
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,480
- Sorry, my phone died.
- Really? Well, maybe it's broken

153
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,560
'cause the messages I sent you
showed up as "read."

154
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,800
Look, Samu.

155
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,360
I don't know what's up,
but I can take a guess.

156
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,720
I wasn't born yesterday.

157
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,120
If you want to be a marquis,
tell me to fuck off,

158
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,080
and we can both stop wasting our time.

159
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,440
You met up with her again, right?

160
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,880
- I was with the police.
- No way.

161
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,040
Yeah, about my brother.
Same shit as always.

162
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,880
Sorry.

163
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,200
I'm sorry. I'm losing it.

164
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,920
I don't know why,
but I feel insecure around you.

165
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,520
Me, who would've guessed?

166
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,520
What can I do to fix that?

167
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,560
I don't know.

168
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,640
Maybe you could come over here
and stick your tongue down my throat.

169
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,600
Come on, let's hit the books.

170
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,880
Were you serious about studying?

171
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,240
- Sure.
- Since when do you want to study?

172
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,760
Since I don't want to end up like my mom,
in seriously deep shit.

173
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,200
That can't end well.

174
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,760
Oh. So, now you're responding
to messages again?

175
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,856
CAN WE TALK? IT'S ABOUT POLO.

176
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,880
It's Omar.

177
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
What's going on?

178
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,120
Well, well, well...
what are we celebrating here?

179
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,760
It's a private party, freak.

180
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,440
Sure. Does this have anything to do
with those messages?

181
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,640
Don't you have a line of coke to snort
or something?

182
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,960
Is that an invitation?
I love it!

183
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,560
An invitation to leave.

184
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,560
This is my house too.
Just so you all know, okay?

185
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,920
We just want to talk privately
for a moment

186
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,120
Okay.

187
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,080
- Have a drink. Make yourself at home.
- Thanks.

188
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,400
Can we get
this fucking charade over with?

189
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,560
- You need to stop this.
- We owe it to Marina.

190
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,720
That's not true.

191
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,600
You're doing it for yourselves, not her.
Because you need revenge.

192
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,320
No, we don't need revenge,

193
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,840
but we won't let a killer
go free like nothing happened.

194
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,600
Life is too short, you know?

195
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,760
- It's not worth wasting.
- What the fuck do you know about life?

196
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,240
- Why do you keep protecting him?
- Because Polo...

197
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,840
Polo tried to kill himself.

198
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,400
Holy shit, Las Encinas...

199
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,720
I told him I'd tell on him
if he didn't turn himself in...

200
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,040
and he almost killed himself.

201
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,560
Wait, are you saying this to get me
to forgive him or forgive you?

202
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,240
- Guzmán.
- Let me tell you...

203
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,400
he deserves everything
that's happening to him.

204
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,680
I hope one day you get
what you deserve, too.

205
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,720
Are we done here?

206
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,720
Mm! There'll be a photo-call,
over 100 guests,

207
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,720
and the best catering in Madrid...

208
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,640
It's not every day
that your company goes public, is it?

209
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,880
Hm.

210
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,120
- What color are you going to wear?
- Why?

211
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,040
- Are you buying a tie to match?
- No.

212
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,840
A car.

213
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,000
That's all I am to you, right?

214
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,320
An accessory that matches your new car?

215
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,520
You know...

216
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,360
those movies where the fat kid
with the sweaty palms

217
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,400
never gets invited to the party?
He never gets invited to anything.

218
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,600
Well, that's me.

219
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,840
<i>Used </i>to be me.

220
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,000
And now, it's my party.

221
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,720
I choose who gets invited and who doesn't,

222
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,360
and I'm taking
the most wonderful girl in the world.

223
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,400
I just want everything to be perfect.

224
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,800
And you are the center of it all,

225
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,280
so all the accessories have to match you.

226
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,960
Tell me what you want...

227
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
anything...

228
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,520
and it'll be yours.

229
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,960
Yeray, what I don't have
can't be bought with money.

230
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,920
Well...

231
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,080
- Thanks for driving me home.
- That's okay.

232
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,080
Good night.

233
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,440
B-B-But wait.

234
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,120
What time should I pick you up tomorrow?

235
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,080
Yeray, I don't know if I can go,
after all.

236
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,840
Why not? I mean...

237
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,320
Who's that?

238
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
My dad.

239
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,080
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

240
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,160
I'm Yeray.

241
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,800
- Carla's classmate.
- Yes, I know who you are.

242
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,680
I saw you in the latest issue of <i>Forbes.</i>
Impressive.

243
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,960
- Congratulations on your IPO.
- We're throwing a party tomorrow.

244
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,880
I was just telling Carla...

245
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,360
Why don't you and your wife
come along with her?

246
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,440
Of course. We'd be delighted.

247
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,040
We'll be there.

248
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,280
Pleased to meet you.

249
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,080
What are you wearing the uniform for?
You have chemo today.

250
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,520
I'm not going.

251
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,320
- What?
- I'm not going to do the chemo.

252
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,320
Not worth it. You saw the chances.

253
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,960
Ander, we've talked about this.

254
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,080
I know we talked about it,
but I'm fed up...

255
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,800
with this crap about staying strong
and optimistic.

256
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,080
All this stuff about fighting till the end
with a smile on my face.

257
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,000
Can you imagine that kind of pressure?

258
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,760
I'm sick.

259
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,160
I don't have the strength to go.

260
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,000
Don't make me feel bad about that too.

261
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,040
- I just want to be by your side.
- I want you by my side, too.

262
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,040
But support my decisions.
Don't decide for me.

263
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,720
Psst! Look, Polo isn't here.

264
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,280
...of the collective unconscious.

265
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,160
Maybe something happened to him.

266
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,800
I wish.

267
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,960
What could've happened to him?
He's scared shitless. That's all.

268
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,560
Samu.

269
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,600
I came up with our next tweet.

270
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,920
We'll let everyone know
Polo tried to kill himself.

271
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,640
- Guzmán, man...
- What?

272
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,120
It's his sister, Samuel.

273
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,600
I don't know what I'd do
if anyone touched my family.

274
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,200
What if we wait a little?

275
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,240
- Maybe this was enough.
- Why do you think that?

276
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,520
Guzmán, Samuel,
are you following me? Come on.

277
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,880
Let's say heroism is a choice...

278
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,840
Polo, you have a visitor.
It's Cayetana.

279
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,000
He's not answering.
You should go.

280
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,800
Okay, give me a second.
Let me try this.

281
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,520
What are you doing?

282
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,240
Let me try this, please.

283
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,520
Polo, it's me.

284
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,040
Polo...

285
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,240
Come on, go to school.

286
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,040
Andrea, let's let them talk alone.

287
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,800
We'll be in the living room
if you need anything.

288
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,000
Okay, thanks.

289
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,440
Thank you.

290
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,120
- Let's forget about Polo, okay?
- A bottle of champagne, please.

291
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,680
- Are you going to let him come between us?
- Get away from me, okay?

292
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,400
Here you are, guys.

295
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,160
Hello, sweetheart!

296
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,040
Where's Mom?

297
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,600
In bed. She has a stomachache.

298
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,440
Go on, get changed.
I want to get there early.

299
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,680
- I'm not going.
- What?

300
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,080
Why not?

301
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,880
Why should I?

302
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,960
I'm not going to embarrass myself
looking for investors

303
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,120
to save the wineries.

304
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,080
Do you know what Yeray drank at dinner?

305
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,880
Coca-Cola. He knows nothing about wine,
and he's not interested.

306
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,680
Well, I don't know...

307
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,120
he seemed <i>very </i>interested to me.

308
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,960
I'm not going to go there
and put on an act with you.

309
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,160
- Carla...
- I'd rather stay in and look after Mom.

310
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,480
- I'm taking care of her too.
- Really?

311
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,360
Yes. She's not sick.

312
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,760
She's devastated.

313
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,640
She just found out
we are on the verge of bankruptcy.

314
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,240
So...

315
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,120
if you want to take care of her...

316
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,480
you know what you have to do.

317
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,280
Well, well...

318
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,600
Don't you look elegant.

319
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,280
Come here, give me a kiss.

320
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,240
Hey, I'm glad that you're okay.

321
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,080
- That was some scare you gave us, damn it.
- You almost got me killed.

322
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,920
Is this how you talk
to your future mother-in-law?

323
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,200
- We're off to a bad start.
- You're playing with fire.

324
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,880
The thugs, the police...

325
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,640
Why don't you stop?

326
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,040
Oh, Samuel, you're a good kid.

327
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,760
- Thanks.
- No, that wasn't a compliment.

328
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,560
So tell me. Where has that gotten you?

329
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,120
You live in a dump,
you work for a pittance,

330
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,240
- and let's not even mention your brother.
- Should I be an asshole, then?

331
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,480
You need to do what is best
for you and your loved ones.

332
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,800
And if you screw someone over
along the way, too bad for them.

333
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,280
And if that makes me an asshole, so be it.

334
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,680
And as for you, you'll see.

335
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,880
Where has being a good kid gotten you?
Hmm?

339
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,280
Wow. I wasn't expecting to see you here.

340
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,720
Carla convinced me.
She really wanted to come.

341
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,240
Well, that's not what she told me.

342
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:58,400
Uh... well, excuse her.
I don't know where her head is lately.

343
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,960
Why don't you come by the winery one day
and we'll make it up to you?

344
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,680
Anyway, you might be interested.

345
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,880
We're looking for investors.
I'd like to tell you all about it.

346
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,920
Sure.

347
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,680
I'm sorry, but they're waiting for me.

348
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,880
- Enjoy the party.
- We will.

349
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,400

351
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,920
Yeray.

00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,480
You know the only good thing
about being poor?

353
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,720
People approach you for who you really are
and not for your money.

354
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,480
- Yeray...

356
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,880

359
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,800
Your money made me change my mind.

360
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,560
Pfft. How romantic.

361
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,880
But you know why?

362
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,280
You made it all by yourself.

363
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,640
No help, no cheating.

364
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,000
No desperate father asking for favors
and making a fool of you at a party.

365
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,040
Right.

My body?

My last name?

371
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,040
I can't take credit for any of it.

372
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,720
But everything you have,
you earned it yourself.

373
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,160

379
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,040
Everything's fine.

380
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,040
Holy shit.
Is this a club or a retirement home?

381
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,520
I need to go to the bathroom for a second,
okay, hon?

382
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,560
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

383
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,280
- I'm sorry.
- What?

384
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,200
When you saved Polo's ass,
I thought you were a coward.

385
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,680
But no, you were being brave.

386
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,400
You did what you had to do
to protect your family,

387
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,440
even though you had to pay
a very high price.

388
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I get it now.

389
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,400
I didn't have to sacrifice much.

390
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,680
You lost Lu, Guzmán, and me.

391
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,600
I'd known you for all of five minutes.
In five months, I won't see you again,

392
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,000
and in five years,
I won't even remember your name.

393
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,720
Samu?

394
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,520
Holy shit. What's with the long faces?

395
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,800
What do you say
we have a drink, guys?

396
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,120
- You've gotta be fucking kidding me.
- That motherfucker.

397
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,720
- So much for "maybe that's enough," huh?
- Come on, guys.

398
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,640
Now it's time to go grab that drink.

399
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,040
Come on, let's move.

400
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,600
Let's calm down. It's all right.

401
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,120
Testing, testing. Can you hear me?

402
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,640
Good evening, everyone. Thanks for coming.

403
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,200
Uh, as you know,

404
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,080
this all started with a dating app
that was so great,

405
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,040
none of our users
needed to have it installed

406
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,480
for more than five minutes.

407
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,920
- That's a bad joke, but it's a good app.
- Hey, I'm with you.

408
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,000
It all started as a dating app...

409
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,520
but now... it's become much more
than that. Now...

410
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,080
You're too nice for your own good.
And I'm an idiot for listening to you.

411
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,000
People here do whatever they want, Samu.

412
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,760
- ...more than a date or a hookup.
- I'd beat his ass.

413
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,200
Our users
want a comprehensive experience.

414
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,280
They want to...

415
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,240
- Guzmán!
- I'm going to the restroom!

416
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,960
...they want investors,
even travel companions.

417
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,040
Our VIPs...

418
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,680
You're right.

419
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,520
Okay,
but where the hell are you going?

420
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,440
Ready? Ten, nine, eight,

421
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:29,120
seven, six, five, four,

422
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,360
three, two, one...

423
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,376
I want a gin and tonic. What about you?

424
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,080
You drink alcohol?

425
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,280
Don't tell your father.

426
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,600
Or mine.

427
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,360
Okay, okay,
so are these are the liberties you take?

428
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:20,440
Imagine you could choose
three free passes for tonight.

429
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,520
Mm-hmm.

430
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,680
I've already chosen one: alcohol.

431
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,920
What about you?

432
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,080

Sometimes it's enough to be a good child.

439

And you are.

440
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,240

Polo wanted to die.

No, no, that's not true.

455
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,600
Who sent you? Guzmán or Samuel?

456
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,000
What are you saying?
No, it's not like that.

457
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,360
Not like that at all.

458
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,040
I'm not one for obeying orders,
and I don't like bullies, either.

459
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,240
- Okay.
- I don't like how they look at you.

460
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,080
How do they look at us?

461
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,120
The same way they've looked at me
all my life.

462
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,880
You don't have to hang out with us
out of pity.

463
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,120
Who said I'm here out of pity?
I'm here because...

464
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,360
because, c'mon, you guys
are the most interesting couple here.

465
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,920
- Sure.
- Who?

466
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,720
I mean...
are you talking about us?

467
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,080
Yes, Polo. And, yes, I know everything.

468
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,760
Your threesome with Christian.

469
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,560
That really turned me on, by the way.

470
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,120

Wow!

477
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,480
You are fascinating.

478
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,520
Much more than when you were
just another dull rich girl.

479
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,840
Hm.

480
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,280
Fine, Valerio,
but... I'm not as fascinating as you.

481
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,280
I mean, you did snort
your entire family fortune up your nose.

482
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,120
Exactly. Absolutely right.

483
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,200
How do you see it?
'Cause I think it's crystal clear.

484
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,320
We're unique.

487
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,640
I know what I want to spend...

488
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,560
- my next free pass on.
- Oh, really?

489
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,240
Okay, surprise me.

490
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,280
I want to kiss you.

491
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,520
- No, no, no.
- No, huh?

492
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,600
- No.
- No.

493
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,200
No problem.

494
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,320
I'm going to kiss <i>you.</i>

495
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,200
Damn, what a plot twist.

496
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,560
Forget it.
Samuel isn't answering.

497
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,360
I guess it's not...

498
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,120
What if we look for him
and throw our own little party?

499
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,960
Hello?

500
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,120
No, no... I don't think so.

501
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,480
- Guzmán, go home.
<i>- He's </i>the one who should leave.

502
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,320
Come on.

503
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,520
Excuse me, have we met before?

504
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,840
Are we friends? We're not, are we?

505
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,840
Then get out of my sight.

506
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,040
Get lost!

507
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,560
Why don't you leave him alone?

508
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,760
For fuck's sake. He had it coming.
I'm not taking it back.

509
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,240
He's sick, for fuck's sake!

510
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,880
He's sick?

511
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,800
What did you just say, Omar?
What's wrong? What does he have?

512
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,280
So you kept quiet about that too?

513
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,720
You told him?

514
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,280
- Sorry, Ander, I had to...
- I told you not to tell anyone.

515
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,400
It's my business!

516
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,880
What did I do to deserve
to be left out of the loop?

517
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,360
Nothing.

518
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,920
You didn't do anything wrong.

519
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,120
In fact, you were right.

520
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,800
I kept Polo's secret,
and it's eating me up inside.

521
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,360
No way.

522
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,840
What?

523
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,200
Don't tell me that's why you don't want
to undergo chemo.

524
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,160
What do you mean
you don't want to?

525
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,080
Get out of here, Omar.

526
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,120
- Excuse me?
- Go away!

527
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,120
Ander.

528
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,800
Why don't you want to undergo chemo?

529
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,040
Do you want to die?

530
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,880
You're going to the hospital,
even if I have to drag you there.

531
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,120
No matter what you did,
it has nothing to do with it.

532
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,080
Nobody deserves that.

533
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,360
Excuse me.
Can I have another gin and tonic?

534
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,800
What's this? Didn't you used to wear
a hijab even in the shower?

535
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,400
It's my free pass.

536
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,480
Your what?

537
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,680
Explain it to him.

538
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,800
He's my brother, Omar.
This is Malick, a friend.

539
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,120
I just told Nadia that...

540
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,600
it's good to take a break from the rules

541
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,400
so you don't explode one day and say,
"To hell with it all."

542
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,040
Maybe that's the secret
to not ending up like me.

543
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,880
Um... Omar exploded and said,
"To hell with it all."

544
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,560
He left home.

545
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,600
Uh, oh... why?

546
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,160
I don't get along with my father.

547
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,600
And he can't handle having a gay son.

548
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,440
Oh.

549
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,680

550

551
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,200
Yes. Yeah, I'm gay. Got a problem with it?

552
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,000
- No, of course not.
- Right.

553
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,080
Too much of a free pass for you, Malick?

554
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,600
Anyway, I have to get back to work.
I'm going back in.

555
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,600
Mm-hmm.

557
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,240
Let's have one last drink and go home.

558
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,280
- Last round?
- Last round.

559
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,920
- All right. Last round.
- Okay?

560
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,600
- Okay. Champagne? My favorite.
- Okay. Last one.

561
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,000
- Bartender! Bring me a bottle.
- Okay, okay.

562
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,800
Last round.

563
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,640
- Do you like him?
- No!

564
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,080
- No, no, what?
- Relax, relax.

565
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,880
I'm just... glad someone
can bear to talk to me.

566
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,600
- Finally.
- It's fine if you like him.

567
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,480
I wouldn't mind if...

568
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,400
- I wouldn't mind...
- Okay.

569
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,456
- ...I don't know, trying...
- Okay, enough, enough.

570
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,600
Excuse me. I hate to interrupt,
but you're looking a bit shy.

571
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,720
- What's up?
- It's him.

572
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,400
- Let's go for one last dance.
- Not me. Not me.

573
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,680
- Come on, one last dance.
- You go ahead.

574
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,120
Why do you care about
what these people think?

575
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,120
Okay? Polo,
you're not what they think you are.

576
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,200
So now...

577
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,560
you're going to have fun
and have one last dance with us.

578
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,080

STOP STARING AT ME.

You have a thing for going missing, huh?

598
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,160
Samuel.

599
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,360
- What, you don't want to be with me?
- It's not that.

600
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,240

602

Shit.

603
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,640
And here, I thought I'd bagged
the one good guy in class.

604
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,880
I'm really sorry.

605
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,320
Can I stay the night?

606
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,280
Fine.

607
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,040

608

609
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,840
Hey, I'm going to the kitchen
to get a drink.

610
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,840
Okay. There's water in the fridge.

611
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,760
Polo.

612
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,160
We read about...
on Twitter... about...

613
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,280
I'm sorry.

614
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,160
No. <i>We're </i>the ones who are sorry.

615
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,200
We shouldn't have forced you
to go to school.

616
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,360
You were right.

617
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,480
We'll do whatever you say.

618
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,560
Whatever you say.

619
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,480
All I want to do is disappear.

620
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,400
Get far away from here.

621
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,240
Okay, then...

622
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,920
we'll look for a new school... abroad.

623
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,320
We have friends in London, and...

624
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,120
you can finish the school year there,
if you want.

625
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,440
Yes.

626
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,720
You're leaving?

627
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,320
Thank you.

628
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,480
Hm.

629
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,120
Thanks a lot.

630
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,280
Hello.

631
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,200
- You're all set, right?
- What are you doing here?

632
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,000
Nothing.
I just like hospital coffee.

633
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,200
That's a latte.

634
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,680
Thanks.

635
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,600
- Hey! Hey!
- What are you doing here?

636
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,400
Didn't you want to get rid of me?
Well, you just fucked up your chance to!

637
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,680
- What are you talking about?
- I don't want to be here either.

638
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,920
I want out. I was going to leave!

639
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,800
But now I can't get accepted anywhere.

640
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,840
You used a new account
to forward the tweets to every school.

641
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:16,080
- No one wants to be associated with...
- With a fucking murderer.

642
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,760
...with all this fucking shit.

643
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,880
- Are you happy with yourselves?
- No.

644
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,960
- We didn't do it.
- You didn't?

645
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,440
- No.
- Then who did it?

646
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,480
Who?

647
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,440
Cayetana.

648
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,480
