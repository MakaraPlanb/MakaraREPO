There's no way in hell
I'm answering.

11
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,640
I already have a damn Internet
and phone plan.

12
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,160
Rebe.

13
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,280
- What?
- Were you really selling drugs at school?

14
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,360
Is that true, Valerio?

15
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,080
You two, come in.

16
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,040
- Azucena, good morning.
- Good morning, Begoña.

17
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,640
I'd like to talk to you.
Do you have a few minutes?

18
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,480
Um, I'm dealing with an important issue
right now.

19
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,480
It can't be more important than mine.

20
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,520
I'll be right with you.
I'll speak to these two...

21
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,280
I can always bypass you
and speak to the board.

22
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,160
I'm only suggesting meeting with you
out of politeness.

23
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,280
- Just a moment.
- Damn.

24
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,240
I have to go to Ander's house
to get the rest of my stuff.

25
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,560
Then I'll see...

26
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,680
Maybe I'll perform hara-kiri
over my grades.

27
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,960
Were they really that bad?

28
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,680
On a disaster scale:

29
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,600
the Notre-Dame fire,

30
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,520
Spain at Eurovision,

31
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,800
- Madonna at Eurovision...
- Damn.

32
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,840
...my grades.

33
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,880
Ah...

34
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,640
Nah, it's better to just laugh it off.
If I think about it...

35
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,800
in the end, I won't even graduate,
I don't have Ander,

36
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,080
and I'll be out on the street.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,760
What?

38
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,920
Why don't you come to New York with me?

39
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,440
- What?
- Don't be stupid.

40
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,400
You've always wanted to travel

41
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,960
and live somewhere
where you could blend in.

42
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,960
If you can't do that in New York,
I can't think of anywhere else.

43
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,080
- You can look for a job and learn English.
- But what the hell would I do in New York?

44
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,840
Where would I stay?

45
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,520
This is crazy, Nadia.

46
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,160
In my apartment?

47
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah, you showed me photos.
It's as big as Central Park.

48
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,600
Nadia, you can't ask people
you don't know well to...

49
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,920
What do you mean, I don't know him?
We were engaged for one night.

50
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,480
Anyway, you two
certainly know each other well, huh?

51
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,640
Hey, it was just a hookup.

52
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,320
- I meant...
- Yeah, we just hooked up.

53
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,560
You've made that clear.

54
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,520
Staying with you would be
a temporary thing.

55
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,640
Okay, I guess.

56
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,080
If someone hadn't talked,
no one would've found out.

57
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,240
Valerio and Rebeca were selling drugs,
and Polo reported it to administration.

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,040
Are you blaming him
for doing the right thing?

59
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,600
Samuel, Guzmán.

60
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,440
Come with me, please.

61
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,360
Us?

62
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,240
Now.

63
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,520
<i>Let's see, Azucena.</i>

64
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,440
You can make an argument
for expelling Rebe and I.

65
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,896
- But them?
- We didn't do anything!

66
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,960
You were warned.

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,720
I said I wouldn't tolerate
another incident.

68
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,600
And since Christmas break,
you've been making his life hell.

69
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,400
Don't listen to her bullshit.
Polo's mom's behind it.

70
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,120
She was here right before us.
Am I right, Azucena?

71
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,240
The decision has been made.
You are expelled and will not graduate.

72
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,760
- What?
- Samuel!

73
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,800
You're all a bunch of fucking sellouts.

74
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,800
There's no justice here!
All you care about is money and power!

75
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,120
- Don't talk to me like that.
- Or what? You'll expel us?

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,440
Samu, I'm telling you,
it's not worth it.

77
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,800
Samuel, what are you doing?

78
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,880
What's he doing?
What's he doing? Stop!

79
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,696
- What are you doing?
- Relax!

80
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,200
Enough violence already, okay?

81
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,920
- Are you defending him?
- Yes!

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,320
He said
he didn't accuse you two of anything!

83
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,920
And you believe him?

84
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,080
You're doing this so you won't feel bad
about accepting the scholarship.

85
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,800
You'll accept it no matter what,
even if it means taking his side.

86
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,736
<i>♪ I'm gonna miss you being in my head ♪</i>

87
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,760

90
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,760
You want to smash this bottle
over his head as much as I do.

91
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,440
- Admit it.
<i>- ♪ But now I need to go and be away ♪</i>

92

<i>♪ From everything in my head ♪</i>

93
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,040
If they had let me change schools,
this wouldn't have happened.

94
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,760
That doesn't matter now.
We need to think of a way to fix this.

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,760
We could...

96
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,280
It's too late. It's over.

97
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,640
It's not fair
for it to end like this.

98
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,040
Carla almost drowned last night.

99
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,480
- She almost died. It was his fault.
- Sure.

100
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,720
It was <i>my </i>fault!

101
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,320
It was my fucking fault, okay?

102
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,480
What the hell are you talking about now?

103
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,160
I sold her the Molly
after Valerio refused.

104
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,400
Valerio was going to stop dealing
after your little lecture, champ.

105
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,120
What? You didn't know?
Well, now you do.

106
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,120
But, of course,
you couldn't wait to make a scene.

107
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,416
Maybe you couldn't bear
the idea of doing something right

108
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,720
for once in your damn life.

109
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,640
- All right, okay. Go home, Rebeca.
- Fucking Bodyguard Barbie.

110
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,760
Or better yet, just go straight to jail.

111
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,920
- You'll end up there with your mom anyway.
- That's another thing we have in common.

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,280
You get along pretty damn well
with criminals, right?

113
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,000
As long as they pay for your outfits,
expensive dinners, and tuition.

114
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,280
But I get it, okay? I really do.

115
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,960
Hold on to him tight and don't let go.

116
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,280
Because you know
what you'll be left with when he leaves?

117
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,400
Nothing and no one, hon.

118
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,161
Screw this fucking private number.

119
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,200
You don't look bad at all.
At least not at first glance.

120
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,600
- I can't remember a thing.
- That's normal.

121
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,440
No, it's not normal. I lost control.

122
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,080
And I helped you lose it.

123
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,240
- I'm sorry.
- No, you warned me.

124
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,040
I'm the one who's sorry.
I just found out you were expelled.

125
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,080
But... that's what he deserves.

126
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,680
Yesterday wasn't his fault.
He didn't even want to sell it to me.

127
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,760
Sure.

128
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,760
Well, it's the first time
he's had some common sense in ages.

129
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,040
But it was too late.

130
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,800
Well, bye.

131
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,880
Lu, I've been trying to change
for a long time.

132
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,560
<i>Trying </i>to... but you never manage to.

133
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,400
- You're never going to grow up.
- I had nothing to do with it.

134
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,960
You're like a fucking baby...

135
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,240
who's always sticking
his fingers in electrical sockets.

136
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,000
I've been trying to keep you
from electrocuting yourself for 17 years,

137
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,080
but it's never enough.

138
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,440
I can't take it anymore.

139
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,640
Have a nice life.

140
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,520
He always wins.

141
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,520
I swear, I'm fucking sick of this.

142
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,400
We should've moved on a while ago.

143
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,520
- They kicked us out for no reason!
- Not today, not yesterday,

144
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,160
but look at all we did before that
to make his life a living hell.

145
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,120
Not a single day has gone by

146
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
that we haven't put all our energy
into hating him,

147
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,480
and we made sure he knew it.

148
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,760
He didn't win. We lost.

149
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,440
Guzmán.

150
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,800
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

151
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,440
I know you.

152
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,440
What they've done to you is intolerable.

153
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
We deserved it.

154
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,840
What? This can't be the end of it.

155
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,560
- It won't be the end of...
- Stay out of wars that don't concern you.

156
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,240
It concerns me...

157
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,360
especially if it affects someone I love.

158
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,760
Careful. You can't lose your scholarship.
It's your future.

159
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,360
What about yours? Doesn't it matter?

160
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,720
I'm 17 years old.

161
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,040
I can afford
to put my future on hold for a year.

162
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
Hey.

163
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,720
After the graduation ceremony,
we're gonna party,

164
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,760
and we're gonna have a blast.
Nothing will fuck it up.

165
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,120
I promise.

166
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,880
Give me a light, honey.

167
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,040
You never smoke on the job.

168
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,960
Those kids will be the end of me.

169
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,160
The school year's almost over,
but they'll be the end of me.

170
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,040
What you've done is massively unfair.
You know that, don't you?

171
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,520
- No, please. Not you too.
- What do you want me to say?

172
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,400
This isn't about fair or unfair, Ander.

173
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,000
It's much more complicated than that.
You'd have to be in my shoes to know.

174
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,880
But Guzmán and Samu didn't deserve it.

175
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,360
Just focus on the important stuff.

176
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,200
- On your exams, for example.
- I'm not going to do makeup exams.

177
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,440
Please don't start saying
you don't want any favoritism.

178
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,040
There is no favoritism in retaking exams
due to your medical treatment.

179
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,160
I'm not going to waste my final days
in front of a book, Mom.

180
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,120
What do you mean, final days?

181
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,840
There's no hope for me.
Not in the long term or the near future,

182
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,880
- and...
- Where did you get that idea, Ander?

183
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,080
Who told you that? No one told me that.

184
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,920
This is all I have.

185
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
The present.

186
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,520
But, honey...

187
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,880
Okay, and maybe tomorrow, too.

188
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,640
But I won't waste my time studying.
What for?

189
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,000
And I won't tolerate
this defeatist attitude.

190
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,400
Mom...

191
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,880
You don't want to study?
What do you want to do, then?

192
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,480
I don't know.

193
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,520
I want to spend some time by myself.

194
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,000
Start getting ready.

195
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,680
You'd have to be
in my shoes to understand.

196
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,120
HI, YERAY. WHEN CAN WE MEET?

197
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,040
YERAY, PLEASE, ANSWER ME.

198
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,040
ARE YOU OK? CAN I CALL YOU?

199
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,200
FROM: MOM
SUBJECT: GOOD NEWS!!!

200
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,720
The lawyer wants to meet
my mother and my brother in Morocco.

201
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,600
- He says he has good news.
- That's fucking awesome.

202
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,040
Imagine, maybe this nightmare is over,
and your brother can come home.

203
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,720
No, none of this will be over
as long as Polo's free.

204
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,640
Man, you're obsessed with Polo.
Forget about him already, will you?

205
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,800
Hasn't he fucked up your school year,
your life, and everything enough?

206
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,720
- How can I forget?
- Distance yourself.

207
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,160
Focus on what matters. What matters now
is your family coming home.

208
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,760
- Do what Guzmán's done: move on.
- What are you talking about?

209
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,840
Here.

210
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,000
- What are you doing?
- Close your eyes. Go on, close them.

211
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,040
Done.

212
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,000
- What's done?
- Polo no longer exists.

213
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,320
Polo who? I don't know any Polo.

214
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,280
- Hey, neither do I.
- See?

215
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,736
- Hey, it really works.
- Mm.

216
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,400
Can I have a napkin?

217
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,000
I can't believe
you had the balls to show up here.

218
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,080
I just want to dry off, Omar.

219
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,480
And I just want you to leave.
I'm saying this for your own good.

220
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,880
Leave!

221
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,560
- Mom!
- Baby, tell me you have a cig.

222
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,560
I'm jonesing for one so bad,
I almost smoked parsley.

223
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
So?

224
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,840
Aren't you going to give your mom a hug?

225
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,240
That's more like it.

226
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,520
Please tell me you have my lighter.

227
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,680
Why didn't you say
you were getting out today?

228
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,000
I called you a few times this morning,
but you didn't pick up.

229
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,560
- Shit, that was you?
- Of course it was me.

230
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,920
You smell so nice.

231
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,320
And you look great.

232
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,560
What?

233
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,160
- It's nothing.
- Come on, baby, I know that look.

234
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,920
I got kicked out of school.

235
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,320
What are you talking about?

236
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,560
- When?
- Now. I mean, a little while ago.

237
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,920
- And what for?
- What do you think?

238
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,600
God damn it.

239
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,000
Well, know what? Fuck school.

240
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,800
He who can, does;
he who cannot, studies. Hm?

241
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,920
And you've been doing an awesome job
running the family business.

242
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,880
At your own level,
a small-scale operation,

243
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,400
but awesome just the same.

244
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,680
So from now on, it's the two of us,

245
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,200
mother and daughter,
working hand in hand.

246
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Hello.

247
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,120
Holy shit, Mom.

248
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,440
You can get mad at her later.
Shall we step outside?

249
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,560
Sorry, Ander. I didn't know what to do.

250
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,680
<i>Why's it so hard to understand?</i>

251
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,320
We do understand.

252
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,120
Look at you. You got expelled.
So what?

253
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,680
It's no big deal.

254
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,080
You will graduate next year.
I don't fucking have next year.

255
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,600
- What is so difficult to understand?
- Fine, you don't have next year.

256
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,840
What do you want to do?

257
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,240
Your mom says that you want time alone.
That's a shitty plan.

258
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,080
Guzmán, you guys will never understand me.

259
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,080
I'm fine with you doing
whatever the hell you want.

260
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,040
If you don't want to study, then don't.

261
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,120
Do whatever.
Go skydiving, if that's what you want.

262
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,680
Just don't isolate yourself, please,

263
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,440
because if you're really dying, I don't...

264
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,400
I don't buy that you want to spend
your last days alone.

265
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,560
Without your family, your friends,
and Omar.

266
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,040
Ander. Ander!

267
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,000
- God damn it, Ander.
- Leave me alone, please.

268
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,680
I can't take it anymore.

269
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,960
<i>Uh, hi, Polo.
I know you don't want to talk.</i>

270
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,600
<i>That's okay, but I'm just asking you,
please, please... talk to your moms.</i>

271
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,120
<i>They could get them to readmit Valerio
and forgive him</i>

272
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,600
<i>because there's no sense in punishing him
when he had already learned his lesson.</i>

273
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,680
<i>Okay?</i>

274
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,680
<i>Please, whatever you decide, call me.</i>

275
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,280
<i>Please, okay?</i>

276
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,000
What are you wearing tomorrow?

277
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,120
I'm not going, Mom.

278
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,840
The only ones
who aren't graduating...

279
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,080
deserved to be expelled.

280
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,040
What about Guzmán and Samuel?
They just wanted to break up the fight.

281
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,280
Yeah, those bullies
have been making your life

282
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,560
a living hell all year.

283
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,640
If you're not man enough
to face up to them,

284
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,360
you can't expect me to sit back
and watch them torture my son.

285
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,360
How about the striped shirt...

286
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,280
with the blue pants?

287
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,840
You'll look fabulous.

288
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,560
What are you doing here?

289
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,400
What's up with you?

290
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,560
How'd you get in?

291
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,240
There's nobody at the door
for you to manipulate.

292
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,120
From when you asked me
to decorate the place and make it my own.

293
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,000
I see...

294
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,800
Those were good times.

295
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,240
Please, take a seat.
Make yourself comfortable.

296
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,920
Why are you here, Carla?

297
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,680
I came to apologize.

298
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,200
For real.

299
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,920
- You're a great guy.
- Hm.

300
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,520
"Yeray, you're a great guy.
You're really worth it.

301
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,920
Any girl would kill to be with you."

302
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,440
Any girl except the one who says it,
of course. Been there.

303
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,880
I really mean it.

304
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,640
Carla, the last thing I need now
is your pity, really.

305
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,640
- Please go.
- All right, all right.

306
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,680
Let's stop playing the victim...

307
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,360
because you don't like me either.

308
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,280
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

309
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,800
I don't like you,
and you don't like me either.

310
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,080
Uh-huh.
And what about these last few months?

311
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,440
- What do you call that?
- You love what I represent.

312
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,720
How well I fit in
with the image you created

313
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,240
to get likes from the people
who made fun of you

314
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,120
when you were the old Yeray.

315
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,360
Your body, your clothes, your attitude...

316
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,080
You've created your own social network
to get them to worship you.

317
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,560
To you, I'm just another accessory.

318
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,336
And you see me as a walking checkbook
who can save your damn wineries, right?

319
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,920
Like I was saying,

320
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,880
we don't like each other
the way we pretended to.

321
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,600
Even so, I was lucky enough
to get to know the real Yeray,

322
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,240
the guy behind the selfies.

323
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,200
And let me tell you something,
he's an awesome guy.

324
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,120
Much better than the one you made up.

325
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,920
And I bet any girl would kill
to be with you.

326
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,400
Any girl but me.

327
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,120
So... screw the likes...

328
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,440
and screw the wineries.

329
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,320
We've already wasted enough of our lives
doing what others want us to do, right?

330
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,680
You don't need to prove anything
to anyone.

331
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,920
Now... can I give you a hug?

332
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,840
Just as a friend.
No manipulation involved.

333
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,040
- Are you nervous, honey?
- Yeah, a little, Dad.

334
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,880
- It'll be okay.
- Look, it's Omar.

335
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,160
- How are you, Mom?
- I'm fine.

336
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,480
You look great.

337
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,160
You too.

338
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,120
- How are you?
- A little nervous.

339
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,560
- Nervous about what? Get out!
- Hi there.

340
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,040
- Hi.
- Hi, Lu.

341
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,440
You look hot.

342
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,440
I like it.

343
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,000
Hey, Lu?

344
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,080
What's up?

345
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,600
Aren't your parents coming?

346
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,360
It seems that <i>your </i>family
can put problems aside for a while

347
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,480
and focus on what really matters.

348
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,360
I envy you...

349
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,240
in a good way...

350
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,720
and in a bad way.
You look like a pistachio.

351
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,680
Was it really that serious?
Can't you be reasonable?

352
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,480
- After all I've done for this damn school!
- Oh, please!

353
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,640
Look, I'm taking you to court.
That's what I'll do.

354
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,280
Uh... Please go inside.

355
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,200
Ventura, do what you think is best,
but the expulsion is more than justified.

356
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,320
Justified?

357
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,960
On the last day of the school year?
Oh, please!

358
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,560
My son's entire year
was thrown in the trash on the last day!

359
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,840
- Laura, Ventura, I think...
- Lucrecia, honey, stay out of this.

360
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,480
Actually, I wish you had done more
to help Guzmán.

361
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,880
Me?

362
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,520
Yes.
Your father is very influential.

363
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,440
- If everyone makes a little effort...
- Okay, that's enough.

364
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,200
I'm very sorry.

365
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,240
Polo.

366
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,080
Hi, how are you?

367
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,200
So? Why have you been ignoring me?

368
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,400
They haven't done the paperwork yet.

369
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,240
- We'll just talk to your moms...
- Cayetana.

370
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,560
Why are you
so hell-bent on Valerio graduating?

371
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,160
- So he can come with us and...
- And save our relationship.

372
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,560
Because without him,
it... just doesn't work, right?

373
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,880
Polo, don't start.

374
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,000
Don't start.

375
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,440
I get it. You're under a lot of pressure.

376
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,480
- You don't know what you're saying.
- No.

377
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,160
For the first time in a long time,
I know exactly what I'm saying.

378
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,120
I'm sorry.

379
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,000
Okay. What about London?
What about our plans?

380
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,720
Don't you see?
That's all you're worried about.

381
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,120
London, our plans...

382
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,840
- So?
- You're not in love with me.

383
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,040
You're in love with the life
I was going to give you.

384
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,640
Why are you using the past tense?

385
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,680
I'm sorry.

386
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,560
I have to go, okay?

387
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,080
Hey, what happened?

388
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,560
Nothing.

389
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,640
Uh... can you give me a second?

390
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,200
It... It won't take long.

391
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,680
Teodoro.

392
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,080
Can we meet at your place later
so we can close the deal?

393
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:13,000
Uh, sure.
I'm glad you reconsidered.

394
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,240
<i>The ceremony will start in five minutes.</i>

395
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,920
There he is.

396
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,640
Thanks.
Let's continue with the ceremony.

397
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,480
Shit...

398
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,680
Let me do it.

399
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,040
<i>The students
I'm about to introduce...</i>

400
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,520
What should we do?

401
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,800
I really don't know.

402
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,080
All I know is I want that scholarship,
Nadia.

403
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,560
So do I. But we're selling out, Lu.

404
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,720
You don't want it, then?

405
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,800
At what cost? Hm?

406
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,000
<i>I'd like to invite the winners
of the scholarship to the stage.</i>

407
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,400
<i>A big round of applause, please,</i>

408
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,680
for Nadia Shanaa
and Lucrecia Montesinos Hendrich.

409
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:43,000
Bill McKinley will present the award
on behalf of Columbia University.

410
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,600
Hi, everyone.

411
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,920
Thank you for having me.
I'm very excited to be here.

412
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,360
Congratulations.
We're excited to have you at Columbia.

413
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,800
Thank you.

414
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,040
Good afternoon.

415
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:20,120
Thank you to our parents and friends
who have joined us

416
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,040
for such a special moment...

417
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,480
for us and... for our fellow students.

418
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,160
I would like to...

419
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,840
I can't do this.

420
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,080
- Can you speak for me, please, Nadia?
- Go on. You've already started.

421
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,760
Well...

422
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,800
- I was saying that...
- No, wait.

423
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,600
I would just like to say that...

424
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,800
I would like to... well,

425
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,320
<i>we</i> would like to...

426
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,800
I think
I'm speaking on behalf of both of us...

427
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,360
dedicate this award

428
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,040
to all our fellow students,

429
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,920
especially everyone there in the back,

430
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,720
who, for different reasons,
cannot join us up here...

431
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,320
as part of this graduation ceremony.

432
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,640
Not being able to have them
here with us...

433
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,400
...makes this moment...

434
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,480
not as happy
as we would have liked it to be.

435
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
That's true.

436
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,640
Because she and I
should be jumping for joy...

437
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,720
but we're not.

438
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,240
Because we... deserve this award.

439
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,560
We deserve this moment, Nadia.

440
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,760
My friends are there...

441
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,880
due to a series of injustices...

442
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:18,360
the most serious of all being the one
that deprived us of having...

443
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,680
Marina with us.

444
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,160
Injustices...

445
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,280
that we both condemn.

446
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,440
That's right.

447
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,680
And just one person is responsible
for all of those injustices.

448
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,640
Polo.

449
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,840
- How are you? Happy with yourself?
- I can't believe it.

450
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,680
Look, the award we are receiving...

451
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,000
was a ploy your moms came up with
to clean up your image, basically.

452
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,240
And we are accepting it
because, I repeat, we deserve it.

453
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,760
What should we do?
Because this has become...

454
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,360
If it's such a problem for you
to accept the award, don't worry.

455
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,560
The scholarship has been called off.

456
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,680
- Please.
- No.

457
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,760
All we've ever wanted
is to support Las Encinas

458
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,280
and to help the students.

459
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,760
Who entered the restroom?

460
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,800
Omar, I don't have all day.

461
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,560
And even if I did,
I don't have the patience. Give me a name.

462
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,680
Nadia.

463
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,520
Are you accusing your own sister?

464
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,960
You know what?
I promised someone I love dearly

465
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,680
that we would celebrate this day together.

466
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:56,480
That we would have lots of fun
and that nothing would fuck it up.

467
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,440
Let's go celebrate at Teatro Barceló!

468
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,360
- Hello?
<i>- Samuel.</i>

469
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,680
You need to come to the police station.
It's extremely urgent.

470
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,640
Dad, I'm going to the restroom.

471
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,160
- Wait for me outside.
- Okay.

472
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,680
- We don't have the money.
- We'll take out a loan.

473
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,120
So?

474
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,640
You don't need Nadia to go to New York.

475
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,000
What do you mean?

476
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,560
- I'm not going on my own.
- You'll have me.

477
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,600
Wow! I thought we were just hooking up.

478
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,680
Shit.

479
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,080
- What?
- I'm sorry.

480
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,360
Sorry I didn't react
the way you wanted me to.

481
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,880
And, yes, we were just hooking up...
but it meant a lot to me.

482
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,760
When your sister asked me
if you could come with me,

483
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,960
it left me speechless.

484
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,840
I also thought Nadia's idea was crazy.

485
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,840
And they were more than hookups
for me too.

486
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,240
Maybe that's
why we should go ahead with it.

487
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,840
If a suggestion leaves you speechless,
then you have to do it. Hm?

488
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,960
It was all a trap...

489
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,640
so they could find your family
and arrest your brother.

490
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,000
I'm sorry.

491
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,360
I swear I knew nothing about it.

492
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,840
They tricked me too. I swear.

493
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,400
And did they find them?

494
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,440
Your brother is awaiting extradition.

495
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Oh, Samuel...

496
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,000
Meanwhile, the killer is about to go free,
dressed in his suit and tie.

497
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,640
- I'm sorry.
- You should be. It's your fault.

498
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,080
- I told you they deceived me too.
- Who did?

499
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,680
Who deceived you? Huh?

500
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,120
I'll tell you.
Your bosses, your colleagues.

501
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,480
The fucking system you work for,
belong to,

502
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,360
and that you won't do
a damn thing against.

503
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,800
That's why it's your fault.

504
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,720
Shit.

505
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,600
I printed the document
you sent me.

506
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,000
If you want to review it one last time...

507
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,440
Hmm, no.

508
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,920
Uh, no, I think <i>you </i>should review it.

509
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,760
Yes.

510
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,720
There was a change made
to section three of clause four.

511
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,920
- About the management of the wineries?
- Mm-hmm.

512
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,520
We replaced your name with Carla's.

513
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,680
She will be the sole and exclusive manager
of the wineries and all related assets.

514
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,360
As soon as she turns 18,
which won't be long now.

515
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,880
Let's see...

516
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,680
You won't be involved in the business.

517
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,560
Neither will I.
I'll remain on the sidelines,

518
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,480
so... Carla will be the owner
and the one in charge.

519
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,560
Yeray, what you are proposing
has never been on the table.

520
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,200
Well, it is now.

521
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,120
You choose:

522
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,680
let your daughter
support you as she sees fit,

523
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,360
or let your business go under,

524
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,680
so you'll have no way
of supporting yourself.

525
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,200
She is very young and has no damn clue
how all this works.

526
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,920
Say something, honey.

527
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,520
I say... I'm done taking orders from you.

528
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,080
- Excuse me?
- I say...

529
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,360
that you aren't going to decide
what I can and can't do anymore.

530
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,000
That's over.

531
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,920
I want to do whatever I want,

532
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,840
be whatever I want,
and be with whoever I want.

533
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,960
You have no power over me anymore.

534
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,200
So? Shall we sign?

535
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,920
You know who's to blame? Azucena.

536
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,280
She doesn't command any respect
from the students.

537
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,040
She's afraid of them,
and she's too lax.

538
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,560
It was just a childish prank.
Canceling the scholarship is too much.

539
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,240
At least I did something.

540
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,320
If it wasn't for me,

541
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,800
those two bullies
who've made your son's life hell

542
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,160
would still be there.

543
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,160
- Maybe I deserved it.
- What are you talking about?

544
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,640
Don't be ridiculous, Polo.

545
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,440
With everything
that's happened this year...

546
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,120
The bullying, the tweets,

547
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,040
everything they wrote,
the hurt they've caused.

548
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,360
And on top of that,
the person who's supposed to deal...

549
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,640
I killed Marina, Mom!

550
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,760
- It was an accident, but I killed her.
- Enough of this nonsense.

551
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,520
- Begoña!
- I don't want to hear it.

552
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,920
Marina had something
that belonged to Carla...

553
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,880
...and I took it to win Carla back.

554
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,720
- Polo, shut up.
- No!

555
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,440
For fuck's sake, Mom.
Don't you always tell me to be a man?

556
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,040
To face up to things, to be brave?

557
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,240
Well, that's what I'm doing.

558
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,000
I killed Marina.

559
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,000
And I can't bring her back.

560
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,360
And I can't make it
so that Samuel and Guzmán can graduate.

561
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,080
But don't cancel the scholarship.

562
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,160
At least let someone
have a happy ending in this shitty story.

563
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,520
Call now, please.

564
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,840
Please.

565
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,800
Azucena? Hello. Yes, it's Begoña.

566
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,800
I'm sorry about calling so late, but...

567
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,240

about the scholarship...

Let me ask you a question
you once asked me.

587
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,520
Where does this leave us?

588
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,520
What's "this"?

589
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,040
The fact that I'm not going.
That I'm staying.

590
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,720
Well, taking inspiration
from the answer you gave me...

591
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,080
I'd say it leaves us
in exactly the same place.

592
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,000

- No.

622
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,520
I got an opportunity to go to New York.

623
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,120
Really?

624
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,960
Yes.

625
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,000
But not with your sister, right?

626
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,400
No. I mean, yes.

627
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,400

but after what happened,
