supporting you.

Cayetana, it's my decision. It's my life.

26
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,960
- I'm tired of everyone deciding for me.
- When have I ever done that? Huh?

27
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,920
Did you contact the British school
so they wouldn't accept me?

28

31
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,200
It had to have been you.

32
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,600
I did it
because I didn't want to lose you.

33
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,480
Because I love you. All right?

34
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,160
You want me by your side,
knowing my life here is hell.

35
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,360
- That isn't love.
- Hi!

36
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,360

Everything okay?

37
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,480

38
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,040
Yesterday, I still thought this
was like a horror movie.

39
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,400
Two monsters fighting
over a damsel in distress.

40
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,480
Now she's in tears
over two monsters who aren't worth it.

41
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,920
And a son of a bitch who came
to fuck up our lives. Right, Polo?

42
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,840
Maybe the monster
isn't who you think, right?

43
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,416

I sold you the Molly

I did it knowing that you weren't okay

I was jealous too.

You? Why?

67
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,240
He was with me,
but all he did was think of you.

68
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,120
Yeah. And I was with someone else,
but all I did was think about him.

00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,080
Let me do it. It's my job.

170
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,000
What else now?

171
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,080
You have to be kidding me.
Shit, Polo...

172
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,880
Can't you wait one night for him
to be gone?

173
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,720
Are you still defending him?

174
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,960
Clean this up, talk later. Come on!

175
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,760
Look for the neck of the bottle.

176
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,840
Get out of here, Polo.

177
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,320
You think I don't realize I'm not welcome?

178
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,640
Do you think I need you
to tell me that every day?

179
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,640
Anyway,
what the fuck did I ever do to you, Lu?

180
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,040
Huh?

181
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
Nothing.

182
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,720
What about to Carla?

183
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,200
And Ander?

184
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,520
Guzmán...

185
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,640
You don't know
how much you're hurting him.

186
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,520
You have no fucking clue

187
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,880
how much it tortures him
that you're still alive.

188
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,680
That you're breathing the same air as us.

189
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,480
Mark my words, Polo,

190
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,640
I'll always protect the people I love.

191
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,000
Guzmán...

192
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,360
doesn't love you...

193
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Lu.

194
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,960
Stop groveling for once
in your fucking life.

195
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,840
But you're an expert at groveling,
aren't you?

196
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,000
You are.

197
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,240
Until they leave you
for someone better, right?

198
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,000
At least Carla loved me at one point.
But has anyone ever loved you, Lu?

199
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,920
Did you think that by being
the most stylish,

200
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,240
the richest, and at the top of the class,
everyone would love you?

201
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,480
- Shut up.
- But nobody loves you.

202
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,440
- They envy you...
- Shut up.

203
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,880
...fear you, despise you...

204
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,000
That's why they don't love you.
And that's why you're alone.

205
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,840
Shut up.

206
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,000
Polo?

207
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,280
Polo?

208
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,840
No, I didn't...
Polo, I didn't mean to...

209
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,440
I know.

210
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,320
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

211
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,160
- Sorry.
- I know.

212
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,120
Forgive me.

213
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,440
Polo...

214
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,320
Forgive me.

215
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:24,160

Polo!

222
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
Polo!

223
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,560
Polo.

224
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,880
Call an ambulance, please!
Call an ambulance!

225
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,800
Polo.

226
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,160
Polo.

227
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,600
I forgive you.

228
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,360
I forgive you.

229
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,040
Don't worry.

230
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,120
Don't worry.

231
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,920
Careful!

232
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,400
- Move aside.
- Stay away.

233
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,840
- Come on.
- Polo! Polo!

234
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,920
- Please!
- The police are on their way!

235
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,840
Calm down.

236
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,960
I-I didn't mean to. I didn't.

237
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,600
It was an accident, Lu.

238
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,120
- It was my fault.
- No.

239
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,560
- We'll tell them it was an accident.
- Nobody will believe that.

240
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,520
Everyone saw her throw a drink
in his face.

241
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,040
- But it's true.
- The cops don't want the truth.

242
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,680
They want to close the case
as soon as possible,

243
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,280
find someone to blame,
and lock them up for 20 or 30 years.

244
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,640
We have no choice.

245
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,240
Yes, we do.

246
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,880
We can put an end to this nightmare
once and for all.

247
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,080
We've all suffered enough.

248
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,120
Too many lives have been destroyed.

249
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,440
We will walk out of here,
together and free.

250
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,920
And we'll leave this shit behind forever.

251
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,000
Her fingerprints are on the bottle.

252
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,760
We could break it.

253
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,880
Not here. The noise would give us away.

254
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,720
Are you serious?

255
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,400
What if there are other fingerprints
on it?

256
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,680
What if they found
all of our fingerprints on it?

257
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,360
It would be the same as not finding any.

258
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,040
Polo did something horrible,

259
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,760
but he wasn't a murderer.
And neither are you, Lu.

260
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,280
He wouldn't want you to waste your life
paying for one mistake.

261
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,560
Nadia.

262
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,880
You're risking the scholarship
in New York.

263
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,840
What?

264
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,800
Before coming,
Polo convinced his moms not to cancel it.

265
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,440
Fuck.

266
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,800
If we're going to New York...

267
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,520
we're going together.

268
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,560
Have we all touched it?

269
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,200
All but one of us. The most important one.

270
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,640
We can try to make it look like a suicide.

271
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,600
How will we do that?

272
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,920
Where are you going?

273
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,120
Stay away from him, come on.

274
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,840
Hey, she's his widow, damn it.

275
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,640
Won't you let his girlfriend say goodbye
before they wrap him up like a sausage?

276
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,720
Shit, have a little decency.

277
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,040
Go on, then.

278
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,480
Come on.

279
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,960
Come on.

280
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,800
Hey, thanks a lot. Okay?

281
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,560
I really loved you.

282
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,960
So much.

283
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,680
If only I could have loved you better.

284
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,440
I'm sorry.

285
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,560
I'm sorry.

286
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,480
Cayetana.

287
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,880
Cayetana!

288
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,720
For fuck's sake, Cayetana.

289
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,640
Come on, Cayetana.
Cayetana, that's enough. That's enough.

290
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,200
Let go of the bottle. Let's go. Let's go.

291
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,400
Don't let anyone touch the body!

292
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,640
My God.

293
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,120
It's done.

294
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,160
- What will they do now?
- Question all of us, one by one...

295
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,120
which isn't a problem,
because no one saw anything.

296
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,240
Agreed?

297
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,760
Someone saw me.

298
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,640
What?

299
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,840
Yeah, when I went to pick up
the neck of the bottle...

300
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,000
I bumped into a group of...

301
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,960
girls, I think.

302
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,160
Shit, no fucking...

303
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,640
Did anyone see you go into the restroom
with the neck of the bottle?

304
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,200
Yes.

305
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,800
Shh. It's okay. It's okay. Hey.

306
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,920
I need you to remember
who they were, okay?

307
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,800
It's important we talk to them.
Who are they?

308
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,320
- I can't remember, Valerio.
- Shit.

309
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,560
- What if those girls talk?
- Do you have a better idea?

310
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,800
I hated him.

311
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,840
I blamed him for my illness.

312
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,120
I lost control. I stabbed him in the heart
with the broken glass.

313
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,200
- You're nuts. Why would you confess?
- What does it matter?

314
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,280
I'm as good as dead.

315
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,696
What difference is it to me if I die
in the hospital or in jail?

316
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,720
No fucking way.

317
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,400
I won't let you sacrifice yourself
to protect someone, okay?

318
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,240
Who's sacrificing himself?

319
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,120
We need a decoy
to throw the cops off track.

320
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,920
Not just one.

321
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,920
We need a lot of decoys.

322
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,200
It's important that you tell us
everything you've seen,

323
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,560
anything you think might be useful.

324
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,360
Everything. Any detail could be key.

325
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,200
Guzmán.

326
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,240
Wait, so are you saying
we should all accuse each other?

327
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,560
That's right.

328
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,240
If witnesses saw Lu go into the restroom
with the bottle, it's over.

329
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:25,480
But if they also have witnesses
who saw me, Samuel, or Valerio go in...

330
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,640
- Those statements will be worthless.
- Exactly.

331
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,480
Now, the question is...
who will accuse who?

332
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,320
It was Samu.

333
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,000
I saw him go into the restroom
with a broken bottle.

334
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,320
I didn't do it.

335
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,560
But if I knew who did,
I wouldn't tell you.

336
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,760
- That means you know who did it.
- That means I'd never tell you.

337
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,400
Although, maybe...

338
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,960
I saw Valerio going in just after Polo.

339
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,480
Are you sure?

340
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,960
Absolutely.

341
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,520
Cayetana was jealous of my relationship
with Polo.

342
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,720
As soon as I saw her follow him,
I knew what would happen.

343
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,280
What time was that?

344
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,000
At 12:30.

345
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,000
A quarter to one, yeah.

346
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,960
I know because that's the time
I take my allergy tablet.

347
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,560
I was going to the restroom,
but I saw Polo.

348
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,720
I thought I'd better not go in...
because I didn't want to bump into him.

349
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,960
And that's when I saw someone
go into the restroom right after him,

350
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,920
carrying a glass object.

351
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,240
Who did you see?

352
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,400
I just feel so bad because...

353
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,600
- And with all that's going on with him...
- Cayetana, who did you see?

354
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,560
Ander.

355
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,160
Guzmán.

356
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,720
He bent down,
picked up the neck of the bottle,

357
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,040
and entered the restroom.

358
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,760
You saw him?

359
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,720
With your own eyes? You saw Guzmán?

360
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,360
Omar.

361
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,360
Nadia. That's all I know. Can I go?

362
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,360
- Carla.
- Rebeca.

363
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,040
I didn't see anything at all.

364
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,880
Hey. You did the right thing.

365
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,120
Hey.

366
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,880
You did what you had to do.

367
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,320
Nothing will happen to Guzmán.

368
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,720
Or to any of us.

369
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,440
Omar, Polo's dead.

370
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,080
I've been talking about death for months.

371
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,640
The more I talked about it,
the less I feared it.

372
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,720
But now that I've seen it...

373
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,440
I'm scared shitless.

374
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,360
What can I do for you?

375
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,400
What do you want? What do you need?

376
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,360
I need you.

377
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,120
What about the guy you were with?

378
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,560
That was nothing.

379
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,360
What do you mean?

380
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,720
I made it all up.

381
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,920
I did it to push you away. I'm sorry.

382
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,680
If you wanted to get rid of me,
congratulations.

383
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
You did it.

384
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,160
Omar...

385
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,280
Lucrecia, your turn.

386
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,640
Your turn.

387
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,440
I can't do it, Nadia.

388
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,720
You have to lie.
Tell them you saw someone else go in.

389
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,560
It doesn't matter who it is.

390
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,040
Do you remember when Dad asked you
who had messed up the car,

391
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,320
who stained the carpet,
or who dyed the dog pink?

392
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,040
I need you to make up one more story.

393
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,960
Lu, I need you to lie.

394
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,840
But this time, it's not for me.
It's for you.

395
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,080
Please.

396
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,200
Several witnesses have told us
they saw you arguing with Polo.

397
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,880
Did you throw a drink in his face?

398
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,600
Yes.

399
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,760
And at least two people saw you
go into the restroom

400
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,000
with the neck of the bottle in your hand.

401
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,440
Was it you?

402
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,920
Did you kill him?

403
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,360
No.

404
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,760
We know each other better
than either of us would like to, Lucrecia.

405
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,400
And I think you're lying to me.

406
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,280
Tell me the truth.

407
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,280
Why are you so shaken up? What's wrong?

408
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,560
I'm shaken up because I saw who did it.

409
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,200
Who?

410
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,440
I don't know. I-I don't...

411
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:20,000
What happened tonight?
I've never seen you like this before.

412
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,920
And I don't believe
you're this upset over Polo's death.

413
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,000
You weren't even really friends.

414
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,040
What do you know?

415
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,480
Polo <i>was </i>my friend.

416
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,320
Despite everything...

417
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,280
...we are all friends.

418
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,200
More like a family.

419
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,280
We might not say
we love each other every day...

420
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,840
but you have no fucking clue
what I've been through with these people.

421
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,080
Year after year...

422
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,160
...and we have a lot of years
in front of us!

423
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,720
I'm shaken up...

424
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,160
because it hurts my soul...

425
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:24,720
...that the best people
I've ever known...

426
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,120
have to go through this shit again...

427
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,480
like with Marina.

428
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,440
They don't deserve it.

429
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,000
So...

430
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,760
If I'm crying,
if my voice breaks...

431
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,600
and I don't know what to do,
it's because...

432
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,120
...I have feelings, bitch.

433
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,520
But I didn't do it.

to study abroad.

Alone?

449
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,760
That's the idea.

450
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,040
Can people come visit?

451
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,960
That depends.

452
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,080

It's a pleasure
doing business with you again.

465
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,400
You know I've been away for a while,
but I'm back now.

466
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,840
Good morning.

467
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,640
How are you, baby?

468
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,800
I'm tired.

469
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:54,160
What is it? Too much partying, huh?
Go on, go to bed and get some rest.

470
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,280
No, Mom. No.

471
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,320
I'm tired of dead bodies...

472
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,760
police, and threats...

473
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,880
I can't do this anymore.

474
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,840
All I'm asking for is a boring life.

475
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,280
Come on, babe.

476
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,480
And all I'm asking you
is to quit this shit.

477
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,880
Please.

478
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,920
Tell them to leave.

479
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,960
Because if you don't,
I'll be the one who ends up leaving.

480
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,280
Inspector.

481
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,320
An anonymous call

482
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,560
warned us of the presence
of a suspicious box in a park,

483
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,400
about 100 meters away from the station.

484
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,520
I called you down here because if we find
Polo's prints on the trophy,

485
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,320
we'll have to reopen the investigation.

486
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,080
I know this must be a difficult time
for you.

487
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,160
He did it.

488
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,720
He confessed to us
just before he...

489
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,840
...that night.

490
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,720
Your brother is free.

491
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,560
He can come back anytime.

492
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,200
He's not coming back.

493
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,360
He doesn't trust you.

494
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,560
And neither do I.

495
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,560
I don't believe
you've been honest with me either.

496
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,560
What happened that night at the club,
Samuel?

497
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,440
What wouldn't have happened
if you'd done your job.

498
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,240
I'm sorry.

499
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,480
I'm really sorry, Samuel.

500
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,720
Would you like a beer?

501
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,400
Yes.

502
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,560
Did the police really buy
the suicide story?

503
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,160
At least the guilty party
can't contest it.

504
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,680
Carla.

505
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,560
Can we talk for a moment?

506
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,320
- Sure, I'll leave you to it.
- No. With you, Cayetana.

507
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,840
Sure.

508
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,720
You can go to Oxford, Columbia, Harvard...
whichever university you want.

509
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,280
We'll pay for it.

510
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,320
- And for your housing too.
- No, but... seriously...

511
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,240
It's what Polo would have wanted.

512
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,400
You were the only one
who always stood by him.

513
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,760
We didn't know how to do that.

514
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,920
You deserve it.

515
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,760
No. I don't deserve it.

516
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,280
Anyway, public universities are great.

517
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,800
Seriously. And I think...

518
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,240
...it's time I accept
that my resources are limited,

519
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,000
that I come from
the kind of family I come from,

520
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,040
and that my last name is what it is.

521
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,720
Still, I can achieve
whatever I put my mind to, right?

522
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,800
Of course you can.
Of course you can.

523
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,600
Carla, I suppose you know

524
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,440
that you can't leave to study abroad.
You're responsible for the wineries.

525
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,440
I'll have a trusted contact here
who will report to me.

526
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,720
You'll be working closely together.

527
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,440
Who?

528
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,480
Valerio.

529
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,040
I don't know if you know Valerio.
This is my dad.

530
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,600
Nice to meet you.

531
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,840
Yes, your reputation precedes you.

532
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,880
I assure you, the reality's much worse
than whatever you've heard.

533
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,440
I heard you didn't even graduate.

534
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,440
And yet, I ran my own
highly successful business.

535
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,360
Yes, an illegal business.

536
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,720
Since when are you scared
of breaking the law, Teodoro?

537
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,560
Relax, I'll mostly be taking care of PR.

538
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,440
I'm the best at getting people to party.

539
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,200
Do you think
this is what the wineries need?

540
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,360
Valerio is a good person.

541
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,760
And we really need that.

542
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,280
- Carla, I hope this is all a joke...
- Let me tell you about my plan.

543
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,960
I think social media
will be crucial for marketing.

544
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,600
If we want to sell,
this is going to be key...

545
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,520
Nadia, hurry up!

546
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,040
Do you have the passports
and tickets?

547
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,680
- Yes.
- Aren't you going to check that bag?

548
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,120
- No, I'll take it on the plane with me.
- Are you bringing winter clothes?

549
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,120
Yes.

550
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,360
- It's cold there.
- I know, Dad.

551
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,480
Don't worry. I'll call when we get there.

552
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,040
Good.

553
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,960
Omar...

554
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,840
...I'm sorry about that boy.

555
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,880
What boy, Dad?

556
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,760
Your friend. Your boyfriend.

557
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,880
I'm really sorry.

558
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,760
Guzmán won't make it on time.

559
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,600
Why not?

560
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,080
He's with Ander.

561
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:49,320
He's getting the results
of the latest round of chemo.

562
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,480
We'll hear how it went
when we get off the plane.

563
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,880
Your parents aren't coming?

564
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,160
No. They're on a business trip, as always.

565
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,040
No, that's not true.

566
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:15,120
My parents say they no longer have
a daughter.

567
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,640
You'll always have a family here.

568
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,680
Of course you will.

569
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,400
Thank you.

570
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,080
Look after our little girl, please.

571
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,920
Like she looked after me.

572
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,000
<i>Hi, Nadia.</i>

573
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,360
First, an apology.

574
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,000
This is going to be
the corniest message ever.

575
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,840
<i>But I wanted to say that...</i>

576
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,680
if you ever decide to come back...

577
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,040
<i>I'll be here...</i>

578
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,240
<i>waiting for you.</i>

579
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,160
We have to go.

580
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,640
Yes.

581
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,800
You look familiar.

582
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,040
Andrés, right?

583
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,400
Román.

584
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,160
I don't care
how much you push me away.

585
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,760
I'm a fucking boomerang.

586
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:32,080
And whatever the diagnosis is,
I will be by your side, you hear?

587
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,360
- Omar...
- Even if the chemo takes 100 years.

588
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,880
I'll be at your side in this hospital
for 100 years,

589
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,560
- repeating the same grade.
- Listen.

590
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,640
So what if I graduate when people retire?
I don't give a shit.

591
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,680
But I won't leave you,
because I love you, dickhead.

592
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,160
I haven't stopped loving you
even for one day.

593
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,640
You won't have to.

594
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,120
It's in remission. They just told me.

595
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:02,080
But that was a beautiful speech.

596
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,520
<i>Hi, Guzmán.</i>

597
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,800
