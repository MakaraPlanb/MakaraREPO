00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,600
- You've had enough of me.
- Come on, don't say that.

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,600
No? Come on, say it. You're bored.

I don't know, man.

21
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,800
We should be in a constant hormone party.

Fucking, kissing, going places...
In other words, having fun,

23
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,400
- not staying in like a retired couple.
- Can you let me speak?

24
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,440
If that's not what's wrong,
what is it? Huh?

25
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,680
We're together, we live together.
We're more or less independent...

26
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,680
and the coolest thing we do together
is watch Netflix?

27
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,680
This is a fucking joke.

28
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,160
Jesus, check out that hunk.

29
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,880
Damn, too bad the new guy
didn't end up in our class.

30
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,640
Him? He's not really new.

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,400
Apparently, he was here on a scholarship
about three years ago and had to leave.

32
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,640
- His name is Yeray.
- No way.

33
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,720
So he's "Free Yeray"?

34
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,056
- Fuck.
- Yes.

35
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,120
Apparently,
they used to call him "Free Yeray."

36
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,160
- I'm not sure why.
- It's best if you forget about that kid.

37
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,120
I sure have.

38
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,080

39
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,840
Are you hanging those here?

40
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,240
Uh, Samuel, people here shit
in bathrooms as big as your house.

41
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,520
I'm just printing. I can't afford toner.

42
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,320
Rebe to the rescue, as always.
I'm fine, thanks.

43
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,920
Sure, like hell you are. You wish.

00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,560
Your mom up and leaves,
you have to cover rent,

45
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,280
Carla's ignoring you and making trouble,
and Polo's out of jail.

46
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,560
Are you here to help
or to make me feel even shittier?

47
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,680
Problems should be handled
like fuck buddies:

48
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,240
one per day.

49
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,480
- What are you doing?
- Take this.

50
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,640
I have the perfect roommate for you.

51
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,640
Hey, buddy!

52
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,616
Sell the car, and you can afford to live
with him all year.

53
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,920
You know what, babe?

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,760
My dignity is not for sale.

55
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,680
You lost your dignity
about 200 lines of coke ago, sweetie.

56
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,800
Excuse me.

57
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,600
Living with dignity
means having a roof over your head, idiot,

58
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,400
no matter how good the car looks.

59
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,280
It looks amazing. You know what?

60
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,641
I prefer to keep seeing the world
in my own color palette,

61
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,520
which is more interesting
than his gray scale.

62
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,880
No offense. Thanks anyway.

63
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,920
You're a huge idiot.

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,760
- Yeah, a giant one.
- Here.

65
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,320
For you, sir.

66
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,520
- What's this?
- This guy's number.

67
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,480
Yesterday,
the school established a study program

68
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,400
with Columbia University in New York

69
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,800
that guarantees acceptance to that school.

70
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,120
The program
and tuition will be fully funded.

71
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,920
Candidates will present
individual academic projects

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,280
- by the end of the year, and the winner...
- Who's funding this?

73
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
A generous sponsor.

74
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,560
- As I was saying...
- This happened yesterday?

75
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,040
Because I saw Polo's mother
in your office yesterday.

76
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,560
<i>Look...</i>

77
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,160
if Polo's mom's publishing house
wants to sponsor it, so what?

78
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,320
You're always...

79
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,040
They've already bought you off.
Not the rest of us.

80
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,920
They don't need to buy us off.
Polo was released.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,040
Thank you.

82
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,800
You want to take the scholarship
without feeling guilty, right?

83
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,920
If Nadia wants to apply
for that scholarship, that's her business.

84
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,640
Maybe we should all put this behind us.

85
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,536
- You're not serious.
- I believed you,

86
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,520
but the court didn't.

87
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,800
I believed you over my friend Polo,
my best friend since we were kids.

88
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,040
Maybe I fucked up again.

89
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,160

91

- About what?
- Putting all this behind us...

97

No.

99
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,680
I-I didn't do it, Guzmán.

100
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,280
Then maybe I was serious.

101
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,840
I don't know.

102
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,440
One day, Guzmán's hungry for revenge
like a viking, and the next it's all over?

103
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,720
What do you mean?
Should I not believe him now?

104
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,720
I know you wish everything
would go back to the way it was,

105
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,160
but that won't happen. Ever.

106
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,720
He's trying his best,
and I'm going to do the same.

107
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,600
If he believes me, I believe him.

108
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,760
Ander, how are you going to the hospital
on your own?

109
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,416
- On foot, by bus, a ridesharing app...
- Right.

110
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,560
- What about your mom? And Omar?
- They don't know and won't find out.

111
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,920
- But...
- Is that clear?

112
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,520
Okay, fine. Fine.

113
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,760
- I won't tell if I can go with you.
- Not a chance.

114
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,840
No? Well, that's a shame
because yours truly

115
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,360
will go to the principal's office,
your mom's office,

116
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,840
and tell her everything
faster than you can buy that Coke.

117
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,120
Your call, hot shot.

118
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,400
Good morning.
I'm here to fill out the application

119
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,680
for the scholarship program.

120
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,440
And it's about time, too.

121
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Can I come in?

122
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,480
Nadia. Are you applying too?

123
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,680
Very well.

124
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,560
The more the merrier.

125
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,760
I thought
you wanted to go to St Andrews.

126
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,840
And I do.

127
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,000
Then why are you applying?
This is for Columbia.

128
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,040
Why not?

129
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,760
You shouldn't put all your eggs
in the same basket, right?

130
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,680
With your academic record and references,
you could go to any university you want.

131
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,560
Let's see if I understand.

132
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,160
You're telling me not to apply?

133
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,880
The call for applications
is open to anyone.

134
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,840
Hm.

135
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,600
I'm just saying that...
those who, fortunately,

136
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,560
can gain access to the best education
through other means

137
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,080
could perhaps leave this opportunity
for people who are less fortunate.

138
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,240
My application. Have a good day.

139
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Lucrecia!

140
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,240
- Hi.
- Azucena's right.

141
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,920
- You don't need the scholarship.
- That's not your business or hers.

142
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,160
Are you doing it just to annoy me?

143
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,240
Yes.

144
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,560
Because I love to beat you.

145
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,200
It's much more fun.

146
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,240
And that pleasure is priceless.

147
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,320
Welcome to the competition, hon.
Let the Hunger Games begin.

148
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,240
You don't need to keep pretending.

149
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,560
You can come back to class anytime.

150
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,000
- I don't need your permission.
- I know.

151
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,200
But don't do it for me.

152
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,600
I'm sick of you saying what I want to hear
and then double-crossing me later.

153
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,360
- What do you want now?
- I want you to come back.

154
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,760
It's all over.

155
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,480
Even Guzmán thinks Polo is innocent.

156
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,560
Seriously?

157
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,480
I guess that, when you feel lonely,
you don't want to keep losing people.

158
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,840
That's how I feel, at least.

159
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,400
I just want to get on with my life,

160
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,680
but all the people I care about
keep leaving me.

161
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,520
Even my mom's gone.

162
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,880
Polo is out,
Guzmán is getting close to him again...

163
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,696
You two started so much shit,
and everything's the same as it was.

164
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,160
No, not everything.

165
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,800
- What has changed?
- Us.

166
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,280
What about us?

167
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,240
"Us," Samuel? There is no us.

168
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,640
Let's change that.
I don't want to lose you too.

169
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,320
Come back, please.

170
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,720
Hi.

171
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,120
Hey.

172
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,720
Can I sit here?

173
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,760
Yeah, sure.

174
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,000
I can't get used to it.

175
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,880
I just want to get out of here
and avoid the stares.

176
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,560
- What?
- Let's go.

177
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,600
I don't feel like being here either.
I never do, but even less so today.

178
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,560
Where do you want to go?

179
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,800
I don't know. Out.

180
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,840
Maybe to my place. My folks are out.

181
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,920
We could play video games.

182
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,240
Great.
That sounds perfect.

183
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,840
It's important that you tell us
everything you've seen,

184
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,040
anything you think might be useful.

185
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,000
Everything. Any detail could be key.

186
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,520
Lu, since you're always saying
you didn't send the video of me and Guzmán

187
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,600
to the whole school,

188
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,240
I wanted to tell you I won't tell everyone
about you and Valerio.

189
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,960
<i>How would you prefer me not to tell?</i>

190
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,840
<i>A meme with the gradient background?
A GIF and little colored letters?</i>

191
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,600
I need that scholarship.

192
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,280
You don't.

193
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,120
Withdraw from the competition immediately.

194
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,920
Wow. You really are smart.

195
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,640
It takes a very special person
to carry out that sort of threat.

196
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,880
<i>My dear, I don't think you have it in you.</i>

197
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,760
<i>May the best one win.</i>

198
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
<i>Kisses.</i>

199
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,720
Bitch.

200
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,920
Beer at this hour?

201
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,560
Who cares what time it is?
It's the plan that matters.

202
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,920
What?

203
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,040
Nothing, just...

204
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,880
I didn't think we'd ever do this again.

205
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,880
Sorry if I'm getting all soppy, but...

206
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,160
you don't know how much I wanted things
to go back to normal.

207
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,880
Thank you.

208
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,400
Come on,
you're getting too soppy now.

209
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,920
Drink your beer.

210
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,720
You're back.

211
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,000
I have the world's best reheated macaroni
at home.

212
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,640
When are you coming over for lunch?

213
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,400
Fuck.

214
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,560
- Do I know you?
- Sorry.

215
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,760
Shit. What?

216
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
What?

217
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,680
Ander, fucking say something.

218
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,280
Sing, dance, whatever,
but lighten up a bit.

219
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,840
Don't be a pain in the ass.
I'm just not talkative.

220
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,320
- You're the definition of pigheaded.
- And you shouldn't be here.

221
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,280
- You're right. Your mom should be...
- Enough.

222
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,240
They'll tell me what the treatment is.
It'll be no big deal, and I'll go home.

223
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,480
I don't see the fucking need
to tell anyone.

224
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,240
Well, you told me.

225
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,440
- I mean the people who love me.
- Hey, I love you.

226
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,360
- You don't love me. I just turn you on.
- It's a form of love, hot stuff.

227
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,520
See how good it feels
when you just relax a bit?

228
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,560
Tell me about you.

229
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,160
Tell me a secret that nobody knows.
You know mine.

230
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,880
Well...

231
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,080
I mean, it's something, but it's not...

232
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,600
I think that...
sometimes, some girls turn me on, too.

233
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,920
Ah. Congratulations.

234
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,800
- Nadia, right?
- No way.

235
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,520
Worse. The marchioness.

236
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,680
Of course. She turns me on too.
She even turns Omar on.

237
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,840
What about guys?

238
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,520
Who?

239
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,160
Samuel.

240
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,080
- I don't believe you.
- It's true, man.

241
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,160
I mean, he's hot.

242
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,400
I'd do him.

243
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,720
Ander Muñoz? You can come in.

244
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,040
WHAT'S CHEMOTHERAPY?

245
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,000
Acute lymphocytic leukemia
is a fast-growing cancer.

246
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,360
That means we have to be even faster.

247
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,760
We'll start with chemo this week.

248
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,360
I promise we'll hit it
with everything we've got.

249
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,480
It'll be two six-week cycles,

250
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,000
but they'll feel longer than that,
to be honest.

251
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,200
With such intensive treatment,
the side effects will also be intense.

252
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,080
It's all in that brochure,

253
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,920
but I'm telling you now,
it won't be easy to prevent fatigue,

254
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,400
...nausea, vomiting, dizziness...

255
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,600
and also nerve pain in the joints.

256
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,240
You won't feel like eating,
going out, or doing practically anything.

257
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,600
And, yes,
your hair will probably fall out.

258
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,320
It's the first thing everyone asks.

259
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,680
Over the next few months...

260
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,120
Ander?

261
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,280
Yes, Rebe. I'll tell them.

262
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,640
Okay? As soon as I get home. I promise.

263
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,680
Yes, that too.

264
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,520
But what I meant is...

265
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,560
you'll die of old age.
You know that, right?

266
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Carla.

267
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,040
- Uh... are you okay?
- Excuse me?

268
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,600
You were never one to skip
so many days of school, and...

269
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,280
- Well, I'm here if you need anything.
- Let's see.

270
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,080
You keep staring at me in the hallway,

271
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,520
you know I don't skip class,
you know my name...

272
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,880
You've only been here for two minutes,
and you're already creeping me out.

273
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,560
Sorry,
I didn't want to make you uncomfortable,

274
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,920
but...

275
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,720
- do you really not remember me?
- Creeping me out big time.

276
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,160
Uh...

277
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,560
Three years ago,
I uploaded a picture to Instagram,

278
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,280
and I got ridiculed and body-shamed
by half the school.

279
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,400
Body-shamed? You?

280
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,920
No. I used to be...

281
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,480
Well...

282
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,720
Is this you?

283
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,880
- Yes.
- Shit.

284
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,960
"You disgusting fat fuck."

285
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,600
"I'd donate some clothes,
but they wouldn't fit."

286
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,040
- Okay, I get the picture.
- Wait.

287
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,160
Read... this comment.

288
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,920
"You are the ones
who are disgusting.

289
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,480
When we hate someone,
it's because they represent something

290
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,880
we hate in ourselves.

291
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,120
Yeray, ignore them
and keep showing yourself as you are.”

292
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,280
Did I write this?

293
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,400
Shit. I didn't know I was so intense.

294
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,360
When I saw a girl like you
defending me in public...

295
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,320
What do you mean, "a girl like me"?

296
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,200
- Pretty.
- Right.

297
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,280
Intelligent.

298
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,560
- I mean, a marchioness!
- I can't take credit for any of that.

299
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,880
But for defending me, you can.
It helped a lot.

300
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,080
Well, I'm glad I helped you
three years ago.

301
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,640
You bet it all on black, and you won.

302
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,480
What I meant to say is...

303
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,320
it's time to collect your prize, right?

304
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,640
Right.

305
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,600
Uh... I'm not too into prizes right now,
but, hey,

306
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,760
I'm happy to see you again, Yeray.

307
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,960
<i>We had made up.</i>

308
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,800
I realized there was no real evidence
against him...

309
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,160
and that I had just wanted to blame him.

310
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,080
So we talked it over
and gave each other a second chance.

311
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,280
We were childhood friends, after all.

312
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,080
I never would have hurt him.

313
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,280
I'm going to make it, right?

314
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,480
Well, of course you are.

315
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,080
I'm crying because I'm still shocked,
but of course you'll make it.

316
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,480
You're not saying that
because you're my mom, right?

317
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,640
Yes, I'm saying that
because I'm your mom.

318
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,400
I won't leave you alone for a second.

319
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,840
But you are going to make it.
You'll get better.

320
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,920
Go on, honey. Tell him.

321
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,240
This is about teamwork,
and we need to get on it.

322
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,440
Fuck, Ander,
I asked you yesterday.

323
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,440
I didn't want to say anything.

324
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,120
But it'll get obvious,

325
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,320
and my mom will have to deal with it,
so I told her.

326
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,000
- Like I won't have to deal with it?
- No.

327
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,040
- What?
- This doesn't affect you, Omar.

328
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,560
Okay, yeah, it affects you
because we're together.

329
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,200
But we haven't known each other long.

330
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,160
We hooked up because we were less
than 500 meters apart in the app.

331
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,880
Otherwise, we wouldn't have met.

332
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,400
Two days later, you fucking moved in.

333
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Am I right?

334
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,640
Are you pushing me away
to play the romantic hero?

335
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,360
To save me from the pain
or some shit like that?

336
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,480
I'm telling you
that this isn't your responsibility.

337
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,600
That's all!

338
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,280
You should be out and about, fucking!
That's what you should be doing.

339
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,960
You said it yourself.

340
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,960
You should be in a constant hormone party,
and not here with me like this.

341
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,280
Do you want me to leave now?

342
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,160
Whenever's best for you.

343
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,400
This is some party
you're having here, huh? I love it.

344
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,800
My mom's business meetings
turn into parties.

345
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,760
Happens every week. Typical.

346
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,200
- What do you want?
- A quick favor.

347
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,360
- I need a loan.
- Money?

348
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,320
- No way. Sell the car.
- Not money.

349
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,280
It's... coca-ine.

350
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,480
You're kidding, right?

351
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,960
No, Rebe. You'd be doing me a favor,
and I always return a favor,

352
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,040
so don't worry.

353
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,280
I know shady dealings go down
at your house.

354
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,440
Rebe,
get the good gin from the cellar.

355
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,680
Baby, I've told you to let me know
if you're bringing a date.

356
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,176
- A date? He's not a date.
- Valerio, ma'am. Nice to meet you.

357
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,160
- I'm Rebe's classmate.
- I'm Sandra.

358
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,640
And don't call me "ma'am."
We're practically family.

359
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,760
Family? You just met him.

360
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,080
A pleasure, Sandra.
What are we celebrating, then?

361
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,720
It's nothing.
Just drinks and snacks with friends.

362
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,080
Sounds like fun.

363
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,040
- Why didn't you mention it?
- That's enough. I'll get the gin.

364
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,336
- And you, get the fuck out of here.
- Language!

365
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,240
I taught you some fucking manners!

366
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,520
Valerio, just ignore her.
I'm the one in charge here.

367
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,000
- Would you like a drink?
- Don't even think about it.

368
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,080
Of course I would.

369
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,400
How could I say no
to such a wonderful invitation?

370
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,721
It really does look
like she's the one in charge here, hm?

371
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,040
Guzmán, listen to me.

372
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,840
School's out for the day.
They'll notice he's missing.

373
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,336
When they see you and I are gone...
We're not exactly...

374
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,040
We need him to tell us
where the trophy is.

375
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,640
If we get the trophy, he'll go to jail.

376
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,400
How do we make him talk?

377
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,120
With the towel,

378
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,120
we won't leave marks.

379
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,560
Did you plan this?

380
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,400
You had no choice but to make your mom
believe you were dead.

381
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,360
Well, I had no choice but to plan this.

382
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,520
Polo!

383
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,600
Wake up! Come on, wake up.

384
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,680
Some of your classmates
say that you were...

385
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,920
very aggressive with him tonight.

386
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,720
I didn't do it.

387
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,480
But if I knew who did,
I wouldn't tell you.

388
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,600
That means you know who did it.

389
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,120
That means I'd never tell you.

390
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,040
Carla.

391
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,200
- How are you? Fully recovered?
- Mm-hmm.

392
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,360
I'm going upstairs. I'm a bit tired.

393
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,400
One thing, darling.

394
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,520
- That kid... uh, Samuel.
- What?

395
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,040
You talked to the police
when you thought he was missing.

396
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,480
You went back to school
when he asked you to...

397
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,080
He's controlling you.

398
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,280
How unlike you.

399
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,200
He's not good for you.

400
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,120
And it won't be good for him
if I catch him near you.

401
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,160
Get some rest.

For you and me. Over for good.

Polo, please, tell me where the trophy is.

00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
- Tell me!
- Guzmán!

425
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,760
Guzmán! Holy shit! stop!

426
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,720
Kill me.

427
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,920
I...

428
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,440
didn't want to kill Marina.

429
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,480
It was an accident, Guzmán.
It was an accident.

430
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,080
Son of a...

431
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,360
But you're doing this to me on purpose.

432
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,160
- You're capable of killing me.
- Guzmán!

433
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,400
Guzmán, stop, damn it!

434
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,360
- I am not a killer!
- Enough! Stop!

435
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,600
Let him go!

436
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,440
Guzmán, let him go!

437
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,520

There’s nothing I enjoy more
than entertaining guests.

449
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,080
And there’s nothing I hate more
than being hustled in my own house.

Excuse me, Sandra.

451
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,840
I didn't want to seem ungrateful or rude.

452
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,720
I wanted some,

453
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,160
and I've been
a little short on cash lately.

454
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,680
All that private school and fancy clothes,
and in the end...

455
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,480
- How old are you?
- Nineteen.

456
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,840
Okay, you're old enough to vote.

457
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,800
Do you want it?

458
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,200
- Yes, I'd like some.
- How much do you want it?

459
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,680
It helps me feel better about myself.

460
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,760
- How much?
- A lot.

461
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,720
One gram.

462
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,040
Get undressed.

463
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,200
Come on.

464
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,200
Two grams.

465
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,120
On your knees in front of me.

466
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,840
Didn't you want it a lot?
Let's see how much is a lot.

467
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,720
I'm cutting you a good deal.

468
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,600
Come over here.

469
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,240
Three grams.

470
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,120
Look at yourself.

471
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,760
Do yourself a favor. Look at yourself.

472
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,120
Get out of here.

473
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,040
It'd be your word against ours.

474
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:59,280
ARE YOU SURE I WON'T DO IT?

475
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:06,400
THIS IS A COUNTDOWN.

476
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,920
You're bluffing, right?

477
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,800
Ten, nine...

478
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,160
Do you want to see if I'm bluffing?

479
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,720
Five, four...

480
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,840
You're not withdrawing your application?

481
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,240
I'll start by telling her.

482
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,600
She'll love it.

483
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,960
And she'll waste no time telling everyone.

484
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,600
Have a good day, darling.

485
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,800
Nadia.

486
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,760
I can't withdraw my application.
I need that scholarship as much as you do.

487
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,440
<i>My father knows everything.</i>

488
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,680
I'm an embarrassment to my family.

489
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,760
T-They cut me off. I have no money, Nadia.

490
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,800
Right. Am I supposed to believe that?

491
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,720
I'm not lying to you, Nadia.

492
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,440
You don't know how much I hate...

493
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,440
...for you to see me like this...

494
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,920
but I have no choice.

495
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,240
I need...

496
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,960
that scholarship, Nadia.

497
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,840
And I won't rest until I get it.

498
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,520
Even if it means losing my dignity.

499
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,920
If you knew about me
what I know about you,

500
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,840
would you use it to destroy me and win?

501
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,520
That's very likely.

502
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,200
But I hope you won't do it...

503
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,800
because you're a better person
in that sense.

504
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,160
<i>Only </i>in that sense.

505
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,200
YESTERDAY WAS A SHITTY DAY
I NEED TO BE WITH YOU

506
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:26,320
WAIT FOR YOU AFTER SCHOOL?

507
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,320
Are you okay, Guzmán?

508
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,560
You applied to Polo's mothers' program.

509
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,080
It didn't bother you the other day.

510
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,240
It's complicated.

511
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,200
With you, everything is.

512
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,480
Like everything's simple with you?

513
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,640
No, I guess not.

514
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,920
You know that feeling when you wake up
and you don't know where you are

515
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
or who you are?

516
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,280
I feel like that every day.

517
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,160
And I suddenly remember
my sister's dead.

518
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,520
But I also remember you'll be in class
when I come through the door.

519
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,080
And that's the only reason
why I get out of bed.

520
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,840
You don't make my life complicated.

521
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,360
Actually, you saved it.

522
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,360
That video made me...

523
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,400
lose a scholarship.

524
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,640
My future.

525
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,280
I also could have lost
my family, my home, my life...

526
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,040
Guzmán, I know it wasn't your fault,

527
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,800
but every time we get together...

528
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,360
Good luck with that program, Nadia.

529
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,640
COFFEE? TEA? CHAMOMILE? ROOIBOS?

530
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,920
I'M WILLING TO READ
THE WHOLE DRINKS MENU...

531
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,800
I'm fine.

532
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,760
First time and first session?

533
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,480
I'm Alexis.

534
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,040
If you need any tips or advice
on how to handle this...

535
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:45,000
...or need to trash-talk someone,
you know where I am.

536
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,880
- Thank you.
- See you later.

537
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,400
Bye.

538
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,600
Hi.

539
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,600
I'll get you some juice.

540
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,800
The nurse said you'll have
a metallic taste in your mouth afterwards.

541
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,760
Are you staying?

542
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,720
I'll see where I end up tomorrow.
But for now, I'm here.

543
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,400
I won't hold your hand.
I know you want to be tough.

544
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,440
It hasn't been long,
but I know you pretty well.

545
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,880
This takes three hours, right?

546
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,760
Did you bring your charger?
My battery is running low.

- Or at least trying it.

573

574
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,320

Okay, okay.

Hey, still looking for a roommate?

583
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,520
I'm fine now.
I have a roommate. All good. Are you okay?

584
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,280
What's wrong?

585
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,520
I can't say. It's about a friend.

586
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,920
And if I tell you,
my friend will kill me before he dies.

587
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,040
Huh?

588
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,760
Life flies by, Samu.

589
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,280
We think we'll live a hell of a long time,

590
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,160
so we spend all day
complaining about shit,

591
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,160
or, in my case,
listening to other people's shit,

592
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,360
which I have no interest in.

593
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,760
What about my shit?
Nobody listens to that.

594
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Even I don't listen.

595
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,400
And by the time I realize it,
maybe it'll be too late.

596
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,480
And there'll be no time left.

597
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,480
And I don't want to run out of time,
man.

598
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,120
I don't want to regret not doing
what I want to do.

599
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:11,520
Do it. Whatever you want to do,
you have to just do it.

600
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,320
Okay.

601
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,040
I dived in the pool,
and there was no water.

602
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,360
It happens sometimes.

603
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:37,920
No, all the time.

604
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,400
No.

605
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,920
Not all the time.

606
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,960
Call an ambulance,
please! Call an ambulance!

607
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,240
Polo.

608
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,120
Polo.

609
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,520
Polo.
