1
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,920
Good morning.

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,720
Would you like some coffee or tea?

3
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,520
Some toast with cured ham and tomato?

4
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,000
No? Nothing?

5
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,640
Oh, damn, that's right. You're on duty.

6
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,120
I hadn't noticed.

7
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,600
Don't worry, I'm fine.

8
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,440
- What are you looking at?
- Want to take a picture?

9
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,840
It's not like it's the first time
someone's been arrested at this school.

10
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,920
She's right.

11
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,560
Before, we just had a murderer
and a wannabe con artist.

12
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,920
Now that the narco's been arrested,

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,840
Las Encinas pretty much looks
like Guantanamo.

14
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,480
- Let's go to class.
- I see you two are all chummy.

15
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,680
Are you friends again?

16
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,840
We're working on it.

17
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,640
Sure.

18
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,040
- Mwah.
- Hey, hey.

19
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,080
I seriously don't get what's going on
at this fucking school, really.

20
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,040
Ready for Valentine's Day?

21
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,640
We'll have flowers,
a meal at the best restaurant,

22
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,656
- and maybe a few surprises...
- Please.

23
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,040
Actually, we always celebrate
at Lu's, right?

24
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,200
- Yes.
- Not me. I've never been invited.

25
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,560
- Not to Valentine's Day or anything else.
- Right.

26
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,840
I... don't feel like doing that this year.

27
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,120
I don't want to throw a party

28
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,080
because I'm crazy busy with my studies
and the Columbia program, so...

29
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,400
Is that why?
Or is it because you have no friends left?

30
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,600
What did my mom say?

31
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,960
You know, the usual stuff:
"How are you? How's school?

32
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,400
Hey, is your mom
a mobster drug dealer?"

33
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,480
So what if she is?

34
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,360
Was it my fault
that my dad was behind bars?

35
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,720
What can we do to help?

36
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,080
Well...

37
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,440
...could you lend me some cash?

38
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,040
For the bus, the 314.
I take it to visit my mom at the prison.

39
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,800
Don't be ridiculous. Here.

40
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,440
Take a taxi.

41
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,600
- Uh, Lu?
- What?

42
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,520
It's not my business,
but the whole party thing...

43
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,520
it's because you don't have the money
to host it, right?

44
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,000
You're right,
it's <i>not </i>your business...

45
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,160
darling.

46
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,080
I see.

47
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,680
Fuck.

48
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,400
We even have an audience.
They've got everything here.

49
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,160
Spoiler alert: you're not winning
Mother of the Year.

50
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,200
Hey. This is just a bump in the road.

51
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,920
It's nothing we can't handle.
We always manage to hang in there.

52
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,440
<i>We? </i>Don't kid yourself.
There is no "we," all right?

53
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,360
Baby, you're pissed off, I get it.

54
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,120
But I'm telling you,
I'll be out of here before you know it.

55
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,360
Sure. And until then,
what the hell am I going to live on? Huh?

56
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,880
Okay, then.

57
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,160
I'll have to break open the piggy bank.

58
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,960
Rebe.

59
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,840
Fight. Don't give up.

60
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,040
And hit the punching bag.
You're letting yourself go.

61
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,960
I know Valentine's Day
is a Christian thing,

62
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,240
- but it's just a dinner.
- I can't go.

63
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,360
- Besides, it's my mother's birthday.
- I see.

64
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,600
But thanks for the invitation.

65
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,680
Honey... go. It's okay.

66
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,760
Mom.

67
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,160
Um...
would you like to celebrate with us?

68
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,720
The restaurant has a Michelin star.

69
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,480
Thanks, son,
but it's a little out of our price range.

70
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,280
It's on the house.

71
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,120
The owners are friends of my father's.

72
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,720
Mom, you deserve it.

73
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,160
- Hm?
- Mm-hmm.

74
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,720
Invite whoever you want.
Omar will come, right?

75
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,720
Omar will always have a place
at our table...

76
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,160
but I don't think he'll accept.

77
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,040
Thank you very much for the invitation.

78
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,920
<i>We </i>will go.

79
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,800
You got what you wanted.
When do I get what you promised me?

80
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,640
- <i>It's not easy. We need time.</i>
- What do you mean?

81
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,400
Well, if it isn't the Queen of the South!

82
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,680
What a surprise. Come in.

83
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,880
Be careful.
A horse's head could turn up in your bed.

84
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,880
- Come on in.
- Sure.

85
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,656
- What are you doing here?
- I could ask you the same.

86
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,880
I've been calling you.
Who were you talking to?

87
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,720
The phone company. The bastards
kept me on hold for half an hour.

88
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,600
Listen, with all the confusion,

89
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,480
I didn't realize
I can't go back to my house.

90
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,560
Um, can I spend the night here?

91
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,440
Sure.

92
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,760
Thanks, Samu.
You're all I have right now.

93
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,520
It's not a problem.

94
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,640
I had nowhere else to go.
Don't take it as a compliment.

95
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,280
Valentine's Day is going to be
very different this year.

96
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,840
I'll be planning it.

97
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,480
- "Reverse Valentine's"?
- That's right.

98
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,160
Oh, please. Let's be honest.

99
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,640
It's become a boring, cheesy,
and old-fashioned tradition.

100
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,920
The flowers, the chocolate, the colors...

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,880
And we girls are objectified.

102
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,720
We spend hours at the salon
to look good for the guys.

103
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,080
All that's over now. I had this great idea

104
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,320
that the roles should be reversed
this time.

105
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,400
The guys will be the ones
who show some skin...

106
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,240
...and the girls
will get dressed up in elegant tuxedos...

107
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,120
penguin suits, if you will.

108
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,040
Bring your own drinks?

109
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,160
Yes, darling.

110
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,840
The roles are reversed.
Guests bring their own drinks and food.

111
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,480
And I, the hostess and queen of the night,
will just enjoy myself.

112
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,040
That way, we'll prevent lowlifes

113
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,800
from thinking this is an NGO
and taking stuff home.

114
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,440
Clever, huh?
That's fine, we'll throw our own party.

115
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,240
Ugh. Don't mind her.
Are you guys coming to the party?

116
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,840
- No, they're not.
- Oh, the party's at your house now?

117
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,776
No, and it's not at yours, either.
You got kicked out for using, I guess.

118
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,280
Since when do you have something
against drugs, Guzmán?

119
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,440
Remember, you used to beg me for them.

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,040
I have something against traitors...
and murderers.

121
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,320
Why are you defending them?

122
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,800
- I don't need to explain myself to you...
- Enough, Valerio, please.

123
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,440
What do you say, Lu?

124
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,080
- You're talking to me?
- Yes.

125
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,360
Um, what a dilemma.
I'm like Switzerland here.

126
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,120
- Hm.
- A rich, beautiful country...

127
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,040
that doesn't get involved
in anyone's wars.

128
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,240
- Lu.
- What do you want?

129
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,040
Can we talk for a moment?

130
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,480
Sure,
but you'll need to get cleaned up first.

131
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,320
What... what the hell, Lu?

132
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,320
- You fucking ruined my life, asshole.
- Lu, I just want to talk...

133
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,240
Come to the party.
You can't let them exclude you like that.

134
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,080
And what good would that do us?

135
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,440
We'd have a shitty night,
and everyone would ignore us.

136
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,160
You won't be alone. You'll be with me.

137
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,680
And that won't be good for you.
Don't you get it?

138
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,360
That's too bad.
I hate everything that's good for me.

139
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,560
I also hate vegetables.
I hate getting exercise.

140
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,680
I hate hanging out
with the right people...

141
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,320
and I hate doing what people expect of me.

142
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,160
Still... it's absurd, since we can't go

143
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,680
to a Valentine's party
as a group of three.

144
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,760
Why not?

145
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,640
I like you both.

146
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,520
I don't know what they told you,

147
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,160
but the thing
between Carla, Christian, and me...

148
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,960
did not end well.

149
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,360
Damn, Lu was right.

150
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,920
We have to turn all this around.

151
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,720
- Unless you guys don't like me...
- We do.

152
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,080
- I mean...
- We do?

153
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,120
But that's besides the point,
because...

154
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760
...this is just crazy, right?

155
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,320
A beautiful kind of crazy.

156
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,320
Come to the party with me.

157
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,320
Our lives are already complicated enough.

158
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,000
- Good work, Lu, as always.
- Hm.

159
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,600
Nadia...

160
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,960
...I'm giving you two days to redo this.

161
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,760
You won't get into the program
if you don't.

162
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,240
I know you can do a much better job.
Okay?

163
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,720
- Hm?
- Mm-hmm.

164
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,600
- Nadia, are you all right?
- Yes.

165
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,840
The teacher must have run out of red ink
grading your exam.

166
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,200
At least he gave you a second chance.

167
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,880
- I wish I could take advantage of it.
- What?

168
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,160
I don't have time.

169
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,520
My parents go to rehabilitation
every day, and I have to be at the store.

170
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,200
- Why don't you tell them you can't?
- You already know the answer.

171
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,160
- How are you?
- Hi.

172
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,080
Guzmán, right?

173
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,400
- Yes.
- Malick.

174
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,680
Nice to meet you.
Nadia has told me a lot about you.

175
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,000
Oh, really? She never mentioned you.

176
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,960
Yeah. Well,
you don't talk that much lately, right?

177
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,240
Thanks for your concern. See you tomorrow.

178
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,720
Bye, man. Nice to meet you.

179
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,160
It's Mom's birthday.

180
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,160
- She'd be so happy if you came.
- And Dad?

181
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,080
He also wants to see you.

182
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,200
Sure. And when I tell him
I'm with a guy who's an atheist,

183
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,120
he'll have another stroke.

184
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,680
- You don't need to bring it up.
- Sorry, how is this any of your business,

185
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,760
apart from paying for the meal and stuff?

186
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,840
He's my boyfriend.

187
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,920
Right. Well, that guy's my boyfriend.

188
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,600
I can't take him to dinner.
I can't speak about him.

189
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,280
I can't say I love him.

190
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,040
Because my happiness
makes our parents unhappy.

191
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,040
Can you imagine what that's like?
You can't, can you?

192
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,920
Have a nice day.

193
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,120
It would be after dinner.

194
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,600
Some music...

195
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,840
A quiet party, you know?
Lucrecia is organizing it.

196
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,400
Isn't she that friend of yours
who speaks Arabic?

197
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,480
Mm-hmm.

198
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,360
Yusef, let's go to rehabilitation.

199
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,720
Hello.

200
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,400
- What are you doing here?
- Buying asparagus.

201
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,560
How are you, Malick?

202
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,520
Hi, Nadia. What's up?

203
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,720
I thought you'd be studying
after the lecture the teacher gave you.

204
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,920
What lecture?

205
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,880
Uh...

206
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,120
It's just that...

207
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,080
...I haven't been able to spend much time
on the Columbia program.

208
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,720
Working here every afternoon,
I don't have time to...

209
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,480
do the assignments well.

210
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,840
I'm sorry, Nadia. What else can I do?
I don't have anyone else.

211
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,400
It's okay, Dad.

212
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,720
I only told you because you asked.

213
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,800
She's missing out
on the opportunity of a lifetime,

214
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,840
- and you're doing nothing.
- Guzmán!

215
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,480
Are you telling me how to treat my family,
spoiled brat?

216
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,960
There's no need.
You've only driven two of your kids away.

217
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,761
- Did you come to insult me?
- I came because I'm worried about Nadia.

218
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,960
Other people aren't, so they keep quiet.

219
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,680
What they say about you is true.
You're totally disrespectful.

220
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,920
Malick! Guzmán, leave.

221
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,200
If you're so clever,

222
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,720
- what do you suggest I do?
- Hire someone.

223
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,840
Ah! How did I not think of that?
Everything's so easy when you have money.

224
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,760
If you're concerned about her future,
you'll find a way.

225
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,960
Guzmán, please!

226
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,360
If you're so concerned,
why don't you do it?

227
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,880
You want to help her, right?

228
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,920
Or is getting your hands dirty
beneath you?

229
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,840
Sure. It'd be unpaid work, I suppose.

230
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,480
Three euros an hour.
People who work in the fields earn less.

231
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,760
Deal.

232
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,360
You won't last one day.

233
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,440
Can you pass me an apron
or whatever you wear here?

234
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,160
I will never forgive you for this.

235
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,360
- I'm doing this for you.
- No. You're doing it for yourself,

236
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,520
out of pride.

237
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,280
Do you want a photo?
Go on, get moving.

238
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,240
I'm working here, dammit.

239
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,560
Holy shit!

240
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,000
Is that how you work?
Scaring the customers away?

241
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,680
- I'm not a trained monkey.
- A trained monkey?

242
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,360
- Be careful.
- So... what else is there to do?

243
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,320
Finish cleaning up
and organize the boxes inside.

244
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,160
Tomorrow, you'll do it all again.
And the day after. And the day after that.

245
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,200
Did you think one day would help Nadia?

246
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,840
You'd need to be here every day
until the end of the school year.

247
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,640
Bye.

248
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,440
Fuck.

249
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,640
It's not just that I don’t even have
the money to buy you a beer.

250
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,520
The problem is I don't know
what I'll live on until she'sout.

251
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,560
- That is, if she gets out.
- She'll get out.

252
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,600
Maybe this will convince her to stop.

253
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,080
You could both live a quieter life,

254
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,160
without worrying about thugs
and the police.

255
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,680
It looks like I'll have to thank
the snitch.

256
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,280
Because I know
there was a snitch involved.

<i>♪ You’re chasing me... ♪</i>

258
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,160
I'll have to go home
and break open the piggy bank.

259
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,280
What?

260
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,040
My mother slits open an armchair
we have in the basement

261
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,320
so she can stash cash for emergencies
in there.

262
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,520
But the cops have your house sealed off.

263
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,360
- What if you get caught?
- What will they do to me, huh?

264
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,760
I don't know,
and I don't want to find out.

265
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,640
Rebe, if anything happened to you,
I'd never forgive myself.

00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,960
Right. Is that why you want me to lie?

274
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,600
You think I don't lie?

275
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,200
My dad loves me

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,000
Don't spoil the little time
I have left. Is that too much to ask?

317

Let's get to class.

318
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,880

322
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,440
Why?

bad times,

324
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,000

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,720
Happy Valentine's Day, Lu.

329
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,000
If you're bringing someone,
bring more to drink.

330
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,920
I'll go alone.
But if those two are there, I won't stay.

334
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,040
But I don't want to leave you

- You said <i>this </i>was the first and last one.
- Just one more!

339
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,960
Shit!

340
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,640
Careful, guys! Guzmán!

341
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,840
Help me pick this up
before someone else gets hurt.

342
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,280
Where's the neck of the bottle?

343
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,520
Excuse me.

344
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,080
Rebeca, come out here
for a moment, please.

345
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,000
Come with me.

346
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,040
Whatever you have to say,
you can say it here.

347
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,720
The Parents Association
has made things difficult.

348
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,760
The charges against your mom are serious,
and the school's reputation is at risk.

349
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,560
You're kicking my ass out, right?

350
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,200
We will offer you the chance
to drop out voluntarily.

351
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,720
It won't go on your permanent record.

352
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,360
Damn, how thoughtful of you.

353
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,320
You just have to sign this document.

354
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,880
No. Kick me out.

355
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,400
- Let the whole fucking school know.
- What?

356
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,360
Let everyone and their mother know
that when a rich kid's dad went to jail,

357
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,480
<i>- he </i>didn't get kicked out!
- Don't shout.

358
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,600
- What's going on?
- Go back to class, Samuel.

359
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,240
Let fucking everyone know
that I'm getting kicked out!

360
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,720
- Calm down. Guzmán!
- But if your moms fund a scholarship,

361
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,920
you don't get expelled,

362
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,880
- even if you're a fucking murderer!
- Ander!

363
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,800
- You can't expel her.
- It's voluntary.

364
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,960
- I'm leaving too, then.
- What?

365
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,280
If she leaves, I leave.

366
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,840
Me too.

367
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,680
And me.

368
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,440
Me too.

369
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,080
And me too, okay?

370
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,840
What's going on?

371
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,280
I'll try to talk to the board, okay?

372
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,400
Now, go back to class, please.

373
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,320
What a mess you made, kiddo.

374
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,560
Thanks.

375
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,120
You're welcome.

376
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,600
I need you to...

377
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,120
help me mess things up a bit more.

378
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,360
What?

379
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,360
Don't! You can't touch that.
It'd be too obvious.

380
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,880
- Ah.
- This way.

381
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,400
Come on, go up.

382
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,120
You're heavy.

383
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,280
Holy shit.

384
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,200
Be careful.

385
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,120
- Do you have springs in your shoes?
- Among other things.

386
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,880
Come down.

387
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,360
Why the hell do you have that?

388
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,160
To peel fruit. What else?

389
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,520
Is it there?

390
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,240
I don't know.

391
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,400
Nothing here.

392
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,160
Shit. Didn't she say anything else?

393
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,720
Nothing.
She told me to work out.

394
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,760
She said I was letting myself go.
That piece of...

395
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,880
What?

396
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,680
She said to hit the punching bag.

397
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,840
She told me to hit the punching bag.

398
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,800
Holy shit.

399
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,240
I can't believe this.

400
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,080
Do you like my Bumblebee?

401
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,760
- What?
- Bumblebee, <i>Transformers.</i>

402
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,160
Never mind.

403
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,360
I wish you signed things
as fast as you buy cars.

404
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,800
So you only like me
if I invest in your wine business?

405
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,880
How does this work?

406
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,440
No. I like people who keep their word.

407
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,080
But that investment isn't a car.
It's like 10,000 cars.

408
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,680
It's not like pulling out your credit card
and buying...

409
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,480
...I don't know... this?

410
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,760
- Hm. For the party?
- Mm-hmm.

411
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,800
You'll look very sexy in it.
Because it's for you, right?

412
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,440
- The roles are reversed tonight.
- No, no, no.

413
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,080
Just because your friend
has gone all feminist,

414
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,776
I'm not making a fool of myself
our first Valentine's Day together.

415
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,200
We'll be making fools of ourselves
if we don't follow the dress code.

416
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,800
- Everyone will stare at us.
- Let them stare...

417
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,160
and see you looking amazing...

418
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,080
- on my arm.
- Actually, I'd rather go alone.

419
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,400
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.

420
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,480
- How are you, Yeray?
- Great.

421
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,840
Honey, don't be so fussy.

422
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,880
You need to thank Yeray
for the thoughtful gesture.

423
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,800
Sure, he did it for me, right?

424
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,920
Put that dress on
and stop acting like a little girl.

425
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,520
Please.

426
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,480
We haven't closed so early in ages.

427
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,400
There aren't many customers
this late in the day anyway.

428
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,280
But don't worry about that.

429
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,120
Focus on what you need to do.

430
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,680
- What about the store?
- There's no need to open every day.

431
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,880
Or to go to the hospital either.
I'm already perfectly fine.

432
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,120
What do they say? "Strong as a mule."

433
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,240
"As an <i>ox," </i>Dad.
"Strong as an ox."

434
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,960
Strong as an ox.

435
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,560
Are we still waiting or...?

436
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,120
Um, yes.

437
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,880
No, we'll order now.

438
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,200
- Hi.
- Ah.

439
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,600
Sorry I'm late.

440
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,480
- Dad.
- Son.

441
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,080
Okay. We need to get rid of this now.

442
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,240
How much could you get for this shit?

443
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,480
This is Molly, so a few thousand.

444
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,200
- What does it matter?
- I can't even afford canned beans, Samu.

445
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,000
I don't care if we have to live on
rice with tomato sauce,

446
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,200
- you're not getting mixed up in this.
- He's right.

447
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,960
You're not getting mixed up in this. I am.

448
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:47,240
I'll sell it. We'll become partners,
and we'll go fifty-fifty. What do you say?

449
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,440
Partnering with you
is even worse than pushing drugs,

450
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,200
- so it's a no.
- What's wrong?

451
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,680
I'm a reliable guy.

452
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,040
- We'll flush it down the toilet.
- No. No, no, no.

453
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,440
Let's think this through
before we do anything stupid.

454
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,520
And that goes for both of you, okay?

455
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,120
How is school going?

456
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,040
Well, I'm doing my best.

457
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,000
Between work and helping at home,
I don't have much time.

458
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,600
Good. You must be grateful
to whoever has given you a place to stay.

459
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,760
- Who do you live with now?
- With Ander and his mother.

460
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,480
- And Ander is?
- A friend.

461
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,160
Mom, you met him at the hospital,
remember?

462
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,120
Oh, yes.

463
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,680
How is he?

464
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,520
He's fine.

465
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,360
What's wrong, son?

466
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,920
Don't say it's nothing. I know you.

467
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,520
The thing is... he has leukemia.

468
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,880
What? Ander?

469
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,680
I do my best to help him.

470
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,440
I go with him to his chemo sessions,
I look after him.

471
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,520
The truth is,
school isn't my priority right now.

472
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,800
Son, you're a very good boy, but...
that's not your responsibility.

473
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,280
Let his family take care of him.

474
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,200
Ander is my family.

475
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,080
His family are his parents,
his siblings...

476
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,160
He's my boyfriend, Dad.

477
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,640
What you need to do
is focus on your studies.

478
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,560
- Otherwise, you'll get in trouble.
- Did you hear me, Dad?

479
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,440
You're a very smart boy,
and if you focus, you can...

480
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,080
- Did you hear me?
- Did you hear <i>me?</i>

481
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,200
I'm sorry, but I...
I can't do this.

482
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,920
I'm sorry, Mom.

483
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,240
Lía, honey, you brought champagne!
Thanks.

484
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,440
So good to see you. Thank you.

485
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,776
- What about the booze? You brought some?
- It's over there.

486
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,480
Perfect. I love the outfit. It's amazing.

487
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,520
Who invited you two? Where's the booze?

488
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,440
Hi.

489
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,720
No, we can't allow that here.

490
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,080
Go to the nearest store
and bring some alcohol, okay?

491
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,200
Bye!

492
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,440
Ugh.

493
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,640
Good God, look who's here.
You look stunning.

494
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,960
- Thank you. So do you.
- Thanks.

495
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,440
- You're enjoying it, aren't you?
- It's nothing I haven't seen already.

496
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,880
- More than enough times.
- I thought as much.

497
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,160
Wow, wow! I'm blown away. I love it.

498
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,280
I just don't remember hiring a magician.

499
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,800
I think table three
just asked for the check.

500
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,120
We were talking about
how genius this party is, right, Rebe?

501
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,880
- Uh-huh.
- Leave the bottle over there.

502
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,400
- Thanks, hon.
- Thank <i>you.</i>

503
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,560
I'd say that it takes one genius
to appreciate another.

504
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,440
But tonight, we're judging you
based solely on your appearance.

505
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,400
- You look amazing.
- Thanks, babe.

506
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,280
And you should smile a bit more, okay?

507
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,880
- You look handsome but too serious.
- What's next?

508
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,400
You'll slap our asses
and harass us on the dance floor?

509
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,080
- Hey, Samu?
- How are you, man?

510
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,360
- Great.
- Yes,

511
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,760
- and you should take it as a compliment.
- Okay.

512

513
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,320
This is a cool party.

00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,640
- You know. Me and my ideas.
<i>- ♪ We're moving on, we're moving on... ♪</i>

515
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,160
Polo, Caye, I'm in my house.
Um, well, my former house.

516
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,320
The party looks pretty good.

520
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,600

- Yeah, but I don't think I'll stay long.

521
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,240
Give me a second.

522
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,400
You know this is a reverse theme party.

523
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,640
Why don't you go "home"
and read a fucking book?

524
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,720
I don't believe you.

525
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,400
You're the most persistent competitor
there ever was.

526
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,440
Do you seriously still want to be
with Guzmán?

527
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,760
- It's not a good night to be alone.
- It never is for you.

528
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,120
This is such a great party.

529
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,280
Balloons, projectors,
people bringing their own drinks...

530
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,400
How much did this cost you?
Ten euros?

531
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,360
Bullshit! I'm out of here.
This party sucks.

532
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,120
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

534
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,880

- It looks like it.

535
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,720

537
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:27,520
Hi! You didn't understand
the dress code either, right?

538
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,200
- The roles are reversed.
- It looks like we're not the only ones.

539
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,240
Hm? I see. Excuse me.

Should I resend you the invitation
so you get the idea?

542
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,000
I'm sorry, Lu.
I will always be a refined lady.

543
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,080
Uh, sure...

544
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,600
Where do I leave this shit?

545
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,560
Right here's fine.

546
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,080
She's so classy.

547
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,600
Pathetic.

548
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,720
Darling, we're leaving soon.

549
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,920
I don't want to see you
more than strictly necessary either.

550
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,280
Right.

551
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,560
Well...

552
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,880
- Let's enjoy the party.
- Yeah, let's.

553
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,200
- To us.
- Cheers.

555
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,400
Your turn.

556
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,200
I can't do it, Nadia.

557
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,080
I can't.

558
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,600
You have to lie.

559
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,760

591

Why?

615
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,040
For making a scene. It worked.

616
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,320
- You are stubborn.
- I am.

617
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,840
- Too proud.
- That too.

618
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,280
- But you're also a good friend.
- I didn't do it to be your friend.

619
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,760
I did it...

620
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,600
because I love you.

621
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,440
And... do you love me? You love me...

622
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,920
don't you?

00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,680
But that's not enough.

626

Everything's so easy

627
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,280
He makes my family so happy.

628
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,040
I could have a future with him.

629
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,160
I couldn't with you.

630
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,800
Love isn't enough.

631
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Hey.

632
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,400
What are you doing here?

633
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,640
Nothing.

634
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,200
I came to apologize.

635
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,760
And to see how sexy you looked.

636
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,160
It's okay, don't worry.

637
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,000
- Omar.
- What?

638
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,440
- Everything's okay.
- No, it's not fucking okay.

639
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,120
I'm really messed up,

640
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,720
but the only one
I treat like shit is you...

641
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,440
because I know
you'll be there, no matter what.

642
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,200
No matter how much I push you away,
you'll come back.

643
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,960
And that's not fair. You don't deserve it.

644
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,840
You deserve to be loved.

645
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,800
Will you forgive me?

646
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,800
I won't.

647
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,840
Wow, so you do know
how to smile and everything.

648
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,200
How do you want me to act, Rebe?

649
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,000
Someone I care about
threw their life away for that shit.

650
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,720
Samuel... Samuel, look at me, please.

651
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,920
What?

652
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,800
If I have to choose
between you and the cash...

653
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,120
then we'll flush that shit
down the toilet right away.

654
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,520
Look at me, being all romantic.

655
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,480
After saying something that romantic,
we could at least kiss or...

656
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,480
Um, hi.

657
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,160
Hi.

658
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,240
How are you?

659
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,920
- Fine. And you?
- Fine.

660
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,240
- This is Ander. Malick.
- Hey, how are you?

661
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,840
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

662
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,080
You look amazing.

663
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,920
But you didn't hear about the dress code,
did you?

664
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,760
I feel a little out of place,
especially seeing you two like that.

665
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,160
- Well, you know what to do.
- What? No. No way.

666
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,760
Oh, yes way.
You just have to undo this button...

667
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:50,320
Well, I see you got to know each other.

668
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,920
- Come on! Take it off, take it off!
- Take it off!

669
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,800
Don't be shy, honey!

670
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,520
Come on! That's it!

671
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,400
Um...

672
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I found out.

673
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,320
And I'm really sorry.

674
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,040
I'm here for you if you need anything.

675
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,960
Don't worry about it. I'm okay.

676
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,120
Of course I'm worried.
We're family, right?

677
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:35,720
I can't believe
your own sister kicked you out.

678
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,400
- I mean...
- Well...

679
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,200
I didn't exactly get kicked out.
I left voluntarily.

680
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,360
- Okay.
- She's been acting a bit crazy

681
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,040
since my dad cut her off.

682
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,440
- What?
- No.

683
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,800
- Your dad did what?
- No.

684
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,560
She doesn't have a cent to her name.

685
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,640
- Holy shit.
- I don't believe it.

686
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,240
That's what this whole party was about.
People had to bring their own drinks.

687
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,240
She's so smart, I'm in awe!

688
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,520
- The party was cool anyway.
- Sure.

689
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,960
I wanted to go, you know?

690
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,160
With my see-through top...

691
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,040
I looked great.

692
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:15,960
I'd have liked to look at you guys
the way you look at girls, you know?

693
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,120
We can fix that.

694
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,560
You can look at us however you want.

695
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,320
Right, Polo?

696
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,640
True.

697
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,720
In fact, tonight...

698
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,280
you're in charge.

699
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,040
- I'm in charge?
- Yes, you are.

700
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,440
Whatever you want.

701
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,920
- Mm, okay.
- Your wish is our command.

702
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,080
Kiss each other.

703
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,120
- Just like that?
- Yes.

704
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,800
- Come here.
<i>- ♪ A kiss, a word, a fight ♪</i>

705
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,280
Slowly, so we can enjoy it longer.

706
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,000
<i>♪ You, darkness, light... ♪</i>

707
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,560
Polo, undress him slowly.

708
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:04,280
<i>♪ Forever, forever, the fear ♪</i>

709
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,920
<i>♪ A kiss, a word, a fight ♪</i>

710
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,360
<i>- ♪ You, darkness ♪</i>
- Go down.

711
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,120
<i>- ♪ Light ♪</i>
- Go down.

712
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,800
<i>♪ Me, forever, fear ♪</i>

713
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,920
<i>- ♪ Forever, forever, the fear ♪</i>
- Down.

714
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,880
<i>♪ A kiss, a word, a fight ♪</i>

715
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,000

716
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,640

725
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,760
I didn't tell you earlier...
but you look amazing.

726
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,560
I know.

727
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,320
Thanks.

728
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,360
Shall we dance?

729
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,720
No.

730
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,640
I'm fine like this.

731
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,720
To us.

732
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,400
Cheers!

733
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,160
- Rebeca, do you have a moment?
- Yes. Yes, of course.

734
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,000
I persuaded the teachers
and board members to allow you to stay.

735
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,440
Thank you.

736
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,080
Having said that,

737
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:45,120
I need to remind you we are very strict
with the monthly payments

738
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,080
and the payment deadlines.

739
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,160
And this month...

740
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,760
Damn. The fine print.

741
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,120
Be careful.
If we don't receive the payments,

742
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,080
- I'll have no option but...
- Yes.

743
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,480
You'll have an awesome excuse
to kick me out.

744
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,160
We already talked about this!

745
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,880
Samuel, either I sell those bundles,
or they'll kick me out.

746
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,920
And, man,
I'm tired of them getting their way.

747
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Fine, start dealing.
But remember how those guys reacted

748
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:15,600
- when we invaded their turf?
- Hey, hey, hey. Shh!

749
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,680
Relax.

750
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,000
I know somewhere with no competition.

751
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,120
Where the market is huge.

752
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:23,920
Where?

753
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:26,880
Las Encinas.

754
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,840
You have got to be kidding me.

755
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,920
Lu, do you have a minute?

756
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,840
- It depends.
- I just wanted to...

757
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,800
ask you to treat Cayetana better.

758
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,600
Just sort of leave her alone a bit.
Leave her alone, basically.

759
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,080
Anything else? I'm in a hurry.

760
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:53,320
Well, since you're asking, yeah.
Make sure everyone leaves us alone. Hm?

761
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,200
You're good at that.
They'll listen to you.

762
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:59,080
Why would I do that, Polito?

763
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,680
- My name is Polo, not Polito.
- Whatever.

764
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,520
And because the Columbia scholarship
is sponsored by my mothers.

765
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,200
And if I recall correctly,
I don't think you can afford to lose it.

766
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,560
- What?
- Yeah.

767
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,640
Since your father left you with nothing.

768
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Was it you?

769
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,480
Did you kill him?

770
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,920
No.

771
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:31,560
We know each other better
than either of us would like to, Lucrecia.

772
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,040
And I think you're lying to me.

773
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,120
Tell me the truth.

774
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:41,000
Why are you so shaken up? What's wrong?

775
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,000
I'm shaken up because I saw who did it.

776
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,840
