1
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,960
- Still in bed? Are you okay?
- Yes.

2
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,680
My head hurts a little,
but I'm starting to feel better.

3
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,400
- Your room looks like a pigsty.
- I'll clean it.

4
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,760
No, no, come and have breakfast.
I'll have Mirella do it.

5
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,880
- Everything okay?
- Of course.

6
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,360
If you're not even gonna try to hide it,
at least tell me the truth.

7
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,080
I'm just wonderful, Samuel.
Is that better?

8
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,480
Is there anyone sitting here? No?

9
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,880
Well, there is now. Me.

10
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,096
Good day, ladies and gentlemen.

11
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,640
I hope you've given it your all
for these finals.

12
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,320
It's important
you tell us everything you have seen.

13
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,800
Anything that you think could be useful.

14
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,640
Everything. Any detail could be key.

15
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,560
What the fuck?

16
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,160
I don't know any of this shit.

17
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
Wake up.

18
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,800
What do you want?
I don't like you out of your seats.

19
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,880
I have a question.
There's an issue with one of the problems.

20
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,680
Look. You can't do the ionic bonding
between sodium and chlorine

21
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,200
because sodium's atomic number
is incorrect.

22
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
Hey.

23
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,560
You owe me an A.

24
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,880
I don't expect a standing ovation,
but a thank-you would be nice.

25
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,440
"Thank you," bitch?

26
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,000
Thank you...

27
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,040
but you shouldn't have risked it.
You didn't need to.

28
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,880
You're not okay.

29
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,800
I have an MA in interpreting
passive-aggressive behavior.

30
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,920
Let's see.

31
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,200
You're crying out for help.

32
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,960
Can you tell me what's going on?

33
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,440
Guess who finally got themselves
a big house...

34
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,520
fit for a party
to celebrate the end of finals? Who?

35
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,040
Who cares?

36
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,200
It'll be your project, baby.

37
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,440
Why me?

38
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,280
The house is for the two of us
to enjoy this summer.

39
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,720
The sooner you make it feel like your own,
the better.

40
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,800
Lucky me.

41
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,760
- Are you being sarcastic?
- She's being herself, darling.

42
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,680
Meet the worst version of Carla.

43
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,160
You should accept her
and love her so much.

44
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,760
Good luck.

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Call me.

46
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,040
I don't know.

47
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,840
Any girl would kill to have...

48
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,960
everything I'm offering you,
and you don't seem very excited.

49
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,920
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,880
It's just that...
I didn't sleep well last night.

51
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,080
- I see.
- But everything's fine, okay?

52
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,760
You worry too much.

53
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,760
<i>What is it?</i>

54
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,320
Look, I'm not trying to avoid
taking the blame for this.

55
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,560
As if you could do that.

56
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,520
Look, Malick liking guys
and cheating on me...

57
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,560
is something I can't control.

58
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,280
But the fact that he cheated with you...

59
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,440
Did you ever stop to think about me?

60
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,520
Do you have so little respect for me?

61
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,920
I clearly wasn't thinking about you
when I did it.

62
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,400
Or about Ander or anybody else.
I needed to do it, and I did it, period.

63
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Great.

64
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,040
- Fantastic.
- Yes, Nadia.

65
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,120
I make mistakes, I trip up,
I lie, and I disappoint people.

66
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,520
Like everyone else.

67
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,840
- Even you.
- What?

68
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,840
You haven't told Mom and Dad
that Malick likes guys, have you?

69
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,040
Ah.

70
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,680
So you haven't thought about them.
Only about yourself and New York.

71
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,440
There you go. We all have our faults.

72
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,280
Gay,

73
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
a cheater,

74
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,680
and involved with my brother.

75
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,280
What a catch!

76
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,160
God, I can't wait for this year to be over
so I can get away from Las Encinas.

77
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,680
You can achieve
anything you put your mind to.

78
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,840
You will get out of here, for sure.
And I will miss you so much.

79
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,360
- Don't go near her again.
- Why?

80
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,080
'Cause she's not okay! Can't you tell?

81
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,200
Easy. I'm taking care of her happiness.
And I'm giving her a good price.

82
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,240
- Let go.
- You got Rebeca into this.

83
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,400
- I won't let you do it to Carla too.
- Did they ask for your help?

84
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,800
As far as I know, those two girls
want you to stay away from them.

85
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,880
I want you out of my house this afternoon.

86
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,040
COLUMBIA PROGRAM GRANT RECIPIENT
SOON

87
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,760
YOU ARE INVITED TO OUR POOL PARTY!

88
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,920
Oh, please.

89
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,720
Hello.

90
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,080
Happy?

91
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,480
Out of everyone who didn't deserve
to win the scholarship, it's only you...

92
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,320
who I'm not ashamed to lose to.

93
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,120
Well played. Congratulations.

94
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,880
Nadia!

95
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,240
It'll be fine. You'll see.

96
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,680
- Shouldn't <i>I </i>be giving <i>you </i>moral support?
- You had nightmares all night.

97
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,080
Don't say it'll be fine.
It's bad luck.

98
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,840
I'll shut up.

99
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,400
My therapist used to say
it's best to always imagine the worst.

100
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,800
That way, you can see
that the worst isn't that bad.

101
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,320
That was back when the worst
wasn't croaking.

102
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,000
Yeah...
when I used to get anxious over grades.

103
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,600
Oh, my God.

104
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,800
What's the worst
that could happen in there?

105
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,640
If the doctor looks at your file
and says, "Oh... almost."

106
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,360
"How wonderful, Ander.

107
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,480
You'll make all those families waiting
for an organ donor so happy."

108
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,680
Pfft. "You're cured, Ramón.

109
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,000
Oh, sorry, this isn't your file.
This one's yours."

110
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,360
Okay, that's enough.

111
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,080
Ander, the doctor will see you now.

112
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
It'll be okay.

113
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,400
Fuck you.

114
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,640
I don't have good news.

115
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,040
The results of your bone marrow biopsy
and the CT scan...

116
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,840
are not what we were expecting.

117
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,440
The ratio of lymphoblasts
is still much higher than 30%.

118
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,000
What does that mean?

119
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,200
For the time being,
we will have to continue with chemotherapy

120
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,640
and increase the intensity.

121
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,200
- For how long?
- As long as we need to.

122
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,880
Until we get results.

123
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,480
What if we don't get results?

124
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,320
Let's not imagine the worst, hm?

125
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,360
So, you decide to destroy school property
on the last day of finals?

126
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,920
- Well done.
- What can they do?

127
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,880
Expel you when graduation
is just three days away, loser.

128
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,840
I don't give a shit!

129
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,440
What?

130
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,000
Just what you need. A good party.

131
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,480
Among other things,
but we'll start with that.

132
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,520
- I'm not going.
- What do you mean?

133
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,240
- Aren't you going to tell me why?
- I don't need to.

134
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,800
I don't owe you shit.
You and I are not friends.

135
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,840
- What are we, then?
- We were accomplices.

136
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,560
Shitty ones at that.

137
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,520
We wanted to make his life hell,
and that asshole's as happy as can be.

138
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,360
I mean, he can't kick you out
just because he feels like it.

139
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,560
- You could sue him. It's illegal.
- I could if I had a contract.

140
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,960
- Why did he do it?
- I told you, roommate issues.

141
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,040
He saw us together.

142
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,400
- When?
- The blackout party.

143
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,160
He knows I care about you.

144
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,160
- That's why he wants to hurt you.
- I don't want to live with him either.

145
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,080
Yeah, okay. Where will you live, then?

146
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,120
I don't know. I'll think of something.
It's not my first rodeo.

147
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,160
Amazing.

148
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,200
We turn his living room into a drug depot,
and he doesn't say a thing.

149
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,400
But if you sell to the chick he likes,
he blows a fuse.

150
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,560
I'm going to stop.

151
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,720
Stop what?

152
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,520
- I don't want to do this anymore.
- No way.

153
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,720
You didn't see him.

154
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,080
Samuel could rat me out.
He'd ruin my school year,

155
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,520
just when I'm doing well
for the first time ever!

156
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,120
- He won't tell.
- I hate it. I want to go to London.

157
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,280
I have some really good things going on.

158
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,840
What is it that everyone sees
in Little Miss Marchioness?

159
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,520
She's a viper.
If she bit her own tongue, she'd die.

160
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,720
Fuck!

161
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,360
But somehow, she has everyone
eating out of her fucking hand.

162
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,800
But losers like me...

163
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,000
all we get is a slap in the face.

164
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,240
We're not doing this.

165
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,440
We're not closing the business.
We're going all out.

166
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,720
More than ever.

167
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,960
We'll make a killing
at Yeray's pool party.

168
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,080
I'll pass.

169
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,040
Don't you need money to go to London?

170
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,080
Leave me alone.

171
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,240
What happened isn't Valerio's fault.

172
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,480
He shouldn't have to pay for what I did.

173
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,280
Let him stay at your house,
at least until he finds someplace else.

174
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,560
And why would I do that?

175
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,120
Because I could tell Azucena
you almost punched a student.

176
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,800
You'll get expelled,
and you'll have to repeat the grade.

177
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,760
Is that what you want?

178
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,400
Then I'll tell her
why I almost smashed his face in.

179
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,360
Because he's a fucking drug pusher
who's dealing here at school.

180
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,840
He'll probably get expelled too,

181
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,240
but he'll repeat the grade
in fucking prison.

182
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,920
That's not true.

183
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,200
So, you didn't know
he was dealing to Carla either?

184
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,240
I guess you haven't noticed
she's been acting like a zombie for weeks.

185
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,600
I suppose she needs that shit
to get through the day.

186
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,520
- What the hell are you saying?
- But I don't.

187
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,960
I get by on my hatred for you.
I hate you for so many reasons.

188
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,760
One of them is you'll be leaving

189
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,080
without giving a fuck about all the pain
that you're leaving behind.

190
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,520
Get out of here.

191
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,720
I'm off.
I'm meeting up with Yeray.

192
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,720
Mwah!

193
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,280
- Is everything all right?
- Everything's perfect.

194
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,280
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

195
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,400
And I'm very proud of you.

196
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,240
Of how your attitude's improved,

197
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,120
of how you're listening to us,
and of how you've grown up.

198
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,000
- Aw.
- You're a woman now.

199
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,360
No, a lady.

200
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,760
A marchioness.

201
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,120
Gorgeous.

202
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,400
Have fun.

203
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,440
Fuck, you're so annoying.
Drop it already, please!

204
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,600
Just say...

205
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,720
"Mom, I haven't left the business
because I like living the good life,

206
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,840
and I shouldn't have trusted Samuel."
Say it, and I'll shut up.

207
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,080
See how easy it is? That's more like it.

208
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,440
Anyway, so tell me,
what did you do with him?

209
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,280
What else could I do? I got rid of him.

210
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,200
What?

211
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,640
I mean, I broke up with him.
I'm not like you, Mom.

212
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,600
Okay, baby. With that attitude of yours

213
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,320
and your willingness
to take over the business...

214
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,160
you're actually becoming a bit like me.

215
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Hm?

216
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,360
You were right after all.
I'm becoming her.

217
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,720
I need her to send someone to scare Polo.

218
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,440
- Excuse me?
- To scare the shit out of him.

219
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,960
To scare him to death.

220
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,440
- Rebeca!
- I said no.

221
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,280
Do I need to spell it out for you?
I'm never going to send anyone

222
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,120
- to go scare Polo.
- Sure, but your mom took care of that kid.

223
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,640
I'm not like my mother.

224
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,120
See if you can get that
through your thick skull, idiot.

225
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,000
Hey, honey, we're back!

226
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,960
Come in, you've already been here.

227
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,440
Let's see which room we put you in.
There are so many...

228
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,000
If you show me the way to your room,
I'll leave a trail of breadcrumbs

229
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,080
so I can find my way there and...

230
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,440
have some fun.

231
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,000
Hey, handsome.

232
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,800
Did you talk to your moms?

233
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,880
- Did they say no?
- I wanted to talk to Valerio first.

234
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,920
How did you get the money
to pay for college?

235
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,200
- I told you.
- I know what you told us,

236
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,960
but now I'd like to hear the truth.

237
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,040
It's no big deal.

238
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,640
Is that why you didn't tell us?

239
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,720
- What? Tell us what?
- He's a fucking drug dealer.

240
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,800
It's a temporary thing.
But, yes, that's how I'm making a living.

241
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,840
- Dealing drugs?
- Yes.

242
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,400
And you're selling to Carla?

243
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,160
Her money's as good as anyone else's.
Why's she any different?

244
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,120
She's not just anyone!
She's Carla, dammit!

245
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,160
She's never used drugs.

246
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,600
She's afraid of getting hooked.
She's like that.

247
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,680
She gets hooked to a perfume,
a purse, or a boy, and she can't let go.

248
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,880
People change, Polo.

249
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,680
It's been a long time
since you were with Carla.

250
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,280
- You have no idea what she's like.
- Guys, stop, please.

251
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,800
You don't know your buyers...

252
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,400
or if they can handle the shit you sell,
because you don't care.

253
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,000
You can save
your moral superiority speech.

254
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,680
You think you're better than me?

255
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,240
You're right.
I'm no better than you. I'm worse.

256
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,320
I'm probably worse.

257
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,080
The fraudster,
the murderer, and the dealer.

258
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,760
It sounds like a joke,
but it's not fucking funny!

259
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,960
- What’s wrong?
- What's wrong?

260
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,840
I just woke up, Cayetana,

261
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,680
and I don't like
what I see one fucking bit!

262
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,280
Get out.

263
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,680
Both of you. Out.

264
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,720
- Leave me alone.
- Shh, hush.

265
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,320
HOW DID IT GO?

266
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,760
I have to go to work.

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,080

They said something about a rust effect
or something like that.

271
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,680
They charged me a premium
like they would Cristiano Ronaldo.

272
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,080

273
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,160

It means that I want to get
in the pool with you, right now.

277
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,720
Get in.

278
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,840
Now?

279
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,600
Mm-hmm.

280
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,440

Well, it's a saltwater pool,
but I don't think it's really all that.

284
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,440

- Oh, yeah.

285
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,400

and when the day comes...

298
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,720
boom.

299
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,040
They tell you no.

300
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,480
That you'll be locked up,
maybe for another month, a year,

301
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,720
for ten years... or forever.

302
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,720
- But you aren't in prison.
- What?

303
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,160
You can leave whenever you want.

304
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,760
- What are you talking about?
- You can leave him, Omar.

305
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,760
That's exactly what I can't do.

306
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,040
- You can't or you wouldn't dare to?
- Are you lecturing me about bravery?

307
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,240
QUR'AN

308
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,440
- Thank you.
- In the name of Allah.

309
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,320
One of my daughters
going to college, in America...

310
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,680
Mm.

311
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,760
What's going on?

312
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,280
- Malick and I thought...
- You and Malick...?

313
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,440
Hear him out.

314
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,400
Malick and I think
it would be best if you went to America...

315
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,880
engaged to be married.

316
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,480
Did you know
what these two were planning?

317
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,200
You want that, right?

318
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,960
Just a second. Come.

319
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,520
- Was this your idea?
- No.

320
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,120
It was your father's suggestion,
and it'd be good for us.

321
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,200
Your family will leave you alone.

322
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,920
And I'll give my family what they expect,
at least on the surface.

323
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,320
If I get married now,
I'm guaranteed my freedom forever.

324
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,000
- It's a mere formality.
- No, it isn't.

325
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,040
You've seen what my parents are like.

326
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,240
For us, it's a serious,
lifelong commitment.

327
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,280
- Do you really not care about anything?
- No, it's not that.

328
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,320
I just put my happiness first.

329
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,120
And you should do the same.

330
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,480
Do you think your parents arranged
this marriage with your happiness in mind?

331
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,600
They're thinking about their happiness,
their honor, what people will say.

332
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,640
Wake up.

333
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,480
Either we keep up the charade...
or you can say goodbye to New York.

334
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,960
I don't need a pep talk to cheer me up
about the scholarship.

335
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,240
I didn't call you down here
to cheer you up. Nadia just quit.

336
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,200
She says she won't change her mind.
And since you came in second...

337
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,200
Nadia.

338
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,800
You're nuts if you think
I'll settle for your scraps.

339
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,880
I don't want to live a lie, Lu.

340
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,360
So you don't want to live a lie?

341
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,880
Well, grow some fucking ovaries

342
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,680
and tell your father you're going
to accept the scholarship and go alone.

343
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,640
Because you don't need a man
or anyone else, Nadia.

344
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,280
Be the woman who managed to beat me!
The one I admire, dammit!

345
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,040
The one I can't stand.

346
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,680
I meant to say, "the one I can't stand."

347
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,440
Because I can't stand you.

348
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,880
Okay?

349
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,560
People are staring.

350
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,400
Hey, guys, gals, and everyone!

351
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,200
Our suffering is over!

352
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,160
Finals are over!

353
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,120
No more uniforms!

354
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,000
Let's party!

355
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,720
<i>♪ Don't call me no names ♪</i>

356
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,440

366
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,240
People are going wild.

367
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,760
Really? That's great!

368
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,920
- Are you coming?
- In a minute.

369
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,960
<i>♪ Names, names ♪</i>

370
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,840

371
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,720
Hold on. Let me help you.

372
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,480
- There's no need.
- Grab that end.

373
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,320
You'll be more comfortable downstairs.

374
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,960
Omar and I will take turns sleeping
with you in case you need anything.

375
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,760
COMING TO THE PARTY? I WANT TO SEE YOU.

376
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,800
IT'LL BE NICE TO GET OUT OF PRISON.

377
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,480
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK, OMAR.
YOU CAN LEAVE HIM.

378
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,880
- What do you want?
- To drag you to that party.

379
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,040
Fuck. I have nothing to celebrate.

380
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,320
Of course you do.

381
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,160
The end of the exams and the fact
that we're alive. Is that not enough?

382
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,040
Ander is sick. Really sick.

383
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,480
Chemo could kill him before cancer.

384
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,176
- You forgave Polo because of Ander?
- I didn't forgive him.

385
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,040
- You've moved on.
- I never will.

386
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,480
Have fun at the party with him.
I'm not going.

387
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,520
Listen, Samu.
I used to think about him day and night.

388
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,280
And you know what I realized?

389
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,240
If I can't put him behind bars,
I don't want him in my fucking head.

390
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,880
He doesn't deserve to be that important.

391
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,040
Think about it.

392
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,280
What's wrong, honey?

393
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,480
Malick and I aren't together.

394
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,080
What?

395
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,640
But we weren't together...

396
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,160
the last two years either,

397
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,920
and, as you know, I passed...

398
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,720
with the best grades.

399
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,000
I didn't need him...

400
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,840
or anyone else.

401
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,200
Just me and my own hard work.

402
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,120
I want to go to New York.

403
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,680
No, sorry...

404
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,000
I <i>am </i>going to New York.

405
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,640
- No.
- Dad!

406
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,560
Listen to me.

407
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,520
Just this once.

408
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,480
Please.

409
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,880
I'm no longer the girl
you want me to be.

410
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,400
I haven't been for a long time.

411
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,200
I wish I were...

412
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,520
because everything would be easier...

413
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,760
and I would still believe that...

414
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,920
everything you do is for my protection...

415
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,040
not because you're afraid to lose me...

416
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,000
like you lost Omar...

417
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
and May.

418
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,920
I swear to you...

419
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,320
if I go to New York,

420
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,680
I will always come back.

421
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,360
You will always have me.

422
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,360
But... if you stand in my way...

423
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,120
Thank God you're here.

424
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,960
- I ran out.
- Of what?

425
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,040
I didn't bring any with me.

426
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,400
Okay, fine.

427
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,200
You're here to make a killing.
Do you think I'm dumb?

428
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,160
- Drink champagne, it's better for you.
- No, thanks.

429
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,520
- Okay.
- Wait.

430
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,800
What do you want? More money?

431
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,240
How much?

432
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,440
I know those cravings well.

433
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,960
I'm sorry, but I won't sell to you.
In fact, I never should have sold to you.

434
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,240
Carla. Carla, darling.

435
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,040
Today is your lucky day.

436
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,000
- It is?
- Yeah.

437
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,640
Two grams for 90 bucks. Just for you.

438
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,160
Right in your pocket,
where you've got everyone.

439
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:47,480
- The offer ends in ten, nine, eight...
- I thought you didn't deal.

440
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,720
Don't think so much, honey.

441
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,120
There you go. Enjoy.

442
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,640
Carla, what are you doing?

443
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:07,960
What's that?

444
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,360
Mm...

445
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,560
Molly. Want some?

446
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,360
- Now you're taking Molly?
- Didn't you want to live large?

447
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,920
This is the full experience.

448
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,080
Full experience?
Don't treat me like an idiot.

449
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,680
I know how that makes you feel.
It's great until you get the comedown.

450
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,840
It makes you depressed.
It takes you ages to be yourself again.

451
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,120
Dude, you sound
like a Health Department PSA.

452
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,480
I get enough lectures from my father.

453
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,240
You should listen to me.

454
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,600
- Come on, you'll get totally loved up.
- What? Loved...

455
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,600
Sorry.

456
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,520
I'm sorry.

457
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,160
Don't ruin my party, please.

458
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,440
I was just trying to be
the coolest girlfriend.

459
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,600
Isn't that what you wanted?

460
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,920
So, Lu, how is your first day
as a loser going?

461
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,240
Fucking awesome. I'm actually doing great.

462
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,120
I don't need that scholarship.

463
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,520
I mean, I only applied for it out of...

464
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,920
Well, for the competition. You know me.
And my résumé.

465
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,920
I can go to any university I want.

466
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,560
And my father will pay for it.
Thanks, I'll order another one soon.

467
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,600
Why is that your fifth gin and tonic?

468
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,560
Are you trying to forget
how little you care about losing?

469
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,920
Cheers, then.

470
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,680
Sure, cheers.

471
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,440
Hi.

472
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,680
- Nadia!
- Hi.

473
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,320
You take the concept of the burkini
to a new level.

474
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,440
I'm in a hurry, Lu.

475
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:45,480
I need you to sign this so I can take it
to the school office before it closes.

476
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,160
What is it?

477
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,000
Azucena will let us share the scholarship.

478
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,120
But the budget remains the same.

479
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,840
So we will each have to get by
with half the money

480
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,400
for food, accommodation...

481
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,120
I'm used to scraping by, but you...

482
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,680
Do you think
I'm going to let you laugh in my face?

483
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,280
Come on, stop being so you and sign it.

484
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,120
Thank you.

485
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
My pleasure.

486
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,640

Where does that leave us?

497
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,400
You'll be here, and I'm leaving.

498
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,800

what I'm feeling right now.

515
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,920
It's as if electricity was flowing
through every pore in my body.

516
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,600
Let's take a selfie. You like that.

520
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,640
I don't need chemicals to be happy.

521
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,320
You're all I need.

522
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,480
Shame you can't say the same.

523
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,280
Come on, it doesn't matter.

524
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,120
Some of us need a bit of help
to let our hair down.

525
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,360
What's wrong with that?

526
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,400
Your life is perfect.

527
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,280
I don't get why you need to take anything.

528
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,480
Oh, darling...

529
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,720
you're kind of a pain in the ass,
you know?

530
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,680
Maybe I need to get high
just to put up with you.

531
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,640
With me?

532
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,480
Yes, you, your prescheduled life,

533
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,320
the fact I'm sentenced to five years
with you

534
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,760
because you're signing that contract
with my father.

535
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,960
But I accept that you're locking me up
in this palace with a pool, honey.

536
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,640
That contract is just business.
It has nothing to do with us.

537
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,520
Each plan you make with me
feels like another nail in my coffin.

Okay. Let me dry off a little.

550
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,640
No, it has to be now.

551
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,560
Do you love him?

552
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,560
How many times have you fucked?

553
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,600
Once.

554
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,240
Three... or four.
It depends on what counts as fucking.

555
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,960
Was it just sex?

556
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,960
No, it wasn’t just sex.

557
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,920
Are you in love with him?

558
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,520
I don't know.

559
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,840
- You are or you aren't.
- I don't know what being in love is.

560
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,320
I just know I'm crazy about him.

561
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,800
And how does he feel about you?

562
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,280
The same way, I guess.

563
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,200
Because being at your place, by your side,

564
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,760
it's hard on him.

565
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,400
Don't tell him about this, okay?

566
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,880
The only bathing suit I have
with no holes in it is here.

567
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,200
Sure.

568
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,160
You forgot how to sew?

569
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,120
Don't do this, Polo.

570
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,080
Don't do this.

571
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,440
This is the start of something good.

572
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,000
Something worthwhile.

573
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,560
Are we really going
to just throw all that away?

574
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,240
Just like that?

575
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,160
I'm sorry.

576
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,640
I shouldn't have taken it out on you.

577
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:16,480
- My problem is with Valerio.
- What he did was wrong, okay?

578
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,320
Whatever happened to
"everyone deserves a second chance"?

579
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,680
Where the hell were you?

580
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,240
You could at least answer
one fucking message, right?

581
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,120
We need to talk.

582
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,280
So?

583
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,720
I've been with Alexis.

584
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,280
I'm with Alexis. I have been for a while.

585
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,120
What?

586
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,280
I should have told you weeks ago.

587
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,040
But with the tests and all that...

588
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,640
Now it doesn't matter.

589
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,560
Omar, I don't have time to waste.

590
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,520
I want to end this.

591
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,280
Are you kidding me?

592
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,600
He gets me.

593
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,080
We speak the same language.

594
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,680
The language of cancer.

595
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,960
You don't.

596
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,440
No. It's not true. No way.

597
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,120
Why do you think I told you
to hook up with other guys?

598
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,280
I felt guilty about cheating on you.

599
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,320
So, do you fuck him?

600
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,720
Cheating isn't just about fucking.

601
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,240
It's about wanting to be with him,
talk to him...

602
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,880
I'm sorry.

603
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,400
What do I do now?

604
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,880
I don't know.

605
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,800
I'm not going to lie to you.
The sooner you go, the better.

606
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,160
Samuel will let you stay
at his place, right?

607
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,600
We can talk about it tomorrow. I'm tired.

608
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,800
And that's it?

609
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,360
You son of a bitch.

610
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,600

- Business.

But putting assholes in jail
sounds pretty good too.
