1
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:50,074
Life was given to
us a billion years ago.

2
00:01:51,221 --> 00:01:53,077
What have we done with it?

3
00:02:10,365 --> 00:02:13,041
Lucy. It's easy as pie.

4
00:02:13,147 --> 00:02:16,224
- In and out, all done and dusted.
- And why don't you do it yourself?

5
00:02:16,328 --> 00:02:20,104
The last thing the guy's expecting is a
total 10 turning up to deliver the case.

6
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:23,107
- It'll blow his mind. Come on!
- What's in it?

7
00:02:23,335 --> 00:02:26,902
Sweetheart!
Don't get paranoid on me, all right?

8
00:02:27,006 --> 00:02:28,612
You trust me, don't you?

9
00:02:34,264 --> 00:02:35,494
Fuck!

10
00:02:37,684 --> 00:02:41,625
Richard, I really do like you. But...

11
00:02:41,855 --> 00:02:44,336
I have to take care of
myself right now. I gotta...

12
00:02:45,316 --> 00:02:47,673
I don't know. I've got to
concentrate on so many things.

13
00:02:47,777 --> 00:02:50,050
Hey, hey. What are you doing?

14
00:02:50,155 --> 00:02:52,428
I'm going home, because
I have exams on Monday.

15
00:02:52,532 --> 00:02:55,598
I have to shower and I
have to study, okay?

16
00:02:55,702 --> 00:02:57,933
You know what? The other day,
I was in this museum.

17
00:02:58,038 --> 00:03:00,102
- And you know what I found out?
- What?

18
00:03:00,206 --> 00:03:02,563
The first ever woman was named Lucy.

19
00:03:07,464 --> 00:03:11,488
- Is that supposed to make me feel better?
- Yeah. No.

20
00:03:11,593 --> 00:03:14,992
- I'll call you. Okay?
- Okay, okay, okay.

21
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,662
I'll be honest with you.
I can't deliver the case myself.

22
00:03:18,767 --> 00:03:21,471
I had a little falling-out with the guy.
It's nothing major,

23
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:26,503
but if it's you, problem solved. You walk
in there, you go up to the reception,

24
00:03:26,608 --> 00:03:29,757
you ask for Mr. Jang to come down.
He comes down, he takes the case,

25
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:32,843
you flash him your prettiest
smile and bounce.

26
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,264
Look! You can even see
the reception from here.

27
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:39,433
Come on.

28
00:03:39,662 --> 00:03:42,602
- What's in the case?
- I don't know, it's just some paperwork.

29
00:03:42,706 --> 00:03:43,687
Yeah? Let's see it then.

30
00:03:43,792 --> 00:03:46,898
It's locked. And only
Mr. Jang has the code.

31
00:03:47,002 --> 00:03:48,901
I'm just the delivery boy.

32
00:03:49,506 --> 00:03:51,946
- Do you get paid to do this?
- Yeah, kind of.

33
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,802
Like how much?

34
00:03:54,593 --> 00:03:56,283
Okay! We are negotiating now or...

35
00:03:56,428 --> 00:03:58,911
No, no. How much do you get paid?
I want to know how much.

36
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,247
A thousand dollars.

37
00:04:01,351 --> 00:04:05,167
You get paid a thousand dollars
for delivering paperwork? Really?

38
00:04:05,271 --> 00:04:08,003
I don't know. It takes me 10
minutes and they pay me a grand

39
00:04:08,108 --> 00:04:09,212
and the rest is none of my business.

40
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:11,006
Well, it's none of my business either,
I'll tell you now.

41
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:12,675
- Listen!
- What?

42
00:04:13,612 --> 00:04:15,635
We split it down the middle. Hmm?

43
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:18,389
That's 500 for you, and 500 for me.

44
00:04:18,493 --> 00:04:21,725
- Richard, I will call you.
- Listen, it's the third time this week,

45
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,603
I'm showing up in the same hotel,
with the same cowboy hat.

46
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:25,813
Oh.

47
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,190
Problem solved!

48
00:04:28,294 --> 00:04:29,608
Go, go. I'll wait for you. Go.

49
00:04:29,713 --> 00:04:34,321
Lucy, honey... I've done this
a dozen times. It's paperwork.

50
00:04:34,426 --> 00:04:36,699
It's probably just some designs they
switched so they can copy them.

51
00:04:36,803 --> 00:04:40,327
That's how it works in this country.
Even my Stetson was made here. Look.

52
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,955
Says so on the label,
"Made in Taiwan."

53
00:04:44,811 --> 00:04:47,459
So long, cowboy with the fake Stetson.

54
00:04:47,564 --> 00:04:48,543
Baby, please.

55
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:50,337
Richard,
I got to go. And seriously...

56
00:04:50,817 --> 00:04:52,298
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

57
00:04:52,402 --> 00:04:57,052
- I'm so sorry. I really need your help.
- Stop! Stop it! Take this off me right now!

58
00:04:57,157 --> 00:04:58,386
- I can't.
- Take this off me right now!

59
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,347
I can't, Mr. Jang's the
only one who has the key.

60
00:05:00,452 --> 00:05:02,641
All you have to do is go into the hotel
and ask for him at the reception.

61
00:05:02,746 --> 00:05:05,436
- No! Take it off me right now!
- I'm so sorry. I really have no choice.

62
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,270
The sooner you go in,
the sooner you'll be back out!

63
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:10,816
- I can't believe you did this to me.
- I'll be right here. You have my word.

64
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,863
- Your word isn't worth shit!
- It's worth 500 bucks, up front.

65
00:05:16,342 --> 00:05:18,406
- You're an asshole.
- And you're wonderful.

66
00:05:37,864 --> 00:05:41,387
- Miss, may I help you?
- Uh, yes.

67
00:05:43,578 --> 00:05:45,184
I'm here for, uh...

68
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:47,686
Mr. Jang.

69
00:05:48,707 --> 00:05:50,189
Yes, um...

70
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,489
Who should I say is here?

71
00:05:59,718 --> 00:06:01,033
Richard.

72
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,328
Um, Richard sent me.

73
00:06:08,645 --> 00:06:09,792
What is your name?

74
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:12,044
No, Richard.

75
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:17,049
Richard's... He's just
looking for a place to park.

76
00:06:24,369 --> 00:06:26,141
Mr. Jang still wants
to know your name.

77
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,356
- Lucy.
- Lucy what?

78
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:36,902
Just Lucy. If he could be quick,
because I have to...

79
00:06:37,257 --> 00:06:39,363
Just a second while I translate.

80
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,830
Mr. Jang is on his way.
Stay right here.

81
00:06:49,269 --> 00:06:50,583
Can I sit?

82
00:06:50,687 --> 00:06:55,044
Mr. Jang said you need to stay right here.
I think it's better if you stay right here.

83
00:06:55,442 --> 00:06:58,549
Excuse me. Regent Hotel.

84
00:07:18,423 --> 00:07:20,612
No!

85
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:33,459
No!

86
00:07:39,985 --> 00:07:41,717
Please. Please!

87
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,018
Please! I don't know anything!

88
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,479
I don't know anything!
Please! Please!

89
00:08:23,196 --> 00:08:25,636
No! Please!

90
00:08:32,037 --> 00:08:33,455
Hmm.

91
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:05,174
Do you speak English?

92
00:09:29,261 --> 00:09:30,491
Lucy! Yes, I'm Lucy.

93
00:09:30,929 --> 00:09:34,871
This has just been a terrible mistake.
I'm just supposed to deliver this case.

94
00:09:35,727 --> 00:09:37,832
If you lost the key, you don't
have to chop off my hand.

95
00:09:37,936 --> 00:09:40,002
You can just cut the chain, okay?

96
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:46,759
Please. I'm begging you, please.

97
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:51,346
No, no, no!

98
00:09:57,498 --> 00:10:00,564
Please. Please!

99
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,580
Hello, miss. I speak
English. I translate for Mr. Jang.

100
00:10:24,651 --> 00:10:29,593
Please tell him that I haven't done
anything. I don't know anything.

101
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,265
It's all just a big mistake, okay?
Please tell him that.

102
00:10:34,369 --> 00:10:36,432
Yes, okay, okay. Hold on.

103
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,902
Mr. Jang wants to know
what's in the case.

104
00:10:48,006 --> 00:10:51,573
No, I don't know what's in the case. Do you
speak English or don't you speak English?

105
00:10:51,678 --> 00:10:55,618
Yes, I do. I studied one year at
International High School in New York.

106
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,120
Okay.

107
00:10:58,308 --> 00:11:01,876
Richard gave me the case to
give to you, that's all I know.

108
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,960
Okay? Please tell him that.

109
00:11:30,507 --> 00:11:33,616
He gave me a paper with numbers
written on it. What is this?

110
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,118
It's the code to open the case.

111
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:45,793
- What's really in here?
- Nothing dangerous.

112
00:11:47,524 --> 00:11:49,673
So why won't he open it himself?

113
00:11:54,574 --> 00:11:57,013
He doesn't trust Mr. Richard.

114
00:11:57,117 --> 00:12:01,184
I don't trust Richard, either.
I only dated him for a week.

115
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,525
Okay, okay, okay.

116
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,445
- Mr. Jang insists that you open the case.
- Okay, okay.

117
00:12:17,221 --> 00:12:19,535
Please, God, help me.

118
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,048
He wants you to hurry up.
Mr. Jang has other things to do.

119
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:06,416
Can you describe the
contents of the case?

120
00:13:07,312 --> 00:13:10,378
It's four plastic pouches filled
with a blue powder. Like a...

121
00:13:10,482 --> 00:13:13,923
Maybe a purple powder.
I don't know. It looks gross.

122
00:15:33,876 --> 00:15:37,066
Mr. Jang wants to offer you a job.

123
00:15:38,548 --> 00:15:39,819
A job?

124
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,533
I don't want a job.

125
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,955
If life starts
approximately a billion years ago,

126
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:56,836
we will have to wait 400,000 years to see
the aberration of the first nerve cells.

127
00:15:57,191 --> 00:15:59,547
This is where life as
we know it begins.

128
00:15:59,651 --> 00:16:02,842
Brains in formation of
only a few milligrams.

129
00:16:03,489 --> 00:16:08,431
It's not possible to determine
any sign of intelligence yet.

130
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:11,059
It acts more as a reflex.

131
00:16:11,288 --> 00:16:14,854
One neuron, you're alive.
Two neurons,

132
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:20,443
you're moving, and with movement,
interesting things begin to happen.

133
00:16:26,762 --> 00:16:29,410
Animal life on Earth goes
back millions of years.

134
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:34,874
Yet most species only use 3 to
5% of its cerebral capacity.

135
00:16:34,978 --> 00:16:39,879
But it isn't until we reached human
beings at the top of the animal chain

136
00:16:39,983 --> 00:16:44,676
that we finally see a species use
more of its cerebral capacity.

137
00:16:48,033 --> 00:16:52,350
10% may not seem like much, but it's a
lot if you look at all we've done with it.

138
00:17:26,363 --> 00:17:28,761
Now let's discuss a special case.

139
00:17:28,866 --> 00:17:33,933
The only living being that
uses its brain better than us.

140
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,685
The dolphin.

141
00:17:36,915 --> 00:17:40,189
It is estimated that
this incredible animal

142
00:17:40,377 --> 00:17:44,611
uses up to 20% of its
cerebral capacity.

143
00:17:44,715 --> 00:17:48,281
In particular, this allows it

144
00:17:48,844 --> 00:17:50,909
to have an echolocation system

145
00:17:51,013 --> 00:17:55,997
that is more efficient than any
sonar invented by mankind.

146
00:17:56,101 --> 00:18:00,710
But the dolphin did not invent
the sonar, it developed it naturally.

147
00:18:00,856 --> 00:18:07,717
And this is the crucial part of our
philosophical reflection we have today.

148
00:18:07,946 --> 00:18:13,389
Can we therefore conclude that
humans are concerned more with

149
00:18:13,786 --> 00:18:17,352
having... than being?

150
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,494
Lucy.

151
00:19:16,598 --> 00:19:19,122
What did you do to my stomach?

152
00:19:19,518 --> 00:19:22,457
Nothing! Just a little
horizontal slit.

153
00:19:23,105 --> 00:19:25,044
It's very well done. And...

154
00:19:25,524 --> 00:19:28,172
You'll find within a month,
the scar is practically invisible.

155
00:19:29,486 --> 00:19:32,760
So, you'll be able to show your
tummy off on the beach next summer.

156
00:19:32,865 --> 00:19:34,804
I don't care about the scar.

157
00:19:35,868 --> 00:19:39,309
Is it why we opened you up, yeah?

158
00:19:40,622 --> 00:19:43,730
Rest assured, we didn't harvest
your organs or anything.

159
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:47,442
We merely slipped a little
package into your lower tummy.

160
00:19:47,713 --> 00:19:51,321
It's a new drug that kids in Europe
are going to love, believe me.

161
00:19:51,425 --> 00:19:55,617
- What is it?
- Well, the scientific term is C.P.H.4.

162
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,786
Which is not very sexy from
a sales point of view.

163
00:19:58,891 --> 00:20:04,584
So we're still working on something
with a bit more pop. Any suggestions?

164
00:20:06,023 --> 00:20:08,254
Ah! Excuse me.

165
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:12,090
Welcome! Welcome, come on in.
Lovely! Oops!

166
00:20:15,074 --> 00:20:16,930
Splendid, splendid!

167
00:20:19,203 --> 00:20:20,683
Marvelous! Lovely, lovely.

168
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:22,393
Oh!

169
00:20:22,915 --> 00:20:24,395
- How are you?
- Very good, my dear.

170
00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:26,272
Okay.

171
00:20:26,376 --> 00:20:28,942
Right. Um... First of all,

172
00:20:29,254 --> 00:20:31,819
many thanks for taking
part in this enterprise,

173
00:20:31,924 --> 00:20:36,824
which I'm sure will go off flawlessly.
These lovely passports and tickets

174
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:40,453
will enable you to return
home in the next 24 hours.

175
00:20:40,766 --> 00:20:44,582
Now, upon arrival, you will be
taken in hand by our people,

176
00:20:44,686 --> 00:20:47,043
so that we might recover
our merchandise

177
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:51,129
and you might rediscover the freedom
which you so richly deserve.

178
00:20:51,734 --> 00:20:56,218
I'm sure I don't need to remind you,
but for any of those who may be tempted

179
00:20:56,322 --> 00:21:00,431
to warn or turn themselves
in to the authorities,

180
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:06,229
we have the names and addresses of
the families of every one of you,

181
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,356
down to the most
distant cousins, right?

182
00:21:10,504 --> 00:21:14,571
So, we rely, therefore,
on your complete discretion.

183
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:18,017
Good!
Anyway, gentlemen, madam,

184
00:21:18,122 --> 00:21:22,412
allow me to be the first
to wish you... bon voyage!

185
00:21:28,605 --> 00:21:29,711
Oops.

186
00:21:30,983 --> 00:21:32,088
Lovely.

187
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:35,882
- You're gonna sell this?
- I'm afraid it's our business model.

188
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:43,433
For primitive beings like us,
life seems to have only one single purpose,

189
00:21:43,537 --> 00:21:44,934
gaining time.

190
00:21:45,831 --> 00:21:49,271
And it is going through
time that seems to be also

191
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,734
the only real purpose of each
of the cells in our bodies.

192
00:21:53,172 --> 00:21:55,904
To achieve that aim,
the mass of the cells

193
00:21:56,008 --> 00:22:01,491
that make up earthworms and human
beings has only two solutions.

194
00:22:01,722 --> 00:22:06,080
Be immortal... or to reproduce.

195
00:22:06,185 --> 00:22:10,460
If its habitat is not sufficiently
favorable or nurturing...

196
00:22:17,863 --> 00:22:20,094
The cell will choose immortality.

197
00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:24,432
In other words, self-sufficiency
and self-management.

198
00:22:24,912 --> 00:22:28,269
On the other hand, if the
habitat is favorable...

199
00:22:33,337 --> 00:22:35,318
They will choose to reproduce.

200
00:22:44,598 --> 00:22:49,791
That way, when they die, they hand down
essential information and knowledge

201
00:22:49,895 --> 00:22:53,251
to the next cell, which hands it
down to the next cell and so on.

202
00:23:05,411 --> 00:23:10,435
Thus, knowledge and learning
are handed down through time.

203
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:16,942
Okay, okay. Keep calm.
You have to wait. Just play for time.

204
00:23:17,046 --> 00:23:19,862
You'll have time to think it through
on the plane. Just take the flight.

205
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:24,158
Take the flight, get out of here. That's
the main thing right now. Just save time.

206
00:23:24,263 --> 00:23:27,202
Don't try anything.
Keep your cool. You're alive.

207
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:31,124
You're alive, babe. You're alive.
That's all that matters. Just wait.

208
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,667
Save time.

209
00:23:34,313 --> 00:23:35,419
Save time.

210
00:24:08,015 --> 00:24:09,578
I'm not in the mood.

211
00:26:07,091 --> 00:26:09,157
Let's imagine for a few moments

212
00:26:09,261 --> 00:26:12,868
what our life would be like if
we could access, let's say,

213
00:26:13,097 --> 00:26:16,080
20% of our brain's capacity.

214
00:26:16,185 --> 00:26:22,586
This first stage would give us access
to and control of our own body.

215
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,755
- Sir?
- Yes.

216
00:26:25,234 --> 00:26:26,758
Has it been proved scientifically?

217
00:26:26,862 --> 00:26:32,702
For the moment, it's just hypothesis,
I confess. But if you think about it,

218
00:26:32,807 --> 00:26:37,518
it's troubling to realize that the Greeks,
the Egyptians and the Indians

219
00:26:37,623 --> 00:26:42,148
had notion of cells centuries before
the invention of the microscope.

220
00:26:42,502 --> 00:26:44,192
And what to say about Darwin,

221
00:26:44,296 --> 00:26:48,570
whom everybody took for a fool when
he put forth his theory of evolution.

222
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:52,199
It's up to us to push
the rules and laws

223
00:26:52,303 --> 00:26:54,910
and go from evolution to revolution.

224
00:26:57,476 --> 00:27:03,210
100 billion neurons per human,
of which only 15% are activated.

225
00:27:03,314 --> 00:27:07,965
There are more connections in the human
body than there are stars in the galaxy.

226
00:27:08,569 --> 00:27:12,469
We possess a gigantic
network of information

227
00:27:12,573 --> 00:27:15,181
to which we have almost no access.

228
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:18,225
- Sir?
- Yes.

229
00:27:18,538 --> 00:27:20,102
And what will be the next stage?

230
00:27:20,499 --> 00:27:23,731
Well, the next stage would probably
be control of other people.

231
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:29,444
But for that, we would need to access
at least 40% of our brain's capacity.

232
00:27:30,217 --> 00:27:35,742
After control of ourselves and
others would come control of matter.

233
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,955
But now we're entering into
the realm of science fiction

234
00:27:40,102 --> 00:27:43,959
and we don't know any more than
a dog who watches the moon.

235
00:27:44,355 --> 00:27:46,003
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes.

236
00:27:46,233 --> 00:27:49,591
But what would happen if,
for some reason we ignore,

237
00:27:49,695 --> 00:27:53,135
somebody unlocked 100%
of their cerebral capacity?

238
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,390
- 100%?
- Yes.

239
00:28:00,496 --> 00:28:02,144
I have no idea.

240
00:29:17,657 --> 00:29:18,762
Ahhh!

241
00:29:34,132 --> 00:29:35,279
Hey!

242
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:48,186
- Hey! You speak English?
- No, no, no.

243
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,269
Ahhh!

244
00:30:49,373 --> 00:30:50,854
- You speak English?
- Yes, yes.

245
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:52,814
- Take me to the hospital now.
- Hospital.

246
00:30:55,296 --> 00:30:56,485
My leg!

247
00:31:42,093 --> 00:31:44,574
- Hospital!
- Wait for me.

248
00:32:31,476 --> 00:32:33,290
Miss! Hello?

249
00:32:35,646 --> 00:32:38,920
- Hey! Miss!
- I need help. It's urgent.

250
00:32:39,025 --> 00:32:43,091
You cannot be in here.
We are operating! Please, get out!

251
00:33:01,923 --> 00:33:04,196
You wouldn't have been
able to save him anyway.

252
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,386
The tumor had already invaded the
cortex and the right side of his spine.

253
00:33:10,348 --> 00:33:13,956
Somebody put a bag of drugs in me.
I need you to remove it. It's leaking.

254
00:33:16,729 --> 00:33:18,126
Do it now.

255
00:33:18,689 --> 00:33:22,130
Right. I'll just administer
a local anesthetic.

256
00:33:22,235 --> 00:33:23,632
Don't bother.

257
00:33:23,736 --> 00:33:27,052
Right. Okay.

258
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,305
Calm down, please. Put the gun down.

259
00:33:31,327 --> 00:33:34,810
I'm just going to examine, okay?

260
00:33:38,126 --> 00:33:39,982
- Do you mind?
- No.

261
00:33:48,928 --> 00:33:50,951
- Hello?
- Mom?

262
00:33:51,055 --> 00:33:52,953
Hey! Lucy.

263
00:33:53,057 --> 00:33:57,958
Baby, it's great to hear from you!
But what time is it over there?

264
00:33:59,564 --> 00:34:00,711
I don't know, it's night.

265
00:34:00,815 --> 00:34:02,838
Hold on a sec, let me
get rid of the other line.

266
00:34:02,942 --> 00:34:05,299
I'm going to have to go inside.

267
00:34:06,028 --> 00:34:09,136
I'm back. You're not
partying too much, are you?

268
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,763
You promised me you'd
look after yourself.

269
00:34:11,868 --> 00:34:14,474
I'm trying to, Mom.
I am trying to.

270
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:18,437
Well, thanks for calling
out of the blue like this.

271
00:34:18,541 --> 00:34:22,399
Your father's gonna be sad he missed you.
He isn't home from the gym yet.

272
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,110
Usually, you call us in the morning.

273
00:34:25,214 --> 00:34:27,362
- Mom?
- Yes?

274
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,698
I feel everything.

275
00:34:30,428 --> 00:34:32,534
What do you mean, sweetie?

276
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:35,871
Space,

277
00:34:36,767 --> 00:34:38,436
the air,

278
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:44,254
the vibrations,

279
00:34:45,777 --> 00:34:47,382
the people.

280
00:34:49,405 --> 00:34:51,887
I can feel the gravity.

281
00:34:53,284 --> 00:34:55,974
I can feel the rotation of the Earth,

282
00:34:57,663 --> 00:34:59,936
the heat leaving my body,

283
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:03,065
the blood in my veins.

284
00:35:04,712 --> 00:35:07,069
I can feel my brain,

285
00:35:08,466 --> 00:35:11,198
the deepest parts of my memory...

286
00:35:11,302 --> 00:35:15,118
Sweetie, we have a bad connection.
I can't hear you so well.

287
00:35:15,223 --> 00:35:17,329
What did you say about memory?

288
00:35:19,352 --> 00:35:23,752
The pain in my mouth
when I had braces.

289
00:35:23,856 --> 00:35:29,131
I can remember the feeling of your hand
on my forehead when I ran a fever.

290
00:35:30,238 --> 00:35:33,095
I remember stroking
the cat, it was so soft.

291
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:35,931
The cat? What cat, honey?

292
00:35:36,911 --> 00:35:39,768
A Siamese with blue
eyes and a broken tail.

293
00:35:39,872 --> 00:35:44,272
Sweetie, you can't possibly remember that.
You were barely a year old.

294
00:35:47,171 --> 00:35:51,530
I remember the taste of
your milk in my mouth.

295
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:56,618
The room, the liquid...

296
00:35:58,641 --> 00:36:02,541
Sweetie, what are you talking about?

297
00:36:04,062 --> 00:36:07,879
I just wanna tell you that
I love you, Mom and Dad.

298
00:36:07,984 --> 00:36:09,214
Sweetie...

299
00:36:09,694 --> 00:36:15,762
And I wanna thank you for the thousand
kisses that I can still feel on my face.

300
00:36:19,245 --> 00:36:21,059
I love you, Mom.

301
00:36:21,164 --> 00:36:26,148
I love you, too, sweetie.
More than anything in the world.

302
00:36:34,802 --> 00:36:36,658
How much is left?

303
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,201
500 grams.

304
00:36:39,932 --> 00:36:43,874
And how long will it take my body
to eliminate the rest of it?

305
00:36:46,063 --> 00:36:49,880
To answer that, I need to
know what it is. May I?

306
00:36:50,276 --> 00:36:51,381
Go ahead.

307
00:36:52,612 --> 00:36:54,051
C.P.H.4.

308
00:36:57,825 --> 00:36:59,431
Tell me about it.

309
00:37:01,411 --> 00:37:03,601
Pregnant women manufacture C.P.H.4

310
00:37:03,705 --> 00:37:07,773
in the sixth week of pregnancy
in tiny quantities.

311
00:37:08,377 --> 00:37:12,486
For a baby, it packs the
power of an atomic bomb.

312
00:37:13,257 --> 00:37:18,784
It's what gives the fetus the necessary
energy to form all the bones in its body.

313
00:37:18,888 --> 00:37:21,536
I'd heard they tried to make
a synthetic version of it.

314
00:37:21,641 --> 00:37:23,497
I didn't realize that
they'd succeeded.

315
00:37:24,685 --> 00:37:26,792
If it really is C.P.H.4,

316
00:37:27,355 --> 00:37:30,629
in this quantity,
I'm amazed you're still alive.

317
00:37:31,567 --> 00:37:33,130
Not for long.

318
00:39:39,695 --> 00:39:42,427
Learning's always a painful process.

319
00:39:42,657 --> 00:39:46,473
Like when you're little and your bones
are growing and you ache all over.

320
00:39:47,035 --> 00:39:50,352
Can you believe I can remember
the sound of my own bones growing?

321
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:55,981
Like this grinding under the skin.
Everything's different now.

322
00:39:56,087 --> 00:40:00,695
Like, sounds are music that
I can understand, like fluids.

323
00:40:02,175 --> 00:40:07,536
It's funny, I used to be so concerned
with who I was and what I wanted to be

324
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,540
and now that I have access to
the furthest reaches of my brain,

325
00:40:11,644 --> 00:40:16,168
I see things clearly and realize that
what makes us us it's primitive.

326
00:40:17,859 --> 00:40:22,217
They're all obstacles.
Does that make any sense?

327
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:27,888
Like this pain you're experiencing.
It's blocking you from understanding.

328
00:40:28,953 --> 00:40:32,853
All you know now is pain.
That's all you know, pain.

329
00:40:36,002 --> 00:40:37,107
Where are the others?

330
00:40:38,045 --> 00:40:42,737
The others carrying the drugs. I need
the rest of it, for medicinal purposes.

331
00:41:12,954 --> 00:41:14,352
Berlin.

332
00:41:19,504 --> 00:41:20,609
Paris.

333
00:41:27,345 --> 00:41:28,450
Rome.

334
00:41:33,893 --> 00:41:35,582
Thank you for sharing.

335
00:41:49,699 --> 00:41:52,307
- Oh. Evening, Professor.
- Bonsoir, Albert.

336
00:41:52,744 --> 00:41:56,852
- Do we have you for dinner tonight?
- I'm afraid so. I'm exhausted.

337
00:41:56,958 --> 00:41:59,105
- Have a good rest.
- Thank you.

338
00:42:04,674 --> 00:42:08,573
You scared the shit out of me,
ringing that bell like some nutbar!

339
00:42:08,678 --> 00:42:10,033
I missed you.

340
00:42:12,472 --> 00:42:13,620
Me, too.

341
00:42:14,851 --> 00:42:17,749
- Yeah, you lose your keys or something?
- Yeah.

342
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:21,377
- Can I borrow your laptop?
- Yeah, of course.

343
00:42:21,481 --> 00:42:24,298
So I spent all of yesterday in
auditions, which are awesome.

344
00:42:24,402 --> 00:42:26,215
They just have you
standing around all day

345
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:29,553
because they don't give a shit about
your time gabbing away in Chinese.

346
00:42:29,657 --> 00:42:32,638
Who understands Chinese?
I don't understand Chinese.

347
00:42:32,742 --> 00:42:35,516
And then they say they're always
gonna call, and they never do,

348
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,665
because they don't even take
your phone number. You know?

349
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:40,604
Except this one guy,
but he's not Chinese.

350
00:42:41,127 --> 00:42:43,483
He works at the agency and he's cute.

351
00:42:43,588 --> 00:42:47,111
Oh, my God, he's cute. In the
cute-and-I-kinda-know-it kinda way.

352
00:42:47,215 --> 00:42:49,572
Like he had this thing...
Oh, my God, and his ass!

353
00:42:49,926 --> 00:42:51,907
Phew! Let me get started on that!

354
00:42:52,597 --> 00:42:54,661
And you are never gonna
guess where he took me.

355
00:42:55,558 --> 00:42:59,958
Four Seasons, Royal Suites,
and we made love all night.

356
00:43:00,897 --> 00:43:04,129
I'm sorry, I'm talking about myself.
What's up? How's Richard?

357
00:43:04,399 --> 00:43:05,504
He's dead.

358
00:43:05,775 --> 00:43:09,426
You guys are crazy.
I'm gonna take a shower.

359
00:43:20,499 --> 00:43:22,898
- Yes?
- Professor Norman, my name's Lucy.

360
00:43:23,002 --> 00:43:27,026
I just read all your research on
the human brain. We need to meet.

361
00:43:28,299 --> 00:43:32,658
All of my research?
Well, I'm very flattered, young lady,

362
00:43:32,762 --> 00:43:36,203
but I find that hard to believe.
I must have written no less than...

363
00:43:36,307 --> 00:43:40,707
6,734 pages. I can recite them
to you all by heart, if you wish.

364
00:43:44,689 --> 00:43:47,296
Are you one of Emily's friends?

365
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,132
This sounds like one of her silly jokes.
Is she there with you?

366
00:43:50,905 --> 00:43:52,259
No, I'm all on my own.

367
00:43:54,741 --> 00:43:56,931
- Who are you?
- I just told you.

368
00:43:57,452 --> 00:43:58,557
Uh...

369
00:43:58,703 --> 00:44:02,228
Lucy, right? Yes, sorry.

370
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:04,815
I read your theory on the
use of the brain's capacity.

371
00:44:04,919 --> 00:44:07,025
It's a little rudimentary,
but you're on the right track.

372
00:44:08,631 --> 00:44:09,819
Thank you.

373
00:44:10,048 --> 00:44:13,197
Professor, my cells are reproducing
at a phenomenal speed.

374
00:44:13,301 --> 00:44:14,783
Several million per second.

375
00:44:14,929 --> 00:44:18,077
I'm having trouble precisely
evaluating the time of my death,

376
00:44:18,181 --> 00:44:22,081
- but I doubt I'll last more than 24 hours.
- What are you talking about?

377
00:44:22,185 --> 00:44:25,459
What I'm saying is that your
theory is not a theory.

378
00:44:25,564 --> 00:44:29,672
I absorbed a large quantity
of synthetic C.P.H.4.

379
00:44:29,776 --> 00:44:32,967
that will allow me to use
100% of my cerebral capacity.

380
00:44:33,114 --> 00:44:36,596
Right now, I'm at 28%,
and what you wrote is true.

381
00:44:36,701 --> 00:44:40,349
Once the brain reaches 20%,
it opens up and expands the rest.

382
00:44:40,453 --> 00:44:43,437
There are no more obstacles.
They fall away like dominoes.

383
00:44:43,541 --> 00:44:45,271
I'm colonizing my own brain.

384
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:52,320
Well,
I don't know what to... say.

385
00:44:53,551 --> 00:44:58,492
It's true, I've been working on
this theory for over 20 years,

386
00:44:58,597 --> 00:45:04,166
but it's only ever been
hypotheses and research ideas.

387
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:07,001
I never thought anyone would...

388
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:12,173
- You can control your own metabolism?
- Yes.

389
00:45:12,527 --> 00:45:15,509
And I can start to control
other people's bodies.

390
00:45:15,697 --> 00:45:19,555
Also, I can control magnetic
and electric waves.

391
00:45:19,659 --> 00:45:22,641
Not all of them, just the most basic.

392
00:45:22,829 --> 00:45:25,937
Television. Telephone.

393
00:45:28,627 --> 00:45:31,067
Radio.

394
00:45:33,423 --> 00:45:35,071
That's amazing.

395
00:45:37,093 --> 00:45:38,908
I don't feel pain,

396
00:45:40,388 --> 00:45:43,851
fear, desire.

397
00:45:45,644 --> 00:45:49,294
It's like all things that make
us human are fading away.

398
00:45:50,608 --> 00:45:54,383
It's like the less human I feel,

399
00:45:55,321 --> 00:45:59,178
all this knowledge about everything,

400
00:45:59,282 --> 00:46:02,223
quantum physics, applied mathematics,

401
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:06,852
the infinite capacity
of a cell's nucleus.

402
00:46:07,249 --> 00:46:11,357
They're all exploding inside
my brain, all this knowledge.

403
00:46:11,461 --> 00:46:13,193
I don't know what to do with it.

404
00:46:15,757 --> 00:46:18,907
If you're asking me what to do...

405
00:46:27,978 --> 00:46:29,334
You know,

406
00:46:31,941 --> 00:46:36,633
if you think about...
the very nature of life,

407
00:46:37,279 --> 00:46:40,094
I mean, from the very beginning,

408
00:46:40,574 --> 00:46:43,765
the development of the first cell

409
00:46:44,744 --> 00:46:47,601
that divided into two cells.

410
00:46:48,915 --> 00:46:51,439
The sole purpose of life has been

411
00:46:52,794 --> 00:46:55,609
to pass on what was learned.

412
00:46:56,631 --> 00:46:59,572
There was no higher purpose.

413
00:47:00,468 --> 00:47:05,453
So if you're asking me what to do with all
this knowledge you're accumulating, I'd say

414
00:47:07,392 --> 00:47:08,831
pass it on.

415
00:47:11,147 --> 00:47:15,276
Just like any simple cell

416
00:47:15,942 --> 00:47:17,506
going through time.

417
00:47:18,904 --> 00:47:20,134
Time.

418
00:47:21,531 --> 00:47:23,012
Yes, of course.

419
00:47:25,702 --> 00:47:27,516
I'll be at your door in 12 hours.

420
00:47:36,379 --> 00:47:38,277
- You're leaving?
- Yes.

421
00:47:41,259 --> 00:47:43,032
- What is this?
- A prescription.

422
00:47:43,888 --> 00:47:45,910
Since when did you start
writing in Chinese?

423
00:47:46,182 --> 00:47:49,288
- Since an hour ago.
- Luce, I don't understand any of this.

424
00:47:49,392 --> 00:47:51,957
Your kidneys aren't functioning
efficiently, your liver's failing you.

425
00:47:52,062 --> 00:47:53,794
You need to make some
lifestyle changes.

426
00:47:53,898 --> 00:47:58,172
Take this medication, work out,
eat organic. You'll be okay.

427
00:48:06,202 --> 00:48:08,516
Last night, at 11 pm,
a woman shot a patient dead.

428
00:48:08,745 --> 00:48:12,978
- It happened at Tri-Service Hospital.
- The suspect is 25, blonde, medium height.

429
00:48:13,083 --> 00:48:17,191
Police are hunting nationwide.
She is armed and dangerous.

430
00:48:38,651 --> 00:48:39,630
Del Rio.

431
00:48:39,734 --> 00:48:42,508
I've got a weird call
from a US citizen in Taiwan.

432
00:48:42,612 --> 00:48:46,095
A young woman calling to tip
us off about a big drugs ring.

433
00:48:46,242 --> 00:48:48,264
- I'll take it.
- I'll tape you.

434
00:48:48,451 --> 00:48:49,433
Hello?

435
00:48:49,537 --> 00:48:51,642
I have important information
about a group of drug traffickers.

436
00:48:51,746 --> 00:48:54,186
I need to speak with someone
in a position of authority.

437
00:48:54,291 --> 00:48:59,066
Aha. You're very lucky, there's no one with
more authority in this office than me.

438
00:48:59,171 --> 00:49:01,277
But let's start at the beginning.
What is your name?

439
00:49:01,381 --> 00:49:05,031
Listen up, Pierre Del Rio.
Get off your desk, sit in your chair,

440
00:49:05,135 --> 00:49:07,992
pick up the red pen to the left of
you and take down everything I say.

441
00:49:14,644 --> 00:49:17,918
There are no cameras. Hurry up!
I've no time to waste.

442
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:26,886
Go ahead.

443
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:30,389
I'm gonna be sending you the details of
three people about to arrive in Europe.

444
00:49:30,494 --> 00:49:33,359
Each one is carrying a kilo of drugs.
I need you to arrest them

445
00:49:33,464 --> 00:49:35,436
and collect the substance.
I'll need it for later.

446
00:49:35,624 --> 00:49:38,564
What form are these drugs in?
Bars? Capsules?

447
00:49:38,752 --> 00:49:42,443
Powder. Hidden in plastic pouches
inside their intestines.

448
00:49:42,547 --> 00:49:43,569
Excuse me?

449
00:49:43,673 --> 00:49:46,447
Make sure to be careful when you remove
them. The product is very powerful.

450
00:49:53,517 --> 00:49:54,622
Believe me.

451
00:49:56,228 --> 00:49:58,668
- Got it?
- Yeah.

452
00:49:59,189 --> 00:50:00,336
Good.

453
00:50:01,233 --> 00:50:02,797
I'm counting on you.

454
00:50:06,029 --> 00:50:07,134
Okay?

455
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,145
Good morning.

456
00:50:20,345 --> 00:50:21,545
Thank you.

457
00:50:28,218 --> 00:50:30,908
That's him! Pick him up.

458
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,690
Come with me, please.

459
00:51:01,126 --> 00:51:02,627
Hello.

460
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:05,213
Sir, come with us.

461
00:51:20,937 --> 00:51:23,085
Welcome to Rome.

462
00:51:31,072 --> 00:51:32,553
Good morning, sir.

463
00:51:32,657 --> 00:51:36,515
- Please, follow me. This way.
- Yeah, sure.

464
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:54,784
Del Rio.

465
00:51:54,888 --> 00:51:57,828
Thanks for calling me back.

466
00:51:57,933 --> 00:51:59,330
We took delivery of your package.

467
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:02,375
Thanks very much. I'll send you
the paperwork for the transfer.

468
00:52:02,479 --> 00:52:03,626
Bye.

469
00:52:04,147 --> 00:52:06,295
Okay, we got all three.

470
00:52:10,403 --> 00:52:12,009
Ladies and gentlemen,

471
00:52:12,113 --> 00:52:14,428
we are now beginning our descent
to Paris Charles de Gaulle.

472
00:52:23,834 --> 00:52:26,232
Miss, I have to ask you to
put away your computers now.

473
00:52:26,336 --> 00:52:27,525
You should wipe your nose.

474
00:52:28,171 --> 00:52:30,403
- Excuse me?
- May I have a glass of champagne?

475
00:52:32,425 --> 00:52:34,031
Um, yes. Of course.

476
00:52:37,681 --> 00:52:39,578
Could you bring some champagne
to the girl over there?

477
00:52:39,683 --> 00:52:40,788
Yeah, I just have a nosebleed.

478
00:52:52,946 --> 00:52:54,885
Miss, your champagne.

479
00:52:56,032 --> 00:52:57,304
Thank you.

480
00:52:57,701 --> 00:53:01,079
I'm very sorry, but you really
need to close your table now.

481
00:53:01,913 --> 00:53:03,144
Sure.

482
00:53:13,049 --> 00:53:14,572
To knowledge.

483
00:53:25,394 --> 00:53:28,669
If the habitat is not sufficiently
favorable or nurturing...

484
00:53:38,115 --> 00:53:39,805
The cell will choose immortality.

485
00:53:45,957 --> 00:53:49,230
In other words, self-sufficiency
and self-management.

486
00:54:05,268 --> 00:54:06,457
No! Miss, miss!

487
00:54:08,647 --> 00:54:10,086
You must remain seated!

488
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:11,671
Miss!

489
00:54:17,154 --> 00:54:22,306
Miss! Open the door!
You really have to go back to your seat!

490
00:54:23,829 --> 00:54:25,726
We're gonna land soon.
Please! Open the door.

491
00:54:27,624 --> 00:54:30,731
Please, say something.
Are you okay? Miss?

492
00:54:32,921 --> 00:54:34,276
Miss?

493
00:54:35,382 --> 00:54:37,278
Miss, please, open the door!

494
00:54:41,304 --> 00:54:43,703
Please do something, help me! Please!

495
00:54:53,817 --> 00:54:55,089
We're gonna land soon!
Open the door!

496
00:55:04,452 --> 00:55:08,144
Miss! Are you okay? Say something!

497
00:55:15,568 --> 00:55:17,737
With a scar on her lower abdomen?

498
00:55:17,841 --> 00:55:19,572
Pretty recent, with thread in it.

499
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:22,282
- How is she?
- Fine. She's sleeping.

500
00:55:22,386 --> 00:55:25,036
With the shot I gave her,
she'll be out all day.

501
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:10,081
- She's awake!
- Are you sure?

502
00:56:10,185 --> 00:56:11,831
She's sitting on the bed.

503
00:56:16,732 --> 00:56:17,837
That's her.

504
00:56:17,943 --> 00:56:20,091
- You didn't restrain her?
- Sure, we did!

505
00:56:21,278 --> 00:56:24,052
Miss! Don't move.

506
00:56:24,156 --> 00:56:25,638
I need to talk to you alone.

507
00:56:25,866 --> 00:56:27,847
And I need you to put
your hands up, please.

508
00:56:48,849 --> 00:56:50,496
Did you get the packets?

509
00:56:51,685 --> 00:56:52,790
Yes.

510
00:56:53,894 --> 00:56:56,544
- Where are they?
- They're safe.

511
00:56:57,148 --> 00:57:01,465
- Here, in Paris.
- They'll be safer in my hands.

512
00:57:19,754 --> 00:57:21,527
Don't leave the car there. Park it up.

513
00:57:30,265 --> 00:57:33,121
You know, as a cop you
see some pretty weird shit.

514
00:57:33,225 --> 00:57:37,877
But I have to be honest with you. What
you did back there, that freaked me out.

515
00:57:38,315 --> 00:57:42,756
To put everyone to sleep like that.
Do I need to be worried?

516
00:57:42,943 --> 00:57:44,133
No.

517
00:57:45,404 --> 00:57:46,760
Good.

518
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:09,742
Do you mind?

519
00:58:10,013 --> 00:58:11,118
No.

520
00:58:28,949 --> 00:58:32,139
- What's that?
- Korean. I'm gonna drive.

521
00:58:32,701 --> 00:58:35,142
Hey! No, no, no.
This is a police car!

522
00:58:35,704 --> 00:58:39,939
You can't. No, this is not possible,
lady. This is a police car.

523
00:58:42,379 --> 00:58:43,691
Okay, okay.

524
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:52,826
Let's go, guys!

525
00:58:57,352 --> 00:59:00,792
Sir, sir, excuse me, sir.
I need to talk to somebody.

526
00:59:00,896 --> 00:59:03,045
Talk to the police.

527
00:59:03,233 --> 00:59:05,673
Look, I'm a German citizen
and I demand to see a lawyer.

528
00:59:06,194 --> 00:59:07,507
I'll check with Surgery.

529
00:59:07,611 --> 00:59:10,094
- Grab us some food.
- You're a foodaholic.

530
00:59:38,475 --> 00:59:41,125
- Do you always drive like that?
- I've never driven before.

531
00:59:41,563 --> 00:59:42,668
Great.

532
00:59:48,445 --> 00:59:50,551
- Hey, that's one-way.
- We're late.

533
01:00:12,928 --> 01:00:15,784
- Hey, I'd rather be late than dead.
- We never really die.

534
01:01:05,522 --> 01:01:08,462
Sorry, sir. I don't feel good.

535
01:01:15,532 --> 01:01:18,138
I'm fine. I'm fine.

536
01:01:30,422 --> 01:01:33,028
- I'm gonna tell them to stop following us.
- Don't bother.

537
01:02:15,966 --> 01:02:17,072
I got you bacon...

538
01:02:55,632 --> 01:02:57,822
Give me the case.

539
01:02:57,926 --> 01:03:00,240
Kill her and get the pouch.

540
01:03:17,654 --> 01:03:19,760
Don't stand there, kill her!

541
01:03:44,471 --> 01:03:45,577
Ahhh!

542
01:04:07,579 --> 01:04:08,725
Open it.

543
01:04:22,384 --> 01:04:23,531
Let's go.

544
01:04:23,719 --> 01:04:26,118
I'm not sure I could be
of any help for you.

545
01:04:30,894 --> 01:04:31,999
Yes, you are.

546
01:04:32,811 --> 01:04:34,230
What for?

547
01:04:40,569 --> 01:04:42,050
A reminder.

548
01:04:43,072 --> 01:04:44,511
Shall we go?

549
01:05:12,268 --> 01:05:13,373
Where are we going?

550
01:05:13,811 --> 01:05:16,021
Take the first left.

551
01:05:17,649 --> 01:05:18,878
Okay.

552
01:05:28,784 --> 01:05:30,932
Move!

553
01:05:34,748 --> 01:05:36,480
Follow that car.

554
01:05:39,963 --> 01:05:41,192
Professor?

555
01:05:42,131 --> 01:05:43,611
- Hello?
- Lucy.

556
01:05:43,716 --> 01:05:47,366
Oh! It's her! It's her! Hey, you.

557
01:05:47,679 --> 01:05:49,409
- You're in Paris?
- Yes, I am.

558
01:05:49,513 --> 01:05:51,286
Good, good! Excellent.

559
01:05:51,432 --> 01:05:54,706
So, look, I am no longer
at the hotel now.

560
01:05:54,810 --> 01:05:57,834
I have come to the university,
where I've taken the liberty

561
01:05:57,938 --> 01:06:00,962
of calling together a few of my
colleagues to discuss your case.

562
01:06:01,066 --> 01:06:04,175
Top minds in their field
and very trustworthy.

563
01:06:04,279 --> 01:06:06,760
- I trust you.
- Oh, thank you.

564
01:06:06,864 --> 01:06:08,011
So, do you think you could meet us

565
01:06:08,115 --> 01:06:10,346
here at the university?

566
01:06:13,871 --> 01:06:15,226
I'm, uh...

567
01:06:15,831 --> 01:06:18,480
- I'm very pleased to meet you.
- Likewise.

568
01:06:18,876 --> 01:06:21,608
- Captain Del Rio.
- How do you do?

569
01:06:21,754 --> 01:06:22,859
Um...

570
01:06:23,006 --> 01:06:26,029
Let me introduce you
to my colleagues.

571
01:06:26,133 --> 01:06:30,825
- This is Professor Cartier, neurosurgeon.
- I know who everyone is.

572
01:06:32,015 --> 01:06:33,453
Of course.

573
01:06:33,724 --> 01:06:39,709
Gentlemen, this is Lucy,
the first woman to... I mean...

574
01:06:39,813 --> 01:06:45,340
As I mentioned earlier, Miss Lucy has,
for reasons that remain a mystery to me,

575
01:06:45,444 --> 01:06:49,094
unlocked certain
portions of her brain

576
01:06:49,198 --> 01:06:54,808
that offer access to previously
unexplored cerebral zones.

577
01:06:55,538 --> 01:06:57,852
She has abilities.

578
01:06:58,499 --> 01:06:59,854
Can you give us an example?

579
01:07:00,335 --> 01:07:03,274
Your daughter, Gabrielle,
age 6, died in a car accident.

580
01:07:03,879 --> 01:07:08,321
It was a blue car, leather seats, plastic
bird hanging from the rear view mirror.

581
01:07:25,213 --> 01:07:28,049
Boss, 5 men
down at the hospital. Sorry.

582
01:07:28,946 --> 01:07:33,096
- How many men left?
- I have about 25 with me.

583
01:07:33,492 --> 01:07:37,600
That damn girl, she doesn't
give in. She's a witch.

584
01:07:39,957 --> 01:07:41,438
I know that.

585
01:07:42,751 --> 01:07:44,941
I'll kill her myself.

586
01:07:49,842 --> 01:07:52,782
There are men coming here. Can you
secure the room? I need to stay focused.

587
01:07:52,887 --> 01:07:53,992
Sure.

588
01:07:59,727 --> 01:08:00,874
Speed it up.

589
01:08:11,030 --> 01:08:13,303
How did you manage to
access all this information?

590
01:08:13,407 --> 01:08:18,099
Electrical impulses. Every cell
knows and talks to every other cell.

591
01:08:18,204 --> 01:08:21,519
They exchange a thousand bits of
information between them per second.

592
01:08:21,624 --> 01:08:25,190
Cells group together,
forming a giant web of communication,

593
01:08:25,294 --> 01:08:26,733
which in turn forms matter.

594
01:08:27,922 --> 01:08:30,737
Cells get together, take on one form,

595
01:08:31,508 --> 01:08:35,909
deform, reform. Makes no difference,
it's all the same.

596
01:08:36,472 --> 01:08:39,829
Humans consider themselves unique,
so they've rooted their whole theory

597
01:08:39,934 --> 01:08:43,917
of existence on their uniqueness.
"One" is their unit of measure.

598
01:08:44,021 --> 01:08:48,546
But it's not. All social systems we've
put into place are a mere sketch.

599
01:08:48,651 --> 01:08:51,174
One plus one equals two.
That's all we've learned.

600
01:08:51,278 --> 01:08:54,344
But one plus one has
never equaled two.

601
01:08:54,448 --> 01:08:57,389
There are, in fact,
no numbers and no letters.

602
01:08:57,493 --> 01:09:01,059
We've codified our existence
to bring it down to human size

603
01:09:01,163 --> 01:09:03,103
to make it comprehensible.

604
01:09:03,207 --> 01:09:07,941
We've created a scale so that we
can forget its unfathomable scale.

605
01:09:11,382 --> 01:09:13,697
But if humans are not
the unit of measure

606
01:09:14,009 --> 01:09:16,825
and the world isn't governed
by mathematical laws,

607
01:09:18,013 --> 01:09:19,327
what governs all that?

608
01:09:21,350 --> 01:09:25,959
Film a car speeding down a road.
Speed up the image infinitely

609
01:09:26,689 --> 01:09:28,670
and the car disappears.

610
01:09:31,569 --> 01:09:34,551
So what proof do we
have of its existence?

611
01:09:34,822 --> 01:09:40,390
Time gives legitimacy to its existence.
Time is the only true unit of measure.

612
01:09:40,703 --> 01:09:43,643
It gives proof to the
existence of matter.

613
01:09:44,081 --> 01:09:45,645
Without time,

614
01:09:46,375 --> 01:09:47,981
we don't exist.

615
01:09:54,633 --> 01:09:55,780
Time is unity.

616
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:07,021
Search the whole
building and find her!

617
01:10:10,274 --> 01:10:12,212
We won't be able to hold
them for much longer.

618
01:10:13,527 --> 01:10:15,215
Time to go then.

619
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:32,650
Are you sure you need such huge doses?
I'm afraid you won't survive.

620
01:10:32,755 --> 01:10:36,780
Some cells inside me will fight and
defend their integrity till the very end.

621
01:10:36,926 --> 01:10:40,617
In order to attain the last
few percent, I have to force it

622
01:10:40,721 --> 01:10:43,078
to crack the cells
open to their nucleus.

623
01:10:52,148 --> 01:10:54,546
But all of this knowledge, Lucy...

624
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:59,052
I'm not even sure that
mankind is ready for it.

625
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:02,055
We're so driven by power and profit.

626
01:11:02,368 --> 01:11:04,537
Given man's nature,

627
01:11:05,287 --> 01:11:08,603
it might bring us only
instability and chaos.

628
01:11:12,753 --> 01:11:15,275
Ignorance brings chaos,
not knowledge.

629
01:11:15,463 --> 01:11:18,570
I'll build a computer and
download all my knowledge in it.

630
01:11:18,676 --> 01:11:21,741
I'll find a way for you
to have access to it.

631
01:11:22,096 --> 01:11:23,283
Yeah.

632
01:11:23,973 --> 01:11:27,287
I just hope we will be
worthy of your sacrifice.

633
01:11:37,485 --> 01:11:38,800
Nobody move!

634
01:11:56,005 --> 01:11:58,278
Do you understand English?

635
01:13:00,236 --> 01:13:01,591
What is she doing?

636
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:04,135
She's looking for energy and matter.

637
01:13:08,369 --> 01:13:11,768
And she's trying to connect
with our computers.

638
01:13:51,954 --> 01:13:54,227
- Chong-Ju!
- I'm here, boss.

639
01:13:54,622 --> 01:13:58,021
- Do something about them.
- Okay, boss!

640
01:13:59,587 --> 01:14:00,692
You guys, come on.

641
01:14:02,464 --> 01:14:03,570
Ready?

642
01:14:05,384 --> 01:14:06,489
You okay?

643
01:14:08,636 --> 01:14:10,368
Get a medic. Fast!

644
01:14:14,977 --> 01:14:16,708
Oh, my God. What's happening?

645
01:14:27,406 --> 01:14:31,847
- What is she making?
- New generation computer, I presume.

646
01:20:51,415 --> 01:20:52,520
Where is she?

647
01:20:56,794 --> 01:20:59,777
Where is she? Answer me.

648
01:21:00,591 --> 01:21:01,905
Answer me!

649
01:21:02,009 --> 01:21:03,406
Hey, you!

650
01:21:20,194 --> 01:21:22,674
Look. The computer, it's moving.

651
01:21:49,013 --> 01:21:52,330
Hey. Where is she?

652
01:22:21,421 --> 01:22:24,903
Life was given to
us a billion years ago.

653
01:22:25,091 --> 01:22:27,531
Now you know what to do with it.
