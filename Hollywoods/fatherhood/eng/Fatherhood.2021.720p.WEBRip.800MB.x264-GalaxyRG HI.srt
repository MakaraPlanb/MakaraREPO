Hey.

1952
01:40:11,989 --> 01:40:14,241
We were in the neighborhood,
so we figured we'd stop by.

1953
01:40:14,325 --> 01:40:15,325
No, we weren't.

1954
01:40:15,743 --> 01:40:17,623
- We were in the neighborhood.
- No, we weren't.

We weren't.

1956
01:40:19,496 --> 01:40:23,918
We were not in the area.
But I stopped, and I... I got some flowers

1957

1958
01:40:28,797 --> 01:40:31,842
I wanted to come and bring
the flowers by here and give them to you.

I didn't want you not to be here
then leave 'em on the step.

Then somebody come by,
they steal the flowers,

1961
01:40:36,472 --> 01:40:38,641
and you never get the flowers. You know--?

You know, there are a lot
of flower thieves in this building.
