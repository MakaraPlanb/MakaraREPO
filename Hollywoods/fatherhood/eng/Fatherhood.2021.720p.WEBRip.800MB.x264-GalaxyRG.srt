1
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:27,654
This sucks.

2
00:01:39,582 --> 00:01:41,543
You haven't seen Matt, have you?

3
00:01:41,626 --> 00:01:43,086
Yeah, I saw him go upstairs.

4
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,180
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

5
00:01:58,685 --> 00:01:59,853
Don't dress me.

6
00:02:00,562 --> 00:02:02,355
You're gonna be okay.

7
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:04,816
The both of you are gonna get through this

8
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:07,902
because the Lord has a plan for you.

9
00:02:07,986 --> 00:02:10,923
- I know, Mom. But don't put on my shoe.
- You're just gonna pick yourself up

10
00:02:10,947 --> 00:02:15,076
and be this wonderful, special guy
you've always been.

11
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,704
Yeah, I don't need you to tie my shoe.

12
00:02:18,413 --> 00:02:19,873
Don't tie it, Mom.

13
00:02:35,305 --> 00:02:36,514
We have to do this soon.

14
00:02:37,348 --> 00:02:38,628
What do you mean by soon?

15
00:02:38,683 --> 00:02:40,977
- The baby's not due for another two weeks.
- Yeah.

16
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:42,461
Your amniotic fluid's low,

17
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,899
and your daughter's already a healthy size.
So let's get her out.

18
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:49,069
- It's a girl.
- I heard her. I heard what she said.

19
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:51,154
Oh, sorry.
Were you waiting to find out?

20
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:53,448
You would've knew that
if you were our regular doctor,

21
00:02:53,531 --> 00:02:57,202
who chose this week of all weeks
to go to Maui, which is insane.

22
00:02:57,285 --> 00:02:58,912
Why not go bodysurf?

23
00:02:58,995 --> 00:03:00,914
You know, it's just our first kid.

24
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:04,042
Also, she's still breech, so I wanna
schedule a cesarean for this evening.

25
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,960
- For this evening?
- Mm-hmm.

26
00:03:06,044 --> 00:03:07,924
Well, I haven't even set up the crib.
I didn't--

27
00:03:08,004 --> 00:03:09,589
Are you serious?

28
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:13,134
See, I knew I should've taken care of it.
You told me to take it off my list.

29
00:03:13,218 --> 00:03:16,513
'Cause I wanted you to take it off your list.
I'm handling it. I got it.

30
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,139
That's really reassuring.

31
00:03:18,223 --> 00:03:20,943
- Honey, I'm handling it.
- Are you really ready for this?

32
00:03:20,975 --> 00:03:23,686
Yes! No-- Who's really ready?

33
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,440
Like, what does that mean when you say,
"Are you really ready for this?"

34
00:03:27,524 --> 00:03:29,692
This evening?
Can we do it tomorrow?

35
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:34,114
'Cause I got a fantasy football draft.
Um, me and some guys from work.

36
00:03:34,197 --> 00:03:36,449
We put
a nice little pool together, and we--

37
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:38,326
I'm kiddin'.
Why are you taking me serious?

38
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:40,169
Stop. Relax, honey, all right?

39
00:03:40,245 --> 00:03:42,455
That's a good one.

40
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:44,259
- All right.
- You good?

41
00:03:44,332 --> 00:03:45,792
Yeah, my hands started sweatin'.

42
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,001
- I know.
- Yeah.

43
00:03:47,085 --> 00:03:49,129
Whoo!

44
00:03:52,006 --> 00:03:54,300
Why couldn't you guys
give us adequate warning?

45
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:56,386
Well, we just thought
it'd be fun to surprise you.

46
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:59,556
We said, "You know, we should have
this baby tonight and mess with Marion."

47
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,618
- Love your sense of humor, Matt.
- Yeah, well, at least I got one. Bye-bye.

48
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:05,979
Oh, okay. Mom, we'll call you
as soon as it's over, okay? I love you.

49
00:04:06,062 --> 00:04:08,690
No, no!
Skype me while it's happening.

50
00:04:08,773 --> 00:04:11,359
- What? Mom!
- Okay, now we're just being weird.

51
00:04:11,442 --> 00:04:13,820
I want to be in the room with my daughter

52
00:04:13,903 --> 00:04:16,781
and to see my granddaughter
when she enters the world.

53
00:04:16,865 --> 00:04:18,491
Well, I'll be here to take care of her.

54
00:04:18,575 --> 00:04:20,451
Like you took care of Cousin Janey's baby?

55
00:04:20,535 --> 00:04:22,245
Mom, that is ancient history.

56
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,390
- Here we go. Here we go.
- Not that ancient.

57
00:04:24,414 --> 00:04:26,457
You don't put a baby on your lap

58
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,710
and then strap a seat belt over you

59
00:04:28,793 --> 00:04:32,881
in the passenger seat
in an automobile driving to 7-Eleven.

60
00:04:32,964 --> 00:04:35,693
I know you don't hold a baby
in your lap and strap a seat belt over you

61
00:04:35,717 --> 00:04:38,362
while you in the passenger seat
of an automobile driving to 7-Eleven.

62
00:04:38,386 --> 00:04:39,262
I know that!

63
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,181
Terrific. Skype me.

64
00:04:41,973 --> 00:04:44,267
Sweetie pie, Mommy will see you tomorrow.

65
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,311
- Okay, bye. Bye.
- I--

66
00:04:46,394 --> 00:04:49,147
Give Daddy a kiss, hmm?

67
00:04:50,148 --> 00:04:52,233
And a kiss from Mommy.

68
00:04:52,317 --> 00:04:53,317
Two kisses.

69
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,111
- Wake up.
- Oh my God.

70
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:56,696
I'm ready. I'm ready to dance.

71
00:05:05,413 --> 00:05:06,831
- Matt. Hey, man.
- Hey.

72
00:05:06,915 --> 00:05:07,915
What's goin' on?

73
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,877
Oh hey,
stay away from that tuna casserole.

74
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,546
The one in the middle tastes like ass.

75
00:05:15,298 --> 00:05:17,300
My mom made that casserole, Oscar.

76
00:05:18,426 --> 00:05:23,139
It's really good.
It's really... It's got, like, a tang.

77
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:26,184
- It's all right, man. It's okay.
- Like a tangy--

78
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:29,187
Come here.

79
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:31,231
Matt.

80
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:32,857
- Jordan, I don't--
- Come here.

81
00:05:32,941 --> 00:05:35,109
Nope, come here.
Bring it in. You need this.

82
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:37,736
Bring it in.

83
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,823
Let it out. Breathe, breathe.

84
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,826
Come on, man.

85
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,621
Let me tell you something.
That speech--

86
00:05:46,704 --> 00:05:47,622
Your speech.

87
00:05:47,705 --> 00:05:51,084
You went up there, and you talked.

88
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:56,464
I don't, um...

89
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:01,844
I don't know what to say.

90
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,682
I... I would've assumed
you'd have written something,

91
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,934
but you said, "No, I'm freestyling this."

92
00:06:08,017 --> 00:06:11,187
Okay, we done?
'Cause I can't do this right now.

93
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,982
- Please.
- No. Nope, Matt. Look at me.

94
00:06:14,065 --> 00:06:16,693
- You can, and let me tell you why.
- You're not listening to me.

95
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:19,136
Remember Camp Winapoo?
You remember we went to Camp Winapoo?

96
00:06:19,195 --> 00:06:21,531
- I do.
- And you got the poison ivy in your face.

97
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:24,468
Your face started blistering.
It was... it was bubbling, and the bumps...

98
00:06:24,492 --> 00:06:27,203
Then the bumps was poppin',
so you had pus comin' out of your face.

99
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:28,871
And you looked crazy as hell, right?

100
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,955
You came to lunch,
and your crush was there, Marcy.

101
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:32,333
You used to love Marcy.

102
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:35,211
And when she saw him, she screamed.

103
00:06:36,254 --> 00:06:38,256
- And you was devastated.
- Yeah.

104
00:06:38,923 --> 00:06:40,383
- But you got through that.
- Yeah.

105
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:41,301
You got through that?

106
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:44,095
Because you're strong and confident.

107
00:06:44,178 --> 00:06:45,847
And you'll get through this too.

108
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:50,935
This is so much worse than that.

109
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,563
How is that the same?

110
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,898
- I'm just trying--
- I promise you--

111
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,776
I'mma punch you in the face.
Don't say nothin' else to me.

112
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,278
- Wow--
- I told you I can't.

113
00:07:01,612 --> 00:07:02,613
Jordan, I swear to God.

114
00:07:02,697 --> 00:07:04,824
- Why you ballin' up your fists?
- Swear to God. Stop.

115
00:07:13,124 --> 00:07:14,751
- How do you feel?
- Good.

116
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,878
- It's gonna be okay, all right?
- Okay.

117
00:07:16,961 --> 00:07:18,212
I love you so much.

118
00:07:18,296 --> 00:07:21,507
- I love my anesthesiologist.
- Stop it. Stop playin'.

119
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:25,136
- You're so beautiful.
- Matt! Matt!

120
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:26,054
Yes, Marion?

121
00:07:26,137 --> 00:07:27,722
I can't see. Come on!

122
00:07:27,805 --> 00:07:30,433
You're doing great, Liz.
Might wanna look away now, Matt.

123
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:33,269
It's happening.
I wanna look, but I don't wanna look.

124
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:36,397
But I do wanna look,
but I don't want to look.

125
00:07:36,481 --> 00:07:40,193
- You're doing great.
- Oh my God. We about to be parents.

126
00:07:41,444 --> 00:07:43,613
- I love you.
- I love you too.

127
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:47,158
Okay? How we doin', doc?

128
00:07:47,241 --> 00:07:48,801
- Here she comes.
- See the baby?

129
00:07:48,826 --> 00:07:50,912
- I do.
- Oh my God, Liz.

130
00:07:50,995 --> 00:07:52,715
And there she is.

131
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,084
We got a baby.

132
00:08:51,806 --> 00:08:52,806
Um...

133
00:08:53,474 --> 00:08:54,559
I just wanted to, uh...

134
00:08:54,642 --> 00:08:56,436
- Matt.
- Mmm.

135
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,521
Oh, you didn't have to.

136
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:01,023
I know I didn't have to.
I wanted to, 'cause you deserve it.

137
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,900
It's beautiful. Thank you.

138
00:09:02,984 --> 00:09:05,570
- Let me put it on you.
- Thank you.

139
00:09:05,653 --> 00:09:07,947
- Mmm!
- You're still gonna have to do diapers.

140
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,992
As long as they promise to change
my diapers when I get old, I'm happy.

141
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,537
- Love you. Thank you.
- Love you. How you feelin'?

142
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,205
A little sore but--

143
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,499
- How are you doing, Liz?
- I wanna see Maddy.

144
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,459
Hey.

145
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:21,419
I thought you might.

146
00:09:22,503 --> 00:09:24,743
Matt, I'm gonna need you
to come around here and help me.

147
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,008
- Gladly.
- She's gonna be a bit wobbly.

148
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:28,986
- Okay.
- We're gonna take this slow, okay?

149
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,928
Take your time. Take your time.

150
00:09:31,012 --> 00:09:34,474
- Let's get you to the chair. Easy, easy.
- Ready for a 10K.

151
00:09:35,516 --> 00:09:37,435
- All right.
- Guys, I feel light-headed.

152
00:09:37,518 --> 00:09:39,520
Take your time, honey.
Take your--

153
00:09:39,604 --> 00:09:43,941
Liz? Liz? Liz? What's wrong with her?

154
00:09:44,025 --> 00:09:46,253
- Was she dizzy earlier?
- What's wrong? Liz? I don't know!

155
00:09:46,277 --> 00:09:47,904
- Liz?
- She's having trouble breathing.

156
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,798
- What do you mean?
- I'm gonna get help.

157
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,157
- Look at me!
- Medical emergency!

158
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,700
Liz! Liz! Look at me!

159
00:09:52,783 --> 00:09:54,423
- Give her space.
- What's wrong with her?

160
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:56,014
- Liz?
- I need an oxygen mask!

161
00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:57,306
- Liz!
- Can you hear me?

162
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,170
- I need you to step back now!
- Wait a minute.

163
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:00,847
- That's my wife.
- She collapsed.

164
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,020
- There were no precursory signs.
- What's goin' on? Liz!

165
00:10:03,044 --> 00:10:04,938
- That is my wife!
- Her pressure dropped.

166
00:10:04,962 --> 00:10:08,591
- Two milligrams of epi.
- Wait a minute, man. Liz! Wait a-- Liz!

167
00:10:17,808 --> 00:10:18,643
Mr. Logelin.

168
00:10:18,726 --> 00:10:22,021
Hey. What's up, doc?
What's... what's goin' on, man?

169
00:10:22,104 --> 00:10:24,982
Your wife had a pulmonary embolism.

170
00:10:25,066 --> 00:10:27,318
Uh, a blood clot traveled to her lung.

171
00:10:27,401 --> 00:10:28,402
What does that mean?

172
00:10:29,737 --> 00:10:30,737
What's that mea--

173
00:10:45,628 --> 00:10:48,130
Don't tell me my wife is dead.

174
00:10:48,673 --> 00:10:52,218
- Don't tell me my wife is dead.
- What? What? What?

175
00:10:52,301 --> 00:10:56,472
What is it? Is it Maddy? What?
Jus-- Matt!

176
00:11:00,184 --> 00:11:05,356
No! No!

177
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:27,586
How?

178
00:11:47,231 --> 00:11:50,109
I would trade everything
to spend one more day with you.

179
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,709
Here she is.

180
00:12:38,282 --> 00:12:40,159
He's not ready for a baby.

181
00:12:40,242 --> 00:12:42,119
He hasn't even put the crib together.

182
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:45,831
Well, you know,
he's always been extremely immature.

183
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,001
Oh, hi, Matt. How are you, dear?

184
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:50,419
I'm extremely immature.

185
00:12:53,255 --> 00:12:55,925
- Can you give the baby, please?
- I just gave her a bottle.

186
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,008
Okay.

187
00:13:05,142 --> 00:13:06,227
You know, Maddy,

188
00:13:07,978 --> 00:13:11,357
if you could have only one parent,
I wish you could've had your mom.

189
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,239
'Cause she would've been better at it.

190
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,537
I think sooner than later.

191
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,335
I don't know.

192
00:13:32,294 --> 00:13:33,462
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

193
00:13:34,255 --> 00:13:35,255
Mmm, mmm, hmm?

194
00:13:35,798 --> 00:13:37,550
I don't know how he gonna do this.

195
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,886
- I know.
- See? Will you tell him that?

196
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:45,223
Nah.

197
00:13:55,484 --> 00:13:57,361
All right! All right, Maddy!

198
00:13:57,445 --> 00:14:00,740
Okay. You win. You win, Maddy.

199
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:05,244
Tell me what it is. Are you hungry? Huh?

200
00:14:05,327 --> 00:14:07,079
You want your diaper changed again?

201
00:14:13,294 --> 00:14:14,920
Okay. Wait a second.

202
00:14:16,505 --> 00:14:17,590
Hold on, Maddy.

203
00:14:18,215 --> 00:14:20,134
Okay. Here.

204
00:14:20,843 --> 00:14:22,720
All right. Okay.

205
00:14:22,803 --> 00:14:26,015
All right, all right. Huh?
Wait, I didn't get it all.

206
00:14:26,724 --> 00:14:29,643
Oh my G-- Shit!

207
00:14:34,857 --> 00:14:36,901
What are you doin' up?

208
00:14:36,984 --> 00:14:40,362
I probably will never sleep again.

209
00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:43,991
What is that on that baby's bottom?

210
00:14:45,576 --> 00:14:46,452
It's a diaper.

211
00:14:46,535 --> 00:14:48,287
It looks like a balloon animal.

212
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,873
- Is it inside out?
- The diaper's on fine.

213
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,958
I just came down to give her a bottle.

214
00:14:54,376 --> 00:14:56,962
Already done. We heard her crying.

215
00:14:57,505 --> 00:14:59,632
- Mm-hmm. Give her some.
- Mm-hmm.

216
00:15:02,551 --> 00:15:05,721
There you go. There you go.

217
00:15:06,847 --> 00:15:08,390
Matthew, darling, we've been talking--

218
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,267
We think
you should move back to Minnesota.

219
00:15:11,435 --> 00:15:14,563
- It's financially prudent.
- It is. You can find a job there.

220
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:17,566
Your mom and I can help you raise Maddy.

221
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,444
We'll all be together.
You'll have a church, a support system.

222
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:23,697
- You're all alone here.
- I'm not alone, okay? My job is here.

223
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:28,494
There are no good tech jobs at home.
My friends are here.

224
00:15:28,577 --> 00:15:30,162
Your friends are kind of weird.

225
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:33,207
Okay. That may be true,
but they're my friends, Ma.

226
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,750
Liz is here.

227
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:39,213
And every place that I look here,
every single place that I look

228
00:15:39,296 --> 00:15:40,422
makes me think of her.

229
00:15:41,215 --> 00:15:43,133
Mom, you always talk
to me about God's plan.

230
00:15:43,217 --> 00:15:45,010
I would love to know what the odds are

231
00:15:45,094 --> 00:15:48,013
of me meetin' somebody from my hometown
halfway across the country.

232
00:15:48,097 --> 00:15:49,181
God?

233
00:15:49,265 --> 00:15:50,766
I had a plan.

234
00:15:51,392 --> 00:15:54,687
Liz was to go away to grad school
and then come back and work and live.

235
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,189
That was the plan before she met you.

236
00:15:57,273 --> 00:16:01,944
Now, you want to stay, do that,
but Maddy comes with us.

237
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,822
- Marion, it's--
- It's the best thing for her.

238
00:16:04,905 --> 00:16:08,367
Believe it or not, it's best for you too.
I care about you.

239
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:11,871
You think you can do this, but you can't.

240
00:16:11,954 --> 00:16:15,833
Raisin' a child, that's a...
that's a nonstop, all-day, all-night affair.

241
00:16:18,836 --> 00:16:22,798
I understand,
and I'll... I'll think about it.

242
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:25,259
Okay.

243
00:16:31,015 --> 00:16:33,100
I thought about it.

244
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:37,646
Yeah, I just... I just thought about it.
You're right.

245
00:16:38,188 --> 00:16:42,109
No, Marion, you're right. I can't.
I... I can't do it. But you know what?

246
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:44,069
I'm gonna do it.

247
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,323
Yeah, I'm... I'mma do it.
I'm gonna bring Maddy up.

248
00:16:47,823 --> 00:16:51,327
I'm... I'mma bring Maddy up
because I'm her father.

249
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,704
- And because I love her.
- I know you love her.

250
00:16:53,787 --> 00:16:56,627
Do you know that I love her, Marion,
because I doubt that you really do.

251
00:16:56,665 --> 00:16:58,959
I have no doubt you love that baby.

252
00:16:59,043 --> 00:17:01,629
I have no doubt you loved my Liz.

253
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,133
But you wanna keep Maddy to yourself
because you need a life raft.

254
00:17:07,676 --> 00:17:09,303
I'm sorry I messed up your plan.

255
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:19,939
You catch more flies
with honey than with vinegar.

256
00:17:20,022 --> 00:17:22,066
You catch even more with a flyswatter.

257
00:17:22,149 --> 00:17:23,150
Marion!

258
00:17:24,026 --> 00:17:28,948
If there's one piece of advice that
I could give you about bringing up a kid...

259
00:17:33,077 --> 00:17:34,286
Let go.

260
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:38,540
Look, as a parent,
we do all this shit, right?

261
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,543
Trying to make everything perfect.

262
00:17:42,503 --> 00:17:44,838
But we don't have any control.

263
00:17:45,506 --> 00:17:47,299
You just have to accept that fact.

264
00:17:51,095 --> 00:17:52,221
Liz loved you.

265
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,808
And it made me happy to see that.

266
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,603
And I also saw how much you loved her.

267
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,901
Yeah.

268
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:08,278
You are a, um...

269
00:18:10,781 --> 00:18:12,032
You're a good father.

270
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,745
She was lucky to have you, Mike.

271
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:19,540
Thanks.

272
00:18:23,377 --> 00:18:24,377
Hmm.

273
00:18:45,983 --> 00:18:48,235
I had an aunt who died this past year.

274
00:18:48,318 --> 00:18:49,318
She was 99.

275
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:53,032
Wow. That, uh...
that must've been a shock.

276
00:18:53,115 --> 00:18:54,115
It was.

277
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:58,120
Listen, I want you to take as much time...

278
00:18:58,203 --> 00:18:59,038
Okay.

279
00:18:59,121 --> 00:18:59,997
...as you need.

280
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,832
- Thank you.
- Five weeks, six weeks.

281
00:19:01,915 --> 00:19:03,292
I don-- Whatever.

282
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,127
I'll probably need about ten,

283
00:19:06,295 --> 00:19:07,546
twenty years.

284
00:19:07,629 --> 00:19:10,257
- Well, yeah...
- That would do it, but I... I need my job.

285
00:19:11,175 --> 00:19:14,261
You know? That's why
I can't, uh... I can't have that time.

286
00:19:14,344 --> 00:19:17,389
Listen, Howard, I was thinking
maybe I could just work from home

287
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,768
and... and come in as you need me.
You know?

288
00:19:20,851 --> 00:19:23,187
And when I come in,
I'd have to bring my daughter with me.

289
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,773
- You're taking care of her?
- That's correct.

290
00:19:25,856 --> 00:19:28,108
All right. Good.
Great. Okay.

291
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,111
You don't think I can do it.

292
00:19:31,195 --> 00:19:32,955
It's not that I don't think you can do it...

293
00:19:32,988 --> 00:19:35,115
- Because I'm a man?
- No.

294
00:19:35,199 --> 00:19:37,239
See, what is it
that a woman has that a man doesn't?

295
00:19:37,284 --> 00:19:40,788
Patience. Emotional vulnerability.

296
00:19:41,288 --> 00:19:42,456
Uh...

297
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:43,415
Breasts.

298
00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:44,625
Some men have breasts.

299
00:19:45,876 --> 00:19:47,669
I'm gonna let that go
'cause you're grieving.

300
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,838
Listen, I love babies.

301
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:52,174
You know, I have three of them myself.

302
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:55,844
They're not babies anymore in the picture,
but when they started, they were babies.

303
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:58,097
And I'm tellin' ya, it's brutal.

304
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,140
It'll wipe you out.

305
00:20:00,224 --> 00:20:01,517
She have solid poops yet?

306
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,643
No. Nope.

307
00:20:02,726 --> 00:20:05,312
I'm, uh... I'm dealing with
the creamy shit right now.

308
00:20:05,395 --> 00:20:07,689
Enjoy the creamy shit.
It's a big jump.

309
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:10,317
When you get to solid poops,
it's not a picnic.

310
00:20:10,901 --> 00:20:11,735
Okay.

311
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:14,863
Save that. Put it in the...
with your roses and your flowers

312
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,199
'cause it's packed with nutrients,
that stuff.

313
00:20:18,075 --> 00:20:20,619
- That's-- It's... it's a great tip.
- Yeah.

314
00:20:20,702 --> 00:20:22,764
The London account,
I know it's comin' up in five weeks.

315
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:25,165
I just wanna tell you, I'm on it.

316
00:20:25,249 --> 00:20:29,378
You know, I'm more than capable
of doin' the job that needs to be done.

317
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,964
You know, but if you feel
like I'm... I'm not or I can't be,

318
00:20:32,047 --> 00:20:33,327
maybe you could put Oscar on it.

319
00:20:33,382 --> 00:20:35,092
- Jesus Christ. Oscar?
- And see-- Yeah.

320
00:20:35,175 --> 00:20:38,262
No, no, no, no.
Nah, no, no. Forget Oscar.

321
00:20:38,345 --> 00:20:39,513
- Did you ask him?
- Um...

322
00:20:39,596 --> 00:20:42,099
Did you ask him,
"Do you want Oscar to handle the clients?"

323
00:20:42,182 --> 00:20:43,910
- Yeah. I did.
- Remember? Like we rehearsed?

324
00:20:43,934 --> 00:20:45,769
I said it, Oscar. It worked.

325
00:20:45,853 --> 00:20:48,397
- I told you it would. That's great news.
- Yeah. Yeah. D--

326
00:20:52,943 --> 00:20:55,654
It's kind of cruel
to send flowers to someone who's grieving.

327
00:20:56,238 --> 00:21:00,534
'Cause, you know, flowers die,
and then you gotta throw them out.

328
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,619
It's just such a bummer.

329
00:21:03,287 --> 00:21:07,332
You know, I've never seen,
like, a... like, a person pass or anything.

330
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,835
But, um, you know,
I've seen a squirrel pass.

331
00:21:09,918 --> 00:21:11,678
It makes you wonder
about the circle of life.

332
00:21:11,753 --> 00:21:13,755
But it's not really a circle.
It's like a line.

333
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,508
- 'Cause there's a beginning and an end.
- Hey, Oscar.

334
00:21:18,427 --> 00:21:19,803
Can you stop talking?

335
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,181
Man, you sound just like my wife.

336
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:29,062
You're gonna swaddle Maddy, aren't you?

337
00:21:29,146 --> 00:21:30,689
Did you swaddle Liz?

338
00:21:30,772 --> 00:21:31,772
I sure did.

339
00:21:31,815 --> 00:21:34,818
Then, yeah, I mean, I'mma do
whatever Liz would've wanted me to do.

340
00:21:35,652 --> 00:21:38,530
But this... this looks insane.

341
00:21:38,614 --> 00:21:41,200
I mean, that's...
that's tight there, Marion.

342
00:21:41,283 --> 00:21:43,344
What, do you think
she's gonna run away or somethin'?

343
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,662
- Hmm.
- What up?

344
00:21:45,746 --> 00:21:46,955
How you doin'?

345
00:21:47,664 --> 00:21:48,957
These are Flamin' Hots.

346
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:52,294
Anybody want some? Grandmas?
Want me to give one to the baby? Mmm.

347
00:21:52,836 --> 00:21:54,880
Y'all lookin' good, ladies.
Can I say that to you?

348
00:21:54,963 --> 00:21:56,340
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

349
00:21:56,423 --> 00:21:57,966
- No problem. You know--
- Stop it.

350
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:02,179
- Your pajama-robe thingy...
- Jordan. Stop it.

351
00:22:02,262 --> 00:22:03,096
What am I doin'?

352
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,200
- You're flirtin' with my mother.
- I'm not flirtin'.

353
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:06,744
I'm looking at you flirt with my mama.

354
00:22:06,808 --> 00:22:10,812
I'm flirtin' with both your mamas.
Hey, Marion, how you doin'? Looking good.

355
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:12,856
- Jordan.
- Kind of a blouse-sweater, huh?

356
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,525
Jordan, stop it.

357
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,671
- I can't help your mom is a GILF.
- That's it.

358
00:22:18,695 --> 00:22:19,964
- Yeah, I said it.
- Stop.

359
00:22:19,988 --> 00:22:22,588
Look, man, I got a... a present for you.
Can I give you a present?

360
00:22:22,658 --> 00:22:25,160
Wait right here. I'll be right back.
I got somethin' for you.

361
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:27,496
We've been makin' a list.
We need onesies.

362
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:31,500
And you need a lock. A toilet lock.
You know, they can drown in the toilet.

363
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:32,583
Look,

364
00:22:33,377 --> 00:22:36,129
I've been meaning to ask, wh--
How long... how long are you stayin'?

365
00:22:36,213 --> 00:22:38,983
- I wish I didn't have to go back--
- I'm not talking to you, Mom.

366
00:22:39,007 --> 00:22:43,136
We've discussed that. But, Marion,
I wasn't a hundred percent sure about you.

367
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:47,849
Well, since you refuse to move back
to Minnesota, I'll stay six months.

368
00:22:50,143 --> 00:22:51,144
Six months?

369
00:22:51,228 --> 00:22:53,563
- Yes.
- What about Mike?

370
00:22:53,647 --> 00:22:55,774
Oh, I don't care about Mike right now.

371
00:22:55,857 --> 00:22:56,858
Hey, Matt.

372
00:22:58,151 --> 00:23:01,238
Hey, uh, Mike. How you doin', man?

373
00:23:01,321 --> 00:23:02,864
- Doin' well, man.
- Okay.

374
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:06,118
I want us to be honest for a second.

375
00:23:06,201 --> 00:23:07,828
Okay, let's be honest.

376
00:23:09,663 --> 00:23:12,165
The first thing I want to say
is that I love havin' you here.

377
00:23:12,249 --> 00:23:13,249
I know you do.

378
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:14,793
No, I... I love it.

379
00:23:14,876 --> 00:23:18,547
But what worries me is
that if you're here...

380
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,967
you know, if you're... if you're here
for an extended period of time,

381
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,344
we're gonna end up
gettin' on each other's nerves.

382
00:23:24,428 --> 00:23:25,512
In just six months?

383
00:23:25,595 --> 00:23:28,682
That's why I was thinking
maybe you could leave when my mom leaves.

384
00:23:28,765 --> 00:23:32,728
What would I look like goin' home
before I know that you are capable

385
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:34,896
of taking care of my newborn grandchild?

386
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,607
How are you ever gonna know
if you don't let me do it?

387
00:23:37,691 --> 00:23:39,901
That is a great damn point.

388
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:43,488
Huh? Forty-love.

389
00:23:43,572 --> 00:23:46,658
Forty-love, Matt. Here you go, brother.
Look what I got for you, huh?

390
00:23:46,742 --> 00:23:47,742
What is that, Jordan?

391
00:23:47,784 --> 00:23:49,453
- I got you a pet.
- That's a goldfish.

392
00:23:49,536 --> 00:23:53,457
And let me tell you somethin',
kids with pets are really happy.

393
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,959
Also, they don't get any allergies.
Did you know that?

394
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,878
That's cats and dogs.

395
00:24:00,088 --> 00:24:03,133
- Damn it, you read the same article.
- Okay. Jordan, this is... this is--

396
00:24:03,216 --> 00:24:05,427
All right,
I'm bullshitting you, man.

397
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,012
I'm sorry. Excuse my French.

398
00:24:07,095 --> 00:24:09,449
I hate this fish.
You remember Tanya? She gave me this fish.

399
00:24:09,473 --> 00:24:13,226
Tanya broke up with me
and left this dirty-ass fish in my house.

400
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,895
Can you take me to the baby store?

401
00:24:16,563 --> 00:24:17,439
- Hell yeah!
- Thank you.

402
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:20,317
Team Single Father! I'm here
to help you at the end of the day.

403
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,862
Thank you.
Okay, Marion. How about we do this?

404
00:24:23,945 --> 00:24:26,782
How about... how about,
when you go back, right,

405
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:29,951
I promise to give you updates,
let you know how Maddy's doin'?

406
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,746
Uh, I'll post pictures
on my Instagram all the time.

407
00:24:32,829 --> 00:24:33,747
All right.

408
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,625
I will go home when Anna goes.

409
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:41,296
But if you are not handling
everything all very well,

410
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,590
you move your butt back to Minnesota.

411
00:24:43,673 --> 00:24:47,135
- Why would I agree to that?
- Because it's not about you.

412
00:24:49,262 --> 00:24:51,098
- Deal.
- Brother, real quick.

413
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,893
- You good on the fish?
- I don't want the fish, man.

414
00:24:54,976 --> 00:24:56,412
- How you doin'?
- Good. You?

415
00:24:56,436 --> 00:24:58,230
I'm doin' fine. Here you go.

416
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,357
- These are great.
- Oh, well...

417
00:25:01,483 --> 00:25:04,653
You better stop smilin' at me like that.
Here you go.

418
00:25:06,613 --> 00:25:08,490
I don't have no kids.
This is for my friend.

419
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:11,410
This for his baby.
You know, man, he's buyin' all this stuff.

420
00:25:11,493 --> 00:25:13,912
He's paying for everything.

421
00:25:14,704 --> 00:25:15,914
Oh, here we go.

422
00:25:15,997 --> 00:25:19,835
This is, uh... this is
your diaper rash ointment for you.

423
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:23,004
This one's Maddy's.
Just do... do his separate.

424
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:25,006
Here. Just put yours over there

425
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,676
so she knows that you
have to pay for the stuff that you got

426
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,511
for your problem by yourself.

427
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,474
And this one's the one
I'm paying for for Maddy.

428
00:25:31,555 --> 00:25:33,765
- That's yours. This is Maddy's.
- Okay.

429
00:25:33,849 --> 00:25:35,559
He says situa-- I mean...

430
00:25:36,143 --> 00:25:38,979
- Bumps.
- Bumps. But it's... it's shavin' bumps.

431
00:25:39,062 --> 00:25:40,702
- On your butt.
- Not on my butt.

432
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:43,942
- I have shavin' bumps from shavin' and--
- On your...

433
00:25:44,025 --> 00:25:46,194
And I saw a video

434
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:49,990
that people use diaper rash ointment
to keep their skin clear

435
00:25:50,073 --> 00:25:52,593
from gaining shavin' bumps.
That's why I got such a smooth neck.

436
00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:53,994
- Look how--
- You look great...

437
00:25:54,077 --> 00:25:54,911
- I look great?
- Yeah.

438
00:25:54,995 --> 00:25:56,872
See, look at that.
Yeah, she said I look great.

439
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:58,165
Ask to see his butt.

440
00:25:59,332 --> 00:26:03,712
"Now insert
the eighth 44-millimeter screw."

441
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:10,886
I don't see it. I don't see
the eighth 4... 44-millimeter screw.

442
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:11,845
I don't see it.

443
00:26:11,928 --> 00:26:16,016
You're not even looking for real.
Look... look next to your shoe. Look.

444
00:26:17,726 --> 00:26:18,560
Okay.

445
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:21,104
Why do you keep acting like you dumb, huh?

446
00:26:21,188 --> 00:26:23,148
Because I didn't see it,
I'm acting like I'm dumb?

447
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,150
You acting like
a dumb mother-fudger right now.

448
00:26:25,233 --> 00:26:28,337
- Don't cuss at me in front of my child.
- I didn't. I called you a mother-fudger.

449
00:26:28,361 --> 00:26:29,488
Why are you sayin' "fudge"?

450
00:26:29,571 --> 00:26:31,811
There's a baby.
I don't wanna curse in front of the baby.

451
00:26:31,865 --> 00:26:33,533
So why not just choose another word?

452
00:26:33,617 --> 00:26:34,618
I did. "Fudge."

453
00:26:35,452 --> 00:26:37,996
Man. You know, your daddy is a witch.

454
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:40,916
Yeah, I said it. He's a dumbass witch.

455
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:44,294
Goofy mother-fudger.

456
00:26:48,757 --> 00:26:50,175
See, it's not...

457
00:26:51,801 --> 00:26:53,470
Just reach under and flip the switch.

458
00:26:53,553 --> 00:26:55,347
I did reach under. It's broken.

459
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,973
You've always been so impatient.

460
00:26:57,057 --> 00:26:59,267
Stop. This ain't got nothin'
to do with patience!

461
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,978
I'm telling you I'm trying to do it,
and you just-- I can't!

462
00:27:02,062 --> 00:27:03,522
I can't, Mom!

463
00:27:04,272 --> 00:27:05,272
Shit.

464
00:27:06,274 --> 00:27:07,609
I can't do none of it.

465
00:27:09,402 --> 00:27:10,403
I can't do it.

466
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,906
Not without Liz.

467
00:27:13,823 --> 00:27:17,160
You just have to do what's best for her.

468
00:27:17,244 --> 00:27:19,996
That's all you have to do
the rest of your life.

469
00:27:20,664 --> 00:27:22,457
And I believe you can do that.

470
00:27:33,176 --> 00:27:34,176
Right here.

471
00:27:35,262 --> 00:27:36,262
Show-off.

472
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:40,597
I'm gonna be praying for you ten times a day.

473
00:27:40,642 --> 00:27:43,103
Listen, if it's nine,
don't kill yourself, okay?

474
00:27:43,186 --> 00:27:44,688
Love you, Mom.

475
00:27:44,771 --> 00:27:46,982
- That's real lucky.
- "Goodbye, Nana."

476
00:27:47,816 --> 00:27:49,442
- Come, come, come.
- You got her?

477
00:27:50,277 --> 00:27:51,278
We have a deal now.

478
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:56,741
If it's in her best interest,
you're moving back. Okay?

479
00:27:56,825 --> 00:27:57,867
No being selfish.

480
00:27:58,451 --> 00:27:59,451
Agreed.

481
00:28:06,001 --> 00:28:07,627
- Love you!
- Good luck.

482
00:28:07,711 --> 00:28:10,547
I love you, Maddy.
Grammy loves you.

483
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,799
- Bye!
- Bye!

484
00:28:18,138 --> 00:28:20,223
Mmm!

485
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:22,475
Oh. Hey.

486
00:28:23,351 --> 00:28:24,561
Hey, hey.

487
00:28:30,734 --> 00:28:32,444
Mmm. Mmm.

488
00:28:34,487 --> 00:28:36,948
- Daddy in a sling. Look at that.
- How do I look?

489
00:28:37,032 --> 00:28:38,450
You look great. Like a king.

490
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:41,536
- Don't say it just to be sayin' it, man.
- You look like a king.

491
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,705
- You gotta buckle it.
- Push it down.

492
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:45,665
- I'm pushin' down.
- I'm pushing my side down.

493
00:28:45,749 --> 00:28:48,084
- So buckle it.
- No, but it's still wobbly.

494
00:28:48,168 --> 00:28:52,088
Fellas! Fellas! Okay, have you
even attached the third anchor latch? Huh?

495
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:57,010
Oh my God. Oh no, no, no, Maddy.

496
00:28:57,093 --> 00:28:59,054
I'm sorry. Daddy's sorry.

497
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,138
Booyah!

498
00:29:00,221 --> 00:29:01,221
Come on.

499
00:29:02,515 --> 00:29:04,684
- That's in there. That's sturdy.
- That's steady.

500
00:29:04,768 --> 00:29:06,645
- Thank you.
- I was a nanny for four years.

501
00:29:06,728 --> 00:29:07,937
Wait, wait.

502
00:29:08,021 --> 00:29:09,064
What?

503
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:10,273
She's awake, man.

504
00:29:10,357 --> 00:29:12,692
- No, she ain't.
- Yes, she is. I just heard her.

505
00:29:12,776 --> 00:29:15,028
- I don't have a bottle, man.
- Oh man.

506
00:29:15,111 --> 00:29:17,530
Here's the formula. All right.

507
00:29:19,616 --> 00:29:21,034
You just cut the top.

508
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:26,164
You were so hungry.
You were so hungry.

509
00:29:49,562 --> 00:29:50,562
Ha!

510
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:52,607
Hiyo!

511
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:55,151
Oh, where's mom?

512
00:29:55,235 --> 00:29:57,404
Oh, mom's an astronaut trainin' at NASA.

513
00:29:57,487 --> 00:29:58,988
Where is mom today?

514
00:29:59,072 --> 00:30:01,324
Oh, mom is servin' time in San Quentin.

515
00:30:01,408 --> 00:30:02,450
Where's her mom?

516
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:06,996
Me, I can't wait till Monday comes
so I can get away from my kids screaming.

517
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,915
Wow. I bet they're probably psyched

518
00:30:08,998 --> 00:30:10,250
to get away from you too.

519
00:30:17,716 --> 00:30:18,716
Mmm.

520
00:30:48,121 --> 00:30:49,539
We brought you some flowers.

521
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:55,670
Oh, I thought I should tell you
that you got one of your wishes.

522
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:58,381
I'm changing a lot of diapers.

523
00:30:59,716 --> 00:31:01,843
This little kid here poops a lot.

524
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,596
Mm-hmm.

525
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:06,765
Mmm.

526
00:31:09,851 --> 00:31:10,852
Cute baby, papi.

527
00:31:12,228 --> 00:31:14,230
- Hey, you mind if I...
- Yeah, sure.

528
00:31:15,982 --> 00:31:17,192
- Thanks, man.
- All right.

529
00:31:17,984 --> 00:31:19,027
Mmm.

530
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:22,739
Look, Maddy, we're about to pass
the school that Mom wanted you to go to.

531
00:31:23,656 --> 00:31:25,784
Which means
that that's where you gonna go.

532
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,745
They got nuns there, and you'll like nuns.

533
00:31:29,496 --> 00:31:32,832
You'll like nuns 'cause nuns
dress like penguins. That's a fact.

534
00:31:32,916 --> 00:31:34,000
And they're celibate.

535
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:37,462
I know. I know.

536
00:31:37,545 --> 00:31:39,130
I know, you fussin'.

537
00:31:39,214 --> 00:31:41,674
I know you don't wanna be celibate,
but you're gonna be.

538
00:31:43,009 --> 00:31:44,009
Good talk.

539
00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:00,193
Come on, Maddy.

540
00:32:00,276 --> 00:32:02,987
What? What? What? What? What? What? What?

541
00:32:03,071 --> 00:32:05,073
Roller coaster. Come on, Maddy.

542
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:08,034
Here it is. Goin' down this track.

543
00:32:08,743 --> 00:32:11,913
Goin' down.
It's gettin' rocky and shocky.

544
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:23,341
No, Mom. Listen to me.
You don't understand.

545
00:32:23,424 --> 00:32:28,179
I'm seri-- It's just, like,
she will not stop cryin'. She won't.

546
00:32:28,263 --> 00:32:30,723
Well, sometimes I would sing
you a little lullaby,

547
00:32:30,807 --> 00:32:32,433
and that would quiet you right down.

548
00:32:44,988 --> 00:32:46,823
Try to sing higher.

549
00:32:51,744 --> 00:32:54,664
It's not working, though.

550
00:32:56,833 --> 00:32:59,210
Oh no, that's-- No, that made it worse.

551
00:32:59,294 --> 00:33:00,128
That-- Well...

552
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:01,129
She's not a clapper.

553
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:03,965
- She just won't stop.
- Listen to your daddy!

554
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:06,509
Your daddy said go to bed, Maddy.

555
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,929
Your father is tired.

556
00:33:10,013 --> 00:33:12,432
- That's not abuse. Yeah, that's not abuse.
- Yep.

557
00:33:12,515 --> 00:33:13,349
That's borderline.

558
00:33:13,433 --> 00:33:16,394
My nipples are so cracked,
I'm scared to even look at them.

559
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:21,441
Is it weird that breastfeeding
kind of turns me on a little bit?

560
00:33:21,524 --> 00:33:23,234
My husband wants sex.

561
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,487
I just want him to die.
Is that wrong?

562
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:28,406
No.

563
00:33:30,116 --> 00:33:31,117
Excuse me.

564
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,162
Um, I'm sorry.
AA is down the hall to the right.

565
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:35,288
I'm not here for that.

566
00:33:35,371 --> 00:33:37,933
I'm not... I'm not here for the AA meeting.
That's not why I'm here.

567
00:33:37,957 --> 00:33:43,296
She, uh... she just went to sleep,
but she's been, like, crying for hours.

568
00:33:43,379 --> 00:33:46,591
I mean hours to the point
where I'm... I'm exhausted.

569
00:33:46,716 --> 00:33:48,551
And my face hurts,
and I'm getting frustrated.

570
00:33:48,635 --> 00:33:50,803
And I don't know
how to break the stroller down.

571
00:33:50,887 --> 00:33:52,972
I don't know how to fold it up.

572
00:33:53,056 --> 00:33:56,684
Okay. Well, sorry,
but this is a group for new mothers.

573
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:59,938
You're lying, because
on that sign out there, it says "parents."

574
00:34:00,021 --> 00:34:02,190
I'm a parent,
and I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

575
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:04,692
I don't have nobody else
to talk to about this shit.

576
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:07,862
Speaking of shit, the girl's
got some stuff flyin' out of her ass.

577
00:34:07,946 --> 00:34:09,030
It's like a fire hose.

578
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:11,673
I don't know if it's normal or not,
but it's two different kinds.

579
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,259
She can either hit you with a streamer.

580
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:16,704
That's when it's all put together,
and it's... it's a little solid.

581
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:18,206
And it's... it's a direct hit.

582
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:19,749
Or she'll buckshot you.

583
00:34:19,832 --> 00:34:23,127
And that's... that's that spray.
It's... it's a quick... whop!

584
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:27,590
I need help. I need the crying to stop.

585
00:34:27,674 --> 00:34:29,926
How do I make the crying stop?

586
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:35,306
Okay, um, my oldest had colic
for the first couple of months.

587
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:38,810
- What's colic?
- It's when babies cry for hours on end

588
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:41,688
without any reason until you feel
like your eyes are about to pop out.

589
00:34:43,189 --> 00:34:44,524
I gave the baby colic.

590
00:34:44,607 --> 00:34:46,734
No, that's... that's not how colic works.

591
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:49,458
I'm not washing my hands,
and I'm touching the baby.

592
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:50,967
And that's how I gave the baby colic.

593
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:54,826
You don't give a baby colic.
It's more of a digestive thing.

594
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,412
That's a relief.

595
00:34:57,495 --> 00:35:00,123
Thing that worked for me
was white noise, surprisingly.

596
00:35:00,206 --> 00:35:01,249
White noise?

597
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:02,542
White noise.

598
00:35:27,483 --> 00:35:30,528
And then looking ahead,
I'm gonna turn it over to Matt.

599
00:35:30,611 --> 00:35:33,823
And he's gonna show you
how this all can work for your customers.

600
00:35:33,906 --> 00:35:35,533
All right, Matt, you're up.

601
00:35:39,954 --> 00:35:41,330
- Matt.
- Matt!

602
00:35:41,414 --> 00:35:42,707
I'm not sleep.

603
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,083
Sleep.

604
00:35:44,167 --> 00:35:46,586
Nah, this guy never sleeps.
He's deep in thought.

605
00:35:46,669 --> 00:35:49,589
Yeah, deep in-- That's exactly what it is.

606
00:35:49,672 --> 00:35:51,174
Very deep in thought.

607
00:35:51,257 --> 00:35:53,009
Thank you. Thank you, Howard.

608
00:35:53,092 --> 00:35:56,679
And the reason why
is because I'm so excited...

609
00:35:56,763 --> 00:35:58,403
- Yeah.
- ...uh, about this.

610
00:35:58,431 --> 00:36:00,933
With this upgrade, there's thousands,

611
00:36:01,017 --> 00:36:04,395
and I mean thousands
of preset visuals from flooring

612
00:36:04,479 --> 00:36:08,858
to, uh... to walls
to lighting that really offers--

613
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:11,359
You hear cryin'?

614
00:36:12,278 --> 00:36:14,614
Crying? I don't hear any crying.

615
00:36:14,697 --> 00:36:16,324
I have a deviated septum,

616
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:18,409
so my nose whistles sometimes.
Maybe that's it?

617
00:36:18,493 --> 00:36:22,580
No, that's... that's not what it is.
I'm sorry. Excuse me for a second, please.

618
00:36:22,663 --> 00:36:24,082
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey. Where...

619
00:36:24,165 --> 00:36:25,583
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

620
00:36:27,794 --> 00:36:30,296
Here we go. Here we go.

621
00:36:30,379 --> 00:36:32,590
- Huh? Huh?
- Okay. Vacuum, yeah.

622
00:36:32,673 --> 00:36:34,050
Come on. Shh.

623
00:36:34,133 --> 00:36:36,844
We're gonna vacuum.
We're gonna vacuum.

624
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:37,804
Hey, Maddy!

625
00:36:37,887 --> 00:36:39,680
- Hey, hey. Whoa.
- This vacuum sucks.

626
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,432
- What's going on?
- Come on, Maddy.

627
00:36:41,516 --> 00:36:43,518
What's going on now?
What are you doing?

628
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,686
- What's going on?
- He's doing the vacuum thing.

629
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,706
- Here, let me take her.
- The vacuum thing?

630
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,482
- Okay.
- She likes the vacuum noise.

631
00:36:49,565 --> 00:36:50,858
Hey! Hi.

632
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:52,235
Uh, Matt's got a baby.

633
00:36:52,318 --> 00:36:55,404
Hey, I apologize for storming out like that.

634
00:36:55,488 --> 00:36:56,864
But she goes on these crying jags,

635
00:36:56,948 --> 00:37:00,201
and it's impossible
to really get her to stop and calm down.

636
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:03,162
- Does she wanna try sucking on my pinkie?
- No.

637
00:37:03,246 --> 00:37:05,057
- I used to help with my kids.
- No. Howard, no.

638
00:37:05,081 --> 00:37:06,642
- They loved to suck on the pinkie.
- Not sanitary.

639
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:09,961
Maybe this will help, mate.
It's, um... it's a white noise app.

640
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,630
- It helps me sleep.
- Thank you.

641
00:37:12,713 --> 00:37:16,092
My baby always calmed down
with skin-to-skin contact.

642
00:37:16,717 --> 00:37:19,637
She's 25 now.

643
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,557
And I want you to notice
the easy map-tree interface as well.

644
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,101
Once again, it's about giving
our customers what they want,

645
00:37:25,184 --> 00:37:26,185
which is the simplicity.

646
00:37:26,269 --> 00:37:28,563
Right?
Isn't that what you want, huh?

647
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:30,064
- They want simplicity.
- Okay.

648
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:33,901
I got a problem now.
This is a place of business, right?

649
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:37,280
It's not a place of babies.
In here, I'm kinda...

650
00:37:37,363 --> 00:37:39,365
I'm the designated asshole.

651
00:37:39,448 --> 00:37:40,491
Who designated you?

652
00:37:41,617 --> 00:37:44,162
- I'm just asking. Was it from birth or...
- Hey.

653
00:37:44,245 --> 00:37:46,706
You don't think
there's an asshole above me?

654
00:37:46,789 --> 00:37:49,625
And above that asshole, another asshole.

655
00:37:49,709 --> 00:37:51,085
An asshole chain.

656
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:53,089
It's an asshole chain.
That's exactly what it is.

657
00:37:53,129 --> 00:37:55,131
So-- Yeah?

658
00:37:55,715 --> 00:37:59,010
Just wanted to say,
great presentation, Matt.

659
00:37:59,093 --> 00:38:02,096
Definitely memorable.
We'll be talking this week.

660
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,890
Thank you. Thank you for that.

661
00:38:03,973 --> 00:38:05,975
It means a lot
since I'm about to get fired.

662
00:38:06,058 --> 00:38:07,643
- Thank you for--
- No.

663
00:38:07,727 --> 00:38:09,767
We'll be in touch. Thank you, Fionna.

664
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,981
See ya.

665
00:38:12,481 --> 00:38:13,481
Go on. Finish.

666
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:16,402
Hey, you're not that lucky.
I'm not firing you.

667
00:38:16,485 --> 00:38:20,239
I just happen to be worried about you.
When's the last time you had a break?

668
00:38:20,323 --> 00:38:22,742
You know,
there's a new thing called babysitters.

669
00:38:22,825 --> 00:38:24,702
- Oh, hi, Maddy.
- Yeah.

670
00:38:24,785 --> 00:38:28,623
My name is Summer.
I'm going to pick you up now.

671
00:38:29,457 --> 00:38:32,084
Oh, she doesn't speak English yet.
She's just a baby.

672
00:38:32,168 --> 00:38:34,921
Oh, I believe you have
to treat the infant with respect.

673
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:38,174
Right, Maddy? We've got this.

674
00:38:48,184 --> 00:38:49,685
Yeah, yeah.

675
00:38:49,769 --> 00:38:50,769
That's it.

676
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:57,109
All daddies deserve some time off.
Have some fun.

677
00:38:57,193 --> 00:38:59,028
You got a babysitter.
Have a good time.

678
00:38:59,111 --> 00:39:01,530
You need this, bro.
You a single parent now.

679
00:39:01,614 --> 00:39:04,283
Which is crazy to me to say this.
"Matt is a dad."

680
00:39:04,367 --> 00:39:06,827
To say that out loud still sound--
"Matt is a dad."

681
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:08,621
That is crazy. So insane.

682
00:39:08,704 --> 00:39:10,539
- That's crazy. Hey.
- What are you doin'?

683
00:39:10,623 --> 00:39:12,124
Nothin'. I'm just listening to you.

684
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:14,543
Are you serious right now?

685
00:39:15,544 --> 00:39:17,505
- What?
- What do you mean? What was that?

686
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:20,049
You don't see the diversity
just walked past? Huh?

687
00:39:20,132 --> 00:39:22,051
- All the flavors. For all of us.
- Okay.

688
00:39:22,134 --> 00:39:24,095
I gotta get going, man. I'm going home.

689
00:39:25,137 --> 00:39:26,806
- Matt.
- Excuse me.

690
00:39:26,889 --> 00:39:28,849
- Excuse me.
- Matt! Matt! Matt! Hey, hey, Matt!

691
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,893
- What, man?
- What's up? Where you goin'?

692
00:39:30,977 --> 00:39:32,577
What do you mean, where I'm goin'?
Home!

693
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:34,915
- Why are you leavin'?
- Because I'm not havin' a good time.

694
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:37,566
What? We got girls back there.
We're taking shots, having a good--

695
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:41,612
I don't care about no girls, man. What
makes you think I care about girls now?

696
00:39:41,696 --> 00:39:43,406
Man, I brought you out
to have a good time.

697
00:39:43,489 --> 00:39:46,951
I don't want your version
of a good time, Jordan.

698
00:39:47,034 --> 00:39:48,034
I don't want it.

699
00:39:48,077 --> 00:39:50,138
Okay, look. I get it.
You haven't been out since Liz.

700
00:39:50,162 --> 00:39:51,872
- But it's--
- Shut the-- Hey, man.

701
00:39:53,416 --> 00:39:54,416
Don't.

702
00:39:55,835 --> 00:39:57,545
Don't do that. Don't bring Liz up.

703
00:39:58,754 --> 00:39:59,754
Don't do that.

704
00:40:03,676 --> 00:40:04,676
Idiot.

705
00:40:05,553 --> 00:40:07,346
- Say bye.
- Bye.

706
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,431
Goodbye.

707
00:40:09,181 --> 00:40:12,101
We're never gonna see her again, are we?

708
00:40:12,184 --> 00:40:15,354
All we need is us.
We don't need no one else.

709
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:37,543
Here come Javier.

710
00:40:37,626 --> 00:40:41,172
That's daddy's new best friend.
He brings us our formula, our diapers.

711
00:40:41,255 --> 00:40:44,759
He gives us everything we need
so we don't have to talk to people again.

712
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:47,762
If anybody else ring this bell,
they die. You hear me?

713
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:50,931
I say, if anybody
ring Daddy bell, they gonna die.

714
00:40:56,812 --> 00:40:58,064
I said, "No ringin'."

715
00:40:58,814 --> 00:41:01,067
I said, "No ringin' the damn bell."

716
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,569
I'm gonna kill somebody.

717
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:08,366
Good morning.

718
00:41:08,449 --> 00:41:09,325
- Hi.
- Hey.

719
00:41:09,408 --> 00:41:10,576
Where is my grandbaby?

720
00:41:10,659 --> 00:41:11,660
What are you--

721
00:41:11,744 --> 00:41:12,828
Is she dressed?

722
00:41:12,912 --> 00:41:16,207
- What are you doing here, Marion?
- Well, it's Maddy's pediatrician visit.

723
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:19,210
Oh, shit! Is it Thursday already?
Shit!

724
00:41:19,293 --> 00:41:23,506
Yeah, you didn't forget
the pediatrician's visit, did you?

725
00:41:23,589 --> 00:41:25,966
I didn't forget anything.
You just caught me.

726
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,219
We was about to leave.
She just got out of the tub.

727
00:41:28,302 --> 00:41:29,845
You left her in the tub?

728
00:41:29,929 --> 00:41:31,013
Good.

729
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,765
Yeah.

730
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,101
How's she been eating?

731
00:41:35,184 --> 00:41:36,519
Uh...

732
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:39,688
I mean, okay, I guess, you know?

733
00:41:39,772 --> 00:41:40,772
She, um...

734
00:41:42,191 --> 00:41:43,835
For the most part, I... I think it's fine.

735
00:41:43,859 --> 00:41:45,778
Every once in a while, if she's sleeping,

736
00:41:45,861 --> 00:41:48,239
I may let her go,
like, an extra hour or something.

737
00:41:48,322 --> 00:41:50,491
And how about you?
How are you doing?

738
00:41:51,325 --> 00:41:53,202
It's not... it's not really about me.

739
00:41:53,285 --> 00:41:55,996
- It's about--
- How is Maddy? Is she okay?

740
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:58,624
Look, I know I ain't perfect.

741
00:41:58,707 --> 00:42:01,794
I know that.
I'm... I'm actually nothin'.

742
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:05,923
- I'm a joke, okay? Lis--
- Matt, you're not a joke.

743
00:42:06,006 --> 00:42:07,133
Maddy is doing great.

744
00:42:07,216 --> 00:42:09,802
She's moved up
to the 60th percentile in weight

745
00:42:09,885 --> 00:42:11,512
and 70th in height.

746
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:13,764
You can start feeding her
when she's hungry.

747
00:42:14,557 --> 00:42:16,684
Look, I hope
you don't mind me saying this,

748
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:19,145
but your wife would be very proud of you.

749
00:42:36,245 --> 00:42:37,413
It's okay, Marion.

750
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:40,040
It's all right.

751
00:42:43,711 --> 00:42:45,111
You hungry?
You wanna go get lunch?

752
00:42:45,171 --> 00:42:49,175
Uh, no, no. Actually, um,
I gotta get back to the airport.

753
00:42:49,258 --> 00:42:51,135
- Already?
- Yeah, yeah.

754
00:42:52,011 --> 00:42:54,472
I told Mike
that I was spending the day at the spa.

755
00:42:55,055 --> 00:42:56,055
You told--

756
00:42:58,142 --> 00:42:59,822
Want me to take you?
I can give you a ride.

757
00:42:59,852 --> 00:43:01,812
No, she needs to get to her little nap.

758
00:43:01,896 --> 00:43:03,063
You want a little nap?

759
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:04,690
Oh God. Matthew,

760
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:08,944
today was a good day for you as a parent.

761
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:12,531
You keep all these little victories
like you had today

762
00:43:12,615 --> 00:43:14,783
in a little box inside you.

763
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:18,037
They'll be your most prized possessions.

764
00:43:18,913 --> 00:43:21,248
And don't let me
have to come back up here

765
00:43:21,749 --> 00:43:26,879
before Father Mayfield
is going to christen her in Minnesota.

766
00:43:26,962 --> 00:43:29,298
Saint Augustine's, three weeks.
I'll see you there.

767
00:43:29,381 --> 00:43:30,508
Wait, what do you--

768
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:32,092
Minnesota, three weeks. See you.

769
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:34,136
- Minnesota in three--
- Grammy loves you, Maddy.

770
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:37,181
Nobody... nobody said nothing
to me about Minnesota.

771
00:43:39,934 --> 00:43:43,103
Who finished up
their whole bottle? You did.

772
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:45,272
Yes, you did. You were hungry.

773
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:46,440
Huh?

774
00:43:46,524 --> 00:43:47,525
"I'm hungry, Daddy."

775
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,860
It's her first flight.

776
00:43:49,944 --> 00:43:52,238
I never would have guessed.

777
00:43:52,321 --> 00:43:53,948
- She's a cutie.
- Yeah...

778
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:57,785
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

779
00:43:57,868 --> 00:43:59,245
I'm so sorry.

780
00:43:59,328 --> 00:44:01,080
- Hey!
- Yeah!

781
00:44:02,081 --> 00:44:04,208
- Hey!
- Oh boy! Maddy!

782
00:44:05,459 --> 00:44:07,878
- What a bundle of joy!
- Hey!

783
00:44:07,962 --> 00:44:09,213
Hi, sweetheart!

784
00:44:09,296 --> 00:44:12,466
- Got it? Okay.
- Good? Good? Come on now.

785
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,724
Anna, come on,
let's get something cold to drink.

786
00:44:20,808 --> 00:44:21,809
Okay.

787
00:44:44,873 --> 00:44:48,085
Remember when I caught
you guys messin' around in here?

788
00:44:48,168 --> 00:44:49,587
Oh my goodness.

789
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:50,671
Yes, I do.

790
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:53,757
You chased me with Mike's hockey stick.

791
00:44:53,841 --> 00:44:58,345
You kept... you kept yellin' out,
"Not in this house. Not in this house!"

792
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:01,181
You thought
you were gonna get lucky that night.

793
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:03,267
You got damn lucky, didn't you?

794
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:06,186
It's amazing
what you can do when you're scared.

795
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:07,688
I've never been that fast.

796
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:09,148
The room looks different.

797
00:45:09,648 --> 00:45:14,528
Oh, I brought a lot of things
down from the attic, from her childhood.

798
00:45:15,195 --> 00:45:17,489
I like it.
I like it a lot.

799
00:45:18,866 --> 00:45:21,076
At first, I spent whole days in here.

800
00:45:22,494 --> 00:45:24,246
Whole days.

801
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:25,873
Just lyin' on the bed,

802
00:45:26,665 --> 00:45:28,584
smelling the pillows.

803
00:45:28,667 --> 00:45:31,253
Cryin'. Pissed.

804
00:45:31,337 --> 00:45:35,716
I'm down to one hour each day.
That's all I allow myself now.

805
00:45:37,718 --> 00:45:42,681
I'd like for you to let
Maddy come and stay with us sometimes.

806
00:45:43,515 --> 00:45:44,642
When she's bigger.

807
00:45:45,434 --> 00:45:47,144
She could spend summers here.

808
00:45:47,227 --> 00:45:48,103
Summers?

809
00:45:48,187 --> 00:45:50,898
Matt, she needs family.

810
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:55,277
She'll need a woman in her life.

811
00:45:57,488 --> 00:46:00,282
And I don't mean some woman
you met in the club.

812
00:46:00,949 --> 00:46:02,159
Or on Tinders.

813
00:46:02,242 --> 00:46:05,663
Tinders?

814
00:46:08,082 --> 00:46:10,292
I'm not on Tinder. And what are you--

815
00:46:10,376 --> 00:46:14,171
How do you know about Tinder?
Where are you gettin' this stuff?

816
00:46:18,717 --> 00:46:19,927
Hey, I'm...

817
00:46:22,971 --> 00:46:25,683
You think maybe
you can watch Maddy for me tonight?

818
00:46:25,766 --> 00:46:27,559
Yeah! Yes!

819
00:46:27,643 --> 00:46:31,105
So I can go meet up with some friends,
go have a drink.

820
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:33,941
- Yeah, you do that. Yeah!
- All right. Okay.

821
00:46:56,672 --> 00:46:57,673
Thank you.

822
00:47:01,176 --> 00:47:02,176
Mom?

823
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,596
Did Dad like having a baby?

824
00:47:05,597 --> 00:47:07,015
Oh, he loved babies.

825
00:47:07,099 --> 00:47:10,018
That's why he had so many of them
with so many different women.

826
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:13,147
Yeah, but he married you.

827
00:47:13,814 --> 00:47:15,023
Yes, lucky me.

828
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:17,985
I was lucky 'cause I had you.

829
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:23,115
I'm just hopin' I can be
half as good a mom as you were with me.

830
00:47:25,367 --> 00:47:26,452
You're a good mom.

831
00:47:28,704 --> 00:47:31,039
Maddy, guess what?

832
00:47:31,665 --> 00:47:32,665
See the baby?

833
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,379
Isn't she beautiful? Sister...

834
00:47:37,463 --> 00:47:38,547
She did so good, huh?

835
00:47:48,056 --> 00:47:51,018
Come in.

836
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,759
Wake up, Daddy! It's a school day!

837
00:48:23,842 --> 00:48:25,052
- Wake up!
- I'm up.

838
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:26,512
You gotta treat it like a...

839
00:48:27,387 --> 00:48:29,932
like you're sneaking up on it and grab it.

840
00:48:30,015 --> 00:48:34,645
Over, under, over.

841
00:48:35,938 --> 00:48:36,938
Okay.

842
00:48:37,856 --> 00:48:39,900
Okay, that's one. Just let me--

843
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:42,986
What is this?

844
00:48:44,905 --> 00:48:48,200
I think it's a new... a new... a new look.

845
00:48:48,283 --> 00:48:51,578
I think it's a new hairstyle
that can catch on if given a chance.

846
00:48:52,371 --> 00:48:53,372
Just stay still.

847
00:48:53,872 --> 00:48:55,499
We gotta go top. Let me--

848
00:48:57,501 --> 00:48:59,837
Hold on, okay?

849
00:49:09,471 --> 00:49:11,640
All the girls are wearing skirts,

850
00:49:11,723 --> 00:49:15,227
but skirts make me feel
like I forgot my pants.

851
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:17,271
But she said it's a rule.

852
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:20,691
Rules?
We don't need no stinkin' rules.

853
00:49:22,609 --> 00:49:26,405
- Maddy, do you like goin' to school here?
- Mommy wanted me to be here. I like it.

854
00:49:27,489 --> 00:49:29,199
That's all I needed to hear then.

855
00:49:29,283 --> 00:49:31,285
All right, go ahead. I love you.

856
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:32,369
Love you too.

857
00:49:32,452 --> 00:49:34,955
Two kisses.
Forehead, forehead. I got you.

858
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:36,123
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye.

859
00:49:39,626 --> 00:49:41,712
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

860
00:49:41,795 --> 00:49:44,423
Mr. Logelin,
we need to discuss the dress code.

861
00:49:44,506 --> 00:49:46,091
Hey, you have a good day, okay?

862
00:49:46,174 --> 00:49:47,926
There's a dress code here!

863
00:49:52,014 --> 00:49:54,600
Maddy, it's on you.
You wanna check or bet?

864
00:49:54,683 --> 00:49:55,726
All in.

865
00:49:55,809 --> 00:49:57,644
All in again?

866
00:49:57,728 --> 00:49:58,728
- Wow!
- All in again?

867
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:01,857
- I'm gonna go ahead and fold, chief.
- You gonna fold like a chump.

868
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:05,027
- She looks serious.
- I don't know if she's bluffin' or not.

869
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:07,154
- Seriously.
- Let me see your face.

870
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:11,199
That's a poker face right there.
That's a poker face.

871
00:50:11,283 --> 00:50:12,843
How can you break that down?
You can't.

872
00:50:12,868 --> 00:50:14,748
I don't know what you got
going on in that head.

873
00:50:14,786 --> 00:50:19,207
I can see into the mind of Maddy.
Hold on.

874
00:50:24,212 --> 00:50:26,506
I got nothin', guys. I'm out. I fold.

875
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:29,384
I'm goin' all in. You kiddin' me?

876
00:50:29,468 --> 00:50:31,553
Look at this. Bam. Queens.

877
00:50:31,637 --> 00:50:33,138
- What do you have?
- What do you got?

878
00:50:34,348 --> 00:50:36,725
- Aces.
- What? What?

879
00:50:36,808 --> 00:50:38,769
- No!
- Pocket rockets.

880
00:50:38,852 --> 00:50:40,572
- Pocket aces.
- Okay. That was a good hand.

881
00:50:40,646 --> 00:50:43,065
- She got pocket rockets!
- It's all yours. Take it.

882
00:50:43,148 --> 00:50:45,776
- Scoop it. It's yours.
- What? Okay, that's all you.

883
00:50:45,859 --> 00:50:47,545
- This is all mine.
- Okay. Go ahead.

884
00:50:47,569 --> 00:50:49,321
You're not gonna eat all that today either.

885
00:50:49,404 --> 00:50:50,405
Ship it!

886
00:50:50,489 --> 00:50:52,032
There you go.

887
00:50:56,495 --> 00:50:59,122
Did you... did you eat your veggies?
What is that, cake?

888
00:51:06,213 --> 00:51:08,465
Oh yeah!

889
00:51:08,548 --> 00:51:11,635
They're having so much fun.
Makes you wish you had a kid to bring.

890
00:51:11,718 --> 00:51:14,513
Oh, I do. Crazy one's mine. That's Maddy.

891
00:51:14,596 --> 00:51:16,807
Hi, Daddy!

892
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:20,268
- Hey!
- Cannonball!

893
00:51:21,228 --> 00:51:22,312
Are you Matt?

894
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:24,146
I am Matt.

895
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,569
I think I know why
Oscar and Rose insisted I come today.

896
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:31,863
- I think we're being set up.
- Oh, wow.

897
00:51:31,947 --> 00:51:34,950
I told 'em to stop trying.

898
00:51:35,033 --> 00:51:37,577
- Funny thing is I said the same thing.
- Yeah?

899
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:40,640
We should mess with 'em. Throw your drink
in my face, make it look real bad.

900
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:43,542
Or we could break up with them as friends.

901
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:46,294
You know what?
I've been looking for new white people.

902
00:51:47,295 --> 00:51:49,381
I have. I really have.

903
00:51:49,464 --> 00:51:51,967
There's plenty here. So...

904
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:53,051
What do you do?

905
00:51:53,135 --> 00:51:54,177
Uh, I'm an animator.

906
00:51:54,261 --> 00:51:56,805
An animator?
That's cool. That's different.

907
00:51:56,888 --> 00:51:59,683
I, uh... I work with this guy.

908
00:51:59,766 --> 00:52:00,766
I work with Oscar.

909
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:03,395
- Hey.
- That's my name.

910
00:52:03,478 --> 00:52:06,189
Don't wear it out. Just kidding.
You can say it as much as you want.

911
00:52:07,149 --> 00:52:11,153
So, you two meeting at, uh,
Oliver's birthday party.

912
00:52:11,236 --> 00:52:12,236
Yeah.

913
00:52:12,738 --> 00:52:14,138
- Pretty great.
- What are the odds?

914
00:52:14,197 --> 00:52:15,615
What are the odds, you know?

915
00:52:16,116 --> 00:52:18,744
I mean, you know,
you're great, and you're great and...

916
00:52:19,244 --> 00:52:20,370
It's just, uh...

917
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:23,957
- It's not a setup though. You know?
- Got it. Got it.

918
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:25,792
- Very smooth, by the way, Oscar.
- Yeah.

919
00:52:26,835 --> 00:52:27,711
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

920
00:52:27,794 --> 00:52:28,794
Great.

921
00:52:30,005 --> 00:52:31,131
Thank you.

922
00:52:31,214 --> 00:52:32,132
Hi, Rose.

923
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:33,215
Hi, Rose.

924
00:52:33,592 --> 00:52:34,592
Unreal.

925
00:52:35,093 --> 00:52:36,845
My name's Liz.

926
00:52:37,929 --> 00:52:38,972
Stop playin'.

927
00:52:39,598 --> 00:52:44,227
Um, I'm not playing. My name is--
Well, Lizzie is what my friends call me.

928
00:52:48,482 --> 00:52:49,483
You're an animator.

929
00:52:50,275 --> 00:52:53,403
- What have you animated?
- I work on a show called Lucky Jim.

930
00:52:53,487 --> 00:52:56,823
Lucky Jim. I know what that is.
Maddy loves that show.

931
00:52:57,991 --> 00:52:59,659
You let her watch Lucky Jim?

932
00:53:00,702 --> 00:53:01,787
Yeah, it's a cartoon.

933
00:53:02,662 --> 00:53:03,914
Have you ever watched it?

934
00:53:04,456 --> 00:53:06,374
It's called Lucky Jim
because he gets lucky.

935
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:09,961
- You talkin' about sex?
- Uh-huh.

936
00:53:11,505 --> 00:53:14,800
- I thought he was, like, a leprechaun.
- Yeah, he's a leprechaun.

937
00:53:14,883 --> 00:53:19,221
A really lucky, really horny leprechaun.

938
00:53:21,056 --> 00:53:23,600
Is there, like, a warning on it
that kids shouldn't watch it?

939
00:53:23,683 --> 00:53:25,393
There's definitely a warning.

940
00:53:29,397 --> 00:53:31,459
You know where the pot of gold is?

941
00:53:31,483 --> 00:53:33,961
Begorra,
the pot of gold is right over there.

942
00:53:33,985 --> 00:53:36,113
And now that rainbow's up and disappeared.

943
00:53:36,196 --> 00:53:38,073
I think you're full of horse blarney.

944
00:53:38,156 --> 00:53:41,036
I'd like to show you what I'm full of,
me lassie, if you've no objection.

945
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:46,289
I've no objection
to plucking the clover out of you.

946
00:53:46,373 --> 00:53:47,415
I'm seeing stars.

947
00:53:47,499 --> 00:53:49,918
You'll be seeing more than stars in a moment.

948
00:53:50,418 --> 00:53:51,418
That's it.

949
00:53:52,879 --> 00:53:54,999
- Oh, that's off.
- Daddy, they were about to wrestle.

950
00:53:55,048 --> 00:53:57,551
I know that.
I know that. And that's a little...

951
00:53:57,634 --> 00:53:59,845
It's a little too violent
for you to watch, honey.

952
00:54:00,345 --> 00:54:02,013
- Wait, did you call her?
- Zip it.

953
00:54:02,097 --> 00:54:04,891
- What do you mean, "Zip it"?
- Zip it. Don't be a bonehead.

954
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:06,953
- Why I gotta be a bonehead?
- Don't be a bonehead.

955
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:09,377
- Maddy can handle it, right?
- Stop. What'd I ask you to do?

956
00:54:09,437 --> 00:54:10,480
Handle what?

957
00:54:10,564 --> 00:54:12,274
- Jordan, what'd I say?
- Look, I got this.

958
00:54:12,357 --> 00:54:13,584
- Jordan, I don't--
- I got this.

959
00:54:13,608 --> 00:54:15,569
- Jordan--
- That's what friends are for.

960
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:17,821
Sometimes two adults
meet each other, right?

961
00:54:17,904 --> 00:54:19,531
And they fall in love.

962
00:54:19,614 --> 00:54:21,575
And then they both are nearsighted.

963
00:54:22,242 --> 00:54:25,203
Have that in common
and all these beautiful things.

964
00:54:25,287 --> 00:54:27,455
They take long walks in the park together.

965
00:54:27,539 --> 00:54:29,541
You know, you find that special someone.

966
00:54:30,417 --> 00:54:34,504
But then they get real petty one day
and kick you in your back

967
00:54:35,088 --> 00:54:36,756
'cause you snoring while you sleep.

968
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,466
- What?
- You're sleeping on the floor.

969
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:39,759
- You're all messed up.
- What?

970
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:42,523
- Carpet burns on your arm.
- That's-- What are you-- That's enough!

971
00:54:42,596 --> 00:54:44,115
- It's not enough, okay?
- It is enough.

972
00:54:44,139 --> 00:54:46,516
You don't know
if you're gonna find a special someone.

973
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,602
You're not talking about nobody
but yourself--

974
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:50,365
You know he's talking
about himself, right?

975
00:54:50,395 --> 00:54:54,774
I know. But if they liked each other,
and then they didn't like each other,

976
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:58,778
couldn't they like each other again?
And wouldn't that be fun?

977
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:01,865
- Yeah, Maddy.
- Wow.

978
00:55:02,449 --> 00:55:04,951
Give me a high five
or something, a hug. Come here.

979
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:07,037
- I mean...
- You are brilliant. You a genius.

980
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,289
Gotta be to make sense
of all that stuff you just said.

981
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:12,375
Don't be a hater.
I wanna-- Look, you are so smart.

982
00:55:12,459 --> 00:55:14,294
You definitely don't get that
from your daddy.

983
00:55:16,463 --> 00:55:18,048
How come you wear boys' pants?

984
00:55:18,131 --> 00:55:20,091
Okay, stay together. No running.

985
00:55:20,175 --> 00:55:22,177
Hey, Maddy, are you a boy?

986
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,345
Are you a girl?

987
00:55:23,428 --> 00:55:24,596
Zip it, bonehead!

988
00:55:24,679 --> 00:55:25,680
Madeline!

989
00:55:27,307 --> 00:55:30,310
I really don't understand this.
The kid was teasin' her.

990
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:32,270
Maybe you should talk
to that kid's parents.

991
00:55:32,354 --> 00:55:33,188
I have.

992
00:55:33,271 --> 00:55:37,150
But he was teasing her because
she was the only girl wearing pants.

993
00:55:37,859 --> 00:55:41,238
What if a boy wanted to come
to school dressed in a skirt?

994
00:55:42,322 --> 00:55:45,075
Then that's that boy's business.
It's the 21st century.

995
00:55:45,158 --> 00:55:49,746
Mr. Logelin, Madeline is in kindergarten.
She doesn't have a mother to model after.

996
00:55:49,829 --> 00:55:54,251
I am well aware
of what my daughter doesn't have.

997
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:59,631
You have to at least show her
that wearing girls' clothing is an option.

998
00:56:00,465 --> 00:56:03,426
I just don't... I just don't understand
why nuns are so tough.

999
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:08,223
Why are you guys so tough? Like, what...
what is it that happens in nun camp

1000
00:56:08,306 --> 00:56:10,016
that makes you guys this strict?

1001
00:56:12,394 --> 00:56:15,814
I'm not gonna say anything else because
I don't wanna get struck by lightning.

1002
00:56:15,897 --> 00:56:18,608
Okay, here you go, Maddy.
What about these here?

1003
00:56:19,484 --> 00:56:21,903
No. I want these.

1004
00:56:22,529 --> 00:56:24,072
- You want those?
- Yeah.

1005
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:26,448
Um...

1006
00:56:27,575 --> 00:56:29,577
Okay, if that's what you want.

1007
00:56:30,745 --> 00:56:31,746
Are you going out?

1008
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:36,584
Yes. Rose is coming over,
and Daddy's gonna go out.

1009
00:56:37,294 --> 00:56:39,212
With Oscar?

1010
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:41,006
No, not with Oscar.

1011
00:56:41,756 --> 00:56:43,341
With Jordan?

1012
00:56:43,425 --> 00:56:44,884
No, not with Jordan.

1013
00:56:45,552 --> 00:56:46,552
A lady?

1014
00:56:47,762 --> 00:56:48,930
Yes, it's a lady.

1015
00:56:49,723 --> 00:56:50,807
Does that bother you?

1016
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:53,059
- Does it bother you?
- I asked first.

1017
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:55,937
Is it Sister Kathleen from school?

1018
00:56:56,021 --> 00:56:59,065
No, it is not Sister Kathleen from school.

1019
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:00,859
Then that's okay. Who is it?

1020
00:57:00,942 --> 00:57:02,736
It's a lady friend
from the birthday party.

1021
00:57:07,866 --> 00:57:08,867
You know what?

1022
00:57:09,534 --> 00:57:11,077
I got a surprise for you.

1023
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:15,332
See, I was gonna wait till you got older.
This was Mommy's jewelry box.

1024
00:57:15,415 --> 00:57:19,377
I want you to pick something out
of here that can be just for you.

1025
00:57:19,461 --> 00:57:22,172
- Anything?
- Anything you want.

1026
00:57:23,631 --> 00:57:24,631
Hmm.

1027
00:57:25,717 --> 00:57:26,717
This one.

1028
00:57:30,221 --> 00:57:31,221
Wow.

1029
00:57:32,307 --> 00:57:33,350
I like this one.

1030
00:57:41,232 --> 00:57:42,734
Such a good choice.

1031
00:57:45,236 --> 00:57:46,780
Such a good choice.

1032
00:57:49,449 --> 00:57:50,784
Hmm, let me put it on you.

1033
00:57:56,414 --> 00:57:58,083
Is she in this? Mommy?

1034
00:57:59,501 --> 00:58:04,005
Yeah, she's in there.
She's in you. She's in me. She's in...

1035
00:58:06,174 --> 00:58:07,675
She's in whoever she touched.

1036
00:58:09,511 --> 00:58:10,511
So...

1037
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:11,930
And what did she say to that?

1038
00:58:12,013 --> 00:58:15,433
Oh, she said
that her mom is in her because of DNA.

1039
00:58:16,142 --> 00:58:18,478
- What?
- Yeah, that's-- I swear to God.

1040
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:20,105
What? Is she some kind of genius?

1041
00:58:20,188 --> 00:58:22,732
You know what it is?
Maddy just asks a lot of questions.

1042
00:58:22,816 --> 00:58:25,068
- Mmm.
- I took her to this mummy show.

1043
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:30,031
They were talking about DNA at the show,
so I tried to explain to her what DNA was.

1044
00:58:30,115 --> 00:58:32,075
And in doing that, she just...

1045
00:58:32,826 --> 00:58:33,827
What?

1046
00:58:34,869 --> 00:58:37,997
Um, I guess
I'm kind of surprised you're still single.

1047
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:40,250
All those hot single moms
at the kiddie park.

1048
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:41,709
Stop it. Stop.

1049
00:58:41,793 --> 00:58:44,504
There's nothing hot about single parents.

1050
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:48,716
We are overworked,
sleep-deprived, covered in baby vomit.

1051
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,093
- That's hot.
- That's hot?

1052
00:58:50,176 --> 00:58:52,137
- It's hot.
- All that is hot?

1053
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:55,181
- You're funny. You're very funny.
- You've just been through a lot.

1054
00:58:56,266 --> 00:58:57,183
You and Maddy.

1055
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:58,685
We have been through a lot.

1056
00:58:59,561 --> 00:59:01,729
But we're okay, you know?
We, uh...

1057
00:59:04,566 --> 00:59:07,444
We're on our own, and we're... we're fine.

1058
00:59:07,527 --> 00:59:09,070
I get that, you know?

1059
00:59:09,654 --> 00:59:12,615
I'm on my own, and I'm fine too.
I like where I'm at.

1060
00:59:12,699 --> 00:59:14,284
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

1061
00:59:14,868 --> 00:59:18,538
So, you, um... you must have had
a good example of how to be a dad?

1062
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:20,957
No. No, I did not.

1063
00:59:21,541 --> 00:59:23,793
Actually, I had
the complete opposite of that.

1064
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:26,629
I know what not to do because of my dad.

1065
00:59:30,717 --> 00:59:32,177
I'm gonna kiss you now, okay?

1066
00:59:33,678 --> 00:59:34,678
Okay.

1067
00:59:35,597 --> 00:59:36,681
I think I'm prepared.

1068
00:59:38,057 --> 00:59:41,019
Oh, do you prefer
my false teeth in or out?

1069
00:59:41,102 --> 00:59:45,231
Leave 'em in, just in case I mess up,
so I got something to blame it on.

1070
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:46,316
Sure.

1071
00:59:57,076 --> 01:00:01,247
Does it... bother you
that my name is Lizzie?

1072
01:00:03,541 --> 01:00:04,541
No.

1073
01:00:05,418 --> 01:00:07,295
But you can change it if you want to.

1074
01:00:08,046 --> 01:00:11,257
Okay. You know,
if you wanna call me anything like,

1075
01:00:11,966 --> 01:00:13,635
"Your Highness,"

1076
01:00:13,718 --> 01:00:16,429
or like, my mom was gonna name me Majesty.

1077
01:00:16,513 --> 01:00:18,848
Anything along those lines is great.

1078
01:00:18,932 --> 01:00:20,767
Okay. Noted.

1079
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:22,310
- Mm-hmm.
- What about Hank?

1080
01:00:24,812 --> 01:00:27,315
What about Hank?

1081
01:00:27,398 --> 01:00:28,233
Why?

1082
01:00:28,316 --> 01:00:30,401
- You said anything I want.
- Okay.

1083
01:00:30,485 --> 01:00:32,403
- Okay?
- Okay, we'll... we'll test it out.

1084
01:00:32,487 --> 01:00:35,615
- Okay. Let's test it out right now.
- Is that a deal? Okay. We'll test it out.

1085
01:00:35,698 --> 01:00:38,159
Go. Go get in the...
go get in the house safe, Hank.

1086
01:00:38,243 --> 01:00:40,537
Oh my God.

1087
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:43,057
- Thanks for the good time, Hank.
- Hank!

1088
01:00:43,081 --> 01:00:44,808
- Hank!
- Good night!

1089
01:00:44,832 --> 01:00:48,086
No, all right, stop it.
That's enough. Thank you.

1090
01:00:48,586 --> 01:00:49,587
Good night.

1091
01:00:57,762 --> 01:01:01,224
Wow. Wow, wow, wow.

1092
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:02,891
Mmm.

1093
01:01:03,977 --> 01:01:05,186
Hey.

1094
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:06,187
You're late.

1095
01:01:06,271 --> 01:01:07,480
What do you mean, I'm late?

1096
01:01:07,564 --> 01:01:09,816
You told Rose you'd be home at 11.

1097
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:13,987
Well, guess what?
It is 11:13 right now.

1098
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:15,530
Yeah. Late.

1099
01:01:15,613 --> 01:01:18,449
All right.
That is not that late. Hey, Rose.

1100
01:01:18,533 --> 01:01:20,201
Hey.
I swear I put her to bed.

1101
01:01:20,285 --> 01:01:21,160
- Did you?
- Uh-huh.

1102
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:23,764
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna ground me because I'm late?

1103
01:01:23,788 --> 01:01:25,248
Huh? Is that what you wanna do?

1104
01:01:25,331 --> 01:01:28,251
Do you wanna ground
your dad because he's late, huh?

1105
01:01:28,334 --> 01:01:29,877
- Yes, yes.
- There you go.

1106
01:01:29,961 --> 01:01:31,212
- Good.
- Are your shoes tied?

1107
01:01:31,296 --> 01:01:32,856
- I don't think his shoes are tied.
- Hey.

1108
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,257
- Hey, Maddy.
- Where's Daddy?

1109
01:01:35,133 --> 01:01:36,133
Oh, um...

1110
01:01:36,884 --> 01:01:39,846
Yeah, so, your dad had to work late,

1111
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:42,557
but, uh, we wanted to come watch you play

1112
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:45,435
and then maybe get
some ice cream afterwards.

1113
01:01:45,518 --> 01:01:48,354
'Cause he's not doin'
anything fun with anyone,

1114
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:50,690
and I am telling you the truth.

1115
01:02:07,373 --> 01:02:09,125
I'm gonna walk you through
how our software

1116
01:02:09,208 --> 01:02:11,711
can help you redesign
every aspect of your new mall.

1117
01:02:11,794 --> 01:02:13,194
What you gotta see-- What are you--

1118
01:02:13,254 --> 01:02:15,014
What's goin' on? Stop it.

1119
01:02:15,882 --> 01:02:18,602
Sorry, it's Bring Your Kid to Work Day,
so you can only imagine the--

1120
01:02:18,635 --> 01:02:20,178
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

1121
01:02:20,261 --> 01:02:23,848
- Let's go out.
- No. Wait a second. Stop it, Maddy. Stop.

1122
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:26,501
We are... we are...

1123
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:28,479
- I've got your keys.
- Put my keys down.

1124
01:02:28,561 --> 01:02:30,281
I'm gonna throw them out the window.

1125
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:31,481
Wait, put my key--

1126
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:34,734
Give me the keys. Stop.
What are you doing? What is--

1127
01:02:34,817 --> 01:02:37,779
- What's your favorite movie?
- His Girl Friday.

1128
01:02:38,279 --> 01:02:39,864
Okay. That's a great movie.

1129
01:02:39,947 --> 01:02:40,947
Um...

1130
01:02:41,366 --> 01:02:42,659
Bringing Up Baby.

1131
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:47,997
Let me think more recent.
Let me think, like, not before the 1940s.

1132
01:02:48,081 --> 01:02:49,081
Ask me mine.

1133
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:52,835
- What's your favorite movie?
- I'm Gonna Git You Sucka.

1134
01:02:57,215 --> 01:03:01,177
Dad! Dad! Dad!

1135
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:03,596
What is that?

1136
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,920
I'm serious. I thought
there was something on the window.

1137
01:03:05,973 --> 01:03:08,101
No, I don't fall for your tricks no more.

1138
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:11,604
What? I thought something was
on the window. I'm not gonna trick you.

1139
01:03:16,234 --> 01:03:17,944
Oh my gosh.
There's a booger on your shirt.

1140
01:03:18,027 --> 01:03:20,446
Take it off now! Take it off now!

1141
01:03:21,572 --> 01:03:23,700
Take it off now!

1142
01:03:24,492 --> 01:03:27,328
Um, before we eat,
I gotta tell you somethin'.

1143
01:03:27,954 --> 01:03:29,872
- I gotta tell you somethin' important.
- Okay.

1144
01:03:29,956 --> 01:03:31,999
So, Saturday night I gotta go out,

1145
01:03:32,083 --> 01:03:34,877
but Jennifer's mom said
you can stay the night.

1146
01:03:36,254 --> 01:03:38,047
Why can't I come with you?

1147
01:03:38,131 --> 01:03:41,259
One reason why you can't come with me
is I gotta do a bunch of grown-up stuff.

1148
01:03:42,176 --> 01:03:43,302
- All right?
- Mmm. Yeah.

1149
01:03:43,386 --> 01:03:44,386
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1150
01:03:44,429 --> 01:03:46,681
Okay, baby,
it's time to go to bed.

1151
01:03:46,764 --> 01:03:48,266
Are you gonna sleep in those?

1152
01:03:49,267 --> 01:03:51,978
You should take them off.
Flip, flip.

1153
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:53,938
Okay, hop in.

1154
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:02,196
Aw, okay. Good night, baby.

1155
01:04:04,657 --> 01:04:06,868
Good night, sweetie. Mommy loves you.

1156
01:04:10,955 --> 01:04:12,165
Good night, Maddy.

1157
01:04:18,838 --> 01:04:20,631
You wanna go back to my place?

1158
01:04:21,674 --> 01:04:25,303
- For what? You wanna play some poker?
- I don't know how to play poker.

1159
01:04:25,803 --> 01:04:28,431
But I was thinking something
even more fun than that.

1160
01:04:29,182 --> 01:04:30,182
Wow.

1161
01:04:31,309 --> 01:04:32,435
Is it Twister?

1162
01:04:33,019 --> 01:04:34,312
It's a form of Twister.

1163
01:04:34,395 --> 01:04:37,356
Okay, okay.

1164
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,234
All right, so now that I have
this information, I wanna be honest.

1165
01:04:40,318 --> 01:04:41,318
Okay.

1166
01:04:42,987 --> 01:04:44,947
I just wanna make sure that I'm...

1167
01:04:46,699 --> 01:04:48,451
- That I'm keeping Maddy--
- First.

1168
01:04:48,534 --> 01:04:50,912
- Yes. Like, she has to be...
- I know.

1169
01:04:50,995 --> 01:04:52,205
...a priority, you know?

1170
01:04:53,372 --> 01:04:54,957
- I understand.
- That's...

1171
01:04:55,041 --> 01:04:56,375
I really do. I get it.

1172
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:57,502
Okay.

1173
01:04:58,294 --> 01:05:00,171
That's part of what I like about you.

1174
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:02,464
Well,

1175
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:05,510
then maybe I should teach you

1176
01:05:06,385 --> 01:05:07,428
how to play poker.

1177
01:05:14,894 --> 01:05:18,022
Wow! This is amazing!

1178
01:05:18,105 --> 01:05:21,567
I know, right?
It's gonna be so much fun.

1179
01:05:34,413 --> 01:05:35,915
Hey, y'all gotta stop it!

1180
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:37,500
That's enough.

1181
01:05:37,583 --> 01:05:39,460
Hey, slow it do--

1182
01:05:41,921 --> 01:05:43,714
It's way too loud in here!

1183
01:05:45,758 --> 01:05:48,261
- You okay, Maddy?
- Yes.

1184
01:05:48,344 --> 01:05:49,804
Yeah?

1185
01:05:49,887 --> 01:05:50,972
Yeah?

1186
01:05:51,055 --> 01:05:54,141
- Hey, this is cool.
- Hey! Y'all gotta turn this--

1187
01:05:54,809 --> 01:05:55,977
It's too loud!

1188
01:05:57,186 --> 01:05:58,229
Come on, stay close.

1189
01:06:00,439 --> 01:06:02,984
Dad! You hit the clown!

1190
01:06:03,067 --> 01:06:04,360
Oh my God!

1191
01:06:04,944 --> 01:06:06,571
He... he okay, Maddy.

1192
01:06:07,238 --> 01:06:08,447
Yeah, yeah.

1193
01:06:08,531 --> 01:06:10,050
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1194
01:06:10,074 --> 01:06:12,285
Come on, give me your hand.
Give me your hand, honey.

1195
01:06:12,785 --> 01:06:14,453
What an amazing day, huh?

1196
01:06:14,537 --> 01:06:16,497
- Mm-hmm.
- It's, like, the best day ever.

1197
01:06:16,581 --> 01:06:18,958
I feel like nothing can mess up
a day like this.

1198
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:21,043
- It was so perfect.
- Yeah, it was very fun.

1199
01:06:21,127 --> 01:06:25,214
Yeah. I wanted, um... I wanted
to talk to you. Can I talk to you?

1200
01:06:25,298 --> 01:06:28,634
- Yeah.
- So... I, um...

1201
01:06:29,552 --> 01:06:34,098
I wanna introduce you
to somebody that I've been seeing.

1202
01:06:34,181 --> 01:06:36,976
It's like a... it's like a friend I got--

1203
01:06:37,059 --> 01:06:41,939
Well, I've been dating.
I've... I've been dating a friend, right?

1204
01:06:42,857 --> 01:06:45,484
That I've... that I've been...
that I've been seeing,

1205
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:49,739
but I... I think
that you would... you would like her.

1206
01:06:49,822 --> 01:06:50,907
- Daddy?
- Yeah.

1207
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:52,825
Can I have a lollipop?

1208
01:06:52,909 --> 01:06:56,037
Absolutely. Yeah,
let's... let's get you some more stuff.

1209
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:57,622
Some more candy, okay?

1210
01:06:57,705 --> 01:07:00,333
Maybe take one home,
and we finish this talk?

1211
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:02,543
Okay, but I don't wanna meet anyone.

1212
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:12,066
Hey, come... come here. Come here, Maddy.

1213
01:07:12,094 --> 01:07:13,989
- Come here, come here, come here.
- What?

1214
01:07:14,013 --> 01:07:15,097
- Hey.
- Hey.

1215
01:07:15,681 --> 01:07:17,117
- How are you?
- Good.

1216
01:07:17,141 --> 01:07:20,353
Good. Uh, Maddy, this is... this is Lizzie.

1217
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:23,314
Hey! Well, you can call me "Swan"

1218
01:07:23,814 --> 01:07:27,234
or "Dude" or "Butthead"!

1219
01:07:28,361 --> 01:07:30,821
Hey, so you guys wanna go
to the Tea Party thingy?

1220
01:07:30,905 --> 01:07:32,365
- You wanna do that?
- Mmm.

1221
01:07:32,865 --> 01:07:34,367
- Mmm.
- No?

1222
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:37,703
After 15 minutes, I heard they throw
the tea in the water, which could be cool.

1223
01:07:37,787 --> 01:07:39,997
- Mmm.
- Yeah. I'm super ambivalent too.

1224
01:07:40,081 --> 01:07:40,915
Mmm.

1225
01:07:40,998 --> 01:07:44,961
I do hear there's a cool spiders exhibit
in this kids' museum.

1226
01:07:45,044 --> 01:07:45,878
Wanna do that?

1227
01:07:45,962 --> 01:07:49,256
- I like tarantulas, but we already went.
- Yeah.

1228
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:51,467
Okay, how about we wing it?

1229
01:07:51,550 --> 01:07:52,468
- Yeah?
- Okay.

1230
01:07:52,551 --> 01:07:54,321
- Let's wing it, Swan.
- Let's wing it!

1231
01:07:54,345 --> 01:07:56,305
This is nice. You guys are--

1232
01:07:56,389 --> 01:07:59,183
- Right? This is cool. Maybe it's too soon.
- Look at that over there!

1233
01:08:09,819 --> 01:08:10,819
Ah.

1234
01:08:11,737 --> 01:08:12,947
Hold on. Ah.

1235
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:15,825
- Yes!
- Whoa! Whoa!

1236
01:08:15,908 --> 01:08:18,244
When the boat comes,
hit 'em with a wave.

1237
01:08:18,327 --> 01:08:20,579
You ready?
Hit 'em with a wave. There you go.

1238
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:23,249
See that? See how cool that is?

1239
01:08:23,332 --> 01:08:24,166
Yeah.

1240
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:27,378
I used to play
with these ducks when I was little!

1241
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:29,797
Hi, Billy.

1242
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:30,798
Hi, Bella.

1243
01:08:30,881 --> 01:08:32,567
- That was your favorite...
- Hi, Lily!

1244
01:08:32,591 --> 01:08:33,735
...and that was your favorite.

1245
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:35,519
- Duck, duck, duck, duck...
- Oh my goodness.

1246
01:08:35,594 --> 01:08:37,513
- ...duck, duck, duck, duck...
- Oh, my-- Ow.

1247
01:08:37,596 --> 01:08:38,931
...duck, duck, duck, goose!

1248
01:08:39,015 --> 01:08:41,017
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

1249
01:08:43,769 --> 01:08:44,812
Let me do a solo.

1250
01:08:48,524 --> 01:08:50,359
Solo, yes!

1251
01:08:53,112 --> 01:08:54,697
You wanna draw the castle?

1252
01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:56,258
- Yeah.
- What color?

1253
01:08:56,282 --> 01:08:58,534
Hmm. Purple and black.

1254
01:08:58,617 --> 01:09:00,995
- Ooh.
- And blue.

1255
01:09:01,078 --> 01:09:04,123
That'll be great.
And then maybe in the middle,

1256
01:09:04,206 --> 01:09:07,293
you could, like, add
some fire or something.

1257
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:08,919
- Totes.
- You know?

1258
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:10,755
Oh, wow.

1259
01:09:10,838 --> 01:09:12,298
- Hey.
- Hey, Swan.

1260
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:17,762
- You like it?
- Yeah. No, this is, uh... this is somethin'.

1261
01:09:17,845 --> 01:09:19,645
Maddy, I don't know
if we can keep this goin'.

1262
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:20,723
Why not?

1263
01:09:20,806 --> 01:09:23,309
Well, because they're... they're walls.

1264
01:09:23,392 --> 01:09:25,936
Our house isn't the house for this.

1265
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:28,939
Grandma... Grandma's house, those walls

1266
01:09:29,023 --> 01:09:31,583
are the walls you wanna write on
because all her walls are white.

1267
01:09:32,109 --> 01:09:33,569
Are you visiting your grandma soon?

1268
01:09:33,652 --> 01:09:36,363
- Yeah. It's her birthday.
- Ooh, nice.

1269
01:09:37,073 --> 01:09:38,616
Is Swan still here?

1270
01:09:38,699 --> 01:09:40,826
Yes. She's actually in the hallway.

1271
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:43,037
- Is she gonna stay here?
- Not tonight.

1272
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:45,998
She wanted to come in
and tell you good night though, okay?

1273
01:09:46,082 --> 01:09:46,916
Yeah?

1274
01:09:46,999 --> 01:09:47,999
Swan?

1275
01:09:48,375 --> 01:09:50,127
Hmm?

1276
01:09:50,628 --> 01:09:51,879
Hey, Maddy.

1277
01:09:51,962 --> 01:09:54,590
So I had a blast today. Did you have fun?

1278
01:09:54,673 --> 01:09:55,508
- Yeah.
- Good.

1279
01:09:55,591 --> 01:09:58,761
Is she gonna sleep in your bed
when she does sleep here?

1280
01:10:00,387 --> 01:10:02,765
Yuck. Yuck.

1281
01:10:02,848 --> 01:10:05,267
- No, I think that's... that's disgusting.
- Ick.

1282
01:10:05,351 --> 01:10:07,603
Yeah. Yuck to death.

1283
01:10:07,686 --> 01:10:09,355
She'll sleep in the bathtub.

1284
01:10:10,189 --> 01:10:11,732
You can borrow a pillow if you want.

1285
01:10:11,816 --> 01:10:14,443
That is so nice.
That'll make it more comfortable.

1286
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:16,028
- So generous.
- Yeah.

1287
01:10:16,112 --> 01:10:18,197
You should take notes.

1288
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:21,075
- 'Night, Maddy.
- Good night. Get some rest.

1289
01:10:22,493 --> 01:10:24,411
You forgot the two kisses.

1290
01:10:28,165 --> 01:10:30,126
I almost did.

1291
01:10:30,209 --> 01:10:34,296
That's one from me. And...
...that's a big one from Mommy. Okay?

1292
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:35,380
I love you.

1293
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,091
Get some sleep.

1294
01:10:46,892 --> 01:10:51,147
- You okay?
- Um, no, I just forgot somethin'.

1295
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:52,898
I'm a little upset at myself.

1296
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:56,193
Um, thank you.
You were great with her today.

1297
01:10:57,111 --> 01:10:58,028
Please.

1298
01:10:58,112 --> 01:11:01,782
It was easy. Maddy is fantastic.

1299
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:08,831
Maybe you could come over to my place
in the morning after dropping Maddy off?

1300
01:11:09,748 --> 01:11:12,376
You might get a little lucky
if you bring me a latte.

1301
01:11:13,878 --> 01:11:14,878
Okay.

1302
01:11:18,299 --> 01:11:19,860
- Mr. Logelin.
- I gotta get out of here.

1303
01:11:19,884 --> 01:11:21,604
It's so late. I'm sorry.

1304
01:11:38,194 --> 01:11:42,031
Here we have a rule
that all girl students wear skirts.

1305
01:11:42,114 --> 01:11:44,700
Rules?
We don't need no stinkin' rules.

1306
01:11:44,783 --> 01:11:46,243
That's what my dad says.

1307
01:11:46,327 --> 01:11:48,829
Okay. Well, your daddy signed a paper

1308
01:11:48,913 --> 01:11:51,081
when you were first accepted
at this school,

1309
01:11:51,165 --> 01:11:53,167
and he agreed to follow the rules.

1310
01:11:55,252 --> 01:11:57,296
Sister Kathleen would like you
to follow the rules

1311
01:11:57,379 --> 01:11:59,673
and wear this skirt starting today.

1312
01:12:19,235 --> 01:12:20,402
Are those boys' underwear?

1313
01:12:21,237 --> 01:12:23,239
Maddy wears boys' underwear.
Everyone, look.

1314
01:12:23,322 --> 01:12:25,616
- Maddy wears boys' underwear.
- Look, boys' underwear!

1315
01:12:25,699 --> 01:12:29,036
- Boys' underwear! Boys' underwear!
- Zip it, Darren!

1316
01:12:29,119 --> 01:12:31,455
- You zip it.
- I'm warning you, Darren.

1317
01:12:31,538 --> 01:12:32,998
- Boys' underwear!
- Boys' underwear!

1318
01:12:33,082 --> 01:12:34,082
Cannonball!

1319
01:12:42,925 --> 01:12:45,928
I want my daddy!

1320
01:13:00,234 --> 01:13:01,234
Where's Daddy?

1321
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:03,404
We're still trying to reach him.

1322
01:13:20,337 --> 01:13:21,380
Maddy Logelin?

1323
01:13:21,922 --> 01:13:22,922
Thank you.

1324
01:13:23,716 --> 01:13:25,676
Maddy? Maddy?

1325
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:26,759
- Daddy!
- Maddy.

1326
01:13:27,303 --> 01:13:30,014
Hey. Oh my God, Maddy.

1327
01:13:30,097 --> 01:13:32,850
Hey. Hey, babe.

1328
01:13:32,933 --> 01:13:34,310
Oh, let me see. Let me see.

1329
01:13:34,393 --> 01:13:36,478
- Mr. Logelin, I--
- Please, please.

1330
01:13:37,271 --> 01:13:38,397
How you doin', huh?

1331
01:13:39,273 --> 01:13:40,274
I'm sorry, Daddy.

1332
01:13:40,357 --> 01:13:41,358
What?

1333
01:13:41,442 --> 01:13:42,943
You're sorry? No.

1334
01:13:43,027 --> 01:13:46,280
You don't... you don't have to be sorry.
Dad, Daddy's sorry.

1335
01:13:46,363 --> 01:13:48,115
Okay, come on. We're leavin'.

1336
01:13:48,198 --> 01:13:50,200
- Sir, sir, sir, wait.
- No!

1337
01:13:50,284 --> 01:13:52,119
- Wait, sir, she needs stitches.
- No!

1338
01:13:52,745 --> 01:13:53,829
Listen to me.

1339
01:13:53,912 --> 01:13:56,933
We're not doin' anything here because
you don't know how to do nothin' right.

1340
01:13:56,957 --> 01:13:59,293
I've been here. No, thank you. Come on.

1341
01:13:59,376 --> 01:14:01,086
I know she's gonna have
a substantial scar

1342
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:02,379
if she doesn't get stitches.

1343
01:14:13,057 --> 01:14:14,058
Look at me.

1344
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:17,144
You're so strong.

1345
01:14:18,395 --> 01:14:21,190
Such a strong little girl. Okay?

1346
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:23,191
I'm proud.

1347
01:14:23,817 --> 01:14:25,027
Guess who else is proud?

1348
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:27,988
Mommy. Mommy would be proud right now.

1349
01:14:29,156 --> 01:14:30,908
We're gonna go get some stitches, okay?

1350
01:14:32,117 --> 01:14:33,535
Squeeze my hand, that's all.

1351
01:14:34,661 --> 01:14:35,661
There you go.

1352
01:14:38,707 --> 01:14:40,793
Mm-hmm-hmm. Good job, Maddy.

1353
01:14:43,379 --> 01:14:44,421
You're doin' good.

1354
01:14:47,758 --> 01:14:49,176
- Hey.
- Hey.

1355
01:14:49,259 --> 01:14:51,095
I've been calling. Is she all right?

1356
01:14:52,054 --> 01:14:53,430
Yeah, um...

1357
01:14:55,057 --> 01:14:56,100
Sorry I didn't pick up.

1358
01:14:56,183 --> 01:14:59,478
I'm just, uh, a little upset because
I feel like I should've been there sooner.

1359
01:15:00,396 --> 01:15:02,707
You can't blame yourself.
It was just an accident.

1360
01:15:02,731 --> 01:15:03,731
I actually can.

1361
01:15:04,775 --> 01:15:07,361
I can blame myself because I wasn't there.

1362
01:15:07,444 --> 01:15:09,844
Anything could've happened to her.
She could've lost her eye.

1363
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:10,905
She didn't.

1364
01:15:10,948 --> 01:15:12,699
- She could have.
- But she didn't.

1365
01:15:15,661 --> 01:15:19,957
Can I, um... can I see her?
I brought her this guy.

1366
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
It's very sweet.

1367
01:15:24,378 --> 01:15:25,879
I think she's sleeping though.

1368
01:15:28,715 --> 01:15:31,427
I just think
that, right now, she's not ready.

1369
01:15:34,138 --> 01:15:37,266
- Ready for what?
- For this. She's not ready for

1370
01:15:38,308 --> 01:15:39,351
this, this.

1371
01:15:39,435 --> 01:15:41,019
She's not ready, or you're not ready?

1372
01:15:41,103 --> 01:15:45,023
Look, Swan,
the hospital that I was at today,

1373
01:15:46,567 --> 01:15:48,569
it's the same hospital that Liz died in.

1374
01:15:49,319 --> 01:15:53,532
I mean, thank God, thank God today
I got there in time to hold her hand.

1375
01:15:54,992 --> 01:15:57,244
Because with Liz, it was different.
With Liz,

1376
01:15:57,953 --> 01:16:00,789
I didn't get to hold her hand.
I got shoved out the room.

1377
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:07,546
I got shoved out the room,
and when I came back, she was gone.

1378
01:16:07,629 --> 01:16:08,629
Hmm.

1379
01:16:10,007 --> 01:16:11,526
She was gone, and there was a little...

1380
01:16:11,550 --> 01:16:13,802
there was a tube
stickin' out of her mouth.

1381
01:16:17,890 --> 01:16:21,685
Matt, I am so sorry
that happened to you.

1382
01:16:21,768 --> 01:16:23,562
It didn't happen to me.

1383
01:16:24,646 --> 01:16:25,647
That's the problem.

1384
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:29,485
It did not happen to me.

1385
01:16:30,152 --> 01:16:31,463
- Okay.
- So don't be sorry.

1386
01:16:31,487 --> 01:16:32,654
Don't be sorry for me.

1387
01:16:33,155 --> 01:16:37,117
Okay, I'm, um, um... I'm, um... I'm gonna go.

1388
01:16:38,368 --> 01:16:40,204
Would you give Maddy my love please?

1389
01:16:53,592 --> 01:16:54,968
What's going on?
What's wrong?

1390
01:16:55,052 --> 01:16:57,387
I can't find Mommy's necklace.

1391
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:59,765
You can't find it?
Did you misplace it?

1392
01:16:59,848 --> 01:17:01,266
I don't remember.

1393
01:17:02,142 --> 01:17:03,894
What do you mean,
you don't remember?

1394
01:17:03,977 --> 01:17:05,896
Do you think it came off
on the playground?

1395
01:17:05,979 --> 01:17:06,979
Maybe.

1396
01:17:07,773 --> 01:17:09,900
Okay, all right. Hey, hey, hey.

1397
01:17:09,983 --> 01:17:12,110
It will come up. All right?

1398
01:17:13,779 --> 01:17:16,281
- I need you to go to Croatia.
- Croatia?

1399
01:17:16,365 --> 01:17:17,533
Yeah, just for a month.

1400
01:17:17,616 --> 01:17:19,326
Just set up the office there. That's all.

1401
01:17:19,409 --> 01:17:22,829
Why don't you send Oscar?
His wife's Croatian. He speaks Croatian.

1402
01:17:22,913 --> 01:17:23,956
- He does?
- Yes.

1403
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:26,542
Yeah, I don't care.
I'm gonna send you. I trust you.

1404
01:17:26,625 --> 01:17:29,062
Howard, that's tough, man.
That... that's really tough for me.

1405
01:17:29,086 --> 01:17:31,964
I don't know if I can leave Maddy
for over a month. I can't do that.

1406
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:34,925
It's an opportunity.
College tuition's not gettin' any cheaper.

1407
01:17:35,008 --> 01:17:37,048
College tuition?
I'm trying to get through the week.

1408
01:17:37,094 --> 01:17:40,305
Yeah, well, hey, that's how it happens.
Think about it.

1409
01:17:40,889 --> 01:17:41,932
I don't need to...

1410
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:49,565
Yeah, I mean,
I should be traveling for work right now.

1411
01:17:49,648 --> 01:17:52,728
I just don't... I don't know if I wanna
leave her with a friend for that long.

1412
01:17:52,776 --> 01:17:55,195
And this is
just the beginnin' travel-wise.

1413
01:17:55,279 --> 01:17:57,656
Welcome to not knowing
the right thing to do.

1414
01:17:58,156 --> 01:17:59,616
That's a dad specialty.

1415
01:18:00,325 --> 01:18:01,325
Hmm.

1416
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:08,083
Is Swan coming to Minnesota?

1417
01:18:09,626 --> 01:18:11,003
Uh...

1418
01:18:11,128 --> 01:18:13,380
I don't think we're gonna be seeing
much of Swan anymore.

1419
01:18:13,463 --> 01:18:14,798
Why not?

1420
01:18:14,881 --> 01:18:17,217
Because Swan and I broke up.

1421
01:18:17,301 --> 01:18:19,845
What?
You didn't talk to me about that!

1422
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:22,639
I did not talk to you about it
because I don't need your permission.

1423
01:18:22,723 --> 01:18:24,516
Call her and say you're still going out.

1424
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:25,976
No. It doesn't work like that.

1425
01:18:26,059 --> 01:18:27,059
So make it work.

1426
01:18:27,102 --> 01:18:30,147
Stop. You're pushin' it. I don't even know
why you're actin' like you care.

1427
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:31,773
You didn't even wanna meet her.

1428
01:18:31,857 --> 01:18:34,359
Yeah, but now I know her.
And we need more people.

1429
01:18:34,443 --> 01:18:37,279
- Other people have more people.
- What are you talking about, Maddy?

1430
01:18:37,362 --> 01:18:38,697
It's always just us.

1431
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:40,657
Oh, I'm sorry for being your dad.

1432
01:18:40,741 --> 01:18:42,784
I'm sorry for bein' around.
Is that what you want?

1433
01:18:43,285 --> 01:18:44,786
It's not even just us all the time.

1434
01:18:44,870 --> 01:18:47,831
You got Jordan.
You got Oscar. You got Poker Sundays.

1435
01:18:47,914 --> 01:18:50,250
Swan's not at Poker Sunday.

1436
01:18:50,334 --> 01:18:52,044
Because Swan does not play poker.

1437
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:53,127
I don't care!

1438
01:18:53,170 --> 01:18:57,132
I like her, and I like my grandmas
and Grandpa Mike. And we never see them!

1439
01:18:57,215 --> 01:18:59,343
Okay, what are you talkin' about?
Where are we goin'?

1440
01:18:59,426 --> 01:19:02,888
How come, when something good happens,
it always gets taken away?

1441
01:19:05,682 --> 01:19:07,351
I don't have an answer for that.

1442
01:19:07,434 --> 01:19:09,978
And I don't have an answer
for anything else you wanna ask me.

1443
01:19:10,062 --> 01:19:11,438
Don't ask me no more questions.

1444
01:19:11,521 --> 01:19:13,482
For the rest of the day,
for the whole flight,

1445
01:19:13,565 --> 01:19:15,405
I'm not answerin'
nothin' else that you ask me.

1446
01:19:15,442 --> 01:19:17,694
Do you hear me?
Question time is over.

1447
01:19:17,778 --> 01:19:20,072
I give you an inch,
you take a mile. Carry your bag.

1448
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:23,492
- Uh!
- What? Who you uh-ing? Who--

1449
01:19:23,575 --> 01:19:27,037
Hey, stop stompin',
I'll tell you that much.

1450
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:31,833
We are going to have so much fun.
Your cousins are waiting for you, Maddy.

1451
01:19:31,917 --> 01:19:36,004
Yeah, wait till you see your room, girl.
It is fabulous.

1452
01:19:36,088 --> 01:19:38,465
Yeah, come on in.

1453
01:19:38,548 --> 01:19:41,051
That's your art on the wall there.

1454
01:19:41,134 --> 01:19:43,011
Cool.

1455
01:19:44,137 --> 01:19:45,430
I like to unpack,

1456
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:50,060
because I don't like things
to be all in a jumble in my luggage,

1457
01:19:50,143 --> 01:19:51,853
and I can't find anything.

1458
01:19:54,147 --> 01:19:55,774
I lost Mommy's necklace.

1459
01:19:55,857 --> 01:19:58,402
Yeah. Your daddy told me.

1460
01:19:59,611 --> 01:20:01,488
Why don't I buy you another necklace?

1461
01:20:01,571 --> 01:20:03,448
It won't be the one Daddy bought Mommy.

1462
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:06,618
That's true. That's true.

1463
01:20:08,412 --> 01:20:09,454
What was she like?

1464
01:20:13,417 --> 01:20:17,546
Your mom was the best!

1465
01:20:18,255 --> 01:20:22,926
'Cause she was strong and smart.

1466
01:20:23,009 --> 01:20:25,512
You... you know, you remind me a lot of her.

1467
01:20:26,388 --> 01:20:29,516
Hey, should we take a little Mommy tour
around the neighborhood?

1468
01:20:29,599 --> 01:20:31,518
- Yeah.
- Just the two of us. Come on.

1469
01:20:31,601 --> 01:20:34,896
That's where your mommy's best friend,
Anastacia, lived.

1470
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:37,691
Stacy. There's a creek behind their house,

1471
01:20:37,774 --> 01:20:41,486
and they used to go off
in there, diggin' up tadpoles.

1472
01:20:42,487 --> 01:20:44,948
And they would bring
all of that smelly mess

1473
01:20:45,031 --> 01:20:47,242
and mud into my kitchen.

1474
01:20:47,325 --> 01:20:49,411
And then, every Saturday morning,

1475
01:20:49,494 --> 01:20:53,790
this is where
your mom would come and play soccer!

1476
01:21:19,691 --> 01:21:23,570
Hey, um, is Liz's room
permanently set up for Maddy now?

1477
01:21:23,653 --> 01:21:24,696
Yes, yes.

1478
01:21:25,822 --> 01:21:27,741
- Is that problematic?
- I think it's confusin'.

1479
01:21:28,617 --> 01:21:31,369
With all she's been through,
the accident and everything else.

1480
01:21:31,453 --> 01:21:33,497
Well, it wasn't exactly an accident.

1481
01:21:34,372 --> 01:21:35,582
What is that supposed to mean?

1482
01:21:35,665 --> 01:21:38,794
If you had followed the rules
the school asked you to follow

1483
01:21:38,877 --> 01:21:41,213
instead of encouragin' her to act out.

1484
01:21:41,296 --> 01:21:42,547
You don't think I know that?

1485
01:21:43,340 --> 01:21:45,509
You don't think
I blame myself for what happened?

1486
01:21:45,592 --> 01:21:48,178
You don't really expect me
to argue that, do you?

1487
01:21:49,429 --> 01:21:51,264
- Let it go.
- Why do I try, man?

1488
01:21:51,348 --> 01:21:53,475
- We are all trying.
- No, we're not.

1489
01:21:53,558 --> 01:21:56,269
- We have nothing in common outside of Liz.
- We have--

1490
01:21:56,353 --> 01:21:58,480
- Nothing in common!
- We have Maddy.

1491
01:21:58,563 --> 01:22:02,442
Mike, I apologize to you.
I'm not stayin' here. I'm not.

1492
01:22:02,526 --> 01:22:06,279
- I'm not dealin' with you.
- Oh, please.

1493
01:22:07,072 --> 01:22:10,158
I think you both sorta have
a thing or two in common.

1494
01:22:13,787 --> 01:22:15,205
What are you doing?

1495
01:22:15,288 --> 01:22:17,874
We're leavin'.
We're goin' over to Grandma Anna's.

1496
01:22:17,958 --> 01:22:19,918
I don't wanna leave!
I wanna stay here!

1497
01:22:20,001 --> 01:22:23,755
Hey, hey. Don't start with me, Maddy.
All right? It's just for a little bit.

1498
01:22:24,339 --> 01:22:25,674
You never listen to me.

1499
01:22:25,757 --> 01:22:26,967
Maddy.

1500
01:22:27,050 --> 01:22:29,511
This was Mommy's room,
and I wanna stay here.

1501
01:22:29,594 --> 01:22:31,721
I wanna live here
with Grammy and Granddad.

1502
01:22:31,805 --> 01:22:33,723
Why can't we both stay here?

1503
01:22:33,807 --> 01:22:35,183
I don't wanna go back.

1504
01:22:36,393 --> 01:22:38,019
I don't wanna go to St. Joseph,

1505
01:22:38,103 --> 01:22:40,397
even if Mommy wanted me to wear a uniform.

1506
01:22:47,863 --> 01:22:49,197
Okay, listen...

1507
01:22:53,827 --> 01:22:55,829
Mommy would have wanted you to be happy.

1508
01:22:58,957 --> 01:23:01,585
That's what Mommy would have wanted.
Come here.

1509
01:23:31,865 --> 01:23:32,865
How's Maddy?

1510
01:23:33,533 --> 01:23:34,576
Happy.

1511
01:23:36,870 --> 01:23:38,997
She seems really happy over there.

1512
01:23:41,082 --> 01:23:42,834
- You know what I was thinkin' about?
- Hmm?

1513
01:23:42,918 --> 01:23:45,128
That time when I asked Dad
could I go live with him

1514
01:23:45,211 --> 01:23:47,051
'cause you wouldn't let me
do what I wanted to.

1515
01:23:47,088 --> 01:23:52,552
I certainly remember. He brought you
right back here, all across town.

1516
01:23:54,137 --> 01:23:55,137
He knew.

1517
01:23:56,181 --> 01:23:58,934
It's probably
the least selfish thing he ever did.

1518
01:24:15,158 --> 01:24:17,452
You count.

1519
01:24:17,535 --> 01:24:19,120
One, two, three.

1520
01:24:25,585 --> 01:24:28,380
Okay, everybody, who wants cake?

1521
01:24:33,176 --> 01:24:34,928
Sweetheart, um...

1522
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:39,975
I made a deal with you when...

1523
01:24:40,642 --> 01:24:42,185
when you were a baby

1524
01:24:43,269 --> 01:24:48,733
to... always try and do
what was best for you.

1525
01:24:50,777 --> 01:24:53,405
And right now, I can't. I can't move here.

1526
01:24:56,032 --> 01:25:00,120
You know, but that shouldn't mean
that you... that you can't.

1527
01:25:03,123 --> 01:25:06,126
You know, Grandma Marion and Grandpa Mike,

1528
01:25:08,211 --> 01:25:09,504
they brought up Mommy.

1529
01:25:11,131 --> 01:25:12,424
And Mommy was the best.

1530
01:25:12,507 --> 01:25:13,842
She was just like you.

1531
01:25:15,719 --> 01:25:16,928
You know, um...

1532
01:25:22,058 --> 01:25:25,061
You and your mom are
the best thing that ever happened to me.

1533
01:25:31,026 --> 01:25:32,402
And I, uh...

1534
01:25:35,947 --> 01:25:38,116
I wanna... I wanna thank you...

1535
01:25:40,785 --> 01:25:42,120
for taking care of me.

1536
01:25:46,458 --> 01:25:48,251
I want you to know that I tried,

1537
01:25:50,211 --> 01:25:53,798
but... I know that you're happy here.

1538
01:25:55,925 --> 01:25:58,928
I just wanna do
what your mom would have wanted me to do.

1539
01:26:03,099 --> 01:26:04,099
Two kisses.

1540
01:26:04,768 --> 01:26:08,563
- One for Mommy.
- One for me.

1541
01:26:19,115 --> 01:26:20,115
Hey.

1542
01:26:23,119 --> 01:26:24,370
This is gonna be fun.

1543
01:26:26,247 --> 01:26:27,791
It's gonna be so much fun, you know.

1544
01:26:27,874 --> 01:26:30,835
You get to... you get to spend time
with Grandma and Grandpa.

1545
01:26:32,587 --> 01:26:33,505
You'll be back?

1546
01:26:33,588 --> 01:26:36,674
Yeah, yes. Of course, I'll be back.

1547
01:26:36,758 --> 01:26:40,970
You know, Dad's just gotta go,
gotta go to work and, you know,

1548
01:26:41,054 --> 01:26:45,475
take care of some stuff.
And I don't... I don't wanna be selfish.

1549
01:26:46,226 --> 01:26:49,437
I want you to spend time
with... with your family here.

1550
01:26:50,355 --> 01:26:53,608
All right? It'll be great.
This will be... this will be good.

1551
01:26:54,734 --> 01:26:55,734
Okay?

1552
01:26:56,319 --> 01:26:57,403
All right, give me a hug.

1553
01:26:58,238 --> 01:26:59,238
Mmm.

1554
01:27:16,297 --> 01:27:18,091
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1555
01:28:12,103 --> 01:28:16,357
Look, Matt, um, now,
I know you don't really wanna hear this,

1556
01:28:16,441 --> 01:28:23,364
but, like, honestly, none of us thought
you would've did the job you did.

1557
01:28:23,448 --> 01:28:24,282
Hmm.

1558
01:28:24,365 --> 01:28:26,201
We thought you didn't have a chance

1559
01:28:26,284 --> 01:28:28,161
of taking care
of this little girl by yourself.

1560
01:28:28,244 --> 01:28:32,916
Honestly, you did a way better job
than any of us thought you would do, man.

1561
01:28:32,999 --> 01:28:35,710
You should be proud of yourself, man.
You did that.

1562
01:28:35,793 --> 01:28:38,046
I mean, she ain't die, right?

1563
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,590
- I mean, I fed her.
- Yeah.

1564
01:28:42,342 --> 01:28:44,886
Put Pampers on her, gave her some clothes.

1565
01:28:46,179 --> 01:28:47,179
Yeah.

1566
01:28:48,473 --> 01:28:49,682
Yeah, that's a good job.

1567
01:28:50,558 --> 01:28:55,730
I mean, what I did, you gotta say, it was
probably the bare minimum of parenting.

1568
01:28:55,813 --> 01:28:57,398
That should be enough, right?

1569
01:28:57,482 --> 01:28:59,067
I think you're being hard on yourself.

1570
01:28:59,150 --> 01:29:01,903
- I didn't mean it like--
- No, I'm not being hard on myself.

1571
01:29:02,862 --> 01:29:05,156
Nobody else thought
that I could raise my child.

1572
01:29:05,782 --> 01:29:06,782
So, why did I?

1573
01:29:07,825 --> 01:29:09,244
What am I doin'?

1574
01:29:09,994 --> 01:29:12,038
What am I doin'?
What decision am I making,

1575
01:29:12,121 --> 01:29:14,749
and who's the decision best for?
'Cause I don't know.

1576
01:29:16,251 --> 01:29:17,251
Cheers.

1577
01:29:17,835 --> 01:29:19,875
- I'm not... I'm not cheering that.
- I did it.

1578
01:29:24,884 --> 01:29:26,803
Matt, come on in.

1579
01:29:26,886 --> 01:29:29,347
Close the door. Grab a chair.

1580
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:30,348
Yes, sir.

1581
01:29:30,431 --> 01:29:33,393
I got... got some bad news.

1582
01:29:33,476 --> 01:29:34,644
Bad news?

1583
01:29:35,311 --> 01:29:36,646
I'm leavin'.

1584
01:29:38,147 --> 01:29:41,401
I'm leaving the office.
I'm, uh, moving up that chain.

1585
01:29:41,484 --> 01:29:44,696
And I've recommended you
to take over my job.

1586
01:29:46,531 --> 01:29:49,200
Yeah, I... I figured
now you got more time to focus.

1587
01:29:49,284 --> 01:29:51,911
You can travel more for work.
I think you're ready.

1588
01:29:53,079 --> 01:29:56,040
This could... this could be yours.
Also throwin' in...

1589
01:29:58,084 --> 01:29:59,210
a new salary.

1590
01:30:02,547 --> 01:30:04,215
It says, "Buy dog food."

1591
01:30:04,299 --> 01:30:05,299
Turn it over.

1592
01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:10,679
Wow.

1593
01:30:11,097 --> 01:30:14,726
- There's your college tuition.
- I mean, I... I don't know what to say.

1594
01:30:14,809 --> 01:30:16,602
You know what?
You deserve it.

1595
01:30:16,686 --> 01:30:17,562
Thank you.

1596
01:30:17,645 --> 01:30:19,272
You deserve it.

1597
01:30:19,355 --> 01:30:21,733
You know...
...I'm proud of you.

1598
01:30:21,816 --> 01:30:24,610
I don't know why, I've always felt
sorta like a father figure to you.

1599
01:30:24,694 --> 01:30:26,446
- Hmm?
- Not a father, but, you know,

1600
01:30:26,529 --> 01:30:28,489
like a... an uncle maybe or a cousin.

1601
01:30:28,573 --> 01:30:31,409
Kinda like a... a... a big brother.

1602
01:30:32,744 --> 01:30:34,746
Neighbor?
Maybe I felt like a neighbor.

1603
01:30:34,829 --> 01:30:36,706
- Big... bigger, older neighbor.
- Got ya.

1604
01:30:36,789 --> 01:30:39,792
And I don't wanna get all sappy.
I'm not gonna get all sappy.

1605
01:30:39,876 --> 01:30:41,336
You don't have to really get into--

1606
01:30:41,419 --> 01:30:43,671
I'm not... I'm not--
No, no. But what I wanna say...

1607
01:30:46,007 --> 01:30:47,633
I'm very glad I didn't fire you.

1608
01:30:48,801 --> 01:30:50,094
I'm, um...

1609
01:30:52,096 --> 01:30:53,096
I'm glad too.

1610
01:30:55,266 --> 01:30:56,266
You're a good man.

1611
01:30:57,143 --> 01:30:59,645
Now go kick some ass in Croatia.

1612
01:30:59,729 --> 01:31:01,731
- And next month, London.
- Okay.

1613
01:31:04,859 --> 01:31:06,459
I'm gonna see that and raise it.

1614
01:31:07,695 --> 01:31:08,695
What is that?

1615
01:31:09,322 --> 01:31:12,075
- Don't waste our time. Just fold.
- Don't fold, J.

1616
01:31:12,158 --> 01:31:14,118
Am I the only one that feel like this?

1617
01:31:14,202 --> 01:31:16,287
Does it feel weird that Maddy's not here?

1618
01:31:17,205 --> 01:31:18,748
- Yeah, yeah, it does.
- Huh?

1619
01:31:19,374 --> 01:31:20,934
We usually, like, play with, you know...

1620
01:31:20,958 --> 01:31:22,061
- Cookies. Yeah.
- ...cookies.

1621
01:31:22,085 --> 01:31:24,253
Cookies. I mean, the chips,
you know, that's cool too.

1622
01:31:24,337 --> 01:31:25,671
You know, cash game,

1623
01:31:25,755 --> 01:31:28,216
but do you have any, uh...
you know, do you have any cookies?

1624
01:31:28,299 --> 01:31:29,899
You want cookies? Is that what you want?

1625
01:31:29,926 --> 01:31:31,904
- We'll take some cookies.
- Cookies would be great.

1626
01:31:31,928 --> 01:31:33,768
Tell you what,
I'mma bring the cookie out here.

1627
01:31:33,805 --> 01:31:35,306
Y'all better eat every damn cookie.

1628
01:31:35,390 --> 01:31:36,390
- Okay.
- You hear me?

1629
01:31:36,432 --> 01:31:38,601
- Yes.
- You better eat every damn cookie.

1630
01:31:38,684 --> 01:31:40,686
Or else it's gonna be a problem out here.

1631
01:31:41,187 --> 01:31:43,940
Let it be a cookie left
after I bring these cookies out.

1632
01:31:44,524 --> 01:31:47,443
I mean, all he had to do
is say he miss her too, you know.

1633
01:33:42,350 --> 01:33:44,435
The snacks are okay.
Not super international,

1634
01:33:44,519 --> 01:33:45,853
but they do have Brazil nuts.

1635
01:33:46,354 --> 01:33:49,857
Dude, thanks so much
for taking me on this trip. Seriously.

1636
01:33:50,566 --> 01:33:51,692
So psyched to be wingman.

1637
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:54,654
Yeah, well,
my Croatian's a little rusty, man.

1638
01:33:55,238 --> 01:33:57,740
- Teach me some stuff.
- Yeah, for sure. Okay.

1639
01:33:58,324 --> 01:34:00,952
Uh, repeat after me. Začepi.

1640
01:34:01,994 --> 01:34:03,746
- Začepi.
- Začepi.

1641
01:34:03,829 --> 01:34:05,998
- What does that mean?
- It means, "Be quiet."

1642
01:34:06,582 --> 01:34:08,167
- "Be quiet"?
- Začepi.

1643
01:34:09,252 --> 01:34:10,896
Why would I...
why would I wanna learn that?

1644
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:14,674
Well, I mean,
you know, have you met me?

1645
01:34:14,757 --> 01:34:16,259
- Začepi?
- Yeah.

1646
01:34:16,342 --> 01:34:18,970
My wife says that all the time.
You know, "Začepi."

1647
01:34:19,053 --> 01:34:20,053
You know?

1648
01:34:20,471 --> 01:34:24,850
Look. Look at the duck.
Look at the ducky. Look at the ducky.

1649
01:34:25,643 --> 01:34:26,852
Look at the duck.

1650
01:34:28,854 --> 01:34:30,106
Look at the ducks.

1651
01:34:31,023 --> 01:34:32,692
Oh, yeah.

1652
01:34:33,442 --> 01:34:34,986
You like that duck?

1653
01:34:35,486 --> 01:34:36,486
Huh?

1654
01:34:37,029 --> 01:34:38,155
You like that duck?

1655
01:34:39,323 --> 01:34:41,450
No? Come on.
Let's see the next one.

1656
01:34:42,868 --> 01:34:44,579
Ooh, ooh. What about this duck?

1657
01:34:45,079 --> 01:34:46,163
You like that duck?

1658
01:34:47,290 --> 01:34:48,708
No? All right.

1659
01:34:48,791 --> 01:34:50,293
This one was my favorite.

1660
01:34:50,376 --> 01:34:54,005
- She says that one was her favorite.
- Because it always looks at the sun.

1661
01:34:55,840 --> 01:35:00,428
Okay. I love you, Dad.
I'll call you when I get back to the dorm.

1662
01:35:01,178 --> 01:35:02,763
No, I'm not nervous.

1663
01:35:03,389 --> 01:35:04,389
Yeah.

1664
01:35:04,849 --> 01:35:07,351
Yeah. I can do anything.

1665
01:35:09,812 --> 01:35:11,439
- Bro. Look.
- What?

1666
01:35:12,273 --> 01:35:13,649
Oh my goodness.

1667
01:35:14,442 --> 01:35:17,194
Maddy. Hey. Hey.

1668
01:35:17,278 --> 01:35:19,030
Come here. You can do it, Maddy.

1669
01:35:20,740 --> 01:35:21,740
Jordan!
Jordan!

1670
01:35:22,408 --> 01:35:23,408
Come on, Maddy!

1671
01:35:24,702 --> 01:35:26,142
- Come on, Maddy!
- Come on.

1672
01:35:26,203 --> 01:35:28,122
Jordan, do you see this?

1673
01:35:28,205 --> 01:35:30,625
- Are you watching?
- I'm watching this.

1674
01:35:30,708 --> 01:35:31,876
Oh my gosh.

1675
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:34,420
Hey! Jordan!

1676
01:35:36,631 --> 01:35:37,673
Jordan! She walkin'!

1677
01:35:40,009 --> 01:35:43,262
Somebody's cuttin' onions
or something close to us. I don't know.

1678
01:35:46,891 --> 01:35:48,392
Ready for your first day?

1679
01:35:48,476 --> 01:35:51,520
This is gonna be kinda tough because
she's never been around anybody but me.

1680
01:35:51,604 --> 01:35:54,440
So there's probably gonna be
separation issues. But you're a big girl.

1681
01:35:54,523 --> 01:35:58,152
- Give daddy two kisses.
- One for me, one for Mommy. Okay?

1682
01:35:58,861 --> 01:35:59,861
Mmm.

1683
01:36:00,738 --> 01:36:01,738
Mmm.

1684
01:36:03,616 --> 01:36:06,077
Maddy. Maddy.

1685
01:36:07,328 --> 01:36:08,968
I'll just hang out to watch a little bit.

1686
01:36:09,038 --> 01:36:10,581
- Sure. No problem.
- Okay?

1687
01:36:11,999 --> 01:36:13,793
We should probably head
to the gate.

1688
01:36:14,377 --> 01:36:17,505
Oh, do you want to, um, talk or sleep,
you know, on the flight?

1689
01:36:18,214 --> 01:36:20,966
I tend to do both, actually.
Talk in my sleep.

1690
01:36:21,050 --> 01:36:24,220
Um, so if I do,
just, you know, kind of nudge me awake,

1691
01:36:24,303 --> 01:36:26,555
or you can probably even talk
to me, actually.

1692
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:28,808
I'm pretty interesting
when I'm sleep-talking.

1693
01:36:28,891 --> 01:36:29,892
I believe in you.

1694
01:36:31,936 --> 01:36:34,355
Thanks, man. I mean, that's really sweet.

1695
01:36:34,438 --> 01:36:35,690
I... I believe in you too.

1696
01:36:36,482 --> 01:36:39,402
- Matt?
- I really believe in you.

1697
01:36:39,485 --> 01:36:41,570
Uh, the gate's actually that way. Matt?

1698
01:36:41,654 --> 01:36:42,697
Začepi!

1699
01:36:44,573 --> 01:36:45,573
Got it.

1700
01:37:01,882 --> 01:37:02,882
Hey.

1701
01:37:03,509 --> 01:37:04,509
Hey.

1702
01:37:09,348 --> 01:37:13,227
Daddy!
Whoo!

1703
01:37:13,310 --> 01:37:17,565
- I didn't know you were coming today!
- Oh! I surprised you!

1704
01:37:17,648 --> 01:37:20,109
- Oh! Guess what?
- What?

1705
01:37:20,192 --> 01:37:21,527
Look what I found.

1706
01:37:21,610 --> 01:37:23,529
- You found it!
- Yes, I did.

1707
01:37:23,612 --> 01:37:26,332
I found it and said, "I gotta get
on a plane and fly all the way here

1708
01:37:26,365 --> 01:37:28,743
to give it to you myself in person."
Come here.

1709
01:37:30,035 --> 01:37:31,035
Let me see.

1710
01:37:33,622 --> 01:37:34,874
So let's go home.

1711
01:37:36,959 --> 01:37:37,793
Don't cry.

1712
01:37:37,877 --> 01:37:39,044
I'm not gonna cry.

1713
01:37:39,712 --> 01:37:41,839
Wherever you are, I wanna go there.

1714
01:37:43,674 --> 01:37:45,634
Wherever you are, I wanna go there too.

1715
01:37:46,635 --> 01:37:47,803
Give me a hug.

1716
01:37:47,887 --> 01:37:49,263
Mmm.

1717
01:37:52,641 --> 01:37:53,641
Mmm.

1718
01:37:55,394 --> 01:37:57,271
I'll see you back here
at Christmastime, okay?

1719
01:37:57,354 --> 01:37:58,354
Okay.

1720
01:37:58,689 --> 01:38:02,193
Come on, Maddy. Come on.
Right here. There you go.

1721
01:38:04,820 --> 01:38:06,405
I just wanna say thank you, Marion.

1722
01:38:07,698 --> 01:38:11,452
For... understanding, you know?

1723
01:38:14,121 --> 01:38:16,332
I don't understand anything anymore.

1724
01:38:18,876 --> 01:38:23,005
But I know... I know
that she would be so proud of you, Matt.

1725
01:38:24,089 --> 01:38:27,051
You know, she said you were the one

1726
01:38:27,676 --> 01:38:31,806
when you showed up
with those little grocery store flowers.

1727
01:38:31,889 --> 01:38:34,558
You had 'em gripped so tight,
you crushed the stems.

1728
01:38:34,642 --> 01:38:36,894
I did. I did.

1729
01:38:36,977 --> 01:38:40,147
I was... I was nervous as hell.

1730
01:38:40,731 --> 01:38:42,858
I remember that day like it was yesterday.

1731
01:38:44,819 --> 01:38:46,070
It was yesterday.

1732
01:39:00,376 --> 01:39:02,503
Take care of her.

1733
01:39:05,214 --> 01:39:06,423
Grammy loves you.

1734
01:39:06,507 --> 01:39:10,261
And Grandpa loves you too.
Give me a hug.

1735
01:39:10,344 --> 01:39:12,346
Okay, put you down, huh?
All right.

1736
01:39:12,429 --> 01:39:14,849
Take care of your papa. Travel safe.

1737
01:39:14,932 --> 01:39:16,725
- See you later, Mike.
- Mm-hmm.

1738
01:39:19,687 --> 01:39:20,771
- Dad?
- Hmm?

1739
01:39:20,855 --> 01:39:23,858
Are there the schools near us
where you don't wear a uniform?

1740
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:27,903
Uh, yes, there are, but I'm thinking
about sending you straight to college.

1741
01:39:27,987 --> 01:39:30,781
So, we won't have
to worry about that, okay?

1742
01:40:07,318 --> 01:40:08,152
Hey.

1743
01:40:08,235 --> 01:40:09,235
Hey.

1744
01:40:11,989 --> 01:40:14,241
We were in the neighborhood,
so we figured we'd stop by.

1745
01:40:14,325 --> 01:40:15,325
No, we weren't.

1746
01:40:15,743 --> 01:40:17,623
- We were in the neighborhood.
- No, we weren't.

1747
01:40:18,579 --> 01:40:19,413
We weren't.

1748
01:40:19,496 --> 01:40:23,918
We were not in the area.
But I stopped, and I... I got some flowers

1749
01:40:24,001 --> 01:40:27,004
that say, "Sorry for being an idiot."

1750
01:40:28,797 --> 01:40:31,842
I wanted to come and bring
the flowers by here and give them to you.

1751
01:40:31,926 --> 01:40:34,279
I didn't want you not to be here
then leave 'em on the step.

1752
01:40:34,303 --> 01:40:36,388
Then somebody come by,
they steal the flowers,

1753
01:40:36,472 --> 01:40:38,641
and you never get the flowers. You know--?

1754
01:40:38,724 --> 01:40:42,645
You know, there are a lot
of flower thieves in this building.

1755
01:40:42,728 --> 01:40:45,208
- I didn't wanna say nothin', but yeah.
- That's really astute.

1756
01:40:46,273 --> 01:40:47,273
Maddy?

1757
01:40:48,192 --> 01:40:50,069
It's so good to see you. How you been?

1758
01:40:50,152 --> 01:40:53,530
- I have a really loose tooth. Look.
- Ew.

1759
01:40:54,114 --> 01:40:56,575
Hey, tooth fairy will visit.

1760
01:41:02,164 --> 01:41:03,499
So, I'll take those.

1761
01:41:06,752 --> 01:41:07,752
I'm sorry.

1762
01:41:09,046 --> 01:41:10,046
Can you forgive me?

1763
01:41:12,132 --> 01:41:16,136
I... need to talk to Maddy for a second.

1764
01:41:17,596 --> 01:41:18,430
Okay.

1765
01:41:18,514 --> 01:41:21,934
All right.
I have a very serious question to ask you.

1766
01:41:23,060 --> 01:41:26,438
What are your favorite flavors
of ice cream?

1767
01:41:26,939 --> 01:41:28,273
Hmm.

1768
01:41:28,357 --> 01:41:29,692
Strawberry.

1769
01:41:29,775 --> 01:41:30,859
I like strawberry.

1770
01:41:30,943 --> 01:41:32,277
Vanilla.

1771
01:41:33,070 --> 01:41:34,655
Coffee.

1772
01:41:34,738 --> 01:41:35,864
Hold up. Coffee?

1773
01:41:36,657 --> 01:41:39,994
Seriously?
You actually like coffee ice cream?

1774
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:42,120
Huh.

1775
01:41:42,496 --> 01:41:45,249
You don't like actual coffee, do you?

1776
01:41:45,332 --> 01:41:46,750
No, that's gross.

1777
01:41:46,834 --> 01:41:48,752
Okay. Good. Yes, that's gross.

1778
01:41:48,836 --> 01:41:51,922
If he is giving you coffee,
will you text me?

1779
01:41:53,924 --> 01:41:54,924
Deal.

1780
01:41:55,551 --> 01:41:58,804
Baby. Hmm.

1781
01:41:59,888 --> 01:42:00,888
All right.

1782
01:42:01,223 --> 01:42:03,809
Have we left him waiting long enough?

1783
01:42:03,892 --> 01:42:04,892
Eh.

1784
01:42:06,937 --> 01:42:07,938
I guess.

1785
01:42:08,022 --> 01:42:09,314
Girl, I guess too.

1786
01:42:10,149 --> 01:42:11,149
Come on.

1787
01:42:12,901 --> 01:42:15,696
Maddy and I
are gonna go get some ice cream.

1788
01:42:17,239 --> 01:42:18,240
You wanna third wheel?

1789
01:42:21,785 --> 01:42:23,162
I mean, yes.

1790
01:42:24,538 --> 01:42:25,538
Yes, I would.

1791
01:42:31,503 --> 01:42:33,505
- Oh.
- Is that your ice cream dance?

1792
01:43:13,837 --> 01:43:17,299
- Are you sure you're okay with this?
- I'm okay. I'm not afraid.

1793
01:43:17,382 --> 01:43:18,550
All right.

1794
01:43:18,634 --> 01:43:20,274
It's only for the rest of the year, okay?

1795
01:43:20,844 --> 01:43:23,430
So if you don't like it,
then we gonna find somethin' else.

1796
01:43:23,514 --> 01:43:25,194
But if you're not afraid, then guess what?

1797
01:43:25,682 --> 01:43:28,102
I'm not either.

1798
01:43:29,061 --> 01:43:30,145
Hello, Mr. Logelin.

1799
01:43:30,229 --> 01:43:32,106
Welcome back, Maddy.

1800
01:43:32,189 --> 01:43:34,483
Interesting choice of outfit today, sir.

1801
01:43:34,566 --> 01:43:37,903
I'm wearing my uniform,
and Maddy is wearing pants.

1802
01:43:38,654 --> 01:43:42,074
You look very nice today, Maddy.
And we're changing our dress code.

1803
01:43:42,157 --> 01:43:43,909
- Thank you.
- Go to school.

1804
01:43:50,833 --> 01:43:51,833
Hey, Maddy.

1805
01:43:53,585 --> 01:43:54,962
I love you this much.

1806
01:43:55,546 --> 01:43:58,382
Hey, hey.

1807
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:03,137
I don't know how to do the dance.

1808
01:44:03,220 --> 01:44:05,389
Uh. Good day.
