The way he watches you,

177
00:13:19,404 --> 00:13:23,033
it's like he's willing to leap in front of you
and take a bullet or something.

178
00:13:23,675 --> 00:13:25,472
BELLA: Is that a bad thing?

179
00:13:26,177 --> 00:13:27,542
RENEE: It's an intense thing.

180
00:13:28,713 --> 00:13:30,772
You're different with him.

181
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,343
He moves, you move.

182
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:35,511
Like magnets.

183
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:38,720
BELLA: I don't know, we're just...

184
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,657
RENEE: In love. I get it.

185
00:13:42,995 --> 00:13:46,954
I just want to make sure
you're making the right choices for you.

186
00:13:47,266 --> 00:13:49,700
You know, 'cause you're the one
that's gonna have to live with them.

187
00:13:53,706 --> 00:13:56,368
All right, enough with the heavy.

188
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:04,541
BELLA: Mom.

189
00:14:04,617 --> 00:14:06,448
RENEE: Congraduation.

190
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:08,282
BELLA: I didn't want you
to spend any of your money.

191
00:14:08,354 --> 00:14:10,117
RENEE: I didn't, come on.

192
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,058
(BOTH LAUGHING)

193
00:14:23,603 --> 00:14:25,798
- BELLA: Are these all our old trip T-shirts?
- Mmm-hmm.

194
00:14:25,872 --> 00:14:28,272
- BELLA: Get out!
- I saved them all.

195
00:14:28,341 --> 00:14:31,367
RENEE: I thought they'd make a good quilt,
keep you warm up in Alaska.

196
00:14:32,979 --> 00:14:35,413
Remember this one? Ensenada.

197
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,051
- The Snake Pit.
- Yeah.

198
00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:41,481
But this one is my favorite, here.

199
00:14:41,555 --> 00:14:43,614
The three-headed lobster from Maine.

200
00:14:43,957 --> 00:14:46,687
- This is amazing.
- Honey, I'm glad you like it.

201
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,250
I just figured, you know,
when you get older,

202
00:14:48,328 --> 00:14:49,625
have kids, we can add to it.

203
00:14:49,696 --> 00:14:52,563
Maybe go visit the world's largest
ketchup bottle or something.

204
00:14:52,632 --> 00:14:53,929
Thanks.

205
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,335
I'm glad you like it.

206
00:14:58,872 --> 00:15:02,309
Just thought you should have
a little piece of me up there in Alaska.

207
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,710
- Mom...
- Yeah?

208
00:15:10,486 --> 00:15:11,953
I miss you.

209
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,922
Honey, I miss you, too.

210
00:15:33,142 --> 00:15:35,042
Are you sure this is where you saw her?

211
00:15:36,211 --> 00:15:37,974
She's almost here.

212
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:51,981
On your left!

213
00:16:13,582 --> 00:16:14,776
(GRUNTING)

214
00:16:28,096 --> 00:16:29,188
Wait!

215
00:16:29,464 --> 00:16:30,761
She's in their territory.

216
00:16:32,634 --> 00:16:33,896
She'll get away!

217
00:16:35,604 --> 00:16:37,162
No, she won't!

218
00:17:12,775 --> 00:17:13,833
ESME: Emmett, no!

219
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:17,907
(GRUNTING)

220
00:17:20,149 --> 00:17:21,582
(GROWLING)

221
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:48,637
Do you regret going?

222
00:17:50,848 --> 00:17:51,906
No.

223
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:55,848
It was really great seeing my mom.

224
00:17:56,253 --> 00:17:58,687
Just really hard saying goodbye.

225
00:17:59,023 --> 00:18:01,150
It doesn't have to be goodbye.

226
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:03,352
Is that why you asked me to go?

227
00:18:03,494 --> 00:18:06,327
You thought I was gonna change my mind?

228
00:18:07,031 --> 00:18:09,226
I'm always hoping for that.

229
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:12,028
What?

230
00:18:13,537 --> 00:18:16,370
If I asked you to stay in the car, would you?

231
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,045
Of course not.

232
00:18:36,561 --> 00:18:37,755
Hey.

233
00:18:38,963 --> 00:18:40,362
Charlie said you left town.

234
00:18:40,598 --> 00:18:42,828
Yeah. To visit my mom. Why?

235
00:18:43,802 --> 00:18:46,532
He's checking to see if you're still human.

236
00:18:47,472 --> 00:18:48,734
Look, I'm here to warn you.

237
00:18:49,941 --> 00:18:51,602
If your kind come on our land again...

238
00:18:52,377 --> 00:18:53,401
Wait, what?

239
00:18:56,247 --> 00:18:57,271
You didn't tell her?

240
00:18:57,682 --> 00:18:58,876
Just leave it alone, Jacob.

241
00:19:00,985 --> 00:19:01,974
Tell me what?

242
00:19:03,088 --> 00:19:06,057
Emmett and Paul had a misunderstanding.

243
00:19:06,324 --> 00:19:08,087
It's nothing to worry about.

244
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,490
JACOB: Listen to you.

245
00:19:09,994 --> 00:19:11,689
Did you lie to get her out of town, too?

246
00:19:11,763 --> 00:19:13,492
You should just leave.

247
00:19:14,065 --> 00:19:15,090
Now.

248
00:19:15,902 --> 00:19:17,995
She has a right to know.

249
00:19:18,672 --> 00:19:20,230
She is the one the redhead wants.

250
00:19:22,376 --> 00:19:23,434
Victoria?

251
00:19:25,245 --> 00:19:26,872
Alice's vision.

252
00:19:27,914 --> 00:19:29,939
I was trying to protect you.

253
00:19:30,283 --> 00:19:31,944
By lying to me.

254
00:19:35,055 --> 00:19:37,717
Okay, we're gonna talk about this, but...

255
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:38,917
You.

256
00:19:39,593 --> 00:19:41,959
Why haven't you called me back?

257
00:19:44,531 --> 00:19:46,465
I had nothing to say.

258
00:19:48,735 --> 00:19:51,226
- Well, I have tons. Hold on.
- Hey.

259
00:19:53,206 --> 00:19:54,537
Bella.

260
00:19:54,908 --> 00:19:56,535
Edward, you have to trust me.

261
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,202
I do trust you.

262
00:19:58,879 --> 00:20:00,244
It's him I don't trust.

263
00:20:12,025 --> 00:20:14,858
Hey, lose the grin, Jacob.
We're just going for a ride.

264
00:20:14,928 --> 00:20:15,952
Hold on tight.

265
00:20:19,099 --> 00:20:20,930
(JONATHAN LOW PLAYING)

266
00:20:21,034 --> 00:20:24,094
Last born of the clan

267
00:20:24,171 --> 00:20:27,299
First one to be free

268
00:20:27,374 --> 00:20:30,366
Lived inside a house

269
00:20:30,444 --> 00:20:32,605
Are you sure this is a good idea?

270
00:20:34,681 --> 00:20:36,649
I am the vampire girl, remember?

271
00:20:37,818 --> 00:20:39,217
Hey, look who's back!

272
00:20:39,453 --> 00:20:40,442
What up, Bella?

273
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,181
- Quil? You, too?
- Yep.

274
00:20:42,522 --> 00:20:43,682
Finally made the pack.

275
00:20:44,257 --> 00:20:45,281
EMBRY: I'm glad you're here, Bella.

276
00:20:45,358 --> 00:20:48,020
Maybe we can get a break
from Jake's obsessive inner monologue.

277
00:20:48,094 --> 00:20:49,186
"I wish Bella would call."

278
00:20:49,663 --> 00:20:50,994
"I wish Bella wouldn't call."

279
00:20:51,064 --> 00:20:53,863
- "Maybe I should call Bella."
- "Maybe I should call Bella and hang up."

280
00:20:53,935 --> 00:20:55,129
(ALL LAUGHING)

281
00:20:55,203 --> 00:20:57,330
All right, you can shut up now.

282
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:03,735
Bella, this is Leah Clearwater,
Harry's daughter.

283
00:21:04,312 --> 00:21:07,338
Hey. I'm really sorry about your father.

284
00:21:07,782 --> 00:21:10,148
If you're here to torture Jacob some more,
feel free to leave.

285
00:21:13,921 --> 00:21:15,047
Fun, isn't she?

286
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,884
- Bella, hi!
- Hey.

287
00:21:19,193 --> 00:21:22,060
I was wondering
when we'd see your face around here again.

288
00:21:22,129 --> 00:21:23,494
BELLA: Yeah. Same here.

289
00:21:23,664 --> 00:21:24,653
Sam, we good?

290
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:28,393
We're good. She won't be getting
through our line any time soon.

291
00:21:28,469 --> 00:21:30,460
- Cool.
- Yeah, that's right boys!

292
00:21:39,747 --> 00:21:42,080
So when did Leah join the pack?

293
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:46,214
Around when her dad died.
Her brother, Seth, also phased.

294
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:50,320
He's only 15,
one of the youngest we've had.

295
00:21:51,193 --> 00:21:54,526
Sam keeps him home studying,
but he's chomping at the bit.

296
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,127
I wish it was Leah who'd stay home.

297
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,528
Come on, don't be such a guy.

298
00:22:00,602 --> 00:22:03,070
No, it's not a chick thing.

299
00:22:03,472 --> 00:22:06,236
It's, you know, a triangle thing.

300
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:10,470
We all have to live
the LeahlSamlEmily pain-fest.

301
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,245
Wolf telepathy, remember?

302
00:22:13,949 --> 00:22:16,076
So Sam dumps Leah for Emily?

303
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:20,620
Yeah, it wasn't like that.
Sam hates himself for hurting Leah.

304
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,949
But Emily was the one.

305
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,058
I guess it sort of chooses you sometimes.

306
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,033
It's more than some crush, Bella.

307
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,262
Sam imprinted on Emily.

308
00:22:36,172 --> 00:22:38,367
Do I even want to know what that is?

309
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:50,212
Imprinting on someone is like...

310
00:22:52,589 --> 00:22:54,648
Like when you see her,

311
00:22:55,925 --> 00:22:57,722
everything changes.

312
00:22:59,228 --> 00:23:03,028
All of a sudden,
it's not gravity holding you to the planet.

313
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:05,430
It's her.

314
00:23:06,336 --> 00:23:08,201
Nothing else matters.

315
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:11,464
You would do anything,

316
00:23:13,076 --> 00:23:14,805
be anything for her.

317
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:20,079
Sounds like you know the feeling.

318
00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:25,252
Have you

319
00:23:27,358 --> 00:23:29,326
imprinted on someone?

320
00:23:34,432 --> 00:23:35,922
You'd know if I had.

321
00:23:40,105 --> 00:23:43,131
I just have a direct line to Sam's thoughts.

322
00:23:44,943 --> 00:23:46,672
So for now you're

323
00:23:47,212 --> 00:23:48,474
still you.

324
00:23:51,116 --> 00:23:53,141
And you're still you.

325
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,479
Yeah.

326
00:24:01,026 --> 00:24:02,323
Until graduation.

327
00:24:04,129 --> 00:24:05,460
Graduation?

328
00:24:07,098 --> 00:24:08,828
You knew this was gonna happen.

329
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:09,993
Not in a month!

330
00:24:12,505 --> 00:24:16,440
I mean, not before you've...
You've even lived.

331
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:19,501
Or before I could...

332
00:24:19,944 --> 00:24:20,933
(CRASHING)

333
00:24:23,415 --> 00:24:27,146
For a second, just a second, I thought...

334
00:24:29,154 --> 00:24:31,384
But he's got his hooks in you so deep...

335
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,855
I decided this, not him.

336
00:24:34,926 --> 00:24:37,292
Bella, they're not even alive.

337
00:24:38,296 --> 00:24:39,854
It makes me sick.

338
00:24:42,534 --> 00:24:45,332
Better you really be dead than one of them.

339
00:24:58,651 --> 00:25:00,084
I can't believe you said that.

340
00:25:04,757 --> 00:25:06,987
Edward was right, I shouldn't have come.

341
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:09,960
Bella, come on. Please.

342
00:25:13,099 --> 00:25:14,293
I'm sorry.

343
00:26:24,037 --> 00:26:28,337
You know, Edward could
at least respect meal times.

344
00:26:29,142 --> 00:26:30,404
I was just with Jake.

345
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:32,267
Oh.

346
00:26:33,547 --> 00:26:34,845
Good.

347
00:26:35,116 --> 00:26:36,208
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

348
00:26:39,453 --> 00:26:42,786
I'll just give you two some privacy, then.

349
00:26:45,126 --> 00:26:47,094
- Hey.
- Do you understand how worried I've been?

350
00:26:47,495 --> 00:26:48,928
I was perfectly safe.

351
00:26:48,996 --> 00:26:51,157
I almost broke the treaty to make sure.

352
00:26:52,233 --> 00:26:55,327
- I know I smell like a dog. I'm sorry.
- No, something's wrong.

353
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,171
Edward, what's wrong?

354

DR. CULLEN: Who was it?
Someone we know?

356
00:27:14,856 --> 00:27:17,950
This stranger, I didn't recognize his scent.

357
00:27:18,025 --> 00:27:19,686
A nomad passing through?

358
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,728
A passerby wouldn't
have left Bella's father alive.

359
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:26,133
The scent disappeared
about 5 miles south of Bella's house.

360
00:27:27,002 --> 00:27:28,902
Someone's orchestrating this.

361
00:27:28,971 --> 00:27:30,336
Victoria?

362
00:27:31,006 --> 00:27:32,564
I would have seen her decide.

363
00:27:32,808 --> 00:27:33,900
Has to be the Volturi.

364
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:37,238
I don't think it's the Volturi, either.

365
00:27:37,312 --> 00:27:39,075
I've been watching Aro's decisions, too.

guarding Bella at her house.

00:27:47,757 --> 00:27:48,746
No, she's right.

371
00:27:49,225 --> 00:27:53,662
You can't protect me, watch my dad
and search for the intruder.

372
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,493

387
00:28:39,475 --> 00:28:42,171
but it wasn't about rivalry anymore.

388
00:28:42,879 --> 00:28:45,609
It was about my safety, and Charlie's.

I got them to at least try to work together.

I mean, they thought it would
be good for you to hear the histories.

to the powerful wolf.

and protect our tribe.

432

and I wouldn't smell the same.

532
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:33,530
My Bella, just less fragile.

533

a big graduation party.

Which you're invited to.

536
00:40:02,205 --> 00:40:04,867
Yeah, I figured that.

537
00:40:12,615 --> 00:40:13,775
What?

538
00:40:15,752 --> 00:40:18,277
I just wanted to do this differently.

539
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,019
Smoother.

540
00:40:21,591 --> 00:40:23,525
But now I'm out of time.

541
00:40:24,862 --> 00:40:26,159
Do what?

542
00:40:27,031 --> 00:40:29,659
You need to hear the truth, Bella,

543
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,632
understand all your options.

544
00:40:34,205 --> 00:40:35,968
And you need to know

545
00:40:37,542 --> 00:40:39,772
that I'm in love with you,

546
00:40:41,246 --> 00:40:44,272

instead of him.

- I don't feel that way for you.
- I don't buy it.

549

550

That's how I feel.

551

You feel something else for me.
You just won't admit it.

552

553

555
00:41:15,046 --> 00:41:16,775
Well, then you're not gonna
have to fight for long.

You're rushing into it because
you're afraid you'll change your mind.

No, I'm not.

558

I know what I want.

559
00:41:25,457 --> 00:41:28,483
You wouldn't have to change for me, Bella,

560
00:41:29,194 --> 00:41:31,389
or say goodbye to anybody.

561
00:41:32,464 --> 00:41:35,024
I can give you more than him.

562
00:41:36,034 --> 00:41:40,266
I mean, he probably can't even kiss you
without hurting you.

00:41:41,706 --> 00:41:43,071

- That's ridiculous.
- No, it's not.

You have a choice.

603
00:44:21,168 --> 00:44:22,635
I didn't.

604

But you do, and you're choosing wrong.

00:51:49,093 --> 00:51:51,584
Hey. What did you think of my speech?

711
00:51:51,662 --> 00:51:54,631
Too easy-breezy? Too self-helpful?
You hated it?

712
00:51:54,698 --> 00:51:57,292
- No. I think you pretty much nailed it.
- JESSICA: Yeah?

713

You invited me, remember?

718
00:52:31,101 --> 00:52:35,037
Was my right hook too subtle for you?
That was me uninviting you.

719
00:52:35,873 --> 00:52:39,435
Look, Bella, I'm sorry about, you know,

720
00:52:40,979 --> 00:52:43,447
the kiss and your hand.

I'm really sorry.

I know his face. He's local. Riley Biers.

741
00:53:52,685 --> 00:53:53,709
He didn't start this.

742

Whoever did is staying out of the action.

743

Newborns won't know they even exist.
That'll give us an edge.

- Carlisle, they're gonna get hurt.
- We'll all need some training.

that Jasper has.

Welcome.

782
00:56:41,456 --> 00:56:45,257
Jasper has experience with newborns.
He'll teach us how to defeat them.

783
00:56:48,698 --> 00:56:50,359
They want to know
how the newborns differ from us.

784
00:56:51,868 --> 00:56:53,460
They're a great deal stronger than us

785
00:56:53,536 --> 00:56:56,403
because their own human blood
lingers in their tissues.

786
00:56:57,173 --> 00:57:00,267
Our kind is never more physically powerful

787
00:57:00,743 --> 00:57:02,938
than in our first several months of this life.

788
00:57:06,482 --> 00:57:10,282
Carlisle's right. That's why they are created.

789
00:57:11,654 --> 00:57:15,556
A newborn army doesn't need thousands
like a human army,

790
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:18,753
but no human army
could stand against them.

791
00:57:20,396 --> 00:57:23,490
Now, the two most important things
to remember are, first,

792
00:57:23,566 --> 00:57:27,002
never let them get their arms around you.
They'll crush you instantly.

793
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:28,628
And second,

794
00:57:29,872 --> 00:57:32,637
never go for the obvious kill.

795
00:57:34,144 --> 00:57:36,375
They'll be expecting that,

796
00:57:36,981 --> 00:57:39,245
and you will lose.

- Not in my nature.

00:58:06,844 --> 00:58:08,505
Never lose focus.

Some of you could get killed
because of me.

Are you sure
there's nothing I can do to help?

823
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:24,207
Well, your presence alone, your scent,
will distract the newborns.

824
01:00:24,284 --> 01:00:28,311
Their hunting instinct will take over
and drive them crazy.

825
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:31,916
Good. I'm glad.

826
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:37,427
Hey. How do you know so much about this?

827
01:00:39,432 --> 01:00:43,493
I didn't have quite the same upbringing
as my adopted siblings.

828
01:00:49,877 --> 01:00:53,142
- Those bites are like mine.
- Battle scars.

829
01:00:55,483 --> 01:00:58,145
All the training
the Confederate Army gave me

830
01:00:58,219 --> 01:01:00,687
was useless against the newborns.

831
01:01:01,455 --> 01:01:04,288
Still, I never lost a fight.

832
01:01:10,197 --> 01:01:13,223
This happened during the Civil War?

833
01:01:13,301 --> 01:01:16,031
I was the youngest major
in the Texas cavalry,

834
01:01:16,103 --> 01:01:18,799
all without having seen any real battle.

of women and children

841

I immediately offered them my aid.

842
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:50,638
Lovely. And an officer.

You'd better do it, Maria.
I can never stop once I've started.

845

- What's your name, soldier?
- Major Jasper Whitlock, ma'am.

I hope you survive.

You may be of great use to me.

848
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:23,901
- Maria was creating an army?
- They were very common in the South.

849
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:29,472
There were constant brutal battles
for territory.

850
01:02:30,113 --> 01:02:31,842
Maria won them all.

851
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:37,679
She was smart, careful, and she had me.

I was her second in command.

854

My ability to control emotions
served her well.

01:06:13,174 --> 01:06:16,871
I'm not just gonna hide
while you're out taking all the risks for me.

886
01:06:17,678 --> 01:06:21,079
If it's Victoria involved, I need to keep you
as far away from the fight as possible.

887
01:06:21,148 --> 01:06:24,606
- Jasper said that I could be of help.
- We won't need your help.

888
01:06:24,685 --> 01:06:27,518
With the wolves in this, it's an easy win.

889
01:06:27,588 --> 01:06:30,216
The rest of us
aren't gonna have enough to do.

890
01:06:30,291 --> 01:06:32,657
Okay.
Either it's so dangerous that I have to hide

891
01:06:32,727 --> 01:06:34,752
or it's so easy
that you're gonna be sidelined. Which is it?

892
01:06:34,829 --> 01:06:37,320
It's dangerous for you, it's easy for us.

893
01:06:39,267 --> 01:06:43,931
I think it's dangerous for us to be apart.
How many times do we have to prove that?

894
01:06:44,972 --> 01:06:49,705
I'll be worried. You'll be worried.
And we'll both be more vulnerable.

895
01:06:52,313 --> 01:06:54,042
Okay, you're right.

896
01:06:54,749 --> 01:06:58,310
- So I'm coming with you.
- No, we both stay away together.

897
01:06:58,753 --> 01:07:01,620
I can't make you choose
between me and your family.

898
01:07:01,689 --> 01:07:04,715
The only way I can protect you
is to be with you.

899
01:07:08,929 --> 01:07:12,990
You're not fighting?
What, did you pull a muscle or something?

900
01:07:13,067 --> 01:07:15,467
- He's doing it for me, okay?
- Whatever.

901
01:07:16,837 --> 01:07:18,066
Just tell me the plan.

902
01:07:19,007 --> 01:07:20,975
This field will give us
an advantage in battle.

903
01:07:21,043 --> 01:07:23,841
We need to lure the newborns
with Bella's scent,

904
01:07:24,579 --> 01:07:26,342
but it needs to end here.

905
01:07:26,415 --> 01:07:28,042
Edward and I are going to a campsite.

906
01:07:28,116 --> 01:07:31,449
Even if he carries me,
they'll still pick up on our scents.

907
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,488
Your stench, however, is revolting.

908
01:07:33,555 --> 01:07:35,682
Dude, you really
don't wanna start comparing stinks.

909
01:07:35,757 --> 01:07:39,352
What he means is that your scent
will mask mine if you carry me.

910
01:07:40,228 --> 01:07:43,254
- Done.
- This is not a good idea.

911
01:07:43,332 --> 01:07:48,326
Edward, they won't want
to get anywhere near his odor.

912
01:07:48,603 --> 01:07:50,594
Okay. Let's just try it.

913
01:07:53,375 --> 01:07:55,741
- Eau de wolf coming up.
- Run.

914
01:08:06,054 --> 01:08:08,615
So you gonna ask me
to sit out of the fight, too?

915
01:08:08,691 --> 01:08:10,818
Or don't you care about my safety?

916
01:08:11,294 --> 01:08:16,732
- Of course, I care. But you'd say no.
- I won't have a choice, anyways.

917
01:08:17,967 --> 01:08:22,267
Since I let Sam be alpha male,
I gotta live with the shots he calls.

918
01:08:23,506 --> 01:08:25,406
Since you let Sam be alpha?

919
01:08:26,676 --> 01:08:30,476
I didn't wanna be in a pack,
let alone be its leader.

920
01:08:32,348 --> 01:08:33,440
Wow.

921
01:08:34,951 --> 01:08:37,920
- Chief Jacob.
- Opted out.

922
01:08:39,055 --> 01:08:41,353
But every choice has its consequences.

923
01:08:41,924 --> 01:08:44,484
- Some more than others.
- Don't start.

924
01:08:44,994 --> 01:08:47,963
Everybody makes choices.
You're gonna have to accept mine.

925
01:08:48,030 --> 01:08:51,431
But you can love
more than one person at a time.

926
01:08:51,501 --> 01:08:55,130
I've seen it. With Sam, Emily and Leah.

927
01:08:56,673 --> 01:09:01,610
- Well, I'm not a wolf. I can't imprint.
- It has nothing to do with imprinting.

928
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:06,409
It has to do with feeling something
for somebody.

929
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:09,678
And I know you feel something for me.

930
01:09:10,888 --> 01:09:14,016
I can sense how I make you feel, physically.

931
01:09:15,893 --> 01:09:17,656
I make you nervous.

932
01:09:21,965 --> 01:09:23,193
Jake.

933
01:09:25,269 --> 01:09:26,702
Don't worry.

934
01:09:27,638 --> 01:09:31,005
I promised I wouldn't kiss you again
till you asked.

935
01:09:31,642 --> 01:09:35,237
You're gonna be keeping that promise
for a while, chief.

936
01:09:38,248 --> 01:09:41,775
All I picked up was wolf stench. No Bella.

937
01:09:45,023 --> 01:09:47,457
- This will work.
- Great.

938
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:53,988
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

939
01:09:55,533 --> 01:09:57,228
Yes. Scout's honor.

940
01:09:58,002 --> 01:10:00,903
- Okay, Alice, don't be a stranger.
- Okay.

941
01:10:02,607 --> 01:10:05,599
- Your alibi for the battle is all arranged.
- Really?

942
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:08,806
I told your father that our whole family's
going camping this weekend,

943
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,314
so you and I are having a sleepover
at my house.

944
01:10:12,584 --> 01:10:15,417
- Charlie's going fishing, anyway.
- Charlie?

945
01:10:15,954 --> 01:10:19,390
- You guys are on first name basis now?
- Me, he likes.

946
01:10:20,959 --> 01:10:24,191
Actually, you and Edward
will have the house to yourself tonight.

947
01:10:27,766 --> 01:10:28,824
Like alone?

948
01:10:29,602 --> 01:10:33,095
We're all going hunting.
Powering up for the battle.

949
01:10:35,842 --> 01:10:36,934
You're welcome.

950
01:10:39,145 --> 01:10:42,910
- Hey. You want a sandwich?
- No, I'm good.

951
01:10:44,984 --> 01:10:46,975
Well, the sister, I like.

952
01:10:48,153 --> 01:10:51,054
Alice. Yeah, she's great.

953
01:10:59,031 --> 01:11:00,999
Hey, Dad, I was wondering.

954
01:11:02,535 --> 01:11:05,595
Why didn't you get remarried? After Mom.

955
01:11:10,042 --> 01:11:14,775
I don't know.
Guess I still haven't met the right gal.

956
01:11:17,182 --> 01:11:19,275
- Why?
- I don't know.

957
01:11:22,589 --> 01:11:26,616
I thought you just maybe gave up
on the whole institution of it,

958
01:11:27,761 --> 01:11:29,194
of marriage.

959
01:11:30,997 --> 01:11:32,624
But do you think there's any value in it?

960
01:11:34,901 --> 01:11:37,927
Yeah. Yeah, marriage has value.

961
01:11:40,006 --> 01:11:41,598
When you're older.

962
01:11:42,609 --> 01:11:43,871
Much older.

963
01:11:46,079 --> 01:11:47,671
Like your mother.

964
01:11:48,081 --> 01:11:50,481
It seemed to work out fine for her
the second time around,

965
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:53,451
- later in life.
- Yeah, I guess.

966
01:11:56,056 --> 01:12:00,390
I mean, you definitely don't wanna
have to get married because you weren't

967
01:12:01,461 --> 01:12:02,860
careful.

968
01:12:04,831 --> 01:12:08,267
- What?
- Look, you know what I'm talking about.

969
01:12:09,669 --> 01:12:12,901
There's things you need to think about
if you're gonna be physically intimate.

970
01:12:12,974 --> 01:12:15,568
Okay. Don't have "the talk" with me, please.

971
01:12:15,643 --> 01:12:18,203
Well, it's just as embarrassing for me
as it is for you.

972
01:12:18,279 --> 01:12:19,644
I doubt that.

973
01:12:19,714 --> 01:12:22,148
And don't bother,
'cause Mom beat you to it like 10 years ago.

974
01:12:22,216 --> 01:12:24,116
Well, you didn't have a boyfriend
10 years ago.

975
01:12:24,185 --> 01:12:26,585
I'm sure things work the same way.

976
01:12:28,923 --> 01:12:30,618
All right, so...

977
01:12:32,526 --> 01:12:34,960
You guys are taking precautions and...

978
01:12:35,029 --> 01:12:37,998
Okay, Dad, please,
just don't worry about that.

979
01:12:39,066 --> 01:12:42,092
Edward is old school.

980
01:12:44,438 --> 01:12:48,033
Old school. Great. What's that?
Like, code for something?

981
01:12:48,109 --> 01:12:50,771
Oh, my God. Dad. I'm a virgin.

982
01:12:51,779 --> 01:12:55,340
- Okay! Good. Glad we covered that.
- Me, too.

983
01:12:59,888 --> 01:13:01,219
Virgin.

984
01:13:02,824 --> 01:13:05,122
I'm liking Edward a little bit more now.

985
01:13:16,004 --> 01:13:18,234
What are you doing outside?
What's wrong?

986
01:13:19,508 --> 01:13:20,736
Nothing.

987
01:13:40,529 --> 01:13:43,327
It seems only fair
that I be represented, as well.

988
01:13:47,936 --> 01:13:49,768
It's really pretty.

989
01:13:50,973 --> 01:13:52,031
Thanks.

990
01:14:00,416 --> 01:14:01,906
There's a bed.

991
01:14:03,219 --> 01:14:05,653
I thought you might need one to sleep in.

992
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:10,584
I think an air mattress would have sufficed.

993
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:13,561
- Is this too much?
- No.

994
01:14:14,731 --> 01:14:16,426
No, it's perfect.

995
01:14:18,034 --> 01:14:21,470
- I wanna ask you something.
- Anything.

996
01:14:25,708 --> 01:14:29,041
Okay, marriage is the condition for you
to change me yourself, right?

997
01:14:31,948 --> 01:14:33,040
Yes.

998
01:14:36,018 --> 01:14:39,080
Okay. I wanna negotiate my own condition.

999
01:14:41,192 --> 01:14:43,524
Anything you want. It's yours.

1000
01:14:45,563 --> 01:14:47,190
You promise?

1001
01:14:48,633 --> 01:14:49,827
Yeah.

1002
01:14:53,838 --> 01:14:55,169
Okay.

1003
01:15:01,712 --> 01:15:02,770
Hey.

1004
01:15:11,588 --> 01:15:12,885
Bella.

1005
01:15:13,957 --> 01:15:15,151
No.

1006
01:15:15,225 --> 01:15:17,523
But you said that you wanted me
to have every human experience.

1007
01:15:17,594 --> 01:15:20,757
- Not ones that will risk killing you.
- You won't.

1008
01:15:22,966 --> 01:15:26,060
And everyone says once I'm changed
all I'll want is to slaughter the whole town.

1009
01:15:27,438 --> 01:15:30,532
- That part doesn't last forever.
- I want you.

1010
01:15:32,944 --> 01:15:37,176
While I'm still me.
While I still want you this way.

1011
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:46,914
- It's too dangerous.
- Try. Just try.

1012
01:15:49,794 --> 01:15:54,197
I'll go to some ridiculously expensive
college and let you buy me a car.

1013
01:15:54,265 --> 01:15:56,495
I'll marry you. Just try.

1014
01:15:57,035 --> 01:15:59,367
(MY LOVE PLAYING)

1015
01:15:59,804 --> 01:16:02,705
You were searching

1016
01:16:03,608 --> 01:16:07,442
For release

1017
01:16:08,146 --> 01:16:11,582
You took my hand

1018
01:16:11,983 --> 01:16:15,647
Added a plan

1019
01:16:15,721 --> 01:16:19,885
You gave me your heart

1020
01:16:26,799 --> 01:16:33,728
I know you're pleased to go

1021
01:16:37,877 --> 01:16:40,368
Stop trying to take your clothes off.

1022
01:16:40,446 --> 01:16:43,108
- You wanna do that part?
- Not tonight.

1023
01:17:03,502 --> 01:17:04,663
You...

1024
01:17:08,174 --> 01:17:10,108
You mean, you don't...

1025
01:17:12,078 --> 01:17:13,170
(SIGHING) That's fine.

1026
01:17:16,583 --> 01:17:18,710
Believe me, I want to.

1027
01:17:20,887 --> 01:17:22,821
I just want to be married to you first.

1028
01:17:26,192 --> 01:17:28,490
You really make me feel
like I'm some sort of villain

1029
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:31,655
trying to steal your virtue or something.

1030
01:17:34,067 --> 01:17:36,262
It's not my virtue I'm concerned about.

1031
01:17:38,672 --> 01:17:40,333
Are you kidding?

1032
01:17:40,907 --> 01:17:44,934
It's just one rule I wanna leave unbroken.

1033
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:51,011
It might be too late for my soul,
but I will protect yours.

1034
01:17:52,185 --> 01:17:54,882
I know that's not a modern notion.

1035
01:17:54,956 --> 01:17:58,119
It's not modern. It's ancient.

1036
01:18:01,228 --> 01:18:03,287
I'm from a different era.

1037
01:18:05,633 --> 01:18:09,160
Things were a lot less complicated.

1038
01:18:11,405 --> 01:18:15,865
And if I'd have met you back then,
I would have courted you.

1039
01:18:18,079 --> 01:18:23,244
We'd have taken chaperoned strolls
and iced tea on the porch.

1040
01:18:34,061 --> 01:18:36,427
I may have stolen a kiss or two,

1041
01:18:37,531 --> 01:18:42,469
but only after asking
your father's permission.

1042
01:18:44,773 --> 01:18:46,331
I would have got down on one knee,

1043
01:18:53,215 --> 01:18:56,185
and I would have
presented you with a ring.

1044
01:19:03,259 --> 01:19:04,351
This was my mother's.

1045
01:19:08,631 --> 01:19:13,590
Isabella Swan, I promise to love you
every moment of forever.

1046
01:19:14,770 --> 01:19:18,433
And would you do me
the extraordinary honor of marrying me?

1047
01:19:24,312 --> 01:19:25,677
Yes.

1048
01:19:47,537 --> 01:19:49,630
You're not coming with us?

1049
01:19:58,214 --> 01:20:00,705
It'll be a last minute decision.

1050
01:20:02,718 --> 01:20:07,951
- I told you how it works.
- The Cullens have powers.

1051
01:20:09,158 --> 01:20:13,857
Don't underestimate them, Riley.
You'll have the numbers,

1052
01:20:14,831 --> 01:20:20,031
but they'll be able
to anticipate your every move.

1053
01:20:21,438 --> 01:20:24,202
- According to your friend?
- Yes.

1054
01:20:24,808 --> 01:20:27,675
My dead friend.

1055
01:20:30,447 --> 01:20:33,712
Laurent found out about the things
they could do,

1056
01:20:35,719 --> 01:20:37,550
and they killed him.

1057
01:20:39,423 --> 01:20:41,618
But not before he told me.

1058
01:20:46,763 --> 01:20:48,594
Maybe he was wrong.

1059
01:20:51,668 --> 01:20:58,164
I mean, this is supposed to be
Cullen territory.

1060
01:20:59,276 --> 01:21:03,212
We've been tearing it up
and I've never even seen them here.

1061
01:21:04,248 --> 01:21:06,011
You don't trust me.

1062
01:21:07,217 --> 01:21:11,746
- With my life. I'm just saying...
- I'm doing this for us.

1063
01:21:11,823 --> 01:21:16,886
So that we can feed
without their retaliation.

1064
01:21:16,961 --> 01:21:20,727
I can't live in fear anymore,
waiting for them to attack.

1065
01:21:20,798 --> 01:21:22,493
I won't let them.

1066
01:21:23,668 --> 01:21:28,435
I am going to end the Cullen clan.

1067
01:21:31,309 --> 01:21:32,708
I swear.

1068
01:21:49,894 --> 01:21:53,227
I love you so much.

1069
01:22:13,852 --> 01:22:15,251
You're going overboard.

1070
01:22:15,854 --> 01:22:18,414
If this is all I can contribute,
I wanna be thorough.

1071
01:22:18,490 --> 01:22:20,720
The newborns'll be frantic.

1072
01:22:22,928 --> 01:22:26,329
It's okay.
Don't make yourself uncomfortable.

1073
01:22:26,398 --> 01:22:27,729
It doesn't bother me anymore.

1074
01:22:29,835 --> 01:22:31,029
Since when?

1075
01:22:31,503 --> 01:22:34,529
Since I spent 24 hours
thinking you were dead.

1076
01:22:36,175 --> 01:22:38,405
You're not wearing your ring.

1077
01:22:39,912 --> 01:22:42,278
Well, I didn't want to risk losing it.

1078
01:22:44,149 --> 01:22:45,639
Or risk Jacob seeing it.

1079
01:22:48,888 --> 01:22:52,790
I think we should wait to tell him.
I mean, at least till after the fight.

1080
01:22:52,859 --> 01:22:55,487
- If you're having second thoughts...
- I'm not.

1081
01:22:55,562 --> 01:22:59,658
- I just want him to have a clear head.
- Whose head is unclear?

1082
01:23:01,201 --> 01:23:02,896
Nobody's I hope.

1083
01:23:03,903 --> 01:23:06,872
- Alice says there's a storm coming.
- Yeah, I can feel it.

1084
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:09,906
We should get going.

1085
01:23:11,045 --> 01:23:13,513
I'll see you in a couple of hours.

1086
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:24,256
Something up?

1087
01:23:27,193 --> 01:23:30,890
- Bunch of vampires trying to kill me.
- Same old same old.

1088
01:24:48,877 --> 01:24:49,969
Thank you.

1089
01:24:52,547 --> 01:24:55,607
- You should get back before the storm hits.
- No, I'm staying.

1090
01:24:56,351 --> 01:24:59,081
You'll need my connection to the pack
to keep tabs on what's going on.

1091
01:24:59,154 --> 01:25:02,681
- You're not gonna fight?
- Seth will spell me in the morning.

1092
01:25:03,058 --> 01:25:05,993
He's not happy about missing the action
but it'll keep him out of trouble.

1093
01:25:07,763 --> 01:25:09,321
Let's get you inside.

1094
01:25:22,512 --> 01:25:23,945
(WHIMPERING)

1095
01:25:27,517 --> 01:25:32,682
- I should have chosen a site lower down.
- No, it's fine. I'm okay.

1096
01:25:33,356 --> 01:25:34,948
What can I do?

1097
01:25:40,830 --> 01:25:42,297
(WIND HOWLING)

1098
01:25:47,703 --> 01:25:51,002
I can't sleep
with all that teeth chattering going on.

1099
01:25:58,281 --> 01:26:02,514
- Forget it.
- She may need her toes someday.

1100
01:26:03,787 --> 01:26:07,120
And let's face it, I am hotter than you.

1101
01:26:12,196 --> 01:26:17,065
- Get your hand off me.
- Keep your hands off her.

1102
01:26:17,568 --> 01:26:19,058
Don't fight.

1103
01:26:22,439 --> 01:26:24,236
If she gets sick, it's on you.

1104
01:26:41,291 --> 01:26:43,486
Wow, you're freezing, Bella.

1105
01:26:44,595 --> 01:26:48,053
Relax. You'll warm up soon.

1106
01:26:49,633 --> 01:26:52,194
Faster if you took your clothes off.

1107
01:26:52,270 --> 01:26:54,932
- Jake.
- Survival 101.

1108
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:29,870
Can you at least attempt
to control your thoughts?

1109
01:27:32,278 --> 01:27:35,873
I really get under
that ice-cold skin of yours, don't I?

1110
01:27:38,216 --> 01:27:39,343
What?

1111
01:27:40,386 --> 01:27:43,048
Are you doubting her feelings for you?

1112
01:27:45,724 --> 01:27:46,816
Nice.

1113
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:53,296
So picking through my brain's okay,
but letting me into yours, forget it.

1114
01:27:57,303 --> 01:27:58,463
Look.

1115
01:28:00,039 --> 01:28:02,906
- I know she's in love with you.
- Good.

1116
01:28:03,576 --> 01:28:05,908
But she's in love with me, too.

1117
01:28:08,147 --> 01:28:10,672
She just won't admit it to herself.

1118
01:28:13,686 --> 01:28:16,120
I can't tell if you're right.

1119
01:28:17,590 --> 01:28:19,114
Then let me ask you something.

1120
01:28:20,192 --> 01:28:22,922
- If she chooses me...
- She won't.

1121
01:28:23,495 --> 01:28:24,826
If she did,

1122
01:28:26,565 --> 01:28:27,964
would you try to kill me?

1123
01:28:29,603 --> 01:28:31,696
That's an intriguing idea.

1124
01:28:36,610 --> 01:28:39,738
But, no. I couldn't hurt her like that.

1125
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:43,644
So you'd just turn her into
a blood-sucking demon like you?

1126
01:28:44,451 --> 01:28:47,352
I don't want that. I never wanted that.

1127
01:28:47,787 --> 01:28:50,312
- So stop her.
- I tried.

1128
01:28:52,125 --> 01:28:54,855
- I left.
- But you gave up too quickly.

1129
01:28:56,796 --> 01:29:01,699
If you'd stayed away another 6 months,
I could've made her happy.

1130
01:29:02,469 --> 01:29:03,800
Trust me.

1131
01:29:05,305 --> 01:29:10,140
You have to consider
that I might be better for her than you are.

1132
01:29:12,812 --> 01:29:14,746
I have considered that.

1133
01:29:18,452 --> 01:29:20,613
I know you can protect her.

1134
01:29:23,257 --> 01:29:28,092
But you can give her a life, a human life.
That's all I want for her.

1135
01:29:31,265 --> 01:29:32,323
But I'm not...

1136
01:29:33,401 --> 01:29:36,666
I'm not going to force her into anything
ever again.

1137
01:29:39,106 --> 01:29:42,439
The last time I tried,
it almost killed us both.

1138
01:29:44,779 --> 01:29:47,179
Yeah. That I remember.

1139
01:29:51,419 --> 01:29:53,683
When you thought she was gone,

1140
01:29:56,023 --> 01:29:57,786
that you'd lost her,

1141
01:30:00,294 --> 01:30:03,195
how did you cope?

1142
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:06,997
There are no words.

1143
01:30:13,041 --> 01:30:15,475
But I wouldn't wish it on anyone, Jacob.

1144
01:30:18,213 --> 01:30:21,740
This might sound odd,
but I'm glad you're here.

1145
01:30:22,617 --> 01:30:23,914
Meaning,

1146
01:30:24,953 --> 01:30:27,922
"As much as I'd love to kill you,
I'm glad she's warm."

1147
01:30:31,059 --> 01:30:33,357
If we weren't natural enemies

1148
01:30:33,895 --> 01:30:36,830
and you weren't trying to
steal my reason for existing,

1149
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:40,327
I might actually like you.

1150
01:30:41,369 --> 01:30:42,666
Well,

1151
01:30:44,239 --> 01:30:48,437
if you weren't planning on sucking the life
out of the girl I love,

1152
01:30:49,344 --> 01:30:50,675
I might...

1153
01:30:57,754 --> 01:31:00,814
No. Not even then.

1154
01:31:09,165 --> 01:31:12,464
But she could still change her mind,
you know.

1155
01:31:19,242 --> 01:31:20,607
Then I'd let her go.

1156
01:31:40,764 --> 01:31:42,356
Right. Hey, Seth.

1157
01:31:45,570 --> 01:31:48,505
- Where's Jacob? Did he already...
- Not yet.

1158
01:31:50,375 --> 01:31:54,140
He's checking to see if the woods are clear
before he goes.

1159
01:32:01,251 --> 01:32:04,812
I'm really sorry about last night.
That couldn't have been easy on you.

1160
01:32:05,255 --> 01:32:08,247
It definitely won't make my list
of top 10 favorite evenings.

1161
01:32:09,326 --> 01:32:13,456
- You have a list?
- All 10 I spent with you.

1162
01:32:14,898 --> 01:32:19,267
Number one is when you said
you'd marry me, Mrs. Cullen.

1163
01:32:23,106 --> 01:32:27,008
This is the 21st century.
I at least want to hyphenate my name.

1164
01:32:27,845 --> 01:32:31,303
- You're marrying him?
- Jake, I...

1165
01:32:35,687 --> 01:32:39,145
- You knew he was listening!
- He deserves to know.

1166
01:32:40,525 --> 01:32:42,083
- Jake, stop!
- Bella, let him...

1167
01:32:42,193 --> 01:32:43,319
Don't!

1168
01:32:46,397 --> 01:32:47,455
Jake, stop!

1169
01:32:51,135 --> 01:32:54,593
- BELLA: Jake, please!
- I'm done! I'm so done!

1170
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:57,068
What can I do?

1171
01:32:57,141 --> 01:33:01,339
You can't do anything. I can,
by going out there and killing something.

1172
01:33:01,412 --> 01:33:04,006
No! You're not thinking clearly!
Don't do that!

1173
01:33:04,215 --> 01:33:06,877
Maybe I'll get myself killed
and make it simple for you.

1174
01:33:06,951 --> 01:33:09,385
No! Just, Jake, stay.

1175
01:33:11,289 --> 01:33:12,483
Why?

1176
01:33:14,359 --> 01:33:16,054
Give me one good reason.

1177
01:33:17,195 --> 01:33:19,129
Because I don't wanna lose you.

1178
01:33:20,765 --> 01:33:22,131
It's not good enough.

1179
01:33:23,535 --> 01:33:25,400
Because you're too important.

1180
01:33:28,841 --> 01:33:32,333
- Still not good enough.
- Jacob!

1181
01:33:36,582 --> 01:33:37,844
Kiss me.

1182
01:33:41,220 --> 01:33:44,678
I'm asking you to kiss me.

1183
01:34:32,472 --> 01:34:35,100
That should have been our first kiss.

1184
01:34:40,714 --> 01:34:42,113
I gotta go.

1185
01:34:45,051 --> 01:34:46,450
I'll be back.

1186
01:35:16,684 --> 01:35:20,085
- You saw.
- No, but...

1187
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:22,851
Jacob's thoughts are pretty loud.

1188
01:35:24,392 --> 01:35:25,916
I don't know what happened.

1189
01:35:27,928 --> 01:35:29,361
You love him.

1190
01:35:33,768 --> 01:35:35,565
I love you more.

1191
01:35:37,304 --> 01:35:38,669

Seth, go.

She knew we weren't there,
but she caught my scent.

1206

In fact, she'll be glad
she doesn't have to deal with you anymore.

1213
01:38:53,805 --> 01:38:58,174
Don't listen, Riley.
I told you about their mind tricks.

So I know what she thinks of you.

to avenge her true mate, James.

That's the only thing she cares about.
Not you.

1221
01:39:29,642 --> 01:39:31,507
That's the only reason she chose you.

1222
01:39:33,212 --> 01:39:35,442
She doesn't love you.

1223

Riley. Don't let him do this to us.

1224

You know I love you.

You want me to feel the pain you felt
when I killed James,

when I tore him to pieces,

1232

in exchange for her surrender.

I don't know! Riley wouldn't tell us.

1282
01:46:21,227 --> 01:46:23,287
He said our thoughts weren't safe.

1283
01:46:23,364 --> 01:46:26,629
Her name was Victoria.
Perhaps you knew her.

1284
01:46:27,535 --> 01:46:30,800
DR. CULLEN: Edward,
if the Volturi had knowledge of Victoria,

1285
01:46:30,871 --> 01:46:31,860
they would have stopped her.

1286
01:46:33,407 --> 01:46:34,704
Isn't that right, Jane?

1287
01:46:37,111 --> 01:46:38,601
Of course.

Felix.

1289
01:46:42,450 --> 01:46:43,883
She didn't know what she was doing.

We'll take responsibility for her.

Give her a chance.

1292

The Volturi don't give second chances.
Keep that in mind.

1293
01:46:59,633 --> 01:47:02,500
Caius will be interested to know
that she's still human.

1294
01:47:02,870 --> 01:47:04,963
The date is set.

1295
01:47:07,341 --> 01:47:11,004

1298
01:47:46,515 --> 01:47:50,007
- It's been going on for a while.
- EMBRY: Doc's re-breaking his bones.

1299
01:47:50,085 --> 01:47:51,916
Why did he have to butt in?
I could've taken that tick.

1300
01:47:51,987 --> 01:47:53,511
Give it a rest, Leah.

1301
01:48:00,095 --> 01:48:01,927
The worst is over. He'll be all right.

1302
01:48:02,965 --> 01:48:04,125
I gave him some morphine,

1303
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:06,532
but his body temperature
will burn it off soon.

1304
01:48:06,602 --> 01:48:08,661
I'll come back to set up a drip.

1305
01:48:09,205 --> 01:48:10,638
Thank you.

1306
01:48:20,583 --> 01:48:21,777
He's asking for you.

1307
01:48:37,099 --> 01:48:38,157
Hey, Jake.

1308
01:48:41,737 --> 01:48:43,000
Hey.

1309
01:48:55,886 --> 01:48:59,686
- I was worried about you.
- You were worried about me?

1310
01:49:01,458 --> 01:49:03,050
Yeah.

1311
01:49:04,061 --> 01:49:06,859
I guessed Edward would read my thoughts.

1312
01:49:09,533 --> 01:49:12,991
- Was he hard on you?
- He wasn't even mad at me.

1313
01:49:14,238 --> 01:49:15,398
Or you.

1314
01:49:16,907 --> 01:49:18,397
Well, damn.

1315
01:49:20,911 --> 01:49:24,870
- He's better than I thought.
- He's not playing a game.

1316
01:49:27,417 --> 01:49:28,679
Right.

1317
01:49:32,222 --> 01:49:33,519
Bella.

1318
01:49:36,827 --> 01:49:39,661
He's not as perfect as you think.

1319
01:49:43,201 --> 01:49:44,896
I know who he is.

1320
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:51,640
Can we just not talk about that?

1321
01:49:52,844 --> 01:49:55,904
I'd rather get all the re-breaking done
at once.

1322
01:50:02,020 --> 01:50:04,853
Well, at least I know
I did everything I could.

1323
01:50:08,693 --> 01:50:12,026
It wasn't easy making you admit
your feelings for me.

1324
01:50:15,466 --> 01:50:18,492
I only fought them because I knew
they wouldn't change anything.

1325
01:50:26,711 --> 01:50:29,647
I'm exactly right for you, Bella.

1326
01:50:32,151 --> 01:50:36,815
It would be as easy as breathing, with me.

1327
01:50:42,828 --> 01:50:45,126
You know I love you.

1328
01:50:51,904 --> 01:50:54,805
You know how much I wish it was enough.

1329
01:51:06,685 --> 01:51:07,845
Should I come back?

1330
01:51:11,056 --> 01:51:12,751
I need some time.

1331
01:51:17,464 --> 01:51:19,557
But I'll always be waiting.

1332
01:51:24,804 --> 01:51:27,602
Until my heart stops beating.

1333
01:51:29,576 --> 01:51:30,907
Maybe even then.

1334
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:58,300
- August 13th?
- Yeah. It's a month before my birthday.

1335
01:51:58,905 --> 01:52:01,999
I don't need to be
another year older than you.

1336
01:52:02,809 --> 01:52:04,606
Alice said she could get the wedding
together by then.

1337
01:52:05,713 --> 01:52:07,408
I'm sure she can.

1338
01:52:09,784 --> 01:52:11,445
There's no rush.

1339
01:52:14,021 --> 01:52:17,218
I've chosen my life. I want
to start living it.

1340
01:52:18,192 --> 01:52:21,650
And so you're gonna let Alice
plan the whole thing?

1341
01:52:21,996 --> 01:52:26,490
The dress, the reception, the guest list.

1342
01:52:26,567 --> 01:52:29,365
I mean, who knows who
she's gonna invite?

1343
01:52:31,372 --> 01:52:32,930
Does it matter?

1344
01:52:37,545 --> 01:52:39,479
I just don't know why
you're doing this.

1345
01:52:39,547 --> 01:52:42,744
- What? The wedding?
- No.

1346
01:52:45,719 --> 01:52:48,552
You're trying to make
everyone else happy,

1347
01:52:49,490 --> 01:52:52,050
but you're already giving
away too much.

1348
01:52:52,993 --> 01:52:54,484
You're wrong.

1349
01:53:02,504 --> 01:53:05,871
This wasn't a choice
between you and Jacob.

1350
01:53:09,711 --> 01:53:13,807
It was between who I should be
and who I am.

1351
01:53:17,519 --> 01:53:22,513
I've always felt out of step,
like literally stumbling through my life.

1352
01:53:25,694 --> 01:53:27,594
I've never felt normal.

1353
01:53:30,132 --> 01:53:32,066
Because I'm not normal.

1354
01:53:33,301 --> 01:53:34,962
I don't want to be.

1355
01:53:36,471 --> 01:53:41,704
I've had to face death
and loss and pain

1356
01:53:43,079 --> 01:53:46,242
in your world,
but I've also never felt stronger

1357
01:53:48,918 --> 01:53:52,251
and more real, more myself.

1358
01:53:54,991 --> 01:53:57,152
Because it's my world, too.

1359
01:54:00,396 --> 01:54:02,159
It's where I belong.

1360
01:54:09,005 --> 01:54:11,166
So it's not just about me?

1361
01:54:13,409 --> 01:54:16,435
No. Sorry.

1362
01:54:18,814 --> 01:54:23,877
I've made a mess trying to figure
all this out, but I wanna do it right.

1363
01:54:25,254 --> 01:54:29,657
And I wanna tie myself to you
in every way humanly possible.

1364
01:54:33,997 --> 01:54:35,555
Starting with a wedding.

1365
01:54:39,836 --> 01:54:41,235
Actually,

1366
01:54:42,139 --> 01:54:47,099
something a little more difficult first.
And maybe even dangerous.

1367
01:54:52,849 --> 01:54:54,282
We have to tell Charlie.

1368
01:54:58,455 --> 01:54:59,717
It's highly dangerous.

1369
01:55:00,791 --> 01:55:02,952
It's a good thing you're bulletproof.

1370
01:55:05,028 --> 01:55:06,552
I'm gonna need that ring.
