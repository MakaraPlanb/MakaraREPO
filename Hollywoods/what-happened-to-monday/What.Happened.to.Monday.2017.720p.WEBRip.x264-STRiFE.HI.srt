- Yes, you can, as long as it's your day.

at the same time, ever.

Even with your bracelet.

172
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,833
And, wherever you are
and whatever you're doing...

173
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,000
you can never tell a soul
that you're a sibling.

174
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,750
That's very important. You understand?

175
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:34,458
Okay. Well, we begin tomorrow.

176
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,458
Starting with you, Thursday.

177
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,375
[man sighs]

178
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,750
You ready to do this?

179
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,583
[breathes deeply]

180
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,375
Okay.

181
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,500

Don't forget, you're the one
and only Karen Settman.

191
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,375
The end of the day meeting
is the most important part of your day.

192
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:01,458
It's the time to share
every detail with your siblings.

193
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,792
Okay?

194
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,583

Mm...

[loud clamoring]

[beeps]

201
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,375
- Oh, God.
- Poor kid. Straight to the cryobank.

202
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:42,583
With Cayman running for Parliament,
security's getting tighter.

203
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:44,417
I fucking hate that bitch.

204
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,458
I don't know.
Maybe cryosleep isn't such a bad idea.

205
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:51,500
We turn ourselves in, get frozen,

206
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:55,208
play <i>Sleeping Beauty</i>
until the population drops.

207
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:58,542
[sighs] I heard you still dream,
like, horrible nightmares

208
00:18:58,625 --> 00:18:59,792
for hundreds of years.

209
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:03,667
By the time you wake up,
everyone you know and love will be gone.

210
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,750
Well, we go to sleep together,
we wake up together.

211
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,083
The Child Allocation Act
will be a thing of the past,

212
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:11,601
and we can finally live our own lives.

213
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,545
Are we really gonna have
this conversation again?

214
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:16,000
Why can't you just accept
that this is your family?

215
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,917
This isn't a family.
It's a repressive regime.

216
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,625
I didn't pick this life
any more than you did.

217
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,500
Yet you live it so perfectly.

218
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,125
Karen Settman from cradle to grave.

219
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,375
- It's disgusting.
- [scoffs] What do you care?

220
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,958
Your only ambition was to be
a total loser, which you are.

221
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:33,625
Fuck you, Monday.

222
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:36,958
Just because I have
my own personality and dreams,

223
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,458
and I want to have a relationship

224
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:42,000
that is more than just a random fuck
with someone that I will never see again?

225
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,625
I'm sick to death
of Miss Karen fucking Settman.

226
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,708
Karen Settman is the foundation
we built our lives on.

227
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:54,500
No, she's a mask,
a mask we put on one day a week.

228
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,042
One day a week
we can go out into the real world,

229
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,184
and we can't even be ourselves.

230
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:01,083
- We have to be a fake person.
- Oh, shut up, both of you!

231
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:07,125
- You're driving us all crazy.
- Yeah, this is our life. It is what it is.

232
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,833
Being trapped in this prison
six days a week isn't a life.

233
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:14,625
It's a slow, agonizing,
soul-sucking death.

234
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,917
[sighs]

Move over!

239
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:36,042
Saturday, let's go.
Or you'll be late for your recital.

240

[door closing]

242
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:56,583
So... you didn't see her leave...

243
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,375
and you don't have any idea
where she might be.

244
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,333
Well...

245
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,292
- When did you see her last?
- [knocking on door]

[groaning]

260
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:19,417
What if the Bureau caught you?

261
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,083
One mistake is all it takes
to put all your lives at risk.

262
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:26,083
I hate Karen Settman!
I wish I had never been born!

263
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:27,167
Enough!

264
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:31,500
You want to get taken away?

265
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,250
Get frozen for all eternity
in that god-awful machine

266
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:36,542
and never see me or your sisters again?

267
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:42,208
Go.

268
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,792
Monday.

269
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:51,792
I warned you.
Everything you do affects each other.

270
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,417
[ominous music playing]

271
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:02,167
- What's that for?
- Keep still.

What happens to one of you...

275
00:23:20,042 --> 00:23:21,708
happens to you all.

276
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:28,208
Monday...

277
00:23:33,042 --> 00:23:34,458
I need you to be brave.

278
00:23:35,792 --> 00:23:37,500
Set an example for your sisters.

279
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:43,917
Will it hurt?

280
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:48,958
Yes.

281
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Don't move.

I bet that rat tasted better going down.

285

- Shut up.
- [shower curtains closing]

286
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,750
You're burning up. You running a fever?

287
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:37,708
No.

288
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,042
- You sure?
- I'm fine.

289
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:46,667
[vomits, coughs]

290
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,417
- Maybe you should switch days.
- I can do Monday.

291
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:55,208
Success does not come
without sacrifice and struggle.

292
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:58,583

Shut the fuck up.

These lines are getting worse.

00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:41,934
Last week, a woman gave birth right here
because she couldn't get through.

I'm afraid I have to ask you

The Bureau's a stickler for protocol.
You understand.

No.

I always thought, with a body like that,
you'd fuck your way to the top.

But then it turns out,
you're a frigid bitch.

- Just because I find you repulsive?
- [chuckles]

00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:46,875
- Did you try her again?
- Yeah. Straight to voicemail.

347
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:49,583
- Maybe she got held up.
- She would have called.

348
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:52,458
Ping her bracelet.

349
00:30:01,792 --> 00:30:04,250
- That's weird.
- What?

350
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:05,667
Her GPS locator is off.

351
00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:09,208
She's not showing up on the grid.

352
00:30:10,667 --> 00:30:15,292
- She can't just vanish.
- Oh, yes, you can... if you want to.

353
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:17,083
Maybe she was in an accident.

354
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:20,292
Run a search.
Um, hospitals, police records.

355
00:30:21,917 --> 00:30:24,333
What if Monday's hurt? Or dead?

356
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:28,667
And the authorities find her
before we do? [gasps]

357
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:33,708
Then... Karen Settman no longer exists.

358
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,542
And our lives are over.

359
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:39,042
Jeez, she's only a few minutes late.

360
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:43,542
Monday's never been late
for an end of day meeting.

361
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:45,167
[sighs]

362
00:30:49,542 --> 00:30:50,542
Ever.

363
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:17,208
[dings, buzzes]

364
00:31:18,417 --> 00:31:20,042
[breathes deeply]

365
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,042

"Eyes bloodshot from excessive drug use

[voice fading out]

369
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:06,250
- Ow!
- Stay still.

370
00:32:11,167 --> 00:32:13,375
Really? Pot brownie?

371
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:17,625
It's medicinal.
You know it's good for my nerves.

372
00:32:18,708 --> 00:32:19,917
[exhales deeply]

373
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:23,083
I have a bad feeling about this.

374
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:26,267
Remember what happened last time
two of us were out there at once.

375
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:29,333
That was bad.

376
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:35,583
We gotta figure out where Monday is.
You gotta act as if everything is normal.

377
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:41,167
Easy for you to say. It's not your day.
What if we've been listed?

378
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:44,917
Listen to me.
If Karen Settman's been listed,

379
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,880
the Bureau would've kicked in the door,
and we'd all be processed by now.

380
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:49,875
Well...

381
00:32:51,292 --> 00:32:53,875
technically speaking,
one of us would get to live.

382
00:32:55,792 --> 00:32:57,042
[sighs]

383
00:32:57,125 --> 00:32:59,208
[elevator whirring]

384
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:09,042
- Good morning, Miss Settman.
- Good morning, Eddie.

385
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,917
I didn't see you come home yesterday.

386
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:18,500

After hours. Let myself in.

So, we got our promotion.

397

Stay focused, Tuesday.

Check the calendar, desktop,

[door opens]

400
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,958
I've got the brief
for your conference call.

401
00:34:36,042 --> 00:34:38,375
Vicky, when was the last time
you synched my tablet?

402
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:41,625
9:03 this morning. Why?

403
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:44,833
Um, I forgot to log out last night.

404
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:47,375
You left early to celebrate.

405
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:49,708
[chuckles]
Yes, of course.

406
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:51,667
Um...

407
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:55,167
[chuckles]
Where did I go again?

408
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:59,333
Your favorite bar. Harry's.

409
00:34:59,417 --> 00:35:03,167

Yes, of course. Harry's. Thanks.

410
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,250
You're welcome.

- [sighs] Cheers.
- Cheers.

414
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:53,833
Mm...

415
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:55,875
[chuckles]

416
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:58,500
Last night, um...
do you remember what...

417
00:35:58,583 --> 00:35:59,833
what time I left?

418
00:36:00,417 --> 00:36:03,375
You only stayed for one drink.
You barely touched it.

419
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:05,458
I think that colleague of yours
put you off.

420
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,250
Yeah.

421
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:10,417
God, yeah. Which one of them?

422
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,125
You know, that douchebag
in the suspenders.

423
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:18,000
- Jerry, I think?
- Yeah.

424
00:36:20,792 --> 00:36:23,417
Monday and Jerry argued
just before she left the bar.

425
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,625
[scoffs]
He's onto us.

426
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:30,125
- I knew it.
- Fucking dick sold us out.

427
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:33,667
Then why aren't we listed?
You've got to corner him, Tuesday.

428
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:37,417
- Find out what he knows.
- Are you nuts?

429
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,958
He could be the last person
who saw Monday.

430

Miss Settman.

434
00:36:57,917 --> 00:36:58,917
Yes?

435
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:01,292
Step into the van, please.

436
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,500
Is there a problem?

437
00:37:04,833 --> 00:37:06,792
I don't understand. Who are you?

00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,958
[suspenseful music playing]

439
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,375

Wha...?

443
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:36,583
That's weird. I lost her.

446
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:03,833
There's obviously been a mistake.

447
00:38:04,542 --> 00:38:06,458
Can you please tell me
what I'm doing here?

448
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:35,375
[woman]
Miss Settman.

449

What a pleasure to meet you.

00:39:01,417 --> 00:39:03,500
I know who you are. Uh...

452
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:10,125
Can you please tell me why I'm here?

You poor child.

00:39:17,292 --> 00:39:20,250
I am amazed you made it this far.

455

This is... This is all a big mistake.

456
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:28,042
Seven children.

457
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,833
What was your grandfather thinking?

458
00:39:33,625 --> 00:39:36,583
Do you have any idea
how much food and water

459
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:39,792
was taken out of others' mouths
so you could be here today?

460
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:44,792
If everyone were as cruel and selfish
as Terrence Settman,

461
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:46,417
the world would end tomorrow.

462
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:53,750
I am an only child.

463
00:39:56,458 --> 00:39:58,375
For your sake, I wish that were true.

464
00:40:00,292 --> 00:40:01,412
There are five of them left.

All the rotten eggs in one basket.

466
00:40:08,292 --> 00:40:10,792

- Not if you want to keep it quiet.

We can make some kind of deal! Please!

473
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:32,583
That's what the last one said.

We can't just sit here.

481
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:27,417
We gotta help her. We gotta...
We gotta go out there.

Is it bad?

544
00:47:56,042 --> 00:47:57,917
It's okay. Look at me.

545
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:09,167
I don't want to die. I don't want to die.

546
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:13,250
You're gonna be okay.
I'm here. It's okay.

547
00:48:21,458 --> 00:48:22,458
I'm sorry.

548
00:48:24,208 --> 00:48:25,625
I'm so sorry.

549
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:29,042
No. You're Sunday.

550
00:48:31,833 --> 00:48:33,542
You're supposed to be the believer.

551
00:48:44,292 --> 00:48:46,167
I don't know what I believe.

552
00:48:49,583 --> 00:48:51,000
I don't...

553
00:48:56,417 --> 00:48:57,792
I don't know who I am.

Goddamn it!

561
00:50:17,958 --> 00:50:19,042
[Cayman]
They won't suffer.

562
00:50:20,458 --> 00:50:22,375
- Excuse me?
- I'm assured of that.

563
00:50:24,833 --> 00:50:25,833
Um...

564
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,542
We may have a containment problem.

565
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:31,792
We still haven't heard back
from the Settman team.

566
00:50:37,125 --> 00:50:42,333
Last night, I dreamed this whole building
erupted and spewed out all the siblings.

567
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:45,958
There were so many of them.

568
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:49,208
A sea of little bodies...

569
00:50:51,125 --> 00:50:52,750
scorched by flames.

570
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,708
I know what you feel for these children.

571
00:50:57,042 --> 00:51:00,042
But this is on their parents, not you.

572
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:02,583
Sometimes, I think, "To hell with it."

573
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:05,542
To hell with everybody.

574
00:51:07,292 --> 00:51:09,083
Humans will never learn.

575
00:51:09,667 --> 00:51:12,167
You're our last chance, Dr. Cayman.

576
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:15,792
Our only hope.

577
00:51:19,792 --> 00:51:22,542
I need you, Joe. Be careful.

578
00:51:24,292 --> 00:51:27,333
Do not underestimate the Settmans.

579
00:51:28,167 --> 00:51:30,928
If we officially list them,
they'll be flagged at the first checkpoint

580
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,417
and processed within hours.

581
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:37,458
Seven siblings surviving to adulthood?
It would destroy my credibility. No.

582
00:51:38,333 --> 00:51:40,083
We have to keep this localized.

583
00:51:40,667 --> 00:51:43,042
They are trapped inside that apartment
and they know it.

584
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:47,375
Besides... we have another issue.

585
00:51:49,083 --> 00:51:50,375
A complication.

586
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:52,833
Make that a priority.

587
00:51:53,583 --> 00:51:56,792
Then deal with the Settmans.

588
00:52:17,458 --> 00:52:18,958
[retches, coughs]

589
00:52:28,042 --> 00:52:32,083
[beeping]

590
00:52:32,167 --> 00:52:33,542
It's Tuesday's.

591
00:52:33,625 --> 00:52:36,083
[sighs]
No...

592
00:52:37,375 --> 00:52:39,083
[Saturday cries]

[mutters]
What the fuck are we doing? Huh?

595
00:53:04,708 --> 00:53:06,583
We gotta get out of here now.

596
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,208
They know about us.
They're gonna send more people.

597
00:53:10,292 --> 00:53:13,375
Let them come. I'll fucking kill them all.

598
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:14,875
Calm down.

599
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,208
Just think for a second.

600
00:53:18,708 --> 00:53:21,125
Four of us out there at once?
With all the Bureau agents

601
00:53:21,208 --> 00:53:22,583
and checkpoints and sensors?

602
00:53:22,667 --> 00:53:25,042
[scoffs]
We won't last for two minutes.

603
00:53:25,125 --> 00:53:29,792
We always work best as a team...
in an environment we can control.

604
00:53:29,875 --> 00:53:31,542
Those guys, they weren't Bureau.

605
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:35,875
Or we'd be listed by now, and this place
would be crawling with agents.

606
00:53:35,958 --> 00:53:38,375
Somebody wants us to disappear.

607

- [whirring]
- [breathing heavily]

608
00:53:47,833 --> 00:53:49,750
The question is why.

[dings, buzzes]

610
00:54:03,083 --> 00:54:04,875
[scoffs]
Fuck it.

611
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:10,417
Every Wednesday,
I wear a stupid dress and high heels.

612
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,917
Not today.

613
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:16,833
- What's that?
- Something I wish I thought of yesterday.

614
00:54:16,917 --> 00:54:20,292
I customized it,
so we'll see and hear everything you do.

615
00:54:22,417 --> 00:54:24,000
It's a user-locked grip.

616
00:54:25,458 --> 00:54:27,083
- [weapon beeps]
- Can you unlock it?

617
00:54:27,167 --> 00:54:28,333
If I had more time.

618
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,917
For now, it's not gonna fire.

619
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,708
- Doesn't make it any less intimidating.
- This isn't a game, Wednesday.

620
00:54:35,792 --> 00:54:40,000
Go to Jerry's. Find out what he knows.
Don't lose your head out there.

621
00:54:43,167 --> 00:54:44,167
I won't.

Hello, Karen.
You're cutting it close. Aren't you?

00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:23,250
Please.

[thunder rumbling]

632
00:55:46,667 --> 00:55:47,708
What's it gonna be?

633
00:55:52,333 --> 00:55:54,167
What's what gonna be?

634
00:55:55,208 --> 00:55:57,417
Do we have a deal or not?

635
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Deal...

636
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:02,667
What deal?

637
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:04,958
Playing dumb doesn't suit ya, Settman.

638
00:56:06,542 --> 00:56:07,542
This is very simple.

639
00:56:08,792 --> 00:56:10,542
You pass on the promotion.

640
00:56:11,125 --> 00:56:12,167
It goes to me.

641
00:56:12,833 --> 00:56:15,792
And I keep my mouth shut
about your little secret.

- Huh?
- [chuckles nervously]

647
00:56:38,333 --> 00:56:42,292
You should be glad it was me
who found that contract,

648
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,833
or you'd be in jail by now.

649

650

407-C funds transfer.

652
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:58,250

On my tablet.

664

[suspenseful music playing]

676
00:58:58,625 --> 00:59:00,125
Best option is front door.

677
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:07,000
- Spread out.
- That's not an option.

Are you okay?

710
01:03:33,167 --> 01:03:35,792
<i>- Can you run?</i>
- I think so.

[grunting]

712
01:03:38,458 --> 01:03:39,458
Then run.

[suspenseful music playing]

714
01:03:54,542 --> 01:03:55,958
Go, go, go!

715
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,417
Guys, where am I going?

716
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:02,417
Next left. There's a door
at the end of the alley.

Come on.

723
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,083
What are you waiting for? Go get her!

724
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:23,000
[woman]
Everybody move!

725
01:05:34,583 --> 01:05:35,583
Move!

726
01:05:37,375 --> 01:05:38,625
Get out of the fucking way!

727
01:05:38,708 --> 01:05:40,417
- Get out of the way!
- Move!

[Wednesday]
<i>What do I do?</i>

729
01:06:04,792 --> 01:06:08,375
We need to get you on the roof.
I can get you home from there.

730
01:06:08,458 --> 01:06:09,458
Hold tight.

731
01:06:09,542 --> 01:06:12,833

01:06:19,958 --> 01:06:21,917
- Oh, shit.
- It's the Bureau.

734
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,583
- I thought you said we're not listed.
- We're not.

735
01:06:24,667 --> 01:06:28,458
- Then what the fuck is he doing here?
- Friday? Friday!

736
01:06:32,583 --> 01:06:34,250
[knocking continues]

737
01:06:34,333 --> 01:06:36,417
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait!

738
01:06:38,208 --> 01:06:40,208
- What are you gonna do?
- Find out what he wants.

739
01:06:42,042 --> 01:06:43,042
And get rid of him.

740
01:06:47,542 --> 01:06:48,542
I got this.

741
01:06:52,333 --> 01:06:54,167
[man knocking]
Hey, open up!

01:06:56,875 --> 01:07:00,458

[chuckles]

744
01:07:04,583 --> 01:07:06,375
- Hey.
- Hey.

745
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:09,958
New look?

746
01:07:13,292 --> 01:07:14,417
Y-Yeah.

747
01:07:15,333 --> 01:07:18,875
Yeah, I wanted to, um...
try something new.

748
01:07:18,958 --> 01:07:20,542
Nice.

749
01:07:20,625 --> 01:07:21,917
[chuckles]

750
01:07:23,125 --> 01:07:26,625
Um, I called your... your office.
They said you were out sick.

751
01:07:27,542 --> 01:07:29,142
I know. I know I'm not supposed to call,

752
01:07:29,167 --> 01:07:33,083
- but when I saw you at the Bureau, I was...
- The... The Bureau?

753
01:07:35,625 --> 01:07:36,625
Yeah.

754
01:07:37,625 --> 01:07:39,458
Yeah, yeah, I had to go and, um...

755
01:07:41,542 --> 01:07:42,667
drop off some stuff.

756
01:07:44,708 --> 01:07:46,083
Boring bank stuff.

757
01:07:50,917 --> 01:07:52,583
Aren't you going to invite me in?

758
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:55,792
I was only joking about the forced entry.

759
01:07:55,875 --> 01:07:57,292
[both chuckle]

761
01:08:03,625 --> 01:08:05,667
[whispering]
Hold on. We've got a situation.

762
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:07,125
You've got a situation?

763
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:08,208
[beeps]

764
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:15,750
It's a nice place.

765
01:08:16,458 --> 01:08:19,042
Friday? You there?

[machinery clanking, hissing]

767

Who the fuck is this guy?

[grunts]

769
01:09:11,208 --> 01:09:12,250
Please don't do that.

770
01:09:13,542 --> 01:09:14,542
What?

771
01:09:16,083 --> 01:09:18,167
Are you... Are you serious?

772
01:09:19,458 --> 01:09:21,708
Sorry, I thought you liked
that stuff. I'm...

773
01:09:23,375 --> 01:09:24,375
Just, um...

774
01:09:25,542 --> 01:09:28,583
Just... give me a sec.

775
01:09:29,167 --> 01:09:31,417
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

776
01:09:48,833 --> 01:09:50,083
[mouthing words]

777
01:09:50,167 --> 01:09:53,208
- What the hell is going on?
- You tell me. Who is that guy?

778
01:09:53,292 --> 01:09:55,125
Don't bullshit me.
Have you been seeing him?

779
01:09:55,208 --> 01:09:56,542
What? No.

780
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:59,167
He's a Bureau agent.
Do you think I'm fucking stupid?

781
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:02,625
- You two seemed very familiar.
- [scoffs] It's called acting.

782
01:10:02,708 --> 01:10:05,625
How do I know you're not acting now
and you've been seeing him all along?

783
01:10:05,708 --> 01:10:06,958
[sighs]

784
01:10:07,042 --> 01:10:10,417
I've never seen him in my life,
I swear to God.

785
01:10:15,833 --> 01:10:18,458
You need to... to get him
to take you to his place

786
01:10:18,542 --> 01:10:20,708
and find out which one of us
he's been seeing.

787
01:10:20,792 --> 01:10:23,708
- What?
- Yeah, find out what he knows.

788
01:10:23,792 --> 01:10:26,542
Have you lost it completely?
You want me to go with him?

789
01:10:26,625 --> 01:10:27,625
[beeps]

790
01:10:27,708 --> 01:10:30,333
- Yeah.
- I think he wants to fuck me.

791
01:10:30,417 --> 01:10:32,083
Well, no shit.

792
01:10:37,292 --> 01:10:39,417
- Show me your bracelet.
- Why?

793
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:42,292
It's a coupling device
from the dead guy's bracelet.

794
01:10:43,083 --> 01:10:45,208
All you need to do
is get yours close to his.

795
01:10:45,292 --> 01:10:46,667
[muttering]

796
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:48,292
Wait. What?

797
01:10:48,875 --> 01:10:52,542
Just activate your bracelet
and connect it to that guy's,

798
01:10:52,625 --> 01:10:54,833
and we get a gateway
into the Bureau's servers.

799
01:10:59,292 --> 01:11:00,625
[sighs]

800
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:04,417
What if he catches me?

801
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:07,792
Well, I'm sure you know
a few tricks to distract him.

802
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:10,958
Well, I don't know any tricks.

803
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:14,333
What do you mean?

804
01:11:20,958 --> 01:11:22,250
All your big talk...

805
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:26,042
You've never been with anyone?

806
01:11:30,458 --> 01:11:31,500
I'll be right there!

807
01:11:55,583 --> 01:11:57,250
Oh, God! Wednesday!

01:11:58,292 --> 01:11:59,292
Oh, shit!

809
01:12:05,958 --> 01:12:08,208
- We're back.
- [Wednesday] <i>About time.</i>

01:12:08,292 --> 01:12:10,333
- [computer dings]
- There's, uh, roof access.

Guys...

814
01:12:40,833 --> 01:12:42,708
There is no way I can clear this.

815
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:45,125
There's only two ways
out of this, Wednesday.

816
01:12:45,208 --> 01:12:48,750
You make that jump or you catch a bullet.
At least, this way, you stand a chance.

817
01:12:58,583 --> 01:12:59,583
[thunder rumbling]

818
01:13:04,125 --> 01:13:05,958
You've been training for this
your whole life.

819
01:13:06,667 --> 01:13:07,667
You can do it.

01:13:08,708 --> 01:13:09,708

Move! Move!

821
01:13:12,625 --> 01:13:14,125

Get her to the processing center.

827
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:34,583
- They'll know what to do.
- [zipping up bag]

828
01:14:35,667 --> 01:14:36,667
I'll call it in.

What do you want to drink?

830
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:50,125
- A shot of vodka.
- Oh.

The file from Wednesday.

839
01:16:12,958 --> 01:16:17,042
It's a 407-C funds transfer,
just like Jerry said.

840
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:23,250
Why would Karen Settman

841
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:28,542
illegally transfer millions of euros
into Nicolette Cayman's campaign fund?

842
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:35,708
This contract was executed the same day
as we got our promotion.

843
01:16:39,625 --> 01:16:41,042
A transfer that big...

844
01:16:41,958 --> 01:16:42,958
Hm...

845
01:16:46,167 --> 01:16:49,708
Karen Settman really needed
that promotion.

You know, where they keep people.

I gotta go.

There's this big event
at the Bureau tonight.

01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,681
Cayman's starting her push for Parliament.

883

Why are you working for them?

The Bureau? Why not?

01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:32,042
Well, couldn't you get another job?

Why would I want another job?

01:21:34,458 --> 01:21:37,875
Don't you think it's wrong
to be rounding up siblings?

888
01:21:37,958 --> 01:21:40,333
Have you ever set foot
in the lower sectors?

889
01:21:41,125 --> 01:21:43,000
I mean, most of these kids
that we pick up,

890
01:21:43,083 --> 01:21:45,500
they live in really shitty conditions.

891
01:21:45,583 --> 01:21:48,500
[chuckles]
Trust me, we're doing them a favor.

892
01:21:48,583 --> 01:21:50,667
By sending them off to the cryobank?

893
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:56,042
Yeah. For now.

894
01:21:56,625 --> 01:21:57,917
Until we see better days.

895
01:22:04,792 --> 01:22:05,792
See you later?

896
01:22:08,875 --> 01:22:12,417
I have some... work stuff to catch up on.

897
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:20,458
- Let's meet on our usual day.
- We talked about this, right?

898
01:22:22,375 --> 01:22:24,083
I just wanna be with you every day.

899
01:22:25,958 --> 01:22:27,417
Not just Monday.

900
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
See you, babe.

<i>So, Monday's been seeing Adrian
for months.</i>

905
01:22:56,042 --> 01:22:58,667
Miss Perfect likes
to be choked during sex.

906
01:22:58,750 --> 01:23:00,125
<i>Can you believe it?</i>

907
01:23:01,125 --> 01:23:02,625
Cayman is holding her hostage.

908
01:23:03,208 --> 01:23:05,958
What? Monday's alive?

909
01:23:06,042 --> 01:23:07,125
Yeah.

910
01:23:07,208 --> 01:23:11,083
Be careful, Saturday.
This Bureau agent could be playing us.

911
01:23:15,667 --> 01:23:18,167
I... I don't know.

912
01:23:22,958 --> 01:23:26,333
<i>I don't think so. I'm scared, Thursday.</i>

913
01:23:27,333 --> 01:23:29,917
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna get through this.

914
01:23:30,958 --> 01:23:33,208
Every day we set foot outside,
we beat the odds.

915
01:23:34,667 --> 01:23:36,167
We're gonna get Monday out,

916
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:38,458
and we're gonna show the world
who Cayman really is.

917

- We gotta go!
- No! It's everything.

925
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:02,167
- Our whole life is in here.
- There's no time.

926
01:25:02,250 --> 01:25:04,500
This is the only proof we ever existed.

927
01:25:04,583 --> 01:25:08,167
Come on. Forget it. We gotta go. Okay?

928
01:25:10,208 --> 01:25:11,042
Okay.

Friday, what are you doing?

01:26:03,333 --> 01:26:04,375
Friday!

Please, there's still time!

It's okay. I'm not like the rest of you.

01:40:04,208 --> 01:40:09,083
But, through it all, through your donation
and my push for Parliament,

1069
01:40:09,167 --> 01:40:12,667
we might just still have another chance.

1070
01:40:22,042 --> 01:40:23,042
Take your wig off.

1071
01:40:27,125 --> 01:40:28,125
Take it off!

1072
01:40:28,208 --> 01:40:30,917
[plastic rustling]

1073
01:40:33,167 --> 01:40:35,667
If you're beginning
to have second thoughts,

1074
01:40:35,750 --> 01:40:39,250
you should know that I've kept
one of your siblings alive as collateral.

1075
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:41,708
And, after all...

1076
01:40:42,292 --> 01:40:46,083
anyone who's willing to sacrifice
their own flesh and blood...

1077
01:40:46,917 --> 01:40:48,750
can never be fully trusted.

1078
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,583
[dings]

1079
01:40:59,792 --> 01:41:00,792
So...

1080
01:41:02,042 --> 01:41:06,167
how does it feel to be the one
and only Karen Settman?

1081
01:41:13,333 --> 01:41:16,708
When you get into the main server,
use the code Friday wrote.

1082
01:41:16,792 --> 01:41:18,500
Cayman's speech starts in 15 minutes.

1083
01:41:20,667 --> 01:41:24,083
- Let's go.
- Let's take this bitch down.

1084
01:41:49,958 --> 01:41:51,667
[applause]

1085
01:42:11,292 --> 01:42:12,292
Fuck.

1086
01:42:16,250 --> 01:42:18,208
[Tuesday]
Nobody moves!

1087
01:42:21,833 --> 01:42:23,125
Show me your hands!

1088
01:42:24,750 --> 01:42:25,750
Open the door!

1089
01:42:27,333 --> 01:42:30,750
- Open the fucking now or I'll shoot him!
- [Adrian] Do it! Do it.

1090
01:42:30,833 --> 01:42:31,833

- [door closes]

1099
01:43:58,167 --> 01:43:59,167
Monday.

1100
01:44:03,458 --> 01:44:04,500
I'm impressed.

1101
01:44:05,833 --> 01:44:08,333
You've never worn
Karen Settman so well.

1102
01:44:12,667 --> 01:44:16,292
- You think you own her. You don't.
- I do her justice.

1103
01:44:18,042 --> 01:44:19,042
You only pretend.

1104
01:44:23,042 --> 01:44:24,042
[beeps]

1105
01:44:25,167 --> 01:44:26,292

I'm deeply honored and grateful.</i>

[applause]

1108
01:44:35,542 --> 01:44:38,875
I gotta get to Cayman.
Get her away from the servers.

1109
01:44:43,750 --> 01:44:44,750
[grunts]

1110
01:44:47,542 --> 01:44:50,417
- [grunts]
- [glass shattering]

1111
01:44:52,083 --> 01:44:53,292
You sold us out.

1112
01:44:54,667 --> 01:44:55,875
How could you?

1113
01:44:56,708 --> 01:44:59,542
I thought you, of all people,
would understand.

1114
01:45:00,208 --> 01:45:03,042
Understand? We were your family.

1115
01:45:03,125 --> 01:45:04,875
What do you know about family?

1116
01:45:08,083 --> 01:45:12,000
All these years of endless lectures
on responsibility and sacrifice?

1117
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:15,292
I never saw you do any of it, not once.

1118
01:45:18,417 --> 01:45:20,333
I did everything I was told.

1119
01:45:21,208 --> 01:45:22,500
Everything right.

1120
01:45:22,583 --> 01:45:24,917
I did everything I could
to protect our family.

1121
01:45:25,417 --> 01:45:26,417
[scoffs]

1122
01:45:27,250 --> 01:45:28,958
You have a funny way of showing it.

1123
01:45:34,875 --> 01:45:37,167
Sunday died in my arms.

1124
01:45:40,792 --> 01:45:42,583
Wednesday fell to her death.

1125
01:45:42,667 --> 01:45:45,583
Saturday was shot in the head,
and Friday...

1126
01:45:47,208 --> 01:45:48,375
[sighs]

1127
01:45:53,583 --> 01:45:55,167
I didn't plan this.

1128
01:45:59,083 --> 01:46:01,083
I met Adrian and I fell in love.

1129
01:46:03,292 --> 01:46:04,583
And things changed.

1130
01:46:06,333 --> 01:46:10,167
I made a deal with Cayman, and...
[stammers] it got out of my control.

1131
01:46:13,625 --> 01:46:14,625
I'm sorry.

1132
01:46:20,417 --> 01:46:23,542
I'm sorry you...
you lost your finger because of me.

1133
01:46:25,292 --> 01:46:27,792
I was a... I was a total fuck-up.

1134
01:46:29,833 --> 01:46:32,542
If I could go back
and change it all, I would.

1135
01:46:37,083 --> 01:46:38,500
Karen Settman...

1136
01:46:39,750 --> 01:46:42,042
was so much more than any one of us.

1137
01:46:44,542 --> 01:46:45,792
She was all of us.

1138
01:46:49,750 --> 01:46:50,958
She was our family.

1139
01:46:51,542 --> 01:46:52,917
- [scoffs]
- [gun cocks]

1140
01:46:56,667 --> 01:46:58,417
I was the firstborn.

1141
01:47:00,125 --> 01:47:02,083
Karen Settman was always mine.

1142
01:47:03,667 --> 01:47:04,667
The rest of you?

1143
01:47:05,708 --> 01:47:07,542
You were just afterbirth.

1144
01:47:17,750 --> 01:47:22,708
For three decades,
the Child Allocation Bureau has combatted

1145
01:47:22,792 --> 01:47:27,333
the most serious crisis
our world has ever faced.

1146
01:47:27,417 --> 01:47:29,875
Catastrophic overpopulation.

1147
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:37,167
Critics may chastise our methods,

1148
01:47:37,792 --> 01:47:40,458
but the numbers don't lie.

In a perfect world,
every child has the right to live.

1153
01:48:10,792 --> 01:48:13,583
That's why I'm running for office.

1154
01:48:14,333 --> 01:48:16,583
So I can reform the law.
