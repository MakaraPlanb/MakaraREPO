00:00:00,287 --> 00:00:03,425
Previously on
AMC's The Walking Dead...

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:04,679
Pete's a surgeon.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:05,901
He's beating his wife.

4
00:00:05,948 --> 00:00:07,070
We have to stop it.

5
00:00:07,182 --> 00:00:08,149
Get away!

6
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,222
He killed Reg, we
didn't have a choice.

7
00:00:11,332 --> 00:00:12,232
Rick?

8
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:13,233
Do it.

9
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:17,060
What I'm proposing-
force 'em west, here.

10
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,100
They'll follow a path if
something's drawing 'em.

11
00:00:19,182 --> 00:00:20,049
It's open!

12
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,317
We've gotta do this now!

13
00:00:21,418 --> 00:00:24,186
Head back, tell
everyone what's happening.

14
00:00:24,287 --> 00:00:27,556
It's a horn or something, it's
pulling the back half off the road.

15
00:00:27,657 --> 00:00:29,037
It sounds
like it's coming from--

16
00:00:29,157 --> 00:00:30,183
Home.

17
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:34,931
It says the ignition switch fuse

18
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:36,766
is found at location number 27.

19
00:00:36,768 --> 00:00:38,902
All right, 27. I need
to know where that is.

20
00:00:40,372 --> 00:00:43,473
Um, right here.

21
00:00:43,475 --> 00:00:45,642
Yeah, okay, this one's blown.

22
00:00:45,644 --> 00:00:47,043
What's this one, the red one?

23
00:00:51,249 --> 00:00:53,016
Mom, Dad, we got to go.

24
00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:55,518
- Come on, come on.
- We see them.

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,440
Just need to find a fuse
so we can start the car.

26
00:00:57,481 --> 00:00:59,656
Almost got it, honey.
Location six.

27
00:00:59,658 --> 00:01:02,025
That's turn signal lamps
and stop lamps.

28
00:01:02,027 --> 00:01:03,860
All right, we can
live without turn signals.

29
00:01:03,862 --> 00:01:05,562
Dad, they're com--

00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:42,625
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

31
00:06:45,055 --> 00:06:46,456
Celery soup.

32
00:06:46,576 --> 00:06:48,068
It's been here since the start.

33
00:06:48,188 --> 00:06:49,887
You're very brave.

34
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,956
Well, I'm hoping
the paprika will mask

35
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,858
the soup's celeryness.

36
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,326
<i>Then you'd be
stuck with something</i>

37
00:06:55,328 --> 00:06:56,894
<i>that tastes like paprika.</i>

38
00:06:56,896 --> 00:06:58,763
No, thank you.

39
00:06:58,765 --> 00:07:01,132
<i>Well, I just figured since
we're running low on staples,</i>

40
00:07:01,134 --> 00:07:04,535
I'd try to use a few things
nobody seems to want.

41
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:09,073
I used to make Ed these
spring cleaning casseroles

42
00:07:09,075 --> 00:07:11,809
just to empty the pantry.

43
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:14,912
I made some miracles happen
with water chestnuts.

44
00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:18,950
Talk about miracles, that
recipe for cola canned ham.

45
00:07:18,952 --> 00:07:20,618
Mmm.

46
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,021
Ms. Peletier, you are
an honest to goodness hero.

47
00:07:27,192 --> 00:07:28,559
Ugh.

48
00:07:28,561 --> 00:07:30,395
<i>Something wrong, Shelly?</i>

49
00:07:30,397 --> 00:07:33,531
It's just those old noodles.

50
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:37,268
I mean, I tell you, if someone would
just find me one of those machines,

51
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:41,239
I swear we would all be eating
like we were on a tour of Tuscany.

52
00:07:43,675 --> 00:07:45,343
You know, Shel,
I could teach you

53
00:07:45,345 --> 00:07:47,979
how to make pasta
with your own two hands.

54
00:07:47,981 --> 00:07:50,615
But you'd have to promise
not to smoke in the house.

55
00:07:50,617 --> 00:07:52,483
It's just a disgusting habit.

56
00:07:52,485 --> 00:07:54,819
And it kills you.

57
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:56,754
If you ask me,
there are too many things

58
00:07:56,756 --> 00:07:58,689
trying to do that
already, right?

59
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,659
Right.

60
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:12,703
Your dad used to hit you and
then he got himself killed.

61
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:16,707
It happened.
Now it's done.

62
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:19,343
You live with it
or it eats you up.

63
00:08:19,345 --> 00:08:21,379
Go home.

64
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,966
Ron.

65
00:08:48,106 --> 00:08:50,374
Ron.

66
00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:52,510
Can you come down here?

67
00:09:06,358 --> 00:09:08,059
No.

68
00:09:08,061 --> 00:09:10,728
- Ron.
- No, I don't want a haircut.

69
00:09:11,897 --> 00:09:14,031
Look, I just gave myself one.

70
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:15,366
All right?
It's all set up.

71
00:09:15,368 --> 00:09:17,235
Don't make me do it
again next week.

72
00:09:17,237 --> 00:09:18,836
Take off your hat.

73
00:09:18,838 --> 00:09:21,506
- This is bullshit.
- What did you just--

74
00:09:21,508 --> 00:09:23,508
This is just you
trying to talk to me.

75
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:27,478
There are things
we need to talk about.

76
00:09:29,715 --> 00:09:31,249
There are things
that you need to learn.

77
00:09:31,251 --> 00:09:32,950
What, are you serious?

78
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,288
What is it? Do you--
do you blame me?

79
00:09:40,025 --> 00:09:42,660
Huh? Do you actually blame me?

80
00:09:44,363 --> 00:09:46,597
Raise your left arm
above your head.

81
00:09:49,268 --> 00:09:52,103
You can't.
Tell me why.

82
00:09:52,105 --> 00:09:53,704
No.

83
00:09:55,707 --> 00:09:57,542
Your father was dangerous.

84
00:09:57,544 --> 00:10:00,378
Rick is dangerous.

85
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,981
He doesn't have anything
to do with this.

86
00:10:03,582 --> 00:10:05,516
What, is he your friend?

87
00:10:07,386 --> 00:10:09,587
Yeah, he's my friend.

88
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,568
We got some panels to put up,

89
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,103
but we don't have to wait
to start growing things.

90
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:28,973
There will be some sore
backs and tired feet.

91
00:10:28,975 --> 00:10:31,642
That's how you know you've
put in a hard day's work.

92
00:10:41,453 --> 00:10:45,556
They found crates of these at a
nursery just a few miles out.

93
00:10:45,558 --> 00:10:48,392
Tomatoes, carrots, you name it.

94
00:10:48,394 --> 00:10:50,828
We can plant them right here.

95
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:54,465
Just need to finish
the expansion

96
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:57,535
and the wall needs to go up.

97
00:10:57,537 --> 00:11:01,806
Reg wanted
this community to grow.

98
00:11:01,808 --> 00:11:04,108
You did, too.

99
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,943
Has that changed?

100
00:11:10,983 --> 00:11:13,050
Everyone that's here
is here because of you.

101
00:11:15,954 --> 00:11:18,456
You need to show them
you're still here.

102
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,435
It hams my biscuits is all.

103
00:11:31,437 --> 00:11:34,505
And going by cubic feet, the
biggest building in the expansion

104
00:11:34,507 --> 00:11:36,474
and we're gonna
waste it on a church.

105
00:11:36,476 --> 00:11:38,342
Take out the benches,
that could be a lab,

106
00:11:38,344 --> 00:11:41,178
a machine shop, very least
a sweet-ass game room.

107
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,681
<i>Walled-in real estate</i>
<i>is at a premium here.</i>

108
00:11:43,683 --> 00:11:45,583
Thumpers just
shouldn't get dibs.

109
00:11:45,585 --> 00:11:48,552
Well, maybe we share
the church, you know?

110
00:11:48,554 --> 00:11:50,021
Do all that stuff
on different days.

111
00:11:50,023 --> 00:11:51,555
Hams my biscuits?

112
00:11:51,557 --> 00:11:55,226
Hams my biscuits.
That's all I heard.

113
00:11:55,228 --> 00:11:57,728
I mean, I have no idea
what you said after that.

114
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,064
- Going by cubic feet--
- <i>I was kidding.</i>

115
00:12:02,801 --> 00:12:04,735
<i>Are you okay, Dana?</i>

116
00:12:04,737 --> 00:12:07,705
- It's Denise.
- Denise, I'm sorry.

117
00:12:07,707 --> 00:12:10,007
I'm okay.

118
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:12,276
I'm the new doctor now.

119
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:13,978
<i>What's the aspirin for?</i>

120
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,248
- You're a doctor?
- <i>Are you?</i>

121
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,117
I'm sorry.
I, uh...

122
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:21,986
heard that story.

123
00:12:21,988 --> 00:12:23,587
Fair play.

124
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:25,690
<i>Listen, I'm a little</i>
<i>nervous here.</i>

125
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:27,992
I'm a psychiatrist.

126
00:12:27,994 --> 00:12:29,727
I went to med school.

127
00:12:29,729 --> 00:12:30,861
<i>I was even gonna be a surgeon,</i>

128
00:12:30,863 --> 00:12:32,763
but after the panic attacks,

129
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:35,266
I got really interested
in psychology.

130
00:12:35,268 --> 00:12:38,969
And...

131
00:12:38,971 --> 00:12:41,872
I think I'm really trying
to lower expectations here.

132
00:12:41,874 --> 00:12:43,340
Can you do this?

133
00:12:43,342 --> 00:12:46,377
Eugene, shut up.
She can do this.

134
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:48,145
<i>I'm all this town's got.</i>

135
00:12:48,147 --> 00:12:50,948
Pete didn't want me here.

136
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,718
But I'm here now

137
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,953
and I only kind of
want to throw up.

138
00:12:57,189 --> 00:12:59,090
<i>So why the aspirin?</i>

139
00:12:59,092 --> 00:13:02,460
Oh, Eugene and I were working on a
platform for another guard tower.

140
00:13:02,462 --> 00:13:05,329
<i>I got a little dizzy. You
know, I still get headaches.</i>

141
00:13:05,331 --> 00:13:06,697
Sit down, I'll take a look.

142
00:13:13,573 --> 00:13:15,506
You're my first patient.

143
00:13:15,508 --> 00:13:19,643
And with that symptom, I'm
pretty sure I can't kill you.

144
00:13:19,645 --> 00:13:22,880
I mean, it is possible if you miss,
like, a hematoma or something.

145
00:13:46,838 --> 00:13:48,839
Carl?

146
00:13:49,975 --> 00:13:51,609
What?

147
00:13:52,911 --> 00:13:55,246
You heard what I told
Deanna about your group.

148
00:13:55,248 --> 00:13:57,982
What do you want?

149
00:13:57,984 --> 00:13:59,784
It was about me,

150
00:13:59,786 --> 00:14:03,454
not you or your group.

151
00:14:03,456 --> 00:14:05,523
I know that now.

152
00:14:07,025 --> 00:14:08,759
I want to help.

153
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:12,429
<i>You tried to teach me</i>
<i>back at my church.</i>

154
00:14:12,431 --> 00:14:15,633
But I'm ready to learn now.

155
00:14:17,736 --> 00:14:20,337
I think you need
to tell everybody.

156
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:25,876
Yeah, I think you're right.

157
00:14:30,015 --> 00:14:31,916
Come by around 3:00.

158
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:33,951
We'll start with the machete.

159
00:15:36,348 --> 00:15:38,649
No! No! No!

160
00:15:46,274 --> 00:15:49,276
Richards.
What's going on in there?

161
00:15:52,715 --> 00:15:54,915
Oh, no.

162
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:56,484
No.

163
00:16:06,728 --> 00:16:08,395
Come on!

164
00:16:15,403 --> 00:16:16,871
I saw from upstairs.

165
00:16:16,873 --> 00:16:18,072
They're coming in from all over.

166
00:16:18,074 --> 00:16:20,741
You have to stay here
and keep Judith safe.

167
00:16:25,514 --> 00:16:28,048
- Please don't go.
- I have to go find Ron.

168
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,550
Oh, please.
Please don't go.

169
00:16:29,552 --> 00:16:31,785
- I'm gonna be right back, okay?
- Mom, no.

170
00:16:31,787 --> 00:16:33,687
No, you go put yourself
in the closet

171
00:16:33,689 --> 00:16:35,990
and you close the latch
just like I showed you.

172
00:16:39,728 --> 00:16:42,396
Shh. Shh. Shh.

173
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,444
Hi.

174
00:17:30,446 --> 00:17:32,613
Why didn't you just knock?

175
00:17:32,615 --> 00:17:35,316
I have these. Didn't
want them to have them.

176
00:17:41,022 --> 00:17:42,756
And I wanted
to say good-bye.

177
00:17:42,758 --> 00:17:44,959
Okay, watch the back door. Tell
me if you see them coming.

178
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:47,494
- I'm not staying.
- You're not going anywhere.

179
00:17:47,496 --> 00:17:50,598
Sit down. You're helping
me protect Judith.

180
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,633
They're not getting
inside this house.

181
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,376
We're not gonna let them.

182
00:18:05,814 --> 00:18:07,514
Did you see them?

183
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,784
They're just people.

184
00:18:12,621 --> 00:18:16,123
This place
is too big to protect.

185
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:19,026
There are too many blind spots.

186
00:18:19,028 --> 00:18:20,894
That's how
we were able to--

187
00:18:20,896 --> 00:18:24,264
They got in the walls,
but they're gonna die.

188
00:18:26,134 --> 00:18:27,701
All of them.

189
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:33,774
Don't tell me
good-bye.

190
00:18:41,883 --> 00:18:44,018
Okay.

191
00:18:47,122 --> 00:18:49,023
I won't.

192
00:19:33,301 --> 00:19:35,202
<i>No, please. Please don't.</i>

193
00:19:35,204 --> 00:19:37,271
<i>No, please.</i>
<i>Please...</i>

194
00:19:37,273 --> 00:19:38,706
Go away!

195
00:19:42,977 --> 00:19:46,080
Oh, God.

196
00:19:47,082 --> 00:19:49,283
Shh.

197
00:19:54,957 --> 00:19:59,026
Shh. Shh.

198
00:20:32,928 --> 00:20:34,928
Shit.

199
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,598
Come on.
Come on.

200
00:21:28,758 --> 00:21:31,059
Holly!

201
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:32,594
We need the operating
table prepped.

202
00:21:32,596 --> 00:21:35,430
She's lost a lot of blood.
Come on, come on, come on.

203
00:21:35,432 --> 00:21:38,066
- How many people are out there?
- I don't know, there's a lot.

204
00:21:38,068 --> 00:21:40,001
Rosita, you know
how to stick an IV?

205
00:21:40,003 --> 00:21:42,604
I'm on it.
Here, hand me tape.

206
00:21:42,606 --> 00:21:44,272
- Got it. - What about the air horn?
What's happening?

207
00:21:44,274 --> 00:21:46,741
I don't know.
I need to help.

208
00:21:46,743 --> 00:21:48,910
- I need to try.
- I know.

209
00:21:48,912 --> 00:21:51,479
Denise, I'm gonna
have to go, too.

210
00:21:52,948 --> 00:21:54,382
So do I.

211
00:21:54,384 --> 00:21:56,151
You got dizzy swinging a hammer.

212
00:21:56,153 --> 00:21:57,419
Somebody's got
to guard this place.

213
00:21:57,421 --> 00:21:59,521
- You can handle it.
- I can't!

214
00:21:59,523 --> 00:22:01,890
I also believe my services would
be best rendered right very here.

215
00:22:01,892 --> 00:22:03,625
- What?
- I also believe my services--

216
00:22:03,627 --> 00:22:05,427
Shut up! You're safe here.
Come on.

217
00:22:40,596 --> 00:22:42,130
What happened?

218
00:22:42,132 --> 00:22:45,567
Someone, a group,
they got inside the walls.

219
00:22:45,569 --> 00:22:47,168
They're killing people.

220
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,270
<i>We need to get in there.</i>

221
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,541
<i>You coming?</i>

222
00:22:57,613 --> 00:22:59,147
Hide.

223
00:23:21,237 --> 00:23:22,537
Quick...

224
00:23:24,573 --> 00:23:26,174
or slow?

225
00:23:27,977 --> 00:23:30,445
Leave.

226
00:23:30,447 --> 00:23:31,980
Please.

227
00:23:34,316 --> 00:23:36,084
Gonna be slow.

228
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,960
I could have stopped him.

229
00:23:45,962 --> 00:23:48,196
- The others back?
- No.

230
00:23:48,198 --> 00:23:50,265
- It's happening out there.
- <i>They're doing it now?</i>

231
00:23:50,267 --> 00:23:52,300
<i>We had to.</i>

232
00:23:52,302 --> 00:23:55,303
- These people don't have guns.
- <i>I could have stopped him.</i>

233
00:23:55,305 --> 00:23:57,939
- If they had guns, they'd be using them.
- Did you hear me?

234
00:23:57,941 --> 00:24:00,208
<i>We have to get to the
armory before they do.</i>

235
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:02,844
<i>If we keep moving,</i>
<i>this might work.</i>

236
00:24:02,846 --> 00:24:04,245
You don't have to kill people.

237
00:24:04,247 --> 00:24:07,649
- Of course we do.
- <i>Carol!</i>

238
00:24:07,651 --> 00:24:10,018
You don't like it.

239
00:24:13,255 --> 00:24:16,124
I'm gonna get to the armory
and I need your help.

240
00:24:21,597 --> 00:24:23,164
<i>Mom!</i>

241
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:25,600
Oh, God.
Spencer.

242
00:24:25,602 --> 00:24:27,335
Thank God.

243
00:24:27,337 --> 00:24:28,903
Thank God.

244
00:24:28,905 --> 00:24:31,139
We need to get inside.

245
00:24:31,141 --> 00:24:33,875
I can't go in there.
I don't have a gun.

246
00:24:33,877 --> 00:24:35,510
I don't know how to fight.

247
00:24:35,512 --> 00:24:38,324
If I go inside, I'll just be another
person who's got to be saved.

248
00:24:39,184 --> 00:24:43,518
Best thing that I can do
for everyone in there

249
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,853
is to stay out here.

250
00:24:47,223 --> 00:24:49,157
- Keep her safe.
- I will.

251
00:25:19,955 --> 00:25:21,990
<i>What's happening with her?</i>

252
00:25:21,992 --> 00:25:24,359
She's bleeding internally.

253
00:25:24,361 --> 00:25:27,729
Probably severed
her femoral artery.

254
00:25:27,731 --> 00:25:29,664
She's dying.

255
00:25:29,666 --> 00:25:32,367
Okay, so the artery's severed.
Can it be fixed?

256
00:25:32,369 --> 00:25:34,335
Maybe by a surgeon.

257
00:25:34,337 --> 00:25:35,937
You were gonna be a surgeon.

258
00:25:35,939 --> 00:25:37,338
But I'm not.

259
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,607
She was protecting this place.

260
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:42,443
She was guarding us. That's why
we're here, for each other.

261
00:25:44,413 --> 00:25:46,781
You're afraid?

262
00:25:46,783 --> 00:25:49,117
I don't care.
Help her.

263
00:25:50,419 --> 00:25:53,688
Try!
Help her!

264
00:25:56,026 --> 00:25:58,359
You don't want to be a coward.

265
00:25:58,361 --> 00:26:00,395
I know.

266
00:26:08,637 --> 00:26:10,872
I need an abdominal binder.
We're gonna pull the knife.

267
00:26:10,874 --> 00:26:12,707
Okay. Okay.

268
00:26:18,013 --> 00:26:21,482
Okay. Okay. Come on.

269
00:26:31,227 --> 00:26:33,961
Shit!

270
00:26:38,401 --> 00:26:41,302
Please, man.
Please don't kill me, man.

271
00:26:41,304 --> 00:26:44,105
Please. Help me, please. My leg.

272
00:26:55,918 --> 00:26:58,453
Come inside.

273
00:26:58,455 --> 00:26:59,954
I can keep you safe.

274
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:08,430
No.

275
00:27:08,432 --> 00:27:10,432
Ron.

276
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:16,037
Carl, come on!

277
00:27:26,382 --> 00:27:28,416
<i>Mom.</i>

278
00:27:28,418 --> 00:27:31,186
<i>Mom, you in?</i>

279
00:27:38,527 --> 00:27:40,795
Lock it.
Be brave.

280
00:27:58,481 --> 00:28:01,516
Stay outside, Ron!

281
00:28:10,493 --> 00:28:11,993
No!

282
00:29:04,673 --> 00:29:06,707
Good catch, Aphid.

283
00:29:09,644 --> 00:29:12,012
Come on.
Leave him.

284
00:29:12,014 --> 00:29:13,714
No.

285
00:29:19,087 --> 00:29:21,222
Hey, Aphid, where'd
you get the gun?

286
00:29:32,701 --> 00:29:34,568
You're dead.

287
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,284
Please don't kill me.

288
00:30:25,954 --> 00:30:29,156
It's okay.
Anybody else down here?

289
00:30:30,892 --> 00:30:32,860
- Olivia!
- No.

290
00:30:32,862 --> 00:30:34,895
No, I'm the only one.

291
00:30:41,102 --> 00:30:43,037
Come here.

292
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,705
Now.

293
00:30:47,075 --> 00:30:49,243
You barricade that door
behind me once I leave.

294
00:30:49,245 --> 00:30:51,645
Do you know how to shoot a gun?

295
00:30:51,647 --> 00:30:53,547
Stand here.

296
00:30:53,549 --> 00:30:55,916
Finger here.
Aim there.

297
00:30:55,918 --> 00:30:57,651
One of them comes
through that door,

298
00:30:57,653 --> 00:30:59,934
you squeeze and you don't stop
till they're on the ground.

299
00:31:11,132 --> 00:31:12,866
How did you learn
how to do that?

300
00:31:14,536 --> 00:31:16,870
From a cheese maker.

301
00:31:23,244 --> 00:31:25,245
We're freeing you.

302
00:31:25,247 --> 00:31:27,414
You're trapped.

303
00:31:27,416 --> 00:31:31,085
You need to know, people
don't belong here anymore.

304
00:31:42,497 --> 00:31:44,631
- Carol?
- Maggie!

305
00:31:49,671 --> 00:31:52,239
- Here.
- I--

306
00:31:52,241 --> 00:31:54,808
I'm not very good
with guns. I--

307
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,744
Me neither.

308
00:32:54,836 --> 00:32:56,670
You.

309
00:32:56,672 --> 00:32:58,305
You live here?

310
00:33:07,649 --> 00:33:10,050
Leave.

311
00:33:11,619 --> 00:33:14,288
My people have guns.

312
00:33:17,492 --> 00:33:19,126
Yours don't.

313
00:33:20,462 --> 00:33:24,064
They may be aiming rifles
at you right now.

314
00:33:25,266 --> 00:33:27,267
Eyes at the scopes.

315
00:33:27,269 --> 00:33:29,236
Fingers on the trigger.

316
00:33:30,905 --> 00:33:33,540
Boom.

317
00:33:33,542 --> 00:33:35,175
It's gonna happen any second now

318
00:33:35,177 --> 00:33:37,778
unless you get the hell out of
here and you don't ever come back.

319
00:33:39,881 --> 00:33:43,150
You keep choosing this life,

320
00:33:43,152 --> 00:33:44,985
you will die.

321
00:33:47,055 --> 00:33:49,323
We didn't choose.

322
00:36:46,356 --> 00:36:48,055
Come on, Holly.

323
00:37:19,354 --> 00:37:21,289
Denise, you tried.

324
00:37:21,291 --> 00:37:22,857
You are a doctor.

325
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:26,227
Just go see
if it's over out there

326
00:37:26,229 --> 00:37:27,929
and if...

327
00:37:29,965 --> 00:37:32,133
Please go, all of you.

328
00:37:32,135 --> 00:37:35,169
- Okay, but I just--
- Good. Go.

329
00:37:45,814 --> 00:37:47,682
All I was gonna say is...

330
00:37:49,084 --> 00:37:52,186
ahem, make sure
you get her brain.

331
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:06,567
What happened today,

332
00:38:06,569 --> 00:38:08,302
that's what it's like out there?

333
00:38:08,304 --> 00:38:10,071
Pretty much.

334
00:38:10,073 --> 00:38:12,139
How do you--

335
00:38:12,141 --> 00:38:15,643
how do you just live
knowing that's the world?

336
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:22,917
This group,

337
00:38:22,919 --> 00:38:25,052
Abraham, and this place.

338
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:29,690
Make sure you got something
worth dying for.

339
00:38:54,049 --> 00:38:55,750
We're still here.

340
00:38:57,319 --> 00:38:59,086
Not all of us.

341
00:39:15,405 --> 00:39:17,238
Enid?

342
00:39:19,074 --> 00:39:20,808
Enid?

343
00:41:29,337 --> 00:41:31,572
You can't, can you?

344
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:37,211
You should've.

345
00:41:50,125 --> 00:41:51,992
I'm sorry.

346
