00:00:00,374 --> 00:00:03,325
<i>Previously on
AMC's The Walking Dead...</i>

2
00:00:03,445 --> 00:00:05,620
<i>We're gonna have
Daryl leading them away.</i>

3
00:00:05,737 --> 00:00:06,795
<i>20 miles more.</i>

4
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:08,820
<i>I'll take a car
and ride next to him.</i>

5
00:00:08,921 --> 00:00:10,154
It can't just be him.

6
00:00:10,256 --> 00:00:11,736
You doing this
cuz you wanna die?

7
00:00:11,856 --> 00:00:13,244
No.

8
00:00:13,364 --> 00:00:15,493
We don't need to go
looking for people anymore.

9
00:00:15,594 --> 00:00:16,661
<i>Feel different about it?</i>

10
00:00:16,762 --> 00:00:17,996
Yeah. I do.

11
00:00:18,097 --> 00:00:19,564
<i>What's going on back there?</i>

12
00:00:19,665 --> 00:00:20,999
<i>Half of them broke off!</i>

13
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,334
<i>They're going toward Alexandria!
You keep going!</i>

14
00:00:23,435 --> 00:00:24,335
<i>What is it?</i>

15
00:00:24,436 --> 00:00:25,570
Keep moving. I'll catch up.

16
00:00:25,671 --> 00:00:27,372
Hee ya!
<i>Abraham!</i>

17
00:00:27,473 --> 00:00:28,373
I'm just livin' darlin'.
Woo!

18
00:00:28,474 --> 00:00:30,008
Just like you.

19
00:00:36,749 --> 00:00:38,283
<i>All right.</i>

20
00:00:38,285 --> 00:00:40,084
<i>That's 20?</i>

21
00:00:40,086 --> 00:00:42,420
<i>It will be.
642 is a mile ahead.</i>

22
00:00:42,422 --> 00:00:44,923
<i>We gotta put distance between
us and them before the turnoff.</i>

23
00:00:44,925 --> 00:00:46,824
<i>So floor it.</i>

24
00:00:46,826 --> 00:00:49,260
<i>All right,
try to keep up.</i>

25
00:00:49,262 --> 00:00:51,396
<i>Daryl, have you
looked at this car?</i>

26
00:00:51,398 --> 00:00:53,998
<i>Believe me, we
want to get back there, too.</i>

27
00:02:22,688 --> 00:02:25,089
Leave it.

28
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:27,392
Just gonna give it
a last little polish.

29
00:02:29,194 --> 00:02:31,095
What the hell
you got to grin about?

30
00:02:31,097 --> 00:02:32,697
We won, darlin'.

31
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:36,467
There could be more.

32
00:02:39,339 --> 00:02:40,938
Screw it.

34
00:05:02,694 --> 00:05:04,628
Sasha?

35
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,096
Abraham, are you there?

36
00:06:45,263 --> 00:06:46,763
You found us, okay?

37
00:06:46,765 --> 00:06:48,532
Here we are.

38
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:50,367
We earned what we took.

39
00:06:53,972 --> 00:06:57,341
Probably just another
soldier from one of the outposts.

40
00:06:58,576 --> 00:07:00,277
Probably hates him, too.

41
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,582
You know how to use one?

42
00:07:05,584 --> 00:07:07,517
Yeah.

43
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,086
Never liked using them to hunt.

44
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:14,424
We pick up Patty
and we're gone, okay?

45
00:07:14,426 --> 00:07:16,593
This is the last day
we gotta live like this.

46
00:07:26,104 --> 00:07:28,905
Get up.

47
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,808
Hey, get up.

48
00:07:34,546 --> 00:07:37,948
We're moving.
Here's the deal.

49
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,784
You don't say shit
and I don't kill you.

50
00:07:40,786 --> 00:07:42,252
I ain't who you think.

51
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:45,622
Say something else.

52
00:07:45,624 --> 00:07:47,257
Go ahead.

53
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,731
Follow them.

54
00:08:03,174 --> 00:08:05,409
Here, drink the rest.

55
00:08:07,412 --> 00:08:10,013
- We should save it.
- We'll find some more.

56
00:08:10,015 --> 00:08:11,314
Drink.

57
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:13,450
You're supposed
to stay hydrated.

58
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:15,252
It all works together.

59
00:08:15,254 --> 00:08:16,787
Yeah, it does.

60
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,368
Have it.

61
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:34,938
We don't need you falling down.

62
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,406
Drink.

63
00:08:40,945 --> 00:08:43,980
They find us, maybe
we give you to them,

64
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,949
they let us call it even.

65
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:48,251
You see,
we're reasonable people.

66
00:08:48,253 --> 00:08:50,654
Everybody's got their code.

67
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:54,057
You feel you gotta kneel,
that's fair enough.

68
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:55,992
We don't.

69
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,394
Let's go.

70
00:09:08,206 --> 00:09:10,006
I can't believe we're back.

71
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,842
It's not home anymore,

72
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:13,910
but it's better
than where we were.

73
00:09:13,912 --> 00:09:15,912
This is a pit stop.

74
00:09:15,914 --> 00:09:18,715
We pick up Patty,
nothing more than that.

75
00:09:20,485 --> 00:09:23,320
How'd you do it?

76
00:09:23,322 --> 00:09:24,788
You saw where we left the truck?

77
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,590
Mm-hmm.

78
00:09:26,592 --> 00:09:30,527
We opened the valve and drove all
the way in from Farmview Road.

79
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:33,296
Ran from the tree line
till we got to the pavement.

80
00:09:34,632 --> 00:09:36,433
Lit up a matchbook
from the Sweetwater

81
00:09:36,435 --> 00:09:38,335
and dropped it in on the trail.

82
00:09:38,337 --> 00:09:41,404
Then we just ran for the car.

83
00:09:41,406 --> 00:09:44,140
Got in and the dead
ones were there.

84
00:09:44,142 --> 00:09:47,143
They were beating
on the hood, and then...

85
00:09:47,145 --> 00:09:49,846
and then boom!

86
00:09:49,848 --> 00:09:53,850
Knocked 'em on their asses
and I took an axe to each one.

87
00:09:53,852 --> 00:09:56,353
Then we just watched it go up.

88
00:09:56,355 --> 00:09:59,523
No more moans, no
more of that wailing.

89
00:09:59,525 --> 00:10:03,226
It was just the fire,
just burning them all away.

90
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:06,496
You did all this?

91
00:10:06,498 --> 00:10:08,064
It was right at the start.

92
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,066
Everything stopped...
the TV, the radio.

93
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:13,503
We were here.
The forest was full of them.

94
00:10:13,505 --> 00:10:15,438
And the other ones in town,
they were drawn to it.

95
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,960
They just walked
right into the flames.

96
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:20,777
We got most of them.

97
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:23,713
Thought we ended it for us,
and she was in DC.

98
00:10:23,715 --> 00:10:27,417
We thought everyone was fighting
them wherever they were.

99
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:30,053
Yeah, we thought that was
what everybody was doing.

100
00:10:30,055 --> 00:10:31,855
Fighting it.

101
00:10:31,857 --> 00:10:33,657
That we'd all win together.

102
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,028
We were stupid.

103
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,463
Y'all don't think you're
being stupid right now?

104
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,971
Are you saying
I should kill you?

105
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:53,677
I mean it, are you gonna try
and pull something on us?

106
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:56,479
Are we just being thick here
by not removing all doubt?

107
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,818
Right now, by me
not pulling this trigger,

108
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,354
is that a mistake?

109
00:11:04,356 --> 00:11:07,290
I'm serious.
I really wanna know.

110
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,559
You made a choice
to kill for someone else,

111
00:11:09,561 --> 00:11:12,829
to have them own you for a roof
over your head and three squares,

112
00:11:12,831 --> 00:11:16,132
so maybe I'm not considering
all aspects here.

113
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:19,169
You tell me, am I being stupid?

114
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:23,940
No.

115
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:27,043
Look, I got somewhere to be.

116
00:11:27,045 --> 00:11:28,979
We can make a deal.
I can help you out.

117
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:32,015
You're one of them.

118
00:11:32,017 --> 00:11:35,352
You're hurt and you're alone
and you'd say anything.

119
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:42,525
We should've never trusted
you people to begin with.

120
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:44,260
Go on.

121
00:11:44,262 --> 00:11:46,963
Keep moving.

122
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,343
Son of a bitch.

123
00:12:15,126 --> 00:12:16,593
Patty.

124
00:12:19,463 --> 00:12:20,697
She could be...

125
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,005
No, she's gone.

126
00:12:35,112 --> 00:12:36,980
Then we make another plan.

127
00:12:36,982 --> 00:12:38,915
Yeah, we get out of here,
that's the plan.

128
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:40,483
Then that's the plan.

129
00:12:40,485 --> 00:12:42,719
You guys didn't have
to do this for me.

130
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:46,056
It was the right
thing for all of us.

131
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:48,425
This was the right thing?

132
00:12:48,427 --> 00:12:50,160
Even if just you guys
went back now,

133
00:12:50,162 --> 00:12:52,595
if you just told them
that it was me...

134
00:12:52,597 --> 00:12:54,497
No, we'll find a way.

135
00:12:54,499 --> 00:12:56,566
- Just think about it.
- No.

136
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,335
Look, maybe we don't get as
far, but we'll get... hey!

137
00:12:59,337 --> 00:13:00,670
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Tina, hey!

138
00:13:00,672 --> 00:13:01,838
<i>Hey, baby sister, look at me.</i>

139
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,206
Hey, stop!
No!

140
00:13:04,443 --> 00:13:06,376
Don't!
We need that, please!

141
00:13:28,132 --> 00:13:29,899
Sasha, Abraham, are you there?

142
00:14:39,363 --> 00:14:41,718
There, it's clear.

143
00:14:41,838 --> 00:14:43,772
His bike's gone.

144
00:14:47,576 --> 00:14:49,444
These are his shells.

145
00:14:49,446 --> 00:14:51,446
He fired at 'em, got away.

146
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,484
He caught a good bounce.

147
00:14:58,254 --> 00:14:59,721
There aren't
enough people around

148
00:14:59,723 --> 00:15:02,524
to just wait around
for somebody to ambush.

149
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,325
And they couldn't have
just been watching us,

150
00:15:04,327 --> 00:15:06,361
not with what we were doing.

151
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:10,298
Nah, they were looking to chew
up someone in particular.

152
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,400
Whoever the hell they were.

153
00:15:16,172 --> 00:15:17,472
Daryl, you copy?

154
00:15:21,243 --> 00:15:23,144
Daryl?

155
00:15:23,146 --> 00:15:26,447
Dollars to doughnuts, he's on
his way back to Alexandria now.

156
00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:28,950
- He wouldn't leave us behind.
- He already did.

157
00:15:28,952 --> 00:15:30,685
But he came back.

158
00:15:32,888 --> 00:15:35,156
So we go look for him.

159
00:15:35,158 --> 00:15:37,926
The best way to find a
tracker is to stay put.

160
00:15:37,928 --> 00:15:39,427
Let him find you.

161
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:40,662
You just want us to sit here

162
00:15:40,664 --> 00:15:43,331
with our precious leathers
in our hands?

163
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,465
No.

164
00:16:11,493 --> 00:16:13,728
Don't.

165
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,163
What?

166
00:16:15,165 --> 00:16:16,831
You're smarter than that.

167
00:16:18,467 --> 00:16:20,835
We don't need
to leave bread crumbs.

168
00:17:28,939 --> 00:17:32,674
How come gorgeous over here
is still standing?

169
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,742
He can't get out.

170
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,148
It's locked.
We're fine.

171
00:17:44,687 --> 00:17:47,588
Stand watch or sleep?
Your choice.

172
00:17:50,626 --> 00:17:53,428
I'll take the former.

173
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,563
Do a little shopping, maybe.

174
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,174
Can't sleep?

175
00:18:42,945 --> 00:18:44,245
What does it look like?

176
00:18:44,247 --> 00:18:46,147
I just wanted to know
if it was a choice.

177
00:18:49,152 --> 00:18:51,052
You have no idea how much

178
00:18:51,054 --> 00:18:54,022
I want to release that thing
from this plane of existence.

179
00:19:03,198 --> 00:19:04,932
This our new home?

180
00:19:08,971 --> 00:19:12,340
Should we give him a name?

181
00:19:12,342 --> 00:19:14,175
You got yourself into this.

182
00:19:16,211 --> 00:19:19,680
<i>I was driving that car solo
until you chose to come with.</i>

183
00:19:19,682 --> 00:19:21,682
Oh, I didn't have
a choice there.

184
00:19:21,684 --> 00:19:23,518
Tell me why.

185
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,520
<i>You going stag
was not an option.</i>

186
00:19:25,522 --> 00:19:28,322
Tell me why.

187
00:19:32,561 --> 00:19:35,329
You were out of control
for a good while there.

188
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:39,567
Just about took my arm off
on the road to paradise.

189
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:41,903
- You remember that?
- I do.

190
00:19:43,939 --> 00:19:46,374
- I'm in control now.
- Me, too.

191
00:19:46,376 --> 00:19:48,509
<i>That's why you wanna
kill that walker?</i>

192
00:19:48,511 --> 00:19:50,745
The one down the street?

193
00:19:50,747 --> 00:19:52,580
The guys in the car?

194
00:19:52,582 --> 00:19:54,315
'Cause you're in control.

195
00:19:54,317 --> 00:19:57,452
'Cause loose ends
make my ass itch.

196
00:20:00,155 --> 00:20:03,991
If I have not gotten
my psyche situated straight,

197
00:20:03,993 --> 00:20:07,161
it's because the shit's
continually been hitting the fan

198
00:20:07,163 --> 00:20:08,830
without respite.

199
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,465
Oh, there's been respite.
There was a party.

200
00:20:10,467 --> 00:20:11,933
<i>Oh, I remember that.</i>

201
00:20:11,935 --> 00:20:14,402
You had the time
of your life there.

202
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:19,874
You don't have to throw
yourself out of a moving car...

203
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,744
to feel like
you're calling the ball.

204
00:20:23,746 --> 00:20:25,346
<i>That's easy.</i>

205
00:20:25,348 --> 00:20:26,681
<i>You jump out of an airplane,</i>

206
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,983
<i>you don't have
choices after that.</i>

207
00:20:28,985 --> 00:20:31,252
<i>Maybe you play some
chicken with the ground,</i>

208
00:20:31,254 --> 00:20:35,590
<i>but you pull the rip
cord, you live.</i>

209
00:20:35,592 --> 00:20:38,759
But if you have
a roof over your head,

210
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:41,529
you have food, you have walls...

211
00:20:43,298 --> 00:20:45,032
you have choices.

212
00:20:47,536 --> 00:20:51,272
And without walkers and bullets

213
00:20:51,274 --> 00:20:54,675
and shit hitting the fan,

214
00:20:54,677 --> 00:20:58,112
you're accountable for them.

215
00:20:58,114 --> 00:21:01,682
<i>I mean, hell, you're
always accountable.</i>

216
00:21:01,684 --> 00:21:05,153
<i>It's just with
all that other noise,</i>

217
00:21:05,155 --> 00:21:08,089
you know people won't notice.

218
00:21:25,274 --> 00:21:28,075
Stand watch or sleep.

219
00:21:28,077 --> 00:21:29,877
The former.

220
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,415
Straight through the night.

221
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:37,118
We'll reassess in the morning.

222
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,719
What do you mean?

223
00:21:38,721 --> 00:21:40,655
What the hell we're doing here.

224
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,010
Drop the gun.
Drop it.

225
00:22:08,782 --> 00:22:10,316
Give it to me.

226
00:22:13,921 --> 00:22:17,824
I came all this way.
What you got for the duffel?

227
00:22:17,826 --> 00:22:20,630
You put me through too much
shit just to give it back.

228
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,395
Principle of the thing.

229
00:22:22,397 --> 00:22:24,597
What you got besides this gun?

230
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:26,099
Nothing.

231
00:22:28,602 --> 00:22:30,403
What was that thing
you were carving?

232
00:22:35,676 --> 00:22:37,305
- My grandfather taught me how...
<i>- Don't care.</i>

233
00:22:37,425 --> 00:22:38,626
It'll do.

234
00:22:42,417 --> 00:22:45,158
Take it.
It's all there.

235
00:22:47,361 --> 00:22:49,463
Good luck.
You're gonna need it.

236
00:23:11,018 --> 00:23:13,053
Let's end this.

237
00:23:13,055 --> 00:23:15,188
It's ours.

238
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,990
We earned what we took.

239
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:19,659
<i>You're gonna
return what you took.</i>

240
00:23:19,661 --> 00:23:22,629
<i>You're gonna pay for the gas
it took to come out here</i>

241
00:23:22,631 --> 00:23:24,798
and for all the time
these men took out.

242
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,200
It's over.
You know the rules.

243
00:23:27,202 --> 00:23:30,170
Your rules are batshit!

244
00:23:30,172 --> 00:23:32,773
We're not going back, Wade.
We're done kneeling!

245
00:23:32,775 --> 00:23:34,674
Don't change the subject,
asshole.

246
00:23:47,989 --> 00:23:49,756
Come on.
Hey, that way.

247
00:23:49,758 --> 00:23:51,558
Come on.
Go, go, go.

248
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,059
Go.

249
00:23:53,061 --> 00:23:54,528
Get up.

250
00:24:14,482 --> 00:24:16,516
Hey.

251
00:24:16,518 --> 00:24:17,984
Take it.

252
00:24:21,756 --> 00:24:23,623
<i>Eyes open.</i>

253
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:26,593
<i>You cover your quadrant.
Go to alpha channel.</i>

254
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:39,005
Love you, Sher.

255
00:24:39,007 --> 00:24:41,875
You didn't have to for me.

256
00:25:01,429 --> 00:25:03,330
Wade, I'm bit!

257
00:25:03,332 --> 00:25:05,699
<i>Wade, I'm bit!</i>

258
00:25:08,402 --> 00:25:10,036
- Take it off me.
- Damn it.

259
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:12,038
Do it!
Just take it off!

260
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,544
<i>I'll get your watch after.</i>

261
00:25:27,221 --> 00:25:29,489
<i>All right, that's it.</i>

262
00:25:29,491 --> 00:25:31,057
<i>Time to go home.</i>

263
00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:32,592
<i>Cam got a boo-boo.</i>

264
00:25:32,594 --> 00:25:34,494
<i>Are you sure?</i>

265
00:25:34,496 --> 00:25:38,498
<i>Oh, yeah. He only
wanted to take this so far.</i>

266
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,968
<i>And he only wants ass
that's willing, you know?</i>

267
00:25:47,308 --> 00:25:49,776
Come on, Cam.
Let's walk it off.

268
00:26:03,925 --> 00:26:05,425
We thought you were with them.

269
00:26:07,361 --> 00:26:10,563
<i>We knock you over the
head, tie you up,</i>

270
00:26:10,565 --> 00:26:12,365
threaten to kill you...

271
00:26:13,868 --> 00:26:15,969
why the hell did you come back?

272
00:26:19,173 --> 00:26:21,141
Maybe I'm stupid, too.

273
00:27:30,339 --> 00:27:32,840
Well, howdy, gentlemen.

274
00:28:07,321 --> 00:28:09,677
RPG.

275
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:06,665
<i>Where do you get that?</i>

276
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:08,366
It is the fruit

277
00:31:08,368 --> 00:31:11,236
of some off-the-chart
stupidity.

278
00:31:12,438 --> 00:31:15,774
Some grade-A,
butt steak idiocy.

279
00:31:16,891 --> 00:31:19,077
Self-awareness
is a beautiful thing.

280
00:31:19,897 --> 00:31:21,846
Yes, it is.

281
00:31:24,152 --> 00:31:26,051
You see, I know this group

282
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:28,353
<i>and I know Rick.</i>

283
00:31:28,355 --> 00:31:30,555
<i>And whatever happened
back there is being managed</i>

284
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:32,190
and kicked right up
into its own ass

285
00:31:32,192 --> 00:31:34,059
one way or another.
I know that.

286
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:38,063
We got beer...

287
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:41,566
and air conditioning...

288
00:31:43,469 --> 00:31:44,736
and walls.

289
00:31:45,949 --> 00:31:50,175
<i>The table is set
for the rest of our lives,</i>

290
00:31:50,177 --> 00:31:53,545
<i>and I hope those years
to be long and fruitful.</i>

291
00:31:53,547 --> 00:31:55,413
I see that time before me...

292
00:31:57,631 --> 00:32:01,734
and I've been feeling the
urge to make some plays...

293
00:32:01,736 --> 00:32:05,638
<i>before the great cosmic Pete comes
to cut my throat unceremoniously</i>

294
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,041
<i>and I gurgle my last breath.</i>

295
00:32:09,043 --> 00:32:12,645
Well, things are gonna go on
for a while before that,

296
00:32:12,647 --> 00:32:15,548
and that hadn't
occurred to me before.

297
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:18,050
I've been kind of living
check to check on that point.

298
00:32:22,122 --> 00:32:25,391
I like the way
you call bullshit, Sasha.

299
00:32:25,393 --> 00:32:28,794
<i>I believe I'd like to get to
know you a whole lot better.</i>

300
00:32:34,568 --> 00:32:36,602
That one of your plays?

301
00:32:41,141 --> 00:32:44,977
What makes you think
I want that?

302
00:32:49,249 --> 00:32:51,751
A man can tell.

303
00:32:56,289 --> 00:32:57,657
Well...

304
00:33:00,394 --> 00:33:03,195
...you got
some stuff to take care of.

305
00:33:04,731 --> 00:33:07,633
Yeah.

306
00:33:07,635 --> 00:33:09,402
I do.

307
00:33:20,981 --> 00:33:21,861
So you knew 'em?

308
00:33:21,957 --> 00:33:23,171
Still you thought I was one of them?

309
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:25,793
Where we were... we were
there since the beginning.

310
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,294
We still didn't know everyone.

311
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,163
Back when we first
threw in with them,

312
00:33:29,165 --> 00:33:31,131
it was as good
as a place as any.

313
00:33:31,133 --> 00:33:34,068
Then things got harder,
people got harder.

314
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:36,937
Human nature kicked in
and it became

315
00:33:36,939 --> 00:33:38,980
a truly unique kind of shitshow.

316
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,142
People will trade
anything for safety,

317
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,610
for knowing that they're safe.

318
00:33:43,612 --> 00:33:45,579
Everything.

319
00:33:45,581 --> 00:33:48,515
So they got nothing left
except just...

320
00:33:48,517 --> 00:33:50,250
existing.

321
00:33:50,252 --> 00:33:52,920
Hey, nobody's safe anymore.

322
00:33:52,922 --> 00:33:55,255
Can't promise
people that anyhow.

323
00:33:55,257 --> 00:33:57,558
You could promise the
people who want to hear it.

324
00:33:59,594 --> 00:34:01,328
Hey, Tina, hold up.

325
00:34:13,408 --> 00:34:15,509
Carla and Delly.

326
00:34:17,011 --> 00:34:18,645
That's them.

327
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:26,987
<i>Me and Tina used to babysit
them when they were kids.</i>

328
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:30,557
<i>Everyone said that they went
out north when it all started.</i>

329
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:31,925
<i>We didn't know.</i>

330
00:34:39,902 --> 00:34:42,002
I did this.

331
00:34:43,505 --> 00:34:45,472
We did this.

332
00:35:18,974 --> 00:35:21,708
I'm sorry!

333
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:24,912
I'm so sorry, baby.
We had to try.

334
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,181
<i>We had to try.
We had to.</i>

335
00:35:27,183 --> 00:35:29,950
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

336
00:35:29,952 --> 00:35:33,086
I'm sorry.

337
00:35:33,088 --> 00:35:34,621
I'm...

338
00:35:50,738 --> 00:35:52,372
Hey.

339
00:35:54,509 --> 00:35:56,210
How many walkers you killed?

340
00:35:58,646 --> 00:36:02,115
- Just answer the question.
- A lot.

341
00:36:02,117 --> 00:36:04,084
A couple dozen at least.

342
00:36:04,086 --> 00:36:06,420
How many people you killed?

343
00:36:06,422 --> 00:36:08,755
None.

344
00:36:08,757 --> 00:36:10,357
Why?

345
00:36:13,328 --> 00:36:16,196
Why haven't I killed anybody?

346
00:36:16,198 --> 00:36:19,633
Because if I did,
there'd be no going back.

347
00:36:21,269 --> 00:36:23,770
There'd be no going back
to how things were.

348
00:36:25,573 --> 00:36:27,641
I'm from a place

349
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:30,978
where people are
still like they were...

350
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,348
more or less, better or worse.

351
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,801
I can walk it from here.

352
00:36:54,803 --> 00:36:57,471
Till we meet up with my friends.

353
00:36:57,473 --> 00:37:00,407
They got a car.
You can ride with them.

354
00:37:00,409 --> 00:37:01,908
How many friends
you say there were?

355
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:05,512
I didn't.
There's two of 'em.

356
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:07,881
Where are they?

357
00:37:07,883 --> 00:37:10,517
<i>We're gonna find out.</i>

358
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:13,387
How do you know they even got away?
That they didn't get taken?

359
00:37:13,389 --> 00:37:15,188
I don't.

360
00:37:23,464 --> 00:37:25,666
Oh, damn it.

361
00:37:32,974 --> 00:37:34,641
I'm sorry.

362
00:37:37,078 --> 00:37:39,112
Give her the crossbow.

363
00:37:40,315 --> 00:37:42,749
You gonna go back?

364
00:37:42,751 --> 00:37:44,718
- You gonna be safe?
- Shut up.

365
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,453
Ain't nowhere safe no more.

366
00:37:46,455 --> 00:37:48,155
Give her the crossbow.

367
00:37:48,157 --> 00:37:50,457
You gonna kneel?

368
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,291
Patch yourself up.

369
00:38:28,796 --> 00:38:29,930
We're sorry.

370
00:38:31,232 --> 00:38:32,766
You're gonna be.

371
00:40:20,141 --> 00:40:22,209
Look at this.

372
00:40:27,548 --> 00:40:28,682
What?

373
00:40:31,352 --> 00:40:33,954
Nothing.

374
00:41:21,702 --> 00:41:23,837
Rick, you copy?

375
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,707
<i>Anybody?</i>

376
00:41:32,381 --> 00:41:34,147
<i>Say it again?</i>

377
00:41:36,552 --> 00:41:38,084
<i>Help.</i>

378
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,543
