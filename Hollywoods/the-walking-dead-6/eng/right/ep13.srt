Fear the walking dead,

5
-00:00:11,358 --> -00:00:09,325
Washington's spies,

6
-00:00:09,323 --> -00:00:07,290
and into the badlands.

7
-00:00:07,288 --> -00:00:05,656
Only on amc.

8
00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:05,420
They need our help.

9
00:00:14,863 --> 00:00:17,563
You are staying here.

10
00:00:34,444 --> 00:00:37,379
Damn it, Maggie, let's go!

11
00:00:38,514 --> 00:00:39,814
Not until it's done.

12
00:00:42,385 --> 00:00:45,586
- Stop!
- Or she's dead.

13
00:00:49,991 --> 00:00:53,492
Guns, knives on the ground
right now.

14
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:57,462
Nice jacket.

15
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,631
For a murderous bitch.

16
00:01:00,633 --> 00:01:02,666
Well, we'll take it off her
before we shoot her.

17
00:01:16,878 --> 00:01:19,012
It ain't on there right,
I can feel it. It ain't stopping.

18
00:01:19,014 --> 00:01:21,447
I'm getting it tighter.
Jesus, give me a second.

19
00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:22,981
Son of a bitch, you're cutting
off my circulation.

20
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:24,882
Well, sport, it's supposed to.

21
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:26,683
Hell was that?

22
00:01:31,555 --> 00:01:34,490
It's primo.

23
00:01:34,492 --> 00:01:36,792
Damn it, they've got him.
Give me the walkie.

24
00:01:36,794 --> 00:01:39,594
Babe, what's happening?

25
00:01:42,565 --> 00:01:44,731
Lower your gun, prick.

26
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:49,535
You, with the Colt python.

27
00:01:49,537 --> 00:01:51,970
All of you, lower your
weapons right now.

28
00:02:00,845 --> 00:02:03,879
Come on out. Let's talk.

29
00:02:03,881 --> 00:02:06,481
How many we got?

30
00:02:06,483 --> 00:02:08,483
Eight in sight.

31
00:02:08,485 --> 00:02:09,851
Too many.

32
00:02:09,853 --> 00:02:12,086
No, we can take 'em. We took more.

33
00:02:15,523 --> 00:02:18,558
We're not coming out,
but we will talk.

34
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,626
Names.

35
00:02:20,628 --> 00:02:22,494
Names!

36
00:02:22,496 --> 00:02:24,496
I'm Maggie, she's Carol.

37
00:02:24,498 --> 00:02:26,798
We've got a Carol
and a Maggie.

38
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,800
I'm thinking that's something
you want to chat about.

39
00:02:31,803 --> 00:02:34,571
Now, we're gonna work this out
right now,

40
00:02:34,573 --> 00:02:37,106
and it's going to go our way.

41
00:02:44,947 --> 00:02:48,548
You can see we have one of yours.

42
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,982
We'll trade.

43
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,551
I'm listening.

44
00:02:52,553 --> 00:02:54,719
First I want to talk to
Maggie and Carol,

45
00:02:54,721 --> 00:02:56,987
make sure they're all right.

46
00:02:56,989 --> 00:02:58,788
I'm gonna put you on.
You say you're fine.

47
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,689
I'll know if you try anything else.

48
00:03:00,691 --> 00:03:03,091
Rick, it's Carol.

49
00:03:03,093 --> 00:03:05,560
- I'm... I'm fine, but...
- now you.

50
00:03:05,562 --> 00:03:07,461
Rick, it's Maggie. We're both okay.

51
00:03:07,463 --> 00:03:09,029
- We'll figure thi...
- shut up.

52
00:03:09,031 --> 00:03:11,031
You have your proof. Let's talk.

53
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:15,502
Alright this is the deal
right here.

54
00:03:15,504 --> 00:03:19,739
Let 'em go, you can have
your guy back and live.

55
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,608
Two for one,
that's not much of a trade.

56
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,644
You don't have another choice

57
00:03:25,646 --> 00:03:28,980
or you would've done
something about it already.

58
00:03:28,982 --> 00:03:31,849
We have to get him back.

59
00:03:31,851 --> 00:03:33,817
Primo can take care of himself.

60
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:35,852
He can patch me up.

61
00:03:35,854 --> 00:03:38,521
I need him, thanks to that bitch.

62
00:03:39,923 --> 00:03:42,024
You lost your balls, Paula.

63
00:03:42,026 --> 00:03:44,493
You should've shot her in the
head so they could hear her die.

64
00:03:44,495 --> 00:03:46,695
If you could just shut up,
I'll solve this.

65
00:03:46,697 --> 00:03:47,829
Then make the deal or we go in.

66
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:49,831
She said shut up, so shut it.

67
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,532
You should be glad she doesn't have

68
00:03:51,534 --> 00:03:53,934
a sack of gonads to trip over.

69
00:03:53,936 --> 00:03:56,503
Look, I know you're
talking it over.

70
00:03:56,505 --> 00:03:58,004
It's a fair trade.

71
00:03:58,006 --> 00:04:01,841
Just come out, we do this,

72
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:03,909
we all walk away.

73
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,511
Smug prick.

74
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,546
He must think we're stupid.

75
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,080
That's a good thing.

76
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:14,784
Do we have a deal?

77
00:04:14,786 --> 00:04:16,952
I'll get back to you.

78
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:06,866
Move!

79
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,206
Turn.

80
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:22,913
Wait.

81
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:29,718
Omega, omega, saviors down.

82
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,920
Go to gamma, code "fire."

83
00:05:35,091 --> 00:05:37,624
Alpha channel is not clear.
We follow the protocol.

84
00:05:39,194 --> 00:05:41,194
Where the hell are you guys?

85
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:44,697
Out west of the...

86
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:47,633
15 mi... on... way.

87
00:05:47,635 --> 00:05:48,967
We're headed to the break point.

88
00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:51,769
Switch to theta channel,
same code.

89
00:05:51,771 --> 00:05:53,871
If I'm not there,
toggle to Alpha, listen in.

90
00:05:53,873 --> 00:05:56,006
Copy that.

91
00:06:01,113 --> 00:06:03,880
I hate this damn place.

92
00:06:03,882 --> 00:06:06,015
Safe house.

93
00:06:06,017 --> 00:06:07,850
There ain't nothing safe about it.

94
00:06:07,852 --> 00:06:09,985
This place is gonna save our asses.

95
00:06:24,732 --> 00:06:26,933
Get on the ground.

96
00:06:26,935 --> 00:06:28,701
You there.

97
00:06:34,674 --> 00:06:36,307
You, over there.

98
00:06:58,128 --> 00:07:00,929
You're wondering if
there's a way out of this.

99
00:07:00,931 --> 00:07:04,032
There isn't. Not unless I say so.

100
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:21,947
Paula, I need backup!

101
00:07:25,885 --> 00:07:28,186
I want to kill you both right now.

102
00:07:28,188 --> 00:07:29,820
It's taking all I have not to,

103
00:07:29,822 --> 00:07:31,254
so go ahead, I dare you,
try something.

104
00:07:31,256 --> 00:07:33,055
Just see what happens.

105
00:08:53,393 --> 00:08:55,260
When's the last time
anyone checked this place?

106
00:08:55,262 --> 00:08:57,262
It was fine a month ago.

107
00:08:57,264 --> 00:08:59,230
Sweetie, that was a month ago.
Shit hards quick.

108
00:08:59,232 --> 00:09:01,932
The guns have gone bye bye,
the food's gone bye bye,

109
00:09:01,934 --> 00:09:04,267
and we got growlers
up and down the halls.

110
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:06,302
Means people can get through, too.

111
00:09:06,304 --> 00:09:08,203
- Maybe we should get gone.
- Carol!

112
00:09:08,205 --> 00:09:09,771
- Yeah, Where the hell to?
- Nowhere.

113
00:09:09,773 --> 00:09:11,839
Got dead in the halls?
Free security.

114
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:14,107
Those assholes get here
before our people,

115
00:09:14,109 --> 00:09:16,042
the cold bloods will
buy us some time.

116
00:09:16,044 --> 00:09:18,110
Shut up.

117
00:09:18,112 --> 00:09:20,313
Jesus, it's bleeding.
It's not supposed to keep bleeding.

118
00:09:20,315 --> 00:09:23,115
- Molly, give me the rope.
- I'm not losing it.

119
00:09:23,117 --> 00:09:25,517
- I'm not.
- So you grind it out. Jesus, Donnie.

120
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,887
Screw you, 'chelle!
We have to get him back.

121
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:30,488
He can fix it.

122
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,923
- We have to, Paula.
- No.

123
00:09:32,925 --> 00:09:34,891
I saw them, you didn't.

124
00:09:34,893 --> 00:09:36,225
They took the place down,

125
00:09:36,227 --> 00:09:38,026
they got the guns,
they'll kill us, too.

126
00:09:38,028 --> 00:09:39,394
Hey!

127
00:09:39,396 --> 00:09:40,495
I'm not going down like that,

128
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,296
not after making it this far.

129
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:46,365
Hey!

130
00:09:49,102 --> 00:09:51,236
What?

131
00:09:51,238 --> 00:09:55,440
She's hyperventilating.
Somebody needs to take her gag off.

132
00:10:01,413 --> 00:10:04,448
She's a nervous little bird,
ain't she?

133
00:10:11,387 --> 00:10:12,855
Look at you.

134
00:10:14,555 --> 00:10:16,124
Bitch how did you make it this far?

135
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:20,494
Honey, you need to take some yoga
breaths and calm your ass down.

136
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:22,562
I can't...

137
00:10:36,107 --> 00:10:37,373
Oh.

138
00:10:38,508 --> 00:10:41,109
You're one of those.

139
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,222
What are you so afraid of?

140
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,095
Are you actually afraid to die?

141
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:13,634
All this and you're scared of
getting your ticket punched.

142
00:11:17,205 --> 00:11:20,139
It doesn't matter what happens to me.

143
00:11:22,275 --> 00:11:25,243
Just don't hurt Maggie.

144
00:11:25,245 --> 00:11:27,211
Don't hurt the baby.

145
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,190
Yeah, right.

146
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,560
She got a bun in the oven,
she doesn't look it.

147
00:11:44,562 --> 00:11:47,396
I'm only two months, i think.

148
00:11:49,031 --> 00:11:50,498
You're some kind of stupid,

149
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,000
getting knocked up
at a time like this.

150
00:11:53,002 --> 00:11:55,402
You think that's funny?

151
00:11:55,404 --> 00:11:59,072
When was it ever smart
to get knocked up?

152
00:11:59,074 --> 00:12:02,175
Women used to just die in childbirth.

153
00:12:02,177 --> 00:12:04,377
And they always thought
the world was gonna end.

154
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:07,413
Living through it, why would
you just give up?

155
00:12:07,415 --> 00:12:10,282
But are you gonna live through it?

156
00:12:12,218 --> 00:12:15,019
Anyway, that's cute.

157
00:12:15,021 --> 00:12:17,354
Babies are the point.

158
00:12:17,356 --> 00:12:19,622
Children are our future.

159
00:12:21,424 --> 00:12:24,659
Making bite size snacks for the dead.

160
00:12:27,195 --> 00:12:30,263
The point is to stay standing.

161
00:12:30,265 --> 00:12:32,231
No.

162
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:34,566
Walkers do that.

163
00:12:34,568 --> 00:12:37,235
I'm choosing something.

164
00:12:38,503 --> 00:12:41,104
That's right.

165
00:12:41,106 --> 00:12:43,139
You are.

166
00:12:43,141 --> 00:12:45,107
You did.

167
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,128
The baby.

168
00:13:17,568 --> 00:13:21,370
Honey, in case you haven't noticed,

169
00:13:21,372 --> 00:13:25,206
you've got bigger problems
than a little secondhand smoke.

170
00:13:27,175 --> 00:13:29,309
Molls.

171
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:37,416
Y'all are worse than a bunch

172
00:13:37,418 --> 00:13:41,353
of Evangelical second graders.

173
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:56,267
Those things'll kill you.

174
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,402
They already have.

175
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:02,239
I'm a dead woman walking.

176
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:06,543
Which puts us in exactly
the same boat.

177
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,658
Ah!

178
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,693
My arm feels like it's on fire.

179
00:14:27,695 --> 00:14:30,562
You pull that off,
you gonna be nothing but a spigot.

180
00:14:30,564 --> 00:14:33,164
- Okay, hold on.
- Agh!

181
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:36,567
Scout crew is coming.
They're 30 minutes out, maybe less.

182
00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:39,303
He doesn't have 30 minutes.

183
00:14:39,305 --> 00:14:42,172
His nerves are dying.

184
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:44,440
If he doesn't get medical help,
he's gonna lose his arm,

185
00:14:44,442 --> 00:14:47,643
maybe his life.

186
00:14:47,645 --> 00:14:51,179
I'm not a doctor, but my dad lost
his leg, and I know that much.

187
00:14:56,385 --> 00:14:59,486
Your man, primo, you think
he can help you?

188
00:15:02,556 --> 00:15:05,157
It's time to end this.

189
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:07,291
Talk to Rick.

190
00:15:10,161 --> 00:15:11,794
30 minutes.

191
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,709
You know my problem?

192
00:15:34,181 --> 00:15:36,815
She did this to me.

193
00:15:36,817 --> 00:15:38,683
She did it and she's just
sitting there

194
00:15:38,685 --> 00:15:40,685
right as rain, fully intact.

195
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:44,321
- Hey.
- No, you're not gonna make the trade.

196
00:15:44,323 --> 00:15:45,722
And we just do 'em both now.

197
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:50,326
No, we wait for the others.

198
00:15:50,328 --> 00:15:53,462
We have to be smart.
We need insurance.

199
00:15:53,464 --> 00:15:54,663
Then shoot her in the arm, too.

200
00:15:54,665 --> 00:15:57,232
No.

201
00:15:57,234 --> 00:16:01,235
You really gonna stick up for
some gutless bitch over me?

202
00:16:04,472 --> 00:16:07,774
- God damn it!
- Shut up.

203
00:16:07,776 --> 00:16:09,742
Don't push me, Paula.

204
00:16:09,744 --> 00:16:12,377
Shut up!

205
00:16:18,617 --> 00:16:20,250
Leave her alone!

206
00:16:23,287 --> 00:16:25,655
No! No!

207
00:16:27,492 --> 00:16:29,425
You dumb, uppity bitch!

208
00:16:43,738 --> 00:16:46,806
You really are some kind of stupid.

209
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:52,410
Take her out.
See if she knows anything.

210
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:54,712
Should've done that before.

211
00:17:00,618 --> 00:17:02,619
Move.

212
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:22,269
You got nice clothes,

213
00:17:22,271 --> 00:17:25,605
time to make babies.

214
00:17:25,607 --> 00:17:27,907
You're holed up somewhere good.

215
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,408
Tell me where.

216
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,692
Don't draw this out, bitch.

217
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,628
Just tell me where.

218
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,731
Help yourself and
the baby in your belly.

219
00:17:58,366 --> 00:18:01,835
The way you stay alive
is you produce for us.

220
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:08,741
You're not the good guys.

221
00:18:09,976 --> 00:18:12,009
You should know that.

222
00:18:15,413 --> 00:18:16,846
He got you good, kid.

223
00:18:16,848 --> 00:18:18,881
He's in pain.

224
00:18:18,883 --> 00:18:21,049
Guys can't handle pain.

225
00:18:24,553 --> 00:18:26,820
Excuse me?

226
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,791
Just wanted to say thank you

227
00:18:31,793 --> 00:18:35,527
for helping Maggie,
for helping me.

228
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,797
My husband ed, he used to...

229
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:42,499
yeah? I don't care if your old man

230
00:18:42,501 --> 00:18:44,601
used to ring your bell.

231
00:18:44,603 --> 00:18:48,971
I see exactly who you are, Carol.

232
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,907
I know.

233
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:54,808
You're pathetic.

234
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,710
You wanna think we're just the same?

235
00:18:57,712 --> 00:18:58,877
Go ahead.

236
00:18:58,879 --> 00:19:01,512
You're wrong.

237
00:19:01,514 --> 00:19:04,781
He's just a warm body for my bed.

238
00:19:04,783 --> 00:19:08,618
That's it. I could kill him
in his sleep.

239
00:19:23,866 --> 00:19:26,801
Do you really believe in that crap?

240
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:35,642
My faith got me through
the death of my daughter.

241
00:19:35,644 --> 00:19:37,677
Hmm.

242
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,846
Well, the good news is maybe
you'll see her again soon.

243
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,055
What happened?

244
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:55,792
I stole something. Got caught.

245
00:19:57,094 --> 00:19:59,662
What?

246
00:19:59,664 --> 00:20:02,831
Gas, from this place.

247
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,699
- Why?
- To get a new car.

248
00:20:04,701 --> 00:20:06,867
Look for my boyfriend's body.

249
00:20:09,103 --> 00:20:10,870
Did you find him?

250
00:20:10,872 --> 00:20:13,639
He was blown up.

251
00:20:13,641 --> 00:20:15,874
Not much to find.

252
00:20:20,745 --> 00:20:22,679
"Frankie."

253
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:25,682
- Was that his name?
- Hell, no.

254
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:29,519
I barely knew him.

255
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:31,053
He was a dick.

256
00:20:36,525 --> 00:20:38,725
Frank was my dad.

257
00:20:41,528 --> 00:20:43,829
And that's what I was gonna
name the baby.

258
00:20:48,934 --> 00:20:51,868
- I'm sorry.
- No.

259
00:20:55,572 --> 00:20:57,806
You aren't.

260
00:20:57,808 --> 00:21:00,008
I'm not planning to die today.

261
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,077
Yeah, me neither.

262
00:21:05,713 --> 00:21:08,081
Thing is, one of us is wrong.

263
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:15,220
Just tell me where.

264
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:32,834
Have you thought about it?

265
00:21:32,836 --> 00:21:34,168
Talk to me.

266
00:21:37,106 --> 00:21:39,840
You weren't listening.

267
00:21:39,842 --> 00:21:42,209
I said I'd contact you.

268
00:21:42,211 --> 00:21:44,077
Would it make a difference

269
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:46,145
if I said I was sorry about that?

270
00:21:46,147 --> 00:21:48,780
What do you think?

271
00:21:48,782 --> 00:21:51,916
I think we're gonna make the trade,

272
00:21:51,918 --> 00:21:53,684
so tell me where.

273
00:21:56,087 --> 00:21:58,588
We haven't agreed to that.

274
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:01,624
You will.

275
00:22:01,626 --> 00:22:04,793
You know what? I'm not so sure.

276
00:22:05,961 --> 00:22:08,595
We'd be taking most of the risk,

277
00:22:08,597 --> 00:22:11,130
not getting much in
the way of a reward.

278
00:22:11,132 --> 00:22:15,834
The other option
won't work out for you.

279
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:21,973
We'll take our chances.

280
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,783
You don't have to do this.

281
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:33,984
You don't have to fight.

282
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:37,187
Your people killed all of my people.

283
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,788
Of course we gotta fight.

284
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:42,091
- We didn't want to.
- But you did.

285
00:22:42,093 --> 00:22:44,259
So tell me why.

286
00:22:47,062 --> 00:22:50,164
Your people ambushed
my people on the road,

287
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,299
tried to take everything we had.

288
00:22:55,836 --> 00:22:58,737
They were gonna kill them.

289
00:22:58,739 --> 00:23:01,239
Well, damn.

290
00:23:01,241 --> 00:23:04,909
So now we know what happened to T's group.

291
00:23:05,944 --> 00:23:08,879
Those idiots.

292
00:23:08,881 --> 00:23:10,914
Probably put on a big show.

293
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:15,218
Okay, fair play.

294
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,953
You were just defending yourselves.

295
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:25,192
But, see, your people killed
them on the road, right?

296
00:23:25,194 --> 00:23:28,762
Blew them to pieces.

297
00:23:28,764 --> 00:23:30,930
So, why not stop?

298
00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:38,202
They said they were
working for Negan.

299
00:23:39,704 --> 00:23:42,205
And what do you think
you know about Negan?

300
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:46,309
He sounded like a maniac.

301
00:23:46,311 --> 00:23:48,077
We were scared.
We had to stop him.

302
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:51,113
Sweetie, sweetie.

303
00:23:51,115 --> 00:23:53,982
We are all Negan.

304
00:23:56,986 --> 00:24:00,821
What do you mean?

305
00:24:03,724 --> 00:24:05,858
What does that mean?

306
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:29,244
Can I have one?

307
00:24:30,312 --> 00:24:33,714
Well, look at you, little bird.

308
00:24:33,716 --> 00:24:36,817
I didn't think you approved.

309
00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:38,952
I don't.

310
00:25:01,073 --> 00:25:03,774
You are weak.

311
00:25:04,876 --> 00:25:07,110
What are you so afraid of?

312
00:25:09,313 --> 00:25:12,782
So scared, you can't even
stick to your own principles.

313
00:25:15,819 --> 00:25:18,987
You don't want me to stick
to my own principles.

314
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:32,166
I was a secretary before.

315
00:25:35,937 --> 00:25:38,838
I fetched coffee for my boss

316
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,774
and made him feel good about himself.

317
00:25:41,776 --> 00:25:43,942
I spent most of my days reading

318
00:25:43,944 --> 00:25:46,311
stupid inspirational emails

319
00:25:46,313 --> 00:25:49,113
to try and feel good about myself.

320
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:52,349
There was this one
that kept going around.

321
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:55,819
A young woman was
having a hard time

322
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:58,788
and told her mom
she wanted to give up,

323
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,289
so her mom went to the kitchen

324
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:03,925
and started boiling
three pots of water.

325
00:26:03,927 --> 00:26:06,294
She put a carrot in one,
an egg in another,

326
00:26:06,296 --> 00:26:08,996
and ground coffee beans
in the last one.

327
00:26:10,298 --> 00:26:12,399
After they had boiled a while,
her mom said,

328
00:26:12,401 --> 00:26:16,136
"look, all three things went
through the same boiling water.

329
00:26:16,138 --> 00:26:19,806
The carrot went in strong
and came out soft.

330
00:26:19,808 --> 00:26:22,975
The egg was fragile
and came out hard.

331
00:26:22,977 --> 00:26:27,078
But the coffee beans
changed the water itself."

332
00:26:30,849 --> 00:26:33,350
You're supposed to want
to be the coffee beans.

333
00:26:36,854 --> 00:26:39,255
See, to me,
coffee was just a thing

334
00:26:39,257 --> 00:26:41,090
that my boss would drink up.

335
00:26:41,092 --> 00:26:43,158
No matter how many times I
refilled his damn cup,

336
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,027
it was just never enough.

337
00:26:49,865 --> 00:26:53,267
I was at work when the
army took over DC.

338
00:26:54,402 --> 00:26:56,403
We weren't allowed to leave.

339
00:26:56,405 --> 00:27:00,140
They had to evacuate all the
important people first...

340
00:27:00,142 --> 00:27:04,077
members of congress,
government employees.

341
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:07,013
So I was stuck with my boss.

342
00:27:07,015 --> 00:27:09,315
Not my family...

343
00:27:09,317 --> 00:27:14,186
my husband, my four girls...

344
00:27:25,498 --> 00:27:28,166
My boss was weak and stupid
and he was going to die

345
00:27:28,168 --> 00:27:30,501
and he was going
to take me down, too.

346
00:27:30,503 --> 00:27:33,403
He was the first person I killed

347
00:27:33,405 --> 00:27:35,471
so that I could live.

348
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:40,175
I stopped counting when
I hit double digits.

349
00:27:40,177 --> 00:27:43,177
That's right around the time i
stopped feeling bad about it.

350
00:27:45,146 --> 00:27:47,347
I am not like you.

351
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:52,318
I'm still me, but better.

352
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,487
I lost everything and
it made me stronger.

353
00:27:55,489 --> 00:27:57,422
You sure about that?

354
00:27:57,424 --> 00:27:59,323
I'm alive.

355
00:27:59,325 --> 00:28:01,558
With those people, those killers.

356
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,593
Your people are killers, Carol.

357
00:28:03,595 --> 00:28:07,029
That makes you a killer.

358
00:28:19,574 --> 00:28:22,008
You... you're the one.

359
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,609
Excuse me?

360
00:28:23,611 --> 00:28:26,411
You're the one who's afraid to die.

361
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:29,647
And you're going to.

362
00:28:29,649 --> 00:28:32,649
You will die.

363
00:28:35,052 --> 00:28:37,386
It's what's gonna happen
if you don't work this out.

364
00:28:40,022 --> 00:28:42,423
Are you going to kill me?

365
00:28:45,493 --> 00:28:47,393
I hope not.

366
00:28:55,435 --> 00:29:00,405
Asshole, are you there?

367
00:29:00,407 --> 00:29:02,440
I'm here.

368
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:08,278
We've thought about it.
We want to make the trade.

369
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,546
That's good.

370
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:14,383
There's a large field with a
sign that says "god is dead"

371
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:17,552
about two miles down I-66.

372
00:29:17,554 --> 00:29:20,388
Good visibility in all directions.

373
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:24,458
We'll meet you there.
10 minutes?

374
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,126
10 minutes.

375
00:29:29,563 --> 00:29:33,232
Mm..mm. Now, that was too easy.

376
00:29:33,234 --> 00:29:35,667
Maybe they're just itching
to get their people back.

377
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:37,702
No, there was no static.
There should've been static.

378
00:29:37,704 --> 00:29:40,104
They're close.
They're probably already here.

379
00:29:40,106 --> 00:29:41,538
We were careful,
but there were tracks.

380
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,273
- There had to be.
- No...

381
00:29:43,275 --> 00:29:45,141
They killed everybody back home.
They have the weapons.

382
00:29:45,143 --> 00:29:46,408
They know what they're doing.

383
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,276
They're probably waiting to kill us

384
00:29:48,278 --> 00:29:49,610
as soon as we walk out those doors.

385
00:29:49,612 --> 00:29:52,145
- That's what we'd do.
- No.

386
00:29:54,615 --> 00:29:57,617
You have to listen to me, please.

387
00:29:57,619 --> 00:30:00,553
Rick is a man of his word.

388
00:30:00,555 --> 00:30:03,455
He wouldn't put me and
Maggie at risk to attack.

389
00:30:03,457 --> 00:30:06,558
Then he's just as stupid as you are.

390
00:30:08,461 --> 00:30:10,627
What's your ETA?

391
00:30:10,629 --> 00:30:12,629
A few minutes away,

392
00:30:12,631 --> 00:30:14,631
- but the car is running on fumes.
- We have gas.

393
00:30:14,633 --> 00:30:16,599
We'll fill you up and then we move.

394
00:30:16,601 --> 00:30:18,734
Radio when you're back
in the perimeter.

395
00:30:18,736 --> 00:30:21,503
Copy that.

396
00:30:21,505 --> 00:30:23,571
We gotta get ready.

397
00:30:23,573 --> 00:30:26,674
Pull 'chelle out so she
doesn't get stuck in a fight.

398
00:30:26,676 --> 00:30:28,676
We have to be ready to
move at any second.

399
00:30:28,678 --> 00:30:30,477
What about the girl?

400
00:30:32,379 --> 00:30:33,545
Leave her for now.

401
00:30:33,547 --> 00:30:36,447
If we leave, we travel light.

402
00:30:36,449 --> 00:30:39,716
And if the pricks are here,
we pick 'em off at the door.

403
00:30:50,427 --> 00:30:52,494
Molls, we need this hall clear.

404
00:31:32,631 --> 00:31:35,331
Just a sec, sugar.

405
00:32:04,191 --> 00:32:05,724
Are you okay?

406
00:32:05,726 --> 00:32:08,393
I have to be.

407
00:32:08,395 --> 00:32:10,361
They've spread out, but I think
we can make it past them.

408
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:12,763
- We have to try.
- We can't leave them alive.

409
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:14,531
No, we should just go.

410
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:17,233
Carol, we have to finish this.
We have to.

411
00:33:03,678 --> 00:33:06,279
He was already dead.

412
00:33:06,281 --> 00:33:09,681
- He's turning.
- We should go.

413
00:33:10,849 --> 00:33:12,649
We need a gun.

414
00:33:14,385 --> 00:33:15,752
Give me that.

415
00:33:44,812 --> 00:33:48,714
Eat shit and die, Donnie!

416
00:33:48,716 --> 00:33:51,583
Where are ya, magnolia?

417
00:33:51,585 --> 00:33:53,818
I wanna bloody up that nice...

418
00:33:55,721 --> 00:33:58,621
agh!

419
00:34:07,763 --> 00:34:09,597
Let's go.

420
00:34:55,373 --> 00:34:56,806
They're using them to keep us in,

421
00:34:56,808 --> 00:34:58,640
keep the others out.

422
00:35:01,543 --> 00:35:03,510
Come on.

423
00:35:03,512 --> 00:35:04,944
We have to find 'em.

424
00:35:19,425 --> 00:35:20,657
Just run.

425
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:22,759
Shoot her.

426
00:35:22,761 --> 00:35:27,430
Go on, do it.

427
00:35:27,432 --> 00:35:31,367
You've killed Donnie,
you've killed Molly.

428
00:35:31,369 --> 00:35:34,403
Your people have destroyed my home.

429
00:35:34,405 --> 00:35:36,371
- Get outta here.
- Carol.

430
00:35:36,373 --> 00:35:37,739
You have no idea.

431
00:35:37,741 --> 00:35:41,375
The things I've done,

432
00:35:41,377 --> 00:35:43,377
what I've given up,

433
00:35:43,379 --> 00:35:46,380
what I had to do.

434
00:35:46,382 --> 00:35:48,582
- Just run.
- Carol, shoot her.

435
00:35:48,584 --> 00:35:51,718
Go ahead. I've already
lost everything.

436
00:35:55,823 --> 00:36:00,391
Paula?... Paula?

437
00:36:01,927 --> 00:36:03,860
Molly?

438
00:36:14,937 --> 00:36:17,605
You lying bitch!

439
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:37,686
I'll do it.

440
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:44,892
You're good.

441
00:36:44,894 --> 00:36:46,793
Nervous little bird.

442
00:36:48,595 --> 00:36:50,896
You were her.

443
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:56,767
But not now, right?

444
00:36:58,971 --> 00:37:00,171
Me, too.

445
00:37:01,973 --> 00:37:05,108
I told you to run.

446
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:08,544
If you could do all this,

447
00:37:08,546 --> 00:37:12,047
what were you so afraid of, Carol?

448
00:37:24,092 --> 00:37:27,060
I was afraid of this.

449
00:37:56,084 --> 00:37:58,585
Paula, we're approaching
the perimeter.

450
00:37:58,587 --> 00:37:59,986
Are we a go?

451
00:38:11,063 --> 00:38:13,264
Do you copy?

452
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,973
Meet us on the kill floor.

453
00:38:28,878 --> 00:38:32,847
I think I might have
killed 18 people.

454
00:38:32,849 --> 00:38:34,248
20.

455
00:38:37,151 --> 00:38:39,785
I should've killed Donnie,
too, in the woods.

456
00:38:39,787 --> 00:38:42,687
I had a clear shot. I didn't miss.

457
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:48,959
None of this would've happened
if I had just killed him.

458
00:38:48,961 --> 00:38:52,161
- Don't think about it.
- I can't stop.

459
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,998
We're almost done.

460
00:39:12,147 --> 00:39:14,848
Careful. The floor's slick.

461
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,649
You sure this is it?

462
00:39:16,651 --> 00:39:18,784
She said kill floor.

463
00:39:21,054 --> 00:39:23,187
Hey, this one's locked.

464
00:39:28,192 --> 00:39:29,992
What the hell?! Agh!

465
00:40:43,195 --> 00:40:45,196
Maggie.

466
00:40:45,198 --> 00:40:46,830
You okay?

467
00:40:46,832 --> 00:40:49,065
We got your trail.

468
00:40:49,067 --> 00:40:51,801
- You start a fire?
- Yeah.

469
00:40:51,803 --> 00:40:54,069
Hey, you good?

470
00:40:54,071 --> 00:40:55,970
No.

471
00:40:55,972 --> 00:40:57,805
Come here.

472
00:40:59,307 --> 00:41:02,208
They're dead. They're all dead,
the ones that took us.

473
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,109
They're all dead.

474
00:41:04,111 --> 00:41:06,778
Hey, are you okay?

475
00:41:07,846 --> 00:41:10,214
I just...

476
00:41:10,216 --> 00:41:12,316
I can't anymore.

477
00:41:13,251 --> 00:41:14,284
It's okay.

478
00:41:14,286 --> 00:41:16,986
Your friends are dead.

479
00:41:16,988 --> 00:41:19,822
No one's coming for ya.

480
00:41:19,824 --> 00:41:21,123
So you might as well talk.

481
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:24,226
Let him burn.

482
00:41:24,228 --> 00:41:27,028
I'm gonna ask you one last time...

483
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,864
How'd you get the bike?

484
00:41:29,866 --> 00:41:31,799
- We found it.
- Like hell you did.

485
00:41:31,801 --> 00:41:32,933
We found it.

486
00:41:32,935 --> 00:41:34,768
Was Negan in that building last night

487
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:36,302
or was he here?

488
00:41:42,075 --> 00:41:44,009
Both.

489
00:41:45,911 --> 00:41:47,978
I'm Negan, shithead.

490
00:41:49,847 --> 00:41:52,248
There's a whole world of
fun that we can talk about,

491
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,415
so let's have a chat.

492
00:41:53,417 --> 00:41:54,849
I'm sorry it had to come to this.
