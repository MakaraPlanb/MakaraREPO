(Announcer) Previously, on
AMC's "The Walking Dead..."

2
00:00:03,624 --> 00:00:06,241
I mapped out some of the
agricultural supply places

3
00:00:06,361 --> 00:00:07,994
in the area.

4
00:00:08,096 --> 00:00:08,889
(Grunting)

5
00:00:08,955 --> 00:00:10,722
- What's your name?
- Call me Jesus.

6
00:00:10,824 --> 00:00:12,591
He swiped your keys, didn't he?

7
00:00:12,693 --> 00:00:14,158
(Grunting)

00:00:14,261 --> 00:00:22,261

00:00:24,337 --> 00:00:25,636
(Man)
Rick, wake up!

10
00:00:25,738 --> 00:00:27,545
(gun cocking, sword unsheathing)

11
00:00:27,865 --> 00:00:30,137
We should talk.

12
00:00:31,003 --> 00:00:32,707
Abraham:
So there we were,

13
00:00:32,827 --> 00:00:35,813
scraping our sacks
in the sandbox.

14
00:00:35,815 --> 00:00:37,747
Open targets in the dunes.

15
00:00:37,749 --> 00:00:40,350
All of us sweating and swearing.

16
00:00:40,352 --> 00:00:43,753
Sure as hell beat sitting on
our asses 30 clicks to nowhere

17
00:00:43,755 --> 00:00:45,155
waiting for
our humpbacked friend

18
00:00:45,157 --> 00:00:47,724
to defecate the keys
to our transport.

19
00:00:47,726 --> 00:00:49,326
Sasha:
Camels don't eat keys.

20
00:00:49,328 --> 00:00:51,295
They do, it did.

21
00:00:51,297 --> 00:00:53,930
And it shit it out.
(chuckles)

22
00:00:53,932 --> 00:00:56,833
I shit you not.

23
00:00:56,835 --> 00:00:58,335
You're an idiot.

24
00:00:58,337 --> 00:01:00,337
I've never denied it.

25
00:01:01,406 --> 00:01:02,839
(giggles)

26
00:01:06,144 --> 00:01:07,811
Brave new world.

27
00:01:10,014 --> 00:01:13,549
I still can't stop thinking
about Maggie having a pup.

28
00:01:13,551 --> 00:01:14,951
In this.

29
00:01:14,953 --> 00:01:16,819
What about it?

30
00:01:16,821 --> 00:01:19,388
You know, the way things go.

31
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,157
The way they can.

32
00:01:23,394 --> 00:01:25,561
Yeah.

33
00:01:25,563 --> 00:01:27,095
Maybe that's why.

34
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:30,632
Because the way things go.

35
00:01:34,938 --> 00:01:36,705
Uh...

36
00:01:40,378 --> 00:01:42,911
You already called me an idiot.

37
00:01:42,913 --> 00:01:44,880
Never had to.

38
00:01:44,882 --> 00:01:47,315
(chuckles)
Yeah.

39
00:01:51,855 --> 00:01:54,155
I'll see you tomorrow.

40
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:56,191
Nope.

41
00:01:56,193 --> 00:01:58,326
I'm, uh,

42
00:01:58,328 --> 00:02:00,862
starting a new shift.

43
00:02:00,864 --> 00:02:03,431
The watch post on Baggarly.

44
00:02:05,201 --> 00:02:07,101
That so?

45
00:02:07,103 --> 00:02:09,336
Yeah, I already
talked to Eugene.

46
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:10,838
He wants to help out more.

47
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,608
Said he'd take over
my patrol with you.

48
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,343
Uh...

49
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:17,711
how about that?

50
00:02:17,713 --> 00:02:19,846
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

51
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,348
How about that?

52
00:02:24,053 --> 00:02:25,619
Um...

53
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:28,422
see you around?

54
00:02:28,424 --> 00:02:29,957
Yeah.

55
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:35,562
Yeah.

56
00:02:35,564 --> 00:02:37,431
See you around, Abraham.

57
00:02:50,111 --> 00:02:52,011
(sighs)

58
00:02:52,013 --> 00:02:53,179
Hey.

59
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,017
Hey, Abraham.

60
00:02:58,019 --> 00:02:59,385
Hey.

61
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,720
You're still here?

62
00:03:07,261 --> 00:03:10,463
You know Eugene's
gonna start patrolling?

63
00:03:10,465 --> 00:03:12,631
Mm-hmm.

64
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:16,301
He asked me to teach him how
to fieldstrip automatics.

65
00:03:16,303 --> 00:03:18,838
He's gonna teach me chemistry.

66
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,306
Mm.

67
00:03:21,308 --> 00:03:23,175
You can't teach chemistry.

68
00:03:23,177 --> 00:03:25,844
- (laughs) Really?
- Mm-mm.

69
00:03:27,414 --> 00:03:29,481
(moans)

70
00:03:33,653 --> 00:03:36,521
Sweet flaming mercy.

71
00:03:38,257 --> 00:03:42,193
That was just... beyond.

72
00:03:42,195 --> 00:03:44,128
Mm-hmm.
Oh, yeah?

73
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,503
Mm.

74
00:04:00,946 --> 00:04:02,146
Catch.

75
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,220
It's from the fuel truck.

76
00:04:09,222 --> 00:04:10,954
Had to crack a brake light.

77
00:04:13,058 --> 00:04:14,992
You made this?

78
00:04:14,994 --> 00:04:17,060
Thought your neck
looked a little lonely.

79
00:04:17,062 --> 00:04:19,930
Rosita Espinosa,

80
00:04:19,932 --> 00:04:23,567
you are damn near
perfection, you know that?

81
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:25,869
(chuckles)

82
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:31,774
Show me.

83
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:40,083
In the shower.

84
00:04:40,085 --> 00:04:41,751
In a minute.

85
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:45,487
(water running)

86
00:05:03,807 --> 00:05:05,874
Glenn:
Maggie.

87
00:05:05,876 --> 00:05:07,609
Hey.

88
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,247
We get the trellises in, we
can start going vertically.

89
00:05:12,249 --> 00:05:15,050
Double our yield of
tomatoes per square foot.

90
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,787
We can only keep stretching
our rations so far.

91
00:05:23,794 --> 00:05:26,294
Still haven't seen a single bud.

92
00:05:27,864 --> 00:05:30,331
Babe.

93
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,834
It'll grow.

94
00:05:32,836 --> 00:05:35,269
We're gonna be okay.

95
00:05:36,772 --> 00:05:38,406
(gate opens)

96
00:05:54,857 --> 00:05:56,757
(sighs)

97
00:06:01,296 --> 00:06:03,631
What the hell are you
doing in our house?

98
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:08,235
I'm, uh, sitting on the steps

99
00:06:08,237 --> 00:06:10,570
looking at this painting,

100
00:06:10,572 --> 00:06:13,973
waiting for your mom
and dad to get dressed.

101
00:06:13,975 --> 00:06:15,575
Hi...

102
00:06:15,577 --> 00:06:16,876
- I'm Jesus.
- (door opens)

103
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:18,745
(footsteps approach)

104
00:06:18,747 --> 00:06:22,249
Carl, hey, um...

105
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:26,019
- (door closes)
- (hammers click)

106
00:06:26,021 --> 00:06:28,087
It's... it's okay.

107
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,524
Rick:
You said we should talk.

108
00:06:31,526 --> 00:06:35,061
So let's talk.

109
00:06:35,063 --> 00:06:37,897
So, how'd you get out?

110
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:39,898
One guard can't cover two exits

111
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,168
or third floor windows.

112
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,336
Knots untie
and locks get picked.

113
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:46,805
- Entropy comes from order, right?
- Right.

114
00:06:48,643 --> 00:06:51,076
I checked out your arsenal.

115
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:53,078
I haven't seen anything
like that in a long time.

116
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,382
You're well-equipped, but
your provisions are low.

117
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:59,551
Very low for the amount
of people you have.

118
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:02,453
- 54?
- More than that.

119
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:06,858
Well, I appreciate the cookie.

120
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,026
My compliments to the chef.

121
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,594
Yeah, she ain't here.

122
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:14,031
Look, we got off to a bad start.

123
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:17,569
But we're on the same side...
the living side.

124
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,972
You and Rick had every reason
to leave me out there,

125
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:23,741
but you didn't.

126
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:27,312
I'm from a place
that's a lot like this one.

127
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:30,948
Part of my job is searching out
other settlements to trade with.

128
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,919
I took your truck because
my community needs things,

129
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:37,888
and both of you
looked like trouble.

130
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,057
I was wrong.

131
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,726
You're good people.

132
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:44,161
And this is a good place.

133
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,830
I think our communities may be in
a position to help each other.

134
00:07:46,832 --> 00:07:48,332
Do you have food?

135
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,066
We've started
to raise livestock.

136
00:07:50,068 --> 00:07:52,236
We scavenge, we grow.

137
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,137
Everything from
tomatoes to sorghum.

138
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:56,206
Tell us why we should
believe you.

139
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,541
I'll show you.

140
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:59,876
If we take a car, I can take
you back home in a day,

141
00:07:59,878 --> 00:08:03,246
and you can all see for yourselves who
we are and what we have to offer.

142
00:08:03,248 --> 00:08:07,350
Wait, you're looking
for more settlements.

143
00:08:07,352 --> 00:08:09,786
You mean you're already
trading with other groups?

144
00:08:13,825 --> 00:08:16,159
Your world's about to get
a whole lot bigger.

145
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,697

148
00:09:02,244 --> 00:09:04,011
Homemade oat cake.

149
00:09:04,013 --> 00:09:06,380
Complex carbohydrates,
omega-3s.

150
00:09:06,382 --> 00:09:08,683
Nah, I'm good.

151
00:09:08,685 --> 00:09:12,820
We're gonna make a pit stop.
I'll pick up something then.

152
00:09:12,822 --> 00:09:14,521
Like rabies?

153
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:19,660
Is this 'cause I tried
to get you that stuff?

154
00:09:19,662 --> 00:09:22,262
Yeah.

155
00:09:22,264 --> 00:09:24,431
And you remind me
of someone I used to know.

156
00:09:28,003 --> 00:09:29,570
Well...

157
00:09:29,572 --> 00:09:31,538
I hope it tastes
better than it looks.

158
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,472
'Cause it looks like shit.

159
00:09:33,474 --> 00:09:36,009
Shit's still better
than roadkill.

160
00:09:36,011 --> 00:09:38,511
Okay, maybe...
just eat it.

161
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,053
You sure?

162
00:09:47,055 --> 00:09:49,089
No.

163
00:09:49,091 --> 00:09:50,756
But if he's telling the truth,

164
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:53,426
this could be
the start of everything.

165
00:09:53,428 --> 00:09:56,495
(chatter)

166
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:01,166
Look, I was gonna tell you
about me and Michonne,

167
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:03,035
but it just happened.

168
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:05,438
It just happened.

169
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,339
Last night.

170
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:14,913
This is...
this is different.

171
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:18,217
It's cool.

172
00:10:18,219 --> 00:10:20,585
All right.

173
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:23,521
Well, get your stuff.

174
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:25,890
Gabriel can take care
of Judith while we're gone.

175
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,726
No, I'm not coming.

176
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:32,830
Someone's gotta stay back,
keep this place safe.

177
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,566
A kid with a messed-up face
probably wouldn't make

178
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:36,701
the best first
impression anyway.

179
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:50,681
(babbling)

180
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,750
Let's chew up some asphalt!

181
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:25,849
Hey.

182
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:29,919
Can I ask you a question?

183
00:11:29,921 --> 00:11:32,021
Sure.

184
00:11:37,995 --> 00:11:42,965
When you were, uh,
pouring the Bisquick,

185
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:44,500
were you trying
to make pancakes?

186
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,204
Uh...

187
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:49,872
yes?

188
00:11:51,642 --> 00:11:54,009
Oh, okay, um...

189
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,181
it's something that
we talked about, yeah.

190
00:11:59,183 --> 00:12:00,449
- Yeah.
- Why?

191
00:12:00,451 --> 00:12:02,651
No, I just...

192
00:12:04,221 --> 00:12:08,122
Well, given the precarious

193
00:12:08,124 --> 00:12:11,993
state of affairs
on any given Sunday,

194
00:12:11,995 --> 00:12:15,263
I am damn near floored
that you or anyone else

195
00:12:15,265 --> 00:12:17,466
would have the cojones
to make a call like that.

196
00:12:17,468 --> 00:12:20,335
I mean, well...

197
00:12:20,337 --> 00:12:24,605
we're trying to build
something, me and her.

198
00:12:24,607 --> 00:12:26,341
All of us.

199
00:12:29,846 --> 00:12:31,779
For the record,

200
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:34,182
I see rain coming,
I'm wearing galoshes.

201
00:12:37,553 --> 00:12:39,019
I double up.

202
00:12:56,939 --> 00:12:59,273
(brakes squealing)

203
00:13:00,776 --> 00:13:03,010
Yo, Rick.
What's going on?

204
00:13:03,012 --> 00:13:05,145
We got a crash ahead.

205
00:13:05,147 --> 00:13:07,080
Looks like it just happened.

206
00:13:11,052 --> 00:13:12,652
It's one of ours.

207
00:13:17,793 --> 00:13:19,759
(walkers snarling)

208
00:13:33,707 --> 00:13:37,076
If this is a trick,
it won't end well for you.

209
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:38,610
My people are in trouble.

210
00:13:38,612 --> 00:13:42,247
They don't... we don't
have a lot of fighters.

211
00:13:42,249 --> 00:13:45,584
I know how it looks,
but I'll play it out.

212
00:13:45,586 --> 00:13:46,852
Can I borrow a gun?

213
00:13:46,854 --> 00:13:48,454
No.

214
00:13:48,456 --> 00:13:50,288
We got tracks right here.

215
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,057
(bangs on door)

216
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:56,027
Jesus:
They gotta be in there.

217
00:13:58,365 --> 00:14:00,265
We moving in or what?

218
00:14:00,267 --> 00:14:02,633
How do we know this ain't
firecrackers in a trash can?

219
00:14:02,635 --> 00:14:04,069
You don't.

220
00:14:04,071 --> 00:14:06,871
We'll get your people.

221
00:14:06,873 --> 00:14:09,040
You're staying here
with one of us.

222
00:14:10,944 --> 00:14:12,410
That's the deal.

223
00:14:12,412 --> 00:14:14,545
- Glenn: Will you stay?
- Maggie: Yeah.

224
00:14:14,547 --> 00:14:16,647
Y'all go.
Just be careful.

225
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:17,982
Yeah.

226
00:14:17,984 --> 00:14:20,284
We're gonna be careful.

227
00:14:20,286 --> 00:14:22,419
Just hurry.

228
00:14:23,623 --> 00:14:26,123
You hear me whistle, shoot him.

229
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,959
I will.

230
00:14:46,237 --> 00:14:48,606
(walkers snarling)

231
00:14:58,951 --> 00:15:00,951
(snarling continues)

232
00:15:05,257 --> 00:15:07,524
- (grunting)
- (flesh squelching)

233
00:15:11,897 --> 00:15:14,264
Come on out.
We're not gonna hurt you.

234
00:15:14,266 --> 00:15:16,969
We're friends of Jesus.
We're here to get you out.

235
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:19,268
- There more of you?
- Two more. They ran ahead.

236
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,470
(walkers snarling)

237
00:15:25,777 --> 00:15:27,544
(snarling)

238
00:15:34,452 --> 00:15:36,385
(clatter)

239
00:15:39,955 --> 00:15:41,590
Come on.

240
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:43,592
We're with Jesus.
Let's go.

241
00:15:43,594 --> 00:15:46,062
I can't go with you.
I'm looking for my friend.

242
00:15:46,064 --> 00:15:48,931
He's close, and he's
hurt from the crash.

243
00:15:50,168 --> 00:15:52,067
(walkers snarling)

244
00:15:54,038 --> 00:15:57,138
- (man yelling)
- (walker snarling)

245
00:16:06,584 --> 00:16:09,150
No!

246
00:16:09,152 --> 00:16:11,319
Daryl:
Come on, man, let's go.

247
00:16:11,321 --> 00:16:12,920
Come on!

248
00:16:12,922 --> 00:16:14,456
- You got him?
- Go.

249
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,524
Come on.
Come on.

250
00:16:17,794 --> 00:16:19,494
(walker growls)

251
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,806
Name's Harlan, by the way.

252
00:16:31,808 --> 00:16:33,007
Maggie.

253
00:16:35,878 --> 00:16:38,746
That's my husband, Glenn.

254
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,280
Harlan: We're bringing
back medication,

255
00:16:40,282 --> 00:16:43,850
so you may have saved more people
than just us back there, Glenn.

256
00:16:45,654 --> 00:16:49,055
- You're a doctor?
- Yeah, that's right.

257
00:16:49,057 --> 00:16:51,525
You have any prenatal
vitamins in there?

258
00:16:56,198 --> 00:16:59,032
- For you?
- Mm-hmm.

259
00:16:59,034 --> 00:17:03,536
Well, uh, I was
an obstetrician before,

260
00:17:03,538 --> 00:17:05,939
and I most definitely owe you.

261
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:09,408
So, I'd say you two
just hit the jackpot.

262
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:23,956
You okay, Freddie?

263
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,363
For a second back there,

264
00:17:31,365 --> 00:17:34,066
just when I thought
he was gonna...

265
00:17:36,603 --> 00:17:38,436
I saw my wife.

266
00:17:38,438 --> 00:17:41,373
She died before all this.

267
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,076
(voice breaking)
Just when I thought it was over,

268
00:17:44,078 --> 00:17:45,443
there she was.

269
00:17:45,445 --> 00:17:47,546
(laughs)

270
00:17:47,548 --> 00:17:49,614
Clear as day.

271
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:03,494
(splats)

272
00:18:03,496 --> 00:18:06,097
(tires spinning)

273
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,704
Damn it.

274
00:18:12,706 --> 00:18:15,339
(revs motor)

275
00:18:15,341 --> 00:18:18,042
A storm must've passed through.

276
00:18:18,044 --> 00:18:19,976
We're stuck.

277
00:18:19,978 --> 00:18:23,347
No worries.
We're here.

278
00:18:36,862 --> 00:18:39,462
That's us.

279
00:18:39,464 --> 00:18:40,997
That's the Hilltop.

280
00:19:16,104 --> 00:19:17,791
Man:
Stop right there.

281
00:19:17,911 --> 00:19:19,873
- Whoa!
- Daryl: You gonna make us?

282
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,241
Jesus, what the hell is this?

283
00:19:21,367 --> 00:19:25,402
Open the gates, Cal.
Freddie's hurt.

284
00:19:25,404 --> 00:19:26,770
Look, sorry about these guys.

285
00:19:26,772 --> 00:19:28,605
They get antsy standing up there

286
00:19:28,607 --> 00:19:29,607
all day doing nothing.

287
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,401
They give up the weapons.
Then we'll open the gates.

288
00:19:32,403 --> 00:19:33,869
Why don't you come
down here and get 'em?

289
00:19:33,871 --> 00:19:36,338
Gentlemen, look, we vouch for
these people, all right?

290
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,939
They saved us out there.

291
00:19:37,941 --> 00:19:40,241
Jesus:
Lower the spears.

292
00:19:40,243 --> 00:19:41,410
Look, I'm not
taking any chances.

293
00:19:41,412 --> 00:19:43,312
Tell your guy Gregory
to come out here.

294
00:19:43,314 --> 00:19:44,680
No.

295
00:19:44,682 --> 00:19:47,582
Don't you see
what just happened?

296
00:19:47,584 --> 00:19:50,619
I'm letting you keep your guns.

297
00:19:50,621 --> 00:19:53,254
Look, we ran out
of ammo months ago.

298
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,691
I like you people.

299
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,327
I trust you.

300
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,863
Trust us.

301
00:20:16,278 --> 00:20:18,278
Open the gates, Cal.

302
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,180
(gates squeaking)

303
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,073
(clucking)

304
00:20:54,249 --> 00:20:57,350
Hey, thanks again.

305
00:20:57,352 --> 00:21:01,087
Come see me whenever. I'm just over
here in the medical trailer, okay?

306
00:21:17,705 --> 00:21:21,206
There was a materials yard
for a power company nearby.

307
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,941
That's how we put up the walls.

308
00:21:24,477 --> 00:21:26,912
A lot of people came
from a FEMA camp.

309
00:21:26,914 --> 00:21:29,114
Trailers came with them.

310
00:21:29,116 --> 00:21:31,383
How did people find
out about this place?

311
00:21:32,786 --> 00:21:35,486
That's called Barrington House.

312
00:21:35,488 --> 00:21:38,723
The family that owned it gave
it to the state in the '30s.

313
00:21:38,725 --> 00:21:42,827
The state turned it into
a living history museum.

314
00:21:42,829 --> 00:21:47,331
Every elementary school for 50 miles
used to come here for field trips.

315
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:51,702
The place was running a long time before
the modern world built up around it.

316
00:21:51,704 --> 00:21:54,038
I think people came here
because they figured

317
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,140
it'd keep running after
the modern world broke down.

318
00:21:57,944 --> 00:22:01,578
Those windows up there let us see
for miles in every direction.

319
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,347
It's perfect for security.

320
00:22:03,349 --> 00:22:06,450
Come on.
I'll show you inside.

321
00:22:30,342 --> 00:22:33,276
Good gracious, Ignatius.

322
00:22:33,278 --> 00:22:35,718
Jesus: Most of the rooms have
been converted to living spaces.

323
00:22:36,914 --> 00:22:39,082
Even the ones
that weren't bedrooms.

324
00:22:39,084 --> 00:22:41,650
People live here
and the trailers?

325
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,386
We plan to build.

326
00:22:44,388 --> 00:22:45,988
There's babies being born.

327
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:49,692
Jesus.

328
00:22:49,694 --> 00:22:51,627
You're back.

329
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,730
With guests.

330
00:22:54,732 --> 00:22:57,733
Jesus:
Everyone, this is Gregory.

331
00:22:57,735 --> 00:22:59,734
He keeps the trains
running on time around here.

332
00:22:59,736 --> 00:23:02,237
I'm the boss.

333
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:04,706
Well, I'm Rick.
We have a community...

334
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:07,376
Why don't y'all
go get cleaned up, hmm?

335
00:23:11,281 --> 00:23:13,148
We're fine.

336
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,817
Jesus will show you where
you can get washed up.

337
00:23:15,819 --> 00:23:17,652
Then come back down here
when you're ready.

338
00:23:19,188 --> 00:23:21,689
It's hard to keep
this place clean.

339
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:24,993
Yeah. Sure.

340
00:23:28,364 --> 00:23:30,498
Follow me.

341
00:23:36,872 --> 00:23:39,740
You clean up first.
You talk to him.

342
00:23:39,742 --> 00:23:41,275
Why?

343
00:23:41,277 --> 00:23:43,277
I shouldn't.

344
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,312
And you gotta start
doing these things.

345
00:24:11,106 --> 00:24:14,274
How long do you think Rick and
Michonne been ugging bumplies?

346
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,609
I don't know.

347
00:24:18,913 --> 00:24:20,646
You ever think about it?

348
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,249
Settling down?

349
00:24:26,487 --> 00:24:28,054
You think shit's settled?

350
00:24:47,675 --> 00:24:49,207
Gregory.

351
00:24:49,209 --> 00:24:51,376
- Natalie, right?
- Maggie.

352
00:24:51,378 --> 00:24:53,011
That's pretty close.

353
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:54,913
Not really.

354
00:24:54,915 --> 00:24:58,582
She calls them like she sees them.
I like that.

355
00:24:58,584 --> 00:25:00,185
Come in, let's chat.

356
00:25:07,027 --> 00:25:08,459
Yeah.

357
00:25:08,461 --> 00:25:11,762
I... I came to this
place once before,

358
00:25:11,764 --> 00:25:13,597
when it was a museum,

359
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:16,734
this, um, Chamber
of Commerce thing.

360
00:25:18,971 --> 00:25:22,072
Love that painting.

361
00:25:22,074 --> 00:25:25,443
I never figured it'd be mine,

362
00:25:25,445 --> 00:25:27,677
here it is.

363
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,848
It's like it was waiting
for me the whole time.

364
00:25:34,053 --> 00:25:35,252
Hmm.

365
00:25:41,626 --> 00:25:44,861
Jesus told me your group saved Dr.
Carson.

366
00:25:44,863 --> 00:25:47,364
Obviously, a doctor's
a rare commodity today,

367
00:25:47,366 --> 00:25:49,332
so I want to thank you
for bringing ours back.

368
00:25:49,334 --> 00:25:51,368
My husband saved him.

369
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,636
I'll be sure to thank him, too.

370
00:25:53,638 --> 00:25:56,639
This place, what you have here,

371
00:25:56,641 --> 00:25:58,040
has been here since the start?

372
00:25:58,042 --> 00:25:59,342
That's right.

373
00:25:59,344 --> 00:26:03,112
And how... how is it...
how have you survived here?

374
00:26:03,114 --> 00:26:06,782
You're looking at how.
I'm good at this.

375
00:26:06,784 --> 00:26:09,685
And I don't get
hung up on the details.

376
00:26:09,687 --> 00:26:12,355
Where you live, is it as
nice as the Hilltop Colony?

377
00:26:12,357 --> 00:26:13,789
It's just different.

378
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:15,191
How do you feed everyone?

379
00:26:15,193 --> 00:26:18,326
Jesus said you had land
for gardens, but no crops.

380
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:19,961
We just started planting.

381
00:26:19,963 --> 00:26:22,264
- Planting what?
- Cucumbers, tomatoes.

382
00:26:22,266 --> 00:26:26,568
Oh, crops... soy,
corn, hemp, sorghum.

383
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,637
- Garden stuff.
- But you have guns,

384
00:26:28,639 --> 00:26:30,773
so I assume you have
a decent weapons cache.

385
00:26:30,775 --> 00:26:32,775
It's decent.

386
00:26:32,777 --> 00:26:35,777
And your infirmary,
is it stocked?

387
00:26:35,779 --> 00:26:38,246
Is yours?

388
00:26:38,248 --> 00:26:40,848
We came here hoping
to talk trade.

389
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:44,052
Do you have enough
here for that?

390
00:26:44,054 --> 00:26:45,586
You see what I have here.

391
00:26:45,588 --> 00:26:47,255
You see what I've built.

392
00:26:48,792 --> 00:26:53,728
Jesus said that your food situation
was challenged right now.

393
00:26:55,465 --> 00:26:59,734
You don't keep people fed,
it comes apart.

394
00:26:59,736 --> 00:27:03,070
Let's speak the common
tongue here, huh?

395
00:27:03,072 --> 00:27:04,939
You don't have shit.

396
00:27:04,941 --> 00:27:08,208
Now, I'm happy to help.
I'm a nice guy.

397
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:12,179
But we can't just give
things away for free.

398
00:27:12,181 --> 00:27:14,148
How's this?

399
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:17,985
Since you can't offer much, I'll let
your people work here for their share.

400
00:27:17,987 --> 00:27:20,554
You'd be a welcome addition
to the community,

401
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:23,356
a smart and beautiful woman.

402
00:27:23,358 --> 00:27:26,392
Getting back
to that common tongue,

403
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,829
I can tell ya, I can make
it worth your while.

404
00:27:28,831 --> 00:27:31,331
- Let me stop you right there.
- Listen, honey.

405
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:35,134
Stop coming on to me
with calling me honey.

406
00:27:35,136 --> 00:27:36,937
You don't have any ammunition.

407
00:27:36,939 --> 00:27:38,304
Who said that?

408
00:27:38,306 --> 00:27:40,273
You're low on medication.

409
00:27:40,275 --> 00:27:43,009
You need things.
We need things.

410
00:27:43,011 --> 00:27:45,478
What, are you gonna give us a bottle
of aspirin and a box of bullets?

411
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,447
Our communities
can help each other.

412
00:27:49,917 --> 00:27:52,151
Thank you, Natalie.
Been a good talk.

413
00:27:57,424 --> 00:27:59,291
We can help each other.

414
00:27:59,293 --> 00:28:01,293
We're doing fine.

415
00:28:01,295 --> 00:28:03,095
Are you?

416
00:28:11,515 --> 00:28:13,998
Jesus: We want to generate trade.
Gregory does.

417
00:28:14,238 --> 00:28:16,306
But ammo isn't something
we urgently need.

418
00:28:16,308 --> 00:28:18,508
- Well, how's that?
- The walls hold.

419
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,242
We just brought in
more medicine.

420
00:28:20,244 --> 00:28:22,311
Gregory wants
the best deal possible.

421
00:28:22,313 --> 00:28:24,646
Yeah, well, we want things, too.

422
00:28:24,648 --> 00:28:26,448
Rick:
We need food.

423
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:29,218
We came all this way,
we're gonna get it.

424
00:28:30,988 --> 00:28:33,488
I will talk to him

425
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,357
and we will work this out.

426
00:28:37,628 --> 00:28:39,260
Circumstances change.

427
00:28:39,262 --> 00:28:43,298
We're doing well now,
and you will next.

428
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,601
I will make him understand that.

429
00:28:46,603 --> 00:28:48,770
Can you give me a few days?

430
00:28:53,076 --> 00:28:54,642
We can.

431
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:01,816
Yeah.

432
00:29:03,053 --> 00:29:04,919
(soft laugh)

433
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:11,024
What's wrong?

434
00:29:11,026 --> 00:29:12,626
They're back.

435
00:29:25,675 --> 00:29:28,275
Gregory: Ethan, what
happened to everybody else?

436
00:29:28,277 --> 00:29:30,878
Where's Tim and Marsha?

437
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,212
They're dead.

438
00:29:34,783 --> 00:29:38,252
- Negan?
- Yeah.

439
00:29:38,254 --> 00:29:41,021
- We had a deal.
- Man: He said it wasn't enough.

440
00:29:41,023 --> 00:29:43,423
Was the drop light?

441
00:29:43,425 --> 00:29:44,858
Gregory:
No.

442
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,860
They still have Craig.

443
00:29:46,862 --> 00:29:50,930
They said they'd keep him
alive, return him to us,

444
00:29:50,932 --> 00:29:53,366
if I deliver a message to you.

445
00:29:53,368 --> 00:29:54,868
So, tell me.

446
00:29:56,204 --> 00:29:57,771
I'm sorry.

447
00:29:57,773 --> 00:29:59,305
- (groans)
- (flesh squelches)

448
00:30:01,276 --> 00:30:04,010
Get off of me!
I had to!

449
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:05,844
(grunting)

450
00:30:23,431 --> 00:30:24,630
- (ears ringing)
- (heart pounding)

451
00:30:24,632 --> 00:30:26,331
Sasha's voice:
Maybe that's why.

452
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:28,767
Because the way things go.

453
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,570
(screams)

454
00:30:33,073 --> 00:30:35,006
- (yells)
- Glenn: Hey!

455
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:37,542
Stay back! Anybody
who tries to stop me

456
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,144
is killing my brother!

457
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,816
Michonne:
Drop it.

458
00:30:55,161 --> 00:30:57,261
(groaning)

459
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:02,366
(groaning)

460
00:31:11,043 --> 00:31:13,043
What?

461
00:31:13,045 --> 00:31:16,046
Ethan!
You killed him.

462
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:18,515
He tried to kill
Gregory, then me.

463
00:31:18,517 --> 00:31:20,617
(grunts)

464
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:22,118
Ah!

465
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,687
Don't.

466
00:31:23,689 --> 00:31:26,422
Drop it now!

467
00:31:26,424 --> 00:31:27,557
I don't think I will.

468
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:29,659
Everyone, this is over!

469
00:31:29,661 --> 00:31:31,962
(panting)

470
00:31:31,964 --> 00:31:33,329
It's over.

471
00:31:33,331 --> 00:31:37,066
Ethan was our friend,
but let's not pretend

472
00:31:37,068 --> 00:31:39,902
he was anything more than
a coward who attacked us.

473
00:31:39,904 --> 00:31:42,071
He did this.

474
00:31:43,774 --> 00:31:45,475
And these people stopped him.

475
00:31:47,178 --> 00:31:49,345
(crying)

476
00:31:52,917 --> 00:31:54,984
What can I do?

477
00:31:54,986 --> 00:31:57,820
Put the gun away.

478
00:31:57,822 --> 00:31:59,287
You've done enough.

479
00:32:03,494 --> 00:32:05,427
You need to know

480
00:32:05,429 --> 00:32:07,663
that things aren't
as simple as they might seem.

481
00:32:10,067 --> 00:32:11,933
Just give me some time.

482
00:32:18,742 --> 00:32:20,409
(groaning)

483
00:32:25,449 --> 00:32:27,516
- Daryl: Hey, man.
- Huh?

484
00:32:27,518 --> 00:32:29,083
You good?

485
00:32:29,085 --> 00:32:31,452
Yeah.

486
00:32:31,454 --> 00:32:33,855
I'm better than all right.

487
00:32:33,857 --> 00:32:36,190
(laughs)

488
00:32:36,192 --> 00:32:37,692
(Abraham grunts)

489
00:32:46,817 --> 00:32:49,484
(door opens)

490
00:32:49,486 --> 00:32:52,087
Jesus: Dr. Carson was
able to patch Gregory up.

491
00:32:52,089 --> 00:32:54,456
He's in pain, but he'll live.

492
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:57,526
So, what happens now?

493
00:32:57,528 --> 00:32:59,561
Things like that
don't usually happen here,

494
00:32:59,563 --> 00:33:02,998
but, uh, it's settled.

495
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,600
We heard the name Negan.

496
00:33:05,602 --> 00:33:10,004
A while back, Daryl and Abraham
had a run-in with his men.

497
00:33:10,006 --> 00:33:11,640
Who is he?

498
00:33:11,642 --> 00:33:15,510
Negan's the head of a group of
people he calls the Saviors.

499
00:33:15,512 --> 00:33:19,881
As soon as the walls were
built, the Saviors showed up.

500
00:33:19,883 --> 00:33:22,616
They met with Gregory
on behalf of their boss.

501
00:33:22,618 --> 00:33:27,021
They made a lot of demands,
even more threats.

502
00:33:27,023 --> 00:33:30,724
And he killed
one of us... Rory.

503
00:33:30,726 --> 00:33:33,361
He was 16 years old.

504
00:33:33,363 --> 00:33:37,698
They beat him to death
right in front of us.

505
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:41,535
Said we needed to understand,
right off the bat.

506
00:33:43,138 --> 00:33:46,273
Gregory's not exactly
good at confrontation.

507
00:33:46,275 --> 00:33:47,842
He's not the leader
I would've chosen,

508
00:33:47,844 --> 00:33:50,611
but he helped make
this place what it is,

509
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:52,079
and the people like him.

510
00:33:52,081 --> 00:33:54,047
He made the deal.

511
00:33:54,049 --> 00:33:55,983
Jesus:
Half of everything.

512
00:33:55,985 --> 00:33:58,885
Our supplies, our crops,

513
00:33:58,887 --> 00:34:02,789
our livestock,
it goes to the Saviors.

514
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:05,158
And what do you get in return?

515
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,559
They don't attack this place.

516
00:34:06,561 --> 00:34:08,695
They don't kill us.

517
00:34:08,697 --> 00:34:10,763
Why not just kill them?

518
00:34:10,765 --> 00:34:13,132
Most of the people here don't
even know how to fight,

519
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,433
even if we had ammo.

520
00:34:14,435 --> 00:34:16,870
Well, how many people
does Negan have?

521
00:34:16,872 --> 00:34:18,170
We don't know.

522
00:34:18,172 --> 00:34:20,139
We've seen groups as big as 20.

523
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:23,109
Now, hold up. So, they
show up, they kill a kid,

524
00:34:23,111 --> 00:34:25,712
and you give them
half of everything?

525
00:34:25,714 --> 00:34:27,546
These dicks just got
a good story.

526
00:34:27,548 --> 00:34:29,315
The bogeyman, he ain't shit.

527
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,916
Well, how do you know?

528
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:34,253
A month ago, we took
his guys out PDQ.

529
00:34:34,255 --> 00:34:36,855
Left them in pieces and puddles.

530
00:34:36,857 --> 00:34:39,225
You know, we'll do it.

531
00:34:39,227 --> 00:34:42,628
If we go get your man back,
kill Negan, take out his boys,

532
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,362
will you hook us up?

533
00:34:44,364 --> 00:34:47,032
We want food, medicine,
and one of them cows.

534
00:34:48,903 --> 00:34:53,271
Confrontation's never been
something we've had trouble with.

535
00:34:58,111 --> 00:34:59,912
I'll take it to Gregory.

536
00:35:10,457 --> 00:35:14,225
They have food, we don't.

537
00:35:14,227 --> 00:35:16,861
We don't have
enough of anything.

538
00:35:16,863 --> 00:35:20,031
Except us.

539
00:35:20,033 --> 00:35:22,399
What we can do.

540
00:35:26,338 --> 00:35:29,239
This is the trade.

541
00:35:30,509 --> 00:35:32,610
It's gonna cost us something.

542
00:35:34,646 --> 00:35:36,780
(door opens)

543
00:35:38,551 --> 00:35:41,651
Gregory's up.
He wants to talk.

544
00:35:43,689 --> 00:35:44,921
To Maggie.

545
00:35:46,024 --> 00:35:49,359
He wants to talk to Maggie.

546
00:35:49,361 --> 00:35:51,094
You got this.

547
00:35:53,531 --> 00:35:55,599
Deanna was right about you.

548
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:02,305
I'm sorry in advance.
Gregory can be a real prick.

549
00:36:02,307 --> 00:36:04,007
I know.

550
00:36:04,009 --> 00:36:06,009
(knock on door)

551
00:36:06,011 --> 00:36:08,911
Come in.

552
00:36:08,913 --> 00:36:10,379
Mm.

553
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:13,816
Sorry for the gloom.

554
00:36:13,818 --> 00:36:16,519
They have me
on these antibiotics

555
00:36:16,521 --> 00:36:19,655
that make me sensitive
to the sunlight.

556
00:36:19,657 --> 00:36:21,991
This is agony.

557
00:36:21,993 --> 00:36:25,427
It's like somebody's twisting my
intestines with a cement mixer.

558
00:36:25,429 --> 00:36:27,462
It could've been worse.

559
00:36:27,464 --> 00:36:29,932
You're lucky we were here.

560
00:36:29,934 --> 00:36:31,967
Jesus told you about our offer?

561
00:36:31,969 --> 00:36:33,335
He did.

562
00:36:33,337 --> 00:36:35,270
What makes you think you can
do what we haven't done?

563
00:36:35,272 --> 00:36:38,007
We've handled people like Negan.

564
00:36:38,009 --> 00:36:41,309
- How?
- They're dead.

565
00:36:41,311 --> 00:36:42,977
We can get your man back.

566
00:36:45,382 --> 00:36:48,049
I don't know if Craig's
worth the trouble.

567
00:36:48,051 --> 00:36:50,552
I mean, it's his
brother who did this.

568
00:36:50,554 --> 00:36:55,157
He was fighting to save
someone he loves.

569
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:56,390
He was afraid.

570
00:36:56,392 --> 00:36:59,193
That makes him weak.

571
00:36:59,195 --> 00:37:01,796
Frankly, I don't know if I want
him back in our gene pool.

572
00:37:01,798 --> 00:37:06,067
My dad used to tell me forgiveness
takes more strength than anger.

573
00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:08,636
Yeah, I guess.

574
00:37:08,638 --> 00:37:10,271
He's a hell of a cook.

575
00:37:10,273 --> 00:37:13,541
He makes these amazing baked
eggs with green tomatoes.

576
00:37:13,543 --> 00:37:16,910
You give us supplies,
we'll save Craig

577
00:37:16,912 --> 00:37:19,780
and take care of Negan
and the Saviors, permanently.

578
00:37:19,782 --> 00:37:21,682
(Gregory laughs)

579
00:37:21,684 --> 00:37:24,718
I'm sorry, I find this whole
conversation pretty funny.

580
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,321
I mean, you balked
when I proposed

581
00:37:27,323 --> 00:37:30,891
that your people work for
our supplies, but now...

582
00:37:30,893 --> 00:37:33,359
isn't that exactly
what's happening here?

583
00:37:33,361 --> 00:37:36,830
See, I had leverage
and I used it.

584
00:37:36,832 --> 00:37:39,399
See?
It wasn't personal.

585
00:37:39,401 --> 00:37:41,234
Yes.

586
00:37:41,236 --> 00:37:44,504
We need food.
You have it.

587
00:37:44,506 --> 00:37:46,506
We're willing to work for it.

588
00:37:49,277 --> 00:37:52,044
Then I'll get supplies
for your people.

589
00:37:52,046 --> 00:37:53,713
Good.

590
00:37:53,715 --> 00:37:57,684
I'll talk to Jesus and he'll
make the arrangements.

591
00:37:57,686 --> 00:37:59,419
See, this was fun.

592
00:38:01,523 --> 00:38:03,488
Exciting.

593
00:38:07,095 --> 00:38:09,161
Half.

594
00:38:09,163 --> 00:38:10,462
Excuse me?

595
00:38:10,464 --> 00:38:13,065
Half of what you have.

596
00:38:13,067 --> 00:38:15,267
I saw what happened out there.

597
00:38:15,269 --> 00:38:18,770
Negan's expecting
more supplies from this place.

598
00:38:18,772 --> 00:38:21,740
And more and more.

599
00:38:21,742 --> 00:38:23,208
And if it keeps going like that,

600
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:25,810
pretty soon you won't
have anything left.

601
00:38:27,314 --> 00:38:29,481
What happens then?

602
00:38:29,483 --> 00:38:33,785
Without ammo,
without fighters...

603
00:38:33,787 --> 00:38:35,720
you'd be a dead man.

604
00:38:38,892 --> 00:38:41,459
So half of everything you have

605
00:38:41,461 --> 00:38:43,661
right now

606
00:38:43,663 --> 00:38:45,764
or the deal's off.

607
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:49,634
You see?

608
00:38:49,636 --> 00:38:51,502
I have leverage.

609
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,406
(groans)

610
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:59,277
Congratulations.

611
00:38:59,279 --> 00:39:02,546
You have yourself a deal.

612
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:05,683
You want anything else?
Kidney, maybe?

613
00:39:05,685 --> 00:39:08,118
Not that...

614
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,753
but I do want something.

615
00:39:17,562 --> 00:39:20,330
Even Negan didn't get
this much up front.

616
00:39:23,602 --> 00:39:25,201
What?

617
00:39:25,203 --> 00:39:29,005
Jesus said you've been taking supplies
to Negan since the beginning.

618
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:32,676
We're gonna get Craig back.

619
00:39:32,678 --> 00:39:36,045
The only way to get Craig back
is to bring them Gregory's head.

620
00:39:37,382 --> 00:39:39,349
We're gonna get Craig back.

621
00:39:39,351 --> 00:39:41,117
How?

622
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,820
We need to know what you
know about Negan's compound.

623
00:39:45,223 --> 00:39:47,389
We need your help.

624
00:39:48,526 --> 00:39:50,159
We need you to come.

625
00:39:58,369 --> 00:40:00,569
Yeah.

626
00:40:00,571 --> 00:40:02,404
Okay.

627
00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:15,516
You got room
for one more, right?

628
00:40:15,518 --> 00:40:18,954
I mean, we're talking about
righting the world here.

629
00:40:18,956 --> 00:40:20,755
Plus, you still have my knives.

630
00:40:20,757 --> 00:40:22,457
(chuckles)

631
00:40:27,097 --> 00:40:29,264
Hey, you up for this?

632
00:40:30,334 --> 00:40:32,032
It's gonna be a fight.

633
00:40:32,034 --> 00:40:34,635
We'll win.

634
00:40:34,637 --> 00:40:36,136
We have to.

635
00:40:38,641 --> 00:40:40,375
We'll win.

636
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,801
(heart beating)

637
00:41:21,182 --> 00:41:22,448
(sighs)
