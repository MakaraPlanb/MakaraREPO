1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,004
( Snarling )

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,445
Sasha on walkie:
All right.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,284
Daryl on walkie:
That's 20?

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,283
Sasha: It will be.
642 is a mile ahead.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,250
We gotta put distance between us
and them before the turnoff.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,890
Abraham on walkie:
So floor it.

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,407
Daryl:
All right, try to keep up.

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,562
Sasha: Daryl, have you looked
at this car?

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,530
( Chuckles ) Believe me,
we want to get back there, too.

10
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,640
(gunfire)

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,411
( gunfire continues )

12
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,401
( bullets ricocheting )

13
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,242
( engine starts )

14
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,800
( tires squeal )

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,122
(gunfire)

16
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,610
(grunts)

17
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,121
( gunfire continues )

18
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,922
( snarling )

19
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,809
( snarling )

20
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,687
Leave it.

21
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,286
Just gonna give it
a last little polish.

22
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,844
What the hell
you got to grin about?

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,729
We won, darlin'.

24
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,328
There could be more.

25
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,285
- ( Tires squealing )
- ( cars approaching )

26
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,164
Screw it.

27
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,690
( Panting )

28
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,727
(walker growling )

29
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,890
( theme music playing )

30
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,805
(birds calling)

31
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,927
(grunting )

32
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,125
( panting )

33
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,283
Sasha?

34
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,805
Abraham,
are you there?

35
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,849
( Static hissing )

36
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,687
(wincing )

37
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,689
( exhales )

38
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,682
( branch snaps )

39
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,010
( rustling )

40
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,051
You found us, okay?

41
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,890
Here we are.

42
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,769
We earned what we took.

43
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,285
( Branch snaps )

44
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,442
(thumps)

45
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,208
( echoing ) Probably just another
soldier from one of the outposts.

46
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,249
Probably hates him, too.

47
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,371
( Echoing )
You know how to use one?

48
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,363
( Man's voice echoing )
Yeah.

49
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,249
Never liked using them to hunt.

50
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,409
( Echoing ) We pick up Patty
and we're gone, okay?

51
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,921
This is the last day
we gotta live like this.

52
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,808
( Crickets chirping )

53
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,285
Get up.

54
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,284
Hey, get up.

55
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,125
( Safety unlocks )

56
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,568
We're moving.
Here's the deal.

57
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,451
You don't say shit
and I don't kill you.

58
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,965
I ain't who you think.

59
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,442
- ( Hammer clicks )
- Say something else.

60
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,409
Go ahead.

61
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,089
Follow them.

62
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,007
Here, drink the rest.

63
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,486
- We should save it.
- We'll find some more.

64
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,801
Drink.

65
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,962
You're supposed
to stay hydrated.

66
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,810
It all works together.

67
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,689
Yeah, it does.

68
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,690
Have it.

69
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,842
We don't need you
falling down. Drink.

70
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,290
They find us,
maybe we give you to them,

71
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,369
they let us call it even.

72
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,682
You see,
we're reasonable people.

73
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,127
Everybody's got their code.

74
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,642
You feel you gotta kneel,
that's fair enough.

75
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,643
We don't.

76
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,370
Let's go.

77
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,004
I can't believe we're back.

78
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,889
It's not home anymore,

79
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,008
but it's better
than where we were.

80
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,049
This is a pit stop.

81
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,204
We pick up Patty,
nothing more than that.

82
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,685
How'd you do it?

83
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,171
You saw where we left the truck?

84
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,010
Mm-hmm.

85
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,051
We opened the valve and drove
all the way in from Farmview Road.

86
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,130
Ran from the tree line
till we got to the pavement.

87
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,084
Lit up a matchbook
from the Sweetwater

88
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,120
- and dropped it in on the trail.
- ( growling )

89
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,210
Then we just ran for the car.

90
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,045
Got in and the dead ones
were there.

91
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,090
They were beating
on the hood, and then...

92
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,891
And then boom!

93
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,965
Knocked 'em on their asses
and I took an axe to each one.

94
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,566
Then we just
watched it go up.

95
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,769
No more moans,
no more of that wailing.

96
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,891
It was just the fire,
just burning them all away.

97
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,923
You did all this?

98
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,570
It was right at the start.

99
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,609
Everything stopped...
The TV, the radio.

100
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,082
We were here.
The forest was full of them.

101
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,240
And the other ones in town,
they were drawn to it.

102
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,930
They just walked
right into the flames.

103
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,603
We got most of them.

104
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,604
Thought we ended it for us,
and she was in DC.

105
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,401
We thought everyone was fighting them
wherever they were.

106
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,131
Yeah, we thought that was
what everybody was doing.

107
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,964
Fighting it.

108
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,088
That we'd all win together.

109
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,281
We were stupid.

110
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,091
Y'all don't think you're being stupid
right now?

111
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,090
( Hammer clicks )

112
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,723
Are you saying
I should kill you?

113
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,326
I mean it, are you gonna try
and pull something on us?

114
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,484
Are we just being thick here
by not removing all doubt?

115
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,691
Right now, by me
not pulling this trigger,

116
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,320
is that a mistake?

117
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,324
I'm serious.
I really wanna know.

118
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,608
You made a choice
to kill for someone else,

119
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,009
to have them own you for a roof over
your head and three squares,

120
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,369
so maybe I'm not considering
all aspects here.

121
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,808
You tell me,
am I being stupid?

122
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,409
No.

123
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,564
Look, I got somewhere to be.

124
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,563
We can make a deal.
I can help you out.

125
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,690
You're one of them.

126
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,367
You're hurt and you're alone
and you'd say anything.

127
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,481
We should've never trusted
you people to begin with.

128
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,244
Go on.

129
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,051
Keep moving.

130
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,362
(walkers growling )

131
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,690
(walkers growling )

132
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,729
Son of a bitch.

133
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,609
( Growling continues )

134
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,690
Patty.

135
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,806
She could be...

136
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,565
(woman sighs )

137
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,408
No, she's gone.

138
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,289
Then we make another plan.

139
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,283
Yeah, we get out of here,
that's the plan.

140
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,930
Then that's the plan.

141
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,208
You guys didn't have
to do this for me.

142
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,603
It was the right thing
for all of us.

143
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,047
This was the right thing?

144
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,804
Even if just you guys
went back now,

145
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,327
if you just told them
that it was me...

146
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,289
No, we'll find a way.

147
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,408
- Just think about it.
- No.

148
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,291
Look, maybe we don't get as far,
but we'll get... hey!

149
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,601
- Hey. Hey, hey!
- Tina, hey!

150
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,880
Hey, baby sister,
look at me.

151
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,240
Hey, stop!
No!

152
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,447
( Gunshots )

153
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,728
Don't!
We need that, please!

154
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,811
( Panting )

155
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,610
Sasha, Abraham,
are you there?

156
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,808
( Static hissing )

157
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,328
(walker growling )

158
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,810
(growling )

159
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,482
( snarling )

160
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,840
( snarling continues )

161
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,571
( panting )

162
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,886
Sasha:
There, it's clear.

163
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,849
His bike's gone.

164
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,409
These are his shells.

165
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,722
He fired at 'em, got away.

166
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,887
He caught a good bounce.

167
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,891
There aren't
enough people around

168
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,731
to just wait around
for somebody to ambush.

169
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,640
And they couldn't have just been
watching us,

170
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,683
not with what we were doing.

171
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,731
Nah, they were looking to chew up
someone in particular.

172
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,207
Whoever the hell they were.

173
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,081
Daryl, you copy?

174
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,242
( Static hissing )

175
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,929
Daryl?

176
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,289
Dollars to doughnuts,
he's on his way back to Alexandria now.

177
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,881
- He wouldn't leave us behind.
- He already did.

178
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,929
But he came back.

179
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,242
So we go look for him.

180
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,085
The best way to find a tracker
is to stay put.

181
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,611
Let him find you.

182
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,886
You just want us to sit here

183
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,606
with our precious leathers
in our hands?

184
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,091
No.

185
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,768
(walker growling )

186
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,808
Don't.

187
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,291
What?

188
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,204
You're smarter than that.

189
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,371
We don't need
to leave bread crumbs.

190
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,610
( Door creaks )

191
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,444
( door closes )

192
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,730
( flashlight clicks )

193
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,965
( snarling )

194
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,806
How come gorgeous over here
is still standing?

195
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,928
He can't get out.

196
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,242
(thumping )

197
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,722
It's locked. We're fine.

198
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,409
Stand watch or sleep?
Your choice.

199
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,085
I'll take the former.

200
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,242
Do a little shopping, maybe.

201
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,243
( Thumping continues )

202
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,242
(growling )

203
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,607
( drawers rattling )

204
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,002
( walker snarls )

205
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,241
(growling )

206
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,807
( bag thuds )

207
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,291
Can't sleep?

208
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,166
What does it look like?

209
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,129
I just wanted to know
if it was a choice.

210
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,204
(walker growling )

211
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,124
( sighs )
You have no idea how much

212
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,204
I want to release that thing
from this plane of existence.

213
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,644
(walker growling )

214
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,043
( sighs, chuckles )

215
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,689
This our new home?

216
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,002
Should we give him a name?

217
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,128
You got yourself into this.

218
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,528
I was driving that car solo
until you chose to come with.

219
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,563
Oh, I didn't have a choice there.

220
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,489
Tell me why.

221
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,489
You going stag
was not an option.

222
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,650
Tell me why.

223
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,850
You were out of control
for a good while there.

224
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,922
Just about took my arm off
on the road to paradise.

225
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,606
- You remember that?
- I do.

226
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,881
- I'm in control now.
- Me, too.

227
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,128
That's why you wanna
kill that walker?

228
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,408
The one down the street?

229
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,289
The guys in the car?

230
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,010
'Cause you're in control.

231
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,482
'Cause loose ends
make my ass itch.

232
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,966
If I have not gotten
my psyche situated straight,

233
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,409
it's because the shit's continually
been hitting the fan without respite.

234
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,648
Oh, there's been respite.
There was a party.

235
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,131
Oh, I remember that.

236
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,931
You had the time
of your life there.

237
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,563
You don't have to throw yourself
out of a moving car...

238
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,246
to feel like
you're calling the ball.

239
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,890
That's easy.

240
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,562
You jump out of an airplane,
you don't have choices after that.

241
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,927
Maybe you play some chicken
with the ground,

242
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,404
but you pull the rip cord,
you live.

243
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,609
But if you have
a roof over your head,

244
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,770
you have food,
you have walls...

245
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,329
you have choices.

246
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,486
And without walkers and bullets

247
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,928
and shit hitting the fan,

248
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,482
you're accountable for them.

249
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,122
I mean, hell,
you're always accountable.

250
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,688
It's just with all that other noise,

251
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,003
you know people won't notice.

252
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,048
(growling )

253
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,211
Stand watch or sleep.

254
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,328
The former.

255
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,724
Straight through the night.

256
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,486
We'll reassess in the morning.

257
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,130
What do you mean?

258
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,288
What the hell we're doing here.

259
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,000
Drop the gun.
Drop it.

260
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,524
Give it to me.

261
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,886
I came all this way.
What you got for the duffel?

262
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,203
You put me through too much shit
just to give it back.

263
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,600
Principle of the thing.

264
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,842
What you got
besides this gun?

265
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,684
Nothing.

266
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,088
What was that thing
you were carving?

267
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,283
- My grandfather taught me how...
- Daryl: Don't care.

268
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,249
It'll do.

269
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,883
Take it.
It's all there.

270
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,922
Good luck.
You're gonna need it.

271
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,402
( Trees snapping )

272
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,404
( brakes squealing )

273
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,131
( truck door opens, closes )

274
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,129
Let's end this.

275
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,328
It's ours.

276
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,164
We earned what we took.

277
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,926
Man: You're gonna return
what you took.

278
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,924
You're gonna pay for the gas it took
to come out here

279
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,162
and for all the time
these men took out.

280
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,641
It's over.
You know the rules.

281
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,690
Your rules are batshit!

282
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,320
We're not going back, Wade.
We're done kneeling!

283
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,249
Don't change the subject,
asshole.

287
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,770
Come on.
Hey, that way.

288
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,604
Come on.
Go, go, go.

289
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,171
Go.

290
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,651
Get up.

He'! '

293
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,964
Take it.

294
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,484
- ( Walkie static hisses )
- Wade on walkie: Eyes open.

295
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,803
You cover your quadrant.
Go to alpha channel.

296
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,809
(growling )

297
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,241
( weakly )
Love you, Sher.

298
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,210
You didn't have to... for me.

- ( screaming )

302

Wade, I'm bit!

303
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,085
- Take it off me.
- Damn it.

304
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,402
Do it!
Just take it off!

305
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,042
Wade: I'll get
your watch after.

306
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,601
( Man screams, crying )

307
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,080
- ( walkie static hisses )
- Wade: All right, that's it.

308
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,645
Time to go home.

309
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,211
Cam got a boo-boo.

310
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,124
Man on radio:
Are you sure?

311
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:52,205
Wade: Oh, yeah. He only wanted
to take this so far.

312
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,802
And he only wants ass
that's willing, you know?

313
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,566
( Sobbing )

314
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,125
Come on, Cam.
Let's walk it off.

315
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,164
We thought
you were with them.

316
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,129
We knock you over the head,
tie you up,

317
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,248
threaten to kill you...

318
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,682
why the hell
did you come back?

319
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,763
( Grunting )
I don't know.

320
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,168
Maybe I'm stupid, too.

321
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,008
( Birds chirping )

322
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,160

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,685
Well, howdy, gentlemen.

325
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,204
( Growling continues )

( clattering )

328
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,129
RPG.

329
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,362
( Metal creaking )

330
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,361

(walker snarling,
thudding )

337
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,961
Sasha:
Where do you get that?

338
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:35,889
It is the fruit
of some off-the-chart stupidity.

339
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,562
Some grade-A,
butt steak idiocy.

340
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,770
Self-awareness
is a beautiful thing.

341
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,769
Yes, it is.

342
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,844
You see,
I know this group

343
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,162
and I know Rick.

344
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,368
And whatever happened
back there is being managed

345
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,241
and kicked right up into its own ass
one way or another. I know that.

346
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,324
We got beer...

347
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,921
and air conditioning...

348
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,171
and walls.

349
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,446
The table is set
for the rest of our lives,

350
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,922
and I hope those years
to be long and fruitful.

351
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,122
I see that time before me...

352
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,170
and I've been feeling the urge
to make some plays...

353
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:30,406
before the great cosmic Pete comes
to cut my throat unceremoniously

354
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,928
and I gurgle my last breath.

355
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,607
Well, things are gonna go on
for a while before that,

356
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,570
and that hadn't
occurred to me before.

357
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,405
I've been kind of living
check to check on that point.

358
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,643
I like the way
you call bullshit, Sasha.

359
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,122
I believe I'd like to get to know you
a whole lot better.

360

( Chuckles )

361
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,402
That one of your plays?

00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,010
What makes you think
I want that?

363
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,686
A man can tell.

364
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,968
(laughs)

365
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,010
Well...

366
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,684
( chuckles ) ...you got some stuff
to take care of.

367
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,930
Yeah.

368
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,923
I do.

369
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,443
Daryl:
So you know 'em?

370
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,045
Still you thought
I was one of them?

371
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,362
Where we were...
We were there since the beginning.

372
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,885
We still didn't know everyone.

373
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,806
Back when we first threw in with them,
it was as good as a place as any.

374
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,804
Then things got harder,
people got harder.

375
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,121
Human nature kicked in

376
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,171
and it became a truly unique
kind of shitshow.

377
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,051
People will trade
anything for safety,

378
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,565
for knowing that they're safe.

379
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,563
Everything.

380
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,564
So they got nothing left
except just...

381
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,324
existing.

382
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,006
Hey, nobody's safe anymore.

383
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,407
Can't promise people that anyhow.

384
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,040
You could promise the people
who want to hear it.

385
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,923
Hey, Tina, hold up.

386
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,321
Carla and Delly.

387
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,569
That's them.

388
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,768
Honey: Me and Tina used to babysit them
when they were kids.

389
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:00,447
Everyone said that they went out north
when it all started.

390
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,125
We didn't know.

391
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,361
I did this.

392
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,922
We did this.

393
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,129
- ( Growling )
- ( screaming )

394
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,767
- ( screaming )
- ( sobbing )

395
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,571
I'm sorry!
'(coughs)

396
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,849
I'm so sorry, baby.
We had to try.

397
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,162
We had to try.
We had to.

398
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,005
( Honey sobbing )
I'm so sorry.

399
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,164
I'm sorry.

400
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,004
I'm...

401
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,089
He'! '

402
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,009
How many walkers
you killed?

403
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,762
- Just answer the question.
- A lot.

404
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,769
A couple dozen at least.

405
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,167
How many people you killed?

406
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,527
None.

407
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,444
Why?

408
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,125
Why haven't I killed anybody?

409
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,887
Because if I did,
there'd be no going back.

410
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,131
There'd be no going back
to how things were.

411
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,803
I'm from a place

412
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,248
where people are
still like they were...

413
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,882
more or less,
better or worse.

414
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,482
I can walk it from here.

415
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,206
Till we meet up with my friends.
( grunts )

416
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,204
They got a car.
You can ride with them.

417
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,771
How many friends
you say there were?

418
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,447
I didn't.
There's two of 'em.

419
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,841
Where are they?

420
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,526
We're gonna find out.

421
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,445
How do you know they even got away?
That they didn't get taken?

422
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,568
I don't.

423
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,247
- ( Hammer clicks )
- Oh, damn it.

424
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,409
I'm sorry.

425
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,929
Give her the crossbow.

426
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,367
You gonna go back?

427
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,369
- You gonna be safe?
- Shut up.

428
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,130
Ain't nowhere safe no more.

429
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,930
Give her the crossbow.

430
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,287
You gonna kneel?

431
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,044
(gunshot)

432
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,163
( engine starts )

433
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,003
Patch yourself up.

434
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,760
We're sorry.

435
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,684
You're gonna be.

436
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,282
( Growling softly )

437
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,125
(growling )

438
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,284
( growling stops )

439
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,282
- ( walker growling )
- Look at this.

440
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,880
What?

441
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,960
Nothing.

442
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,805
( Truck approaches )

443
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,642
( truck engine stops )

444
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,801
( chuckles )

445
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,842
Rick, you COPY?

446
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,809
( Static hissing )

447
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,769
Daryl:
Anybody?

448
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,201
( Static hissing )

449
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,522
( garbled voice over radio )

450
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,364
Daryl:
Say it again?

451
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,841
( Static hissing )

452
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,365
Man on walkie:
Help.

453
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,602
( Static hissing )

454
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,004
( theme music playing )
