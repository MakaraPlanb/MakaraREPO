00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,403
You said you liked talking.

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,289
I remember that.

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,881
"Little chats with a stranger
by the fire."

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,208
You said it was like
the movies.

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,248
Then you said that you want
everything that I have.

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,248
Every last bit.

8
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,364
Well, here it is.

9
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,730
Every last bit.

10
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,646
Morgan:
You don't clear.

11
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,131
You don't.

12
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,928
No.

13
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,401
No, no.

14
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,289
You don't.

15
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,009
You don't.

16
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,481
It doesn't matter
how many days...

17
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,002
or how much time.

18
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,085
We weren't supposed
to be there.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,163
You had the knife.

20
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,806
You had the gun!

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,131
You were supposed to.

22
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,966
You know you were
supposed to.

23
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,169
Don't lie.

24
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,410
You know.

25
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,246
You know that
you were supposed to!

( choking )

37

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

38
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,486
No! I'm sorry.

( Gasping )

40
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,962
You don't.
You don't.

41
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,642
You don't!
You know you don't!

( murmuring )
You're still the same.

46
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,965
You're... you're still doing it.

47
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,807
You know what it is.

48
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,007
You know what it is.

( bleating continues )

53
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,210
Man: Can you step away
from the goat?

54
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,011
She's not yours.
And I still need her.

55
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,407
I'm still figuring out
how to make cheese.

56
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,841
Why don't you put the gun down
and we'll talk?

57
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,163
Have some falafel?

58
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,322
Looks like you haven't
eaten for a while.

59
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,449
Really, put down the rifle,
let's talk.

60
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,409
I'm sure we can work this out.

61
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,645
Okay, last chance.

62
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,043
Lower your gun,
step away from the cabin.

63
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,928
( Door rattles )

64
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,881
(grunts)

65
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,285
Sorry.

( door opens )

68
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,689
What's your name?

69
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,442
Kill me.

70
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,211
Well, that's a stupid name.

71
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,850
It's dangerous.

72
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,525
You should change it.

73
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,802
Kill me.

74
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,166
Kill me!

75
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,368
( Hammering )

76
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,049
Kill me!

77
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,409
Kill me!
Kill me!

78
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,688
( Sighs )

79
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,842
Kill me.

80
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,729
My name's Eastman.

81
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,008
( Distant cans rattling )

82
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,849
( goat bleating )

83
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,886
- ( door opens )
- Eastman: It's okay, Tabitha.

84
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,725
- Eastman: Aw, shit.
- ( walker snarling )

85
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,769
( hammering )

86
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,287
It's yours.

87
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,125
Take it.

88
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,442
It's yours or his.

89
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,409
So you take it.

90
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,762
16 hours
in 19 on the floor.

91
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,763
You know what it is.

92
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,570
( Bleats)

93
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,083
You shot at me.
I fed you.

94
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,969
Please don't hurt her.

95
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,691
Good night.

96
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,448
- ( Goat bleats )
- Shh. Shh.

97
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,446
( Door closes )

98
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,170
( lock clicks )

99
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,000
( snarls )

100
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,162
( squelches )

101
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,327
16 hours
in 19 on the floor.

102
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,091
Oh!

103
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,242
Oh, that is...

104
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,402
Oh, that's terrible!

105
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,609
That... oh, God,
that is...

106
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,364
That is terrible.

107
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,204
(gags)

108
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,929
I just wanted to wait a little while
before we talked.

109
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,246
I'm from Atlanta.

110
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,762
I'm a forensic psychiatrist.

111
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,049
The state employed me to determine if
certain people who did very bad things

112
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,766
would do them again
if they were released from prison.

113
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,920
That was my job.
Now I live here,

114
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:52,407
because of the state of the state
and the whole world.

115
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,847
What did you do
or what do you do now?

116
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,248
I clear.

117
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,289
What the hell does that mean?

118
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,124
Walkers, people,

119
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,124
anything that gets
anywhere near me,

120
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,285
I kill 'em.
I clear.

121
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,962
Why?

122
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,329
Because that's why
I'm still here.

123
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,642
Well...

124
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,167
that's the biggest load
of horseshit I ever heard.

125
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,969
Here's your lunch.

126
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,724
( Tab snaps )

127
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,201
( goat bleats )

128
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,723
It's PTSD.

129
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,451
You've been through
trauma, right?

130
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,251
You see that blood
on the end of my stick?

131
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,925
At the sharp end?

132
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,208
That was two men.

133
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,966
Father and son, maybe.

134
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,521
I stabbed one
through the throat.

135
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,924
He just fell to the ground
with it stuck in him,

136
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,367
trying to breathe
through the blood.

137
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,242
Other one I strangled.
No rope, just my hands.

138
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,968
That was the day
before I came here.

139
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,122
Maybe...

140
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,606
Maybe the same day.

141
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,491
I... I don't know.

142
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,641
But that's what I did.

143
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,604
That's what I do.

144
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,286
You killed a lot of people?

145
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,965
Yes.

146
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,849
They were threatening you,
attacking you?

147
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,843
Not all of them.

148
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,764
You save anyone?

149
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,486
You saved people.

150
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,126
Pointless acts.

151
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,967
Everybody turns.

152
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,849
I saw a wedding ring.

153
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,771
You had someone
you loved, didn't you?

154
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,163
Children?

155
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,362
Oh.

156
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,205
You loved them.

157
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,647
You loved them a lot
if you're like this.

158
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,645
You saw it happen.

159
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,644
That's how this started, right?

160
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,004
It's all happening right in front
of your eyes over and over.

161
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,650
Your body's here,

162
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,968
but your mind is still there.

163
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,444
There's a door and you want to go
through it to get away from it,

164
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,725
so you do and it leads you
right back to that moment.

165
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,566
And you see that door again
and you know it won't work,

166
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,840
but, hell, maybe it'll work.

167
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,325
So you step through that door

168
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,643
and you're right back
in that horrible moment every time.

169
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,370
You still feel it every time.

170
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,251
So you just want to stop
opening that door.

171
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,051
So you just sit in it.

172
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,043
But I assure you,

173
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,043
one of those doors
leads out, my friend.

174
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,521
I don't have any friends.

175
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,091
Get to know me.

176
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,844
Oh, I'm gonna kill you.

177
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,526
- Why?
- Because I have to clear.

178
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,530
See, that's the thing.
You don't.

179
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,326
( Scoffs )
We're not built to kill.

180
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,768
We don't have claws
or fangs or armor.

181
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,046
Vets that came back
with PTSD,

182
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,567
that didn't happen
because we're comfortable with killing.

183
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,007
We're not.
We can't be.

184
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,049
We feel.
We're connected.

185
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,767
You know, I've interviewed
over 825 people

186
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,686
who've done terrible things.
I've only met one evil person.

187
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,411
Some of them were born
with bad brains.

188
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,608
Some of them got sick
along the way.

189
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,569
The rest were
just damaged people,

190
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,371
traumatized themselves, like you,
but they could heal.

191
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,761
Some more, some less,
but they can.

192
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,763
We all can.

193
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,403
I know it.

194
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,926
It's all a circle
and everything gets a return.

195
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,168
The door is open.

196
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,927
That door right there.
The cell door, it's open.

197
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,242
I threw the key
in the river a while back.

198
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,323
I'm not gonna hold you anymore.

199
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,326
I can't stop you.
Go, clear.

200
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,608
Or stay,
crash on the couch,

201
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,650
and we'll try
to find you another way.

202
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,802
The door's open.

203
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,764
It's been open all along.

204
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,090
You stay or you go.

205
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,083
Those are the choices.

206
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,449
I will not allow you to kill me.

207
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,642
I will not allow that.

208
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,641
Eastman:
Don't!

209
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,330
Stop.

210
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,482
(growling )

211
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,489
( groans )

212
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,682
- Stop.
- ( Morgan growling )

213
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,968
I gave you two choices.

214
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,968
Oh, shit.

215
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,202
( Groans )

216
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,011
(grunting )

217
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,889
( choking )

218
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,601
( gasping )

219
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,528
Kill me.

220
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,246
I gave you two choices.

221
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,801
The door or the couch.

222
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,122
( Hammering )

223
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,640
That was aikido.

224
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,842
That's how I kicked
your ass earlier.

225
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,606
Well, that's how
I redirected your ass.

226
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,845
The people in prison
I evaluated for the state,

227
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,571
the stories I heard,

228
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,724
the things these people did...

229
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,882
One night,
my five-year-old daughter

230
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:18,807
found me crying in the garage
after about eight beers.

231
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,849
Told her I wasn't feeling too good.

232
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,409
She gave me this.

233
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,729
She had won it at a carnival
at school that day.

234
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,527
She said it'd make me lucky
and I'd feel better.

235
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,729
The next morning I found
a flyer for aikido.

236
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,763
Damn thing worked.

237
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,568
Your wife
and your daughter...

238
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,448
they're dead?

239
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,046
It was aikido.

240
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,765
It'll help.

241
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:12,086
And you obviously need help
if we're gonna make this trip.

242
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,765
Can't just be
me and you to the end.

243
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,406
You're a shit conversationalist.

244
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,042
And I can't make
this trip by myself.

245
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,964
A trip where?

246
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,404
I have no idea.

247
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,090
Good night.

248
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,440
( Door closes )

249
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,170
( lock clicks )

250
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,208
( birds chirping )

251
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,201
Grassy notes are a little
too Astroturf,

252
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,203
but there's potential here.

253
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,806
There is always potential.

254
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,008
Where there's life,
there's potential.

255
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,688
I've been a vegetarian
for a while now.

256
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,526
I was afraid that damn goat
was gonna make me a vegan.

257
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,002
I don't kill, but I'm not giving up
on chocolate any time soon.

258
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,963
You might notice I'm not giving up
on the Goo Goo Clusters.

259
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,400
They're gonna
remain on the menu.

260
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,683
You should try one.
They're good.

261
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,888
Come on, you're alive.
Live a little.

262
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,560
We should go out.

263
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,566
We got a lot here, but we should
scavenge some things up for the trip.

264
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,210
You coming?

265
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,367
Will you watch Tabitha
while I'm gone?

266
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,209
Can you do that for me?

267
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,404
( Sighs )

268
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,361
( door opens )

269
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,362
- ( goat bleats )
- ( door closes )

270
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,722
( distant cans rattling )

271
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,962
( walkers snarling )

272
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,282
( goat bleating )

273
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,489
- ( goat screaming )
- ( walkers snarling )

274
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,286
- ( walkers snarling )
- ( goat screaming )

275
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,322
( breathing echoes )

276
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,323
( goat bleating )

277
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,288
( roaring )

278
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,050
(grunts)

279
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,366
( wings flutter)

280
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,091
( birds cawing, chirping )

281
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,843
Well, you maimed
a tomato plant,

282
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,129
but it looks to me like you saved
a goat today, my friend.

283
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,800
He'! '

284
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,167
Thank you.

285
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,003
Progress.

286
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,689
Just a second.

287
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,561
( Sighs )
A and B.

288
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,041
A... you broke
the garden fence,

289
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,009
laid waste to a perfectly good
tomato plant.

290
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,571
You got to fix it.

291
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,849
B... follow me.

292
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,088
Fixed your spear.

293
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,566
Eastman:
It's about redirecting.

294
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,121
Morgan:
Evading.

295
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,760
(grunting )

296
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,084
Eastman: And actually caring
about the welfare of your opponent.

297
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,806
Morgan: So you have to care
about yourself.

298
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,286
Eastman: You have to believe
your life is precious,

299
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,842
that all life is precious.

300
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,765
Morgan: You have to redirect
those thoughts,

301
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,321
the history
that tells you otherwise.

302
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,209
Eastman: What we've done,
we've done.

303
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,320
Morgan: We evade it
by moving forward

304
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,847
with a code
to never to do it again.

305
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,002
Eastman:
To make up for it.

306
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,011
Morgan: To still accept
what we were.

307
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,806
He'! '

308
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,926
Eastman:
To accept everyone.

309
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,243
Morgan:
To protect everyone.

310
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,041
Eastman: And in doing that,
protect yourself.

311
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,771
Morgan:
To create peace.

312
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,531
Why do you have a cell
in your cabin?

313
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,603
Built this place
with my wife

314
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,246
a while before
our daughter was born.

315
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,084
It didn't have
a cell back then.

316
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,242
That was just the other side
of the living room.

317
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,248
In my job I interviewed
over 800 men and 25 women

318
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,607
convicted of awful things,

319
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,970
stuff from the darkest part
of the human soul.

320
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:49,728
I was evaluating a man by the name
of Crighton Dallas Wilton.

321
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,405
( Chuckles )

322
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,245
Name like that, sounded like he should
own an oil company

323
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,926
and wear a big hat...
Crighton Dallas Wilton.

324
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,603
Despite doing some truly unspeakable
acts, he was up for parole.

325
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,924
And he was one of the most damn likable
people I had ever met.

326
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,481
He said all the right things,
he went to therapy.

327
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,849
He wrote letters to the prison board
to start a program

328
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,483
to grow flowers for the waiting rooms
in state hospitals, rest homes.

329
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,481
And I saw
right through him.

330
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,483
Saw that he was
a true psychopath,

331
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,610
that he knew how to play people,
exactly how to play people.

332
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,809
I was interviewing him
next to the cafeteria.

333
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,849
The place smelled
of industrial pizza.

334
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,331
They were polishing
the floor.

335
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,371
I had to shout my questions
half the time.

336
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,204
And there was this moment.

337
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,807
Can't even remember
the exchange.

338
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,686
But right then I knew
that Crighton knew

339
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,531
that I knew exactly what he was.

340
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,001
Everything he had said, done

341
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,131
to hide away what he was
from everyone, from himself,

342
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,487
just slipped away, and...

343
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,288
and that model prisoner
of 10 years stood up,

344
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,562
smiled,

345
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,882
and just cracked me
across the face.

346
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,522
His fist felt like a rock.

347
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,002
Then he was on top of me
and the floor polisher next door

348
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,850
was thudding out
every sound.

349
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,331
And I...

350
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,530
And I saw his face,

351
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,526
his... his eyes,

352
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,364
his evil.

353
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,731
Mask had slipped.

354
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,362
And he was gonna kill me
right then and there

355
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,729
because he knew I would make sure
he would never get out again.

356
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,046
Arm bar counter

357
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,290
for being choked
from a pinned position.

358
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,249
Aikido.

359
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:12,284
I wasn't taking it for self-defense,
but it saved my life.

360
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,761
And I got to make sure
he never got out again.

361
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,283
Well, got to try.

362
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,602
He got out.

363
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,922
Talked to the right people
who got him the right things

364
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,242
and he broke out,
but it wasn't to escape.

365
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,922
Crighton Dallas Wilton
went to my home

366
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,607
and killed my wife,
my daughter, and my son.

367
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,286
He walked down the street
to the police station around the corner,

368
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,171
covered in their blood.

369
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,448
He surrendered.

370
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,127
Said the only reason
he broke out

371
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,248
was to destroy my life.

372
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,329
A year passed...

373
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,970
and he was still working
those plots.

374
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:11,331
They just let him work those plots
by the roads out by 85,

375
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,649
grow chrysanthemums,
forget-me-nots.

376
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,486
I built that cell
with the full intention

377
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,167
of bringing
Crighton Dallas Wilton here,

378
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,642
putting him behind those bars
and watching him starve to death.

379
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,443
And did you?

380
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,004
I have come to believe

381
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,845
that all life is precious.

382
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,048
Even for a man like that?

383
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,362
Who did that to you?

384
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,523
To your family?

385
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,331
I have come to believe

386
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,530
that all life
is precious.

387
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,044
That's why we're having
oatmeal burgers.

388
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,363
You're good at it.

389
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,730
Redirecting.

390
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,561
We need more gear.

391
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,370
Tarp, crowbar.

392
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,285
I'm thinking we could try
for the islands off the coast.

393
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,249
I think people
could have gone there.

394
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,880
Hell, at the very least,
we could see the beach.

395
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,123
What is it?

396
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,561
I know where we can find all that.

397
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,568
Who did you lose?

398
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,289
My wife and son.

399
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,689
Who you lost.

400
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,444
Their names.

401
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,483
Jenny and Duane.

402
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,484
I'm sorry.

403
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,327
Don't ever be sorry.

404
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,041
Forms, right now.

405
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,645
Not here.

406
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,167
Right now.

407
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,325
(grunts)

408
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,521
( breathing heavily )

409
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,404
(grunts)

410
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,048
You're gonna hold
a baby again.

411
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,770
(grunts)

412
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,571
(walker snarling )

413
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,730
( snarling )

414
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,928
It's all yours.

415
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,444
Damn it, move!

416
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,443
Ow!

417
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:40,928
I said not here.

418
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,844
That wasn't for you to do.

419
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,004
How could you do that?
That wasn't for you to do!

420
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,803
You can't just...

421
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,644
You can't just step in!

422
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,809
Tell me how it is.

423
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,123
Tell me how it is!
Tell me!

424
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,486
Let's go home.

425
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,644
I'm not going anywhere.

426
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,644
You're coming back.

427
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,842
You are done with this.

428
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,328
You made it out.

429
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,007
Ow!

430
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,208
( Roaring )

431
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,848
(grunting )

432
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,403
Kill me.

433
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,689
Kill me!

434
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,403
(grunts)

435
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,887
I said not here.

436
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:25,562
Well, that's the thing, Morgan.

437
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,289
Here's not here.

438
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,920
( Panting )

439
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,325
(walker snarling )

440
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,489
( squelches )

441
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:39,761
( growls )

442
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,321
(whimpers )
No.

443
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,170
Thank you.

444
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,528
(walker snarling )

445
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,887
( panting )

446
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,691
Oh, she got out.

447
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,930
( Sighs ) She figured out
the door was open, too.

448
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,560
I didn't figure it out.

449
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,888
You had to tell me.

450
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,364
Glad you're back.

451
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,891
Here.

452
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,808
Come on, you sit down
before you fall down.

453
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,802
Eastman:
Well, like I said, they...

454
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,970
let him work
the plots beside 85.

455
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,608
Even after what he did.

456
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,162
They let him because
he was so damn charming.

457
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,800
I found out
the schedule, waited,

458
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,531
made sure the right people
were working.

459
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:53,161
I got him in my car quick
and brought him back here.

460
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,321
If they'd have caught me,
it'd have been fine.

461
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,123
It'd have been better.

462
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:11,041
But I got him here
and they didn't know where to look.

463
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,480
( Exhales )

464
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,041
You gotta sit down.

465
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,567
All right.
(winces )

466
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,324
I'm okay.

467
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,048
( Exhales )

468
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,360
I put him in that cell...

469
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:35,927
and I let him starve to death.

470
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,606
It took 47 days.

471
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:48,568
And then I was gone.

472
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,200
I was where you were.

473
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:54,682
And I wasn't trying to open up
the door anymore either.

474
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,729
What I did to him,

475
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,042
it didn't give me any peace.

476
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,971
I found my peace

477
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:09,522
when I decided
to never kill again.

478
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,811
To never kill
anything again.

479
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,970
When I decided
to settle things,

480
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:22,442
I went back to Atlanta
to turn myself in.

481
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:25,251
That's how I found out
the world ended.

482
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,641
But the world hasn't ended.

483
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,563
Progress.

484
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,444
My daughter drew this
on the hallway wall of our house.

485
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,602
She thought I'd get mad.

486
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,802
I just put a frame around it.

487
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:01,282
After I went back, when I found out
I couldn't turn myself in

488
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,250
because there was no one
to turn myself in to,

489
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,649
I went back home
to cut this from the wall.

490
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,644
I lost the car on the way back.

491
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:15,840
I walked through 30 miles of the dead
for a piece of drywall.

492
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,844
(laughs)

493
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,321
Scariest thing I ever did.

494
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,482
Best thing I ever did.

495
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,648
( Sighs )

496
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,683
You can stay here.

497
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:35,327
You have enough food,
power, security.

498
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:37,687
For the rest of your life,
you could stay here.

499
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:40,810
But you shouldn't stay here.

500
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:44,851
Can't expect such a splendid guest
as yourself to show up.

501
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,122
You stay here,
you'll be alone.

502
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,160
You were alone.

503
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,806
Everything is about people.

504
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,483
Everything in this life
that's worth a damn.

505
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:02,484
It couldn't be just me.
It shouldn't be just you.

506
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:07,843
Hell, Tabitha's gone now.

507
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,047
( Sighs )
I'm ready.

508
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,041
I have a gun in
the lockbox out there.

509
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:23,885
Here.

510
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,407
( labored breathing )

511
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:32,449
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

512
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,360
Hope it's lucky for you, too,

513
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,602
whatever you decide.

514
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,442
I've decided.

515
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,208
And that's it.

516
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,762
Every last bit.

517
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:30,410
You think it can work out
that way with me?

518
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,370
Yes.

519
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,090
I think it can.

520
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:39,241
( Chuckles )

521
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,562
Maybe.

522
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:45,042
You noticed
I'm shaking a little?

523
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:48,927
Sweating a little?

524
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,366
Oh, man.

525
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,767
( Sighs )

526
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:03,130
I saw how settled this place was
in the pictures I found.

527
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:09,723
I thought maybe there'd be
something here.

528
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:13,168
Medicine to help this.

529
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:18,930
But that was before
you people won.

530
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:26,282
So I know I'm probably
going to die.

531
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:28,488
But if I don't...

532
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,609
I am going to have
to kill you, Morgan.

533
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:38,322
I'm going to have to kill
every person here.

534
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:41,967
Every one of them.
The children, too.

535
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:46,364
Just like your friend
Eastman's children.

536
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,805
Those are the rules.

537
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,167
That's my code.

538
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,288
I'd say I'm sorry,

539
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,011
but you said it, right?

540
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,688
Don't ever be sorry.

541
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:38,207
(keys jingle)

542
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:44,686
( lock clicks )

543
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:58,330
Rick:
Open the gate!

544
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:00,363
