1
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:48,693
Do you have any toothpaste left?

2
00:00:49,295 --> 00:00:50,794
No,

3
00:00:50,796 --> 00:00:54,048
'cause someone's been borrowing
it every day for two weeks.

4
00:00:55,885 --> 00:00:57,217
Carl.

5
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:59,853
What? Denise says it's PT.

6
00:00:59,855 --> 00:01:02,189
I can't hear you. Come on out.

7
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,226
What?

8
00:01:06,228 --> 00:01:09,697
Denise says this is PT.

9
00:01:09,699 --> 00:01:12,533
- You heard me.
- Yeah.

10
00:01:12,535 --> 00:01:14,401
It's time to change
your bandage.

11
00:01:14,403 --> 00:01:15,986
And I need to borrow
some toothpaste.

12
00:01:15,988 --> 00:01:18,205
Okay, but I'm out of toothpaste.

13
00:01:18,207 --> 00:01:20,991
- Bye, Dad.
- I'll see you later.

14
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,250
Come on, sweetheart.

15
00:01:32,421 --> 00:01:35,089
- You be good out there.
- Yeah, we'll see.

16
00:01:35,091 --> 00:01:36,924
And thank you.

17
00:01:36,926 --> 00:01:38,309
Oh.

18
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:41,178
Spearmint and baking soda.
That's my favorite.

19
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,063
Soon as I get it, you will.

20
00:01:53,976 --> 00:01:56,443
- Hey.
- Yes?

21
00:01:56,445 --> 00:01:57,645
This thing at the bottom
right here.

22
00:01:57,647 --> 00:01:59,380
You're talking
about the drink, right?

23
00:01:59,382 --> 00:02:01,281
I am, but...

24
00:02:03,085 --> 00:02:05,002
It's not medical.

25
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:09,790
No, I drew a line between
the important stuff and that.

26
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,626
I just figured, if you saw it.

27
00:02:12,628 --> 00:02:13,827
All right.

28
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:15,963
Anything remotely
medical is a priority.

29
00:02:15,965 --> 00:02:17,881
And food, maybe even
food before medicine,

30
00:02:17,883 --> 00:02:21,719
and gas or batteries or books for
the kids or clothes is just...

31
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:25,139
if you see it,
if it just happens to,

32
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:27,057
you know, be right there.

33
00:02:27,059 --> 00:02:29,059
You like it, right?

34
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:30,611
No, I don't drink pop.

35
00:02:30,613 --> 00:02:31,812
What the hell's pop?

36
00:02:31,814 --> 00:02:33,947
Oh, I'm originally from Ohio.

37
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:38,052
Why you want it?

38
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:45,492
Tara was talking about it
in her sleep, I think.

39
00:02:45,494 --> 00:02:48,662
Either she likes it
or she doesn't,

40
00:02:48,664 --> 00:02:53,634
but if she likes it, it'd
be a really nice surprise.

41
00:02:53,636 --> 00:02:55,886
I'm not good with
that kind of stuff,

42
00:02:55,888 --> 00:02:57,571
and she and Heath are going
on that two-week run.

43
00:02:57,573 --> 00:03:00,340
I just thought it'd be
a nice going-away present.

44
00:03:00,342 --> 00:03:03,260
Just, uh, don't
go out of your way.

45
00:03:03,262 --> 00:03:05,729
And if it gives you
any trouble...

46
00:03:05,731 --> 00:03:06,914
I won't.

47
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,449
Okay, good, 'cause
it's not important.

48
00:03:08,451 --> 00:03:10,567
I should've said so instead
of just drawing a line.

49
00:03:13,105 --> 00:03:14,571
Got it.

50
00:03:42,384 --> 00:03:45,969
I mapped out some of the agricultural
supply places in the area.

51
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:47,521
Even if they've
been cleaned out,

52
00:03:47,523 --> 00:03:49,807
my bet is that the sorghum
would be untouched.

53
00:03:49,809 --> 00:03:51,642
Now, that there is a
criminally underrated grain

54
00:03:51,644 --> 00:03:55,062
that could change the game with our food
situation from scary to hunky-dunky.

55
00:03:59,869 --> 00:04:03,203
I'm talking standability,
drought tolerance,

56
00:04:03,205 --> 00:04:06,490
grain-to-stover ratio
that is the envy of all corns.

57
00:04:09,295 --> 00:04:10,878
Think about it.

58
00:04:12,748 --> 00:04:14,998
- Thanks.
- All right.

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,800
Okay.

60
00:04:42,545 --> 00:04:44,845
- Today's the day.
- Uh-huh.

61
00:04:44,847 --> 00:04:48,182
We're gonna find
food, maybe some people.

62
00:04:48,184 --> 00:04:50,918
The law of averages
has gotta catch up.

63
00:04:52,855 --> 00:04:55,689
I don't know. We ain't
seen nobody for weeks.

64
00:04:55,691 --> 00:04:58,125
Maybe we ain't gonna
find nobody.

65
00:04:58,127 --> 00:04:59,793
Maybe that's a good thing.

66
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,970
Don't.

67
00:05:09,972 --> 00:05:11,171
Don't.

68
00:05:11,173 --> 00:05:12,372
Please don't.

69
00:05:13,976 --> 00:05:15,976
Give me the downbeat, maestro.

70
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,751
Draws 'em away from home!

72
00:06:56,453 --> 00:06:58,620
Hey.

73
00:07:03,575 --> 00:07:05,408
Where have you been?

74
00:07:06,618 --> 00:07:08,418
What?

75
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,920
I never see you.

76
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:11,621
Everybody's been
working for weeks

77
00:07:11,623 --> 00:07:12,922
to get this place back together

78
00:07:12,924 --> 00:07:14,924
and you just disappear.

79
00:07:17,095 --> 00:07:19,546
- Do you sit in your room all day?
- No.

80
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:22,599
Then where'd you go?

81
00:07:22,601 --> 00:07:24,133
Nowhere.

82
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:29,105
You helped Glenn get home.

83
00:07:29,107 --> 00:07:31,808
You helped me when I was
up in that guard post.

84
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:34,027
Yeah?

85
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:35,728
So maybe there are better places

86
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,481
for you to go than just nowhere.

87
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:43,620
I'm around.

88
00:07:43,622 --> 00:07:45,655
Come talk to me.

89
00:08:42,964 --> 00:08:44,881
Hey, hold up.

90
00:08:44,883 --> 00:08:47,050
It's best to be safe.

91
00:08:47,052 --> 00:08:49,302
- You cover it?
- Yeah.

92
00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:00,947
Yeah, we're good.

93
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:02,799
One more time?

94
00:09:02,801 --> 00:09:04,400
It ain't locked.

95
00:09:16,631 --> 00:09:18,548
Well, how about that?

96
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:22,752
The law of averages.

97
00:09:22,754 --> 00:09:24,420
Yep.

98
00:09:29,094 --> 00:09:31,344
Let's get this thing going,

99
00:09:31,346 --> 00:09:34,430
grab our gear, come
back for the car later.

100
00:09:34,432 --> 00:09:36,599
Take another way back.

101
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:39,435
See what we can see.

102
00:09:39,437 --> 00:09:40,937
Think it'll start?

103
00:09:40,939 --> 00:09:42,572
Yeah, I do.

104
00:09:42,574 --> 00:09:45,525
Sorghum.

105
00:10:33,558 --> 00:10:35,458
Yo, give me a hand with this.

106
00:10:39,664 --> 00:10:41,164
Ahem.

107
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,965
Let's flip it over.

108
00:10:50,141 --> 00:10:52,241
I don't think we got it.

109
00:11:01,686 --> 00:11:03,486
I got an idea.

110
00:11:24,676 --> 00:11:27,276
It's soda and candy.
Why the trouble?

111
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:28,978
It wasn't any trouble.

112
00:11:33,551 --> 00:11:35,434
Hi.

113
00:11:40,926 --> 00:11:42,523
Back up! Now!

114
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:43,533
Keep 'em up!

115
00:11:43,558 --> 00:11:45,363
Whoa, easy, guys.

116
00:11:45,365 --> 00:11:47,932
I was just running
from the dead.

117
00:11:47,934 --> 00:11:49,167
How many?

118
00:11:49,169 --> 00:11:51,169
10, maybe more.

119
00:11:51,171 --> 00:11:52,787
I'm not risking it.

120
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:54,906
Once it gets to double
digits, I start running.

121
00:11:54,908 --> 00:11:56,674
Where?

122
00:11:56,676 --> 00:11:58,543
About a half a mile back.

123
00:11:58,545 --> 00:12:00,044
They're headed this way.

124
00:12:00,046 --> 00:12:02,680
You probably have
about 11 minutes.

125
00:12:07,053 --> 00:12:10,688
Okay, thanks
for letting us know.

126
00:12:11,925 --> 00:12:13,191
Yeah.

127
00:12:13,193 --> 00:12:15,293
There's more of them
than us, right?

128
00:12:15,295 --> 00:12:17,061
Gotta stick together.

129
00:12:19,332 --> 00:12:20,698
Right?

130
00:12:26,706 --> 00:12:28,106
You have a camp?

131
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,242
No.

132
00:12:31,244 --> 00:12:33,328
Do you?

133
00:12:34,714 --> 00:12:36,164
No.

134
00:12:38,285 --> 00:12:39,717
Sorry for running into you.

135
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:41,252
I'm gonna go now.

136
00:12:41,254 --> 00:12:45,089
If this is the next world,
I hope it's good to you guys.

137
00:12:45,091 --> 00:12:48,126
I'm Rick. This is Daryl.

138
00:12:48,128 --> 00:12:50,311
What's your name?

139
00:12:54,684 --> 00:12:56,935
Paul Rovia.

140
00:12:56,937 --> 00:12:59,270
But my friends
used to call me Jesus.

141
00:12:59,272 --> 00:13:00,738
Your pick.

142
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,508
You said you didn't have a camp.

143
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,510
You on your own?

144
00:13:05,512 --> 00:13:06,978
Yeah.

145
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,248
But, still, best not
to try anything.

146
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,483
Best not to make threats
you can't keep, either.

147
00:13:12,485 --> 00:13:14,836
Exactly.

148
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,023
- How many walkers...
- No, not this guy.

149
00:13:19,025 --> 00:13:20,859
How many walkers
have you killed?

150
00:13:20,861 --> 00:13:23,628
Sorry, gotta run.
You should, too.

151
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,264
Think you've got
about seven minutes.

152
00:13:28,552 --> 00:13:30,101
What the hell was that?

153
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:31,519
He was clean.

154
00:13:31,521 --> 00:13:34,022
His beard, it was trimmed.

155
00:13:34,024 --> 00:13:36,558
There's more going on there.

156
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,142
He didn't have a gun, either.

157
00:13:38,144 --> 00:13:40,612
We could track him,
watch him for a while,

158
00:13:40,614 --> 00:13:42,480
get to know more.

159
00:13:42,482 --> 00:13:44,182
See if he's really alone.

160
00:13:44,184 --> 00:13:46,284
Maybe bring him back.

161
00:13:46,286 --> 00:13:48,753
Nah, guy calls himself Jesus.

162
00:14:03,553 --> 00:14:05,386
Firecrackers.

163
00:14:05,388 --> 00:14:06,888
- Hell.
- Shit.

164
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,423
He swiped your keys, didn't he?

165
00:14:08,425 --> 00:14:10,341
Oh, shit!

166
00:14:10,343 --> 00:14:12,577
Sorry!

167
00:14:25,292 --> 00:14:27,058
Shit.

168
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,830
Come on.

169
00:14:32,832 --> 00:14:34,198
Come on.

170
00:14:47,781 --> 00:14:49,380
I got him.

171
00:14:58,608 --> 00:15:00,825
You think I couldn't get it?

172
00:15:00,827 --> 00:15:02,026
You could've.

173
00:15:02,028 --> 00:15:04,195
I have a sword.

174
00:15:04,197 --> 00:15:06,597
Mm.

175
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:08,633
What are you doing out here?

176
00:15:08,635 --> 00:15:12,103
I was on guard. I saw
someone was in the woods.

177
00:15:12,105 --> 00:15:14,238
What are you doing out here?

178
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,741
I walk after my shifts.

179
00:15:16,743 --> 00:15:19,911
I've been doing it for a while.

180
00:15:19,913 --> 00:15:22,046
You're the first one to notice.

181
00:15:24,968 --> 00:15:27,218
Why the shovel?

182
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:31,723
I'm gonna keep walking now.

183
00:15:31,725 --> 00:15:33,224
I'm gonna come with you.

184
00:15:33,226 --> 00:15:34,926
That's okay.

185
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:41,599
Your mom told me I had to
figure out what I want...

186
00:15:41,601 --> 00:15:43,768
for my whole life.

187
00:15:48,908 --> 00:15:50,875
Have you?

188
00:15:50,877 --> 00:15:53,211
I'm working up to it.

189
00:15:54,848 --> 00:15:56,381
Right now I just
want to find out

190
00:15:56,383 --> 00:15:59,083
why her son's wandering around
the woods with a shovel.

191
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:35,019
Look.

192
00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:45,129
What's it say?

193
00:16:51,304 --> 00:16:53,004
It got wet.

194
00:16:53,006 --> 00:16:54,972
It's all gone.

195
00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:57,558
Come on.

196
00:17:00,096 --> 00:17:01,929
It doesn't look that old.

197
00:17:01,931 --> 00:17:04,782
- Yeah?
- I mean, we can't read what they wrote,

198
00:17:04,784 --> 00:17:07,752
but just by doing this,
they're saying something.

199
00:17:07,754 --> 00:17:09,403
What?

200
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:11,722
"We're not alone."

201
00:17:11,724 --> 00:17:14,592
We knew that. We saw it.

202
00:17:15,578 --> 00:17:17,428
People died.

203
00:17:21,835 --> 00:17:23,968
Why are we coming out here?

204
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:28,339
'Cause we're kids.

205
00:17:28,341 --> 00:17:30,475
It's what they do.

206
00:17:32,545 --> 00:17:34,428
We're not kids.

207
00:18:25,765 --> 00:18:28,432
This was a special
request from the doctor.

208
00:18:30,937 --> 00:18:34,071
Hey, whatever she wants.

209
00:18:35,608 --> 00:18:38,342
She saved Carl's life.

210
00:18:38,344 --> 00:18:40,578
We didn't know her, and she
turned out to be all right.

211
00:18:43,116 --> 00:18:44,682
If there's still
people out here,

212
00:18:44,684 --> 00:18:46,918
and they're still people,

213
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,587
we should bring 'em in.

214
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:51,122
What, like this guy?

215
00:18:51,124 --> 00:18:53,624
No, not this guy.

216
00:18:59,832 --> 00:19:01,866
We still got a trail.

217
00:19:04,304 --> 00:19:06,204
Let's go.

218
00:19:34,937 --> 00:19:36,303
Come on.

219
00:19:55,324 --> 00:19:57,408
It was just Michonne
and Spencer.

220
00:20:02,348 --> 00:20:05,316
What were they doing?

221
00:20:05,318 --> 00:20:07,585
Walking. I don't know.

222
00:20:18,431 --> 00:20:21,132
I don't want to
come out here anymore.

223
00:20:35,948 --> 00:20:38,282
Okay.

224
00:21:08,948 --> 00:21:10,281
Carl.

225
00:21:10,283 --> 00:21:12,783
Michonne's out here.
I'm not leaving it.

226
00:21:29,135 --> 00:21:30,801
No.

227
00:21:30,803 --> 00:21:33,053
Hey, come on.

228
00:21:33,055 --> 00:21:34,672
What are you doing?

229
00:21:34,674 --> 00:21:36,207
Come on.

230
00:21:36,209 --> 00:21:39,109
- What are you doing?
- Just go.

231
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:45,182
We should kill it.

232
00:21:45,184 --> 00:21:46,600
- Go home.
- No.

233
00:21:46,602 --> 00:21:48,102
- Enid.
- This is bullshit.

234
00:21:48,104 --> 00:21:49,887
It should be dead.

235
00:21:51,023 --> 00:21:52,890
- Let go.
- Just leave.

236
00:21:57,797 --> 00:22:00,297
You're not killing it.

237
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,968
What the hell is wrong with you?

238
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,570
You wouldn't understand.

239
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,044
You don't want to be out here.
You said it.

240
00:22:14,046 --> 00:22:16,130
So go home.

241
00:23:18,344 --> 00:23:21,111
Hold still and maybe
we won't hurt you.

242
00:23:21,113 --> 00:23:22,446
Sure thing.

243
00:23:22,448 --> 00:23:24,281
Ah!

244
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,626
This is done.

245
00:23:41,384 --> 00:23:43,167
Do you even have any ammo?

246
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:50,240
Okay.

247
00:23:51,694 --> 00:23:53,310
You gonna shoot me over a truck?

248
00:23:53,312 --> 00:23:55,779
There's a lot of food
on that truck.

249
00:23:55,781 --> 00:23:57,698
The keys, now.

250
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,483
I think you know
I'm not a bad guy.

251
00:23:59,485 --> 00:24:01,535
Yeah?

252
00:24:01,537 --> 00:24:03,987
What do you know about us?

253
00:24:03,989 --> 00:24:05,856
Give me the keys.

254
00:24:07,626 --> 00:24:10,194
This is the last time
I'm asking.

255
00:24:17,937 --> 00:24:19,770
Damn it.

256
00:24:21,574 --> 00:24:23,424
You're gonna leave
me here like this?

257
00:24:23,426 --> 00:24:24,842
You're really gonna do that?

258
00:24:24,844 --> 00:24:28,112
Eh, the knots aren't that tight.

259
00:24:28,114 --> 00:24:30,748
You should be able
to get free...

260
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,516
after we're long gone.

261
00:24:35,688 --> 00:24:37,237
Maybe we should talk now.

262
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:38,605
Nah.

263
00:24:38,607 --> 00:24:40,023
Here.

264
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:43,360
In case you get thirsty.

265
00:25:09,088 --> 00:25:11,488
So long, you prick!

266
00:25:28,805 --> 00:25:30,721
Still worked out.

267
00:25:31,858 --> 00:25:33,858
Today still is the day.

268
00:25:42,151 --> 00:25:44,668
Hey, look at that.

269
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:48,172
Yeah, a barn.

270
00:25:52,879 --> 00:25:54,245
You hear that?

271
00:25:58,418 --> 00:26:00,584
I think that son of a
bitch is on the roof.

272
00:26:00,586 --> 00:26:02,520
Hold on.

273
00:26:18,938 --> 00:26:22,139
- Mother...
- Daryl! Daryl!

274
00:27:01,814 --> 00:27:03,981
We came to a conclusion,
asshole!

275
00:27:03,983 --> 00:27:05,149
I got him!

276
00:27:13,993 --> 00:27:15,993
Come here, you little shit!

277
00:27:27,073 --> 00:27:28,272
Duck.

278
00:27:31,878 --> 00:27:33,377
Thanks.

279
00:27:33,379 --> 00:27:35,279
That's my gun!

280
00:27:35,281 --> 00:27:36,897
Come here!

281
00:27:41,387 --> 00:27:42,920
Uh, whoa!

282
00:28:22,895 --> 00:28:24,762
You all right?

283
00:28:24,764 --> 00:28:26,730
Yeah.

284
00:28:26,732 --> 00:28:28,666
Law of averages.

285
00:28:28,668 --> 00:28:31,769
That's bullshit, man.

286
00:28:31,771 --> 00:28:33,988
Let's go check them cars,
get the hell out of here.

287
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,906
What about the guy?

288
00:28:35,908 --> 00:28:37,374
What about him?

289
00:28:37,376 --> 00:28:38,909
Well, he helped you.

290
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,279
Maybe.

291
00:28:45,518 --> 00:28:47,618
He ever pull a weapon on you?

292
00:28:51,224 --> 00:28:52,973
Fine.

293
00:28:52,975 --> 00:28:55,142
Let's put him up a tree.

294
00:29:04,303 --> 00:29:06,870
Why are you still here?

295
00:29:06,872 --> 00:29:10,107
I liked your mom a lot.

296
00:29:10,109 --> 00:29:12,409
I really don't want you to die.

297
00:29:14,113 --> 00:29:15,913
So, come on.

298
00:29:15,915 --> 00:29:17,681
- Let's go home.
- My family's dead. That's not home.

299
00:29:17,683 --> 00:29:19,516
It's just where I live.

300
00:29:19,518 --> 00:29:21,085
It's more than that.

301
00:29:21,087 --> 00:29:23,153
Hey, enough.

302
00:29:23,155 --> 00:29:24,755
I'm fine.

303
00:29:27,126 --> 00:29:30,127
You've got a life back there,
and maybe I will, too,

304
00:29:30,129 --> 00:29:34,965
but before I can even think about that,
I need to take care of something.

305
00:29:41,841 --> 00:29:43,507
I have to try.

306
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:45,042
So let me help you.

307
00:29:50,449 --> 00:29:52,199
You can't.

308
00:30:03,162 --> 00:30:04,878
Carl?

309
00:30:23,149 --> 00:30:25,482
I thought I saw her that night.

310
00:30:25,484 --> 00:30:27,901
I thought I did.

311
00:30:29,855 --> 00:30:31,605
I did.

312
00:31:15,634 --> 00:31:18,168
I got her. I got her.

313
00:31:35,755 --> 00:31:38,255
So that's why I was out here.

314
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,313
She left me a note.

315
00:32:11,866 --> 00:32:15,916
She said I still knew my way.

316
00:32:17,654 --> 00:32:20,721
I never knew my way.

317
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:24,392
You loved your family?

318
00:32:24,394 --> 00:32:25,978
Yeah.

319
00:32:26,105 --> 00:32:28,004
Then you know your way.

320
00:32:28,006 --> 00:32:30,107
It's home.

321
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,910
They're gone.

322
00:32:36,215 --> 00:32:39,166
I've been out here chasing
you all over the woods.

323
00:32:41,837 --> 00:32:44,821
You've still got family,

324
00:32:44,823 --> 00:32:46,723
and you've still got a home.

325
00:32:55,734 --> 00:32:58,101
Let's go.

326
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:28,548
He took a pretty hard hit.

327
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,734
Denise needs to look him over.

328
00:33:30,736 --> 00:33:32,552
Yeah.

329
00:33:32,554 --> 00:33:33,937
You wouldn't have
gone through with it.

330
00:33:33,939 --> 00:33:35,172
You wouldn't have left him.

331
00:33:35,174 --> 00:33:37,641
I would've, right up in a tree.

332
00:33:37,643 --> 00:33:41,444
- I would've.
- No. I know.

333
00:33:41,446 --> 00:33:44,014
Almost as soon as we got
to Alexandria, you got it.

334
00:33:44,016 --> 00:33:46,483
You saw... you...

335
00:33:46,485 --> 00:33:49,536
and Michonne, Glenn,
you all tried to tell me.

336
00:33:50,656 --> 00:33:53,406
So shut up.

337
00:33:55,827 --> 00:33:58,495
'Cause I'm finally listening.

338
00:34:05,971 --> 00:34:08,038
See that bright one?

339
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,840
Yeah, that's the North Star.

340
00:34:11,927 --> 00:34:14,511
It's at the end
of the Little Dipper.

341
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:17,147
Yeah.

342
00:34:19,651 --> 00:34:22,519
If you get lost at night,
just find that star.

343
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,356
Hey.

344
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:28,074
Hey.

345
00:34:30,245 --> 00:34:31,461
You have a good day?

346
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,082
I guess so.

347
00:34:37,452 --> 00:34:38,835
I'm gonna take her in.

348
00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:41,755
Carl.

349
00:34:50,465 --> 00:34:52,048
I saw what you did.

350
00:34:53,635 --> 00:34:55,468
With Deanna.

351
00:35:00,442 --> 00:35:02,976
Yeah?

352
00:35:02,978 --> 00:35:06,613
You should've left her
or killed her.

353
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,954
No, that's stupid.

354
00:35:13,956 --> 00:35:16,906
What's stupid is you being out
there when you don't have to.

355
00:35:16,908 --> 00:35:18,541
You did the same thing.
You didn't...

356
00:35:18,543 --> 00:35:20,493
you and Spencer didn't have
to go out there, but you did.

357
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:23,046
- That's different.
- It's not.

358
00:35:23,048 --> 00:35:25,298
I wasn't gonna leave her
out there like that.

359
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,750
You wouldn't.

360
00:35:26,752 --> 00:35:29,552
You wouldn't. I know it.

361
00:35:29,554 --> 00:35:31,254
I couldn't kill her.

362
00:35:31,256 --> 00:35:33,840
- Why not?
- Because... be...

363
00:35:35,427 --> 00:35:36,593
You could've killed her.

364
00:35:36,595 --> 00:35:38,261
No, I couldn't. I wouldn't.

365
00:35:38,263 --> 00:35:39,396
Were you playing some
sort of game out there?

366
00:35:39,398 --> 00:35:40,930
- Did you think that...
- No!

367
00:35:40,932 --> 00:35:42,098
Then why?

368
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,433
Because it should be
someone who loved her,

369
00:35:43,435 --> 00:35:45,969
someone who's family,
and I... I'd do it for you.

370
00:35:53,078 --> 00:35:54,694
I would.

371
00:35:58,917 --> 00:36:00,500
Come here.

372
00:36:06,174 --> 00:36:07,590
Me, too.

373
00:36:39,624 --> 00:36:41,825
You know, I was thinking...

374
00:36:41,827 --> 00:36:43,710
back before we went
out to the quarry.

375
00:36:44,963 --> 00:36:47,797
The morning after Reg and Pete.

376
00:36:47,799 --> 00:36:51,418
You said we shouldn't be
looking for people no more.

377
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,086
You were right.

378
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:56,506
No...

379
00:36:56,508 --> 00:36:58,174
I was wrong.

380
00:36:58,176 --> 00:36:59,676
You were right.

381
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,340
- Sorry to wake you up.
- Who is this?

382
00:37:30,342 --> 00:37:31,841
Come on, man, he's heavy.

383
00:37:31,843 --> 00:37:34,210
Oh, that thing,
uh, didn't work out.

384
00:37:34,212 --> 00:37:35,762
It's this asshole's fault.
Sorry.

385
00:37:35,764 --> 00:37:37,097
Lay him on the bed.

386
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:38,264
All right, take a look at him.

387
00:37:38,266 --> 00:37:40,183
He ain't staying, though.

388
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:03,323
We'll see.

389
00:38:05,911 --> 00:38:09,078
It is pretty stupid of us
to go out there, isn't it?

390
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,914
Yep.

391
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:13,133
- Do it again tomorrow?
- Yep.

392
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:36,156
Move.

393
00:38:36,158 --> 00:38:37,824
Hey.

394
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:47,884
She's practicing in her sleep.

395
00:38:50,288 --> 00:38:52,088
Yeah.

396
00:38:54,926 --> 00:38:57,126
It's good to be home.

397
00:38:57,128 --> 00:38:59,879
Yeah, you're telling me.

398
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:03,716
Where's Daryl?

399
00:39:03,718 --> 00:39:05,768
Watching over a guy

400
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:08,304
till some other guy
can take over.

401
00:39:08,306 --> 00:39:10,557
You found a guy?

402
00:39:13,528 --> 00:39:16,529
Crazy day.

403
00:39:16,531 --> 00:39:19,115
You wanna talk about it?

404
00:39:19,117 --> 00:39:21,734
No, not right now.

405
00:39:21,736 --> 00:39:24,320
I just want to turn my
brain off for a minute.

406
00:39:27,893 --> 00:39:30,243
You wanna tell me
about your day?

407
00:39:30,245 --> 00:39:33,129
No.

408
00:39:33,131 --> 00:39:34,747
Same thing.

409
00:39:34,749 --> 00:39:36,633
What, you found a guy?

410
00:39:36,635 --> 00:39:39,168
Not a guy.

411
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:49,562
Oh...

412
00:39:55,153 --> 00:39:57,353
got you something.

413
00:40:04,362 --> 00:40:05,912
Is this instead
of the toothpaste?

414
00:40:05,914 --> 00:40:07,530
Mm-hmm.

415
00:40:07,532 --> 00:40:10,867
Well, I do have a crate
of toothpaste for you.

416
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:14,337
It's currently
at the bottom of a lake.

417
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:16,139
Oh, so you had a day.

418
00:40:16,141 --> 00:40:19,542
Yeah...

419
00:40:19,544 --> 00:40:22,712
all on account
of your dental hygiene.

420
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:25,098
Have your mints.

421
00:41:05,223 --> 00:41:06,723
Wait... wait a minute.

422
00:41:20,322 --> 00:41:21,988
Okay.

423
00:41:46,101 --> 00:41:57,408

00:41:57,942 --> 00:41:59,976
Rick.

425
00:41:59,978 --> 00:42:02,111
Rick, wake up.

426
00:42:05,984 --> 00:42:08,708
We should talk.
