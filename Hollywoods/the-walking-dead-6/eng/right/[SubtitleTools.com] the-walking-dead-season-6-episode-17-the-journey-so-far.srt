Can you maintain some semblance
of society as we know it?

How do you keep hope alive?

9
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:35,390
It's a struggle for humanity.

Who do you become?

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,728
And what choices do you make?

12
00:00:39,753 --> 00:00:41,401
Every choice has a consequence.

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,726
The Walking Dead is about
finding out who you are

14
00:00:44,805 --> 00:00:46,285
and what you're willing to fight for.

15
00:00:47,734 --> 00:00:50,104
If you look at any of the
characters on the show,

they're so completely different
than when they first showed up.

17
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:57,715
And they're changed by this

The Walking Dead is based on
a very popular graphic novel

21
00:01:08,477 --> 00:01:10,043
written by Robert Kirkman.

22
00:01:10,078 --> 00:01:13,346
The idea behind the comic book
came from my love of zombie films.

23
00:01:13,382 --> 00:01:15,148
But they all kind of end the same way.

24
00:01:15,184 --> 00:01:17,784
Either everyone dies or they all
kind of climb into a helicopter

25
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,821

Shane, is his partner.

And just after you're
introduced to these characters,

42
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,569
there's an armed robbery,

43
00:02:08,602 --> 00:02:10,070

he's unaware of what's been going on...

47

That was one of the things that drew me

to playing Rick is that he's
not the man with no name.

You know, he's not that archetype.

He's a family man. He's
a husband and a father

66

Laurie?

him to this place is not there.

for? What kind of wound?

He's a regular guy who had a regular job

the father to his son, Dwayne

Friend, you need
glasses. It was a walker.

00:04:13,473 --> 00:04:15,640
Walkers is the term Morgan uses

00:04:15,676 --> 00:04:17,876
and, therefore, the one
that he passes on to Rick.

00:04:17,911 --> 00:04:19,878
Hey, listen. Do you even
know what's going on?

Morgan tells him that the
dead have come back to life.

The most important rule
Rick learns from Morgan

89
00:04:25,285 --> 00:04:26,585
is don't get bit.

90
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,621
You get bit, you're go into
a fever and then you die.

And as if that wasn't enough,

92
00:04:31,525 --> 00:04:34,826
then you come back as a hungry walker

93
00:04:34,861 --> 00:04:37,762
and to end the walker, you
have to penetrate the brain.

00:04:44,571 --> 00:04:46,171
Morgan's wife has been bit.

98
00:04:46,206 --> 00:04:49,294
Kind of failed at the
first hurdle, really.

00:04:49,468 --> 00:04:52,071
I should have put her down,

I just didn't have it in me.

00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:55,531
This was a person. This was a life.

102
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:58,033
This was somebody who
was loved and cared for.

103
00:04:58,068 --> 00:05:01,503
And now she's just this
sad pathetic creature.

104
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:05,140
And that, I think, beautifully
illustrates what our world is about.

105
00:05:05,175 --> 00:05:07,809
It's not just fear and blood and gore.

106
00:05:07,845 --> 00:05:09,778
It's really, really sad.

00:05:11,975 --> 00:05:14,482
I'll turn mine on a few
minutes every day at dawn.

You get up there,
that's how you find me.

109
00:05:16,954 --> 00:05:20,722
So the next step for Rick is to
reclaim his badge and his boots

110
00:05:20,758 --> 00:05:24,693
and get his hat, and go back into
Atlanta to find out what's going on.

111
00:05:25,536 --> 00:05:28,167
The sheriff rides into town...

112
00:05:30,825 --> 00:05:34,636

00:05:43,013 --> 00:05:46,059
He doesn't know what to do.
He's trapped inside this tank...

115
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:47,635
and then the radio goes off.

116
00:05:47,675 --> 00:05:49,708
Hey, dumb ass. Yeah, you in the tank.

117
00:05:49,743 --> 00:05:50,976
Cozy in there?

00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:52,411
Hey, dumb ass.

I mean, it's just awesome.

120
00:05:53,955 --> 00:05:57,255
And he realizes that there
is another person out there

121
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,152
that is friendly, and wants to help.

122
00:06:00,187 --> 00:06:01,453
Got any advice for me?

123
00:06:01,488 --> 00:06:03,889
I'd say make a run for it.

124
00:06:07,693 --> 00:06:10,505
Whoa! Not dead! Come on, come on!

125
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,201
Glenn used to be a pizza delivery boy.

00:06:16,236 --> 00:06:19,871
He knows his way around,
especially Atlanta.

127
00:06:19,907 --> 00:06:21,106
And he's resourceful.

You just rang the dinner bell.

Our walkers in The Walking
Dead are flesh-eaters.

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,328
So they're drawn to people.
They're drawn by sounds and smell.

136
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:47,966
They've figured out that the dead are
attracted to the smell of the living.

Think about something
else. Puppies and kittens.

141
00:07:00,547 --> 00:07:03,982
One of the most enjoyable scenes
I've had the good fortune of filming,

142
00:07:04,294 --> 00:07:07,380
16 hours of smearing myself in blood.

143
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,301
We're walking down the street,
and we'regetting away with it.

144
00:07:11,325 --> 00:07:12,394
It's working.

145
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:14,059
You know, they're not gonna bite us.

146
00:07:14,094 --> 00:07:16,228
And then, of course, the thunder strikes

147
00:07:16,263 --> 00:07:18,530
and the rain starts, and
it starts dripping off.

148
00:07:18,565 --> 00:07:20,124
Run!

149
00:07:21,394 --> 00:07:24,035
That was my welcome
to a Hollywood moment.

150
00:07:24,071 --> 00:07:29,007
Shut down downtown Atlanta.
200 extras all in zombie gear.

151
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:31,576
And that was... can we curse on this?

152
00:07:31,612 --> 00:07:33,979
[bleep] bad ass.

153
00:07:37,117 --> 00:07:40,575
We get away and then we make it to camp

154
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:44,924
which, by the good grace of
God, has my best friend, Shane

155
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,384
and my wife and child.

156
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:52,888
The moment that Carl sees
his dad again is huge.

157
00:07:52,923 --> 00:07:56,024
The past month, he's been
told that his dad was dead.

158
00:07:56,723 --> 00:07:58,060
Oh!

159
00:07:58,095 --> 00:08:02,297
And just to see him standing there
like that was really, really like...

160
00:08:04,368 --> 00:08:06,868
You see as an audience
the shock for Laurie

161
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,437
and Shane, in particular.

162
00:08:08,472 --> 00:08:10,016
Because at this point,
the audience knows

163
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,940
that Laurie and Shane
have had a relationship

164
00:08:11,984 --> 00:08:14,386
since Rick has supposedly passed away.

165
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:16,653
When Shane sees Rick, it's
kind of bittersweet for him

166
00:08:16,688 --> 00:08:18,922
because he's happy to see Rick alive

167
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,424
but Shane and Laurie
have gotten together.

168
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:25,295
He's also worried that the whole
thing was not gonna end well.

169
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,130
Come meet everybody.

170
00:08:27,165 --> 00:08:30,834
The whole community is a
ragtag group of survivors.

171
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:33,870
We have Dale, we have T-Dog

172
00:08:33,905 --> 00:08:35,530
and Andrea's sister, Amy.

173
00:08:35,555 --> 00:08:36,943
Oh, my God!

174
00:08:36,968 --> 00:08:39,609
You scared the shit out of me!

175
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,312
Amy is the love of Andrea's life.

176
00:08:42,347 --> 00:08:44,414
It's her baby sister. It's her heart.

177
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:46,367
And, of course, Carol.

178
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:49,285
- You washed my clothes?
- Well, best we could.

179
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,588
That's very kind. Thank you.

180
00:08:51,623 --> 00:08:53,435
When we first meet Carol,

181
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,958
she is mother of Sophia, wife of Ed.

182
00:08:56,983 --> 00:08:59,542
Sophia is the light of her life.

183
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:01,818
Ed is an A-hole.

184
00:09:01,853 --> 00:09:03,620
Come on. Let's go.

185
00:09:03,655 --> 00:09:05,388
She is an abused housewife.

186
00:09:05,423 --> 00:09:07,648
You don't tell me what? I tell you what!

187
00:09:08,442 --> 00:09:10,460
And we meet Daryl Dixon.

188
00:09:10,495 --> 00:09:12,410
You don't want to piss this guy off.

189
00:09:12,942 --> 00:09:15,932
- Daryl's a country boy.
- Son of a bitch!

190
00:09:15,967 --> 00:09:17,612
First time he meets them, he
just thinks they're all idiots,

191
00:09:17,636 --> 00:09:19,517
because they don't know
how to kill a zombie.

192
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:23,231
That crossbow is like,
yeah, it's his thing.

193
00:09:23,548 --> 00:09:26,009
It's gotta be the brain.
Don't y'all know nothin'?

194
00:09:26,044 --> 00:09:28,673
His first meeting with
Rick does not go well

195
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:31,500
when he learns that his brother
has been left behind in the city.

196
00:09:31,525 --> 00:09:34,595
My first introduction to the show was
turning around and facing that group

197
00:09:34,619 --> 00:09:37,787
and just being a
complete hothead lunatic.

198
00:09:37,822 --> 00:09:39,166
You got something you wanna tell me?

199
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,601
Your brother was a danger to us all,

200
00:09:41,927 --> 00:09:44,661
so I handcuffed him on a roof,
hooked into a piece of metal.

201
00:09:44,847 --> 00:09:47,259
Merle is Daryl's redneck brother.

202
00:09:47,284 --> 00:09:49,693
He was one of the scavengers in Atlanta.

203
00:09:49,718 --> 00:09:52,702
Just tell me where he
is so's I can go get him!

204
00:09:52,737 --> 00:09:54,137
I'm going back.

205
00:09:54,172 --> 00:09:56,439
Shane is vehemently
opposed to this idea.

206
00:09:56,474 --> 00:09:58,975
He doesn't think that
Merle is worth saving

207
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,309
and he's not worth the risk.

208
00:10:00,345 --> 00:10:01,911
I mean, it's a dangerous move.

209
00:10:01,946 --> 00:10:03,780
And Merle's not really an asset.

210
00:10:03,815 --> 00:10:07,984
He's a liability, but
Rick is still the good guy.

211
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:09,886
I mean, he's the heart of our story.

212
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,221
Merle!

213
00:10:12,257 --> 00:10:14,957
No! No!

214
00:10:14,993 --> 00:10:17,126
But he's not there anymore, you know.

215
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:21,169
His hand was there. That's about it.

216
00:10:23,835 --> 00:10:25,635
- Where you going?
- I have to pee.

217
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:28,907
So while Rick is gone...

218
00:10:30,241 --> 00:10:33,676
we have this invasion of
walkers coming in from the woods.

219
00:10:33,712 --> 00:10:36,245
[screams]

220
00:10:36,281 --> 00:10:38,981
The camp is defenseless,
and there's a huge massacre.

221
00:10:39,017 --> 00:10:42,682
Many people die, in
particular, Carol's husband, Ed.

222
00:10:43,031 --> 00:10:44,680
I'm not really crying over that one.

223
00:10:44,705 --> 00:10:47,167
And Andrea's sister, Amy

224
00:10:47,785 --> 00:10:52,477
which was just the worst thing
that ever happened to Andrea.

225
00:10:56,067 --> 00:10:58,828
For the first time, we
see someone being bit

226
00:10:58,853 --> 00:11:01,344
that turns into a flesh-eating creature.

227
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,534
It wasn't a monster movie moment.

228
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:05,625
It's very gentle.

229
00:11:05,668 --> 00:11:07,837
It was the sense of loss.

230
00:11:07,862 --> 00:11:09,457
- I love you.
- [growls]

231
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:13,142
And Andrea had to put her down.

232
00:11:13,177 --> 00:11:14,932
It was the compassionate thing to do.

233
00:11:14,957 --> 00:11:16,659
It was a mercy killing.

234
00:11:18,402 --> 00:11:20,683
I heard the CDC was working on a cure.

235
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,926
You know, he's throwing a Hail Mary.

236
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:24,987
But he just says, look, the only hope

237
00:11:25,022 --> 00:11:27,590
is let's see if we can get to the CDC,

238
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:31,060
find out anything
about what is happening.

239
00:11:32,911 --> 00:11:34,212
Why are you here? What do you want?

240
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:35,498
A chance.

241
00:11:35,816 --> 00:11:37,867
That's asking an awful lot these days.

242
00:11:38,183 --> 00:11:39,627
They get there and they discover that,

243
00:11:39,651 --> 00:11:41,284
you know, the world's gone.

244
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:43,720
There is no CDC. There's
just one dude there.

245
00:11:43,755 --> 00:11:46,790
It invades the brain like meningitis.

246
00:11:46,825 --> 00:11:50,026
Dr. Jenner, he says,
the dead return to life,

247
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,629
and they want to feed.

248
00:11:52,664 --> 00:11:56,499
The frontal lobes, the human part,
that doesn't come back. The you part.

249
00:11:56,535 --> 00:11:58,968
At this point, there's no hope anymore.

250
00:11:59,614 --> 00:12:01,954
"30 minutes to decontamination."

251
00:12:01,979 --> 00:12:05,089
He's initiated this fail-safe system.

252
00:12:05,114 --> 00:12:07,310
You know, there's a lot of
really dangerous diseases

253
00:12:07,345 --> 00:12:09,112
that they'd studied at the CDC,

254
00:12:09,147 --> 00:12:12,248
and so if that facility were
to fail, it will self-destruct.

255
00:12:12,284 --> 00:12:14,317
- Come on!
- Come on, let's go!

256
00:12:14,352 --> 00:12:15,718
- Run!
- Stay right by me!

257
00:12:15,754 --> 00:12:17,587
Before the fail-safe kicked in,

258
00:12:17,622 --> 00:12:19,622
Dr. Jenner whispered
something in Rick's ear.

259
00:12:19,658 --> 00:12:21,925
The secret that no one else knows.

260
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,993
We got four minutes left! Come on!

261
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:28,465
Season One finishes in a time-honored
fashion with a huge explosion.

262
00:12:33,205 --> 00:12:35,605
It is a pretty bleak finale.

263
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,007
Everything blows up. There is no hope.

264
00:12:38,043 --> 00:12:40,543
And we're on the road to nowhere.

265
00:12:49,551 --> 00:12:51,558
♪ ♪

266
00:12:54,234 --> 00:12:56,464
The CDC was a dead end.

267
00:12:57,686 --> 00:12:58,952
I met a man there.

268
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:02,455
He told me something.

269
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,458
It doesn't matter.

270
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,660
What matters is we're moving on.

271
00:13:08,797 --> 00:13:10,764
At the beginning of Season Two,

272
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:13,566
we join our group still on the run.

273
00:13:13,602 --> 00:13:15,602
They have no clear destination.

274
00:13:15,637 --> 00:13:17,233
They don't know where they're gonna go.

275
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,307
Out there looking for safety.

276
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:24,644
We stop, we see hundreds of cars empty.

277
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,814
We're just looking for rations
and anything that we can use.

278
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:31,117
And then all of a sudden,
this herd shows up.

279
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:36,068
Oh, Christ!

280
00:13:36,558 --> 00:13:39,793
Like animals, they are
starting to migrate.

281
00:13:39,828 --> 00:13:42,128
The opening in Season
Two really allowed us

282
00:13:42,164 --> 00:13:44,764
to start illustrating
the herd mentality.

283
00:13:46,168 --> 00:13:50,870
The birth of the herd shows more
and more walkers joined together.

284
00:13:50,906 --> 00:13:53,206
It turns into this immovable force.

285
00:13:53,241 --> 00:13:56,276
If you wind up in the middle of one,
you're in a great deal of trouble

286
00:13:56,311 --> 00:13:58,378
and our group winds up
in the middle of one.

287
00:13:58,413 --> 00:13:59,454
[screams]

288
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:02,615
So the herd makes Carol's daughter run.

289
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:06,192
That's when Sophia goes missing.

290
00:14:09,658 --> 00:14:10,768
Why aren't we all out there looking?

291
00:14:10,792 --> 00:14:12,459
Why are we moving cars?

292
00:14:12,494 --> 00:14:14,694
We're not going anywhere
till my daughter gets back.

293
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,596
Sophia gets separated from the group,

294
00:14:16,631 --> 00:14:18,631
and Daryl takes it
upon himself to go look.

295
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:21,835
I'm gonna walk the
road. Look for the girl.

296
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:25,908
The ideas of what is right and wrong are
constantly changing and breaking down.

297
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:29,142
And it becomes a big point of contention
particularly between Rick and Shane.

298
00:14:29,177 --> 00:14:33,494
Shane believes that every moment that
we spend looking for the little girl,

299
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,015
it could possibly endanger our safety.

300
00:14:36,051 --> 00:14:39,052
It's a tough question
about when to give up.

301
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,191
During the search, they see a deer.

302
00:14:45,775 --> 00:14:49,187
And then this beautiful moment
is shattered by a gunshot.

303
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:53,933
The moment that he got shot in the woods

304
00:14:53,969 --> 00:14:55,702
was a really big turning point.

305
00:14:55,737 --> 00:14:58,104
Talk to Hershel, he'll help your boy!

306
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,524
Otis, who shot Carl by mistake,

307
00:15:00,549 --> 00:15:03,645
tells us that there's a farmstead.
There's a guy called Hershel.

308
00:15:04,074 --> 00:15:06,446
Hershel is living on a farm

309
00:15:06,481 --> 00:15:08,915
that has been in his
family for generations.

310
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,718
And he is a veterinarian
as well as a farmer.

311
00:15:11,753 --> 00:15:14,655
- Help me! Help my boy!
- Get him inside! Go inside!

312
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,257
You need to give us some room.

313
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:22,028
And Rick is a control freak. But this is
an opportunity for him to have to wait.

314
00:15:22,425 --> 00:15:24,164
I have to put him under.

315
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:26,332
He won't be able to breathe on his own.

316
00:15:26,368 --> 00:15:27,800
You need a respirator.

317
00:15:27,836 --> 00:15:31,805
Otis leads Shane to
what was a refugee camp.

318
00:15:34,109 --> 00:15:36,009
Endotracheal intubater, baby.

319
00:15:36,306 --> 00:15:38,706
They're being followed by walkers.

320
00:15:40,212 --> 00:15:41,633
Otis is slow.

321
00:15:41,658 --> 00:15:44,295
There is a risk that, if Shane
stays with him, they both die.

322
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:47,954
And if they both die, this
equipment does not get back to Carl.

323
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,289
Shane makes a decision.

324
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:50,651
- [gunshot]
- [screaming]

325
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:53,626
He shoots Otis in the
leg to leave him as bait.

326
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:55,161
[screaming]

327
00:15:55,197 --> 00:15:59,666
He will do horrifying things in the
name of protecting the people he loves.

328
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,470
He seems to have stabilized.

329
00:16:06,408 --> 00:16:10,043
When the group reaches the farm,
it really is a temporary safe haven,

330
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:12,205
and we can finally breathe.

331
00:16:12,316 --> 00:16:14,080
They aren't getting
much walker activity.

332
00:16:14,115 --> 00:16:15,982
It's a bit isolated.

333
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:19,085
Just hoping we can ride it out
in peace till there's a cure.

334
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,520
Hershel's an optimist.

335
00:16:20,555 --> 00:16:22,455
He does believe that
there could be a cure

336
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:26,025
and, therefore, there's a
value even to the walkers.

337
00:16:26,412 --> 00:16:30,717
Hershel has two beautiful young
daughters, Maggie and Beth.

338
00:16:30,742 --> 00:16:32,999
They are very close.

339
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:36,869
They've worked and raised that
farm and the livestock together.

340
00:16:36,905 --> 00:16:41,337
I think there's a friendship
almost equal to their sisterhood.

341
00:16:41,362 --> 00:16:43,387
Maggie, she's at an age where
she doesn't have to listen

342
00:16:43,411 --> 00:16:46,179
to everything that
her dad, Hershel, says.

343
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:48,125
And she's finding herself,
and that still needs to happen

344
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:49,549
even when it's an apocalypse.

345
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:51,443
Nice to see you again.

346
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,632
When Maggie first meets Glenn,

347
00:16:54,665 --> 00:16:57,457
she sees he's so brave
that it almost seems stupid.

348
00:16:58,521 --> 00:16:59,792
Doing okay?

349
00:16:59,828 --> 00:17:01,561
Yeah, doing great.

350
00:17:03,498 --> 00:17:05,298
Living the dream.

351
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,967
But ultimately, undeniably attractive.

352
00:17:08,003 --> 00:17:10,358
Hello, farmer's daughter.

353
00:17:10,383 --> 00:17:13,973
Glenn treads carefully in a way
where he wants to be respectful.

354
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:17,545
I hear you're fast on your feet
and know how to get in and out.

355
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:19,646
When Maggie and Glenn
go off on this run,

356
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,225
and they're in the pharmacy,
I think it's the time

357
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,650
to really road-test
this possible attraction.

358
00:17:23,685 --> 00:17:26,213
Which Maggie wastes
no time doing. [laughs]

359
00:17:26,238 --> 00:17:28,833
Condoms? You got a
girlfriend I don't know about?

360
00:17:28,857 --> 00:17:30,650
Me? No.

361
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,258
Then you're a pretty confident guy.

362
00:17:32,294 --> 00:17:36,758
I think in that moment, she just
wants to feel a connection with anyone.

363
00:17:37,755 --> 00:17:41,834
It's every part of him saying
like, danger, danger, danger.

364
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:45,371
And then like one part of him
saying like, this is awesome.

365
00:17:47,657 --> 00:17:50,696
Once you find this girl and
your boy's fit for travel,

366
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,831
I expect you'll move on.

367
00:17:52,856 --> 00:17:57,327
Hershel is not so happy about
this group of people joining.

368
00:17:58,071 --> 00:18:01,220
But what the world is out
there isn't what you saw on TV.

369
00:18:01,256 --> 00:18:04,324
It is much, much worse,
and it changes you.

370
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:07,460
Rick is pleading with
Hershel to let them stay.

371
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:09,562
How are they my responsibility?

372
00:18:09,597 --> 00:18:12,765
Rick has a few reasons why
he wants to stay on the farm.

373
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:14,384
There's food, there's livestock.

374
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:18,789
But more importantly, his son is
very, very sick and needs to rest.

375
00:18:18,923 --> 00:18:22,551
And then he gets delivered
the double whammy.

376
00:18:23,194 --> 00:18:25,128
My wife's pregnant.

377
00:18:25,163 --> 00:18:28,765
That's either a gift here or
a death sentence out there.

378
00:18:31,336 --> 00:18:36,205
At the same time, Glenn and Maggie
are forming a nice little relationship.

379
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:45,214
Glenn's making a bee line to
the barn with some blankets.

380
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,849
And a box of condoms.

381
00:18:46,885 --> 00:18:51,354
He's going to meet
Maggie to fool around.

382
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:56,272
Instead, he comes upon a
barn filled with walkers.

383
00:18:57,425 --> 00:18:59,169
You weren't supposed to see this.

384
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:03,833
Hershel's wife is in there,
his friends, his neighbors.

385
00:19:03,868 --> 00:19:06,169
He's hoping that there will
be a cure for these people

386
00:19:06,204 --> 00:19:08,071
that he cares a great deal about.

387
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,872
We don't shoot sick people.

388
00:19:09,908 --> 00:19:11,917
They're not people.

389
00:19:13,146 --> 00:19:14,877
Shane doesn't care
about Hershel's feelings.

390
00:19:14,913 --> 00:19:18,014
He's coming from a place
of protecting the group.

391
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:22,460
So Shane takes it upon
himself to open up the barn

392
00:19:22,487 --> 00:19:24,587
and kill everyone that's inside it.

393
00:19:24,612 --> 00:19:26,045
[gunfire]

394
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,195
It's a crushing experience.

395
00:19:34,532 --> 00:19:38,059
The last to come out is Sophia.

396
00:19:39,107 --> 00:19:40,924
Sophia!

397
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,208
And Carol thinks from that distance

398
00:19:45,438 --> 00:19:47,443
and from the desire of her heart,

399
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:50,247
she looks like she could be okay.

400
00:19:51,015 --> 00:19:55,184
And the closer she gets,
she realizes she's turned.

401
00:19:56,286 --> 00:19:59,562
I remember when the first half
of the season was pitched to me,

402
00:19:59,605 --> 00:20:03,126
then Sophia comes out of the
barn. I was like... [gasps]

403
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:06,333
To know that she had been under
their noses the entire time

404
00:20:06,358 --> 00:20:08,198
was just absolutely heartbreaking.

405
00:20:08,223 --> 00:20:10,933
Sophia represents the
theme of that season.

406
00:20:11,755 --> 00:20:14,871
That this world is ruthless.
That this world is unforgiving.

407
00:20:14,906 --> 00:20:18,141
That this world doesn't hold
its punches for little girls.

408
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:21,511
It takes everything and
anything that it can.

409
00:20:28,873 --> 00:20:30,586
It's a drag when
anybody goes on the show.

410
00:20:30,622 --> 00:20:32,255
But like she's such a sweet girl.

411
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,023
And it was such a bummer.

412
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:36,125
But for Carol, that
changes her whole thing.

413
00:20:36,161 --> 00:20:38,261
Another huge turning point for Carol.

414
00:20:38,576 --> 00:20:41,941
But a great loss for her and the group.

415
00:20:44,394 --> 00:20:47,236
It was a very trying moment for Hershel.

416
00:20:47,272 --> 00:20:49,405
So he went off on his own to get drunk.

417
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,941
I promised Maggie I'd
bring you home safe.

418
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,778
Like you promised that little girl?

419
00:20:56,701 --> 00:21:00,320
When they get to the bar,
these two gentlemen...

420
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:02,552
I use the term loosely... show up.

421
00:21:02,587 --> 00:21:05,027
Son of a bitch. They're alive.

422
00:21:05,052 --> 00:21:07,382
All of a sudden, you get a sense

423
00:21:07,407 --> 00:21:11,127
that not everybody out there
is looking to be your friend.

424
00:21:11,162 --> 00:21:12,962
We can't stay out there.

425
00:21:12,997 --> 00:21:15,465
The farm is too crowded
as is. I'm sorry.

426
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,633
This world is not just
something you can navigate

427
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:20,867
by getting really good
at killing walkers.

428
00:21:24,642 --> 00:21:26,201
It's no-holds-barred now.

429
00:21:26,226 --> 00:21:27,770
[gunfire]

430
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:32,748
There's a gunfight.

431
00:21:32,784 --> 00:21:35,585
Randall, who was one of the bad guys,

432
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,487
impaled himself on the
fence falling off the roof.

433
00:21:38,523 --> 00:21:40,308
- Don't leave me, please!
- We have to go!

434
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,419
We can't!

435
00:21:41,444 --> 00:21:43,537
- He was just shooting at me!
- He's a kid!

436
00:21:43,561 --> 00:21:45,561
[screams]

437
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:47,072
Rick saves him,

438
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:50,733
thus begins a big argument
between Shane and Rick.

439
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:52,602
What to do with this guy?

440
00:21:52,637 --> 00:21:55,504
Do we take someone's
life to protect our own?

441
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,975
Or do we release them at the risk of him

442
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,177
telling others where we are?

443
00:22:01,212 --> 00:22:06,082
Shane is trying to push that
idea of the old rules don't apply.

444
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:11,354
So the answer is to kill him to prevent
a crime that he may never even attempt?

445
00:22:11,689 --> 00:22:15,124
That episode was pivotal
in launching our show

446
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:20,329
into a different direction of
what humanity is defined by.

447
00:22:27,415 --> 00:22:29,029
Carl finds a gun

448
00:22:29,054 --> 00:22:32,637
and ends up wandering off into a swamp

449
00:22:32,662 --> 00:22:34,929
and finds a walker.

450
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:36,587
And can't bring himself to shoot it.

451
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,783
[screams]

452
00:22:42,213 --> 00:22:44,854
And the walker escapes.

453
00:22:44,889 --> 00:22:47,689
Dale ends up in the field...

454
00:22:49,227 --> 00:22:50,793
[screaming]

455
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:55,865
and the walker shows up and kills him.

456
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,180
This leaves Carl with
a really strong feeling

457
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:08,311
of not wanting to mess
up ever again like that.

458
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:09,695
Sorry brother.

459
00:23:10,716 --> 00:23:13,100
Dale dies and Rick
takes that upon himself

460
00:23:13,151 --> 00:23:15,818
as a sign that we let Randall go.

461
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:19,188
Me and Daryl's gonna take Randall
off-site and cut him loose.

462
00:23:19,223 --> 00:23:22,067
For Shane, this is the tipping point.

463
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:26,085
Releasing Randall shows that
Rick's not fit for leadership.

464
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,731
Shane now thinks that
Rick is the threat.

465
00:23:28,766 --> 00:23:32,101
He needs to kill Rick in
order for the group to be safe.

466
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,455
For me, having written
that story in the comic,

467
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,073
and seeing, you know, Andrew
Lincoln and Jon Bernthal.

468
00:23:37,108 --> 00:23:39,050
The best of friends offset,

469
00:23:39,075 --> 00:23:43,677
onset being at each other's throats in
such a visceral way, it was monumental.

470
00:23:43,702 --> 00:23:46,482
Rick realizes what's about to happen.

471
00:23:46,517 --> 00:23:50,319
Tries to talk him down. Tries
to appeal to his old friend.

472
00:23:50,355 --> 00:23:52,621
You're gonna have to
kill an unarmed man.

473
00:23:52,657 --> 00:23:55,958
But he realizes that to
survive, he has to kill Shane.

474
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,157
And he's able to do it.

475
00:24:01,332 --> 00:24:02,431
Dad?

476
00:24:04,492 --> 00:24:05,991
Carl...

477
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:10,889
Carl's father kills Shane

478
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,912
because Shane was about to kill him.

479
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,261
And Shane reanimates.

480
00:24:16,432 --> 00:24:19,113
And Carl has to put him down.

481
00:24:20,491 --> 00:24:22,985
That was a big turning point for Carl

482
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,820
because, you know, it's
his first zombie kill

483
00:24:24,856 --> 00:24:27,727
and one of his best friends at the time.

484
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:34,930
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

485
00:24:34,966 --> 00:24:38,567
The shots bring the horde to the farm.

486
00:24:40,638 --> 00:24:43,914
And they light the barn on
fire so they can make an escape.

487
00:24:49,954 --> 00:24:51,881
- We have to go.
- It's my farm!

488
00:24:51,916 --> 00:24:53,851
Not anymore! Come on!

489
00:24:55,153 --> 00:24:57,920
The farm is overrun.
They've had to flee.

490
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:00,656
Wait! Wait!

491
00:25:00,681 --> 00:25:03,926
Some of them have been separated.
Andrea's no longer with them.

492
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,234
After everybody has left the farm,

493
00:25:12,392 --> 00:25:15,566
then Rick reveals to the
whole group the big secret

494
00:25:15,591 --> 00:25:17,940
that Jenner told him back at the CDC.

495
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:19,909
We're all infected.

496
00:25:19,944 --> 00:25:21,394
What?

497
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,592
Whatever it is, we all carry it.

498
00:25:24,783 --> 00:25:28,227
So if you die naturally
or get hit by a piano,

499
00:25:28,252 --> 00:25:30,653
then you too will turn into a zombie.

500
00:25:30,688 --> 00:25:33,122
So, you know, all hope is lost.

501
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:37,193
There's no food, no fuel, no ammo.

502
00:25:37,228 --> 00:25:39,795
By the end of the season,
there's nowhere to go.

503
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:41,297
There's no peace, there's no safety.

504
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:43,432
There's no knowing what will come next.

505
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,502
♪ ♪

506
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:57,211
Season Three finds the
survivors on the road again.

507
00:25:57,246 --> 00:26:01,281
They've gotten much, much better at
clearing places and killing walkers.

508
00:26:01,316 --> 00:26:05,668
They are an incredibly
accomplished group of survivors now.

509
00:26:06,755 --> 00:26:10,123
There is a time pressure and
the ticking clock is Laurie.

510
00:26:10,158 --> 00:26:11,768
She's pregnant.

511
00:26:13,061 --> 00:26:17,463
The group comes upon this prison
after so much time on the road.

512
00:26:17,499 --> 00:26:19,215
It's perfect.

513
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,284
None of us would find an abandoned
prison and think, "awesome!"

514
00:26:22,309 --> 00:26:25,088
But for our characters,
it is sort of a haven.

515
00:26:25,113 --> 00:26:28,541
So in order to make the place
safe, the group needs to clear it.

516
00:26:33,148 --> 00:26:37,004
The fight for the prison was
very specifically designed

517
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:39,585
to be hand-to-hand combat.

518
00:26:42,682 --> 00:26:43,813
See that?

519
00:26:43,838 --> 00:26:47,299
Because we wanted to see
the level that our people

520
00:26:47,347 --> 00:26:50,564
were willing to go to take this place.

521
00:26:50,932 --> 00:26:53,199
While they're clearing out the hallways,

522
00:26:53,241 --> 00:26:57,612
Hershel is stepping over a
walker that smells a good meal.

523
00:26:57,653 --> 00:26:58,827
[chuckles]

524
00:26:59,728 --> 00:27:02,656
[screams]

525
00:27:05,383 --> 00:27:09,919
Rick thinks that, if he chops
Hershel's leg off quick enough,

526
00:27:09,955 --> 00:27:12,455
maybe he's not gonna turn.

527
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:15,278
- Whack!
- Whack!

528
00:27:15,303 --> 00:27:17,459
You can make it from a walker bite

529
00:27:17,494 --> 00:27:19,361
if you catch it early enough.

530
00:27:19,396 --> 00:27:23,198
It was one of the weirdest,
most unpleasant scenes

531
00:27:23,233 --> 00:27:25,968
I've ever had the bad
fortune of shooting.

532
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:31,049
Walkers!

533
00:27:31,074 --> 00:27:32,669
Laurie?

534
00:27:33,502 --> 00:27:34,609
Carl?

535
00:27:34,645 --> 00:27:36,445
The prison gets compromised.

536
00:27:39,073 --> 00:27:40,949
It's mayhem, it's chaos.

537
00:27:41,446 --> 00:27:44,786
Going down the corridor,
Carol runs out of ammunition.

538
00:27:44,822 --> 00:27:46,855
- Let's go back!
- No! We're close!

539
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,641
And T-Dog sacrifices himself.

540
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:50,871
Go!

541
00:27:54,198 --> 00:27:59,126
I think Carol still feels the
effects of that sacrifice today.

542
00:28:00,938 --> 00:28:02,237
In here!

543
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:06,608
The moment that Laurie goes into labor

544
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:09,204
is when she's alone
with Maggie and Carl.

545
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,313
And were separated from
the rest of the group.

546
00:28:11,348 --> 00:28:14,259
I don't even think you're fully dilated
yet. No amount of pushing is gonna help.

547
00:28:14,267 --> 00:28:17,591
We end up having to perform
an emergency C-section

548
00:28:17,616 --> 00:28:19,771
with just a trusty dagger.

549
00:28:19,806 --> 00:28:22,940
Laurie is ready to sacrifice
herself for the baby.

550
00:28:28,114 --> 00:28:29,647
Well, we can't just leave her here.

551
00:28:29,682 --> 00:28:31,849
Carl ends up realizing
that Laurie's gonna die

552
00:28:31,885 --> 00:28:34,005
and she's gonna turn into a walker.

553
00:28:34,554 --> 00:28:36,354
He wants to do the right thing.

554
00:28:38,387 --> 00:28:39,757
[gunshot]

555
00:28:39,793 --> 00:28:43,736
It's a merciful act for
him as a child to do it.

556
00:28:47,974 --> 00:28:50,008
Where is... where is she?

557
00:28:50,298 --> 00:28:53,066
It was a terrible traumatic scene.

558
00:28:53,418 --> 00:28:56,486
It was just such a heavy day that day.

559
00:28:57,374 --> 00:28:59,277
That episode was rough.

560
00:28:59,747 --> 00:29:02,380
We lost two great characters.

561
00:29:02,415 --> 00:29:03,848
It's heartbreaking.

562
00:29:03,883 --> 00:29:05,149
Judith?

563
00:29:05,945 --> 00:29:07,285
Do you think that's a good name?

564
00:29:07,921 --> 00:29:10,318
I think that's a fine name.

565
00:29:10,985 --> 00:29:13,024
Daryl wants to call the
baby Little Ass Kicker.

566
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:14,750
What, that's a good name, right?

567
00:29:14,775 --> 00:29:17,693
I don't know. It was kind of
nice holding that baby, yeah.

568
00:29:18,621 --> 00:29:22,185
In spite of his terrible trauma
that Rick's going through,

569
00:29:22,221 --> 00:29:24,502
there is new hope, there's new life.

570
00:29:24,537 --> 00:29:26,534
She looks like you.

571
00:29:27,121 --> 00:29:29,980
While the rest of the
group is at the prison,

572
00:29:30,972 --> 00:29:35,279
Andrea is saved by this mysterious
woman with a samurai sword.

573
00:29:36,824 --> 00:29:39,350
Her new friend and ally, Michonne.

574
00:29:39,385 --> 00:29:41,204
Who is Michonne?

575
00:29:42,265 --> 00:29:44,989
People always talk about that
first image and how striking it is.

576
00:29:45,024 --> 00:29:48,860
This woman in this cape with
a sword with these two walkers

577
00:29:48,895 --> 00:29:53,874
who are immobilized essentially in
terms of their ability to hurt her.

578
00:29:54,215 --> 00:29:57,635
She is a woman who's figured
out how to take care of herself.

579
00:30:03,312 --> 00:30:05,710
Andrea and Michonne are out in the world

580
00:30:05,745 --> 00:30:07,511
and they come upon
this helicopter crash.

581
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:11,215
They see that there's
another group of survivors

582
00:30:11,251 --> 00:30:15,253
and, obviously, one man in
particular who's in charge.

583
00:30:15,288 --> 00:30:16,787
Let's roll out.

584
00:30:16,823 --> 00:30:18,701
When they try to get
away from the crash site,

585
00:30:18,725 --> 00:30:22,894
they are caught by Andrea's
old friend, Merle Dixon.

586
00:30:26,894 --> 00:30:31,656
Merle takes Andrea and Michonne
to this really idyllic small town.

587
00:30:31,797 --> 00:30:33,697
Welcome to Woodbury.

588
00:30:35,575 --> 00:30:38,953
Woodbury is a very strange place.

589
00:30:39,781 --> 00:30:42,713
It's almost as if the
apocalypse never happened.

590
00:30:43,321 --> 00:30:47,108
It's safe with high
walls manned by sentries.

591
00:30:47,576 --> 00:30:49,663
- It can't be.
- It can.

592
00:30:49,688 --> 00:30:52,100
When we first meet The
Governor, he's quite a cool guy.

593
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:57,038
And he is the leader because he's
provided that security to his populace.

594
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:01,816
The Governor seems to be a charming man.

595
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:05,503
We got food, water, fresh clothes.

596
00:31:05,538 --> 00:31:08,906
But to Michonne, we're not in a world
where you can trust that quickly,

597
00:31:08,942 --> 00:31:10,875
and she does not trust that quickly.

598
00:31:11,373 --> 00:31:14,979
Andrea and Michonne have very
different reactions to The Governor.

599
00:31:15,014 --> 00:31:18,416
Andrea, she's completely
swept away by it all.

600
00:31:18,451 --> 00:31:21,185
She feels like, you know,
there's finally hope.

601
00:31:21,288 --> 00:31:24,263
There's the way he presents
himself to the world.

602
00:31:24,288 --> 00:31:27,959
We get a sense that there's something
else going on with him as well.

603
00:31:31,255 --> 00:31:33,998
Michonne starts to like really
sniff around at this place

604
00:31:34,033 --> 00:31:36,334
and finds walkers in the cage.

605
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:38,086
What is going on here?

606
00:31:38,364 --> 00:31:39,437
She has to leave.

607
00:31:39,472 --> 00:31:44,208
This place is not what they say it is.

608
00:31:44,243 --> 00:31:46,177
Andrea still won't leave.

609
00:31:46,212 --> 00:31:49,350
She and Andrea just have
to part ways at that gate.

610
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:54,652
The Governor sees that Michonne
is someone to be reckoned with.

611
00:31:54,687 --> 00:31:56,565
The Governor tells Merle
to go out and kill her.

612
00:31:56,589 --> 00:31:58,823
Go and get her and bring back her head.

613
00:31:58,858 --> 00:32:01,492
And he's not talking in
any sort of code there.

614
00:32:01,527 --> 00:32:03,788
That's what he wants. He wants her head.

615
00:32:04,241 --> 00:32:07,475
But she's a warrior.
She's a one-woman army.

616
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,773
But then she witnesses Glenn and
Maggie getting kidnapped by Merle.

617
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:18,928
Maggie and Glenn are on a run
for formula for baby Judith.

618
00:32:18,953 --> 00:32:20,821
We run into Merle.

619
00:32:20,948 --> 00:32:23,180
Merle, you made it.

620
00:32:23,216 --> 00:32:26,584
This tumbles out into him kidnapping us.

621
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,865
Merle takes them back to Woodbury.

622
00:32:30,213 --> 00:32:31,984
So Maggie and Glenn, who are they?

623
00:32:32,009 --> 00:32:35,246
Where are they from?
Are there more of them?

624
00:32:37,053 --> 00:32:39,888
- So you gonna talk?
- Go to hell.

625
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:43,250
And he realizes that the way to get
the answers to the questions he wants

626
00:32:43,275 --> 00:32:46,472
is to threaten Glenn
to break down Maggie.

627
00:32:46,507 --> 00:32:49,840
And she gives up that
they have a prison.

628
00:32:52,268 --> 00:32:56,036
So then he has a target
to get that prison.

629
00:32:57,683 --> 00:33:00,056
Michonne found her way to the prison.

630
00:33:00,238 --> 00:33:05,314
Rick is extraordinarily
confused about this mirage

631
00:33:05,339 --> 00:33:07,393
of this dread-locked Samurai woman.

632
00:33:07,428 --> 00:33:09,929
For her, that moment at the
fence is very vulnerable.

633
00:33:09,964 --> 00:33:12,164
She's wounded, she's in need of others.

634
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,611
And she's looking at this man knowing
I think I need to be on your side.

635
00:33:16,976 --> 00:33:21,140
Michonne wins her way into the group
by bringing the formula for the baby.

636
00:33:21,175 --> 00:33:24,210
Michonne tells Rick that The
Governor has Maggie and Glenn.

637
00:33:24,245 --> 00:33:28,414
Pretty boy, charming, Jim Jones type.

638
00:33:28,449 --> 00:33:31,668
Rick says we're gonna have
to have a counter strike.

639
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,601
We're going to go and save them.

As Season Three continues,

00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,453
Maggie and Glenn are
being held in Woodbury.

646
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:56,671

have to form a little strike team

to break into Woodbury
to try and rescue them.

648
00:34:02,631 --> 00:34:05,299
Michonne has her own agenda.

She goes to The Governor's
apartment searching for The Governor.

And there she finds something else.

651

Several aquariums
filled with walker heads.

652
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:18,969
Those are his trophies. Ladies,
watch out for your man's mancaves.

You never know what you might find.

No!

658
00:34:34,029 --> 00:34:36,263
The Governor's daughter is a walker.

Holding a gun to her friend's
head and defending this man.

The Governor loses his humanity,

his revenge against the world.

00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:37,198

Merle's own brother!

00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:44,483
Andrea, who is in the

You have all these townspeople
like, "Kill him, kill him!"

Then we go back to back. And then
we're trying to break out of the place

and bust me out of there.

00:36:28,088 --> 00:36:30,875
And he thinks his punishment is to live.

689
00:36:31,112 --> 00:36:33,852
You can come back from
this. I know you can.

690
00:36:34,043 --> 00:36:36,177
We have a community. We have a prison.

691
00:36:36,457 --> 00:36:39,225
You got to come. And he can't go.

692
00:36:40,891 --> 00:36:42,937
Why didn't you tell me they were here?

693
00:36:42,963 --> 00:36:47,298
Andrea discovers that the
"terrorists" are actually her friends.

694
00:36:47,548 --> 00:36:49,414
And it's very unsettling.

695
00:36:49,547 --> 00:36:52,637
Her primary goal is to broker peace.

696
00:36:52,672 --> 00:36:54,806
Rick and The Governor meet.

697
00:36:54,841 --> 00:36:56,775
It's all very sort of tense.

698
00:36:57,557 --> 00:36:59,827
I want Michonne.

699
00:37:00,128 --> 00:37:02,731
Turn her over, and this all goes away.

700
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:06,785
Rick's not willing to
trade Michonne for anything.

701
00:37:07,236 --> 00:37:09,116
We're going to war.

702
00:37:09,141 --> 00:37:12,062
Merle decides he's gonna
kill The Governor himself to,

703
00:37:12,212 --> 00:37:14,526
you know, save the group
and save his little brother.

704
00:37:15,113 --> 00:37:18,797
The Governor and Merle have a
showdown. A humdinger of a fight.

705
00:37:18,832 --> 00:37:21,633
Halfway through the fight,
I bite his fingers off.

706
00:37:22,631 --> 00:37:25,136
I mean, once you've bitten
someone's fingers off, you know,

707
00:37:25,172 --> 00:37:27,108
there's no going back from that really.

708
00:37:28,545 --> 00:37:30,211
Then Daryl finds him.

709
00:37:32,767 --> 00:37:35,046
That was another really, really sad day.

710
00:37:35,081 --> 00:37:37,916
You know, Daryl, he has to put him down.

711
00:37:40,187 --> 00:37:42,520
He doesn't stab him once or twice.

712
00:37:42,556 --> 00:37:45,323
He relentlessly just
stabs him into the ground.

713
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:47,492
And it's not even like he's
trying to kill something.

714
00:37:47,527 --> 00:37:49,961
He's just fed up with this is how it is.

715
00:37:49,996 --> 00:37:52,263
And you just can't win in this world.

716
00:37:53,867 --> 00:37:57,102
Andrea realizes that she's
chosen the wrong side.

717
00:37:57,325 --> 00:37:59,270
That actually she wants
to be back with Rick.

718
00:37:59,306 --> 00:38:02,240
She wants to be back with Michonne.
She wants to be back with that group.

719
00:38:05,646 --> 00:38:08,480
Any loyalty that he had for Andrea,

720
00:38:08,515 --> 00:38:11,592
any love he had towards her was lost.

721
00:38:12,205 --> 00:38:14,043
He takes her back to Woodbury

722
00:38:14,179 --> 00:38:16,354
and he ties her to a dentist chair

723
00:38:16,389 --> 00:38:18,889
and he kills one of his men...

724
00:38:21,261 --> 00:38:24,596
and leaves him in the room knowing
that this man will turn into a walker.

725
00:38:24,933 --> 00:38:28,134
And you're gonna tear
the flesh from her bones.

726
00:38:29,336 --> 00:38:31,803
We end this once and for all!

727
00:38:37,037 --> 00:38:39,376
When The Governor comes with his men,

728
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:42,624
we lull them into a
false sense of security.

729
00:38:44,871 --> 00:38:47,105
And then we counter strike.

730
00:38:49,797 --> 00:38:51,856
Our soldiers who are
not really soldiers,

731
00:38:51,892 --> 00:38:53,958
they're people from my town with guns,

732
00:38:53,994 --> 00:38:55,059
they panic and they run.

733
00:38:55,095 --> 00:38:56,643
What the hell are you doing?

734
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,664
We're done fighting for a hole with
a half dozen psychopaths living in it!

735
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:01,499
- They can keep it!
- We are not soldiers!

736
00:39:01,535 --> 00:39:06,337
And he just has this total red
mist that comes down over him.

737
00:39:15,315 --> 00:39:16,514
What are you doing here?

738
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,382
Andrea might be here.

739
00:39:20,382 --> 00:39:22,239
The group comes to save Andrea.

740
00:39:22,264 --> 00:39:23,463
Andrea!

741
00:39:26,266 --> 00:39:27,425
But they're too late.

742
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,893
You're burning up.

743
00:39:28,929 --> 00:39:30,695
She'd been bit in a
place that, you know,

744
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:33,083
they can't chop off her leg
like they did with Hershel.

745
00:39:33,108 --> 00:39:34,641
This is a death bite.

746
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:36,666
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

747
00:39:38,572 --> 00:39:42,240
She is dying, but they actually
get that chance to say goodbye.

748
00:39:42,275 --> 00:39:44,609
And I was very grateful
that they got to do that.

749
00:39:44,644 --> 00:39:46,411
I loved Andrea's death.

750
00:39:46,446 --> 00:39:49,113
She was surrounded by
the people that she loved

751
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,817
and she died with such
integrity and grace.

752

[gunshot]

753
00:39:59,225 --> 00:40:00,758
At the end of Season Three,

754
00:40:00,794 --> 00:40:03,428
Rick and our group at the prison

755
00:40:03,463 --> 00:40:06,631
take in the refugees from Woodbury.

756
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:08,930
As safe as he may think that place is,

757
00:40:08,955 --> 00:40:10,813
and as much as he thinks that
he is helping those people,

758
00:40:10,837 --> 00:40:13,786
The Governor is still out there.
So there is still a threat looming.

♪ ♪

760
00:40:26,641 --> 00:40:28,005
At the beginning of Season Four,

761
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:31,320
the group finds itself
more or less flourishing.

762
00:40:32,482 --> 00:40:36,419
I got other plans involving
dirt and cucumbers.

763
00:40:36,442 --> 00:40:39,677
Rick has decided to not be in conflict.

764
00:40:39,712 --> 00:40:41,145
He's renounced leadership.

765
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,347
They formed a council.

766
00:40:43,383 --> 00:40:46,317
They determine what is to the
best interest of the group.

767
00:40:46,352 --> 00:40:51,222
This prison is solidifying
as a nice little civilization.

Give the stranger sanctuary,

keeping people fed. You're gonna
have to learn to live with the love.

770
00:40:56,296 --> 00:40:59,872
We have some new faces. You know, we
met Tyreese and Sasha in Season Three.

771
00:40:59,897 --> 00:41:01,399
They had ended up at Woodbury

772
00:41:01,434 --> 00:41:04,001
but would not participate
in the attack on the prison.

773
00:41:04,037 --> 00:41:06,771
Tyreese and Sasha are
brother and sister.

774
00:41:07,081 --> 00:41:08,940
We go in, stay in
formation for the sweep.

775
00:41:08,975 --> 00:41:09,978
Any questions?

776
00:41:10,003 --> 00:41:12,280
Sasha is a very pragmatic woman.

777
00:41:12,305 --> 00:41:14,312
She looks at things
very black and white.

778
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:16,492
Is there ever a time that
you weren't the boss of me?

779
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:17,893
You had a few years before I was born.

780
00:41:17,917 --> 00:41:20,318
Tyreese is the ultimate everyday man.

781
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:25,513
He's a thoughtful individual who never
lost the value and sanctity of life.

782
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:29,660
Hey, like to start pulling
my weight around here.

783
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:33,264
Bob is a loner. He was
a medic in the military.

784
00:41:33,678 --> 00:41:35,866
You were out on your
own when Daryl found you.

785
00:41:35,902 --> 00:41:36,986
That's right.

786
00:41:37,011 --> 00:41:39,904
I just wanna make sure you
know how to play on a team.

787
00:41:41,574 --> 00:41:44,442
Michonne is spending some
time looking for The Governor.

788
00:41:44,477 --> 00:41:46,944
Thinking of looking over near Macon.

789
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,479
It's worth a shot.

790
00:41:48,514 --> 00:41:49,947
Hi, Nan!

791
00:41:49,983 --> 00:41:51,582
You're naming them?

792
00:41:51,618 --> 00:41:53,684
They don't talk. They don't think.

793
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,453
They eat people.

794
00:41:55,488 --> 00:41:57,521
At the prison, Carol
takes it upon herself

795
00:41:57,557 --> 00:42:00,992
to teach the children
their survival skills.

796
00:42:01,027 --> 00:42:02,860
Today we're gonna learn
how to hold a knife.

797
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,196
Part of this weapons training comes from

798
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:08,299
Carol feeling the guilt
over the loss of Sophia.

799
00:42:08,334 --> 00:42:11,669
How to stab and slash
and where to aim for.

800
00:42:11,704 --> 00:42:13,404
I'm not feeling very well.

801
00:42:16,109 --> 00:42:20,678
There is this strange,
inexplicable virus going around.

802
00:42:20,713 --> 00:42:22,580
We have no idea where it came from.

803
00:42:22,615 --> 00:42:25,082
How could somebody in a
day die just from a cold?

804
00:42:25,118 --> 00:42:27,551
When you die, you become a walker.

805
00:42:27,805 --> 00:42:30,121
- There's a threat.
- [growls]

806
00:42:30,156 --> 00:42:32,456
They decide to quarantine the sick.

807
00:42:37,234 --> 00:42:40,631
Somebody has been
murdering infected people.

808
00:42:40,667 --> 00:42:42,667
One of them being Tyreese's girlfriend.

809
00:42:42,702 --> 00:42:44,546
You find out who did this,
and you bring 'em to me!

810
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:47,471
You understand? You bring 'em to me!

811
00:42:47,507 --> 00:42:52,476
It looks like maybe someone was trying
to keep this virus from spreading.

812
00:42:52,741 --> 00:42:55,346
Glenn and Sasha,
unfortunately, are infected.

813
00:42:55,381 --> 00:42:58,482
There are no medications
really in the prison.

814
00:42:58,518 --> 00:43:01,361
Bob, being the ex-army medic that he is,

815
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:03,511
knows what we can get that can help.

816
00:43:06,726 --> 00:43:09,493
Anything ending with
"cillin" or "cin", grab it.

817
00:43:09,529 --> 00:43:12,430
At the same time, the prison ends up

818
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:15,499
compromised by tons and tons of walkers.

819
00:43:15,535 --> 00:43:17,168
Carl gets to fire a lot of guns.

820
00:43:17,211 --> 00:43:22,671
But I couldn't actually legally hold
any kind of firearm until I turned 14.

821
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,111
At midnight on my 14th birthday,

822
00:43:25,136 --> 00:43:28,379
Andy came over, and he knighted
me with the machine gun and...

823
00:43:33,634 --> 00:43:35,744
Which was great.

824
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:39,834
Bob came back just in the
nick of time to save people.

825
00:43:42,588 --> 00:43:46,564
Rick has an inkling that Carol may
have killed the infected people.

826
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:48,807
Did you kill Karen and David?

827
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:50,701
Yes.

828
00:43:51,213 --> 00:43:53,204
Rick takes Carol out on a run.

829
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:57,041
For the sake of his own child
and the safety and security

830
00:43:57,076 --> 00:43:59,076
of all the people in the prison,

831
00:43:59,112 --> 00:44:01,901
he decides on his own to exile her.

832
00:44:02,401 --> 00:44:05,983
You're not that woman who was too
scared to be alone. Not anymore.

833
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:11,956
So The Governor is now on his own.

834
00:44:11,991 --> 00:44:15,392
And he's in this catatonic state.

835
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:20,931
He's burnt down his town in his madness.

836
00:44:20,967 --> 00:44:23,167
He has just been walking the roads

837
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:25,336
and surviving by default.

838
00:44:26,672 --> 00:44:29,440
He discovers a family
living in an apartment

839
00:44:29,475 --> 00:44:31,475
and becomes very close with them.

840
00:44:31,511 --> 00:44:35,212
You mess with me or my family, I
swear to Christ, I will put you down.

841
00:44:35,248 --> 00:44:37,481
Tara is living in this
apartment building.

842
00:44:37,517 --> 00:44:39,194
She's been there for about
a year with her family.

843
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,519
And she takes care of
her niece and her sister.

844
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:45,089
You, me, your Mom and
Tara, we're gonna be okay.

845
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,868
Tara and her family think
he's kind of a good guy,

846
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:50,443
but we don't know his whole back story.

847
00:44:51,672 --> 00:44:53,438
[screams]

848
00:44:55,635 --> 00:45:00,938
The Governor, being this spiteful
and vengeful person, wants the prison.

849
00:45:00,973 --> 00:45:04,431
The people in this prison are,
most of them, thieves, murderers.

850
00:45:04,456 --> 00:45:08,012
The Governor had convinced her that
these were really, really evil people.

851
00:45:08,047 --> 00:45:10,114
I captured two of them.

852
00:45:11,984 --> 00:45:15,753
Now he's using them as hostages
and trying to use them as leverage.

853
00:45:18,558 --> 00:45:21,901
You and your people, you have
'til sundown to get outta here!

854
00:45:21,926 --> 00:45:23,360
Or they die.

855
00:45:23,396 --> 00:45:27,364
Rick sees a glimmer of
opportunity with The Governor.

856
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,722
We can all live together.

857
00:45:32,706 --> 00:45:36,540
We've all done the worst kinds
of things just to stay alive.

858
00:45:36,615 --> 00:45:38,441
But we can still come back.

859
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:42,112
We all can change.

860
00:45:42,266 --> 00:45:43,618
Liar.

861
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:47,718
That death was so gross.

862
00:45:47,753 --> 00:45:51,155
Many of us say it's pretty much
the most traumatizing death...

863
00:45:51,528 --> 00:45:52,923
we've been through.

864
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:54,925
From then on, it's war.

865
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:56,794
No!

00:46:00,204 --> 00:46:01,778
Mayhem ensues.

00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:05,167
As always, on our show.

869
00:46:06,175 --> 00:46:10,040
The Governor gets Rick, beats him up.

870
00:46:11,244 --> 00:46:15,045
Michonne sticks her knife
straight through into The Governor.

871
00:46:15,081 --> 00:46:17,715
Which I think is great.
But he's not dead.

872
00:46:18,147 --> 00:46:21,552
Tara's sister pulls
out a gun and kills him.

873
00:46:25,312 --> 00:46:28,959
The walls are breached.
The community is shattered.

874
00:46:29,164 --> 00:46:31,536
There's no way of finding
out who went where.

875
00:46:31,564 --> 00:46:35,399
What happened to whom? We got
flung into several directions.

876
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:41,906
Tragically, Rick thinks
that Judith is dead.

877
00:46:41,941 --> 00:46:44,441
Don't look back, Carl!

878
00:46:44,477 --> 00:46:46,523

880
00:46:59,478 --> 00:47:02,775
After the battle at the
prison, the group is scattered.

881
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,381
We get flung into several directions.

882
00:47:05,445 --> 00:47:07,379
And we all go through different things.

883
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:10,802
We don't know how they're ever
possibly gonna see each other again.

884
00:47:12,178 --> 00:47:15,713
Then they start seeing these
signs for this place, Terminus.

885
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:18,983
Everyone will probably see
this sign and head that way.

886
00:47:19,019 --> 00:47:22,487
And that's where we can meet back
up with our crew, with our family.

887

Daryl and Beth flee the prison together.

888
00:47:29,095 --> 00:47:33,231
He's protecting her. It's
a very weird back and forth.

00:47:33,266 --> 00:47:36,167
- Screw you! You don't get it!
- No! You don't get it!

890
00:47:36,202 --> 00:47:37,869
Everyone we know is dead!

891
00:47:37,904 --> 00:47:39,904
And I think Daryl's feeling guilty.

892
00:47:40,161 --> 00:47:42,302
The Governor rode right up to our gates!

893
00:47:42,327 --> 00:47:45,295
I could have prevented it.
But he probably couldn't have.

894
00:47:46,759 --> 00:47:47,745
Beth!

895
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:48,894
We get attacked.

896
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:51,656
Run!

897
00:47:54,057 --> 00:47:57,629
Daryl sees the car driving away
with a white cross on the back of it.

898
00:47:57,657 --> 00:47:59,526
He knows that someone took her.

899
00:48:00,293 --> 00:48:01,959
That was just devastating.

900
00:48:01,995 --> 00:48:05,430
He chased that car all night
long until it was daylight

901
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,765
and he just couldn't move anymore.

902
00:48:08,243 --> 00:48:10,935
- We should go.
- I thought we were looking for Glenn.

903
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:14,101
We don't know if anyone else
survived the prison attack.

904
00:48:14,126 --> 00:48:17,508
We don't know how long we can
make it out here in the woods.

905
00:48:17,544 --> 00:48:20,845
If he saw one of these, he would
go looking for me looking for him.

907
00:48:24,417 --> 00:48:29,220
In the meantime, Glenn is still
at the prison weakened by the flu.

00:48:29,255 --> 00:48:30,636
Maggie?

909
00:48:31,985 --> 00:48:34,057
He takes it upon himself
to go look for people.

910
00:48:34,082 --> 00:48:36,462
So he gears up, heads out.

911
00:48:37,654 --> 00:48:40,965
And right when he's about to
leave is when he spots Tara.

912
00:48:41,573 --> 00:48:43,134
Why would you want my help?

913
00:48:43,517 --> 00:48:45,069
I don't want it. I need it.

914
00:48:45,105 --> 00:48:46,537
I have to find Maggie.

915
00:48:46,573 --> 00:48:49,240
I think that ignites a
bit of purpose in her.

Hope you enjoyed the show, assholes!

917
00:48:54,068 --> 00:48:56,347
You got a damn mouth
on you, you know that?

00:48:56,383 --> 00:48:58,816
They run into another set of people.

919
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:00,651
Abraham, Eugene and Rosita.

00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:02,553
You're a damn mess.

00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:11,062
Everyone needs an Abraham
Ford on their team.

He's no-nonsense, highly
capable and he has a goal.

We're on a mission to get
Eugene to Washington, D.C.

924
00:49:17,504 --> 00:49:19,103
Eugene's a scientist.

925
00:49:19,139 --> 00:49:21,406
Eugene knows what caused the apocalypse.

926
00:49:21,441 --> 00:49:23,775
And not only does he know
what caused the apocalypse,

927
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:25,376
he knows how to stop it.

928
00:49:25,689 --> 00:49:28,356
Trust me. I'm smarter than you.

929
00:49:28,505 --> 00:49:32,984
You buy it instantly because
there's basically no hope.

930
00:49:33,019 --> 00:49:34,903
But he also has a mullet.

931
00:49:34,982 --> 00:49:38,556
Every minute we waste getting him
to Washington, people are dying.

932
00:49:38,591 --> 00:49:40,091
You think I don't understand that?

933
00:49:40,339 --> 00:49:43,294
I want us to actually get there.

934
00:49:43,768 --> 00:49:46,831
Rosita is a member of Abraham's army.

935
00:49:46,866 --> 00:49:51,992
She's a very determined, very
independent, very strong young woman.

936
00:49:52,174 --> 00:49:54,636
She's in a romantic
relationship with Abraham.

937
00:49:54,661 --> 00:49:56,672
She's been trained by Abraham.

Abraham lets Glenn know
what our mission is.

Hope you guys make it to Washington.

00:50:01,214 --> 00:50:03,714
Glenn wants to complete his mission.

Glenn and Maggie find
each other through fate.

You don't need a picture of me.

You never will again.

00:50:29,008 --> 00:50:31,509
In that moment, he's blessed.

948
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:34,412
And then they head to Terminus.

949
00:50:34,889 --> 00:50:38,282
They're hoping that they can run
into the rest of the group there.

You find Tyreese being Mr. Daddy
Daycare with Lizzie, Mika and Judith.

How? How?

Carol is not quite sure if he knows that
she is the one who killed his beloved.

954
00:50:58,569 --> 00:51:01,212
- I didn't see you get out.
- I wasn't there.

protecting the children of this world.

What if I killed you?
What if I killed you!

00:51:11,217 --> 00:51:15,019
You have one child who
doesn't want to kill anything.

959
00:51:15,054 --> 00:51:16,721
I couldn't pull the trigger.

960
00:51:16,746 --> 00:51:18,820
And another one who wants to kill,

961
00:51:18,845 --> 00:51:21,957
because she wants them to come
back so that they'll live forever.

962
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:25,298
Don't worry. She'll come back.

963
00:51:25,851 --> 00:51:27,951
I didn't hurt her brain.

964
00:51:28,701 --> 00:51:30,902
Lizzie has killed he sister, Mika.

965
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,771
She's prepared to take Judith out next.

966
00:51:34,255 --> 00:51:38,596
Carol feels that the best
thing to do is take Lizzie out.

967
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:41,178
Look at the flowers, Lizzie.

968
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,053
She had to do that for the
security and safety of Judith.

969
00:51:49,088 --> 00:51:51,255
It's ethically very confusing.

970
00:51:51,703 --> 00:51:53,925
For anybody, it's horrible.

971
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:58,029
For a woman who's lost a
daughter, it's unthinkable.

972
00:51:59,885 --> 00:52:04,368
Carol confesses to Tyreese
that she killed his beloved.

973
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:06,370
You do what you have to do.

974
00:52:06,406 --> 00:52:11,300
And Tyreese reacts by giving her the
greatest and most unexpected gift.

975
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:13,363
I forgive you.

976
00:52:16,583 --> 00:52:19,067
Rick, Carl and Michonne reunite.

977
00:52:20,253 --> 00:52:22,702
- What?
- It's for you.

978
00:52:22,727 --> 00:52:24,900
The beauty is that they had
found each other at least.

979
00:52:24,924 --> 00:52:28,025
Now you follow her lead, understand?

980
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:30,139
They find the Terminus road
and they start to go on it.

981
00:52:30,163 --> 00:52:32,063
But that whole journey is a dire one.

982
00:52:32,098 --> 00:52:34,561
There's very little food.
There's very little supplies.

983
00:52:34,586 --> 00:52:35,733
There's very little water.

984
00:52:35,768 --> 00:52:38,469
Maybe this place isn't
even there anymore.

985
00:52:39,215 --> 00:52:41,105
You screwed up, asshole.

986
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:43,174
We run into this group
called the Claimers.

987
00:52:43,209 --> 00:52:46,544
They seemed to be a very
ferocious, feral group.

988
00:52:46,579 --> 00:52:49,747
These guys are really, really bad news.

989
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:52,650
Pull up.

990
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:55,486
These people... don't let 'em go.

991
00:52:55,521 --> 00:52:59,657
Daryl is in such a dark state
of mind because he lost Beth.

992
00:52:59,692 --> 00:53:01,692
Then he found this other group.

993
00:53:01,728 --> 00:53:03,995
And he's just following
them just to follow them.

994
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:05,796
He's looking for a way out.

995
00:53:05,832 --> 00:53:09,940
They captured his friends and
now it's a little too late.

996
00:53:10,536 --> 00:53:14,839
One of them seems hell-bent on attacking
Carl in ways that are unspeakable.

997
00:53:14,874 --> 00:53:17,666
What the hell you gonna do now, sport?

998
00:53:20,186 --> 00:53:23,331
We put blood tubes in there.
We put raw steak in there.

999
00:53:23,383 --> 00:53:27,618
He had actually meat in his
mouth and just spit it off.

1000
00:53:28,061 --> 00:53:30,504
I think you should ask the
guy whose throat I ripped out

1001
00:53:30,529 --> 00:53:33,491
what his opinion of it was. [laughs]

1002
00:53:33,526 --> 00:53:34,950
You know, I think this
is something that Michonne

1003
00:53:34,974 --> 00:53:36,661
always loved and admires about Rick

1004
00:53:36,696 --> 00:53:39,397
is that he will fight for his child.

1005
00:53:39,688 --> 00:53:42,667
You being back with us
here, now, that's everything.

1006
00:53:42,702 --> 00:53:44,635
You're my brother.

1007
00:53:45,037 --> 00:53:50,608
That bond between Rick and
Daryl is stronger than ever.

1008
00:53:50,643 --> 00:53:53,644
Rick becomes the brother
that Merle couldn't have been.

1009
00:53:56,215 --> 00:53:58,282
Those who arrive survive.

Terminus.

1011
00:53:59,449 --> 00:54:01,819
When our people arrive in Terminus,

1012
00:54:01,854 --> 00:54:05,122
they're essentially breaking
into this stronghold.

1013
00:54:07,226 --> 00:54:09,326
Welcome to Terminus.

1014
00:54:09,362 --> 00:54:10,928
Gareth is essentially the leader.

1015
00:54:10,963 --> 00:54:12,763
He's unassuming, he's calm.

1016
00:54:12,799 --> 00:54:14,098
He's not hostile.

1017
00:54:14,133 --> 00:54:16,534
You're nervous. I get it.
We were all the same way.

1018
00:54:16,569 --> 00:54:17,802
We came here for sanctuary.

1019
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:20,149
Terminus is an interesting place.
There's a lot of people there.

1020
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:22,707
They're definitely organized.
They've been making these maps.

1021
00:54:22,742 --> 00:54:26,310
It looks very much like someplace
they could have some hope.

1022
00:54:26,345 --> 00:54:28,012
Why do you let people in?

1023
00:54:28,047 --> 00:54:30,214
More people become a part
of this, we get stronger.

1024
00:54:30,249 --> 00:54:34,585
Rick very quickly realizes
that all is not as it seems.

1025
00:54:36,255 --> 00:54:38,823
Rick notices Glenn's watch.

1026
00:54:43,129 --> 00:54:45,062
Where the hell did you get this watch?

1027
00:54:45,098 --> 00:54:48,477
Gareth is... he's prepared for this.

00:54:51,604 --> 00:54:55,596
Gareth and his minions at
Terminus literally herd the group.

1030
00:54:57,526 --> 00:54:58,909
Drop your weapons!

1031
00:54:58,945 --> 00:55:02,183
And to be herded like
cattle into this train car...

1032
00:55:02,614 --> 00:55:04,193
Rick?

1033
00:55:04,484 --> 00:55:06,083
You're here.

1034
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:08,897
It's a pretty low place to leave your
characters at the end of the season,

1035
00:55:08,921 --> 00:55:10,554
which is why we liked it so much.

1036
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:12,857
They're screwing with the wrong people.

1037
00:55:18,674 --> 00:55:20,975
♪ ♪

1038
00:55:25,624 --> 00:55:26,996
At the start of Season Five,

1039
00:55:27,021 --> 00:55:29,417
we're exactly where we were
at the end of Season Four.

1040
00:55:29,466 --> 00:55:31,629
Most of our characters
are trapped at Terminus.

1041
00:55:31,804 --> 00:55:34,402
It turns out Terminus
is a cannibal society.

1042
00:55:34,438 --> 00:55:39,040
And they're about to kill
them to use them as food.

1043
00:55:41,044 --> 00:55:42,744
Oh, the trough.

1044
00:55:42,779 --> 00:55:46,014
That was another moment that we
were pretty sure we went too far.

1045
00:55:46,049 --> 00:55:49,417
I was looking down the line and
I couldn't see the blood rigs.

1046
00:55:49,453 --> 00:55:53,288
So it looked like people were
really having their throats slit.

1047
00:55:53,323 --> 00:55:55,824
- Don't do this. We can fix this.
- No, you can't.

1048
00:55:55,859 --> 00:55:58,380
It's weird to think of yourself as food.

1049
00:55:59,629 --> 00:56:02,249
You have two hours to
get them on the dryers.

[explosion]

1051
00:56:07,971 --> 00:56:11,183
Carol's a badass. You
need Carol sometimes.

1052
00:56:11,398 --> 00:56:15,176
Carol disguises herself as a walker
and makes her way into Terminus

1053
00:56:15,212 --> 00:56:17,545
and starts taking out the bad guys.

1054
00:56:17,581 --> 00:56:19,625
The men they pulled from that
train car, where are they?

1055

[screams]

1056
00:56:20,884 --> 00:56:25,353
Rick very quickly realizes that
there's something going on outside.

1057
00:56:25,388 --> 00:56:28,757
If he can cut himself
free, he can escape.

1058
00:56:31,201 --> 00:56:33,352
Come on! We fight to the fence!

1059
00:56:39,269 --> 00:56:41,269
I think I killed 80
people in that episode.

1060
00:56:41,462 --> 00:56:44,797
As we're leaving, Carol
pops out of the woods.

1061
00:56:45,221 --> 00:56:47,488
Did you do that?

1062
00:56:50,313 --> 00:56:53,948
She just saved us
from becoming sausages.

1063
00:56:53,992 --> 00:56:56,456
She helped save Judith,

1064
00:56:56,775 --> 00:56:59,028
and helped save their lives.

1065
00:56:59,308 --> 00:57:01,067
All is forgiven.

You okay?

1068
00:57:15,252 --> 00:57:19,340
He meets Father Gabriel. And
he's like how are you still here?

1069
00:57:19,777 --> 00:57:23,431
Father Gabriel is a priest
who, when things got really bad,

1070
00:57:23,456 --> 00:57:26,247
locked his entire
congregation out of his church.

1071
00:57:26,283 --> 00:57:29,766
Entire families calling my
name as they were torn apart!

1072
00:57:29,791 --> 00:57:33,555
And part of his hell is that he's
still alive to have to go through it.

1073
00:57:33,590 --> 00:57:35,417
To relive it every day.

1074
00:57:35,659 --> 00:57:38,026
He tells us that he has his church.

1075
00:57:38,061 --> 00:57:40,876
He has this safe place.
He invites us to come back.

1076
00:57:40,901 --> 00:57:42,875
But Carol is not quite
comfortable with it.

1077
00:57:42,899 --> 00:57:44,392
She's gotta get out of there.

1078
00:57:46,271 --> 00:57:47,435
Carol sneaks out.

1079
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:48,937
Daryl goes and looks for her

1080
00:57:48,972 --> 00:57:51,339
and he doesn't want her to leave again.

1081
00:57:53,295 --> 00:57:54,224
Whoa! Get in.

1082
00:57:54,249 --> 00:57:55,810
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1083
00:57:55,846 --> 00:57:57,078
They got Beth!

1084
00:57:57,113 --> 00:57:59,792
There goes the car. And it's
a very distinct looking car.

1085
00:57:59,816 --> 00:58:01,669
And, you know, they head to Atlanta.

1086
00:58:02,147 --> 00:58:03,284
This was the food bank.

1087
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:07,233
Meanwhile, we all go with
Father Gabriel out for a run.

1088
00:58:07,258 --> 00:58:09,495
Then Bob actually gets bitten.

1089
00:58:11,828 --> 00:58:13,828
He doesn't tell anyone.

1090
00:58:14,171 --> 00:58:17,599
We go back to the church,
and we're all celebrating.

1091
00:58:17,634 --> 00:58:21,868
At the same time, Bob is slowly
dying from his walker bite.

1092
00:58:21,893 --> 00:58:24,239
So he just sort of wanders off.

1093
00:58:24,274 --> 00:58:27,051
He leaves and then he
gets caught by Gareth.

1094
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:32,203
I just hope you understand

1095
00:58:33,149 --> 00:58:35,775
that nothing happening
to you now is personal.

1096
00:58:37,053 --> 00:58:38,645
A man's got to eat.

1097
00:58:39,962 --> 00:58:42,757
You taste much better
than we thought you would.

1098
00:58:42,792 --> 00:58:44,440
When are you ever gonna see...

1099
00:58:44,465 --> 00:58:47,832
a person literally eating somebody
else's flesh in front of him?

1100
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:48,930
I mean, it's crazy.

1101
00:58:48,965 --> 00:58:51,466
I've been bitten, you stupid pricks!

1102
00:58:51,501 --> 00:58:54,202
[laughs]

1103
00:58:54,237 --> 00:58:57,505
Bob gets the last laugh,
which is fitting for Bob.

1104
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:59,425
Tainted meat!

1105
00:59:01,092 --> 00:59:03,127
Bob! Bob!

1106
00:59:03,914 --> 00:59:07,348
The surviving members of Terminus
are coming to hunt them down.

1107
00:59:07,384 --> 00:59:09,150
So now they're locked in this church

1108
00:59:09,185 --> 00:59:11,274
trying to figure out
how to survive the night.

1109
00:59:11,655 --> 00:59:13,314
We know...

1110
00:59:14,506 --> 00:59:15,757
you're here.

1111
00:59:15,792 --> 00:59:17,814
Put your guns on the floor.

1112
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:19,928
[shouts]

1113
00:59:19,963 --> 00:59:24,264
Rick is not willing to let him
go. And he's unequivocal in this.

1114
00:59:31,875 --> 00:59:34,409
Gosh, that red-handed machete,

1115
00:59:34,444 --> 00:59:36,144
I don't ever want to
see that thing again.

1116
00:59:36,179 --> 00:59:37,890
I had nightmares about that thing.

1117
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:42,784
Rick is a ferocious
protective survivor now.

1118
00:59:42,819 --> 00:59:44,619
This is the Lord's house.

1119
00:59:44,654 --> 00:59:45,654
No.

1120
00:59:47,147 --> 00:59:49,209
It's just four walls and a roof.

1121
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:53,494
So now Bob's dying.

1122
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:57,832
And Sasha is right by his side, but
she can't bring herself to do it.

1123
00:59:57,867 --> 00:59:59,567
What's really beautiful
about that moment

1124
00:59:59,602 --> 01:00:01,469
is that Tyreese comes in the room.

1125
01:00:01,504 --> 01:00:02,937
And he says, "Let me do it."

1126
01:00:02,973 --> 01:00:06,405
As a big brother, I'm
gonna take that on.

1127
01:00:11,016 --> 01:00:14,766
So now that everything's great, we've
slaughtered everybody at Terminus.

1128
01:00:14,791 --> 01:00:18,252
We've got our food supply.
Let's get outta here.

1129
01:00:18,288 --> 01:00:20,455
No more stopping. We're going to D.C.

1130
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:23,691
Once Eugene gets to the big brains left
up there, things are gonna bounce back.

1131
01:00:23,727 --> 01:00:25,738
So our survivors are back
on the road to Washington.

1132
01:00:25,762 --> 01:00:30,832
We come up upon a vast,
just a giant herd of walkers.

1133
01:00:31,217 --> 01:00:33,209
We can get through!

1134
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:34,869
I know it!

1135
01:00:34,904 --> 01:00:36,137
Eugene realizes that,

1136
01:00:36,172 --> 01:00:39,207
because of Abraham's
stubbornness, someone is gonna die.

1137
01:00:39,242 --> 01:00:41,642
That's when he finally comes clean.

1138
01:00:41,852 --> 01:00:43,896
I lied!

1139
01:00:44,314 --> 01:00:45,839
I'm not a scientist.

1140
01:00:46,349 --> 01:00:49,784
He does not have the
cure to the apocalypse.

1141
01:00:53,189 --> 01:00:55,994
He just pulled the rug out
from under us. It was all gone.

1142
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:59,127
And everything that we
had lost was for nothing.

1143
01:01:00,563 --> 01:01:05,733
Meanwhile, we haven't seen Beth
since the midway point of Season Four.

1144
01:01:05,769 --> 01:01:10,004
She's captured by this group run by
cops. You know, it's in this hospital.

1145
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:12,280
If we hadn't saved you, you'd
be one of them right now.

1146
01:01:12,308 --> 01:01:13,975
So you owe us.

1147
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:17,223
You work for us. We'll give you what
you need. But you have to work it off.

1148
01:01:17,247 --> 01:01:19,367
They have her prisoner, and
they're not letting her leave.

1149
01:01:19,391 --> 01:01:22,517
I'm Noah. I'm outta here
when the time is right.

1150
01:01:22,552 --> 01:01:24,881
We're not trapped. I'm going with you.

1151
01:01:30,467 --> 01:01:32,994
Noah escapes from Grady Memorial

1152
01:01:33,029 --> 01:01:35,363
and comes across Daryl and Carol.

1153
01:01:35,398 --> 01:01:37,376
Is there a blonde girl
there? You see a blonde girl?

1154
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:42,098
Noah and Daryl and Carol are trying to
go on the rescue mission to find Beth.

1155
01:01:45,875 --> 01:01:48,945
Carol herself is injured
and she is taken by the cops

1156
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:50,623
and they are taken to that hospital.

1157
01:01:50,794 --> 01:01:53,047
If they don't get there soon,

1158
01:01:53,083 --> 01:01:54,668
they're not gonna be
able to get her out.

1159
01:01:54,692 --> 01:01:57,952
If we get a couple of her
cops, we do an even trade.

1160
01:01:57,987 --> 01:02:00,499
Tyreese is the voice of reason for Rick.

1161
01:02:00,524 --> 01:02:01,826
I think he realizes that

1162
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:05,693
this is a man that probably is
too gung-ho for his own good.

1163
01:02:05,728 --> 01:02:07,328
Glad we could work things out.

1164
01:02:07,363 --> 01:02:09,295
Now I just need Noah.

1165
01:02:12,802 --> 01:02:14,437
[gunshot]

1166
01:02:16,573 --> 01:02:20,541
Beth, in her final moments,
couldn't accept injustice.

1167
01:02:20,974 --> 01:02:23,966
She stood up where other
people weren't gonna stand up.

1168
01:02:23,991 --> 01:02:28,651
Daryl's like, [bleep] you. And
he just shoots her in the face.

1169
01:02:31,688 --> 01:02:36,290
When Daryl comes out of the hospital
holding Beth, he's devastated.

1170
01:02:37,216 --> 01:02:39,176
No! No!

1171
01:02:39,201 --> 01:02:41,295
To have the rest of our group show up

1172
01:02:41,331 --> 01:02:44,065
when her dead body's
being brought outside...

1173
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:47,632
It's one of the most devastating
moments to me in the whole show.

1174
01:02:48,259 --> 01:02:50,938
It was another terrible loss

1175
01:02:50,974 --> 01:02:53,841
of an innocent, beautiful spirit.

1176
01:02:57,814 --> 01:03:00,548
Per Beth's wish, Noah gets
to go back to Virginia,

1177
01:03:00,583 --> 01:03:02,884
back to his home to see
if he can find his family.

1178
01:03:02,919 --> 01:03:05,019
So they go. They take
the trip to Virginia.

1179
01:03:05,054 --> 01:03:08,022
- You don't want to go in there.
- Let me see it.

1180
01:03:12,861 --> 01:03:14,660
No!

1181
01:03:15,932 --> 01:03:16,932
No!

1182
01:03:16,966 --> 01:03:18,628
He gets bit...

1183
01:03:20,069 --> 01:03:24,619
and goes through this crazy
psychological acid trip

1184
01:03:24,644 --> 01:03:27,213
of all the people that
have died around him.

1185
01:03:27,238 --> 01:03:30,344
- It's okay, Tyreese.
- It's better now.

1186
01:03:32,749 --> 01:03:36,317
Tyreese was everything to
me. We always had each other.

1187
01:03:36,352 --> 01:03:38,052
It's devastating, to say the least.

1188
01:03:38,816 --> 01:03:40,628
After Tyreese dies and Beth dies

1189
01:03:40,657 --> 01:03:44,125
and everyone's just at their
lowest point, there's no food.

1190
01:03:44,954 --> 01:03:47,962
- How much longer we got?
- 60 miles.

1191
01:03:47,997 --> 01:03:50,171
I wasn't talking about that.

1192
01:03:51,425 --> 01:03:53,568
And then this stranger
appears who looks like

1193
01:03:53,593 --> 01:03:55,603
he's just stepped out
of some kind of catalog.

1194
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,415
He's like he's pretty clean.

1195
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,307

She and her community

It's the happy homemaker.
She's always smiling.

And she's making casseroles
and making cookies.

But anytime anybody leaves the
room, that smile disappears.

guns. And now you're here!

One morning, you'll wake up

and you won't be in your bed.

1247

She disguises it in a little fairy tale.

I wanted to punch her in the face.

Interestingly at this point, Carol and
Sam have this neat little relationship.

Why'd you steal the guns?

1258
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:12,930
Because sometimes you
need to protect yourself.

If you don't fight, you die.

confrontation with Rick very well.

Knocking Rick out was
absolutely the right move.

he needs a time out.

It's horrific and the
reason why it happened

whether they're going to keep Rick.

Pete, should we exile him?

Well, in the course of
this meeting, you know,

Rick has actually been out
fighting walkers that have entered.

There's a mistake at the
gates, walkers get inside.

coming are actually here already.

the plan to make some noise.

1365
01:13:21,956 --> 01:13:25,891

all these walkers out.

1367
01:13:29,708 --> 01:13:31,731
Daryl gets separated from us.

1368
01:13:31,766 --> 01:13:35,954
Daryl is taken prisoner by these
people that he meets in the woods.

1369
01:13:35,979 --> 01:13:37,536
One of them is named Dwight.

1370
01:13:37,572 --> 01:13:39,138
Give her the crossbow.

1371
01:13:39,173 --> 01:13:41,774
And they take his bike.
And they take his weapon.

1372
01:13:41,809 --> 01:13:43,554
And he says, you know,
you're gonna be sorry.

1373
01:13:43,578 --> 01:13:45,244
And he means it.

[grunts]

1375
01:13:52,509 --> 01:13:55,521
There's an outside threat.
And it is the Wolves.

1376
01:13:55,563 --> 01:13:56,969
The blaring horn is caused

1377
01:13:56,994 --> 01:14:00,072
by the Wolves driving
the truck into Alexandria.

1378
01:14:04,499 --> 01:14:06,399
They have no morals, no compassion.

1379
01:14:06,424 --> 01:14:08,510
They don't know how to
do anything but kill.

1380
01:14:08,535 --> 01:14:11,090
Carol puts the wolf mask on.

1381
01:14:11,115 --> 01:14:13,016
Carol, once again, bam, bam, bam.

1382
01:14:16,298 --> 01:14:17,675
Leave.

1383
01:14:21,849 --> 01:14:25,217
Carol learns that Morgan isn't killing.

1384
01:14:25,253 --> 01:14:28,074
- You don't have to kill people.
- Of course, we do.

1385
01:14:28,099 --> 01:14:31,857
Morgan is trying to live by the
code of "all life is precious."

1386
01:14:31,893 --> 01:14:34,858
Get the hell out of here
and you don't ever come back.

1387
01:14:35,763 --> 01:14:38,550
You keep choosing this
life, you will die.

1388
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:44,211
And at this particular point,

1389
01:14:44,236 --> 01:14:48,083
the whole of Alexandria is
surrounded by walkers from the quarry.

1390
01:14:48,187 --> 01:14:51,687
After the Wolves attack,
the tower was unstable.

1391
01:14:54,884 --> 01:14:58,050
Walkers spill in and
they're just screwed.

Deanna saves Rick and
gets bit in the process.

And, damn it, she knows what that means.

1396
01:15:09,864 --> 01:15:13,703
I ran over to help
because you are one of us.

1397
01:15:15,547 --> 01:15:17,870
They're in the house.
They're making noise.

01:15:17,905 --> 01:15:19,484
More are coming.

1399
01:15:19,509 --> 01:15:22,074
At that point, we're
trapped inside of the house.

1400
01:15:22,117 --> 01:15:25,957
They realize that they have to
reignite the walker guts plan.

1401
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:31,784
The meat poncho. My least
favorite wardrobe I've ever had.

1403
01:15:38,552 --> 01:15:40,425
Sam's desperately trying
to keep it together.

1404
01:15:40,482 --> 01:15:43,505
He freezes and he can't move.

1405
01:15:43,998 --> 01:15:45,802
Sam, just look at Mom.

1406
01:15:46,666 --> 01:15:47,921
Mommy!

1407
01:15:50,997 --> 01:15:52,260
He's screaming "Mommy"

His mother get eaten.

1414

His father's been killed by this guy.

1419
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:25,311
Rick takes him to the infirmary

1420
01:16:25,346 --> 01:16:27,479
and begs for his boy to live.

1421
01:16:27,515 --> 01:16:28,849
Please.

1422
01:16:29,583 --> 01:16:32,384
Rick is unable to just
sit there and watch.

1423
01:16:40,795 --> 01:16:44,244
Right as Maggie's on top of the tower
and about to get toppled by walkers,

1424
01:16:44,269 --> 01:16:45,705
Glenn shows up.

1425
01:16:46,243 --> 01:16:47,402
No.

Glenn was actually alive.
He looked super dead.

1427
01:16:52,304 --> 01:16:54,907
It turns out it's Nicholas's
body who shielded him.

1428
01:16:55,192 --> 01:16:57,724
He made it out because
he's a resourceful dude.

1429
01:16:57,749 --> 01:17:01,347
Glenn sees chaos inside
the walls of Alexandria.

1430
01:17:01,738 --> 01:17:05,551
When he breaks in, he finds Maggie
trapped on top of the guard tower.

1431
01:17:05,817 --> 01:17:08,533
He sees Maggie in peril.
This is the woman he loves.

01:17:08,558 --> 01:17:10,300
This is somebody he's
been very worried about.

She's pregnant, they're going to
have a child together eventually.

01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,793
Just go! Just get over!

1435
01:17:14,829 --> 01:17:17,396
Glenn is about to get
swarmed and killed.

There's a giant explosion in the pond.

The walkers, they're drawn to fire.

1446
01:17:45,359 --> 01:17:46,792
It was hot.

I thought my eyebrows were burned off.

There's Daryl. He doesn't
need his crossbow anymore.

Our little good friend, Jesus, catches
us in the act, or just after the act.

Jesus tells him that
he is from the Hilltop.

They mention this guy, Negan.

We had a deal.

1488
01:20:05,498 --> 01:20:09,650
As far as Jesus knows, Negan is the head
of a group of people called the Saviors.

1489
01:20:09,705 --> 01:20:12,536
And they're running a protection racket.

1490
01:20:12,572 --> 01:20:16,507
So they show up. They kill a kid
and you give 'em half of everything?

These dicks just got a good story.

Alexandria is in dire

The deal that Maggie initiates
is they'll take out Negan

for half of everything they have.

1496
01:20:29,954 --> 01:20:33,221
It's not a huge stretch for the Hilltop
to do that and give them the food.

to do in their minds.

one of them was Negan.

more floating around,

feeling at this point

that we pretty much killed the threat.

01:22:17,212 --> 01:22:18,799
Yeah, you probably should have.

1536
01:22:18,824 --> 01:22:20,712
A firefight ensues after that.

1537
01:22:24,263 --> 01:22:26,597
Several of the group
members go after Dwight.

1538
01:22:28,067 --> 01:22:29,871
Hi, Daryl.

1539
01:22:30,093 --> 01:22:34,348
They all get captured.
Rosita, Daryl, Michonne.

1540
01:22:34,373 --> 01:22:37,141
Back in Alexandria, something is wrong.

1541
01:22:37,176 --> 01:22:39,810
- Oh!
- Maggie!

1542
01:22:39,845 --> 01:22:41,678
We know that Maggie's pregnant.

1543
01:22:41,714 --> 01:22:43,358
There's a complication
with the pregnancy,

1544
01:22:43,382 --> 01:22:45,516
but the Hilltop has the obstetrician.

1545
01:22:45,551 --> 01:22:48,269
We have to get Maggie
there. And we go as a group.

1546
01:22:48,294 --> 01:22:50,487
Good call on the transport.

1547
01:22:55,692 --> 01:22:58,367
What if it's the last
day on earth for you?

1548
01:22:58,392 --> 01:23:01,383
We start to get blocked at every turn.

1549
01:23:02,907 --> 01:23:06,027
They're not only being blocked,
but they're being messed with.

1550
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:07,271
[gunfire]

1551
01:23:07,306 --> 01:23:09,940
Get back to the RV. Go!

1552
01:23:10,456 --> 01:23:12,810
There's just too many people.

1553
01:23:12,845 --> 01:23:14,512
This is too well orchestrated.

1554
01:23:14,537 --> 01:23:16,814
This is a much more brutal,

1555
01:23:16,849 --> 01:23:20,202
terrifying outfit than he
could have ever imagined.

1556
01:23:20,227 --> 01:23:21,426
[screams]

1557
01:23:23,989 --> 01:23:26,056
So, Eugene has the great idea.

1558
01:23:26,092 --> 01:23:29,359
I'll drive the RV and
you guys take Maggie

1559
01:23:29,395 --> 01:23:31,929
through the woods this way
and we'll meet up around here.

1560
01:23:32,490 --> 01:23:35,299
But the Saviors are not fooled by that.

1561
01:23:35,334 --> 01:23:37,801
And now they have us on foot.

1562
01:23:38,161 --> 01:23:42,172
Rick and the others literally
carry Maggie on the stretcher.

1563
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:44,007
[whistling]

1564
01:23:44,416 --> 01:23:46,169
Go! Go!

1565
01:23:47,362 --> 01:23:51,323
We walk straight into
Negan and his crew.

1566
01:23:51,684 --> 01:23:52,916
[shrieking]

1567
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:01,697
And they see the RV there.

1568
01:24:01,722 --> 01:24:05,159
They see Eugene there
kneeling, beaten, bloodied.

1569
01:24:05,429 --> 01:24:07,464
Daryl comes out of the van.

1570
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:09,211
And he's bleeding and
he's half dead already.

1571
01:24:09,235 --> 01:24:12,019
Let's get her down and
get y'all on your knees.

1572
01:24:12,044 --> 01:24:15,072
You've never seen these
people submit to anybody.

1573
01:24:15,107 --> 01:24:18,204
You've never seen them be as
powerless as they are right now.

1574
01:24:18,229 --> 01:24:20,651
We know our group has
screwed with the wrong guy.

1575
01:24:20,676 --> 01:24:22,927
There's this dude named Negan.

1576
01:24:24,817 --> 01:24:27,253
This is the man who's
in charge of the Saviors.

1577
01:24:27,278 --> 01:24:29,319
And he's pretty pissed off.

1578
01:24:29,355 --> 01:24:33,624
He comes out and just plays with
us like a cat with a little mouse.

1579
01:24:33,659 --> 01:24:37,728
He is really sadistic and messed up.

1580
01:24:37,763 --> 01:24:39,997
Negan's weapon of choice is Lucille

1581
01:24:40,032 --> 01:24:44,168
which is a baseball bat
lovingly draped in barbed wire.

1582
01:24:44,203 --> 01:24:46,370
Negan's rules are
pretty straightforward.

1583
01:24:46,405 --> 01:24:48,681
You will give me half your [bleep].

1584
01:24:48,706 --> 01:24:50,126
We kill you one of you as an example.

1585
01:24:50,150 --> 01:24:52,854
And if you don't listen to
us, we'll kill more of you.

1586
01:24:52,878 --> 01:24:56,013
Negan comes out and says
one of you guys are dead.

1587
01:24:56,048 --> 01:24:58,274
He is going to beat one of us to death.

1588
01:24:58,362 --> 01:25:00,117
Stop it!

1589
01:25:00,604 --> 01:25:03,497
Rick has no idea who he's dealing with.

1590
01:25:05,558 --> 01:25:09,660
I think this is the first
time Rick is truly powerless.

1591
01:25:12,188 --> 01:25:15,116
He's feeling completely
inferior to Negan.

1592
01:25:15,141 --> 01:25:17,830
All of their control is taken away.

1593
01:25:18,437 --> 01:25:20,005
I don't think anybody
who's sitting there

1594
01:25:20,029 --> 01:25:22,377
thinks there's any
way out of that at all.

1595
01:25:23,379 --> 01:25:26,506
They're gonna have to learn to live
by Negan's rules from here on out.

1596
01:25:26,531 --> 01:25:28,845
And if they don't like
it, they're gonna die.

1597
01:25:28,881 --> 01:25:32,583
You see Rick getting more and
more panicked and terrified.

1598
01:25:32,618 --> 01:25:34,947
It is that sort of moment
where loss is imminent.

1599
01:25:34,972 --> 01:25:36,738
And you don't know who and how.

1600
01:25:37,056 --> 01:25:40,655
This is the start of something
much bigger, much scarier.

1601
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:42,465
And there will be much more loss

1602
01:25:42,490 --> 01:25:45,062
than what they've ever
encountered before.

1603
01:25:49,594 --> 01:25:50,560
This moment...

1604
01:25:50,595 --> 01:25:51,994
[screaming]

1605
01:25:52,030 --> 01:25:55,665
changes absolutely
everything moving forward.

1606
01:25:56,367 --> 01:26:00,937
I think that the audience needs to
not watch the returning episode alone.

1607
01:26:00,972 --> 01:26:04,006
Be with your loved ones and
hold hands. And make a nice meal.

1608
01:26:04,597 --> 01:26:07,822
Really say nice things to each other,
and tell them that you love them

1609
01:26:07,846 --> 01:26:10,378
before you embark on
this returning episode.

1610
01:26:10,402 --> 01:26:11,402
Thank you, man.

1611
01:26:11,910 --> 01:26:13,776
- Jesus!
- Oops, I got to go.

1612
01:26:13,778 --> 01:26:15,377
- We've got everything?
- Thank you, guys.

1613
01:26:15,401 --> 01:26:16,876
- Cool.
- You're welcome.
