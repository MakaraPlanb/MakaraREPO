That's us, that's the Hilltop.

3
00:00:06,281 --> 00:00:07,597
As soon as the walls were built,

4
00:00:07,683 --> 00:00:08,765
the Saviors showed up.

5
00:00:08,851 --> 00:00:10,684
If we go kill Negan,
take out his boys,

6
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:12,152
will you hook us up?

are you doing here?

00:00:19,244 --> 00:00:20,244
What am I supposed to do?

10
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:22,162
You're supposed to
be someone else!

Lower your gun.

We've got a Carol and a Maggie.

14

- Damn it, Maggie, let's go!

25
00:01:07,843 --> 00:01:09,893

Nice jacket.

30
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,601
For a murderous bitch.

31
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:32,001

off her before we shoot her.

can feel it. It ain't stopping.

Woman #2: I'm getting it tighter.
Jesus, give me a second.

cutting off my circulation.

it's supposed to.

It's Primo.

Damn it, they've got him.
Give me the walkie.

Babe, what's happening?

43

(static hissing)

44
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,383
Lower your gun, prick.

45
00:02:15,753 --> 00:02:19,087
You, with the Colt Python.

46
00:02:19,089 --> 00:02:21,890

Woman:
Eight in sight.

52
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:39,591
Too many.

53
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:41,927
No, we can take 'em.
We took more.

54
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:48,150
- (static hisses)
- We're not coming out, but we will talk.

55

Names.

Names!

57
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:54,072
I'm Maggie, she's Carol.

58

Carol and a Maggie.

00:02:56,527 --> 00:02:59,494
I'm thinking that's something
you want to chat about.

60
00:03:01,532 --> 00:03:04,116
Now, we're gonna work
this out right now,

You can see we have
one of yours.

65
00:03:18,182 --> 00:03:19,798
We'll trade.

66
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,134
- (static hisses)
- I'm listening.

67
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:24,386
Rick on radio: First I want
to talk to Maggie and Carol,

68
00:03:24,388 --> 00:03:26,805
- make sure they're all right.
- (walker growling)

69
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,490
I'm gonna put you on.
You say you're fine.

70
00:03:28,492 --> 00:03:30,359
I'll know if you try
anything else.

71
00:03:30,361 --> 00:03:32,944
Rick, it's Carol.

72
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,147
- I'm... I'm fine, but...
- (scoffs) Now you.

73
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:36,982
Rick, it's Maggie.
We're both okay.

74
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:38,867
- We'll figure thi...
- Shut up.

75
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:40,869
Woman: You have your proof.
Let's talk.

76
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:45,073
Rick: All right.
This is the deal right here.

77
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:49,411
Let 'em go, you can have
your guy back and live.

78
00:03:49,413 --> 00:03:52,214
Two for one,
that's not much of a trade.

79
00:03:52,216 --> 00:03:55,217
Rick: You don't
have another choice

80
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:57,502
or you would've done
something about it already.

81
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:01,590
We have to get him back.

82
00:04:01,592 --> 00:04:03,508
Primo can take care of himself.

83
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,594
He can patch me up.

84
00:04:05,596 --> 00:04:07,996
I need him,
thanks to that bitch.

85
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,767
You lost your balls, Paula.

86
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:13,985
You should've shot her in the
head so they could hear her die.

87
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,321
If you could just shut up,
I'll solve this.

88
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:17,489
Then make the deal or we go in.

89
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,524
She said shut up, so shut it.

90
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,076
You should be glad
she doesn't have

91
00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:23,612
a sack of gonads to trip over.

92
00:04:23,614 --> 00:04:26,081
- (static hisses)
- Rick: Look, I know you're talking it over.

93
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,816
It's a fair trade.

94
00:04:27,818 --> 00:04:31,553
Just come out, we do this,

95
00:04:31,555 --> 00:04:33,722
we all walk away.

96
00:04:33,724 --> 00:04:36,041
Smug prick.

97
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:38,043
He must think we're stupid.

98
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:39,878
- That's a good thing.

99

Paula: We're headed
to the break point.

119
00:06:18,404 --> 00:06:21,005
Switch to Theta channel,
same code.

120
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:23,274
If I'm not there,
toggle to Alpha, listen in.

- Safe house.

Get on the ground.

You there.

132
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,783
You, over there.

133
00:07:27,574 --> 00:07:30,308
You're wondering if there's
a way out of this.

134
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,394
There isn't.
Not unless I say so.

I want to kill you both
right now.

139
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,086
It's taking all I have not to,

140
00:07:59,088 --> 00:08:00,838
so go ahead, I dare you,
try something.

141
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,440

anyone checked this place?

Woman #3: It was
fine a month ago.

153
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:28,726
Woman #2: Sweetie, that was a month ago.
Shit hards quick.

154
00:09:28,728 --> 00:09:31,312
The guns have gone bye-bye,
the food's gone bye-bye,

155
00:09:31,314 --> 00:09:33,798
and we got growlers
up and down the halls.

156
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,816
- (Carol panting)
- Man: Means people can get through, too.

157
00:09:35,818 --> 00:09:37,652
- Maybe we should get gone.
- (muffled) Carol!

158
00:09:37,654 --> 00:09:39,020
- Woman #3: Yeah? Where the hell to?
- Nowhere.

159
00:09:39,022 --> 00:09:41,105
Got dead in the halls?
Free security.

160
00:09:41,107 --> 00:09:43,524
Those assholes get here
before our people,

161
00:09:43,526 --> 00:09:45,443
the cold bloods
will buy us some time.

162
00:09:45,445 --> 00:09:47,528
- (panting continues)
- Shut up.

163
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,664
Jesus, it's bleeding. It's not
supposed to keep bleeding.

164
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,333
- Molly, give me the rope.
- Man: I'm not losing it.

165
00:09:52,335 --> 00:09:54,952
- I'm not.
- Woman #3: So you grind it out. Jesus, Donnie.

166
00:09:54,954 --> 00:09:58,055
Donnie: Screw you, 'Chelle!
We have to get him back.

167
00:09:58,057 --> 00:10:00,007
He can fix it.

168
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:02,126
- We have to, Paula.
- No.

169
00:10:02,128 --> 00:10:04,095
I saw them, you didn't.

170
00:10:04,097 --> 00:10:05,563
They took the place down,

171
00:10:05,565 --> 00:10:07,214
they got the guns,
they'll kill us, too.

172
00:10:07,216 --> 00:10:08,799
(Maggie, muffled)
Hey!

173
00:10:08,801 --> 00:10:10,001
I'm not going down like that,

174
00:10:10,003 --> 00:10:11,719
not after making it this far.

175
00:10:11,721 --> 00:10:13,404
(muffled)

176
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:15,690
- Maggie: Hey!
- (Carol panting)

177
00:10:18,411 --> 00:10:20,528
What?

178
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,481
She's hyperventilating. Somebody
needs to take her gag off.

179
00:10:24,951 --> 00:10:26,817
(hyperventilating)

180
00:10:30,823 --> 00:10:33,824
She's a nervous
little bird, ain't she?

181
00:10:35,294 --> 00:10:37,044
(inhales, panting)

182
00:10:37,046 --> 00:10:38,662
(hammer clicks)

183
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,000
Look at you.

184
00:10:43,002 --> 00:10:45,086
Bitch, how did you
make it this far?

185
00:10:45,088 --> 00:10:50,007
Honey, you need to take some yoga
breaths and calm your ass down.

186
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:52,009
(panting)
I can't...

187
00:10:57,734 --> 00:11:00,317
(panting continues)

188
00:11:05,358 --> 00:11:06,724
Molly:
Oh.

189
00:11:07,706 --> 00:11:10,294
You're one of those.

190
00:11:18,838 --> 00:11:21,589
(Carol wheezing)

191
00:11:25,128 --> 00:11:27,461
What are you so afraid of?

192
00:11:32,602 --> 00:11:35,302
Are you actually afraid to die?

193
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:38,606
(scoffs)

194
00:11:38,608 --> 00:11:43,094
All this and you're scared
of getting your ticket punched.

195
00:11:46,482 --> 00:11:49,366
It doesn't matter
what happens to me.

196
00:11:51,571 --> 00:11:54,572
Just don't hurt Maggie.

197
00:11:54,574 --> 00:11:56,507
Don't hurt the baby.

198
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,420
Yeah, right.

199
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,008
Donnie: She got a bun in the
oven, she doesn't look it.

200
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:16,760
I'm only two months, I think.

201
00:12:18,264 --> 00:12:19,930
You're some kind of stupid,

202
00:12:19,932 --> 00:12:22,183
getting knocked up
at a time like this.

203
00:12:22,185 --> 00:12:24,768
You think that's funny?

204
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:28,272
When was it ever smart
to get knocked up?

205
00:12:28,274 --> 00:12:31,492
Women used to just die
in childbirth.

206
00:12:31,494 --> 00:12:33,777
And they always thought
the world was gonna end.

207
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:36,780
Living through it,
why would you just give up?

208
00:12:36,782 --> 00:12:39,583
But are you gonna
live through it?

209
00:12:41,504 --> 00:12:44,205
Anyway, that's cute.

210
00:12:44,207 --> 00:12:46,707
Babies are the point.

211
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:49,059
Children are our future.

212
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,131
Making bite-size snacks
for the dead.

213
00:12:56,469 --> 00:12:59,019
The point is to stay standing.

214
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:00,304
No.

215
00:13:00,306 --> 00:13:04,058
Walkers do that.

216
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,477
I'm choosing something.

217
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,314
That's right.

218
00:13:10,316 --> 00:13:12,366
You are.

219
00:13:12,368 --> 00:13:14,351
You did.

220
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:22,459
(Donnie groaning)

221
00:13:32,505 --> 00:13:34,889
(coughing)

222
00:13:37,176 --> 00:13:39,343
The baby.

223
00:13:41,063 --> 00:13:44,398
(laughing)

224
00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:50,688
Honey, in case
you haven't noticed,

225
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:54,425
you've got bigger problems
than a little secondhand smoke.

226
00:13:56,429 --> 00:13:58,596
Molls.

227
00:14:05,037 --> 00:14:06,837
Y'all are worse than a bunch

228
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,708
of evangelical second graders.

229
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,260
(coughing)

230
00:14:13,262 --> 00:14:15,446
(hacking)

231
00:14:22,555 --> 00:14:25,556
Those things'll kill you.

232
00:14:25,558 --> 00:14:27,725
They already have.

233
00:14:27,727 --> 00:14:31,478
I'm a dead woman walking.

234
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,983
Which puts us
in exactly the same boat.

235
00:14:35,985 --> 00:14:39,286
(laughs, coughing)

236
00:14:40,873 --> 00:14:43,123
(coughing continues)

237
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,629
Ah!
(groaning)

238
00:14:53,186 --> 00:14:55,203
My arm feels like it's on fire.

239
00:14:55,205 --> 00:14:58,022
You pull that off, you gonna
be nothing but a spigot.

240
00:14:58,024 --> 00:15:00,374
- Okay, hold on.
- Agh!

241
00:15:00,376 --> 00:15:04,011
Scout crew is coming. They're
30 minutes out, maybe less.

242
00:15:04,013 --> 00:15:06,631
Maggie:
He doesn't have 30 minutes.

243
00:15:06,633 --> 00:15:09,383
His nerves are dying.

244
00:15:09,385 --> 00:15:11,853
If he doesn't get medical help,
he's gonna lose his arm,

245
00:15:11,855 --> 00:15:15,139
maybe his life.

246
00:15:15,141 --> 00:15:18,392
I'm not a doctor, but my dad lost
his leg, and I know that much.

247
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:26,868
Your man, Primo,
you think he can help you?

248
00:15:29,989 --> 00:15:32,406
It's time to end this.

249
00:15:32,408 --> 00:15:34,542
Talk to Rick.

250
00:15:37,463 --> 00:15:39,330
30 minutes.

251
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:56,180
You know my problem?
(panting)

252
00:16:01,487 --> 00:16:04,405
She did this to me.

253
00:16:04,407 --> 00:16:06,190
She did it and she's just
sitting there

254
00:16:06,192 --> 00:16:08,192
right as rain, fully intact.

255
00:16:08,194 --> 00:16:11,612
- Paula: Hey.
- No, you're not gonna make the trade.

256
00:16:11,614 --> 00:16:13,197
And we just do 'em both now.

257
00:16:15,868 --> 00:16:17,635
Paula: No, we wait
for the others.

258
00:16:17,637 --> 00:16:20,871
We have to be smart.
We need insurance.

259
00:16:20,873 --> 00:16:22,206
Then shoot her in the arm, too.

260
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,508
(chuckles)
No.

261
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:28,512
You really gonna stick up for
some gutless bitch over me?

262
00:16:31,884 --> 00:16:35,303
- God damn it!
- Paula: Shut up.

263
00:16:35,305 --> 00:16:37,271
Donnie:
Don't push me, Paula.

264
00:16:37,273 --> 00:16:39,657
- (Donnie groans)
- Paula: Shut up!

265
00:16:46,115 --> 00:16:47,481
Leave her alone!

266
00:16:50,603 --> 00:16:53,154
No! No!

267
00:16:53,156 --> 00:16:54,905
(screams)

268
00:16:54,907 --> 00:16:57,158
You dumb, uppity bitch!

269
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,281
(grunting)

270
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:06,784
(thuds)

271
00:17:11,257 --> 00:17:14,308
You really are
some kind of stupid.

272
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:19,814
Take her out.
See if she knows anything.

273
00:17:19,816 --> 00:17:22,183
Should've done that before.

274
00:17:28,174 --> 00:17:29,991
Move.

275
00:17:31,444 --> 00:17:34,045
- (walkers growling)
- (door slams)

276
00:17:39,118 --> 00:17:41,702
(growling)

277
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,543
You got nice clothes,

278
00:17:49,545 --> 00:17:53,047
time to make babies.

279
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:55,466
You're holed up somewhere good.

280
00:17:56,469 --> 00:17:57,718
Tell me where.

281
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,970
(gags)

282
00:18:03,226 --> 00:18:06,577
(retches)

283
00:18:15,655 --> 00:18:17,488
Don't draw this out, bitch.

284
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:21,075
Just tell me where.

285
00:18:21,077 --> 00:18:24,161
Help yourself
and the baby in your belly.

286
00:18:25,665 --> 00:18:29,333
The way you stay alive
is you produce for us.

287
00:18:33,756 --> 00:18:36,006
You're not the good guys.

288
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,427
You should know that.

289
00:18:42,598 --> 00:18:44,281
Molly:
He got you good, kid.

290
00:18:44,283 --> 00:18:46,267
He's in pain.

291
00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:48,519
Guys can't handle pain.

292
00:18:51,774 --> 00:18:54,191
- Carol: Excuse me?
- (Paula sighs)

293
00:18:56,729 --> 00:18:59,196
Just wanted to say thank you

294
00:18:59,198 --> 00:19:02,733
for helping Maggie,
for helping me.

295
00:19:05,571 --> 00:19:07,204
My husband Ed,
he used to...

296
00:19:07,206 --> 00:19:09,707
Yeah? I don't care
if your old man

297
00:19:09,709 --> 00:19:11,876
used to ring your bell.

298
00:19:11,878 --> 00:19:16,380
I see exactly
who you are, Carol.

299
00:19:18,184 --> 00:19:20,384
I know.

300
00:19:20,386 --> 00:19:22,219
You're pathetic.

301
00:19:22,221 --> 00:19:25,122
You wanna think
we're just the same?

302
00:19:25,124 --> 00:19:26,357
Go ahead.

303
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:28,826
You're wrong.

304
00:19:28,828 --> 00:19:32,129
He's just a warm body
for my bed.

305
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:35,833
That's it. I could
kill him in his sleep.

306
00:19:46,913 --> 00:19:48,913
(chuckles)

307
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,084
Do you really believe
in that crap?

308
00:20:00,193 --> 00:20:02,977
My faith got me through
the death of my daughter.

309
00:20:02,979 --> 00:20:04,995
Hmm.

310
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:08,165
Well, the good news is maybe
you'll see her again soon.

311
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:14,155
('Chelle wincing)

312
00:20:16,826 --> 00:20:18,492
Maggie:
What happened?

313
00:20:20,696 --> 00:20:23,113
I stole something.
Got caught.

314
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,951
What?

315
00:20:26,953 --> 00:20:30,187
Gas, from this place.

316
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:32,056
- Why?
- To get a new car.

317
00:20:32,058 --> 00:20:34,225
Look for my boyfriend's body.

318
00:20:36,696 --> 00:20:38,329
Did you find him?

319
00:20:38,331 --> 00:20:40,898
He was blown up.

320
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,234
Not much to find.

321
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,974
"Frankie."

322
00:20:49,976 --> 00:20:52,977
- Was that his name?
- Hell, no.

323
00:20:52,979 --> 00:20:56,730
I barely knew him.

324
00:20:56,732 --> 00:20:58,516
He was a dick.

325
00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:06,023
Frank was my dad.

326
00:21:08,761 --> 00:21:11,161
And that's what I was
gonna name the baby.

327
00:21:16,385 --> 00:21:19,220
- I'm sorry.
- No.

328
00:21:22,842 --> 00:21:25,175
You aren't.

329
00:21:25,177 --> 00:21:27,511
I'm not planning to die today.

330
00:21:27,513 --> 00:21:30,564
Yeah, me neither.

331
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:35,519
Thing is, one of us is wrong.

332
00:21:39,992 --> 00:21:42,693
Just tell me where.

333
00:21:51,037 --> 00:21:52,953
(sighs)

334
00:21:55,786 --> 00:21:58,281
Rick on radio:
Have you thought about it?

335
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:00,406
Talk to me.

336
00:22:00,408 --> 00:22:03,276
(walkers growling)

337
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:05,862
- (static hissing)
- You weren't listening.

338
00:22:05,864 --> 00:22:08,364
I said I'd contact you.

339
00:22:08,366 --> 00:22:10,199
- (static hissing)
- Rick: Would it make a difference

340
00:22:10,201 --> 00:22:12,368
if I said I was sorry
about that?

341
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,754
What do you think?

342
00:22:14,756 --> 00:22:17,924
- (static hissing)
- I think we're gonna make the trade,

343
00:22:17,926 --> 00:22:19,542
so tell me where.

344
00:22:22,213 --> 00:22:24,430
We haven't agreed to that.

345
00:22:24,432 --> 00:22:27,600
- (static hissing)
- Rick: You will.

346
00:22:27,602 --> 00:22:30,720
You know what?
I'm not so sure.

347
00:22:32,056 --> 00:22:34,440
We'd be taking most of the risk,

348
00:22:34,442 --> 00:22:37,226
not getting much
in the way of a reward.

349
00:22:37,228 --> 00:22:41,781
- (static hissing)
- Rick: The other option won't work out for you.

350
00:22:45,069 --> 00:22:47,954
We'll take our chances.

351
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,748
(sighs) You don't
have to do this.

352
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,082
You don't have to fight.

353
00:23:00,084 --> 00:23:03,419
Your people killed
all of my people.

354
00:23:03,421 --> 00:23:04,754
Of course we gotta fight.

355
00:23:04,756 --> 00:23:08,291
- We didn't want to.
- But you did.

356
00:23:08,293 --> 00:23:10,459
So tell me why.

357
00:23:13,147 --> 00:23:16,315
Your people ambushed
my people on the road,

358
00:23:16,317 --> 00:23:18,434
tried to take everything we had.

359
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,690
They were gonna kill them.

360
00:23:24,692 --> 00:23:27,493
Well, damn.

361
00:23:27,495 --> 00:23:30,863
So now we know what
happened to T's group.

362
00:23:32,033 --> 00:23:34,867
Those idiots.

363
00:23:34,869 --> 00:23:36,953
Probably put on a big show.

364
00:23:36,955 --> 00:23:41,374
Okay, fair play.

365
00:23:41,376 --> 00:23:43,960
You were just
defending yourselves.

366
00:23:46,547 --> 00:23:51,434
But, see, your people killed
them on the road, right?

367
00:23:51,436 --> 00:23:54,687
Blew them to pieces.

368
00:23:54,689 --> 00:23:56,889
So, why not stop?

369
00:24:01,729 --> 00:24:04,313
They said they were
working for Negan.

370
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:08,317
And what do you think
you know about Negan?

371
00:24:10,405 --> 00:24:12,538
He sounded like a maniac.

372
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,206
We were scared.
We had to stop him.

373
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:17,293
Sweetie, sweetie.

374
00:24:17,295 --> 00:24:19,996
We are all Negan.

375
00:24:23,051 --> 00:24:26,719
- What do you mean?
- (Molly coughing)

376
00:24:29,424 --> 00:24:31,841
What does that mean?

377
00:24:31,843 --> 00:24:35,478
(coughing)

378
00:24:46,391 --> 00:24:49,358
(walkers growling faintly)

379
00:24:53,614 --> 00:24:55,364
Can I have one?

380
00:24:56,534 --> 00:24:59,618
Well, look at you, little bird.

381
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,755
I didn't think you approved.

382
00:25:02,757 --> 00:25:04,924
I don't.

383
00:25:15,803 --> 00:25:17,153
(lighter clicks)

384
00:25:27,281 --> 00:25:29,648
You are weak.

385
00:25:30,818 --> 00:25:33,152
What are you so afraid of?

386
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,624
So scared, you can't even
stick to your own principles.

387
00:25:41,746 --> 00:25:44,964
You don't want me to stick
to my own principles.

388
00:25:54,392 --> 00:25:58,260
I was a secretary before.

389
00:26:01,933 --> 00:26:04,817
I fetched coffee for my boss

390
00:26:04,819 --> 00:26:07,653
and made him feel
good about himself.

391
00:26:07,655 --> 00:26:09,939
I spent most of my days reading

392
00:26:09,941 --> 00:26:12,525
stupid inspirational
e-mails

393
00:26:12,527 --> 00:26:15,161
to try and feel good
about myself.

394
00:26:15,163 --> 00:26:18,531
There was this one
that kept going around.

395
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:21,784
A young woman
was having a hard time

396
00:26:21,786 --> 00:26:24,670
and told her mom
she wanted to give up,

397
00:26:24,672 --> 00:26:26,505
so her mom went to the kitchen

398
00:26:26,507 --> 00:26:29,925
and started boiling
three pots of water.

399
00:26:29,927 --> 00:26:32,461
She put a carrot in one,
an egg in another,

400
00:26:32,463 --> 00:26:34,964
and ground coffee beans
in the last one.

401
00:26:36,467 --> 00:26:38,634
After they had boiled
a while, her mom said,

402
00:26:38,636 --> 00:26:42,221
"Look, all three things went
through the same boiling water.

403
00:26:42,223 --> 00:26:45,741
The carrot went in strong
and came out soft.

404
00:26:45,743 --> 00:26:48,978
The egg was fragile
and came out hard.

405
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:53,065
But the coffee beans
changed the water itself."

406
00:26:56,737 --> 00:26:59,488
You're supposed to want
to be the coffee beans.

407
00:27:02,827 --> 00:27:05,394
See, to me, coffee
was just a thing

408
00:27:05,396 --> 00:27:07,163
that my boss would drink up.

409
00:27:07,165 --> 00:27:09,231
No matter how many times
I refilled his damn cup,

410
00:27:09,233 --> 00:27:12,034
it was just never enough.

411
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,341
I was at work when
the Army took over DC.

412
00:27:20,678 --> 00:27:22,595
We weren't allowed to leave.

413
00:27:22,597 --> 00:27:26,215
They had to evacuate all the
important people first...

414
00:27:26,217 --> 00:27:30,102
members of Congress,
government employees.

415
00:27:30,104 --> 00:27:33,022
So I was stuck with my boss.

416
00:27:33,024 --> 00:27:35,441
Not my family...

417
00:27:35,443 --> 00:27:40,246
my husband, my four girls...

418
00:27:45,203 --> 00:27:47,453
(sniffles)

419
00:27:51,592 --> 00:27:54,109
My boss was weak and stupid
and he was going to die

420
00:27:54,111 --> 00:27:56,612
and he was going
to take me down, too.

421
00:27:56,614 --> 00:27:59,465
He was the first person I killed

422
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:01,483
so that I could live.

423
00:28:03,938 --> 00:28:06,055
I stopped counting
when I hit double digits.

424
00:28:06,057 --> 00:28:09,058
That's right around the time
I stopped feeling bad about it.

425
00:28:11,062 --> 00:28:13,279
I am not like you.

426
00:28:14,732 --> 00:28:18,284
I'm still me, but better.

427
00:28:18,286 --> 00:28:21,620
I lost everything
and it made me stronger.

428
00:28:21,622 --> 00:28:23,489
You sure about that?

429
00:28:23,491 --> 00:28:25,291
I'm alive.

430
00:28:25,293 --> 00:28:27,743
With those people,
those killers.

431
00:28:27,745 --> 00:28:29,745
Your people are killers, Carol.

432
00:28:29,747 --> 00:28:32,798
That makes you a killer.

433
00:28:45,763 --> 00:28:47,846
You... you're the one.

434
00:28:47,848 --> 00:28:49,798
Excuse me?

435
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,484
You're the one
who's afraid to die.

436
00:28:52,486 --> 00:28:55,271
And you're going to.

437
00:28:55,273 --> 00:28:58,774
You will die.

438
00:29:00,566 --> 00:29:03,329
It's what's gonna happen
if you don't work this out.

439
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,450
Are you going to kill me?

440
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:13,339
I hope not.

441
00:29:19,923 --> 00:29:24,693
- (static hissing)
- Asshole, are you there?

442
00:29:24,695 --> 00:29:26,695
Rick on radio:
I'm here.

443
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,451
We've thought about it.
We want to make the trade.

444
00:29:32,453 --> 00:29:34,870
Rick:
That's good.

445
00:29:34,872 --> 00:29:38,624
There's a large field with a
sign that says "God is dead"

446
00:29:38,626 --> 00:29:41,911
about two miles
down I-66.

447
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:44,630
Good visibility
in all directions.

448
00:29:44,632 --> 00:29:47,600
Rick: We'll meet you there.
10 minutes?

449
00:29:48,803 --> 00:29:50,219
10 minutes.

450
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:57,393
Mm-mm.
Now, that was too easy.

451
00:29:57,395 --> 00:30:00,062
Maybe they're just itching
to get their people back.

452
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:02,064
Paula: No, there was no static.
There should've been static.

453
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:04,116
They're close.
They're probably already here.

454
00:30:04,118 --> 00:30:05,818
We were careful,
but there were tracks.

455
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,403
- There had to be.
- No...

456
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:09,238
They killed everybody back home.
They have the weapons.

457
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,623
They know what they're doing.

458
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:12,458
They're probably
waiting to kill us

459
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,959
as soon as we walk
out those doors.

460
00:30:13,961 --> 00:30:16,245
- That's what we'd do.
- Carol: No.

461
00:30:18,966 --> 00:30:22,001
You have to listen
to me, please.

462
00:30:22,003 --> 00:30:24,837
Rick is a man of his word.

463
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:27,756
He wouldn't put me and
Maggie at risk to attack.

464
00:30:27,758 --> 00:30:30,926
Then he's just
as stupid as you are.

465
00:30:30,928 --> 00:30:32,761
(knob clicking)

466
00:30:32,763 --> 00:30:34,980
- (static hisses)
- What's your ETA?

467
00:30:34,982 --> 00:30:36,999
- (static hisses)
- Man on radio: A few minutes away,

468
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,984
- but the car is running on fumes.
- Paula: We have gas.

469
00:30:38,986 --> 00:30:40,936
We'll fill you up
and then we move.

470
00:30:40,938 --> 00:30:43,155
Radio when you're
back in the perimeter.

471
00:30:43,157 --> 00:30:45,774
- (static hisses)
- Man: Copy that.

472
00:30:45,776 --> 00:30:47,860
We gotta get ready.

473
00:30:47,862 --> 00:30:51,030
Pull 'Chelle out so she
doesn't get stuck in a fight.

474
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:53,115
We have to be ready
to move at any second.

475
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:54,700
What about the girl?

476
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:57,886
Leave her for now.

477
00:30:57,888 --> 00:31:00,706
If we leave, we travel light.

478
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:04,059
And if the pricks are here,
we pick 'em off at the door.

479
00:31:07,231 --> 00:31:09,715
(snarling)

480
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:16,705
Paula: Molls, we need
this hall clear.

481
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:29,652
(sighs)

482
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:35,758
(scraping)

483
00:31:50,391 --> 00:31:53,342
(walker snarling)

484
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:57,012
(panting)

485
00:31:57,014 --> 00:31:59,431
Just a sec, sugar.

486
00:32:02,853 --> 00:32:04,687
(grunts)

487
00:32:15,249 --> 00:32:16,915
(gasps)

488
00:32:28,312 --> 00:32:30,179
Are you okay?

489
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:32,581
I have to be.

490
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,550
They've spread out, but I think
we can make it past them.

491
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:37,219
- We have to try.
- We can't leave them alive.

492
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:38,804
No, we should just go.

493
00:32:38,806 --> 00:32:41,323
Carol, we have to finish this.
We have to.

494
00:33:13,974 --> 00:33:15,424
(blood tricking)

495
00:33:24,518 --> 00:33:26,602
(rasping)

496
00:33:28,022 --> 00:33:30,439
He was already dead.

497
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:33,992
- He's turning.
- We should go.

498
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,945
We need a gun.

499
00:33:38,532 --> 00:33:40,048
Give me that.

500
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,874
(faint growling)

501
00:33:58,385 --> 00:34:00,369
- (snarling)
- (screaming)

502
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:13,048
Eat shit and die, Donnie!

503
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:15,818
Where are ya, Magnolia?

504
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,237
I wanna bloody up
that nice...

505
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,088
(gags)

506
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,991
Agh!

507
00:34:22,993 --> 00:34:24,660
(thudding)

508
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:28,330
(shouting)

509
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:30,582
(screams, panting)

510
00:34:32,169 --> 00:34:33,836
Let's go.

511
00:34:35,089 --> 00:34:36,839
(door slams)

512
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:02,247
(clicks)

513
00:35:07,491 --> 00:35:09,375
(walkers snarling)

514
00:35:17,591 --> 00:35:19,241
Carol: They're using
them to keep us in,

515
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:20,993
keep the others out.

516
00:35:23,602 --> 00:35:25,488
Maggie:
Come on.

517
00:35:25,608 --> 00:35:27,416
We have to find 'em.

518
00:35:31,105 --> 00:35:33,672
(gunshots)

519
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:35,674
(trigger clicks)

520
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,680
(hammer clicks)

521
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:43,098
Just run.

522
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,183
Shoot her.

523
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:49,688
- (blade rings)
- Go on, do it.

524
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:53,625
You've killed Donnie,
you've killed Molly.

525
00:35:53,627 --> 00:35:56,695
Your people have
destroyed my home.

526
00:35:56,697 --> 00:35:58,580
- Get outta here.
- Carol.

527
00:35:58,582 --> 00:36:00,198
Paula:
You have no idea.

528
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,619
The things I've done,

529
00:36:03,621 --> 00:36:05,587
what I've given up,

530
00:36:05,589 --> 00:36:08,624
what I had to do.

531
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:10,976
- Just run.
- Maggie: Carol, shoot her.

532
00:36:10,978 --> 00:36:14,129
Go ahead. I've already
lost everything.

533
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:15,881
- (snarls)
- (gunshot)

534
00:36:15,883 --> 00:36:18,317
(grunts)

535
00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:20,719
'Chelle:
Paula?

536
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:22,604
Paula?

537
00:36:22,606 --> 00:36:24,473
(door squeaks open)

538
00:36:24,475 --> 00:36:26,275
'Chelle:
Molly?

539
00:36:28,445 --> 00:36:31,263
(grunting)

540
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:39,955
You lying bitch!

541
00:36:39,957 --> 00:36:42,474
(panting)

542
00:36:47,498 --> 00:36:49,414
(walkers growling)

543
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,753
(Paula groans)

544
00:36:58,142 --> 00:37:00,058
I'll do it.

545
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:04,513
(Paula laughs)

546
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:07,432
You're good.

547
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:09,151
Nervous little bird.

548
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:13,322
You were her.

549
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:19,144
But not now, right?

550
00:37:21,365 --> 00:37:22,614
Me, too.

551
00:37:24,368 --> 00:37:27,619
I told you to run.

552
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:30,706
If you could do all this,

553
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:34,376
what were you
so afraid of, Carol?

554
00:37:46,573 --> 00:37:49,541
I was afraid of this.

555
00:37:49,543 --> 00:37:51,643
(laughs)

556
00:37:55,249 --> 00:37:56,948
(grunting)

557
00:38:05,993 --> 00:38:08,427
(screaming)

558
00:38:09,763 --> 00:38:12,080
(grunts)

559
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:14,533
(screaming)

560
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:20,722
Man on radio: Paula, we're
approaching the perimeter.

561
00:38:20,724 --> 00:38:22,374
Are we a go?

562
00:38:22,376 --> 00:38:25,343
(Paula screaming)

563
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:27,579
(Paula gurgling)

564
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,687
Man:
Do you copy?

565
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:43,745
(static hisses)

566
00:38:43,747 --> 00:38:46,248
(imitating Paula)
Meet us on the kill floor.

567
00:38:51,205 --> 00:38:55,207
I think I might have
killed 18 people.

568
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:56,708
20.

569
00:38:59,596 --> 00:39:02,047
I should've killed
Donnie, too, in the woods.

570
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:04,883
I had a clear shot.
I didn't miss.

571
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:11,306
None of this would've happened
if I had just killed him.

572
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:14,559
- Don't think about it.
- I can't stop.

573
00:39:15,863 --> 00:39:18,396
We're almost done.

574
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:20,599
(footsteps passing)

575
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:37,132
Man: Careful. The floor's slick.

576
00:39:37,134 --> 00:39:38,834
Man #2:
You sure this is it?

577
00:39:38,836 --> 00:39:41,002
Man:
She said kill floor.

578
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:43,472
(lighter clicks)

579
00:39:43,474 --> 00:39:45,624
Man #3:
Hey, this one's locked.

580
00:39:46,677 --> 00:39:49,177
(rumbling)

581
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:52,347
What the hell?!
Agh!

582
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:54,349
(screaming, pounding on door)

583
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:58,687
(screaming, pounding continue)

584
00:40:30,304 --> 00:40:33,555
(distorted growling)

585
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:07,672
(echoes)
Maggie.

586
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:09,057
You okay?

587
00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:11,393
We got your trail.

588
00:41:11,395 --> 00:41:14,062
- You start a fire?
- Yeah.

589
00:41:14,064 --> 00:41:16,514
Hey, you good?

590
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:18,266
No.

591
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:20,018
Come here.

592
00:41:21,772 --> 00:41:24,689
They're dead. They're all
dead, the ones that took us.

593
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:26,524
They're all dead.

594
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:28,910
Hey, are you okay?

595
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,697
I just...

596
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:34,766
I can't anymore.

597
00:41:35,769 --> 00:41:36,785
It's okay.

598
00:41:36,787 --> 00:41:39,287
Your friends are dead.

599
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:42,040
No one's coming for ya.

600
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:43,541
So you might as well talk.

601
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:46,628
Let him burn.

602
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:49,297
I'm gonna ask you
one last time...

603
00:41:50,384 --> 00:41:52,133
how'd you get the bike?

604
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:54,052
- We found it.
- Daryl: Like hell you did.

605
00:41:54,054 --> 00:41:55,220
We found it.

606
00:41:55,222 --> 00:41:56,972
Was Negan in
that building last night

607
00:41:56,974 --> 00:41:58,723
or was he here?

608
00:42:04,448 --> 00:42:06,281
Both.

609
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:10,235
I'm Negan, shithead.

610
00:42:12,072 --> 00:42:14,739
There's a whole world of fun
that we can talk about,

611
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:15,940
so let's have a chat.

612
00:42:15,942 --> 00:42:17,108
I'm sorry it had
to come to this.

613
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,744
(gunshot echoes)

614
00:42:26,186 --> 00:42:34,186
