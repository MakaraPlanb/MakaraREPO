Those people you met, the
ones in the burnt forest,

3
00:00:06,216 --> 00:00:07,883
you saved them, right?

4
00:00:07,984 --> 00:00:08,684

You're going to let us into
your little complex,

whatever and whoever we want.

have to end, not this way,

00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:24,900
but it's how it has to be.

12
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:27,069
So I'm going like I
always should have.

13
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,064
Don't come after me, please.

I can see you.

Carol?

You here?

What happened?

00:02:44,029 --> 00:02:46,262
Oh, I just slipped.

Building a new guard tower.

33
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:51,534
I went to the infirmary.

34
00:02:51,536 --> 00:02:53,870
It's so quiet over there now.

35
00:02:54,972 --> 00:02:58,775
I knew Denise
since the beginning.

36
00:02:58,777 --> 00:03:03,312
She wasn't around much
before Pete, but...

37
00:03:03,314 --> 00:03:06,816
before that,
she just stayed inside.

38
00:03:06,818 --> 00:03:10,720
(Tobin's voice fading) She was
always-- was always reading something.

39
00:03:10,722 --> 00:03:13,756
And she really stepped up
when she had to.

40
00:03:13,758 --> 00:03:15,558
She was there for us.

00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,127
(continues indistinctly)

42
00:03:28,305 --> 00:03:30,039
I didn't mean to bring it up.

43
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:33,543
No, it's just--

44
00:03:33,545 --> 00:03:37,146
I just keep thinking about
Tara, when she finds out.

00:03:37,148 --> 00:03:38,681
Ah.

46
00:03:38,683 --> 00:03:42,585

No, no, no, no.

110
00:08:11,923 --> 00:08:14,657
- Yeah? Why not?
- No.

111
00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:17,026
Maggie has us on a schedule

112
00:08:17,028 --> 00:08:20,696
and I'm not pissing off
a pregnant lady.

113
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:24,000
Yeah.

114
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:27,470
- Not that pregnant lady.
- Right.

115
00:08:27,472 --> 00:08:31,140
- Go.

00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,415
She's worried about an attack.

118
00:08:41,618 --> 00:08:45,021
When they come for us,
we'll end it,

119
00:08:45,023 --> 00:08:47,023
the whole thing.

120
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:50,459
This won't be like before.

121
00:08:50,461 --> 00:08:51,994
We're putting
everything in place

122
00:08:51,996 --> 00:08:53,829
and these people
know what to do now.

123
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:59,201
The world's ours,

124
00:08:59,203 --> 00:09:01,337
and we know how to take it.

125
00:09:07,044 --> 00:09:09,545
Everything we need

126
00:09:09,547 --> 00:09:13,015
is right here
inside these walls.

127
00:09:14,651 --> 00:09:17,686
We're not losing
any of it again.

128
00:09:17,688 --> 00:09:18,954
I'm not.

129
00:09:18,956 --> 00:09:21,624
No, you're not.

130
00:09:28,298 --> 00:09:30,366
I'm not.

131
00:09:39,276 --> 00:09:41,744
We'll have these,
but we should hide a few.

132
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:44,480
That way, we can find them,
but strangers can't.

133
00:09:44,482 --> 00:09:46,315
In case anyone gets in.

134
00:09:47,984 --> 00:09:49,452
They won't.

135
00:09:49,454 --> 00:09:51,587
(motorcycle engine revving)

136
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:52,788
Oh, no.

137
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:03,277
Where are you going?

138
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,778
Out.

139
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,680
No, shit.
You got specifics?

140
00:10:06,682 --> 00:10:08,916
What the hell is he doing?

141
00:10:08,918 --> 00:10:10,751
Something he shouldn't.

142
00:10:10,753 --> 00:10:12,920
We gotta stop him.

143
00:10:21,796 --> 00:10:24,098
(engine starts)

144
00:10:27,135 --> 00:10:28,335
- Whoa!
- (brakes squeal)

145
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:29,770
Make room for my freckled ass.

146
00:10:29,772 --> 00:10:31,071
No.

147
00:10:31,073 --> 00:10:32,973
Cover my watch.
You stay.

148
00:10:32,975 --> 00:10:34,942
Hey, we should
keep numbers here.

149
00:10:34,944 --> 00:10:36,143
I know where Daryl's going.

150
00:10:54,596 --> 00:10:56,163
(knock on door)

151
00:11:08,843 --> 00:11:10,811
What time did she leave?
Do you know what she took?

152
00:11:10,813 --> 00:11:12,479
Sometime in the night.
I never heard her go,

153
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:14,048
but she made a bunch
of food, you know.

154
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,383
- She took her pack, one of my coats--
- Did she leave on foot?

155
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,152
I-- I don't know.

156
00:11:18,154 --> 00:11:21,155
Sasha: Rick, I took over at
12:00. I was on till 6:00.

157
00:11:21,157 --> 00:11:22,823
I never saw anything.

158
00:11:22,825 --> 00:11:25,259
Front's been quiet
since the others left.

159
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:26,694
What? Who?

160
00:11:26,696 --> 00:11:29,396
Daryl. He went ICBM after
the Saviors from yesterday.

161
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:33,767
Glenn, Michonne, Rosita, they all
went to shut that shit down.

162
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:37,271
Tobin:
Where's the other car?

163
00:11:37,273 --> 00:11:39,840
We added two more cars
yesterday.

164
00:11:39,842 --> 00:11:42,786
One of them's missing, the one we
put right between those houses.

165
00:11:42,906 --> 00:11:45,079
You can barely see between
the houses from up top,

166
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,038
especially at night.

167
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,106
The note, can I see it?

168
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:52,063
You never saw any
headlights, taillights?

169
00:11:52,192 --> 00:11:54,659
She's smart enough
to cover her tracks.

170
00:11:54,661 --> 00:11:57,662
Sasha: She must've left
during the shift change.

171
00:11:57,664 --> 00:11:58,963
Where are you going?

172
00:11:58,965 --> 00:12:01,032
Morgan:
I'm gonna go find her.

173
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:02,567
Wait.

174
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:07,005
Tell Carl I'll be back soon.

175
00:12:07,007 --> 00:12:09,173
No one else leaves.

176
00:12:09,175 --> 00:12:11,275
Everyone else stays
ready for a fight.

177
00:12:11,277 --> 00:12:13,578
(engine starts)

178
00:13:07,015 --> 00:13:08,215

(panting)

181
00:13:27,602 --> 00:13:29,236
(turns off engine)

182
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,383
Hands up.

183
00:13:46,254 --> 00:13:48,088
Please don't hurt me.

184
00:13:48,572 --> 00:13:52,593
Why does everyone
always assume the worst?

185
00:13:52,595 --> 00:13:54,728
How 'bout you come on out?

186
00:14:07,842 --> 00:14:09,776
I just have the car.

187
00:14:15,984 --> 00:14:19,353
And a knife for the dead
ones, nothing else.

188
00:14:20,555 --> 00:14:24,191
Naw, you got information.

189
00:14:24,193 --> 00:14:27,327
Like where you're from,
where you're going.

190
00:14:29,573 --> 00:14:31,273
Aw, come on,
it's a lonely world.

191
00:14:31,275 --> 00:14:33,008
Let's get to know each other.

192
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,144
I'm Jiro.

193
00:14:35,146 --> 00:14:37,546
Your turn.

194
00:14:37,548 --> 00:14:40,015
I'm nobody, really.

195
00:14:41,718 --> 00:14:44,119
Nancy from Montclair.

196
00:14:47,624 --> 00:14:49,658
But I've bounced around
a lot since then.

197
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,860
I-- I keep moving.

198
00:14:53,663 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm not really from anywhere.
I'm not really going anywhere.

199
00:14:58,002 --> 00:14:59,535
Jiro:
Well...

200
00:14:59,537 --> 00:15:03,706
at least we agree on one
thing, Nancy from Montclair--

201
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:07,176
you're not going anywhere.

202
00:15:07,178 --> 00:15:10,946
But you do seem like
you're from somewhere.

203
00:15:10,948 --> 00:15:14,183
After Montclair, right?

204
00:15:14,185 --> 00:15:16,619
Miles, what's that place called?

205
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:20,656
The gated one
12.75 clicks down?

206
00:15:20,658 --> 00:15:22,591
Miles:
Alexandria.

207
00:15:22,593 --> 00:15:25,527
Yeah, Alexandria.

208
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:28,297
You know, they got some cars out
front, spikes through them,

209
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:30,766
just like the one
you're driving.

210
00:15:31,935 --> 00:15:33,736
A woman like you,

211
00:15:33,738 --> 00:15:36,905
no weapons, no protection,

212
00:15:36,907 --> 00:15:39,575
no clue,

213
00:15:39,577 --> 00:15:43,012
you really shouldn't
be out here alone.

214
00:15:43,014 --> 00:15:45,414
You know, we were just
on our way to your place.

215
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,650
We can give you a ride back.

216
00:15:47,652 --> 00:15:51,053
Maybe they'll let us in
if you're with us.

217
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,065
(panting)

218
00:16:07,237 --> 00:16:10,339
(Carol continues panting)

219
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:24,253
It doesn't have to be this way.

220
00:16:24,255 --> 00:16:26,288
You could turn back
and you could go home.

221
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:29,258
Nobody has to get hurt.

222
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,493
It's looking like
someone's gotta get hurt.

223
00:16:33,463 --> 00:16:36,332
Please.
(whimpers)

224
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:37,866
Please.

225
00:16:37,868 --> 00:16:39,635
Man, why don't you just grab
her before she passes out?

226
00:16:39,637 --> 00:16:42,504
(sobbing)

227
00:16:42,506 --> 00:16:44,473
Carol:
Don't, please!

228
00:16:44,475 --> 00:16:47,376
(automatic gunfire)

229
00:16:52,048 --> 00:16:55,951
(gun clicking)

230
00:17:29,352 --> 00:17:31,453
(grunts)

231
00:17:56,798 --> 00:17:58,666
I can see you.

232
00:17:58,668 --> 00:18:01,102
Come out slowly.

233
00:18:01,104 --> 00:18:04,005
Jiro: Yeah, I think I'm
gonna pass on that.

234
00:18:05,707 --> 00:18:07,775
(truck creaking)

235
00:18:18,086 --> 00:18:19,420
(knife rings)

236
00:18:22,257 --> 00:18:25,192
- (Jiro yells)
- (gunshot echoes)

237
00:18:35,597 --> 00:18:37,198
- Hey.
- Hey.

238
00:18:41,103 --> 00:18:42,570
You look tired.

239
00:18:42,572 --> 00:18:45,039
We still have a lot to do.

240
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:48,042
Glenn, Michonne, and Rosita
just took off after Daryl.

241
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,277
I'm taking an extra shift.

242
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:51,512
Just packing a lunch
before I go back out.

243
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,485
- See you later.
- Where are you going?

244
00:18:57,487 --> 00:18:59,053
Take your shift while you rest.

245
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:01,289
Enid...

246
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,257
Just for a few hours.

247
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,028
Let me help.

248
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:09,864
Put up your feet
and eat some pickles.

249
00:19:09,866 --> 00:19:14,402
(door opens, closes)

250
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:22,477
You didn't have to come.

251
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:27,615
We have to try,
even if it's a long shot,

252
00:19:27,617 --> 00:19:29,350
even if it's dangerous.

253
00:19:31,386 --> 00:19:33,354
Tire tracks pointed east...

254
00:19:35,057 --> 00:19:37,291
we go east.

255
00:19:37,293 --> 00:19:39,660
Saviors' compound
that you and the group--

256
00:19:40,996 --> 00:19:43,397
that you went to,

257
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:45,233
that was west.

258
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:51,806
Seems like she went east.

259
00:19:58,914 --> 00:20:02,650
You don't even know Carol.

260
00:20:02,652 --> 00:20:04,986
Oh, I got to.

261
00:20:04,988 --> 00:20:06,888
A little.

262
00:20:11,727 --> 00:20:13,594
Why are you doing this?

263
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:22,470
What I believe--
I'm not right.

264
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:26,240
There is no right.

265
00:20:26,242 --> 00:20:28,943
There's just the wrong
that doesn't pull you down.

266
00:20:35,217 --> 00:20:37,218
It hasn't pulled me down.

267
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,722
I think it will.

268
00:20:44,526 --> 00:20:47,161
'Cause I know you.

269
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:50,097
(sighs)

270
00:20:55,404 --> 00:20:57,371
(groaning)

271
00:20:57,373 --> 00:20:59,006
God dang--!

272
00:21:01,543 --> 00:21:04,545
(man whimpers)

273
00:21:04,547 --> 00:21:07,048
Oh, man.

274
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:16,524
(groaning)

275
00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:27,935
Shh.

276
00:21:27,937 --> 00:21:29,437
Shh!

277
00:21:31,406 --> 00:21:34,542
Just let it go, man.
Just let go.

278
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,357
Oh, God.

279
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:05,606
There.

280
00:22:05,608 --> 00:22:07,508
I see it.

281
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:20,221
(Jiro groaning)

282
00:22:24,192 --> 00:22:25,960
That's her car.

283
00:22:29,131 --> 00:22:30,932
You see her?

284
00:22:35,504 --> 00:22:37,571
No.

285
00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:48,716
Hey, where is she?

286
00:22:48,718 --> 00:22:50,885
(gurgles)

287
00:23:12,274 --> 00:23:15,943
The Saviors were getting weapons
from the Hilltop's blacksmith.

288
00:23:15,945 --> 00:23:17,845
These men were Saviors.

289
00:23:22,718 --> 00:23:25,586
(growling)

290
00:23:33,061 --> 00:23:34,795
There's blood here.

291
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,798
She could've been hit.

292
00:23:43,372 --> 00:23:45,873
I'm proud of her.

293
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:48,409
How's that?

294
00:23:48,411 --> 00:23:51,979
She took four of them down.

295
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:54,181
That woman,
she's a force of nature.

296
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,684
She left because
she can't anymore.

297
00:23:56,686 --> 00:23:58,185
That's what her letter said.

298
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:00,855
She could because she had to.

299
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,391
Sometimes you have to.

300
00:24:06,228 --> 00:24:09,497
There's more blood
opposite these men

301
00:24:09,499 --> 00:24:11,632
that leads into the field.

302
00:24:11,634 --> 00:24:14,201
It's a trail.
Could be Carol's.

303
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:16,103
She could still be alive.

304
00:24:16,105 --> 00:24:17,838
She's not here.

305
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,907
Most of their guns are gone.

306
00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:21,642
She might've taken them.

307
00:24:21,644 --> 00:24:23,444
Those, too.

308
00:24:23,446 --> 00:24:25,946
(sighs)

309
00:24:25,948 --> 00:24:29,517
Or she could've died here,

310
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:32,019
even if she isn't here.

311
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,989
Trail goes this way.

312
00:24:41,263 --> 00:24:43,898
They were close to Alexandria.

313
00:24:45,133 --> 00:24:47,435
There's even more of them.

314
00:24:47,437 --> 00:24:50,271
We didn't end it.

315
00:24:50,273 --> 00:24:52,773
No.

316
00:24:52,775 --> 00:24:54,742
You started something.

317
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,098
(snarling)

318
00:26:10,352 --> 00:26:11,886
- (blade rings)
- (snarling stops)

319
00:26:11,888 --> 00:26:13,754
That's where she died.

320
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,760
All right, so he had
to start from here.

321
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,167
He did.

322
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:29,870
Which way did Dwight run?

323
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:34,141
Rosita?

324
00:26:37,946 --> 00:26:39,780
We should let him do this.

325
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:43,984
But he doesn't know
what he's doing.

326
00:26:43,986 --> 00:26:46,754
We don't.

327
00:26:46,756 --> 00:26:49,690
Maybe him trying this makes you
feel better about it right now.

328
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:53,427
Maybe they keep knowing more about
us than we know about them.

329
00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:57,598
Or maybe Daryl's
gonna get himself killed.

330
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:03,204
Which way did Dwight run?

331
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:42,409
(rustling)

332
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,021
Rosita: Watch the
hell out, asshole.

333
00:27:54,023 --> 00:27:55,789
I did.
You shouldn't have come.

334
00:27:55,791 --> 00:27:57,558
Michonne:
You shouldn't have left.

335
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:02,062
When I split off
from Sasha and Abraham,

336
00:28:02,064 --> 00:28:04,732
he was out there in the woods, in that
burned-out forest with them girls,

337
00:28:04,734 --> 00:28:08,035
put a gun to my head,
tied me up.

338
00:28:09,871 --> 00:28:11,372
I even tried to help him.

339
00:28:11,374 --> 00:28:13,974
Glenn: So, you think
it's your fault?

340
00:28:13,976 --> 00:28:16,443
Yeah, I know it is.

341
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:18,012
I'm gonna go do what I
should've done before.

342
00:28:18,014 --> 00:28:20,881
What, for her?

343
00:28:20,883 --> 00:28:23,450
She's gone, man.

344
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,886
You're doing this for you.

345
00:28:25,888 --> 00:28:27,288
Man, I don't give a shit.

346
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,156
Daryl...

347
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:34,728
we need to get back there
and figure this out from home.

348
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:37,498
Our home.

349
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,201
We need you, and everyone back
there needs us right now.

350
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,507
It's-- it's gonna
go wrong out here.

351
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:51,512
We'll square it.
I will.

352
00:28:51,514 --> 00:28:54,415
I promise you.

353
00:28:54,417 --> 00:28:56,183
Just come back.

354
00:29:00,955 --> 00:29:03,057
I can't.

355
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:05,125
- Daryl.
- Man, I can't!

356
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,468
I can't either.

357
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:37,524
Glenn: Thing is, those men could
be back in Alexandria right now.

358
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,226
If they are, they're dead.

359
00:29:39,228 --> 00:29:41,628
I hope not.

360
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,263
We need them alive.

361
00:29:43,265 --> 00:29:45,032
We need to find out more.

362
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:47,835
Yeah, we do.

363
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:58,011
We just got stuck
with each other.

364
00:29:58,013 --> 00:30:00,614
We were lucky.

365
00:30:04,018 --> 00:30:06,019
We figured it all out together.

366
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,823
It felt like we did.

367
00:30:09,825 --> 00:30:12,493
After everything, we did.

368
00:30:19,467 --> 00:30:21,668
The world's not
what we thought it was.

369
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:27,975
Hilltop, the Saviors,
it's bigger.

370
00:30:27,977 --> 00:30:29,977
(man whistles)

371
00:30:29,979 --> 00:30:31,779
(rifle cocks)

372
00:30:31,781 --> 00:30:34,982
- (man whistles)
- (rifle cocks)

373
00:30:34,984 --> 00:30:37,418
(man whistles)

374
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:51,999
Hi.

375
00:31:24,221 --> 00:31:27,156
It's not much.

376
00:31:27,521 --> 00:31:30,489
But if it's Carol's, then she's
been bleeding for a while.

377
00:31:36,362 --> 00:31:39,965
So, you out here because
Carol is your friend?

378
00:31:39,967 --> 00:31:43,301
I'm out here
'cause she's my family.

379
00:31:45,972 --> 00:31:48,240
I've talked to people
back there.

380
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:52,177
I found out about
what happened at the prison.

381
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:54,479
How you sent her away.

382
00:31:55,815 --> 00:31:57,649
She killed two
of your people, right?

383
00:31:57,651 --> 00:31:59,418
Burned their bodies.

384
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:04,322
What if that had happened today?

385
00:32:04,324 --> 00:32:05,924
Would you kill her?

386
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:09,027
If it happened today,
I'd thank her.

387
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:11,430
Or I would've
killed them myself.

388
00:32:11,432 --> 00:32:14,099
She was right to do it.

389
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:16,201
They were sick,
spreading a disease.

390
00:32:16,203 --> 00:32:17,903
They weren't gonna make it.

391
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:21,073
Yeah, but this was back then.

392
00:32:21,075 --> 00:32:23,041
And you didn't kill her.

393
00:32:24,077 --> 00:32:27,913
You sent her away, Rick,
and she came back.

394
00:32:27,915 --> 00:32:30,449
And she came back
and she saved all y'all.

395
00:32:33,252 --> 00:32:35,320
People can come back, Rick.

396
00:32:50,203 --> 00:32:53,071
(walker growling)

397
00:32:57,076 --> 00:32:59,111
It's not her.

398
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:04,449
(grunts)

399
00:33:08,254 --> 00:33:11,022
Morgan: She couldn't have
been dead more than a day.

400
00:33:13,226 --> 00:33:15,427
(distant creaking)

401
00:33:34,247 --> 00:33:36,248
(snarling)

402
00:33:38,551 --> 00:33:39,651
- Hey!
- (hammer clicks)

403
00:33:39,653 --> 00:33:41,286
Whoa, whoa!

404
00:33:41,288 --> 00:33:43,221
- It's okay. I'm not trouble.
- (door closes)

405
00:33:43,223 --> 00:33:44,356
I don't want any trouble.

406
00:33:44,358 --> 00:33:46,992
Come out, drop your weapons.

407
00:33:46,994 --> 00:33:48,860
Man:
I can't do that.

408
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:50,829
The wasted are too close.

409
00:33:50,831 --> 00:33:53,498
I'm just looking for my horse.
Have you seen him?

410
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,966
No.

411
00:33:56,969 --> 00:33:59,571
We're looking for our friend.
Have you seen her?

412
00:33:59,573 --> 00:34:02,040
- Rick: Have you seen her?
- (walkers snarling)

413
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:03,575
Man:
They're coming!

414
00:34:03,577 --> 00:34:06,044
Just go!
Just go!

415
00:34:08,014 --> 00:34:09,681
(door opens)

416
00:34:10,683 --> 00:34:12,017
Stop!

417
00:34:13,486 --> 00:34:14,986
(walkers snarling)

418
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,968
(panting)

419
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:36,908
Rick.

420
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,176
We didn't know who he was.

421
00:34:39,512 --> 00:34:42,981
Yeah, it's one of the Hilltop's.

422
00:34:42,983 --> 00:34:45,450
Like the one on the road.

423
00:34:45,452 --> 00:34:47,919
Maybe he's one of them.

424
00:34:47,921 --> 00:34:49,688
Maybe he's looking
for Carol, too.

425
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,790
Maybe the man is just
looking for a horse.

426
00:34:51,792 --> 00:34:54,926
Maybe he is from Hilltop.
Maybe he's from somewhere else.

427
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:04,669
I don't take chances anymore.

428
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,881
Those people...

429
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,118
the Wolves...

430
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:24,289
after they attacked,
I found one of them.

431
00:35:26,759 --> 00:35:29,227
He had attacked me
on the road before,

432
00:35:29,229 --> 00:35:31,296
when I was trying to find you.

433
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:32,931
And I stopped him.

434
00:35:35,468 --> 00:35:38,403
But I let him live.

435
00:35:38,405 --> 00:35:41,039
And then he was there in
Alexandria after the attack,

436
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:44,042
hiding in one of the brownstones,
so I stopped him again.

437
00:35:44,044 --> 00:35:47,245
I knocked him out
and I could have killed him.

438
00:35:51,284 --> 00:35:53,518
But all life is precious.

439
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:04,596
Put him in the cell
of the brownstone basement.

440
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:09,167
'Cause I knew he could change.

441
00:36:09,169 --> 00:36:10,835
We all can change.

442
00:36:10,837 --> 00:36:14,906
- You had one of them alive in the community?
- Oh, yeah.

443
00:36:14,908 --> 00:36:19,144
And when the walls came down and the
walkers broke in, Carol found out.

444
00:36:19,146 --> 00:36:21,479
We fought and that man escaped,

445
00:36:21,481 --> 00:36:23,214
and Denise...

446
00:36:25,117 --> 00:36:27,152
she had come to the cell
to try and help him

447
00:36:27,154 --> 00:36:30,221
and he took her hostage.

448
00:36:30,223 --> 00:36:35,160
And then she and that Wolf,
they got swarmed,

449
00:36:35,162 --> 00:36:37,796
and that man, that killer,

450
00:36:37,798 --> 00:36:41,099
he saved her life.

451
00:36:41,101 --> 00:36:44,102
And then Denise
was there to save Carl.

452
00:36:44,104 --> 00:36:46,738
It--

453
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,773
it's all a circle.

454
00:36:50,142 --> 00:36:51,943
Everything gets a return.

455
00:37:00,252 --> 00:37:03,355
But the fact is the fact.

456
00:37:03,357 --> 00:37:05,990
I did what I did.

457
00:37:05,992 --> 00:37:08,226
I let him live.

458
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:18,336
You go home, Rick.

459
00:37:18,338 --> 00:37:21,606
You take the car.
You're needed back there.

460
00:37:21,608 --> 00:37:23,775
You shouldn't be out here
taking any more chances.

461
00:37:23,777 --> 00:37:25,543
I'm not leaving.

462
00:37:25,545 --> 00:37:28,880
- Carol's still out here.
- And I will find her.

463
00:37:28,882 --> 00:37:30,648
Somehow.

464
00:37:33,219 --> 00:37:34,919
You go.

465
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:40,392
You're coming back.

466
00:37:43,896 --> 00:37:46,264
Yeah.

467
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:48,733
But if I don't,
don't come looking.

468
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:55,874
Take it.

469
00:37:55,876 --> 00:37:58,309
- No, I--
- Take it.

470
00:38:07,787 --> 00:38:09,821
Morgan?

471
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:20,231
Michonne did steal
that protein bar.

472
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:25,103
Oh, I know.

473
00:38:46,684 --> 00:38:50,354
Morgan's still
out there looking.

474
00:38:50,356 --> 00:38:52,189
Is Michonne here?

475
00:38:52,798 --> 00:38:55,459
She's still out there, too.

476
00:39:07,238 --> 00:39:09,940
You afraid...

477
00:39:09,942 --> 00:39:12,042
to go back to it?

478
00:39:14,746 --> 00:39:17,047
Let somebody close?

479
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:27,257
Yeah. Yeah.

480
00:39:29,227 --> 00:39:30,961
Mm.

481
00:39:32,781 --> 00:39:35,483
Me, too.

482
00:39:35,485 --> 00:39:37,819
But now...

483
00:39:41,156 --> 00:39:42,590
I think I'm that much more ready

484
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:45,326
to tear the world
a brand-new asshole.

485
00:39:45,328 --> 00:39:48,930
(both chuckle)

486
00:39:57,272 --> 00:39:59,440
Any second now.

487
00:40:01,476 --> 00:40:03,277
Yeah.

488
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,214
Any second.

489
00:40:16,491 --> 00:40:18,492
(knocks)

490
00:40:30,172 --> 00:40:32,974
Scott said you
were looking for me?

491
00:40:32,976 --> 00:40:34,842
What's up?

492
00:40:37,346 --> 00:40:39,413
I need some more help.

493
00:40:46,889 --> 00:40:49,090
(scissors snip)

494
00:40:55,464 --> 00:40:57,198
Enid:
I like it.

495
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,866
But why?

496
00:40:58,868 --> 00:41:01,636
(sighs)

497
00:41:01,638 --> 00:41:04,472
Hmm.
I have to keep going.

498
00:41:07,709 --> 00:41:10,278
And I don't want anything
getting in my way.

499
00:41:17,586 --> 00:41:20,021
- (exhales)
- Man, did I go too short?

500
00:41:20,023 --> 00:41:22,356
I-I only used
to cut my dad's.

501
00:41:22,358 --> 00:41:24,358
No, it's not that.

502
00:41:25,928 --> 00:41:28,562
Maggie?

503
00:41:28,564 --> 00:41:30,665
Ah!

504
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,535
Maggie.

505
00:41:34,537 --> 00:41:36,537
- (groaning)
- Maggie!

506
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:38,472
(whimpering)

507
00:41:40,575 --> 00:41:42,677
(screaming)

508
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:12,006
(muffled shouting)

509
00:42:13,275 --> 00:42:15,576
- (hammer clicks)
- Dwight: Hi, Daryl.

510
00:42:17,112 --> 00:42:19,213
(rifle cocks)

511
00:42:25,921 --> 00:42:28,086
(body thuds)

512
00:42:28,206 --> 00:42:30,191
Dwight:
You'll be all right.
