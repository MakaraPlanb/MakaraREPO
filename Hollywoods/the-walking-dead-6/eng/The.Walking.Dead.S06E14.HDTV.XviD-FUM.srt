<i>Previously on
AMC's "The Walking Dead..."</i>

2
00:00:04,208 --> 00:00:06,758
<i>I'd like to get
to know you a whole lot better.</i>

3
00:00:06,877 --> 00:00:08,877
What makes you think...

4
00:00:08,962 --> 00:00:10,378
I want that?

5
00:00:10,464 --> 00:00:12,180
- <i>Right behind you.</i>
- You don't have to.

6
00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:13,682
No one gets to clock out today.

7
00:00:15,436 --> 00:00:17,385
It's a way out,
for them and for us.

8
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:19,805
<i>Where there's life,
there's possibility.</i>

9
00:00:21,024 --> 00:00:22,024
I'm leaving.

10
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:22,941
You are not walking
out that door

11
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,609
unless you can tell me why.

12
00:00:26,313 --> 00:00:28,280
- <i>Hi, you good?</i>
- No.

13
00:01:53,817 --> 00:01:55,250
Morgan?

14
00:01:59,656 --> 00:02:01,756
Wh... why?

15
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,631
It'll give you
some choices next time.

16
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:17,175
Didn't even notice.

17
00:04:17,177 --> 00:04:19,177
Got your bike back.

18
00:04:19,179 --> 00:04:21,329
Yeah.

19
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:25,050
You got another one of those?

20
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:33,058
Thanks.

21
00:04:40,817 --> 00:04:45,236
Those people you met, the ones in the
burnt forest, they took it from you?

22
00:04:45,238 --> 00:04:47,155
Yeah.

23
00:04:49,993 --> 00:04:51,876
You saved them, right?

24
00:04:55,382 --> 00:04:56,831
Sorry.

25
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,333
It's who you are.

26
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:03,004
We're still stuck with that.

27
00:05:03,006 --> 00:05:05,173
No, we ain't.

28
00:05:05,175 --> 00:05:06,508
I should've killed them.

29
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,626
Hey.

30
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,697
<i>The ones that took
you and Maggie...</i>

31
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:32,117
what'd they do to you?

32
00:05:37,073 --> 00:05:38,673
To us?

33
00:05:38,675 --> 00:05:40,742
They didn't do anything.

34
00:06:45,966 --> 00:06:53,966

35
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,404
So, if you didn't
already have plans,

36
00:07:32,524 --> 00:07:34,376
I was thinking of making
my beef jerky stroganoff.

37
00:07:34,474 --> 00:07:36,674
I'm good, thanks.

38
00:07:36,676 --> 00:07:38,242
It's not exactly
a nice porterhouse,

39
00:07:38,244 --> 00:07:40,111
but I promise it's better
than it sounds.

40
00:07:40,113 --> 00:07:42,163
I'm sure it is.

41
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,117
What?

42
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:47,952
What are we doing?

43
00:07:50,206 --> 00:07:52,590
Just tell me.
It's good either way.

44
00:07:52,592 --> 00:07:54,291
It really is.

45
00:07:57,163 --> 00:07:58,896
Okay.

46
00:07:58,898 --> 00:08:01,699
- Okay is what we're doing?
- We'll do dinner.

47
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:03,367
Okay?

48
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:05,035
All right.

49
00:08:07,106 --> 00:08:08,639
See you then.

50
00:08:08,641 --> 00:08:10,741
Okay.

51
00:08:12,078 --> 00:08:15,546
I didn't hear you guys.

52
00:08:15,548 --> 00:08:17,148
Good.

53
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,066
Today's lesson will be
in the cul-de-sac.

54
00:08:19,068 --> 00:08:22,737
Actually, can we do
something else?

55
00:08:22,739 --> 00:08:25,022
After I got out
of DC, I just drove.

56
00:08:25,024 --> 00:08:28,259
I remember seeing it right when I
realized I had no idea where I was going.

57
00:08:28,261 --> 00:08:31,495
Edison's Apothecary
and Boutique.

58
00:08:31,497 --> 00:08:34,698
It's just this little
gift shop in a strip mall,

59
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,334
but if it's really
an apothecary,

60
00:08:37,336 --> 00:08:39,136
they had drugs.

61
00:08:39,138 --> 00:08:41,639
<i>How do you know
they still got 'em?</i>

62
00:08:41,641 --> 00:08:44,341
It isn't that far.
I just wanna check.

63
00:08:44,343 --> 00:08:47,728
And you and Rosita aren't out
scavenging or pulling shifts.

64
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,313
We'll go.

65
00:08:49,315 --> 00:08:51,932
I wanted to check.

66
00:08:51,934 --> 00:08:54,285
I just wanted to help.

67
00:08:54,287 --> 00:08:57,271
How much time
you spend out there?

68
00:08:57,273 --> 00:08:58,989
- None.
- Forget it.

69
00:08:58,991 --> 00:09:01,759
I can ID the meds. I know
how to use a machete now.

70
00:09:01,761 --> 00:09:03,527
I've seen roamers up close.

71
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:04,762
I'm ready.

72
00:09:04,764 --> 00:09:07,631
- You good with this?
- No.

73
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:09,099
I'll go alone, if I have to.

74
00:09:09,101 --> 00:09:10,534
You'll die alone.

75
00:09:10,536 --> 00:09:12,636
I'm asking you
to make sure I don't.

76
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,709
I'm not babysitting her
by myself.

77
00:09:35,144 --> 00:09:38,145
It... the...

78
00:09:38,147 --> 00:09:39,864
What?

79
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:41,282
Forget it.

80
00:09:41,284 --> 00:09:45,369
No, what?

81
00:09:45,371 --> 00:09:49,573
I think maybe you're
disengaging it too soon.

82
00:09:49,575 --> 00:09:51,675
I've been driving stick
since I was 15,

83
00:09:51,677 --> 00:09:54,979
usually beat-up trucks
like this.

84
00:09:54,981 --> 00:09:57,414
I mean, before... you know,
before I left home.

85
00:10:02,622 --> 00:10:05,589
My brother taught me,
so I just know.

86
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,602
Daryl.

87
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:22,022
Yep.

88
00:10:29,482 --> 00:10:31,248
Stay here.

89
00:10:48,718 --> 00:10:50,301
I got it.

90
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:06,650
This happened fast.

91
00:11:06,652 --> 00:11:08,819
Tree rotted out.
It wasn't people.

92
00:11:29,575 --> 00:11:31,842
Come on, it's clear.

93
00:11:34,347 --> 00:11:35,646
What'd you find?

94
00:11:35,648 --> 00:11:38,349
Bottles of booze.
Any takers?

95
00:11:38,351 --> 00:11:39,683
No, thanks.

96
00:11:39,685 --> 00:11:41,568
For later.
I'm not bringing these to the pantry.

97
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,987
I'm good.

98
00:11:42,989 --> 00:11:45,689
They were kind of
my parents' thing.

99
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:47,908
Which is why they aren't mine.

100
00:11:50,196 --> 00:11:51,996
That truck ain't gonna
make it past this tree.

101
00:11:51,998 --> 00:11:54,281
- Come on, let's walk.
<i>- Hold up.</i>

102
00:11:54,283 --> 00:11:56,834
Looks like a straight shot
if we follow the tracks.

103
00:11:56,836 --> 00:11:58,369
No.

104
00:11:58,371 --> 00:12:00,337
No tracks.
We'll take the road.

105
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:01,755
That's twice as far.

106
00:12:01,757 --> 00:12:04,425
Go whichever way you like.

107
00:12:04,427 --> 00:12:06,577
I ain't taking no tracks.

108
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:13,384
We should stick together.

109
00:12:30,044 --> 00:12:30,877
I see you've tied back

110
00:12:30,997 --> 00:12:32,237
your Tennessee waterfall there.

111
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,105
I won't lie. I liked it.

112
00:12:36,225 --> 00:12:37,704
I may very well miss it.

113
00:12:37,706 --> 00:12:39,673
The feeling of the billowy
curtain catching the breeze

114
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,676
some days was
straight-up bliss.

115
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,645
But brass tacks... the hair
doesn't make the man,

116
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:46,547
the man makes the man.

117
00:12:48,217 --> 00:12:52,886
Guard duty, weapons training,
changing up the hairstyle,

118
00:12:52,888 --> 00:12:56,423
swigging some swagger with
the ladies, spitting game...

119
00:12:56,425 --> 00:12:59,560
If you don't spit game,
you are game.

120
00:12:59,562 --> 00:13:02,062
Man seems to be changing.

121
00:13:02,064 --> 00:13:04,498
At least trying like hell to.

122
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:10,404
Makes me curious
what that's about.

123
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:13,040
It's simple, really.

124
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:16,176
As with any RPG, tabletop,
electronic, or otherwise,

125
00:13:16,178 --> 00:13:18,178
the key to survival
is allowing oneself

126
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,397
to be shaped by the
assigned environment.

127
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,900
In doing so, a broad range
of capabilities are acquired,

128
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,235
allowing one to flip the script
and use said capabilities

129
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:28,489
to shape said environment
for maximum longevity.

130
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:32,292
I'm saying I'm in the
process of said stage two.

131
00:13:32,294 --> 00:13:35,662
I've changed, adapted.
I'm a survivor.

132
00:13:41,337 --> 00:13:43,120
Keep telling yourself that.

133
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:48,792
I've changed, adapted.
I've become a survivor.

134
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:04,975
About time.

135
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,532
I didn't mean to pick him
over you back there.

136
00:14:11,534 --> 00:14:13,817
It's just...

137
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:16,620
You're holding it wrong.
Like this.

138
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,205
Thanks.

139
00:14:20,476 --> 00:14:22,776
Who taught you?

140
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,711
You know, how to fight?

141
00:14:26,382 --> 00:14:28,749
Sorry, I didn't mean
to bring up...

142
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:31,084
A lot of people
taught me a lot of things.

143
00:14:34,023 --> 00:14:37,591
Years from now, he'll just be a
name in a long list of names.

144
00:15:03,619 --> 00:15:05,285
All right, me and her
are gonna do this.

145
00:15:05,287 --> 00:15:06,703
You're gonna stay back, got it?

146
00:15:22,438 --> 00:15:24,304
Standard pin and tumbler.

147
00:15:24,306 --> 00:15:27,024
Tick-tick-click,
easy peasy.

148
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,775
This the place?

149
00:15:28,777 --> 00:15:30,360
It is indeed.

150
00:15:38,076 --> 00:15:39,325
Okay.

151
00:15:39,327 --> 00:15:41,077
You about ready
to spill the pintos

152
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:43,246
on what the hell it is
we're doing here?

153
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,333
Yeah.

154
00:15:47,335 --> 00:15:48,951
Eugene.

155
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:55,525
We're gonna
manufacture bullets here.

156
00:15:56,628 --> 00:15:58,061
<i>I've been chewing
the cud on this</i>

157
00:15:58,063 --> 00:15:59,929
<i>for a few days now.</i>

158
00:15:59,931 --> 00:16:02,765
<i>The Hilltop's dry,
our supply's finite.</i>

159
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:04,901
So not only are bullets
vital for defense,

160
00:16:04,903 --> 00:16:06,602
but per the law
of supply and demand,

161
00:16:06,604 --> 00:16:08,988
a full cartridge is now
the coin of the land.

162
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,023
Making bullets from scratch.

163
00:16:11,025 --> 00:16:14,277
Spent casings, but the
innards are all us.

164
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:16,779
And by us, I mean me.

165
00:16:16,781 --> 00:16:19,282
And you think you can do that...

166
00:16:19,284 --> 00:16:22,034
here?

167
00:16:22,036 --> 00:16:24,587
With just this?

168
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:27,123
Well, the digs will require
a thorough scrubbing.

169
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:32,211
We'll have to scare up a
hella ton of lead, but, yes.

170
00:16:32,213 --> 00:16:36,599
I most definitely almost certainly
think I can do that here.

171
00:16:36,601 --> 00:16:39,519
That, my friend,
is some damn fine

172
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:42,855
genuine outside-the-box
thinking.

173
00:16:46,444 --> 00:16:47,810
Where do we start?

174
00:16:47,812 --> 00:16:49,779
Well, we should inform Rick,
talk with Olivia,

175
00:16:49,781 --> 00:16:52,315
see what types of ammo would
be most valuable to produce.

176
00:16:52,317 --> 00:16:55,318
I'm gonna hit pause so I can
kill that thing behind you.

177
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,154
Pump your brakes, Red.

178
00:16:58,156 --> 00:17:00,072
I'm formally calling
dibs on this one.

179
00:17:02,043 --> 00:17:03,543
Dibs is dibs.

180
00:17:03,545 --> 00:17:05,878
Well, be my guest.

181
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,163
Get some.

182
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:11,501
Strike one.

183
00:17:17,775 --> 00:17:19,342
Strike two.

184
00:17:33,658 --> 00:17:35,908
Why did you...?

185
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,777
I called dibs.

186
00:17:40,498 --> 00:17:42,615
You had zero authority to...

187
00:17:42,617 --> 00:17:43,950
To what?

188
00:17:43,952 --> 00:17:45,201
Stop you from dying?

189
00:17:45,203 --> 00:17:46,769
I had full control
of the situation.

190
00:17:46,771 --> 00:17:50,540
You had better luck picking
up a turd by its clean end.

191
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:53,676
I'm gonna allow you to
apologize for saying that.

192
00:17:53,678 --> 00:17:55,211
So how about
you do so right now?

193
00:17:55,213 --> 00:17:59,382
Timmy down there almost
ate your face, dumbass.

194
00:17:59,384 --> 00:18:01,634
All due respect, screw you.

195
00:18:01,636 --> 00:18:02,935
Beg your pardon?

196
00:18:02,937 --> 00:18:05,188
Dispatching walkers
is well within my skill set,

197
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,889
so screw you
for suggesting otherwise.

198
00:18:06,891 --> 00:18:08,558
Let me get something
straight, all right?

199
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,394
Using your<i> cabeza,</i>
this whole DIY ammo thing,

200
00:18:11,396 --> 00:18:13,646
that is your damn skill set,

201
00:18:13,648 --> 00:18:15,314
just like ghosting hostiles,

202
00:18:15,316 --> 00:18:18,150
both of the undead and the
living variety, is mine.

203
00:18:18,152 --> 00:18:20,286
Now, you truly want to survive
this world long-term,

204
00:18:20,288 --> 00:18:22,572
I suggest you learn
that posthaste.

205
00:18:25,627 --> 00:18:26,959
Okay.

206
00:18:28,796 --> 00:18:31,347
Thank you for your protection.

207
00:18:31,349 --> 00:18:34,083
I most certainly needed it
between here and Houston.

208
00:18:34,085 --> 00:18:37,336
But your services
are no longer required.

209
00:18:37,338 --> 00:18:40,973
The truth, plain and honest.

210
00:18:40,975 --> 00:18:43,476
You've outlived
your usefulness to me.

211
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,396
Is that so?

212
00:18:47,398 --> 00:18:49,982
Plain and honest.

213
00:19:01,863 --> 00:19:03,829
- <i>Where are you going?</i>
- Home.

214
00:19:03,831 --> 00:19:08,284
My services
are no longer required.

215
00:19:09,704 --> 00:19:11,871
Find your own way back.

216
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,791
Asshole.

217
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,007
We gonna find out
what you had for breakfast?

218
00:19:48,644 --> 00:19:50,927
Oatmeal.

219
00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:52,729
Just so you know.

220
00:20:21,877 --> 00:20:24,094
Hey.

221
00:20:30,936 --> 00:20:33,553
You want me to hold
your bags, or...?

222
00:20:34,723 --> 00:20:36,189
Yeah.

223
00:21:03,135 --> 00:21:05,218
If you set 'em on the counter,
I can tell you which.

224
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,320
No, we're gonna take it all.

225
00:21:07,322 --> 00:21:09,055
Are you sure?
Because...

226
00:21:09,057 --> 00:21:10,974
No, it's fine.

227
00:21:25,524 --> 00:21:27,490
It's just one.

228
00:21:27,492 --> 00:21:28,908
It sounds like it's stuck.

229
00:23:09,761 --> 00:23:11,878
What the hell are you doing?

230
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,346
Nothing.

231
00:24:01,096 --> 00:24:02,979
Hey.

232
00:24:05,267 --> 00:24:08,017
You did good finding this place.

233
00:24:17,612 --> 00:24:19,946
Tried to tell you
you weren't ready.

234
00:24:19,948 --> 00:24:21,214
We both did.

235
00:24:21,216 --> 00:24:23,616
I know.

236
00:24:29,224 --> 00:24:32,292
So was he older or younger?

237
00:24:32,294 --> 00:24:34,794
Older.

238
00:24:34,796 --> 00:24:36,763
By six minutes.

239
00:24:38,517 --> 00:24:41,134
My parents came up with
the Dennis/Denise thing

240
00:24:41,136 --> 00:24:43,803
on one of their benders.

241
00:24:43,805 --> 00:24:45,471
Hilarious, right?

242
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:51,344
Nothing scared him.

243
00:24:51,346 --> 00:24:52,879
He was brave.

244
00:24:56,034 --> 00:24:58,151
He was angry, too.

245
00:24:59,387 --> 00:25:01,621
It's kind of
a dangerous combination.

246
00:25:02,824 --> 00:25:04,958
Sounds like we had
the same brother.

247
00:25:14,386 --> 00:25:16,102
Hey.

248
00:25:16,104 --> 00:25:18,838
This way's faster, right?

249
00:26:24,956 --> 00:26:27,240
There's a cooler in there!

250
00:26:27,242 --> 00:26:29,876
<i>Might be something
we can use inside.</i>

251
00:26:29,878 --> 00:26:31,377
We got what we came for.

252
00:26:31,379 --> 00:26:34,831
Nah, ain't worth
the trouble, come on.

253
00:27:15,623 --> 00:27:17,790
Shit.

254
00:27:24,849 --> 00:27:27,066
No, don't!

255
00:28:08,226 --> 00:28:10,109
Oh, man.

256
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,817
I threw up on my glasses.

257
00:28:36,955 --> 00:28:38,588
Hot damn.

258
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,373
What the hell was that?

259
00:28:42,377 --> 00:28:44,544
You could've died right
there, you know that?

260
00:28:44,546 --> 00:28:46,345
Yeah, I do.

261
00:28:46,347 --> 00:28:49,048
- Are you hearing me?
- <i>Who gives a shit?</i>

262
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:51,050
You could've died
killing those Saviors,

263
00:28:51,052 --> 00:28:54,137
both of you, but you didn't.

264
00:28:54,139 --> 00:28:56,105
You wanna live,
you take chances.

265
00:28:56,107 --> 00:28:57,974
That's how it works.

266
00:28:57,976 --> 00:29:00,326
That's what I did.

267
00:29:00,328 --> 00:29:01,944
For a couple of damn sodas?

268
00:29:01,946 --> 00:29:03,729
Nope.

269
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:06,699
Just this one.

270
00:29:15,543 --> 00:29:18,578
Are you seriously that stupid?

271
00:29:20,882 --> 00:29:22,632
Are you?

272
00:29:23,885 --> 00:29:27,053
I mean it.
Are you?

273
00:29:27,055 --> 00:29:31,123
Do you have any clue
what that was to me,

274
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:34,093
what this whole thing is to me?

275
00:29:34,095 --> 00:29:37,396
See, I have training
in this shit.

276
00:29:37,398 --> 00:29:39,015
I'm not making it up
as I go along,

277
00:29:39,017 --> 00:29:42,985
like with the stitches
and the surgery and the...

278
00:29:45,206 --> 00:29:48,774
I asked you to come with me because
you're brave like my brother

279
00:29:48,776 --> 00:29:50,993
and sometimes you actually
make me feel safe.

280
00:29:53,381 --> 00:29:56,115
And I wanted you here
because you're alone.

281
00:29:57,285 --> 00:30:00,086
Probably for the first
time in your life.

282
00:30:00,088 --> 00:30:02,355
<i>And because you're stronger
than you think you are,</i>

283
00:30:02,357 --> 00:30:05,124
<i>which gives me hope
that maybe I can be, too.</i>

284
00:30:10,598 --> 00:30:13,432
I could've gone with Tara.

285
00:30:13,434 --> 00:30:14,634
I could've told her I loved her,

286
00:30:14,636 --> 00:30:19,305
but I didn't
because I was afraid.

287
00:30:19,307 --> 00:30:21,641
That's what's stupid.

288
00:30:21,643 --> 00:30:25,862
Not coming out here,
not facing my shit.

289
00:30:25,864 --> 00:30:28,047
And it makes me sick

290
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:29,699
that you guys aren't even trying

291
00:30:29,701 --> 00:30:31,984
<i>because you're strong
and you're smart</i>

292
00:30:31,986 --> 00:30:33,986
and you're both
really good people,

293
00:30:33,988 --> 00:30:35,738
and if you don't wake...

294
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,324
up...

295
00:30:38,326 --> 00:30:41,377
and face your...

296
00:30:55,727 --> 00:30:57,977
You drop 'em now!

297
00:31:21,069 --> 00:31:22,752
Well, hell.

298
00:31:28,566 --> 00:31:31,902
You got something to say to me?

299
00:31:31,904 --> 00:31:33,904
<i>You gonna clear the air?</i>

300
00:31:33,906 --> 00:31:36,623
Step up on that high horse?

301
00:31:37,793 --> 00:31:39,459
<i>No.</i>

302
00:31:39,461 --> 00:31:41,945
You don't talk much.

303
00:31:57,229 --> 00:31:59,162
Still getting the hang of her.

304
00:32:03,302 --> 00:32:05,068
Kicks like a bitch, but...

305
00:32:05,103 --> 00:32:07,837
- I should've done it.
- <i>Oh, what's that?</i>

306
00:32:10,158 --> 00:32:12,475
Seriously, I didn't
catch what you said.

307
00:32:12,511 --> 00:32:14,811
I should've killed you.

308
00:32:16,548 --> 00:32:18,315
Yeah, you probably should've.

309
00:32:20,786 --> 00:32:23,320
<i>So, here we are.</i>

310
00:32:23,355 --> 00:32:25,822
<i>Kind of begs
the question, right?</i>

311
00:32:25,857 --> 00:32:29,209
Who brought this on who?

312
00:32:29,261 --> 00:32:34,097
<i>I mean, I get that you'll just have
to take my word for this, but...</i>

313
00:32:35,434 --> 00:32:38,101
she wasn't even the one
I was aiming for.

314
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:43,773
Like I said, kicks like a bitch.

315
00:32:44,776 --> 00:32:47,527
It's nothing personal.

316
00:32:47,563 --> 00:32:51,348
Look, this isn't how we like to
start new business arrangements,

317
00:32:51,383 --> 00:32:54,451
but, well, you pricks kind
of set the tone, didn't you?

318
00:32:54,486 --> 00:32:56,036
What do you want?

319
00:32:56,071 --> 00:32:58,521
<i>I'm sorry, darlin', I
didn't catch your name.</i>

320
00:32:58,557 --> 00:33:01,408
I'm D, or Dwight.

321
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,227
You can call me either.

322
00:33:04,263 --> 00:33:06,830
So?

323
00:33:06,882 --> 00:33:08,531
What's your name?

324
00:33:08,567 --> 00:33:11,501
Rosita.
What do you want?

325
00:33:11,553 --> 00:33:14,387
Well, Rosita...

326
00:33:14,423 --> 00:33:17,057
it's not what I want.

327
00:33:17,092 --> 00:33:20,260
It's what you and Daryl
are going to do.

328
00:33:20,312 --> 00:33:22,929
You're going to let us
into your little complex.

329
00:33:22,981 --> 00:33:26,316
<i>It looks like it's just
beautiful in there.</i>

330
00:33:26,351 --> 00:33:29,219
<i>And then you're going
to let us take whatever</i>

331
00:33:29,254 --> 00:33:31,821
and whoever we want...

332
00:33:33,575 --> 00:33:36,493
or we blow Eugene's brains out.

333
00:33:36,528 --> 00:33:38,228
<i>And then yours.</i>

334
00:33:38,263 --> 00:33:40,463
And then his.

335
00:33:40,499 --> 00:33:44,034
<i>I hope it doesn't
come to that, really.</i>

336
00:33:44,086 --> 00:33:46,036
<i>Nobody else has to die.</i>

337
00:33:46,071 --> 00:33:49,539
We just try and start with one.

338
00:33:49,574 --> 00:33:51,708
You know...

339
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,011
maximum impact
to get our point across.

340
00:33:55,047 --> 00:33:58,748
<i>So what's it gonna be?
You tell me.</i>

341
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:02,085
You wanna kill someone,
you start with our companion

342
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,221
<i>hiding over there
behind the oil barrels.</i>

343
00:34:05,223 --> 00:34:08,458
He's a first-class a-hole and he
deserves it so much more than us three.

344
00:34:16,151 --> 00:34:17,400
Go check it out.

345
00:35:27,472 --> 00:35:30,273
Fall back!
Fall back!

346
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,430

How is he?

355
00:37:19,743 --> 00:37:20,813
Bullet just grazed him,

356
00:37:20,933 --> 00:37:23,128
but it's a good thing we
got him back when we did.

357
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:26,900
<i>Antibiotics we picked up could
save him from an infection.</i>

358
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,219
<i>Could save his life.</i>

359
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:30,763
<i>That's what Denise did.</i>

360
00:37:33,707 --> 00:37:36,208
You here?

361
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,593
Present.

362
00:37:38,595 --> 00:37:40,178
Good.

363
00:37:42,549 --> 00:37:46,301
I was not trying to kill you.

364
00:37:46,303 --> 00:37:48,103
I was looking for a moment.

365
00:37:48,105 --> 00:37:51,139
You found it.

366
00:37:51,141 --> 00:37:55,560
Do you apologize
for questioning my skills?

367
00:37:55,562 --> 00:37:59,531
I apologize
for questioning your skills.

368
00:37:59,533 --> 00:38:02,284
You know how to bite
a dick, Eugene.

369
00:38:02,286 --> 00:38:04,987
I mean that
with the utmost of respect.

370
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:07,873
Welcome to stage two.

371
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:10,659
Don't need to welcome me.

372
00:38:10,661 --> 00:38:12,995
I've been here a while.

373
00:38:35,736 --> 00:38:38,570
I just heard.

374
00:38:38,572 --> 00:38:40,972
You okay?

375
00:38:41,975 --> 00:38:44,042
<i>You said I had choices.</i>

376
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,246
You have them, too.

377
00:38:51,151 --> 00:38:53,485
<i>Could be 30 years for us here.</i>

378
00:38:58,125 --> 00:39:00,025
That's still too short.

379
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,107
Come inside.

380
00:40:13,367 --> 00:40:15,867
You were right.

381
00:40:15,869 --> 00:40:17,869
I knew it when you said it.

382
00:40:32,085 --> 00:40:34,286
<i>I wish
it didn't have to end,</i>

383
00:40:34,288 --> 00:40:36,988
<i>not this way.</i>

384
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:40,458
<i>It was never my intention
to hurt you,</i>

385
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:43,295
<i>but it's how it has to be.</i>

386
00:40:43,297 --> 00:40:45,730
<i>We have so much here...</i>

387
00:40:45,732 --> 00:40:49,951
<i>people, food, medicine, walls,</i>

388
00:40:49,953 --> 00:40:52,204
<i>everything we need to live.</i>

389
00:40:54,324 --> 00:40:58,076
<i>But what we have
other people want, too,</i>

390
00:40:58,078 --> 00:41:00,245
<i>and that will never change.</i>

391
00:41:02,583 --> 00:41:04,416
<i>If we survive this threat
and it's not over,</i>

392
00:41:04,418 --> 00:41:06,334
<i>another one will be back
to take its place,</i>

393
00:41:06,336 --> 00:41:08,253
<i>to take what we have.</i>

394
00:41:12,092 --> 00:41:14,342
<i>I love you all here.</i>

395
00:41:14,344 --> 00:41:16,428
<i>I do.</i>

396
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:19,064
<i>And I'd have to kill for you.</i>

397
00:41:19,066 --> 00:41:21,566
<i>And I can't.</i>

398
00:41:21,568 --> 00:41:23,185
<i>I won't.</i>

399
00:41:33,747 --> 00:41:36,214
<i>Rick sent me away and I
wasn't ever gonna come back,</i>

400
00:41:36,216 --> 00:41:39,050
<i>but everything happened
and I wound up staying.</i>

401
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:45,957
<i>But I can't anymore.</i>

402
00:41:45,959 --> 00:41:49,261
<i>I can't love anyone because
I can't kill for anyone.</i>

403
00:41:55,002 --> 00:41:57,552
<i>So I'm going,
like I always should have.</i>

404
00:42:01,327 --> 00:42:04,442
<i>Don't come after me, please.</i>

405
00:42:26,936 --> 00:42:34,936
