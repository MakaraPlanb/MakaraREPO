<i>Previously on
AMC's "The Walking Dead..."</i>

2
00:00:04,208 --> 00:00:06,758
<i>I'd like to get
to know you a whole lot better.</i>

3
00:00:06,877 --> 00:00:08,877
What makes you think...

4
00:00:08,962 --> 00:00:10,378
I want that?

5
00:00:10,464 --> 00:00:12,180
- <i>Right behind you.</i>
- You don't have to.

6
00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:13,682
No one gets to clock out today.

7
00:00:15,436 --> 00:00:17,385
It's a way out,
for them and for us.

8
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:19,805
<i>Where there's life,
there's possibility.</i>

9
00:00:21,024 --> 00:00:22,024
I'm leaving.

10
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:22,941
You are not walking
out that door

11
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,609
unless you can tell me why.

12
00:00:26,313 --> 00:00:28,280
- <i>Hi, you good?</i>
- No.

13
00:01:53,817 --> 00:01:55,250
Morgan?

14
00:01:59,656 --> 00:02:01,756
Wh-- why?

15
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,631
It'll give you
some choices next time.

16
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:17,175
Didn't even notice.

17
00:04:17,177 --> 00:04:19,177
Got your bike back.

18
00:04:19,179 --> 00:04:21,329
Yeah.

19
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:25,050
You got another one of those?

20
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:33,058
Thanks.

21
00:04:40,817 --> 00:04:45,236
Those people you met, the ones in the
burnt forest, they took it from you?

22
00:04:45,238 --> 00:04:47,155
Yeah.

23
00:04:49,993 --> 00:04:51,876
You saved them, right?

24
00:04:55,382 --> 00:04:56,831
Sorry.

25
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,333
It's who you are.

26
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:03,004
We're still stuck with that.

27
00:05:03,006 --> 00:05:05,173
No, we ain't.

28
00:05:05,175 --> 00:05:06,508
I should've killed them.

29
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,626
Hey.

30
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,697
<i>The ones that took
you and Maggie...</i>

31
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:32,117
what'd they do to you?

32
00:05:37,073 --> 00:05:38,673
To us?

33
00:05:38,675 --> 00:05:40,742
They didn't do anything.

34
00:06:45,966 --> 00:06:56,275
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny

35
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,104
So, if you didn't
already have plans,

36
00:07:33,224 --> 00:07:35,076
I was thinking of making
my beef jerky stroganoff.

37
00:07:35,174 --> 00:07:37,374
I'm good, thanks.

38
00:07:37,376 --> 00:07:38,942
It's not exactly
a nice porterhouse,

39
00:07:38,944 --> 00:07:40,811
but I promise it's better
than it sounds.

40
00:07:40,813 --> 00:07:42,863
I'm sure it is.

41
00:07:44,783 --> 00:07:46,817
What?

42
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:48,652
What are we doing?

43
00:07:50,906 --> 00:07:53,290
Just tell me.
It's good either way.

44
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:54,991
It really is.

45
00:07:57,863 --> 00:07:59,596
Okay.

46
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:02,399
- Okay is what we're doing?
- We'll do dinner.

47
00:08:02,401 --> 00:08:04,067
Okay?

48
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:05,735
All right.

49
00:08:07,806 --> 00:08:09,339
See you then.

50
00:08:09,341 --> 00:08:11,441
Okay.

51
00:08:12,778 --> 00:08:16,246
I didn't hear you guys.

52
00:08:16,248 --> 00:08:17,848
Good.

53
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,766
Today's lesson will be
in the cul-de-sac.

54
00:08:19,768 --> 00:08:23,437
Actually, can we do
something else?

55
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,722
After I got out
of DC, I just drove.

56
00:08:25,724 --> 00:08:28,959
I remember seeing it right when I
realized I had no idea where I was going.

57
00:08:28,961 --> 00:08:32,195
Edison's Apothecary
and Boutique.

58
00:08:32,197 --> 00:08:35,398
It's just this little
gift shop in a strip mall,

59
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,034
but if it's really
an apothecary,

60
00:08:38,036 --> 00:08:39,836
they had drugs.

61
00:08:39,838 --> 00:08:42,339
<i>How do you know
they still got 'em?</i>

62
00:08:42,341 --> 00:08:45,041
It isn't that far.
I just wanna check.

63
00:08:45,043 --> 00:08:48,428
And you and Rosita aren't out
scavenging or pulling shifts.

64
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,013
We'll go.

65
00:08:50,015 --> 00:08:52,632
I wanted to check.

66
00:08:52,634 --> 00:08:54,985
I just wanted to help.

67
00:08:54,987 --> 00:08:57,971
How much time
you spend out there?

68
00:08:57,973 --> 00:08:59,689
- None.
- Forget it.

69
00:08:59,691 --> 00:09:02,459
I can ID the meds. I know
how to use a machete now.

70
00:09:02,461 --> 00:09:04,227
I've seen roamers up close.

71
00:09:04,229 --> 00:09:05,462
I'm ready.

72
00:09:05,464 --> 00:09:08,331
- You good with this?
- No.

73
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,799
I'll go alone, if I have to.

74
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:11,234
You'll die alone.

75
00:09:11,236 --> 00:09:13,336
I'm asking you
to make sure I don't.

76
00:09:16,475 --> 00:09:19,409
I'm not babysitting her
by myself.

77
00:09:35,844 --> 00:09:38,845
It-- the...

78
00:09:38,847 --> 00:09:40,564
What?

79
00:09:40,566 --> 00:09:41,982
Forget it.

80
00:09:41,984 --> 00:09:46,069
No, what?

81
00:09:46,071 --> 00:09:50,273
I think maybe you're
disengaging it too soon.

82
00:09:50,275 --> 00:09:52,375
I've been driving stick
since I was 15,

83
00:09:52,377 --> 00:09:55,679
usually beat-up trucks
like this.

84
00:09:55,681 --> 00:09:58,114
I mean, before-- you know,
before I left home.

85
00:10:03,322 --> 00:10:06,289
My brother taught me,
so I just know.

86
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,302
Daryl.

87
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:22,722
Yep.

88
00:10:30,182 --> 00:10:31,948
Stay here.

89
00:10:49,418 --> 00:10:51,001
I got it.

90
00:11:04,566 --> 00:11:07,350
This happened fast.

91
00:11:07,352 --> 00:11:09,519
Tree rotted out.
It wasn't people.

92
00:11:30,275 --> 00:11:32,542
Come on, it's clear.

93
00:11:35,047 --> 00:11:36,346
What'd you find?

94
00:11:36,348 --> 00:11:39,049
Bottles of booze.
Any takers?

95
00:11:39,051 --> 00:11:40,383
No, thanks.

96
00:11:40,385 --> 00:11:42,268
For later.
I'm not bringing these to the pantry.

97
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,687
I'm good.

98
00:11:43,689 --> 00:11:46,389
They were kind of
my parents' thing.

99
00:11:46,391 --> 00:11:48,608
Which is why they aren't mine.

100
00:11:50,896 --> 00:11:52,696
That truck ain't gonna
make it past this tree.

101
00:11:52,698 --> 00:11:54,981
- Come on, let's walk.
<i>- Hold up.</i>

102
00:11:54,983 --> 00:11:57,534
Looks like a straight shot
if we follow the tracks.

103
00:11:57,536 --> 00:11:59,069
No.

104
00:11:59,071 --> 00:12:01,037
No tracks.
We'll take the road.

105
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:02,455
That's twice as far.

106
00:12:02,457 --> 00:12:05,125
Go whichever way you like.

107
00:12:05,127 --> 00:12:07,277
I ain't taking no tracks.

108
00:12:12,117 --> 00:12:14,084
We should stick together.

109
00:12:30,744 --> 00:12:31,577
I see you've tied back

110
00:12:31,697 --> 00:12:32,937
your Tennessee waterfall there.

111
00:12:34,703 --> 00:12:36,805
I won't lie. I liked it.

112
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:38,404
I may very well miss it.

113
00:12:38,406 --> 00:12:40,373
The feeling of the billowy
curtain catching the breeze

114
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:43,376
some days was
straight-up bliss.

115
00:12:43,378 --> 00:12:45,345
But brass tacks-- the hair
doesn't make the man,

116
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,247
the man makes the man.

117
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:53,586
Guard duty, weapons training,
changing up the hairstyle,

118
00:12:53,588 --> 00:12:57,123
swigging some swagger with
the ladies, spitting game--

119
00:12:57,125 --> 00:13:00,260
If you don't spit game,
you are game.

120
00:13:00,262 --> 00:13:02,762
Man seems to be changing.

121
00:13:02,764 --> 00:13:05,198
At least trying like hell to.

122
00:13:06,801 --> 00:13:11,104
Makes me curious
what that's about.

123
00:13:12,274 --> 00:13:13,740
It's simple, really.

124
00:13:13,742 --> 00:13:16,876
As with any RPG, tabletop,
electronic, or otherwise,

125
00:13:16,878 --> 00:13:18,878
the key to survival
is allowing oneself

126
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,097
to be shaped by the
assigned environment.

127
00:13:21,099 --> 00:13:23,600
In doing so, a broad range
of capabilities are acquired,

128
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,935
allowing one to flip the script
and use said capabilities

129
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:29,189
to shape said environment
for maximum longevity.

130
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:32,992
I'm saying I'm in the
process of said stage two.

131
00:13:32,994 --> 00:13:36,362
I've changed, adapted.
I'm a survivor.

132
00:13:42,037 --> 00:13:43,820
Keep telling yourself that.

133
00:13:46,124 --> 00:13:49,492
I've changed, adapted.
I've become a survivor.

134
00:14:03,892 --> 00:14:05,675
About time.

135
00:14:09,681 --> 00:14:12,232
I didn't mean to pick him
over you back there.

136
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:14,517
It's just...

137
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,320
You're holding it wrong.
Like this.

138
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:18,905
Thanks.

139
00:14:21,176 --> 00:14:23,476
Who taught you?

140
00:14:23,478 --> 00:14:25,411
You know, how to fight?

141
00:14:27,082 --> 00:14:29,449
Sorry, I didn't mean
to bring up...

142
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,784
A lot of people
taught me a lot of things.

143
00:14:34,723 --> 00:14:38,291
Years from now, he'll just be a
name in a long list of names.

144
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:05,985
All right, me and her
are gonna do this.

145
00:15:05,987 --> 00:15:07,403
You're gonna stay back, got it?

146
00:15:23,138 --> 00:15:25,004
Standard pin and tumbler.

147
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:27,724
Tick-tick-click,
easy peasy.

148
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,475
This the place?

149
00:15:29,477 --> 00:15:31,060
It is indeed.

150
00:15:38,776 --> 00:15:40,025
Okay.

151
00:15:40,027 --> 00:15:41,777
You about ready
to spill the pintos

152
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:43,946
on what the hell it is
we're doing here?

153
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,033
Yeah.

154
00:15:48,035 --> 00:15:49,651
Eugene.

155
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,225
We're gonna
manufacture bullets here.

156
00:15:57,328 --> 00:15:58,761
<i>I've been chewing
the cud on this</i>

157
00:15:58,763 --> 00:16:00,629
<i>for a few days now.</i>

158
00:16:00,631 --> 00:16:03,465
<i>The Hilltop's dry,
our supply's finite.</i>

159
00:16:03,467 --> 00:16:05,601
So not only are bullets
vital for defense,

160
00:16:05,603 --> 00:16:07,302
but per the law
of supply and demand,

161
00:16:07,304 --> 00:16:09,688
a full cartridge is now
the coin of the land.

162
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,723
Making bullets from scratch.

163
00:16:11,725 --> 00:16:14,977
Spent casings, but the
innards are all us.

164
00:16:14,979 --> 00:16:17,479
And by us, I mean me.

165
00:16:17,481 --> 00:16:19,982
And you think you can do that...

166
00:16:19,984 --> 00:16:22,734
here?

167
00:16:22,736 --> 00:16:25,287
With just this?

168
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:27,823
Well, the digs will require
a thorough scrubbing.

169
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,911
We'll have to scare up a
hella ton of lead, but, yes.

170
00:16:32,913 --> 00:16:37,299
I most definitely almost certainly
think I can do that here.

171
00:16:37,301 --> 00:16:40,219
That, my friend,
is some damn fine

172
00:16:40,221 --> 00:16:43,555
genuine outside-the-box
thinking.

173
00:16:47,144 --> 00:16:48,510
Where do we start?

174
00:16:48,512 --> 00:16:50,479
Well, we should inform Rick,
talk with Olivia,

175
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:53,015
see what types of ammo would
be most valuable to produce.

176
00:16:53,017 --> 00:16:56,018
I'm gonna hit pause so I can
kill that thing behind you.

177
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,854
Pump your brakes, Red.

178
00:16:58,856 --> 00:17:00,772
I'm formally calling
dibs on this one.

179
00:17:02,743 --> 00:17:04,243
Dibs is dibs.

180
00:17:04,245 --> 00:17:06,578
Well, be my guest.

181
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,863
Get some.

182
00:17:10,451 --> 00:17:12,201
Strike one.

183
00:17:18,475 --> 00:17:20,042
Strike two.

184
00:17:34,358 --> 00:17:36,608
Why did you--?

185
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,477
I called dibs.

186
00:17:41,198 --> 00:17:43,315
You had zero
authority to--

187
00:17:43,317 --> 00:17:44,650
To what?

188
00:17:44,652 --> 00:17:45,901
Stop you from dying?

189
00:17:45,903 --> 00:17:47,469
I had full control
of the situation.

190
00:17:47,471 --> 00:17:51,240
You had better luck picking
up a turd by its clean end.

191
00:17:51,242 --> 00:17:54,376
I'm gonna allow you to
apologize for saying that.

192
00:17:54,378 --> 00:17:55,911
So how about
you do so right now?

193
00:17:55,913 --> 00:18:00,082
Timmy down there almost
ate your face, dumbass.

194
00:18:00,084 --> 00:18:02,334
All due respect, screw you.

195
00:18:02,336 --> 00:18:03,635
Beg your pardon?

196
00:18:03,637 --> 00:18:05,888
Dispatching walkers
is well within my skill set,

197
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,589
so screw you
for suggesting otherwise.

198
00:18:07,591 --> 00:18:09,258
Let me get something
straight, all right?

199
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,094
Using your<i> cabeza,</i>
this whole DIY ammo thing,

200
00:18:12,096 --> 00:18:14,346
that is your damn skill set,

201
00:18:14,348 --> 00:18:16,014
just like ghosting hostiles,

202
00:18:16,016 --> 00:18:18,850
both of the undead and the
living variety, is mine.

203
00:18:18,852 --> 00:18:20,986
Now, you truly want to survive
this world long-term,

204
00:18:20,988 --> 00:18:23,272
I suggest you learn
that posthaste.

205
00:18:26,327 --> 00:18:27,659
Okay.

206
00:18:29,496 --> 00:18:32,047
Thank you for your protection.

207
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:34,783
I most certainly needed it
between here and Houston.

208
00:18:34,785 --> 00:18:38,036
But your services
are no longer required.

209
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:41,673
The truth, plain and honest.

210
00:18:41,675 --> 00:18:44,176
You've outlived
your usefulness to me.

211
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,096
Is that so?

212
00:18:48,098 --> 00:18:50,682
Plain and honest.

213
00:19:02,563 --> 00:19:04,529
-<i> Where are you going?</i>
- Home.

214
00:19:04,531 --> 00:19:08,984
My services
are no longer required.

215
00:19:10,404 --> 00:19:12,571
Find your own way back.

216
00:19:14,658 --> 00:19:16,491
Asshole.

217
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,107
We gonna find out
what you had for breakfast?

218
00:19:49,744 --> 00:19:52,027
Oatmeal.

219
00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:53,829
Just so you know.

220
00:20:22,977 --> 00:20:25,194
Hey.

221
00:20:32,036 --> 00:20:34,653
You want me to hold
your bags, or...?

222
00:20:35,823 --> 00:20:37,289
Yeah.

223
00:21:04,235 --> 00:21:06,318
If you set 'em on the counter,
I can tell you which.

224
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,420
No, we're gonna take it all.

225
00:21:08,422 --> 00:21:10,155
Are you sure?
Because--

226
00:21:10,157 --> 00:21:12,074
No, it's fine.

227
00:21:26,624 --> 00:21:28,590
It's just one.

228
00:21:28,592 --> 00:21:30,008
It sounds like it's stuck.

229
00:23:10,861 --> 00:23:12,978
What the hell are you doing?

230
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,446
Nothing.

231
00:24:02,196 --> 00:24:04,079
Hey.

232
00:24:06,367 --> 00:24:09,117
You did good finding this place.

233
00:24:18,712 --> 00:24:21,046
Tried to tell you
you weren't ready.

234
00:24:21,048 --> 00:24:22,314
We both did.

235
00:24:22,316 --> 00:24:24,716
I know.

236
00:24:30,324 --> 00:24:33,392
So was he older or younger?

237
00:24:33,394 --> 00:24:35,894
Older.

238
00:24:35,896 --> 00:24:37,863
By six minutes.

239
00:24:39,617 --> 00:24:42,234
My parents came up with
the Dennis/Denise thing

240
00:24:42,236 --> 00:24:44,903
on one of their benders.

241
00:24:44,905 --> 00:24:46,571
Hilarious, right?

242
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:52,444
Nothing scared him.

243
00:24:52,446 --> 00:24:53,979
He was brave.

244
00:24:57,134 --> 00:24:59,251
He was angry, too.

245
00:25:00,487 --> 00:25:02,721
It's kind of
a dangerous combination.

246
00:25:03,924 --> 00:25:06,058
Sounds like we had
the same brother.

247
00:25:15,486 --> 00:25:17,202
Hey.

248
00:25:17,204 --> 00:25:19,938
This way's faster, right?

249
00:26:26,056 --> 00:26:28,340
There's a cooler in there!

250
00:26:28,342 --> 00:26:30,976
<i>Might be something
we can use inside.</i>

251
00:26:30,978 --> 00:26:32,477
We got what we came for.

252
00:26:32,479 --> 00:26:35,931
Nah, ain't worth
the trouble, come on.

253
00:27:16,723 --> 00:27:18,890
Shit.

254
00:27:25,949 --> 00:27:28,166
No, don't!

255
00:28:09,326 --> 00:28:11,209
Oh, man.

256
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:18,917
I threw up on my glasses.

257
00:28:38,055 --> 00:28:39,688
Hot damn.

258
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,473
What the hell was that?

259
00:28:43,477 --> 00:28:45,644
You could've died right
there, you know that?

260
00:28:45,646 --> 00:28:47,445
Yeah, I do.

261
00:28:47,447 --> 00:28:50,148
- Are you hearing me?
-<i> Who gives a shit?</i>

262
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,150
You could've died
killing those Saviors,

263
00:28:52,152 --> 00:28:55,237
both of you, but you didn't.

264
00:28:55,239 --> 00:28:57,205
You wanna live,
you take chances.

265
00:28:57,207 --> 00:28:59,074
That's how it works.

266
00:28:59,076 --> 00:29:01,426
That's what I did.

267
00:29:01,428 --> 00:29:03,044
For a couple of damn sodas?

268
00:29:03,046 --> 00:29:04,829
Nope.

269
00:29:05,933 --> 00:29:07,799
Just this one.

270
00:29:16,643 --> 00:29:19,678
Are you seriously that stupid?

271
00:29:21,982 --> 00:29:23,732
Are you?

272
00:29:24,985 --> 00:29:28,153
I mean it.
Are you?

273
00:29:28,155 --> 00:29:32,223
Do you have any clue
what that was to me,

274
00:29:32,225 --> 00:29:35,193
what this whole thing is to me?

275
00:29:35,195 --> 00:29:38,496
See, I have training
in this shit.

276
00:29:38,498 --> 00:29:40,115
I'm not making it up
as I go along,

277
00:29:40,117 --> 00:29:44,085
like with the stitches
and the surgery and the...

278
00:29:46,306 --> 00:29:49,874
I asked you to come with me because
you're brave like my brother

279
00:29:49,876 --> 00:29:52,093
and sometimes you actually
make me feel safe.

280
00:29:54,481 --> 00:29:57,215
And I wanted you here
because you're alone.

281
00:29:58,385 --> 00:30:01,186
Probably for the first
time in your life.

282
00:30:01,188 --> 00:30:03,455
<i>And because you're stronger
than you think you are,</i>

283
00:30:03,457 --> 00:30:06,224
<i>which gives me hope
that maybe I can be, too.</i>

284
00:30:11,698 --> 00:30:14,532
I could've gone with Tara.

285
00:30:14,534 --> 00:30:15,734
I could've told her I loved her,

286
00:30:15,736 --> 00:30:20,405
but I didn't
because I was afraid.

287
00:30:20,407 --> 00:30:22,741
That's what's stupid.

288
00:30:22,743 --> 00:30:26,962
Not coming out here,
not facing my shit.

289
00:30:26,964 --> 00:30:29,147
And it makes me sick

290
00:30:29,149 --> 00:30:30,799
that you guys aren't even trying

291
00:30:30,801 --> 00:30:33,084
<i>because you're strong
and you're smart</i>

292
00:30:33,086 --> 00:30:35,086
and you're both
really good people,

293
00:30:35,088 --> 00:30:36,838
and if you don't wake...

294
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,424
up...

295
00:30:39,426 --> 00:30:42,477
and face your...

296
00:30:56,827 --> 00:30:59,077
You drop 'em now!

297
00:31:22,169 --> 00:31:23,852
Well, hell.

298
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:33,002
You got something to say to me?

299
00:31:33,004 --> 00:31:35,004
<i>You gonna clear the air?</i>

300
00:31:35,006 --> 00:31:37,723
Step up on that high horse?

301
00:31:38,893 --> 00:31:40,559
<i>No.</i>

302
00:31:40,561 --> 00:31:43,045
You don't talk much.

303
00:31:58,329 --> 00:32:00,262
Still getting the hang of her.

304
00:32:04,402 --> 00:32:06,168
Kicks like a bitch, but--

305
00:32:06,203 --> 00:32:08,937
- I should've done it.
-<i> Oh, what's that?</i>

306
00:32:11,258 --> 00:32:13,575
Seriously, I didn't
catch what you said.

307
00:32:13,611 --> 00:32:15,911
I should've killed you.

308
00:32:17,648 --> 00:32:19,415
Yeah, you probably should've.

309
00:32:21,886 --> 00:32:24,420
<i>So, here we are.</i>

310
00:32:24,455 --> 00:32:26,922
<i>Kind of begs
the question, right?</i>

311
00:32:26,957 --> 00:32:30,309
Who brought this on who?

312
00:32:30,361 --> 00:32:35,197
<i>I mean, I get that you'll just have
to take my word for this, but...</i>

313
00:32:36,534 --> 00:32:39,201
she wasn't even the one
I was aiming for.

314
00:32:40,571 --> 00:32:44,873
Like I said, kicks like a bitch.

315
00:32:45,876 --> 00:32:48,627
It's nothing personal.

316
00:32:48,663 --> 00:32:52,448
Look, this isn't how we like to
start new business arrangements,

317
00:32:52,483 --> 00:32:55,551
but, well, you pricks kind
of set the tone, didn't you?

318
00:32:55,586 --> 00:32:57,136
What do you want?

319
00:32:57,171 --> 00:32:59,621
<i>I'm sorry, darlin', I
didn't catch your name.</i>

320
00:32:59,657 --> 00:33:02,508
I'm D, or Dwight.

321
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,327
You can call me either.

322
00:33:05,363 --> 00:33:07,930
So?

323
00:33:07,982 --> 00:33:09,631
What's your name?

324
00:33:09,667 --> 00:33:12,601
Rosita.
What do you want?

325
00:33:12,653 --> 00:33:15,487
Well, Rosita...

326
00:33:15,523 --> 00:33:18,157
it's not what I want.

327
00:33:18,192 --> 00:33:21,360
It's what you and Daryl
are going to do.

328
00:33:21,412 --> 00:33:24,029
You're going to let us
into your little complex.

329
00:33:24,081 --> 00:33:27,416
<i>It looks like it's just
beautiful in there.</i>

330
00:33:27,451 --> 00:33:30,319
<i>And then you're going
to let us take whatever</i>

331
00:33:30,354 --> 00:33:32,921
and whoever we want...

332
00:33:34,675 --> 00:33:37,593
or we blow Eugene's brains out.

333
00:33:37,628 --> 00:33:39,328
<i>And then yours.</i>

334
00:33:39,363 --> 00:33:41,563
And then his.

335
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:45,134
<i>I hope it doesn't
come to that, really.</i>

336
00:33:45,186 --> 00:33:47,136
<i>Nobody else has to die.</i>

337
00:33:47,171 --> 00:33:50,639
We just try and start with one.

338
00:33:50,674 --> 00:33:52,808
You know...

339
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:56,111
maximum impact
to get our point across.

340
00:33:56,147 --> 00:33:59,848
<i>So what's it gonna be?
You tell me.</i>

341
00:33:59,884 --> 00:34:03,185
You wanna kill someone,
you start with our companion

342
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:06,321
<i>hiding over there
behind the oil barrels.</i>

343
00:34:06,323 --> 00:34:09,558
He's a first-class a-hole and he
deserves it so much more than us three.

344
00:34:17,251 --> 00:34:18,500
Go check it out.

345
00:35:28,572 --> 00:35:31,373
Fall back!
Fall back!

346
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,530

How is he?

355
00:37:21,943 --> 00:37:23,013
Bullet just grazed him,

356
00:37:23,133 --> 00:37:25,328
but it's a good thing we
got him back when we did.

357
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:29,100
<i>Antibiotics we picked up could
save him from an infection.</i>

358
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,419
<i>Could save his life.</i>

359
00:37:31,539 --> 00:37:32,963
<i>That's what Denise did.</i>

360
00:37:35,907 --> 00:37:38,408
You here?

361
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:40,793
Present.

362
00:37:40,795 --> 00:37:42,378
Good.

363
00:37:44,749 --> 00:37:48,501
I was not trying to kill you.

364
00:37:48,503 --> 00:37:50,303
I was looking for a moment.

365
00:37:50,305 --> 00:37:53,339
You found it.

366
00:37:53,341 --> 00:37:57,760
Do you apologize
for questioning my skills?

367
00:37:57,762 --> 00:38:01,731
I apologize
for questioning your skills.

368
00:38:01,733 --> 00:38:04,484
You know how to bite
a dick, Eugene.

369
00:38:04,486 --> 00:38:07,187
I mean that
with the utmost of respect.

370
00:38:07,189 --> 00:38:10,073
Welcome to stage two.

371
00:38:10,075 --> 00:38:12,859
Don't need to welcome me.

372
00:38:12,861 --> 00:38:15,195
I've been here a while.

373
00:38:37,936 --> 00:38:40,770
I just heard.

374
00:38:40,772 --> 00:38:43,172
You okay?

375
00:38:44,175 --> 00:38:46,242
<i>You said I had choices.</i>

376
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,446
You have them, too.

377
00:38:53,351 --> 00:38:55,685
<i>Could be 30 years for us here.</i>

378
00:39:00,325 --> 00:39:02,225
That's still too short.

379
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,307
Come inside.

380
00:40:15,567 --> 00:40:18,067
You were right.

381
00:40:18,069 --> 00:40:20,069
I knew it when you said it.

382
00:40:34,285 --> 00:40:36,486
<i>I wish
it didn't have to end,</i>

383
00:40:36,488 --> 00:40:39,188
<i>not this way.</i>

384
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:42,658
<i>It was never my intention
to hurt you,</i>

385
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,495
<i>but it's how it has to be.</i>

386
00:40:45,497 --> 00:40:47,930
<i>We have so much here--</i>

387
00:40:47,932 --> 00:40:52,151
<i>people, food, medicine, walls,</i>

388
00:40:52,153 --> 00:40:54,404
<i>everything we need to live.</i>

389
00:40:56,524 --> 00:41:00,276
<i>But what we have
other people want, too,</i>

390
00:41:00,278 --> 00:41:02,445
<i>and that will never change.</i>

391
00:41:04,783 --> 00:41:06,616
<i>If we survive this threat
and it's not over,</i>

392
00:41:06,618 --> 00:41:08,534
<i>another one will be back
to take its place,</i>

393
00:41:08,536 --> 00:41:10,453
<i>to take what we have.</i>

394
00:41:14,292 --> 00:41:16,542
<i>I love you all here.</i>

395
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,628
<i>I do.</i>

396
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:21,264
<i>And I'd have to kill for you.</i>

397
00:41:21,266 --> 00:41:23,766
<i>And I can't.</i>

398
00:41:23,768 --> 00:41:25,385
<i>I won't.</i>

399
00:41:35,947 --> 00:41:38,414
<i>Rick sent me away and I
wasn't ever gonna come back,</i>

400
00:41:38,416 --> 00:41:41,250
<i>but everything happened
and I wound up staying.</i>

401
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:48,157
<i>But I can't anymore.</i>

402
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:51,461
<i>I can't love anyone because
I can't kill for anyone.</i>

403
00:41:57,202 --> 00:41:59,752
<i>So I'm going,
like I always should have.</i>

404
00:42:03,527 --> 00:42:06,642
<i>Don't come after me, please.</i>

405
00:42:29,136 --> 00:42:38,251
