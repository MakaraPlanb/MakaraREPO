AMC's The Walking Dead</i>

2
00:00:03,558 --> 00:00:05,019
I know you're scared.

3
00:00:05,187 --> 00:00:07,021
The wall's going
to hold together.

4
00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:08,022
Can you?

5
00:00:09,191 --> 00:00:10,951
I don't get to
know what will happen.

6
00:00:11,027 --> 00:00:12,192
I have to live with that.

7
00:00:12,295 --> 00:00:14,194
<i>The others,</i>
<i>they're gonna be back.</i>

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,246
<i>They're gonna be back.</i>

9
00:00:15,364 --> 00:00:17,197
So you wanna just
leave her out there?

10
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:18,198
She's your friend.

11
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:19,250
My girlfriend.

12
00:00:19,368 --> 00:00:21,252
I mean 'cause she
was anyway, right?

13
00:00:24,423 --> 00:00:27,541
<i>You have to protect everyone...</i>

14
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:29,743
<i>...to create peace.</i>

15
00:00:36,017 --> 00:00:37,551
<i>Thank you.</i>

16
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:18,445
<i>Hey, heads up!</i>

17
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,450
Shit.
I said heads up.

18
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:28,322
Enid?

19
00:03:49,011 --> 00:03:50,711
Enid.

20
00:03:50,713 --> 00:03:52,880
What are you doing out here?

21
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,951
<i>There's another water
bottle in the corner.</i>

22
00:03:57,953 --> 00:03:59,453
<i>Take it and go.</i>

23
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,925
You're not gonna answer me?

24
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,428
<i>No.</i>

25
00:04:44,266 --> 00:04:46,433
What happened in Alexandria?

26
00:04:49,905 --> 00:04:52,406
We heard that sound.

27
00:04:52,408 --> 00:04:54,241
The gunfire.

28
00:04:58,113 --> 00:04:59,880
Enid.

29
00:05:01,784 --> 00:05:05,185
<i>What happened is
what always happens.</i>

30
00:05:05,187 --> 00:05:07,287
<i>People died.</i>

31
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:09,823
The herd broke
through the walls?

32
00:05:09,825 --> 00:05:11,058
<i>What herd?</i>

33
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,026
The walkers.

34
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:14,728
They broke out
of the quarry early.

35
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,030
We got on them, but that
sound, the air horn,

36
00:05:17,032 --> 00:05:18,866
what was that?

37
00:05:18,868 --> 00:05:21,585
<i>It was people.</i>

38
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,570
<i>You should go.</i>

39
00:05:29,044 --> 00:05:31,345
My wife,

40
00:05:31,347 --> 00:05:33,780
Maggie,

41
00:05:33,782 --> 00:05:35,682
she okay?

42
00:05:39,054 --> 00:05:41,188
Enid?

43
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,241
Is Maggie okay?

44
00:05:47,563 --> 00:05:49,329
Answer me!

45
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:54,735
Enid.

46
00:05:55,838 --> 00:05:57,387
Enid!

47
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,108
Enid.

48
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:17,010
Hey, Enid!

49
00:06:33,642 --> 00:06:35,342
Enid!

00:07:42,915 --> 00:07:44,932
Morgan.

52
00:07:47,937 --> 00:07:50,421
Morning.

53
00:07:50,423 --> 00:07:52,473
We haven't talked.
We should.

54
00:07:52,475 --> 00:07:54,541
<i>A little later, okay?</i>

55
00:07:54,543 --> 00:07:56,510
Okay.

56
00:08:42,358 --> 00:08:45,426
You don't have to be
up here so much.

57
00:08:45,428 --> 00:08:47,294
I won't be.

58
00:08:47,296 --> 00:08:50,247
This is the direction
he'd come in.

59
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:55,132
If he sends up a signal,
it'll be from out there.

60
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:57,384
Yeah.

61
00:08:57,386 --> 00:08:59,136
Or it-- it won't be.

62
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,259
When we go out there,

63
00:09:05,261 --> 00:09:07,811
it's never easy,
it's never simple.

64
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:10,314
It's always a fight.

65
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:13,383
But we've come back
from harder things.

66
00:09:13,385 --> 00:09:15,719
From further away.

67
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:19,857
Glenn, Daryl, Abraham, and
Sasha, they will, too.

68
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,598
Maybe we don't wait
for them to be back.

69
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:32,369
We should start figuring out
how to draw the walkers away.

70
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:35,005
We have some food and
water to last us a while

71
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:37,274
and the walls are holding.

72
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,842
We can take our time.

73
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,695
Really think this through.
Do it right.

74
00:09:41,697 --> 00:09:45,732
Clear it so they can--
they can walk right in.

75
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:53,457
I saw Judith in the house
the other day.

76
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,159
She's starting to--

77
00:09:58,214 --> 00:09:59,897
she's starting
to look like Lori.

78
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,801
- Yeah.
- Made me happy.

79
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:06,737
Me, too.

80
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,920
Dad.

81
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:14,615
Handguns will be a little
better for your first go.

82
00:12:14,617 --> 00:12:19,069
Magazine release.
Slide release.

83
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,038
Thumb safety.

84
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,572
That stuff's easy, right, Dad?

85
00:12:22,574 --> 00:12:26,310
Yeah.
Empty magazine.

86
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,764
- Empty chamber. See it?
- Yeah.

87
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,852
Someone's in front of you,
they have a gun.

88
00:12:35,854 --> 00:12:39,339
You're gonna be scared.
You will be.

89
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:43,493
Your body's gonna tense,
you won't have time to think.

90
00:12:43,495 --> 00:12:46,513
You're just gonna want to pull the
trigger when you get it in front of you.

91
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,867
But you'll miss

92
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:53,437
and you'll be dead.

93
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,322
You have to get it
up to your eye.

94
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,693
You've got to be strong enough
to wait for your moment.

95
00:13:03,248 --> 00:13:05,382
Can I, uh...?

96
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:15,592
Hey, your finger doesn't
touch the trigger

97
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,627
until you're ready to shoot.

98
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,073
Keep that one with you.

99
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:32,743
Get a feel of what it's
like to carry one around.

100
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,212
Can I shoot it?

101
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:38,215
Maybe like down at the walkers?

102
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,167
<i>No, with things how they are,</i>

103
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:41,952
<i>the walls are strong,</i>

104
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,954
<i>but we're lucky the
walkers are spread out.</i>

105
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,989
We don't want to pull
them all to one spot.

106
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,525
Well, what about, like, target
practice in the center of town?

107
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:51,328
'Cause then the sound will
spread out in each direction.

108
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,770
<i>Or maybe we could use, like,
silencers or something like that.</i>

109
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,706
But, uh...

110
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:06,043
I mean, we probably don't want
to waste bullets right now, huh?

111
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,083
Just want to learn more.

112
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,153
You will.

113
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,539
Hey.
Sorry.

114
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,274
I was making--

115
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,877
you want some oatmeal?

116
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,482
Thank you.
I'm-- I'm okay.

117
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:48,118
You were coming to the door.
What's up?

118
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,458
Want me to take
a look at your arm?

119
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,443
No, I'm not here for--

120
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,431
I'm fine.

121
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:05,802
You can tell me if you're not.

122
00:15:12,928 --> 00:15:14,694
Morgan.

123
00:15:14,696 --> 00:15:16,513
<i>Can we talk now?</i>

124
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,315
Uh-huh.

125
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:24,054
What's going on?

126
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,556
When I was coming back...

127
00:15:28,577 --> 00:15:31,912
I tried to cut off
the herd with the RV.

128
00:15:31,914 --> 00:15:34,714
Lead the walkers away.

129
00:15:34,716 --> 00:15:38,034
But five of those people with
the Ws in their foreheads,

130
00:15:38,036 --> 00:15:40,537
they stopped me.

131
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:43,573
They tried to kill me,
shot up the RV.

132
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:49,579
Now, Carol says she saw you.

133
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,581
That you wouldn't
kill those people.

134
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,917
Did you let any of them go?

135
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,504
Yes, I did.

136
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,994
I didn't want to kill five
people I didn't have to kill.

137
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,178
They burned people alive.

138
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,897
Yeah.

139
00:16:18,343 --> 00:16:20,744
Why didn't you kill me, Rick,

140
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,979
back in King County?

141
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:25,565
Pulled a knife on you.
I stabbed you.

142
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,484
So why didn't you kill me?

143
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,319
Was it 'cause I saved you
after the hospital?

144
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,021
'Cause I knew who you were.

145
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:34,057
Back there I would have killed
you as soon as look at you.

146
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,226
And I tried.

147
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:38,178
But you, you let me live

148
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,981
and then I was there
to help Aaron and Daryl.

149
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,437
See, if I--
if I wasn't there...

150
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:51,775
if they died...

151
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,683
maybe those wolves wouldn't have
been able to come back here.

152
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,421
I don't know
what's right anymore.

153
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,492
'Cause I did want
to kill those men.

154
00:17:09,494 --> 00:17:12,162
I seen what they did,
what they keep doing.

155
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,966
I knew I could end it.

156
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,856
But I also know
that people can change.

157
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:28,778
'Cause everyone
sitting here has.

158
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,881
All life is precious.

159
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:34,217
And that idea--
that idea changed me.

160
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,486
It brought me back
and it keeps me living.

161
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,355
I just don't think
it can be that easy.

162
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,123
- It's not easy.
- I wasn't saying--

163
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,592
I-- I know.

164
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:45,428
And I've thought about
letting that idea go.

165
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,764
But I don't want to.

166
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,299
You may have to.

167
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:54,204
Things aren't as simple
as four words.

168
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,389
I don't think they ever were.

169
00:17:56,391 --> 00:17:58,742
Do you think
I don't belong here?

170
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,995
Making it now,

171
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,897
do you really think
you can do that

172
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:05,915
without getting blood
on your hands?

173
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,657
I don't know.

174
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,711
If we can somehow
get outside the walls,

175
00:18:52,713 --> 00:18:55,197
get back to our cars
at the quarry,

176
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:56,982
we could use them
to draw them away.

177
00:18:56,984 --> 00:18:59,284
We'll set up more watch points.

178
00:18:59,286 --> 00:19:01,136
Coordinate the shooting
of guns and flares

179
00:19:01,138 --> 00:19:04,055
so we could pull them out
in even directions.

180
00:19:04,057 --> 00:19:05,948
We'd need to get
all our people on it.

181
00:19:06,068 --> 00:19:09,561
Carl, Tara, Rosita, Carol.

182
00:19:09,563 --> 00:19:11,530
What about everybody else?

183
00:19:11,532 --> 00:19:14,433
Well, let's just keep
this to our own for now.

184
00:19:14,435 --> 00:19:16,168
Really?

185
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:20,172
Look, if we had the time to
bring the people along, sure.

186
00:19:20,174 --> 00:19:22,774
But we haven't had
a chance to catch our breath.

187
00:19:24,344 --> 00:19:26,278
Really?

188
00:19:28,182 --> 00:19:31,349
We're in here together.

189
00:19:31,351 --> 00:19:33,518
We're catching
our breath right now.

190
00:19:35,122 --> 00:19:37,189
Anything else is just excuses.

191
00:19:43,797 --> 00:19:46,064
Deanna.

192
00:19:46,066 --> 00:19:47,916
<i>Rick.</i>

193
00:19:47,918 --> 00:19:50,135
What's that?

194
00:19:50,137 --> 00:19:53,789
Plans for the expansion.

195
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,424
We got a few other things
on our plate right now.

196
00:19:56,426 --> 00:19:59,344
I know.

197
00:19:59,346 --> 00:20:02,412
These are for what Alexandria
can be after this.

198
00:20:02,649 --> 00:20:04,599
Because one way or another,

199
00:20:04,601 --> 00:20:07,035
there's gonna be an after this.

200
00:20:13,215 --> 00:20:16,183
Now, when the blade connects,
don't jerk it right back.

201
00:20:16,185 --> 00:20:18,652
- You'll get stuck.
<i>- Stuck?</i>

202
00:20:18,654 --> 00:20:20,604
Like an ax cutting into a tree.

203
00:20:20,606 --> 00:20:22,289
It's easier to get a blade
into bone than out.

204
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:25,025
So what should we do?

205
00:20:25,027 --> 00:20:27,060
You should slide the machete
down through the wound.

206
00:20:27,062 --> 00:20:28,695
One fluid motion.

207
00:20:28,697 --> 00:20:31,381
Okay, you ease it through
the bone like this.

208
00:20:31,383 --> 00:20:33,984
<i>All right?</i>

209
00:20:43,145 --> 00:20:45,111
Hey!

210
00:20:45,113 --> 00:20:48,231
I'm a weapons novice holding
a significant blade here

211
00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:50,534
and there are people in my
proximity with open-toed shoes.

212
00:20:50,536 --> 00:20:53,220
That's right.
So get a grip.

213
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,961
What are you so scared of?

214
00:21:02,631 --> 00:21:04,497
That would be dying.

215
00:21:04,499 --> 00:21:06,266
Dying is simple.

216
00:21:06,268 --> 00:21:09,319
It all just stops.
You're dead.

217
00:21:09,321 --> 00:21:11,972
The people around you dying,

218
00:21:11,974 --> 00:21:13,873
that's the hard part.

219
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:16,760
Okay? 'Cause you keep living

220
00:21:16,762 --> 00:21:20,714
<i>knowing that they're gone</i>

221
00:21:20,716 --> 00:21:22,582
<i>and you're still here.</i>

222
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:27,854
What you should
be scared of is living

223
00:21:27,856 --> 00:21:31,391
knowing that you didn't do everything
you could to keep them here.

224
00:21:34,496 --> 00:21:36,580
Too upset to keep going?

225
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:39,599
Are the noises scaring you

226
00:21:39,601 --> 00:21:41,618
or can I get back to my lesson?

227
00:21:47,442 --> 00:21:49,042
Let's try this again.

228
00:22:23,845 --> 00:22:26,246
Shh!

229
00:22:26,248 --> 00:22:27,814
The hell are you doing?

230
00:22:27,816 --> 00:22:30,083
Shh.

231
00:22:30,085 --> 00:22:31,818
I'm taking you home.

232
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:34,097
I don't know you.

233
00:22:36,692 --> 00:22:38,391
Why did you give me water?

234
00:22:40,045 --> 00:22:41,945
I had it, you needed it.

235
00:22:41,947 --> 00:22:44,164
That doesn't make us friends.

236
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:47,067
We're not friends.
I'm doing this for Maggie.

237
00:22:47,069 --> 00:22:48,735
Your wife?

238
00:22:48,737 --> 00:22:51,471
She wouldn't leave you behind.

239
00:22:51,473 --> 00:22:53,373
She wouldn't want me
to leave you behind.

240
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:55,809
So we're going.

241
00:22:55,811 --> 00:22:57,677
I'm not friends
with your wife either.

242
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,647
I'm not having
this conversation.

243
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:02,749
I'm not leaving you out here.

244
00:23:02,751 --> 00:23:04,200
We're going now.

245
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,252
No.

246
00:23:22,587 --> 00:23:25,022
Give me the gun, Enid.

247
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:29,126
Turn around and walk away.

248
00:23:31,864 --> 00:23:33,730
You're not gonna
pull the trigger.

249
00:23:33,732 --> 00:23:35,933
I will if you make me.

250
00:23:39,905 --> 00:23:41,672
Let go.

251
00:23:43,553 --> 00:23:46,426
Asshole.

252
00:23:46,428 --> 00:23:48,545
You point a gun at me
and I'm the asshole?

253
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:54,524
Let's go.

254
00:23:54,526 --> 00:23:56,593
Out the back down the alley.

255
00:23:56,595 --> 00:23:58,278
We're taking the road.
We need visibility.

256
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,586
<i>Why?</i>

257
00:24:01,544 --> 00:24:03,166
Because half the herd broke off

258
00:24:03,168 --> 00:24:05,149
and they're headed towards home.

259
00:24:06,354 --> 00:24:08,104
I guess you missed that.

260
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:11,874
Lead the way.

261
00:24:58,568 --> 00:25:00,356
You look like
you could use some help.

262
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:10,133
You know, I think we could build
up a brace on this thing.

263
00:25:32,057 --> 00:25:33,489
<i>What?</i>

264
00:25:38,897 --> 00:25:41,030
Think your wife wouldn't
have wanted me to kill it?

265
00:26:06,491 --> 00:26:08,658
We can use them
to distract them.

266
00:26:13,565 --> 00:26:15,748
There's a helium tank
in those shrubs.

267
00:26:16,868 --> 00:26:18,835
More balloons, more string.

268
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:41,657
It don't mean anything
as long as we keep this up.

269
00:26:45,864 --> 00:26:49,132
You know, you scared the hell out
of people when we first saw you.

270
00:26:49,134 --> 00:26:50,800
I know.

271
00:26:54,255 --> 00:26:56,339
You scared the hell out of me.

272
00:26:56,341 --> 00:26:59,208
With that beard.

273
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,177
The way you looked around

274
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:04,413
like you were seeing
things we weren't...

275
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:07,150
hiding around corners.

276
00:27:07,152 --> 00:27:08,918
Turns out you were.

277
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:17,460
Things moved slow here.

278
00:27:19,547 --> 00:27:22,999
And then things
just started moving fast.

279
00:27:23,001 --> 00:27:24,534
Too fast.

280
00:27:26,154 --> 00:27:28,571
But don't give up on us.

281
00:27:40,351 --> 00:27:42,218
Who did you stay with back home?

282
00:27:43,721 --> 00:27:45,688
It's not my home.

283
00:27:51,362 --> 00:27:53,696
I lived in Olivia's place.

284
00:27:54,966 --> 00:27:58,301
But I was on my own.

285
00:28:00,021 --> 00:28:02,171
Orphaned by walkers.

286
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,012
Me, too.

287
00:28:10,014 --> 00:28:11,981
Probably.

288
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:16,452
It's just what happens.

289
00:28:29,234 --> 00:28:30,967
I get that you're scared.

290
00:28:30,969 --> 00:28:33,135
I'm not scared.

291
00:28:33,137 --> 00:28:35,605
Yeah, you are.

292
00:28:35,607 --> 00:28:37,740
You don't want
to lose anything again,

293
00:28:37,742 --> 00:28:41,878
so you give up and you say,
"That's just what happens."

294
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,147
- I don't need a lecture.
- <i> Yeah, I think you do.</i>

295
00:28:45,149 --> 00:28:48,150
You honor the dead by going on.

296
00:28:49,554 --> 00:28:51,420
Even when you're scared.

297
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:55,691
You live because
they don't get to.

298
00:28:57,562 --> 00:28:59,829
You think your parents
wanted you

299
00:28:59,831 --> 00:29:01,864
waving around a gun
because you're afraid?

300
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:03,599
We don't have to talk.

301
00:29:10,008 --> 00:29:11,841
We don't have to talk.

302
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,196
Crap.

303
00:30:11,395 --> 00:30:12,820
My God.

304
00:30:31,002 --> 00:30:32,668
Stop.

305
00:30:33,685 --> 00:30:35,257
I said stop.

306
00:30:35,384 --> 00:30:37,434
What's the point?

307
00:30:42,358 --> 00:30:44,641
The world is trying to die.

308
00:30:47,229 --> 00:30:49,613
We're supposed to just let it.

309
00:30:49,615 --> 00:30:52,066
No.

310
00:30:52,068 --> 00:30:54,318
You're wrong.

311
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,986
We're not supposed
to let the world die.

312
00:30:57,706 --> 00:31:00,791
And I sure as hell
am not gonna let you die.

313
00:31:00,793 --> 00:31:02,980
I'm sure your wife
will forgive you.

314
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,162
It's not for her anymore.

315
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,084
Look, the walls are still up.

316
00:31:10,086 --> 00:31:12,669
The houses are still up.

317
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:14,755
We'll find out the rest.

318
00:31:16,092 --> 00:31:17,975
Okay?

319
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:30,020
What the hell?

320
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:41,448
<i>Spencer.</i>

321
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:44,535
Hey, Spencer, get back here!

322
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:48,038
Tara.

323
00:31:52,044 --> 00:31:53,127
Spencer.

324
00:31:54,296 --> 00:31:56,296
Spencer, get back here now.

325
00:31:59,768 --> 00:32:02,186
Spencer.
Spencer, move!

326
00:32:13,232 --> 00:32:15,282
<i>Go! Keep moving!</i>

327
00:32:15,284 --> 00:32:17,284
- <i> Hurry!</i>
- Eugene...

328
00:32:17,286 --> 00:32:19,369
have Maggie and Rosita fire their
guns out from their posts.

329
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:21,455
- Why?
- Just do it!

330
00:32:21,457 --> 00:32:24,491
- Tara, I cannot in good conscience--
- Just do it!

331
00:32:32,218 --> 00:32:33,750
Spencer, come on!

332
00:33:12,124 --> 00:33:13,957
Grab on!

333
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:26,053
Tara! You almost died
once for these people.

334
00:33:26,055 --> 00:33:27,387
What?

335
00:33:27,389 --> 00:33:28,939
What the hell were you doing?

336
00:33:31,694 --> 00:33:34,478
Lost a damn shoe.
Crap.

337
00:33:36,148 --> 00:33:37,882
What was that?

338
00:33:38,006 --> 00:33:42,102
I was trying to help. I wanted
to get to a car, draw them away.

339
00:33:42,222 --> 00:33:44,811
You ever make a climb
like that before?

340
00:33:47,781 --> 00:33:50,782
You want to help? Don't make
us come running to save you.

341
00:33:50,784 --> 00:33:53,485
You got an idea, you come to me.

342
00:33:53,487 --> 00:33:56,321
Would you have listened to me?

343
00:34:08,065 --> 00:34:10,282
Everything okay now?

344
00:34:10,284 --> 00:34:11,950
It's handled.

345
00:34:13,821 --> 00:34:15,954
Everything's fine.

346
00:34:27,487 --> 00:34:28,650
Cheat sheets.

347
00:34:33,374 --> 00:34:35,674
Yeah.

348
00:34:35,676 --> 00:34:38,210
Probably doesn't
give you a lot of faith.

349
00:34:38,212 --> 00:34:40,495
I have faith.

350
00:34:40,497 --> 00:34:42,881
Well, you have to, right?

351
00:34:42,883 --> 00:34:45,350
You don't have to.
I choose to.

352
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,021
You should, too.

353
00:34:49,023 --> 00:34:51,957
So are you gonna tell me
why you're here this time?

354
00:34:53,727 --> 00:34:57,179
How well is the community
stocked with antibiotics?

355
00:34:57,181 --> 00:35:00,032
We're good.

356
00:35:01,185 --> 00:35:03,535
I need to dress a wound,

357
00:35:03,537 --> 00:35:05,470
but I don't know
if it's infected.

358
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:07,406
I don't want to waste
medicine if I don't have to.

359
00:35:07,408 --> 00:35:08,974
FWoPP'RS.

360
00:35:08,976 --> 00:35:12,010
Fever, warmth, pus,
pain, redness...

361
00:35:14,481 --> 00:35:17,182
um...

362
00:35:17,184 --> 00:35:19,318
Tell me what it is.

363
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:25,123
Swelling.

364
00:35:29,113 --> 00:35:30,762
Let's take a look at your arm.

365
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:34,132
I didn't come in this morning

366
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:36,101
because I didn't want to get
you involved in something

367
00:35:36,103 --> 00:35:39,204
that you may not want
to be involved in.

368
00:35:39,206 --> 00:35:41,306
<i>In a secret.</i>

369
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:47,362
It's not my wound.

370
00:36:42,736 --> 00:36:45,504
- Hi.
- Hey.

371
00:36:45,506 --> 00:36:47,322
I know you just took care
of Judith this morning,

372
00:36:47,324 --> 00:36:48,974
but they want some help
with the watch points

373
00:36:48,976 --> 00:36:50,609
after that thing with Spencer.
Could you...?

374
00:36:50,611 --> 00:36:52,010
Oh, yeah, no problem.

375
00:36:52,012 --> 00:36:53,345
Unless you want me
to take your shift.

376
00:36:53,347 --> 00:36:54,679
No, I like being up there.

377
00:36:56,049 --> 00:36:57,516
Even with all them outside?

378
00:36:57,518 --> 00:37:00,952
You can see everything.
Even inside.

379
00:37:00,954 --> 00:37:03,321
Um, let me just lock these up.

380
00:37:03,323 --> 00:37:04,756
- Can you give me a second?
- Mm-hmm.

381
00:37:04,758 --> 00:37:06,324
- Do you want to come in?
- Yeah.

382
00:37:17,805 --> 00:37:19,538
<i>Carol?</i>

383
00:37:22,276 --> 00:37:23,775
Carol.

384
00:37:23,777 --> 00:37:26,211
What, Sam?

385
00:37:28,482 --> 00:37:30,515
Sam?

386
00:37:32,152 --> 00:37:34,152
What happens if you
can't live with it?

387
00:37:34,154 --> 00:37:37,355
I told you, it eats you up.

388
00:37:37,357 --> 00:37:39,724
Can you come down here?
I can barely hear you.

389
00:37:41,745 --> 00:37:44,763
The people who came,

390
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:46,765
were they the monsters?

391
00:37:49,002 --> 00:37:51,219
<i>Did my dad turn into one?</i>

392
00:37:51,221 --> 00:37:52,871
What?

393
00:37:52,873 --> 00:37:55,340
If you kill people,

394
00:37:55,342 --> 00:37:58,059
do you turn into
one of the monsters?

395
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:03,582
The only thing that keeps you from
becoming a monster is killing.

396
00:38:16,313 --> 00:38:19,281
- Thank you for this.
- Oh, yeah, no problem.

397
00:38:19,283 --> 00:38:21,967
Yeah.
Bye-bye.

398
00:38:31,745 --> 00:38:33,845
Who the hell do you
have in that cell?

399
00:39:21,094 --> 00:39:23,528
Hey, you seen Denise?

400
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:24,896
No.

401
00:39:31,004 --> 00:39:32,504
I'll be right back.

402
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,409
Hey.

403
00:39:37,411 --> 00:39:39,811
Look, I'm sorry about before.

404
00:39:39,813 --> 00:39:42,514
- I was just--
- He was stupid. That we know.

405
00:39:42,516 --> 00:39:46,234
I just meant what you did for
him, you didn't have to.

406
00:39:46,236 --> 00:39:48,453
I know.

407
00:39:48,455 --> 00:39:50,355
You could have died.

408
00:39:50,357 --> 00:39:52,857
I mean, I'd like to say
I was thinking about it,

409
00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:54,893
but I wasn't.

410
00:39:54,895 --> 00:39:57,228
Is that why you did it?

411
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:59,064
You weren't thinking about it?

412
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:04,569
No, that's how it works with us.

413
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:06,538
We're stuck with
each other, right?

414
00:40:08,075 --> 00:40:10,475
<i>Rick, you saved my son.</i>

415
00:40:10,477 --> 00:40:12,844
Thank you.

416
00:40:12,846 --> 00:40:14,913
Thank Tara.

417
00:40:14,915 --> 00:40:16,681
I already did.

418
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,920
Now I'm thanking you.

419
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,057
What Spencer did was stupid.

420
00:40:26,059 --> 00:40:28,193
I can't argue that.

421
00:40:28,195 --> 00:40:31,096
- At least he tried.
- That's not the point.

422
00:40:31,098 --> 00:40:33,365
I could have tried.

423
00:40:33,367 --> 00:40:35,350
There was a chance.

424
00:40:35,352 --> 00:40:37,369
How's that?

425
00:40:37,371 --> 00:40:40,872
When the walkers were going
for him, it made a gap.

426
00:40:40,874 --> 00:40:43,375
I could have jumped down,
ran, made it out.

427
00:40:43,377 --> 00:40:45,276
I could have got in a car,

428
00:40:45,278 --> 00:40:46,928
used it to lead
the walkers away.

429
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:50,015
I could have done that
and Spencer would be dead.

430
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,651
But you didn't do that.

431
00:40:52,653 --> 00:40:54,469
Why?

432
00:40:56,123 --> 00:40:58,423
I helped save him
because he's your son.

433
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:02,544
Wrong answer.

434
00:41:46,256 --> 00:41:48,369
That's Glenn.
That's Glenn.

435
00:42:11,997 --> 00:42:22,195
