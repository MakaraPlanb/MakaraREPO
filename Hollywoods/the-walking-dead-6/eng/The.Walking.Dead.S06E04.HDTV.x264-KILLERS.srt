<i>Previously on AMC's
The Walking Dead...</i>

2
00:00:03,531 --> 00:00:05,432
I was supposed to kill my wife.

3
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:07,501
But I couldn't do it.

4
00:00:07,602 --> 00:00:10,270
And then she was just on him.

5
00:00:11,372 --> 00:00:12,332
Do you think he's crazy?

6
00:00:12,406 --> 00:00:14,274
No, I think he's dangerous.

7
00:00:16,377 --> 00:00:17,277
Why?

8
00:00:17,378 --> 00:00:19,279
Because all life is precious.

9
00:00:20,648 --> 00:00:21,928
Some group got inside the walls.

10
00:00:21,983 --> 00:00:22,904
They're killing people.

11
00:00:23,985 --> 00:00:24,885
Carol!

12
00:00:24,986 --> 00:00:25,907
You don't have to kill.

13
00:00:25,987 --> 00:00:27,254
Of course we do.

14
00:00:27,355 --> 00:00:28,755
I'm not very good with guns.

15
00:00:28,856 --> 00:00:30,048
Me neither.

16
00:00:43,492 --> 00:00:45,372
You said you liked talking.

17
00:00:46,874 --> 00:00:48,575
I remember that.

18
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:53,819
"Little chats with a stranger
by the fire."

19
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:55,955
You said it was like the movies.

20
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:02,028
Then you said that you want
everything that I have.

21
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,999
Every last bit.

22
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:16,142
Well, here it is.

23
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:21,480
Every last bit.

24
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:34,560
<i>You don't clear.</i>

25
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,861
<i>You don't.</i>

26
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,799
<i>No.</i>

27
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,301
<i>No, no.</i>

28
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:44,036
You don't.

29
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:47,740
You don't.

30
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,242
<i>It doesn't matter</i>
<i>how many days...</i>

31
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:53,612
or how much time.

32
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,685
We weren't supposed to be there.

33
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,856
You had the knife.

34
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,393
<i>You had the gun!</i>

35
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,197
You were supposed to.

36
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,866
<i>You were supposed to.</i>

37
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,570
You know you were supposed to.

38
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,773
<i>Don't lie.</i>

39
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,143
You know.

40
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:30,793
<i>You know that</i>
<i>you were supposed to!</i>

00:07:28,441 --> 00:07:30,309
I'm s-- I'm sorry.

43
00:07:30,311 --> 00:07:32,211
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

44
00:07:32,213 --> 00:07:34,780
No! I'm sorry.

45
00:07:38,952 --> 00:07:41,320
You don't.
You don't.

46
00:07:41,322 --> 00:07:44,990
You don't!
You know you don't!

47
00:09:44,847 --> 00:09:47,312
You're still the same.

48
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:51,850
You're-- you're
still doing it.

49
00:09:53,189 --> 00:09:55,423
You know what it is.

50
00:09:59,095 --> 00:10:02,597
You know what it is.

51
00:11:08,164 --> 00:11:09,931
<i>Can you step away from the goat?</i>

52
00:11:09,933 --> 00:11:12,800
<i>She's not yours.</i>
<i>I still need her.</i>

53
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:15,003
<i>I'm still figuring out</i>
<i>how to make cheese.</i>

54
00:11:25,114 --> 00:11:27,582
<i>Why don't you put the gun
down and we'll talk?</i>

55
00:11:28,505 --> 00:11:30,574
<i>Have some falafel?</i>

56
00:11:30,694 --> 00:11:32,954
<i>Looks like you haven't</i>
<i>eaten for a while.</i>

57
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:03,251
<i>Really, put down the rifle,</i>
<i>let's talk.</i>

58
00:12:03,253 --> 00:12:05,019
<i>I'm sure we can work this out.</i>

59
00:12:14,171 --> 00:12:17,398
<i>Okay, last chance.</i>

60
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,635
<i>Lower your gun,</i>
<i>step away from the cabin.</i>

61
00:12:44,393 --> 00:12:45,893
Sorry.

62
00:13:23,707 --> 00:13:25,541
What's your name?

63
00:13:27,344 --> 00:13:29,278
Kill me.

64
00:13:30,614 --> 00:13:32,214
Well, that's a stupid name.

65
00:13:32,216 --> 00:13:33,849
It's dangerous.

66
00:13:33,851 --> 00:13:35,551
You should change it.

67
00:13:35,553 --> 00:13:37,620
Kill me.

68
00:13:39,923 --> 00:13:41,156
Kill me!

69
00:13:44,818 --> 00:13:47,096
Kill me!

70
00:13:47,098 --> 00:13:50,399
Kill me!
Kill me!

71
00:14:09,653 --> 00:14:11,820
Kill me.

72
00:14:11,822 --> 00:14:13,689
My name's Eastman.

73
00:14:23,867 --> 00:14:27,936
<i>It's okay, Tabitha.</i>

74
00:14:27,938 --> 00:14:30,572
<i>Aw, shit.</i>

75
00:15:13,783 --> 00:15:16,285
It's yours.

76
00:15:16,287 --> 00:15:19,088
Take it.

77
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,457
<i>It's yours or his.</i>

78
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:23,225
<i>So you take it.</i>

79
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:30,566
16 hours in 19 on the floor.

80
00:15:33,703 --> 00:15:35,738
You know what it is.

81
00:15:47,817 --> 00:15:51,053
You shot at me.
I fed you.

82
00:15:51,055 --> 00:15:52,821
Please don't hurt her.

83
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,660
Good night.

84
00:15:58,662 --> 00:16:03,232
Shh. Shh.

85
00:16:43,706 --> 00:16:47,109
16 hours in 19 on the floor.

86
00:17:24,147 --> 00:17:25,981
Oh!

87
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,218
Oh, that is--

88
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,420
oh, that's terrible!

89
00:17:31,422 --> 00:17:34,590
That-- oh, God,
that is--

90
00:17:34,592 --> 00:17:36,325
that is terrible.

91
00:17:50,607 --> 00:17:53,742
I just wanted to wait a little
while before we talked.

92
00:17:55,612 --> 00:17:58,247
I'm from Atlanta.

93
00:17:58,249 --> 00:18:00,549
I'm a forensic psychiatrist.

94
00:18:01,751 --> 00:18:03,519
The state employed me
to determine

95
00:18:03,521 --> 00:18:06,088
if certain people who did very
bad things would do them again

96
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,589
if they were released
from prison.

97
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:11,760
That was my job.
Now I live here.

98
00:18:13,396 --> 00:18:15,564
Because of the state
of the state

99
00:18:15,566 --> 00:18:18,367
and the whole world.

100
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:20,636
What did you do
or what do you do now?

101
00:18:21,905 --> 00:18:24,239
I clear.

102
00:18:24,241 --> 00:18:26,241
What the hell does that mean?

103
00:18:26,243 --> 00:18:28,076
<i>Walkers, people,</i>

104
00:18:28,078 --> 00:18:31,079
anything that gets
anywhere near me,

105
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:32,581
I kill 'em.

106
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,150
I clear.

107
00:18:36,753 --> 00:18:38,921
Why?

108
00:18:38,923 --> 00:18:42,124
Because that's why
I'm still here.

109
00:18:44,294 --> 00:18:46,595
Well...

110
00:18:46,597 --> 00:18:48,997
that's the biggest load
of horseshit I ever heard.

111
00:18:58,942 --> 00:19:00,776
<i>Here's your lunch.</i>

112
00:20:09,712 --> 00:20:11,713
It's PTSD.

113
00:20:11,715 --> 00:20:14,416
<i>You've been through</i>
<i>trauma, right?</i>

114
00:20:14,418 --> 00:20:17,219
You see that blood
on the end of my stick?

115
00:20:17,221 --> 00:20:18,920
At the sharp end?

116
00:20:18,922 --> 00:20:21,189
<i>That was two men.</i>

117
00:20:21,191 --> 00:20:23,925
<i>Father and son, maybe.</i>

118
00:20:23,927 --> 00:20:26,495
<i>I stabbed one</i>
<i>through the throat.</i>

119
00:20:26,497 --> 00:20:30,866
He just fell to the ground
with it stuck in him

120
00:20:30,868 --> 00:20:33,168
trying to breathe
through the blood.

121
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:39,074
Other one I strangled.
No rope, just my hands.

122
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,944
That was the day
before I came here.

123
00:20:42,946 --> 00:20:45,147
Maybe--

124
00:20:45,149 --> 00:20:46,548
maybe the same day.

125
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:49,284
I-- I don't know.

126
00:20:52,188 --> 00:20:54,456
But that's what I did.

127
00:20:56,726 --> 00:20:58,593
That's what I do.

128
00:20:58,595 --> 00:21:01,229
You killed a lot of people?

129
00:21:01,231 --> 00:21:02,931
<i>Yes.</i>

130
00:21:02,933 --> 00:21:04,800
They were threatening
you, attacking you?

131
00:21:04,802 --> 00:21:06,835
Not all of them.

132
00:21:06,837 --> 00:21:08,537
<i>You save anyone?</i>

133
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,475
You saved people.

134
00:21:13,477 --> 00:21:15,911
Pointless acts.

135
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,915
Everybody turns.

136
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:21,650
I saw a wedding ring.

137
00:21:23,953 --> 00:21:26,555
You had someone
you loved, didn't you?

138
00:21:28,124 --> 00:21:30,158
Children?

139
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,327
Oh.

140
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:35,163
You loved them.

141
00:21:35,165 --> 00:21:37,466
You loved them a lot
if you're like this.

142
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,637
You saw it happen.

143
00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:45,607
<i>That's how this started, right?</i>

144
00:21:45,609 --> 00:21:49,978
<i>It's all happening right in front
of your eyes over and over.</i>

145
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,613
<i>Your body's here,</i>

146
00:21:51,615 --> 00:21:53,915
but your mind is still there.

147
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:57,519
There's a door and you
want to go through it

148
00:21:57,521 --> 00:22:00,088
to get away from it, so you do

149
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,724
and it leads you
right back to that moment.

150
00:22:02,726 --> 00:22:04,493
And you see that door again

151
00:22:04,495 --> 00:22:06,528
and you know it won't work,

152
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,763
but, hell, maybe it'll work.

153
00:22:07,765 --> 00:22:10,031
So you step through that door

154
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:12,601
<i>and you're right back in that
horrible moment every time.</i>

155
00:22:12,603 --> 00:22:14,302
<i>You still feel it every time.</i>

156
00:22:14,304 --> 00:22:17,239
So you just want to stop
opening that door.

157
00:22:17,241 --> 00:22:19,975
So you just sit in it.

158
00:22:19,977 --> 00:22:22,010
But I assure you,

159
00:22:22,012 --> 00:22:24,012
one of those doors
leads out, my friend.

160
00:22:24,014 --> 00:22:26,515
I don't have any friends.

161
00:22:26,517 --> 00:22:28,049
Get to know me.

162
00:22:28,051 --> 00:22:29,785
Oh, I'm gonna kill you.

163
00:22:29,787 --> 00:22:32,521
- <i> Why?</i>
- Because I have to clear.

164
00:22:32,523 --> 00:22:35,490
<i>See, that's the thing.</i>
<i>You don't.</i>

165
00:22:35,492 --> 00:22:38,293
We're not built to kill.

166
00:22:38,295 --> 00:22:41,563
We don't have claws
or fangs or armor.

167
00:22:43,199 --> 00:22:47,035
Vets that came back with PTSD,

168
00:22:47,037 --> 00:22:49,571
that didn't happen because we're
comfortable with killing.

169
00:22:49,573 --> 00:22:51,973
<i>We're not.</i>
<i>We can't be.</i>

170
00:22:51,975 --> 00:22:54,075
<i>We feel.</i>
<i>We're connected.</i>

171
00:22:54,077 --> 00:22:58,013
<i>You know, I've interviewed
over 825 people</i>

172
00:22:58,015 --> 00:22:59,181
who've done terrible things.

173
00:22:59,183 --> 00:23:01,683
I've only met one evil person.

174
00:23:01,685 --> 00:23:04,386
Some of them were born
with bad brains.

175
00:23:04,388 --> 00:23:06,588
<i>Some of them got sick</i>
<i>along the way.</i>

176
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,523
<i>The rest were</i>
<i>just damaged people.</i>

177
00:23:08,525 --> 00:23:11,359
Traumatized themselves like
you, but they could heal.

178
00:23:11,361 --> 00:23:13,695
Some more, some less,
but they can.

179
00:23:13,697 --> 00:23:15,530
We all can.

180
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:19,234
I know it.

181
00:23:21,237 --> 00:23:23,705
It's all a circle and
everything gets a return.

182
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:29,110
The door is open.

183
00:23:31,447 --> 00:23:33,915
That door right there.
The cell door, it's open.

184
00:23:33,917 --> 00:23:36,184
<i>I threw the key</i>
<i>in the river a while back.</i>

185
00:23:36,186 --> 00:23:38,320
<i>I'm not gonna hold you anymore.</i>

186
00:23:38,322 --> 00:23:42,290
I can't stop you.
Go, clear.

187
00:23:42,292 --> 00:23:44,593
Or stay, crash on the couch,

188
00:23:44,595 --> 00:23:47,629
<i>and we'll try</i>
<i>to find you another way.</i>

189
00:23:47,631 --> 00:23:49,831
<i>The door's open.</i>

190
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:51,566
<i>It's been open all along.</i>

191
00:23:55,938 --> 00:23:59,040
You stay or you go.

192
00:23:59,042 --> 00:24:01,042
Those are the choices.

193
00:24:01,044 --> 00:24:04,479
I will not allow you to kill me.

194
00:24:04,481 --> 00:24:06,448
I will not allow that.

195
00:24:30,272 --> 00:24:31,473
<i>Don't!</i>

196
00:24:33,913 --> 00:24:35,580
<i>Stop.</i>

197
00:24:39,753 --> 00:24:41,787
Stop.

198
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,062
I gave you two choices.

199
00:24:55,101 --> 00:24:57,235
Oh, shit.

200
00:25:53,526 --> 00:25:55,627
Kill me.

201
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:08,507
I gave you two choices.

202
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:10,942
<i>The door or the couch.</i>

203
00:27:15,274 --> 00:27:17,909
That was aikido.

204
00:27:17,911 --> 00:27:20,111
That's how I kicked
your ass earlier.

205
00:27:20,113 --> 00:27:22,714
Well, that's how
I redirected your ass.

206
00:27:26,052 --> 00:27:30,155
The people in prison
I evaluated for the state,

207
00:27:30,157 --> 00:27:32,824
the stories I heard,

208
00:27:32,826 --> 00:27:35,994
the things these people did.

209
00:27:35,996 --> 00:27:38,363
<i>One night, my
five-year-old daughter</i>

210
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:43,068
<i>found me crying in the garage
after about eight beers.</i>

211
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,970
Told her I wasn't
feeling too good.

212
00:27:47,807 --> 00:27:49,541
She gave me this.

213
00:27:53,479 --> 00:27:58,016
She had won it at a carnival
at school that day.

214
00:27:58,018 --> 00:28:01,820
She said it'd make me lucky
and I'd feel better.

215
00:28:01,822 --> 00:28:04,823
The next morning I found
a flyer for aikido.

216
00:28:06,926 --> 00:28:08,860
Damn thing worked.

217
00:28:10,663 --> 00:28:12,664
Your wife and your daughter...

218
00:28:14,433 --> 00:28:16,535
they're dead.

219
00:28:25,611 --> 00:28:28,346
It was aikido.

220
00:28:28,348 --> 00:28:29,915
It'll help.

221
00:28:31,183 --> 00:28:33,652
And you obviously need help

222
00:28:33,654 --> 00:28:36,354
if we're gonna make this trip.

223
00:28:36,356 --> 00:28:38,056
Can't just be
me and you to the end.

224
00:28:38,058 --> 00:28:40,659
<i>You're a shit conversationalist.</i>

225
00:28:40,661 --> 00:28:44,296
<i>And I can't make</i>
<i>this trip by myself.</i>

226
00:28:44,298 --> 00:28:46,064
A trip where?

227
00:28:51,737 --> 00:28:53,572
I have no idea.

228
00:29:00,513 --> 00:29:02,213
Good night.

229
00:30:02,908 --> 00:30:05,477
Grassy notes are a
little too Astroturf,

230
00:30:05,479 --> 00:30:07,479
but there's potential here.

231
00:30:07,481 --> 00:30:10,048
There is always potential.

232
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:12,150
Where there's life,
there's potential.

233
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:15,954
I've been a vegetarian
for a while now.

234
00:30:15,956 --> 00:30:19,758
I was afraid that damn goat
was gonna make me a vegan.

235
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,094
I don't kill, but I'm not giving
up on chocolate any time soon.

236
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:31,236
You might notice I'm not giving
up on the Goo Goo Clusters.

237
00:30:31,238 --> 00:30:32,637
They're gonna
remain on the menu.

238
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:35,974
You should try one.
They're good.

239
00:30:35,976 --> 00:30:38,043
Come on, you're alive.
Live a little.

240
00:30:39,412 --> 00:30:40,845
We should go out.

241
00:30:40,847 --> 00:30:42,514
We got a lot here,

242
00:30:42,516 --> 00:30:44,883
but we should scavenge
some things up for the trip.

243
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:46,351
You coming?

244
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,455
<i>Will you watch Tabitha</i>
<i>while I'm gone?</i>

245
00:30:52,591 --> 00:30:54,292
Can you do that for me?

246
00:35:16,055 --> 00:35:18,122
Well, you maimed a tomato plant,

247
00:35:18,124 --> 00:35:21,259
but it looks to me like you
saved a goat today, my friend.

248
00:35:23,462 --> 00:35:24,929
Hey.

249
00:35:26,827 --> 00:35:28,266
Thank you.

250
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:33,104
Progress.

251
00:35:42,881 --> 00:35:44,782
Just a second.

252
00:36:28,027 --> 00:36:31,829
A and B.

253
00:36:31,831 --> 00:36:34,332
A-- you broke
the garden fence,

254
00:36:34,334 --> 00:36:36,267
laid waste to a perfectly
good tomato plant.

255
00:36:36,269 --> 00:36:37,835
You got to fix it.

256
00:36:37,837 --> 00:36:40,972
<i>B-- follow me.</i>

257
00:36:52,217 --> 00:36:54,152
Fixed your spear.

258
00:37:44,772 --> 00:37:47,241
<i>It's about redirecting.</i>

259
00:37:49,644 --> 00:37:50,911
<i>Evading.</i>

260
00:37:53,549 --> 00:37:57,718
<i>And actually caring about
the welfare of your opponent.</i>

261
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:02,020
<i>So you have to
care about yourself.</i>

262
00:38:04,056 --> 00:38:06,624
<i>You have to believe
your life is precious,</i>

263
00:38:06,626 --> 00:38:10,228
<i>that all life is precious.</i>

264
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:13,131
<i>You have to
redirect those thoughts,</i>

265
00:38:13,133 --> 00:38:15,533
<i>the history</i>
<i>that tells you otherwise.</i>

266
00:38:17,403 --> 00:38:20,405
<i>What we've done, we've done.</i>

267
00:38:28,013 --> 00:38:30,715
<i>We evade it by moving forward</i>

268
00:38:30,717 --> 00:38:33,051
<i>with a code</i>
<i>to never to do it again.</i>

269
00:38:36,021 --> 00:38:38,223
<i>To make up for it.</i>

270
00:38:44,563 --> 00:38:47,198
<i>To still accept what we were.</i>

271
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,040
Hey.

272
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:14,292
<i>To accept everyone.</i>

273
00:39:14,294 --> 00:39:17,629
<i>To protect everyone.</i>

274
00:39:17,631 --> 00:39:21,266
<i>And in doing
that, protect yourself.</i>

275
00:39:23,502 --> 00:39:25,970
<i>To create peace.</i>

276
00:39:37,116 --> 00:39:39,717
Why do you have a cell
in your cabin?

277
00:39:45,557 --> 00:39:48,993
<i>Built this place with my wife</i>

278
00:39:48,995 --> 00:39:51,663
<i>a while before</i>
<i>our daughter was born.</i>

279
00:39:51,665 --> 00:39:53,431
It didn't have a cell back then.

280
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:55,433
That was just the other side
of the living room.

281
00:39:57,202 --> 00:40:00,638
In my job I interviewed
over 800 men and 25 women

282
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,974
convicted of awful things.

283
00:40:02,976 --> 00:40:07,345
Stuff from the darkest part
of the human soul.

284
00:40:07,347 --> 00:40:08,913
I was evaluating a man

285
00:40:08,915 --> 00:40:12,116
by the name
of Crighton Dallas Wilton.

286
00:40:13,753 --> 00:40:16,621
Name like that, sounded like
he should own an oil company

287
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:19,157
and wear a big hat--
Crighton Dallas Wilton.

288
00:40:21,694 --> 00:40:24,996
Despite doing some truly unspeakable
acts, he was up for parole.

289
00:40:24,998 --> 00:40:29,300
And he was one of the most damn
likable people I had ever met.

290
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:31,869
He said all the right
things, he went to therapy.

291
00:40:31,871 --> 00:40:35,206
He wrote letters to the prison
board to start a program

292
00:40:35,208 --> 00:40:37,608
to grow flowers
for the waiting rooms

293
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:40,511
in state hospitals, rest homes.

294
00:40:40,513 --> 00:40:44,849
And I saw right through him.

295
00:40:44,851 --> 00:40:46,851
Saw that he was
a true psychopath,

296
00:40:46,853 --> 00:40:49,954
that he knew how to play people,
exactly how to play people.

297
00:40:49,956 --> 00:40:53,157
I was interviewing him
next to the cafeteria.

298
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,226
The place smelled
of industrial pizza.

299
00:40:55,228 --> 00:40:56,661
They were polishing the floor.

300
00:40:56,663 --> 00:41:00,732
I had to shout my
questions half the time.

301
00:41:00,734 --> 00:41:02,433
And there was this moment.

302
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:07,205
Can't even remember
the exchange.

303
00:41:07,207 --> 00:41:10,174
But right then I knew

304
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:13,911
that Crighton knew that I
knew exactly what he was.

305
00:41:13,913 --> 00:41:18,182
Everything he had said,
done to hide away

306
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,485
what he was from
everyone, from himself,

307
00:41:20,487 --> 00:41:22,687
just slipped away, and...

308
00:41:24,423 --> 00:41:26,657
and that model prisoner
of 10 years stood up,

309
00:41:26,659 --> 00:41:28,926
smiled,

310
00:41:28,928 --> 00:41:31,095
and just cracked me
across the face.

311
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,867
His fist felt like a rock.

312
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:39,404
Then he was on top of me and
the floor polisher next door

313
00:41:39,406 --> 00:41:41,239
was thudding out every sound.

314
00:41:41,241 --> 00:41:42,673
And I--

315
00:41:42,675 --> 00:41:46,878
and I saw his face,

316
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,915
his-- his eyes,

317
00:41:50,917 --> 00:41:52,550
his evil.

318
00:41:54,353 --> 00:41:57,088
Mask had slipped.

319
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:00,758
And he was gonna kill me
right then and there

320
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,928
because he knew I would make sure
he would never get out again.

321
00:42:18,844 --> 00:42:21,412
Arm bar counter

322
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:25,650
for being choked
from a pinned position.

323
00:42:25,652 --> 00:42:27,452
Aikido.

324
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,122
I wasn't taking it
for self-defense,

325
00:42:31,124 --> 00:42:34,659
but it saved my life.

326
00:42:34,661 --> 00:42:36,928
And I got to make sure
he never got out again.

327
00:42:39,264 --> 00:42:42,700
Well, got to try.

328
00:42:42,702 --> 00:42:44,969
He got out.

329
00:42:44,971 --> 00:42:47,271
Talked to the right people
who got him the right things

330
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,474
and he broke out,
but it wasn't to escape.

331
00:42:52,978 --> 00:42:55,279
Crighton Dallas Wilton
went to my home

332
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:58,816
and killed my wife,
my daughter, and my son.

333
00:43:00,819 --> 00:43:04,088
He walked down the street
to the police station

334
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:07,558
around the corner
covered in their blood.

335
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,794
He surrendered.

336
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:13,498
Said the only reason
he broke out

337
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,433
was to destroy my life.

338
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,574
A year passed...

339
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:28,346
and he was still working
those plots.

340
00:43:28,348 --> 00:43:31,282
They just let him
work those plots

341
00:43:31,284 --> 00:43:33,718
by the roads out by 85,

342
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,888
grow chrysanthemums,
forget-me-nots.

343
00:43:42,194 --> 00:43:44,862
I built that cell
with the full intention

344
00:43:44,864 --> 00:43:48,499
of bringing
Crighton Dallas Wilton here,

345
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:51,836
putting him behind those bars and
watching him starve to death.

346
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:00,645
And did you?

347
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:07,385
I have come to believe

348
00:44:07,387 --> 00:44:10,221
that all life is precious.

349
00:44:10,223 --> 00:44:12,423
Even for a man like that?

350
00:44:12,425 --> 00:44:14,625
Who did that to you?

351
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,695
To your family?

352
00:44:19,898 --> 00:44:22,667
I have come to believe

353
00:44:22,669 --> 00:44:26,704
that all life is precious.

354
00:44:32,411 --> 00:44:35,213
That's why we're having
oatmeal burgers.

355
00:44:43,755 --> 00:44:45,556
You're good at it.

356
00:44:49,016 --> 00:44:50,895
Redirecting.

357
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:04,478
We need more gear.

358
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,247
Tarp, crowbar.

359
00:45:06,249 --> 00:45:09,216
I'm thinking we could try for
the islands off the coast.

360
00:45:09,218 --> 00:45:11,118
I think people
could have gone there.

361
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,654
Hell, at the very least,
we could see the beach.

362
00:45:17,025 --> 00:45:18,859
What is it?

363
00:45:20,962 --> 00:45:23,330
I know where we can
find all that.

364
00:46:07,209 --> 00:46:09,310
Who did you lose?

365
00:46:14,149 --> 00:46:16,050
My wife and son.

366
00:46:19,554 --> 00:46:21,589
Who you lost.

367
00:46:21,591 --> 00:46:23,157
Their names.

368
00:46:32,234 --> 00:46:35,269
Jenny and Duane.

369
00:46:38,607 --> 00:46:40,241
I'm sorry.

370
00:46:43,845 --> 00:46:46,046
Don't ever be sorry.

371
00:46:52,621 --> 00:46:53,954
Forms, right now.

372
00:46:53,956 --> 00:46:55,523
Not here.

373
00:46:55,525 --> 00:46:57,892
Right now.

374
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:50,778
You're gonna hold a baby again.

375
00:48:12,602 --> 00:48:14,635
It's all yours.

376
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:44,365
Damn it, move!

377
00:48:44,367 --> 00:48:46,166
Ow!

378
00:48:58,346 --> 00:49:01,815
I said not here.

379
00:49:01,817 --> 00:49:03,751
That wasn't for you to do.

380
00:49:03,753 --> 00:49:06,787
How could you do that?
That wasn't for you to do!

381
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:10,691
You can't just--

382
00:49:10,693 --> 00:49:12,359
you can't just step in!

383
00:49:13,828 --> 00:49:15,763
Tell me how it is.

384
00:49:15,765 --> 00:49:18,866
Tell me how it is!
Tell me!

385
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:23,370
Let's go home.

386
00:49:23,372 --> 00:49:25,539
I'm not going anywhere.

387
00:49:26,541 --> 00:49:29,576
You're coming back.

388
00:49:29,578 --> 00:49:31,545
You are done with this.

389
00:49:33,548 --> 00:49:36,350
<i>You made it out.</i>

390
00:49:36,352 --> 00:49:38,085
You made it out.

391
00:49:48,697 --> 00:49:49,930
Ow!

392
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:04,144
Kill me.

393
00:50:05,647 --> 00:50:07,448
Kill me!

394
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,816
I said not here.

395
00:50:42,818 --> 00:50:46,320
Well, that's the thing, Morgan.

396
00:50:49,124 --> 00:50:51,191
Here's not here.

397
00:51:59,674 --> 00:52:02,041
No.

398
00:52:29,369 --> 00:52:30,869
Thank you.

399
00:53:37,001 --> 00:53:40,539
Oh, she got out.

400
00:53:40,541 --> 00:53:43,854
She figured out
the door was open, too.

401
00:53:44,271 --> 00:53:46,938
I didn't figure it out.

402
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:49,107
You had to tell me.

403
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:53,273
Glad you're back.

404
00:53:53,393 --> 00:53:55,080
Here.

405
00:53:56,949 --> 00:53:59,017
Come on, you sit down
before you fall down.

406
00:54:46,999 --> 00:54:49,000
<i>Well, like I said, they...</i>

407
00:54:50,236 --> 00:54:53,205
let him work
the plots beside 85.

408
00:54:54,674 --> 00:54:56,975
Even after what he did.

409
00:54:56,977 --> 00:55:00,545
They let him because
he was so damn charming.

410
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:03,148
I found out
the schedule, waited,

411
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:05,751
made sure the right
people were working.

412
00:55:07,587 --> 00:55:10,689
I got him in my car quick

413
00:55:10,691 --> 00:55:12,391
and brought him back here.

414
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:16,528
If they'd have caught me,
it'd have been fine.

415
00:55:20,566 --> 00:55:22,334
It'd have been better.

416
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:30,442
But I got him here and they
didn't know where to look.

417
00:55:31,845 --> 00:55:33,378
You gotta sit down.

418
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,982
All right.

419
00:55:36,984 --> 00:55:38,517
I'm okay.

420
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:51,563
I put him in that cell...

421
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:55,133
and I let him starve to death.

422
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:59,805
It took 47 days.

423
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:07,913
And then I was gone.

424
00:56:07,915 --> 00:56:10,582
I was where you were.

425
00:56:10,584 --> 00:56:13,885
And I wasn't trying to open
up the door anymore either.

426
00:56:15,755 --> 00:56:19,090
What I did to him,

427
00:56:19,092 --> 00:56:21,226
it didn't give me any peace.

428
00:56:22,628 --> 00:56:25,330
I found my peace

429
00:56:25,332 --> 00:56:28,767
when I decided
to never kill again.

430
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:34,005
To never kill anything again.

431
00:56:36,609 --> 00:56:38,343
When I decided to settle things,

432
00:56:38,345 --> 00:56:41,780
I went back to Atlanta
to turn myself in.

433
00:56:41,782 --> 00:56:44,449
That's how I found out
the world ended.

434
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,855
But the world hasn't ended.

435
00:56:54,927 --> 00:56:56,761
Progress.

436
00:57:05,242 --> 00:57:08,277
My daughter drew this on the
hallway wall of our house.

437
00:57:08,279 --> 00:57:10,446
She thought I'd get mad.

438
00:57:10,448 --> 00:57:12,448
I just put a frame around it.

439
00:57:15,585 --> 00:57:19,188
After I went back, when I found
out I couldn't turn myself in

440
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:22,057
because there was no one
to turn myself in to,

441
00:57:22,059 --> 00:57:25,461
I went back home
to cut this from the wall.

442
00:57:25,463 --> 00:57:28,431
I lost the car on the way back.

443
00:57:28,433 --> 00:57:30,833
I walked through
30 miles of the dead

444
00:57:30,835 --> 00:57:33,669
for a piece of drywall.

445
00:57:36,674 --> 00:57:38,941
Scariest thing I ever did.

446
00:57:40,944 --> 00:57:43,145
Best thing I ever did.

447
00:57:47,452 --> 00:57:49,552
You can stay here.

448
00:57:49,554 --> 00:57:53,155
You have enough food,
power, security.

449
00:57:53,157 --> 00:57:55,491
For the rest of your life,
you could stay here.

450
00:57:55,493 --> 00:57:58,627
But you shouldn't stay here.

451
00:57:58,629 --> 00:58:02,465
Can't expect such a splendid
guest as yourself to show up.

452
00:58:03,767 --> 00:58:05,768
You stay here, you'll be alone.

453
00:58:07,304 --> 00:58:09,972
You were alone.

454
00:58:09,974 --> 00:58:12,441
Everything is about people.

455
00:58:14,044 --> 00:58:17,279
Everything in this life
that's worth a damn.

456
00:58:17,281 --> 00:58:20,115
It couldn't be just me.
It shouldn't be just you.

457
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:25,488
Hell, Tabitha's gone now.

458
00:58:29,392 --> 00:58:31,660
I'm ready.

459
00:58:33,363 --> 00:58:35,664
I have a gun in
the lockbox out there.

460
00:58:40,003 --> 00:58:41,537
Here.

461
00:58:48,212 --> 00:58:50,079
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

462
00:58:59,523 --> 00:59:02,157
Hope it's lucky for you, too,

463
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:04,260
whatever you decide.

464
00:59:06,129 --> 00:59:08,097
I've decided.

465
01:01:35,812 --> 01:01:37,880
And that's it.

466
01:01:39,349 --> 01:01:41,417
Every last bit.

467
01:01:45,188 --> 01:01:48,190
You think it can work out
that way with me?

468
01:01:48,192 --> 01:01:51,160
Yes.

469
01:01:51,162 --> 01:01:52,695
I think it can.

470
01:01:57,034 --> 01:01:59,368
Maybe.

471
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:02,671
You noticed
I'm shaking a little?

472
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,575
Sweating a little?

473
01:02:11,581 --> 01:02:14,183
Oh, man.

474
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:18,987
<i>I saw how settled this place was</i>

475
01:02:18,989 --> 01:02:20,789
in the pictures I found.

476
01:02:22,859 --> 01:02:26,409
I thought maybe there'd
be something here.

477
01:02:27,531 --> 01:02:30,833
Medicine to help this.

478
01:02:33,515 --> 01:02:36,538
But that was before
you people won.

479
01:02:39,309 --> 01:02:44,113
So I know I'm probably
going to die.

480
01:02:44,115 --> 01:02:46,148
But if I don't...

481
01:02:48,151 --> 01:02:51,386
I am going to have
to kill you, Morgan.

482
01:02:51,388 --> 01:02:56,158
<i>I'm going to have to kill</i>
<i>every person here.</i>

483
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,762
<i>Every one of them.</i>
<i>The children, too.</i>

484
01:03:00,529 --> 01:03:03,999
Just like your friend
Eastman's children.

485
01:03:06,936 --> 01:03:08,604
Those are the rules.

486
01:03:08,606 --> 01:03:10,973
<i>That's my code.</i>

487
01:03:10,975 --> 01:03:13,075
<i>I'd say I'm sorry,</i>

488
01:03:13,077 --> 01:03:15,677
but you said it, right?

489
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,381
Don't ever be sorry.

490
01:04:13,069 --> 01:04:15,668
<i>Open the gate!</i>

491
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:17,794
<i>Open the gate!</i>

492
01:04:17,914 --> 01:04:20,423
