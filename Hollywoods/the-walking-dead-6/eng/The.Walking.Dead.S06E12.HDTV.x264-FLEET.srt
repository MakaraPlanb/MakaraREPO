<i>Previously on
AMC's "The Walking Dead..."</i>

2
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:05,729
You're well-equipped,
but your provisions are low.

3
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:07,569
<i>I'm from a place that's
a lot like this one.</i>

4
00:00:07,634 --> 00:00:09,851
<i>We might be in a position
to help each other.</i>

5
00:00:09,937 --> 00:00:11,219
<i>This is Gregory.</i>

6
00:00:11,305 --> 00:00:12,804
I'm the boss.

7
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:13,972
They still have Craig.

8
00:00:14,091 --> 00:00:14,806
Negan?

9
00:00:14,892 --> 00:00:15,941
They said they'd
return him to us,

10
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,058
if I delivered a message to you.

11
00:00:17,194 --> 00:00:19,060
<i>You give us supplies,</i>

12
00:00:19,146 --> 00:00:20,346
we'll save Craig and take care

13
00:00:20,397 --> 00:00:21,563
of Negan and the Saviors.

14
00:00:21,698 --> 00:00:22,898
Done.

15
00:00:22,983 --> 00:00:25,150
We need to know what you
know about Negan's compound.

16
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:26,235
We need you to come.

17
00:00:26,286 --> 00:00:26,902
It's gonna be a fight.

18
00:00:27,037 --> 00:00:35,037
We'll win. We have to.

19
00:02:34,923 --> 00:02:37,098
- Hey, Carol.
- Tobin.

20
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,201
You deserve some cookies.

21
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:42,570
Oh, no, not with
the kids as hungry--

22
00:02:42,572 --> 00:02:45,940
No, there's plenty.
I foraged a lot of acorns.

23
00:02:51,548 --> 00:02:54,115
- They're pink.
- Beets.

24
00:02:54,117 --> 00:02:56,167
- Beets?
- It's what makes them sweet.

25
00:02:56,169 --> 00:02:58,870
Oh.

26
00:02:58,872 --> 00:03:01,623
I never was much
of a beet kind of guy.

27
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,591
Will you just put it
in your mouth, jerk.

28
00:03:14,656 --> 00:03:19,974
They're the best beet and acorn
cookies I've ever eaten.

29
00:03:21,645 --> 00:03:22,977
Are you screwing with me?

30
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:25,146
No.

31
00:03:25,148 --> 00:03:27,816
Seriously.

32
00:03:27,818 --> 00:03:29,284
They're amazing.

33
00:03:29,286 --> 00:03:31,069
<i>They're back!</i>

34
00:03:48,338 --> 00:03:50,338
- Get Olivia.

35
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,340
She should inventory
what we have.

36
00:03:52,342 --> 00:03:53,612
We'll meet her at the pantry.

37
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:55,973
- You have food?
- Yeah.

38
00:03:55,975 --> 00:03:59,293
Enough for another month.

39
00:03:59,295 --> 00:04:01,662
<i>I need everybody in
the church in an hour.</i>

40
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,847
What is it?

41
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:05,249
We'll talk about it.

42
00:04:09,388 --> 00:04:12,139
Rick, what's going on?

43
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,392
We're gonna have to fight.

44
00:04:52,265 --> 00:04:54,682
It's been a while.

45
00:04:54,684 --> 00:04:56,467
Weeks.

46
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:59,803
- Since what?
- Since we talked.

47
00:04:59,805 --> 00:05:02,189
That's what we did in that cell?
We talked.

48
00:05:07,013 --> 00:05:09,980
Why didn't you tell Rick?

49
00:05:09,982 --> 00:05:13,317
Tara, Rosita, Eugene?

50
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:17,588
- Why didn't they...?
- I told them to keep quiet about it.

51
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,456
Why?

52
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,992
Can we just forget it,
move past it?

53
00:05:24,163 --> 00:05:25,746
You don't have to carry that.

54
00:05:25,748 --> 00:05:27,331
Carry what?

55
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:30,000
You know what I did.

56
00:05:30,002 --> 00:05:31,669
You don't want
to tell anyone, it--

57
00:05:35,224 --> 00:05:37,241
it's kind of like
you did it, too.

58
00:05:37,243 --> 00:05:39,727
No, it's not.

59
00:05:43,182 --> 00:05:45,816
Just go.

<i>And we can work
with the Hilltop.</i>

62
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,650
<i>Maggie hammered out a deal.</i>

63
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,720
<i>We're getting food--</i>

64
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,790
<i>eggs, butter, fresh vegetables.</i>

65
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,090
<i>But they're not
just giving it away.</i>

66
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,680
<i>These Saviors,</i>

67
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,930
<i>they almost killed Sasha,
Daryl, and Abraham on the road.</i>

68
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,550
<i>Now, sooner or later,
they would've found us,</i>

69
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,470
<i>just like those Wolves did,</i>

70
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,300
<i>just like Jesus did.</i>

71
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,940
<i>They woulda killed someone
or some of us.</i>

72
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,730
And then they
would try to own us.

73
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,980
And we would try to stop them.

74
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,650
<i>But by then,
in that kind of fight,</i>

75
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,790
<i>low on food, we could lose.</i>

76
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,740
<i>This is the only way to be sure,</i>

77
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,290
<i>as sure as we can get,
that we win.</i>

78
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,740
<i>And we have to win.</i>

79
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,500
<i>We do this for the Hilltop,</i>

80
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,910
it's how we keep this place.

81
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,420
It's how we feed this place.

82
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,670
<i>This needs to be
a group decision.</i>

83
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:56,310
If anybody objects, here's
your chance to say your piece.

84
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,020
You're sure we can do it?

85
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,690
We can beat them?

86
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,080
What this group has done,
what we've learned,

87
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,200
what we've become,
all of us--

88
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,500
yes, I'm sure.

89
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,700
Then all we have to do
is just tell them that.

90
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,370
<i>Well, they don't compromise.</i>

91
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,180
This isn't a compromise.

92
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,460
It's a choice you give them.

93
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,580
It's a way out,
for them and for us.

94
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,350
<i>We try and
talk to the Saviors,</i>

95
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,650
<i>we give up our advantage,
our safety.</i>

96
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:42,390
No, we have to come for them
before they come for us.

97
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,810
We can't leave them alive.

98
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,650
Where there's life,
there's possibility.

99
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:48,980
Of them hitting us.

100
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,700
<i>We're not trapped in this.</i>

101
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,780
None of you are trapped in this.

102
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,840
<i>Morgan...</i>

103
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,120
they always come back.

104
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,580
Come back
when they're dead, too.

105
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,580
Yeah, we'll stop them.
We have before.

106
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,550
I'm not talking
about the walkers.

107
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,000
Morgan wants
to talk to them first.

108
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,590
I think that would be a mistake,

109
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,170
<i>but it's not up to me.</i>

110
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,930
<i>I'll talk to the people
still at home.</i>

111
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,330
<i>I'll discuss it
with the people on guard now, too,</i>

112
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:25,070
but who else wants to approach
the Saviors, talk to them first?

113
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,770
What happened here,

114
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,520
<i>we won't let that happen again.</i>

115
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,370
I won't.

116
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,320
Looks like it's settled.

117
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,130
<i>We know exactly what this is.</i>

118
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,850
We don't shy from it, we live.

119
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,300
We kill them all.

120
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,980
<i>We don't all have to kill.</i>

121
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,860
But if people
are gonna stay here...

122
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,730
they do have to accept it.

123
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,440
We need someone on the
perimeter keeping watch.

124
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,940
That could be me.

125
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,040
That would be safe.

126
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,340
Safer.

127
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,270
Whatever safer looks like now.

128
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,690
Yeah.

129
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,220
I made that deal.

130
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,810
It wasn't my idea,
but I led us into this.

131
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,200
I have to come.

132
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,820
Those things'll kill you.

133
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,710
You got another one?

134
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,710
Not for you.

135
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,250
And why is that?

136
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,220
'Cause, asshole.

137
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,920
Okay.

138
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,560
Couldn't sleep either?

139
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,510
I never could sleep.

140
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,930
Worried about tomorrow.

141
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,990
You going?

142
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,400
No.

143
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,660
You are.

144
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,650
You can
do things that--

145
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,320
that just terrify me.

146
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,290
How?

147
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,380
How do you think
I do those things?

148
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,970
You're a mom.

149
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,640
I was.

150
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,110
You<i> are.</i>

151
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,060
It-- it--

152
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,950
it's not the cookies
or the smiles.

153
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,780
It's--

154
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,280
it's the hard stuff.

155
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,570
The scary stuff.

156
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,990
It's how you can do it.

157
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,580
It's strength.

158
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,670
You're a mom to most
of the people here.

159
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,060
To you, too?

160
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,980
No.

161
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,850
You're something else to me.

162
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,870
Well, it's not tomorrow yet.

163
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,960
Packing your stilettos?

164
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,300
We'll only be gone a night.

165
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,600
I'm going.

166
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,550
I am, too, but tomorrow.

167
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,440
I'm leaving.

168
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,230
Why?

169
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,980
<i>It happens.</i>

170
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,070
Are you serious?

171
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,770
This is how I want it.

172
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,410
- Why?
- Why are dingleberries brown?

173
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,580
It's just the way shit is.

174
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,580
No, no. After everything
we've been through,

175
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,420
you are not walking out that
door unless you can tell me why.

176
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,140
Tell me!

177
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,220
Tell me why!

178
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,140
When I first met you,

179
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,980
I thought you were
the last woman on Earth.

180
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,260
You're not.

181
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,120
You try one of these?
They're chewy.

182
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,460
They, uh...

183
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,930
got some fight in them.

184
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,440
<i>Describe it.</i>

185
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,360
Rectangular building,
big satellites on it.

186
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,140
- Rick:<i> Any windows?</i>
- I don't remember any.

187
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,140
I think they made it
so there's only one way in.

188
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,480
<i>Guards outside?</i>

189
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,820
Yeah, two of them, at least.

190
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,030
<i>And you don't know
how many people they have?</i>

191
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,490
No.

192
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:57,240
Uh, I mean, no. I saw a place
where they stored food.

193
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,880
It wasn't that big, so...

194
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,960
- Rick:<i> You've been inside?</i>
- Yeah.

195
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,830
They had us load in
supplies one time.

196
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,330
Hmm.
What do you remember?

197
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,000
Are you worried?

198
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,670
No.

199
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,890
No, it's just...

200
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,180
I love you, and I just
wanted to say it before--

201
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,680
you don't have to say it back.

202
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,150
It's--

203
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,020
I'll say it when you come back.

204
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,360
Heath and I are still
going on that two-weeker.

205
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,860
We're gonna leave from there.

206
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,530
Do you want to come?

207
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:38,080
I mean, I can change it so we
don't leave from the compound.

208
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,620
We could come back and we
could leave from here.

209
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,200
- You know, we're gonna get meds, so...
- I can't.

210
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,210
- No, I didn't-- I'm-- I just-- I need to be here.
- Yeah.

211
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,260
I'm the only doctor now.

212
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,790
So I can't.

213
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,460
Yeah.

214
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,300
But I want to.

215
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,060
I'll tell you
when you come back.

216
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,140
Yeah.

217
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,320
<i>And you didn't
see any other rooms?</i>

218
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,410
No, it's a big place.

219
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,410
This is the hallway I saw.

220
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,080
There is more.

221
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,880
And every time, they had you
bring things into here?

222
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,330
Jesus.

223
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,890
We brought a couple
spears for them.

224
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,390
Two of the Saviors took
them down this hallway.

225
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,340
Now, they must've
done something with them

226
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,180
because they didn't
come back with them.

227
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:41,090
<i>Maybe a weapons
locker, an armory.</i>

228
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,260
Okay.

229
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,230
We get in there,
secure the armory,

230
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,100
that's how we end it.

231
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,600
That's how Carol ended it here.

232
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,410
But we don't know if they have
an armory or where it even is.

233
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,500
Well, we've got
a lot of good guesses.

234
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,200
We've done more with less.

235
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,500
We go in at night
while they're sleeping.

236
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,290
The guards won't be sleeping.

237
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,120
Like I said, I think
there's only one way in

238
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,340
and there's no way
to bust through that door

239
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,840
<i>without waking up
the rest of them.</i>

240
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,010
We don't need to.

241
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,100
They're going to open it for
us, let us walk right in.

242
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,680
They want Gregory's head, right?

243
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,060
We're gonna give it to them.

244
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,390
Aaron, Rosita.

245
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,640
You start here.

246
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,080
We'll peel off
every quarter mile,

247
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,150
meet back here
in a couple of hours.

248
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,980
See what we got.

249
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,960
There's no turning back now.

250
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,490
I could walk.

251
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:18,830
Maybe run a little, maybe a lot.

252
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,800
I'm not going anywhere.

253
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,250
I wanted to learn and you
taught me for a reason.

254
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:29,300
Why are you still wearing that?

255
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,680
It's still who I was.

256
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,680
I think.

257
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,850
And it'll be harder for
them to see me in the dark.

258
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:57,030
I almost told everyone
at the meeting.

259
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,540
We're not telling them.

260
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,570
Morgan stood up in that church and
tried to talk us out of this.

261
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,570
What's wrong with that?

262
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,380
Maybe that he didn't know what
the hell he's talking about?

263
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,280
That he should take the win

264
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,010
that we didn't kick his ass out
for hiding that psychopath.

265
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,800
If we told everyone, they'd find
out about Denise, you know that.

266
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,640
That<i> hijo de puta</i>
tried to stand there

267
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,290
and act like we didn't
know what we were--

268
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,860
He doesn't want to kill.

269
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,640
We don't want to kill.
We don't like it.

270
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,830
It happens.

271
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,470
I'm not telling anyone.

272
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,580
What do you think?

273
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,350
Maybe.

274
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:24,670
If we, um, cut the hair...

275
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,620
<i>trim the beard.</i>

276
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,460
<i>If it's dark.</i>

277
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,600
We're gonna kill those people.

278
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,020
Tonight.

279
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,940
Look, I've been lucky.

280
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,240
I haven't had to do it before.

281
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,140
Have you?

282
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:51,150
I've been lucky, too.

283
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,410
You nervous?

284
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:00,710
Have you ever seen
something that, um...

285
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,990
afterwards, you--

286
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,960
you didn't want to sleep

287
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,000
and you weren't hungry because
when you close your eyes

288
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,830
you could see it?

289
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,470
- And when you try to eat--
- Yeah.

290
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,060
Me, too.

291
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,880
Killing somebody has gotta
be worse than that.

292
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,720
It has to be.

293
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,660
So, yeah...

294
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,940
I'm nervous.

295
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,110
For the whole thing, man.

296
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,160
For the whole thing.

297
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,180
We're gonna
take a look around,

298
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,050
try to get a feel for how
many people are in there.

299
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:07,360
We like how it looks, we go in.

300
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,810
A couple of hours before dawn.

301
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:13,280
The guards outside'll be tired.

302
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,730
<i>Everyone inside'll be sleeping.</i>

303
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,200
We don't like what we see, we
head back, make a new plan.

304
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,910
They don't know who we are.

305
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:27,040
<i>We'll keep Jesus in the shadows.</i>

306
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,610
This is how we eat.

307
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,660
This is how we eat.

308
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,640
We roll out at midnight.

309
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,470
Why is Maggie here?

310
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,630
She's guarding the perimeter.

311
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,100
Yeah, but why is she here?

312
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,740
'Cause it's her choice.

313
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,190
I want to stay
out there with her.

314
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,530
Well, this whole thing's
a race to the armory.

315
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:03,950
We need as many people
inside as we can get.

316
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,280
She shouldn't
be out there alone.

317
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,620
She shouldn't be out here
in the first place.

318
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,020
Okay.

319
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,460
Good.

320
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,600
She's done with the hair?

321
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,970
What've we got?

322
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:27,300
- That one.
- Yeah, that's it.

323
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,560
<i>All right.</i>

324
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,280
Though, it's probably good
we're doing this at night.

325
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,060
Something wrong with it?

326
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:41,700
The nose. Gregory's
is a different shape.

327
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,330
He fought back.

328
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:57,500
He broke your hand, right?

329
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,670
Guess there's no reason
to be subtle about it.

330
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,890
What?

331
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:08,730
The Saviors, they're scary,

332
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,750
but those pricks
got nothing on you.

333
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:39,680
<i>Stop right there!</i>

334
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,880
<i>Announce yourself, asshole!</i>

335
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,970
It's Eddie from Hilltop!

336
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,470
It's done!

337
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,550
<i>Step out!</i>

338
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,320
<i>Is that it?</i>

339
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,990
Yeah!

340
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,120
<i>Bring it here, shit brain!</i>

341
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,010
I don't want the bag,
needle dick.

342
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:42,610
Will you look at this shit?

343
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:01,130
He broke my hand.
I broke his nose.

344
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:03,130
That's why he looks that way.

345
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,070
Little bitch broke my nose.

346
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,740
- - Wah.

347
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,170
Okay, looks like you learned.

348
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,380
I'll get your guy,
you'll go home,

349
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:45,000
and you bring us more
stuff next week, hmm?

350
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,850
Well, well, well.
Look who it is.

351
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,140
- Ahh!

352
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,390
- It's okay, it's okay.

353
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,310
<i>We're bringing you back.
We're bringing you back.</i>

354
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,920
Check the doors.
Find the arsenal.

355
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,470
We take them out.

356
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,930
You still a priest?

357
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:41,300
Rick and Carl
taught me about guns,

358
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,970
other weapons.

359
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,720
How to contribute.

360
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:53,860
I'm still a priest.

361
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,040
I lied to my girlfriend
this morning.

362
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:08,990
I, um-- she caught me
thinking about something,

363
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,050
so I told her that I loved her.

364
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,670
For the first time.

365
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:18,590
That's how I told her,
covering something up.

366
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:24,340
What were you covering?

367
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:28,560
That I'd done something
like this before.

368
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,680
That I didn't like it.

369
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,740
Do you?

370
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,940
Do you love her?

371
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,780
Yeah.

372
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:49,420
So, you know what
you're fighting for.

373
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,940
Hmm.

374
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,140
Honeypot.

375
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,550
They're in trouble.
Stay here.

376
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,090
- I'm going with you.
- I said stay here.

377
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,300
No.

378
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,010
Damn it, Maggie.

379
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,980
- I have to.
- No, you don't. You don't have to.

380
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,260
Yes, I do.

381
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,090
<i>What the hell
are you doing here?</i>

382
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,680
What am I supposed to do?

383
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,430
You're supposed
to be someone else.

384
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,320
They need our help.

385
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:14,840
You are staying here.

386
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,350
We need to go. Get them
back to the Hilltop.

387
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:28,890
What? Your people
could be in trouble.

388
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,690
If you get them back,
the deal's still on, right?

389
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:32,360
Right?

390
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,690
If they get themselves back.

391
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:36,530
Andy, drive him
back to the Hilltop.

392
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,070
Look, if they see you
and we don't make it--

393
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,370
We're gonna make it. And
they're not gonna see me.

394
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,740
Are you kidding?

395
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:58,380
Go!

396
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:22,020
Ah!

397
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,410
If it wasn't us,
it was gonna be you.

398
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,450
The hell?

399
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,170
That's one of the locked ones.
I'm gonna cover you. Do it.

400
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,790
Come on!

401
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:38,160
So, this is the next world.

402
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,140
Drop it.

403
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:52,060
<i>Drop it.</i>

404
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,590
You, uh--

405
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,230
you gonna kill me, Padre?

406
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,520
<i>Padre?</i>

407
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,770
"Let not your heart
be troubled."

408
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:07,940
You're just as dead as me.

409
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:11,610
"In my father's house
are many mansions.

410
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:13,440
If it were not so,
I would've told you."

411
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:15,780
You're all dead.

412
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,920
- "I go prepare a place for you."
- Blood's coming.

413
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,630
Amen.

414
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:54,030
Hey, you want to just
come back with us?

415
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:56,730
Take a couple days before
you and Tara go out again?

416
00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:00,150
No, man. I just want
to get out of here.

417
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,050
What is it?

418
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:25,990
Just--

419
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,790
just want to know which
one of them was Negan.

420
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,370
Son of a bitch!

421
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,110
Where'd you get the bike?

422
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,550
Just do it!

423
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,570
Like you did
everyone else, right?

424
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:02,070
<i>Lower your gun, prick.</i>

425
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,590
<i>You, with the Colt Python.</i>

426
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:06,910
<i>All of you, lower your
weapons right now.</i>

427
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:18,340
Come on out.

428
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,760
Let's talk.

429
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,210
<i>We're not coming
out, but we will talk.</i>

430
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,220
<i>We've got a
Carol and a Maggie.</i>

431
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,700
<i>I'm thinking that's something
you want to chat about.</i>

432
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:41,930
