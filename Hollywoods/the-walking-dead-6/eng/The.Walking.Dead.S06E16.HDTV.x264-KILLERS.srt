00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:03,472
<i>Previously, on
AMC's "The Walking Dead."</i>

2
00:00:05,176 --> 00:00:06,216
What the hell is he doing?

3
00:00:06,505 --> 00:00:08,261
I know where Daryl's going!

4
00:00:08,363 --> 00:00:10,096
Carol's still out here...

5
00:00:10,232 --> 00:00:11,631
And I will find her, you go.

6
00:00:19,774 --> 00:00:21,324
Ahhh...
Ah, ahh!

7
00:00:22,444 --> 00:00:23,444
Hey!

8
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,581
Hi, Daryl...

9
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,827
<i>Hey.</i>

10
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:16,162
<i>Hey, boy.</i>

11
00:01:19,234 --> 00:01:21,701
Oh, you're fine.

12
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,876
You are fine.

13
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,578
Hey.

14
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,381
Hey, come here.

15
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:35,251
You... are alive.

16
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,558
Glenn's still not back.
I need to be there for Maggie.

17
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,894
- I said no.
- Carl.

18
00:02:34,896 --> 00:02:36,396
Look, you were wrong before.

19
00:02:36,398 --> 00:02:38,281
This place isn't too big to protect.

20
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,700
And you need to stay back
and help protect it.

21
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,201
This place is ready.

22
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,620
Most of us have been
trained, you know that.

23
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,206
If you were worried about an
attack, you wouldn't be leaving.

24
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,875
You know how far the Hilltop is?

25
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,077
You know what could happen?

26
00:02:52,514 --> 00:02:55,181
<i>Those Saviors are out there.</i>

27
00:02:55,183 --> 00:02:57,116
<i>You know what they did to Denise,</i>

28
00:02:57,118 --> 00:03:01,087
<i>what they tried to do
with Maggie and Carol,</i>

29
00:03:01,089 --> 00:03:04,090
<i>to Daryl, to Rosita, to Eugene.</i>

30
00:03:06,094 --> 00:03:07,949
That's not happening
to you, all right?

31
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:10,129
I'm not gonna let it.

32
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,776
Any change?

33
00:03:23,778 --> 00:03:25,278
She's getting worse.

34
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,529
Good call on the transport.

35
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:28,414
Well, I figured she'd
be more comfortable.

36
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,999
It also means you got room for more.

37
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:33,486
They're out there, so I'm
gonna be there with you.

38
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,789
We are.

39
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,291
Package deal.

40
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,928
Uh, what she said.

41
00:03:46,634 --> 00:03:48,801
You want to run into them, right?

42
00:03:51,556 --> 00:03:54,057
<i>You hope they show up.</i>

43
00:03:56,244 --> 00:03:59,896
Jesus, this is about getting
Maggie to a doctor, not about...

44
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,449
Screw you, I'm going.

45
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:06,753
Enid, stop.
Just wait.

46
00:04:06,755 --> 00:04:08,921
Look, it's a long trip,
and you're just getting over--

47
00:04:08,923 --> 00:04:10,656
It's a superficial graze,

48
00:04:10,658 --> 00:04:12,992
proteins are binding, plus we need
to discuss ammunition production

49
00:04:12,994 --> 00:04:15,745
and manufacture, so let's roll.

50
00:04:15,747 --> 00:04:18,548
I already tried. Give him an
inch, he's taking a mile.

51
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,550
I'm only asking for 23, give or take,

52
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,218
depending on the route.

53
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,087
I know I can be of some help.

54
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:26,639
Now's the time and here's the place.

55
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,341
Don't shine me.

56
00:04:28,343 --> 00:04:30,510
I'll be your anchorman.
Yes, I damn will.

57
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,493
Why the face?

58
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,763
I hope you're not putting this on us.

59
00:04:50,765 --> 00:04:53,699
Huh? I mean, we showed your
people the way forward.

60
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:55,835
We gave you rules.

61
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,938
You broke the rules,
so folks had to die.

62
00:04:59,974 --> 00:05:01,207
The one who fired the first shot,

63
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:03,810
we strung him up
to make an example of him.

64
00:05:03,812 --> 00:05:06,512
It could've stopped there.

65
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:10,349
But you people still didn't listen.

66
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,719
You wanted to fight us.

67
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:16,656
So this is how it has to be.

68
00:05:17,892 --> 00:05:19,275
Get out of my way.

69
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,493
Carl!

70
00:05:23,064 --> 00:05:24,897
Just grab some pistols
from the closet.

71
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:27,266
But hurry.
We've gotta go now.

72
00:05:39,414 --> 00:05:41,581
Carl!

73
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:42,748
Damn it!

74
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,317
Please, please.

75
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,586
No, no, please--
oh! No!

76
00:05:46,588 --> 00:05:49,789
Please, don't.
Oh! Please.

77
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,592
<i>Please!</i>

78
00:05:52,594 --> 00:05:55,511
Carl! Carl!

79
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,467
What happens if you don't come back?

80
00:06:03,271 --> 00:06:05,271
<i>How am I supposed to live with that?</i>

81
00:06:05,273 --> 00:06:07,356
<i>What the hell am I supposed to do?</i>

82
00:06:10,111 --> 00:06:11,994
Just survive somehow.

83
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:18,951
We're ready to protect this place

84
00:06:18,953 --> 00:06:20,586
and the Saviors know it.

85
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,004
That's why they grabbed Eugene.

86
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,674
Look, it's not up for discussion.

87
00:06:26,461 --> 00:06:28,461
Then you're just gonna have
to punch me in the face

88
00:06:28,463 --> 00:06:30,713
and tie me up again.

89
00:06:30,715 --> 00:06:32,632
'Cause that's what
it's gonna take to stop me.

90
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,021
Go on.

91
00:06:45,396 --> 00:06:48,481
We have 24-hour shifts set up
on each of the watchtowers,

92
00:06:48,483 --> 00:06:51,567
each one of them
fully supplied and ready.

93
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:53,119
In the case that we're incurred upon,

94
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,705
we have drivers assigned,
evacuation and distraction,

95
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:58,374
and the rendezvous we discussed.

96
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,160
In the event of any emergency,

97
00:07:01,162 --> 00:07:04,046
my first priority is Judith.

98
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:07,166
I will not fail you.

99
00:07:07,168 --> 00:07:11,170
Are you comfortable leaving me in
charge of Alexandria's defense?

100
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,780
Yes.

101
00:07:20,782 --> 00:07:23,399
Hey, Rick.

102
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:27,069
If the Saviors do show up...

103
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:30,690
I don't know, I'm thinking,
if it's not too late,

104
00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:33,192
should we try and make
some kind of deal?

105
00:07:33,194 --> 00:07:35,661
Tell them to wait for me.

106
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,530
I got a deal for them.

107
00:07:37,532 --> 00:07:38,831
Let's go.

108
00:08:15,937 --> 00:08:18,004
Whoa, whoa.

109
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,134
<i>Carol?</i>

110
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,756
<i>Hey.</i>

111
00:08:39,927 --> 00:08:42,094
I told you not to come.

112
00:08:42,096 --> 00:08:45,665
And I'm gonna start
listening to you real soon.

113
00:08:51,272 --> 00:08:53,072
Here, let me see.

114
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,556
What is this?

115
00:09:27,558 --> 00:09:31,861
This is us about to make
an example out of you.

116
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,647
To who?
My people--

117
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:37,583
everyone at the library,
they're dead.

118
00:10:21,771 --> 00:10:32,101
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny

119
00:11:02,653 --> 00:11:03,919
Hey.

120
00:11:03,921 --> 00:11:05,821
Hey.

121
00:11:05,823 --> 00:11:08,624
We're gonna get there.

122
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,794
The doctor at the Hilltop,

123
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,729
he's gonna make things better.

124
00:11:19,704 --> 00:11:22,538
Hey.

125
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,907
How do you know?

126
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:29,979
Everything we've done,
we've done together.

127
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:33,149
We got here together
and we're still here.

128
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:38,054
Things have happened, but
it's always worked out for us

129
00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:40,706
'cause it's always been all of us.

130
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,992
That's how I know.

131
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,330
'Cause as long as it's all of us,

132
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,299
we can do anything.

133
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:14,356
It's a walker.

134
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,025
It's hard to get.

135
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:19,495
I was going to, but I
was too busy bleeding.

136
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:27,036
Pressure should help,
but you need stitches,

137
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:30,339
antibiotics to make sure
you don't get an infection.

138
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:39,381
Be dark in a few hours.

139
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:43,219
I'll walk the camp, make sure
we're safe for the night.

140
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:46,355
And at dawn, we will head back,

141
00:12:46,357 --> 00:12:48,607
get you some help.

142
00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:50,609
Okay?

143
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,647
No.

144
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,670
What the bitch?

145
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:27,513
<i>What?</i>

146
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,331
Enemy close.

147
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,573
<i>We doing this?</i>

148
00:13:38,643 --> 00:13:40,276
No.

149
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:17,846
He's someone who was with a whole
lot of someones who didn't listen.

150
00:14:21,552 --> 00:14:23,903
We can make a deal

151
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,872
right here, right now.

152
00:14:26,874 --> 00:14:31,126
That's right, we can.

153
00:14:31,128 --> 00:14:33,529
Give us all your stuff.

154
00:14:33,531 --> 00:14:35,197
We'll probably
have to kill one of you.

155
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,498
That's just the way it is,

156
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,035
<i>but then we can start
moving forward on business.</i>

157
00:14:40,037 --> 00:14:42,805
<i>All you have to do is listen.</i>

158
00:14:44,275 --> 00:14:46,675
Yeah...

159
00:14:48,813 --> 00:14:51,597
that deal's not gonna work for us.

160
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:55,351
Fact is, I was about to ask
for all of<i> your</i> stuff,

161
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:59,555
only I'm thinking I don't
have to kill any of you.

162
00:14:59,557 --> 00:15:02,608
Any<i> more</i> of you.

163
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:33,656
Sorry, my deal is the only deal.

164
00:15:33,658 --> 00:15:35,190
We don't negotiate.

165
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,232
Me and my people are leaving.

166
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,570
Okay, friend.

167
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:51,573
Plenty of ways to get
to where you're going.

168
00:15:59,467 --> 00:16:02,184
You want to make today
your last day on Earth?

169
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,422
No,

170
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,957
but that is a good thing to bring up.

171
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,511
Think about it.

172
00:16:13,814 --> 00:16:16,598
What if it's the last day
on Earth for you?

173
00:16:17,985 --> 00:16:19,968
<i>For someone you love?</i>

174
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,770
<i>What if that's true?</i>

175
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,675
Maybe you should be extra nice

176
00:16:26,677 --> 00:16:28,711
to those people in that RV,

177
00:16:28,713 --> 00:16:30,979
'cause you never know...

178
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:33,182
Just like that.

179
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:38,087
Be kind to each other.

180
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:39,988
Like you said...

181
00:16:41,392 --> 00:16:43,859
like it was your last day on Earth.

182
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,899
You do the same.

183
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,094
Why didn't you stay back
and help guard the place?

184
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,033
I owe her.

185
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,937
<i>Why did you come?</i>

186
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:14,842
I owe them.

187
00:18:18,648 --> 00:18:20,781
Logrun Road's a straight shot.

188
00:18:20,783 --> 00:18:22,900
<i>We want visibility.</i>

189
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:28,989
There, you got it on Shelton.

190
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,458
<i>Golf course, country
clubs, sloping terrain.</i>

191
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,160
No bum rush from the bogeyman.

192
00:18:33,162 --> 00:18:34,962
We'd see them from a good piece.

193
00:18:34,964 --> 00:18:36,463
It is a longer trip by a third,

194
00:18:36,465 --> 00:18:38,499
but we'd get the scenic safety

195
00:18:38,501 --> 00:18:40,467
of clear-cut dingles
and glens.

196
00:18:43,072 --> 00:18:44,738
You're being serious, right?

197
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,107
As coronary thrombosis.

198
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:48,642
- You got a route?
- Yeah.

199
00:18:51,781 --> 00:18:53,180
Let's go.

200
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,201
Wasn't just me.

201
00:19:15,371 --> 00:19:17,371
<i>Rick came looking, too.</i>

202
00:19:18,841 --> 00:19:21,975
Daryl, some of the others...

203
00:19:23,379 --> 00:19:25,979
they would've.

204
00:19:25,981 --> 00:19:29,149
They were gone before
they even knew about you.

205
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,517
Gone?

206
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:32,186
They'll be back by the time we are.

207
00:19:32,188 --> 00:19:36,323
Probably back already, wondering.

208
00:19:36,325 --> 00:19:38,692
You think I'm being dramatic here?

209
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,780
Do you really think
you could just come here

210
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:45,332
and tell me to come back
and that's how it'll go?

211
00:19:48,871 --> 00:19:52,573
Those people, your people,

212
00:19:52,575 --> 00:19:54,074
they care about you.

213
00:19:54,076 --> 00:19:57,578
I know they do.
And I care about them.

214
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,179
That's why I can't be there.

215
00:19:59,181 --> 00:20:01,749
That's why you have to be there.

216
00:20:04,553 --> 00:20:07,221
Do you really just not get it?

217
00:20:10,226 --> 00:20:12,476
After everything that's happened.

218
00:20:17,767 --> 00:20:21,201
If you care about people,
there are people to protect,

219
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:24,655
there are people
that you will kill for.

220
00:20:26,342 --> 00:20:28,275
If you don't want to kill...

221
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:32,362
or if you can't...

222
00:20:33,949 --> 00:20:37,084
then you have to get away from them.

223
00:20:37,086 --> 00:20:38,585
You do not get both.

224
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:41,755
You-- you should know that.

225
00:20:41,757 --> 00:20:44,425
No, everything's about people.

226
00:20:45,928 --> 00:20:48,045
Everything in this life
that's worth a damn,

227
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:49,763
that's what I know.

228
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:55,219
<i>And out here on your own...</i>

229
00:20:57,306 --> 00:20:58,939
<i>you'll die.</i>

230
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,942
Then let me die.

231
00:21:01,944 --> 00:21:03,894
No, I can't do that.

232
00:21:05,214 --> 00:21:07,448
It's not your decision.
Just go.

233
00:21:09,618 --> 00:21:11,318
I'm not leaving you.

234
00:21:14,156 --> 00:21:15,989
I said go.

235
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:29,887
Please, just go.

236
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:42,432
If you care
about anyone, M--

237
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:47,955
There is a price, Morgan,
and you're gonna pay it.

238
00:21:49,525 --> 00:21:52,493
I have, and I can't anymore.

239
00:22:14,617 --> 00:22:16,133
Think we could do it?

240
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:18,552
What?

241
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:23,690
What they did, Glenn and Maggie?

242
00:22:28,531 --> 00:22:30,864
Just asking if you could do that.

243
00:22:33,302 --> 00:22:35,602
If you're doing something
as big as that...

244
00:22:38,073 --> 00:22:39,706
if that's living.

245
00:22:42,511 --> 00:22:43,794
Could you?

246
00:22:48,484 --> 00:22:49,800
Yeah.

247
00:22:52,354 --> 00:22:54,021
I could.

248
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,459
Now.

249
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,358
Just so you know.

250
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,532
Bitch nuts.

251
00:23:35,631 --> 00:23:37,631
We making our stand?

252
00:23:40,803 --> 00:23:43,520
Yeah, we end it.

253
00:23:46,642 --> 00:23:49,242
No, not now.

254
00:23:49,244 --> 00:23:52,012
<i>They've been waiting.
They're ready.</i>

255
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,680
<i>With one of us behind the wheel,</i>

256
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:58,285
that's five on 16.

257
00:23:58,287 --> 00:24:02,155
We're gonna play it our
way, how we want it.

258
00:24:02,157 --> 00:24:03,991
Right?

259
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,543
Right.

260
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:10,580
All right, go slow.

261
00:26:38,227 --> 00:26:39,760
Carol?

262
00:26:49,672 --> 00:26:51,338
Carol?

263
00:26:55,311 --> 00:26:57,845
Carol?

264
00:27:13,596 --> 00:27:14,995
Let's go.

265
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,057
<i>How are we on gas?</i>

266
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:44,325
<i>Half a tank.</i>

267
00:27:44,327 --> 00:27:46,894
I pulled some more cans
before we left.

268
00:27:46,896 --> 00:27:50,230
Those weren't the same men who
blocked the road the first time.

269
00:27:50,232 --> 00:27:53,300
Same outfit, different soldiers.

270
00:27:55,371 --> 00:27:58,072
They got numbers.

271
00:27:58,074 --> 00:28:01,175
Yeah, we keep driving,
we get her there.

272
00:28:01,177 --> 00:28:03,277
We will.

273
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:07,081
If we have to shove each and every
one of them up their own asses.

274
00:28:23,733 --> 00:28:25,566
We can't go through it.

275
00:28:25,568 --> 00:28:28,018
Can't risk the RV.

276
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,654
You stay behind the
wheel, just in case.

277
00:28:33,325 --> 00:28:35,159
We'll clear it.

278
00:28:58,601 --> 00:29:01,935
Putting together a red rover
like that takes people.

279
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,723
A lot of them.

280
00:29:19,121 --> 00:29:21,422
Come on, let's do this.

281
00:29:21,424 --> 00:29:23,657
Dad.

282
00:29:23,659 --> 00:29:25,626
That's Michonne's.

283
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:38,756
That's Daryl's.

284
00:30:15,177 --> 00:30:17,344
Get back to the RV!
Go!

285
00:30:38,567 --> 00:30:40,534
<i>Start it up!</i>

286
00:31:14,763 --> 00:31:16,296
<i>What's that sound?</i>

287
00:31:16,298 --> 00:31:18,048
<i>Undercarriage
could've caught a bullet.</i>

288
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:21,468
<i>Or could be transmission.
It could be nothing.</i>

289
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,887
They were firing at our feet.

290
00:31:25,691 --> 00:31:27,774
They blocked the road, but they
weren't trying to stop us.

291
00:31:27,776 --> 00:31:30,544
They want us in this direction.

292
00:31:30,546 --> 00:31:32,246
Barton Road takes us north,

293
00:31:32,248 --> 00:31:33,714
but they gotta know
we wanna go north.

294
00:31:33,716 --> 00:31:34,948
Meadows.

295
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,116
Could take us east a piece,

296
00:31:36,118 --> 00:31:37,651
but we can get back
on track on Mayhew.

297
00:31:37,653 --> 00:31:39,019
We're down to a third of a tank.

298
00:31:39,021 --> 00:31:40,287
We could top off at the next stop,

299
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:42,222
- but no refills after that.
- All right.

300
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,994
She's burning up.

301
00:31:56,588 --> 00:31:58,538
<i>Rick.</i>

302
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:16,239
Go back.

303
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:19,242
Where?

304
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,062
Whoa, whoa.

305
00:33:04,006 --> 00:33:05,572
Whoa.

306
00:33:10,979 --> 00:33:12,879
Come on.

307
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,667
No, get away.

308
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:14,574
Ah!

309
00:34:23,552 --> 00:34:25,018
Ah!

310
00:34:37,933 --> 00:34:40,467
Hey, hey.

311
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:41,735
No, no.

312
00:34:54,933 --> 00:34:58,435
Each breath is getting harder.

313
00:34:59,855 --> 00:35:02,072
I probably don't have
too many more in me.

314
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,827
So I'm gonna make each one count.

315
00:35:08,413 --> 00:35:12,032
So, here's how it's gonna go.

316
00:35:12,034 --> 00:35:17,404
You're gonna lie there and I'm
gonna watch you die slow,

317
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:21,591
just like my friends did
back on that road.

318
00:35:21,593 --> 00:35:23,643
Just like I'm gonna.

319
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:28,181
Let's see who wins, bitch.

320
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:36,806
You see that?

321
00:35:36,808 --> 00:35:39,459
That's a pretty good start, huh?

322
00:35:39,461 --> 00:35:41,228
Huh?

323
00:36:03,064 --> 00:36:04,730
Are we close?

324
00:36:04,732 --> 00:36:07,950
Yeah, we're--
we're getting there.

325
00:36:07,952 --> 00:36:11,571
Were there--
I heard shots.

326
00:36:11,573 --> 00:36:15,708
Yeah, the Saviors, but they're gone.

327
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,210
We are.

328
00:36:17,212 --> 00:36:20,329
We're gonna get you there.

329
00:36:20,331 --> 00:36:22,215
I know.

330
00:36:23,251 --> 00:36:25,468
You're gonna be okay.

331
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,886
The baby's gonna be okay.

332
00:36:26,888 --> 00:36:29,388
This isn't it.
This isn't it.

333
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,924
There's more.

334
00:36:31,926 --> 00:36:33,809
There's gonna be more.

335
00:36:35,597 --> 00:36:37,763
I believe in you, Rick.

336
00:36:54,699 --> 00:36:58,251
What do you got
to smile about, bitch?

337
00:36:58,253 --> 00:37:00,253
What the hell's wrong with you?

338
00:37:02,123 --> 00:37:05,057
<i>There's nothing wrong with me.</i>

339
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:08,844
I'm gonna die, so...

340
00:37:08,846 --> 00:37:11,264
there's nothing wrong
with me anymore.

341
00:37:27,365 --> 00:37:30,866
You think you've suffered enough now?

342
00:37:33,454 --> 00:37:36,205
No, probably not.

343
00:37:36,207 --> 00:37:39,492
Oh, God.

344
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:52,388
<i>What, are you done?</i>

345
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:56,225
Unless you kill me now,
I'm not gonna die!

346
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,347
You decide!

347
00:38:04,285 --> 00:38:08,321
The world doesn't decide!
You decide!

348
00:38:08,323 --> 00:38:11,574
You don't get to walk away

349
00:38:11,576 --> 00:38:14,360
and get what you want!

350
00:38:21,836 --> 00:38:23,836
<i>Stop.</i>

351
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:28,808
Drop it.

352
00:38:31,245 --> 00:38:32,812
<i>You can survive this.</i>

353
00:38:32,814 --> 00:38:35,681
You can.

354
00:38:37,352 --> 00:38:39,118
Drop it.

355
00:38:42,223 --> 00:38:44,774
<i>Please.</i>

356
00:38:44,776 --> 00:38:45,975
No.

357
00:39:04,479 --> 00:39:08,280
Would you please just let me go?

358
00:39:08,282 --> 00:39:10,416
Hey, it's not your time.

359
00:39:12,136 --> 00:39:14,687
You are gonna come back from this.

360
00:39:24,982 --> 00:39:26,766
What happened here?

361
00:39:33,157 --> 00:39:35,341
I found your horse.

362
00:39:37,578 --> 00:39:39,745
Found my friend, too.

363
00:39:41,416 --> 00:39:43,749
She needs help.

364
00:39:49,457 --> 00:39:51,390
Then let's get you some help.

365
00:40:13,698 --> 00:40:15,648
These tracks...

366
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:18,017
they would indicate
they not only have people,

367
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:20,052
but some big-ass toys
and capabilities.

368
00:40:20,054 --> 00:40:22,121
What it indicates
is we are neck-deep

369
00:40:22,123 --> 00:40:25,624
up shit creek with our
mouths wide open.

370
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,167
<i>- Don't.</i>
- I can try and break the chain.

371
00:40:35,169 --> 00:40:36,469
It won't work.

372
00:40:36,471 --> 00:40:39,388
<i>- I can try.</i>
- It won't work.

373
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,177
And we need the bullets.

374
00:41:21,549 --> 00:41:24,967
<i>You're treating
your people good, right?</i>

375
00:41:24,969 --> 00:41:28,053
<i>Like it was your last day on Earth?</i>

376
00:41:28,055 --> 00:41:30,356
<i>Or maybe one of theirs?</i>

377
00:41:32,727 --> 00:41:34,360
<i>You better go.</i>

378
00:41:34,362 --> 00:41:36,595
<i>It's gonna get hot.</i>

379
00:41:36,597 --> 00:41:39,615
<i>You go get where you're going.</i>

380
00:41:39,617 --> 00:41:42,301
Go, go.

381
00:41:48,993 --> 00:41:50,543
Get on.

382
00:42:20,174 --> 00:42:23,943
So, what's the play?

383
00:42:23,945 --> 00:42:26,612
She needs a doctor.

384
00:42:26,614 --> 00:42:30,616
There are two more
routes north from here.

385
00:42:30,618 --> 00:42:33,085
They're probably
waiting for us right now.

386
00:42:37,758 --> 00:42:42,211
So, they're ahead of us,
probably behind us.

387
00:42:42,213 --> 00:42:45,881
But they're not
waiting on us, per se,

388
00:42:45,883 --> 00:42:49,051
they're waiting on this rust bucket.

389
00:42:49,053 --> 00:42:51,971
And they don't know the
moment-to-moment occupancy

390
00:42:51,973 --> 00:42:54,056
of said rust-bucket.

391
00:42:54,058 --> 00:42:55,975
And the sun sets soon.

392
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:18,998
That's the last of it.

393
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,884
If you see a car,
try to siphon the gas.

394
00:43:21,886 --> 00:43:24,303
Other than that, you keep moving.

395
00:43:24,305 --> 00:43:26,672
I'll have them thinking
we're playing their game.

396
00:43:26,674 --> 00:43:29,058
All phases of the turn,
level after level,

397
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,226
move after move, I'll keep them spun.

398
00:43:31,228 --> 00:43:32,811
I assure you, I will.

399
00:43:35,266 --> 00:43:38,100
I got something for you.

400
00:43:38,102 --> 00:43:41,687
It's a recipe, and it ain't gazpacho.

401
00:43:45,409 --> 00:43:47,576
How to Build Bullets 101.

402
00:43:47,578 --> 00:43:50,863
Abraham can show you
where, just in case.

403
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:00,339
Thank you for this.

404
00:44:00,341 --> 00:44:02,458
For all of it.

405
00:44:04,712 --> 00:44:07,513
We're lucky you're here.

406
00:44:07,515 --> 00:44:09,815
I won't argue with that.

407
00:44:15,423 --> 00:44:17,389
You go steady on the pedal.

408
00:44:17,391 --> 00:44:19,158
You don't make that thing gulp.

409
00:44:21,128 --> 00:44:23,529
How come you never
let me drive the truck?

410
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:30,652
I didn't think you could do it.

411
00:44:34,709 --> 00:44:37,242
I was wrong.

412
00:44:37,244 --> 00:44:39,578
You're a survivor.

413
00:44:40,915 --> 00:44:44,133
You always were.

414
00:44:44,135 --> 00:44:46,719
We just didn't know it.

415
00:44:49,256 --> 00:44:51,423
Me and you both.

416
00:45:20,671 --> 00:45:22,671
Thank you.

417
00:46:36,516 --> 00:46:38,466
<i>Aaron, please.</i>

418
00:46:38,468 --> 00:46:41,019
Just let me walk it.

419
00:46:41,021 --> 00:46:43,138
Relax.

420
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:45,690
Just a few more miles.

421
00:46:47,261 --> 00:46:50,312
I heard what you told
her when we were leaving.

422
00:46:52,933 --> 00:46:55,183
We<i> can</i> do anything,

423
00:46:55,185 --> 00:46:58,103
'cause we'll do
anything we need to do.

424
00:46:58,105 --> 00:47:01,523
We have and we will.

425
00:47:05,078 --> 00:47:07,028
What happened to Denise,

426
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:09,614
I'm not gonna let anybody
die like that again.

427
00:47:12,419 --> 00:47:14,252
- Son...
- What?

428
00:47:29,269 --> 00:47:31,219
Go! Go!

429
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:54,409
Ah!

430
00:49:09,286 --> 00:49:11,069
<i>Good.</i>

431
00:49:11,988 --> 00:49:13,488
You made it.

432
00:49:15,325 --> 00:49:17,158
Welcome to where you're going.

433
00:49:21,715 --> 00:49:25,000
We'll take your weapons.

434
00:49:25,002 --> 00:49:26,584
Now.

435
00:49:31,008 --> 00:49:34,676
- We can talk about--
- We're done talking.

436
00:49:34,678 --> 00:49:36,728
Time to listen.

437
00:49:57,117 --> 00:49:59,034
That's yours, right?

438
00:50:01,204 --> 00:50:05,090
Yeah, it's yours.

439
00:50:10,514 --> 00:50:13,548
Okay.

440
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:16,718
Let's get her down and get
you all on your knees.

441
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,438
Lots to cover.

442
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,223
Hold up.

443
00:50:22,343 --> 00:50:24,101
We got it.

444
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:27,062
Sure, sure.

445
00:51:02,315 --> 00:51:04,432
Gonna need you on your knees.

446
00:51:50,043 --> 00:51:52,010
<i>- Dwight!</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

447
00:51:52,012 --> 00:51:53,495
<i>Chop-chop.</i>

448
00:52:01,004 --> 00:52:02,337
Come on.

449
00:52:02,339 --> 00:52:04,422
You got people to meet.

450
00:52:21,441 --> 00:52:23,742
Maggie?

451
00:52:23,744 --> 00:52:25,777
<i>On your knees!</i>

452
00:52:34,538 --> 00:52:36,371
<i>All right!</i>

453
00:52:36,373 --> 00:52:38,456
We got a full boat.

454
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,793
Let's meet the man.

455
00:53:00,647 --> 00:53:02,898
Pissing our pants yet?

456
00:53:08,038 --> 00:53:12,123
Boy, do I have a feeling
we're getting close.

457
00:53:19,049 --> 00:53:21,633
Yep.

458
00:53:21,635 --> 00:53:25,170
It's gonna be pee-pee pants
city here real soon.

459
00:53:28,175 --> 00:53:31,643
Which one of you pricks
is the leader?

460
00:53:31,645 --> 00:53:32,844
<i>It's this one.</i>

461
00:53:35,148 --> 00:53:37,098
He's the guy.

462
00:53:48,195 --> 00:53:49,828
Hi.

463
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:52,080
You're Rick, right?

464
00:53:52,082 --> 00:53:54,749
I'm Negan.

465
00:53:54,751 --> 00:53:58,420
And I do not appreciate
you killing my men.

466
00:53:58,422 --> 00:54:01,423
Also, when I sent my people

467
00:54:01,425 --> 00:54:04,376
to kill your people
for killing my people,

468
00:54:04,378 --> 00:54:06,878
you killed more of my people.

469
00:54:08,715 --> 00:54:11,683
Not cool.

470
00:54:11,685 --> 00:54:13,351
Not cool.

471
00:54:13,353 --> 00:54:16,855
You have no idea

472
00:54:16,857 --> 00:54:18,890
how not cool that shit is.

473
00:54:18,892 --> 00:54:23,061
But I think you're gonna
be up to speed shortly.

474
00:54:26,116 --> 00:54:27,565
Yeah.

475
00:54:29,403 --> 00:54:32,821
You are so gonna regret
crossing me in a few minutes.

476
00:54:35,542 --> 00:54:37,375
Yes, you are.

477
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:43,081
You see, Rick, whatever you do,

478
00:54:43,083 --> 00:54:46,384
no matter what, you don't mess
with the new world order.

479
00:54:46,386 --> 00:54:49,421
And the new world order is this,
and it's really very simple.

480
00:54:49,423 --> 00:54:53,008
So, even if you're stupid,
which you very may well be,

481
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:55,644
<i>you can understand it.</i>

482
00:54:55,646 --> 00:54:57,896
<i>You ready?</i>

483
00:54:57,898 --> 00:55:01,599
Here goes.
Pay attention.

484
00:55:09,776 --> 00:55:12,777
Give me your shit...

485
00:55:12,779 --> 00:55:14,779
or I will kill you.

486
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:21,419
Today was career day.

487
00:55:22,956 --> 00:55:24,873
We invested a lot

488
00:55:24,875 --> 00:55:29,711
so you would know who I am
and what I can do.

489
00:55:31,348 --> 00:55:34,132
You work for me now.

490
00:55:34,134 --> 00:55:37,469
You have shit, you give it to me.

491
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:39,554
That's your job.

492
00:55:40,974 --> 00:55:45,443
<i>Now, I know that is a mighty big,</i>

493
00:55:45,445 --> 00:55:48,229
<i>nasty pill to swallow,</i>

494
00:55:48,231 --> 00:55:53,568
but swallow it
you most certainly will.

495
00:55:57,741 --> 00:55:59,290
You ruled the roost.

496
00:55:59,292 --> 00:56:03,578
You built something.

497
00:56:05,465 --> 00:56:07,799
<i>You thought you were safe.</i>

498
00:56:07,801 --> 00:56:10,835
<i>I get it.</i>

499
00:56:10,837 --> 00:56:14,556
<i>But the word is out.</i>

500
00:56:16,009 --> 00:56:19,511
You are not safe.

501
00:56:21,264 --> 00:56:23,348
Not even close.

502
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:25,850
In fact, you are pegged,

503
00:56:25,852 --> 00:56:27,852
more pegged if you don't
do what I want.

504
00:56:27,854 --> 00:56:30,572
And what I want is half your shit.

505
00:56:30,574 --> 00:56:33,942
<i>And if that's too much, you can
make, find, or steal more,</i>

506
00:56:33,944 --> 00:56:36,528
<i>and it'll even out sooner or later.</i>

507
00:56:39,032 --> 00:56:42,667
This is your way of life now.

508
00:56:42,669 --> 00:56:46,838
The more you fight back,
the harder it will be.

509
00:56:47,874 --> 00:56:52,210
So, if someone knocks on your door...

510
00:56:55,048 --> 00:56:56,347
...you let us in.

511
00:56:56,349 --> 00:56:59,384
We own that door.

512
00:56:59,386 --> 00:57:01,686
You try to stop us

513
00:57:01,688 --> 00:57:05,106
and we will knock it down.

514
00:57:07,561 --> 00:57:09,727
You understand?

515
00:57:12,899 --> 00:57:15,567
What, no answer?

516
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:22,407
You don't really think that you
were gonna get through this

517
00:57:22,409 --> 00:57:24,742
without being punished, now, did you?

518
00:57:26,746 --> 00:57:28,963
<i>I don't want to kill you people.</i>

519
00:57:28,965 --> 00:57:31,466
<i>Just want to make that
clear from the get-go.</i>

520
00:57:32,586 --> 00:57:34,919
I want you to work for me.

521
00:57:34,921 --> 00:57:38,923
You can't do that if
you're dead, now, can you?

522
00:57:42,095 --> 00:57:45,096
I'm not growing a garden.

523
00:57:48,018 --> 00:57:52,654
But you killed my people,
a whole damn lot of them.

524
00:57:52,656 --> 00:57:54,856
More than I'm comfortable with.

525
00:57:54,858 --> 00:57:58,643
And for that, for that
you're gonna pay.

526
00:58:02,582 --> 00:58:04,716
<i>So, now...</i>

527
00:58:08,171 --> 00:58:12,290
I'm gonna beat the holy hell
outta one of you.

528
00:58:18,715 --> 00:58:21,132
This--

529
00:58:21,134 --> 00:58:23,768
this is Lucille,

530
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:28,223
and she is awesome.

531
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:39,651
<i>All this, all this
is just so we can pick out</i>

532
00:58:39,653 --> 00:58:43,204
which one of you gets the honor.

533
00:58:57,137 --> 00:58:58,803
Huh.

534
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:02,307
Ugh, I gotta shave this shit.

535
00:59:08,899 --> 00:59:11,900
You got one of our guns.

536
00:59:15,488 --> 00:59:18,690
Whoa. Yeah.

537
00:59:18,692 --> 00:59:21,025
You got a lot of our guns.

538
00:59:24,364 --> 00:59:28,333
Shit, kid, lighten up.

539
00:59:29,953 --> 00:59:32,203
At least cry a little.

540
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:42,463
Ahem.

541
00:59:50,523 --> 00:59:52,890
Jesus.

542
00:59:52,892 --> 00:59:55,643
You look shitty.

543
00:59:57,447 --> 00:59:59,280
I should just put you
out of your misery right now.

544
00:59:59,282 --> 01:00:01,950
No! No!

545
01:00:01,952 --> 01:00:04,535
Stop it!

546
01:00:04,537 --> 01:00:08,623
God--!

547
01:00:08,625 --> 01:00:10,541
Nope.

548
01:00:10,543 --> 01:00:14,045
- Nope, get him back in line.
<i>- No.</i>

549
01:00:14,047 --> 01:00:16,831
No.

550
01:00:16,833 --> 01:00:18,082
<i>No.</i>

551
01:00:27,761 --> 01:00:30,011
Don't.

552
01:00:30,013 --> 01:00:31,479
<i>Don't.</i>

553
01:00:34,184 --> 01:00:36,901
All right, listen.

554
01:00:36,903 --> 01:00:40,855
Don't any of you do that again.

555
01:00:40,857 --> 01:00:44,525
I will shut that shit down,
no exceptions.

556
01:00:46,446 --> 01:00:47,912
First one's free.

557
01:00:47,914 --> 01:00:52,116
It's an emotional moment, I get it.

558
01:01:06,933 --> 01:01:09,467
Sucks, don't it?

559
01:01:09,469 --> 01:01:13,304
The moment you realize
you don't know shit.

560
01:01:28,288 --> 01:01:30,738
This is your kid, right?

561
01:01:35,328 --> 01:01:37,729
This is definitely your kid.

562
01:01:37,731 --> 01:01:40,882
- Just stop this!
- Hey!

563
01:01:40,884 --> 01:01:44,802
Do not make me kill the
little future serial killer.

564
01:01:44,804 --> 01:01:46,888
Don't make it easy on me.

565
01:01:48,842 --> 01:01:51,676
I gotta pick somebody.

566
01:01:51,678 --> 01:01:55,430
Everybody's at the table
waiting for me to order.

567
01:02:14,501 --> 01:02:17,668
I simply cannot decide.

568
01:02:23,843 --> 01:02:26,043
I got an idea.

569
01:02:34,137 --> 01:02:35,803
<i>Eenie...</i>

570
01:02:37,724 --> 01:02:39,474
<i>meenie...</i>

571
01:02:39,476 --> 01:02:41,559
<i>miney...</i>

572
01:02:43,863 --> 01:02:45,897
mo...

573
01:02:47,450 --> 01:02:49,484
catch...

574
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:53,037
<i>a tiger...</i>

575
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:55,790
by...

576
01:02:55,792 --> 01:02:57,875
<i>his toe.</i>

577
01:02:57,877 --> 01:03:00,161
If...

578
01:03:00,163 --> 01:03:03,414
he hollers...

579
01:03:03,416 --> 01:03:05,416
let him go.

580
01:03:07,137 --> 01:03:09,303
My mother...

581
01:03:09,305 --> 01:03:10,488
<i>told me...</i>

582
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:11,973
to pick

583
01:03:11,975 --> 01:03:16,344
<i>the very best one...</i>

584
01:03:16,346 --> 01:03:19,096
<i>and you...</i>

585
01:03:20,483 --> 01:03:23,100
are...

586
01:03:30,693 --> 01:03:33,077
it.

587
01:03:33,079 --> 01:03:35,112
Anybody moves, anybody says anything,

588
01:03:35,114 --> 01:03:37,782
cut the boy's other eye out
and feed it to his father

589
01:03:37,784 --> 01:03:39,834
and then we'll start.

590
01:03:39,836 --> 01:03:41,369
You can breathe,

591
01:03:41,371 --> 01:03:43,087
you can blink,

592
01:03:43,089 --> 01:03:45,173
you can cry.

593
01:03:45,175 --> 01:03:48,593
Hell, you're all gonna be doing that.

594
01:03:49,629 --> 01:03:53,798
Ho! Ho!

595
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:56,717
Look at that.

596
01:03:56,719 --> 01:03:59,937
Taking it like a champ!

597
01:04:02,041 --> 01:04:04,842
<i>Damn!</i>

598
01:04:14,649 --> 01:04:25,552
