AMC's The Walking Dead</i>

2
00:00:03,558 --> 00:00:05,019
I know you're scared.

3
00:00:05,187 --> 00:00:07,021
The wall's going
to hold together.

4
00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:08,022
Can you?

5
00:00:09,191 --> 00:00:10,951
I don't get to
know what will happen.

6
00:00:11,027 --> 00:00:12,192
I have to live with that.

7
00:00:12,295 --> 00:00:14,194
<i>The others,</i>
<i>they're gonna be back.</i>

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,246
<i>They're gonna be back.</i>

9
00:00:15,364 --> 00:00:17,197
So you wanna just
leave her out there?

10
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:18,198
She's your friend.

11
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:19,250
My girlfriend.

12
00:00:19,368 --> 00:00:21,252
I mean 'cause she
was anyway, right?

13
00:00:24,423 --> 00:00:27,541
<i>You have to protect everyone...</i>

14
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:29,743
<i>...to create peace.</i>

15
00:00:36,017 --> 00:00:37,551
<i>Thank you.</i>

16
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:18,445
<i>Hey, heads up!</i>

17
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,450
Shit.
I said heads up.

18
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:28,322
Enid?

19
00:03:49,011 --> 00:03:50,711
Enid.

20
00:03:50,713 --> 00:03:52,880
What are you doing out here?

21
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,951
<i>There's another water
bottle in the corner.</i>

22
00:03:57,953 --> 00:03:59,453
<i>Take it and go.</i>

23
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,925
You're not gonna answer me?

24
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,428
<i>No.</i>

25
00:04:44,266 --> 00:04:46,433
What happened in Alexandria?

26
00:04:49,905 --> 00:04:52,406
We heard that sound.

27
00:04:52,408 --> 00:04:54,241
The gunfire.

28
00:04:58,113 --> 00:04:59,880
Enid.

29
00:05:01,784 --> 00:05:05,185
<i>What happened is
what always happens.</i>

30
00:05:05,187 --> 00:05:07,287
<i>People died.</i>

31
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:09,823
The herd broke
through the walls?

32
00:05:09,825 --> 00:05:11,058
<i>What herd?</i>

33
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,026
The walkers.

34
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:14,728
They broke out
of the quarry early.

35
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,030
We got on them, but that
sound, the air horn,

36
00:05:17,032 --> 00:05:18,866
what was that?

37
00:05:18,868 --> 00:05:21,585
<i>It was people.</i>

38
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,570
<i>You should go.</i>

39
00:05:29,044 --> 00:05:31,345
My wife,

40
00:05:31,347 --> 00:05:33,780
Maggie,

41
00:05:33,782 --> 00:05:35,682
she okay?

42
00:05:39,054 --> 00:05:41,188
Enid?

43
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,241
Is Maggie okay?

44
00:05:47,563 --> 00:05:49,329
Answer me!

45
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:54,735
Enid.

46
00:05:55,838 --> 00:05:57,387
Enid!

47
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,108
Enid.

48
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:17,010
Hey, Enid!

49
00:06:33,642 --> 00:06:35,342
Enid!

00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,313
Morgan.

52
00:07:48,318 --> 00:07:50,802
Morning.

53
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,854
We haven't talked.
We should.

54
00:07:52,856 --> 00:07:54,922
<i>A little later, okay?</i>

55
00:07:54,924 --> 00:07:56,891
Okay.

56
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:45,807
You don't have to be
up here so much.

57
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:47,675
I won't be.

58
00:08:47,677 --> 00:08:50,628
This is the direction
he'd come in.

59
00:08:52,545 --> 00:08:55,513
If he sends up a signal,
it'll be from out there.

60
00:08:55,515 --> 00:08:57,765
Yeah.

61
00:08:57,767 --> 00:08:59,517
Or it-- it won't be.

62
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:05,640
When we go out there,

63
00:09:05,642 --> 00:09:08,192
it's never easy,
it's never simple.

64
00:09:08,194 --> 00:09:10,695
It's always a fight.

65
00:09:10,697 --> 00:09:13,764
But we've come back
from harder things.

66
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:16,100
From further away.

67
00:09:16,102 --> 00:09:20,238
Glenn, Daryl, Abraham, and
Sasha, they will, too.

68
00:09:25,512 --> 00:09:27,979
Maybe we don't wait
for them to be back.

69
00:09:29,782 --> 00:09:32,750
We should start figuring out
how to draw the walkers away.

70
00:09:32,752 --> 00:09:35,386
We have some food and
water to last us a while

71
00:09:35,388 --> 00:09:37,655
and the walls are holding.

72
00:09:37,657 --> 00:09:39,223
We can take our time.

73
00:09:39,225 --> 00:09:42,076
Really think this through.
Do it right.

74
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:46,113
Clear it so they can--
they can walk right in.

75
00:09:50,403 --> 00:09:53,838
I saw Judith in the house
the other day.

76
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,540
She's starting to--

77
00:09:58,595 --> 00:10:00,278
she's starting
to look like Lori.

78
00:10:01,481 --> 00:10:04,182
- Yeah.
- Made me happy.

79
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:07,118
Me, too.

80
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:03,167
Dad.

81
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,862
Handguns will be a little
better for your first go.

82
00:12:14,864 --> 00:12:19,316
Magazine release.
Slide release.

83
00:12:19,318 --> 00:12:21,285
Thumb safety.

84
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:22,819
That stuff's easy, right, Dad?

85
00:12:22,821 --> 00:12:26,557
Yeah.
Empty magazine.

86
00:12:28,827 --> 00:12:31,011
- Empty chamber. See it?
- Yeah.

87
00:12:32,915 --> 00:12:36,099
Someone's in front of you,
they have a gun.

88
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:39,586
You're gonna be scared.
You will be.

89
00:12:39,588 --> 00:12:43,740
Your body's gonna tense,
you won't have time to think.

90
00:12:43,742 --> 00:12:46,760
You're just gonna want to pull the
trigger when you get it in front of you.

91
00:12:48,814 --> 00:12:51,114
But you'll miss

92
00:12:51,116 --> 00:12:53,684
and you'll be dead.

93
00:12:53,686 --> 00:12:55,569
You have to get it
up to your eye.

94
00:12:57,356 --> 00:12:59,940
You've got to be strong enough
to wait for your moment.

95
00:13:03,495 --> 00:13:05,629
Can I, uh...?

96
00:13:12,054 --> 00:13:15,839
Hey, your finger doesn't
touch the trigger

97
00:13:15,841 --> 00:13:17,874
until you're ready to shoot.

98
00:13:28,387 --> 00:13:30,320
Keep that one with you.

99
00:13:30,322 --> 00:13:32,990
Get a feel of what it's
like to carry one around.

100
00:13:32,992 --> 00:13:35,459
Can I shoot it?

101
00:13:35,461 --> 00:13:38,462
Maybe like down at the walkers?

102
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:40,414
<i>No, with things how they are,</i>

103
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,199
<i>the walls are strong,</i>

104
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:44,201
<i>but we're lucky the
walkers are spread out.</i>

105
00:13:44,203 --> 00:13:46,236
We don't want to pull
them all to one spot.

106
00:13:46,238 --> 00:13:48,772
Well, what about, like, target
practice in the center of town?

107
00:13:48,774 --> 00:13:51,575
'Cause then the sound will
spread out in each direction.

108
00:13:51,577 --> 00:13:54,017
<i>Or maybe we could use, like,
silencers or something like that.</i>

109
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:02,953
But, uh...

110
00:14:02,955 --> 00:14:06,290
I mean, we probably don't want
to waste bullets right now, huh?

111
00:14:11,363 --> 00:14:13,330
Just want to learn more.

112
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,400
You will.

113
00:14:33,452 --> 00:14:35,786
Hey.
Sorry.

114
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:37,521
I was making--

115
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,124
you want some oatmeal?

116
00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:45,729
Thank you.
I'm-- I'm okay.

117
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:48,365
You were coming to the door.
What's up?

118
00:14:52,705 --> 00:14:54,705
Want me to take
a look at your arm?

119
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:56,690
No, I'm not here for--

120
00:14:59,645 --> 00:15:01,678
I'm fine.

121
00:15:03,565 --> 00:15:06,049
You can tell me if you're not.

122
00:15:13,175 --> 00:15:14,941
Morgan.

123
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,760
<i>Can we talk now?</i>

124
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:18,562
Uh-huh.

125
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,301
What's going on?

126
00:15:24,303 --> 00:15:26,803
When I was coming back...

127
00:15:28,824 --> 00:15:32,159
I tried to cut off
the herd with the RV.

128
00:15:32,161 --> 00:15:34,961
Lead the walkers away.

129
00:15:34,963 --> 00:15:38,281
But five of those people with
the Ws in their foreheads,

130
00:15:38,283 --> 00:15:40,784
they stopped me.

131
00:15:40,786 --> 00:15:43,820
They tried to kill me,
shot up the RV.

132
00:15:46,008 --> 00:15:49,826
Now, Carol says she saw you.

133
00:15:49,828 --> 00:15:51,828
That you wouldn't
kill those people.

134
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,164
Did you let any of them go?

135
00:15:56,235 --> 00:15:57,751
Yes, I did.

136
00:16:01,507 --> 00:16:03,907
I didn't want to kill five
people I didn't have to kill.

137
00:16:03,908 --> 00:16:05,076
They burned people alive.

138
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:06,794
Yeah.

139
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,641
Why didn't you kill me, Rick,

140
00:16:20,643 --> 00:16:22,876
back in King County?

141
00:16:22,878 --> 00:16:25,462
Pulled a knife on you.
I stabbed you.

142
00:16:25,464 --> 00:16:27,381
So why didn't you kill me?

143
00:16:27,383 --> 00:16:29,216
Was it 'cause I saved you
after the hospital?

144
00:16:29,218 --> 00:16:30,918
'Cause I knew who you were.

145
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,954
Back there I would have killed
you as soon as look at you.

146
00:16:33,956 --> 00:16:36,123
And I tried.

147
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,075
But you, you let me live

148
00:16:38,077 --> 00:16:40,878
and then I was there
to help Aaron and Daryl.

149
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:47,334
See, if I--
if I wasn't there...

150
00:16:49,738 --> 00:16:51,672
if they died...

151
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:59,580
maybe those wolves wouldn't have
been able to come back here.

152
00:17:01,984 --> 00:17:04,318
I don't know
what's right anymore.

153
00:17:06,797 --> 00:17:09,389
'Cause I did want
to kill those men.

154
00:17:09,391 --> 00:17:12,059
I seen what they did,
what they keep doing.

155
00:17:13,596 --> 00:17:15,863
I knew I could end it.

156
00:17:20,136 --> 00:17:22,753
But I also know
that people can change.

157
00:17:25,508 --> 00:17:28,675
'Cause everyone
sitting here has.

158
00:17:28,677 --> 00:17:31,778
All life is precious.

159
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,114
And that idea--
that idea changed me.

160
00:17:34,116 --> 00:17:36,383
It brought me back
and it keeps me living.

161
00:17:36,385 --> 00:17:38,252
I just don't think
it can be that easy.

162
00:17:38,254 --> 00:17:40,020
- It's not easy.
- I wasn't saying--

163
00:17:40,022 --> 00:17:42,489
I-- I know.

164
00:17:42,491 --> 00:17:45,325
And I've thought about
letting that idea go.

165
00:17:45,327 --> 00:17:47,661
But I don't want to.

166
00:17:47,663 --> 00:17:49,196
You may have to.

167
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:54,101
Things aren't as simple
as four words.

168
00:17:54,103 --> 00:17:56,286
I don't think they ever were.

169
00:17:56,288 --> 00:17:58,639
Do you think
I don't belong here?

170
00:17:58,641 --> 00:18:01,892
Making it now,

171
00:18:01,894 --> 00:18:03,794
do you really think
you can do that

172
00:18:03,796 --> 00:18:05,812
without getting blood
on your hands?

173
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,554
I don't know.

174
00:18:50,007 --> 00:18:52,608
If we can somehow
get outside the walls,

175
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:55,094
get back to our cars
at the quarry,

176
00:18:55,096 --> 00:18:56,879
we could use them
to draw them away.

177
00:18:56,881 --> 00:18:59,181
We'll set up more watch points.

178
00:18:59,183 --> 00:19:01,033
Coordinate the shooting
of guns and flares

179
00:19:01,035 --> 00:19:03,952
so we could pull them out
in even directions.

180
00:19:03,954 --> 00:19:05,845
We'd need to get
all our people on it.

181
00:19:05,965 --> 00:19:09,458
Carl, Tara, Rosita, Carol.

182
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,427
What about everybody else?

183
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:14,330
Well, let's just keep
this to our own for now.

184
00:19:14,332 --> 00:19:16,065
Really?

185
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:20,069
Look, if we had the time to
bring the people along, sure.

186
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:22,671
But we haven't had
a chance to catch our breath.

187
00:19:24,241 --> 00:19:26,175
Really?

188
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,246
We're in here together.

189
00:19:31,248 --> 00:19:33,415
We're catching
our breath right now.

190
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:37,086
Anything else is just excuses.

191
00:19:43,694 --> 00:19:45,594
Deanna.

192
00:19:45,613 --> 00:19:47,463
<i>Rick.</i>

193
00:19:47,465 --> 00:19:49,682
What's that?

194
00:19:49,684 --> 00:19:53,336
Plans for the expansion.

195
00:19:53,338 --> 00:19:55,971
We got a few other things
on our plate right now.

196
00:19:55,973 --> 00:19:58,891
I know.

197
00:19:58,893 --> 00:20:02,495
These are for what Alexandria
can be after this.

198
00:20:02,497 --> 00:20:04,146
Because one way or another,

199
00:20:04,148 --> 00:20:06,582
there's gonna be an after this.

200
00:20:13,074 --> 00:20:16,042
Now, when the blade connects,
don't jerk it right back.

201
00:20:16,044 --> 00:20:18,511
- You'll get stuck.
<i>- Stuck?</i>

202
00:20:18,513 --> 00:20:20,463
Like an ax cutting into a tree.

203
00:20:20,465 --> 00:20:22,148
It's easier to get a blade
into bone than out.

204
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,884
So what should we do?

205
00:20:24,886 --> 00:20:26,919
You should slide the machete
down through the wound.

206
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:28,554
One fluid motion.

207
00:20:28,556 --> 00:20:31,240
Okay, you ease it through
the bone like this.

208
00:20:31,242 --> 00:20:33,843
<i>All right?</i>

209
00:20:43,004 --> 00:20:44,970
Hey!

210
00:20:44,972 --> 00:20:48,090
I'm a weapons novice holding
a significant blade here

211
00:20:48,092 --> 00:20:50,393
and there are people in my
proximity with open-toed shoes.

212
00:20:50,395 --> 00:20:53,079
That's right.
So get a grip.

213
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:00,820
What are you so scared of?

214
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,356
That would be dying.

215
00:21:04,358 --> 00:21:06,125
Dying is simple.

216
00:21:06,127 --> 00:21:09,178
It all just stops.
You're dead.

217
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,831
The people around you dying,

218
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,732
that's the hard part.

219
00:21:15,002 --> 00:21:16,619
Okay? 'Cause you keep living

220
00:21:16,621 --> 00:21:20,573
<i>knowing that they're gone</i>

221
00:21:20,575 --> 00:21:22,441
<i>and you're still here.</i>

222
00:21:24,178 --> 00:21:27,713
What you should
be scared of is living

223
00:21:27,715 --> 00:21:31,250
knowing that you didn't do everything
you could to keep them here.

224
00:21:34,355 --> 00:21:36,439
Too upset to keep going?

225
00:21:37,792 --> 00:21:39,458
Are the noises scaring you

226
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,477
or can I get back to my lesson?

227
00:21:47,301 --> 00:21:48,901
Let's try this again.

228
00:22:23,704 --> 00:22:26,105
Shh!

229
00:22:26,107 --> 00:22:27,673
The hell are you doing?

230
00:22:27,675 --> 00:22:29,942
Shh.

231
00:22:29,944 --> 00:22:31,677
I'm taking you home.

232
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,679
I don't know you.

233
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:38,250
Why did you give me water?

234
00:22:39,904 --> 00:22:41,804
I had it, you needed it.

235
00:22:41,806 --> 00:22:44,023
That doesn't make us friends.

236
00:22:44,025 --> 00:22:46,926
We're not friends.
I'm doing this for Maggie.

237
00:22:46,928 --> 00:22:48,594
Your wife?

238
00:22:48,596 --> 00:22:51,330
She wouldn't leave you behind.

239
00:22:51,332 --> 00:22:53,232
She wouldn't want me
to leave you behind.

240
00:22:53,234 --> 00:22:55,668
So we're going.

241
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,536
I'm not friends
with your wife either.

242
00:22:57,538 --> 00:23:00,506
I'm not having
this conversation.

243
00:23:00,508 --> 00:23:02,608
I'm not leaving you out here.

244
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,059
We're going now.

245
00:23:04,061 --> 00:23:06,111
No.

246
00:23:22,347 --> 00:23:24,782
Give me the gun, Enid.

247
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:28,886
Turn around and walk away.

248
00:23:31,624 --> 00:23:33,490
You're not gonna
pull the trigger.

249
00:23:33,492 --> 00:23:35,693
I will if you make me.

250
00:23:39,665 --> 00:23:41,432
Let go.

251
00:23:43,469 --> 00:23:46,186
Asshole.

252
00:23:46,188 --> 00:23:48,305
You point a gun at me
and I'm the asshole?

253
00:23:53,012 --> 00:23:54,645
Let's go.

254
00:23:54,647 --> 00:23:56,714
Out the back down the alley.

255
00:23:56,716 --> 00:23:58,399
We're taking the road.
We need visibility.

256
00:23:58,401 --> 00:24:01,151
<i>Why?</i>

257
00:24:01,153 --> 00:24:03,287
Because half the herd broke off

258
00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:05,022
and they're headed towards home.

259
00:24:06,475 --> 00:24:08,225
I guess you missed that.

260
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:11,995
Lead the way.

261
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,477
You look like
you could use some help.

262
00:25:05,651 --> 00:25:10,254
You know, I think we could build
up a brace on this thing.

263
00:25:32,178 --> 00:25:33,610
<i>What?</i>

264
00:25:38,617 --> 00:25:41,151
Think your wife wouldn't
have wanted me to kill it?

265
00:26:06,612 --> 00:26:08,779
We can use them
to distract them.

266
00:26:13,686 --> 00:26:15,869
There's a helium tank
in those shrubs.

267
00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:18,956
More balloons, more string.

268
00:26:38,911 --> 00:26:41,778
It don't mean anything
as long as we keep this up.

269
00:26:45,985 --> 00:26:49,253
You know, you scared the hell out
of people when we first saw you.

270
00:26:49,255 --> 00:26:50,921
I know.

271
00:26:54,376 --> 00:26:56,460
You scared the hell out of me.

272
00:26:56,462 --> 00:26:59,329
With that beard.

273
00:26:59,331 --> 00:27:01,298
The way you looked around

274
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,534
like you were seeing
things we weren't...

275
00:27:04,536 --> 00:27:07,271
hiding around corners.

276
00:27:07,273 --> 00:27:09,039
Turns out you were.

277
00:27:13,579 --> 00:27:17,581
Things moved slow here.

278
00:27:19,668 --> 00:27:23,120
And then things
just started moving fast.

279
00:27:23,122 --> 00:27:24,655
Too fast.

280
00:27:26,275 --> 00:27:28,692
But don't give up on us.

281
00:27:40,472 --> 00:27:42,339
Who did you stay with back home?

282
00:27:43,842 --> 00:27:45,809
It's not my home.

283
00:27:51,483 --> 00:27:53,817
I lived in Olivia's place.

284
00:27:55,087 --> 00:27:58,422
But I was on my own.

285
00:28:00,142 --> 00:28:02,292
Orphaned by walkers.

286
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,133
Me, too.

287
00:28:10,135 --> 00:28:12,102
Probably.

288
00:28:14,606 --> 00:28:16,573
It's just what happens.

289
00:28:29,355 --> 00:28:31,088
I get that you're scared.

290
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:33,256
I'm not scared.

291
00:28:33,258 --> 00:28:35,726
Yeah, you are.

292
00:28:35,728 --> 00:28:37,861
You don't want
to lose anything again,

293
00:28:37,863 --> 00:28:41,999
so you give up and you say,
"That's just what happens."

294
00:28:42,001 --> 00:28:45,268
- I don't need a lecture.
- <i> Yeah, I think you do.</i>

295
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:48,271
You honor the dead by going on.

296
00:28:49,675 --> 00:28:51,541
Even when you're scared.

297
00:28:53,228 --> 00:28:55,812
You live because
they don't get to.

298
00:28:57,683 --> 00:28:59,950
You think your parents
wanted you

299
00:28:59,952 --> 00:29:01,985
waving around a gun
because you're afraid?

300
00:29:01,987 --> 00:29:03,720
We don't have to talk.

301
00:29:10,129 --> 00:29:11,962
We don't have to talk.

302
00:29:32,301 --> 00:29:34,317
Crap.

303
00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:11,516
My God.

304
00:30:29,698 --> 00:30:31,364
Stop.

305
00:30:32,751 --> 00:30:34,367
I said stop.

306
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:36,419
What's the point?

307
00:30:41,343 --> 00:30:43,626
The world is trying to die.

308
00:30:46,214 --> 00:30:48,598
We're supposed to just let it.

309
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,051
No.

310
00:30:51,053 --> 00:30:53,303
You're wrong.

311
00:30:53,305 --> 00:30:54,971
We're not supposed
to let the world die.

312
00:30:56,691 --> 00:30:59,776
And I sure as hell
am not gonna let you die.

313
00:30:59,778 --> 00:31:02,395
I'm sure your wife
will forgive you.

314
00:31:02,397 --> 00:31:04,147
It's not for her anymore.

315
00:31:06,485 --> 00:31:09,069
Look, the walls are still up.

316
00:31:09,071 --> 00:31:11,654
The houses are still up.

317
00:31:11,656 --> 00:31:13,740
We'll find out the rest.

318
00:31:15,077 --> 00:31:16,960
Okay?

319
00:31:27,055 --> 00:31:29,005
What the hell?

320
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,433
<i>Spencer.</i>

321
00:31:40,435 --> 00:31:43,520
Hey, Spencer, get back here!

322
00:31:45,857 --> 00:31:47,023
Tara.

323
00:31:51,029 --> 00:31:52,112
Spencer.

324
00:31:53,281 --> 00:31:55,281
Spencer, get back here now.

325
00:31:58,753 --> 00:32:01,171
Spencer.
Spencer, move!

326
00:32:12,217 --> 00:32:14,267
<i>Go! Keep moving!</i>

327
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:16,269
- <i> Hurry!</i>
- Eugene...

328
00:32:16,271 --> 00:32:18,354
have Maggie and Rosita fire their
guns out from their posts.

329
00:32:18,356 --> 00:32:20,440
- Why?
- Just do it!

330
00:32:20,442 --> 00:32:23,476
- Tara, I cannot in good conscience--
- Just do it!

331
00:32:31,203 --> 00:32:32,735
Spencer, come on!

332
00:33:11,109 --> 00:33:12,942
Grab on!

333
00:33:20,619 --> 00:33:25,038
Tara! You almost died
once for these people.

334
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,372
What?

335
00:33:26,374 --> 00:33:27,924
What the hell were you doing?

336
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:33,463
Lost a damn shoe.
Crap.

337
00:33:35,133 --> 00:33:37,467
What was that?

338
00:33:37,469 --> 00:33:40,853
I was trying to help. I wanted
to get to a car, draw them away.

339
00:33:40,855 --> 00:33:44,274
You ever make a climb
like that before?

340
00:33:46,945 --> 00:33:49,946
You want to help? Don't make
us come running to save you.

341
00:33:49,948 --> 00:33:52,649
You got an idea, you come to me.

342
00:33:52,651 --> 00:33:55,485
Would you have listened to me?

343
00:34:07,229 --> 00:34:09,446
Everything okay now?

344
00:34:09,448 --> 00:34:11,114
It's handled.

345
00:34:12,985 --> 00:34:15,118
Everything's fine.

346
00:34:26,651 --> 00:34:27,814
Cheat sheets.

347
00:34:32,538 --> 00:34:34,838
Yeah.

348
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,374
Probably doesn't
give you a lot of faith.

349
00:34:37,376 --> 00:34:39,659
I have faith.

350
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:42,045
Well, you have to, right?

351
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:44,514
You don't have to.
I choose to.

352
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:48,185
You should, too.

353
00:34:48,187 --> 00:34:51,121
So are you gonna tell me
why you're here this time?

354
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:56,343
How well is the community
stocked with antibiotics?

355
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:59,196
We're good.

356
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:02,699
I need to dress a wound,

357
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:04,634
but I don't know
if it's infected.

358
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:06,570
I don't want to waste
medicine if I don't have to.

359
00:35:06,572 --> 00:35:08,138
FWoPP'RS.

360
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:11,174
Fever, warmth, pus,
pain, redness...

361
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:16,346
um...

362
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:18,482
Tell me what it is.

363
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:24,287
Swelling.

364
00:35:28,277 --> 00:35:29,926
Let's take a look at your arm.

365
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,296
I didn't come in this morning

366
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:35,265
because I didn't want to get
you involved in something

367
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:38,368
that you may not want
to be involved in.

368
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,470
<i>In a secret.</i>

369
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:46,526
It's not my wound.

370
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,668
- Hi.
- Hey.

371
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,486
I know you just took care
of Judith this morning,

372
00:36:46,488 --> 00:36:48,138
but they want some help
with the watch points

373
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,773
after that thing with Spencer.
Could you...?

374
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:51,174
Oh, yeah, no problem.

375
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:52,509
Unless you want me
to take your shift.

376
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:53,843
No, I like being up there.

377
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,680
Even with all them outside?

378
00:36:56,682 --> 00:37:00,116
You can see everything.
Even inside.

379
00:37:00,118 --> 00:37:02,485
Um, let me just lock these up.

380
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:03,920
- Can you give me a second?
- Mm-hmm.

381
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:05,488
- Do you want to come in?
- Yeah.

382
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:18,702
<i>Carol?</i>

383
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,939
Carol.

384
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:25,375
What, Sam?

385
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:29,679
Sam?

386
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:33,316
What happens if you
can't live with it?

387
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:36,519
I told you, it eats you up.

388
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:38,888
Can you come down here?
I can barely hear you.

389
00:37:40,909 --> 00:37:43,927
The people who came,

390
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,929
were they the monsters?

391
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:50,383
<i>Did my dad turn into one?</i>

392
00:37:50,385 --> 00:37:52,035
What?

393
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:54,504
If you kill people,

394
00:37:54,506 --> 00:37:57,223
do you turn into
one of the monsters?

395
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:02,746
The only thing that keeps you from
becoming a monster is killing.

396
00:38:15,477 --> 00:38:18,445
- Thank you for this.
- Oh, yeah, no problem.

397
00:38:18,447 --> 00:38:21,131
Yeah.
Bye-bye.

398
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:33,009
Who the hell do you
have in that cell?

399
00:39:20,258 --> 00:39:22,692
Hey, you seen Denise?

400
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,060
No.

401
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:31,668
I'll be right back.

402
00:39:34,523 --> 00:39:36,573
Hey.

403
00:39:36,575 --> 00:39:38,975
Look, I'm sorry about before.

404
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:41,678
- I was just--
- He was stupid. That we know.

405
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,398
I just meant what you did for
him, you didn't have to.

406
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,617
I know.

407
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:49,519
You could have died.

408
00:39:49,521 --> 00:39:52,021
I mean, I'd like to say
I was thinking about it,

409
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:54,057
but I wasn't.

410
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:56,392
Is that why you did it?

411
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,228
You weren't thinking about it?

412
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:03,733
No, that's how it works with us.

413
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,702
We're stuck with
each other, right?

414
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:09,939
<i>Rick, you saved my son.</i>

415
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:12,375
Thank you.

416
00:40:12,377 --> 00:40:14,444
Thank Tara.

417
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:16,212
I already did.

418
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,451
Now I'm thanking you.

419
00:40:22,771 --> 00:40:25,588
What Spencer did was stupid.

420
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,724
I can't argue that.

421
00:40:27,726 --> 00:40:30,627
- At least he tried.
- That's not the point.

422
00:40:30,629 --> 00:40:32,896
I could have tried.

423
00:40:32,898 --> 00:40:34,881
There was a chance.

424
00:40:34,883 --> 00:40:36,900
How's that?

425
00:40:36,902 --> 00:40:40,403
When the walkers were going
for him, it made a gap.

426
00:40:40,405 --> 00:40:42,906
I could have jumped down,
ran, made it out.

427
00:40:42,908 --> 00:40:44,807
I could have got in a car,

428
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,459
used it to lead
the walkers away.

429
00:40:46,461 --> 00:40:49,546
I could have done that
and Spencer would be dead.

430
00:40:49,548 --> 00:40:52,182
But you didn't do that.

431
00:40:52,184 --> 00:40:54,000
Why?

432
00:40:55,654 --> 00:40:57,954
I helped save him
because he's your son.

433
00:41:00,141 --> 00:41:02,075
Wrong answer.

434
00:41:45,787 --> 00:41:47,900
That's Glenn.
That's Glenn.

435
00:42:02,538 --> 00:42:08,701
