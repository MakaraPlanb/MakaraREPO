1
00:00:00,587 --> 00:00:03,254
Previously on AMC's The Walking Dead...

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,722
There's a horn or something!

3
00:00:05,357 --> 00:00:06,490
Half of them broke off.

4
00:00:06,575 --> 00:00:07,855
They're going towards Alexandria.

5
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:08,909
You keep going!

6
00:00:09,027 --> 00:00:10,207
I'll get the RV.

7
00:00:10,327 --> 00:00:11,912
I'll get in front of them
before they get there.

8
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:12,913
I can lead them away again.

9
00:00:13,031 --> 00:00:14,531
You just get home.

10
00:00:17,419 --> 00:00:18,452
Come inside.

11
00:00:18,537 --> 00:00:20,403
I can keep you safe.

12
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:24,207
Up here!

13
00:00:24,343 --> 00:00:25,375
Nicholas, don't!

14
00:00:25,511 --> 00:00:26,543
Look at me!

15
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:24,668
The town was overrun.

16
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,137
He split off with Nicholas.

17
00:01:27,139 --> 00:01:30,557
He had this idea that...

18
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:34,311
if he lit a fire, it would stop
the walkers from coming here.

19
00:01:35,347 --> 00:01:37,981
I tried to go instead.

20
00:01:37,983 --> 00:01:40,517
I wanted to.

21
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:42,485
The fire never got lit.

22
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:46,690
We had to keep going.

23
00:01:47,826 --> 00:01:49,776
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:54,281
He said if he got stuck,

25
00:01:54,283 --> 00:01:56,249
he would find a way to send us a signal.

26
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:57,667
A signal?

27
00:01:57,669 --> 00:01:59,619
Open the gate!

28
00:02:05,177 --> 00:02:06,676
Open the gate!

29
00:02:25,697 --> 00:02:29,899
Open the gate now!

30
00:03:32,168 --> 00:03:42,845

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

31
00:04:13,283 --> 00:04:14,783
You can hear it.

32
00:04:16,253 --> 00:04:18,954
Some of you saw it.

33
00:04:18,956 --> 00:04:22,791
They got back here, half of them.

34
00:04:22,793 --> 00:04:25,877
Still enough to surround us 20 deep.

35
00:04:29,049 --> 00:04:31,079
Look, I know you're scared.

36
00:04:31,823 --> 00:04:34,824
You haven't seen anything like this.

37
00:04:34,826 --> 00:04:38,044
You haven't been through
anything like this.

38
00:04:38,046 --> 00:04:40,830
But we're safe for now.

39
00:04:43,502 --> 00:04:47,003
The panel the truck hit seems intact.

40
00:04:47,005 --> 00:04:48,922
We reinforced it just in case.

41
00:04:48,924 --> 00:04:52,175
Either way, the wall's gonna hold together.

42
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,180
Can you?

43
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,684
The others, they're gonna be back.

44
00:05:01,686 --> 00:05:03,353
They're gonna be back.

45
00:05:06,825 --> 00:05:12,362
Daryl, Abraham, Sasha, they have vehicles.

46
00:05:12,364 --> 00:05:15,448
They're gonna lead 'em
away, just like the others.

47
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,868
And Glenn and Nicholas are gonna walk
back through the front gate after.

48
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,870
They know what they're doing,

49
00:05:20,872 --> 00:05:24,207
and we know what we need to do.

50
00:05:25,377 --> 00:05:27,760
We keep noise to a minimum.

51
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:29,429
Pull our blinds at night.

52
00:05:29,431 --> 00:05:32,715
Even better, keep the lights out.

53
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,722
We'll try to make this place as quiet
as a graveyard, see if they move on.

54
00:05:39,724 --> 00:05:41,941
This place is a graveyard.

55
00:05:51,536 --> 00:05:54,370
The quarry broke open

56
00:05:54,372 --> 00:05:57,290
and those walkers were heading this way.

57
00:05:57,292 --> 00:05:59,909
All of them.

58
00:06:01,913 --> 00:06:04,914
The plan that Rick put into place

59
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,300
stopped that from happening.

60
00:06:07,302 --> 00:06:09,636
He got half of them away.

61
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:17,260
I was out there recruiting with Daryl.

62
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:23,099
I wanted to try to get
into a cannery and scavenge,

63
00:06:23,101 --> 00:06:26,653
and Daryl wanted to
keep looking for people.

64
00:06:28,106 --> 00:06:29,856
We did what I wanted...

65
00:06:31,943 --> 00:06:34,611
and we wound up in a
trap set by those people.

66
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:36,996
And I lost my pack.

67
00:06:36,998 --> 00:06:39,866
They must've followed our tracks.

68
00:06:39,868 --> 00:06:42,001
Those people who attacked us...

69
00:06:45,674 --> 00:06:47,957
they found their way
back here because of me.

70
00:07:02,774 --> 00:07:04,807
There'll be more to talk about.

71
00:07:07,612 --> 00:07:09,145
Deanna?

72
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:16,069
Deanna?

73
00:08:27,776 --> 00:08:29,475
Don't.

74
00:08:34,983 --> 00:08:37,450
We don't bury killers inside the walls.

75
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,491
We aren't going out there.

76
00:08:45,493 --> 00:08:46,993
So what do we do?

77
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:52,248
We wait.

78
00:08:57,088 --> 00:08:59,055
I can't even make two meals out of this.

79
00:08:59,057 --> 00:09:02,475
The soups and sauces can be
stretched out with some extra water.

80
00:09:02,477 --> 00:09:06,145
What difference does that
make if we'll be dead tomorrow?

81
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:10,099
- We have to ration now...
- I can't.

82
00:09:10,101 --> 00:09:14,654
I can't spend whatever time I have
left watching my family starve.

83
00:09:14,656 --> 00:09:16,522
- Wait.
- I'm sorry.

84
00:09:19,444 --> 00:09:22,078
Sorry, Olivia. I just don't see the point.

85
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:29,786
Hey. Hey!

86
00:09:29,788 --> 00:09:31,370
Stop.

87
00:09:31,372 --> 00:09:33,539
Right now, stop it.

88
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,875
This stuff is for everyone.

89
00:09:35,877 --> 00:09:38,211
We need to make it last
if we're gonna survive.

90
00:09:38,213 --> 00:09:41,180
Why don't you go make sure
the gate's closed, Spencer?

91
00:09:41,182 --> 00:09:43,966
Yeah. That was me.

92
00:09:43,968 --> 00:09:45,435
I did that.

93
00:09:47,188 --> 00:09:50,973
But that truck outside the walls,

94
00:09:50,975 --> 00:09:54,143
it'd be inside if it wasn't for me.

95
00:09:54,145 --> 00:09:56,479
I did that, too.

96
00:09:56,481 --> 00:10:00,650
If I didn't, maybe we
wouldn't be talking right now.

97
00:10:02,654 --> 00:10:04,487
Where were you, Bruce?

98
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,711
Doing this will start us down
a road where nothing matters.

99
00:10:12,881 --> 00:10:15,298
Where no one else matters.

100
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:20,670
And then we'll all look
back at this moment right now

101
00:10:20,672 --> 00:10:22,889
as when we destroyed this place.

102
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:05,932
You're going out?

103
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,557
The flashlights, the rebar, the rope.

104
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:19,112
You lower them off the
wall a good distance apart,

105
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:21,064
maybe spin them.

106
00:12:21,066 --> 00:12:24,117
That way, the walkers are drawn to each one

107
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:26,035
and you open up a path.

108
00:12:31,826 --> 00:12:33,409
Now you're gearing up.

109
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:37,413
Just waiting for dark, right?

110
00:12:41,252 --> 00:12:45,972
What happens when you
twist an ankle jumping down?

111
00:12:47,092 --> 00:12:49,175
Hmm?

112
00:12:49,177 --> 00:12:51,427
Or you just get slowed down by one of them

113
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:53,262
and then you have to deal with all of them?

114
00:12:56,518 --> 00:12:58,151
I can't let you do this.

115
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:02,271
You can't stop me.

116
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,661
I'm going to help you.

117
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,286
And I know a safer way out.

118
00:14:29,694 --> 00:14:32,195
- Spencer?
- Yeah.

119
00:14:32,197 --> 00:14:34,664
I...

120
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,165
My bad.

121
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,120
Are you drunk?

122
00:14:41,122 --> 00:14:42,622
Getting there.

123
00:14:49,881 --> 00:14:51,881
This came from the pantry.

124
00:14:56,638 --> 00:14:58,855
You... you stole it?

125
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:00,473
I wouldn't call it that.

126
00:15:05,897 --> 00:15:07,814
So what you told everyone...

127
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,702
that was just bullshit?

128
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:16,038
No. If they all went
in and raided the pantry

129
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,542
and everyone knew it, saw it,

130
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,711
then that would be the end.

131
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:24,413
But one person?

132
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:27,583
One person, and no one ever would know.

133
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,922
So, why not me?

134
00:15:32,924 --> 00:15:34,807
I stopped that little run at the bank.

135
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,309
I deserve a reward.

136
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:39,762
One last celebration.

137
00:15:39,764 --> 00:15:42,815
Because they were right, Mom,

138
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:45,902
and you know it.

139
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:48,104
We're all gonna be dead real soon.

140
00:15:48,106 --> 00:15:49,605
Damn it, Spencer!

141
00:15:49,607 --> 00:15:50,823
Me?

142
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,775
Now that is some bullshit!

143
00:15:52,777 --> 00:15:54,944
You're the reason we're so screwed.

144
00:15:54,946 --> 00:15:56,579
You made us this way.

145
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,447
We were never safe here.

146
00:15:58,449 --> 00:15:59,949
But you didn't want to see that.

147
00:15:59,951 --> 00:16:01,250
You didn't want us to see that.

148
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,586
You just wanted to dream.

149
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:07,590
What happened to Dad, to Aiden,

150
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,008
that's all you.

151
00:16:50,084 --> 00:16:52,001
Hey.

152
00:16:53,671 --> 00:16:55,838
You okay?

153
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,757
Why wouldn't I be?

154
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,429
Have you seen Enid?

155
00:17:03,431 --> 00:17:06,732
Not since I saw her with you.

156
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,151
I think she went over the
wall just before the herd came

157
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,604
and now she's trapped out there.

158
00:17:11,606 --> 00:17:13,356
What makes you think she isn't dead?

159
00:17:13,358 --> 00:17:14,607
Come on, man.

160
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,200
Look...

161
00:17:24,202 --> 00:17:25,701
I'll go find her.

162
00:17:25,703 --> 00:17:27,503
I just need your help.

163
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:29,705
- If you maybe climb up...
- I'm not helping you, Carl.

164
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,759
This isn't for me.

165
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,761
It's for Enid.

166
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,598
- Your friend.
- My girlfriend.

167
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,466
Or, I mean, 'cause she was anyway, right?

168
00:17:40,468 --> 00:17:41,767
So you want to just leave her out there?

169
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,386
I told her to stop going over the wall,

170
00:17:43,388 --> 00:17:45,137
I told her there's bad people out there

171
00:17:45,139 --> 00:17:46,889
and that it's stupid and dangerous.

172
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:48,608
Not if you know what you're doing.

173
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:54,480
Well, I'm not gonna let you go.

174
00:17:54,482 --> 00:17:56,482
Carl.

175
00:17:56,484 --> 00:17:58,284
Carl, you're not going out there.

176
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:00,202
Back off.

177
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:04,073
All right.

178
00:18:10,081 --> 00:18:12,248
I'll tell your dad.

179
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,584
He'll go out there to find you,
then other people will, too.

180
00:18:15,586 --> 00:18:17,920
And then somebody's gonna die.

181
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,924
Huh?

182
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:26,679
You saved my life and now I'm saving yours.

183
00:19:04,887 --> 00:19:06,837
Sorry.

184
00:19:08,007 --> 00:19:09,423
Got away from me.

185
00:19:09,425 --> 00:19:11,026
You're still here.

186
00:19:12,462 --> 00:19:14,344
Don't.

187
00:19:14,346 --> 00:19:16,513
'Kay.

188
00:19:16,515 --> 00:19:18,155
Won't tell you you're being brave, either.

189
00:19:22,354 --> 00:19:26,273
He hasn't woken up. His wound's infected.

190
00:19:26,275 --> 00:19:28,275
I don't know what the hell to do,

191
00:19:28,277 --> 00:19:31,695
so it doesn't really matter what I'm being.

192
00:19:31,697 --> 00:19:33,697
Yeah, but you're still here.

193
00:19:35,617 --> 00:19:37,451
Why are you here?

194
00:19:37,453 --> 00:19:38,869
My head hurts.

195
00:19:41,957 --> 00:19:43,924
On a scale of one to 10, how bad?

196
00:19:43,926 --> 00:19:45,876
I'm lying.

197
00:19:45,878 --> 00:19:48,595
I'm just checking on you.

198
00:19:48,597 --> 00:19:50,680
Well...

199
00:19:53,552 --> 00:19:54,801
here I am.

200
00:19:54,803 --> 00:19:58,271
Clueless on the floor.

201
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:02,109
You patched people up.

202
00:20:02,111 --> 00:20:05,145
You're helping make things better.

203
00:20:05,147 --> 00:20:08,065
I think he's gonna die.

204
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:11,701
And I'm so scared about
what's happening in here

205
00:20:11,703 --> 00:20:15,238
that I can't think about
what's happening out there.

206
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,574
And that's actually good.

207
00:20:17,576 --> 00:20:20,577
And I don't know what to do with that.

208
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:23,797
I just want him to live and
for the roamers to go away.

209
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:26,383
And for a doctor to show up at the gates

210
00:20:26,385 --> 00:20:28,085
so I can go back to my apartment

211
00:20:28,087 --> 00:20:30,420
and keep reading "War and Peace."

212
00:20:32,257 --> 00:20:35,142
But here comes the end of the world.

213
00:20:36,261 --> 00:20:38,595
He's not dead yet.

214
00:20:38,597 --> 00:20:40,931
I don't know about that.

215
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,237
It's not like I don't feel it.

216
00:20:49,775 --> 00:20:51,858
You know, being afraid sucks.

217
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:18,862
I used to not want to see...

218
00:22:19,998 --> 00:22:21,948
the way things are.

219
00:22:25,204 --> 00:22:27,370
It's not that I couldn't.

220
00:22:29,124 --> 00:22:32,709
It's that I... I didn't want to.

221
00:22:36,548 --> 00:22:39,099
But this is what life looks like now.

222
00:22:42,054 --> 00:22:45,355
We have to see it.

223
00:22:45,357 --> 00:22:47,307
We have to fight it.

224
00:22:50,145 --> 00:22:54,231
If we don't fight, we die.

225
00:23:18,974 --> 00:23:20,974
I thought you said we weren't going over.

226
00:23:20,976 --> 00:23:23,226
We're not.

227
00:23:23,228 --> 00:23:25,011
We're going under.

228
00:23:27,516 --> 00:23:29,683
This leads to a sewer

229
00:23:29,685 --> 00:23:31,234
that was part of the old neighborhood

230
00:23:31,236 --> 00:23:34,571
that was here before they built this up.

231
00:23:34,573 --> 00:23:37,490
It'll take us under the wall...

232
00:23:39,077 --> 00:23:43,613
... and hopefully past the walkers.

233
00:23:43,615 --> 00:23:45,582
Thanks...

234
00:23:45,584 --> 00:23:48,368
but I'm going on my own from here.

235
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:51,621
- Maggie...
- No.

236
00:23:51,623 --> 00:23:53,373
Please.

237
00:23:55,627 --> 00:23:59,095
I can't... I can't watch
more names go up on that wall.

238
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:06,219
- If he's alive...
- If?

239
00:24:06,221 --> 00:24:07,804
He told Michonne he would've found

240
00:24:07,806 --> 00:24:10,140
some way to signal us if he got out.

241
00:24:10,142 --> 00:24:13,777
If he's alive or he's hurt
or trapped, maybe taken.

242
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,946
If he's alive, he needs my help.

243
00:24:16,948 --> 00:24:19,482
That's why I'm doing this.

244
00:24:19,484 --> 00:24:21,701
And if he's dead, I don't
want to be waiting on him.

245
00:24:24,323 --> 00:24:26,740
None of this is your fault.
You don't need to do this.

246
00:24:30,295 --> 00:24:32,662
People are dead.

247
00:24:32,664 --> 00:24:34,297
I was a part of that.

248
00:24:36,385 --> 00:24:38,168
And I have to live with that.

249
00:24:45,894 --> 00:24:49,429
I haven't been down
here since the beginning.

250
00:24:49,431 --> 00:24:51,481
Ah.

251
00:24:53,652 --> 00:24:55,318
Oh.

252
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,654
This ladder must've fallen a long time ago.

253
00:25:00,742 --> 00:25:02,359
Let's try and get it out of here.

254
00:25:02,361 --> 00:25:04,778
- Yeah.
- On three, ready?

255
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:07,197
One, two, three.

256
00:25:09,201 --> 00:25:11,868
One, two, three.

257
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,703
Aaron!

258
00:25:13,705 --> 00:25:15,588
Ah.

259
00:25:17,592 --> 00:25:20,043
I'm okay. The ladder caught me.

260
00:26:07,092 --> 00:26:09,092
You okay?

261
00:26:11,313 --> 00:26:12,929
Yeah.

262
00:26:12,931 --> 00:26:14,397
Thank you.

263
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:17,684
Aaron... your head.

264
00:26:21,106 --> 00:26:23,440
Come here.

265
00:26:23,442 --> 00:26:25,492
This could need stitches.
Aaron, just go back.

266
00:26:25,494 --> 00:26:27,193
- No.
- Yes.

267
00:26:27,195 --> 00:26:29,996
- I was just there for you.
- I could have done it.

268
00:26:31,366 --> 00:26:33,103
Just lead the way.

269
00:26:33,223 --> 00:26:34,636
Please?

270
00:26:52,624 --> 00:26:54,507
Hot damn.

271
00:27:19,818 --> 00:27:22,035
Hot damn.

272
00:27:24,456 --> 00:27:28,324
Daryl, Sasha, Abraham, you copy?

273
00:27:30,412 --> 00:27:32,829
Rick?

274
00:27:32,831 --> 00:27:34,881
Can I come up?

275
00:27:34,883 --> 00:27:36,382
Yeah.

276
00:27:46,344 --> 00:27:48,344
You haven't seen it.

277
00:27:48,346 --> 00:27:49,762
No.

278
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:53,983
Enid, she, uh...

279
00:27:57,072 --> 00:27:58,938
she used to sneak over the walls,

280
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,857
spend time out there.

281
00:28:02,527 --> 00:28:04,577
You know, I don't know
why. She just wanted to.

282
00:28:04,579 --> 00:28:06,663
But, um...

283
00:28:06,665 --> 00:28:08,531
I think she went out
there after the attack.

284
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:10,366
What, she's still out there?

285
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:12,785
Yeah.

286
00:28:12,787 --> 00:28:15,672
We don't know where she is.

287
00:28:15,674 --> 00:28:18,207
You know, but she knows
how to take care of herself.

288
00:28:20,178 --> 00:28:22,345
And we can't go out there.

289
00:28:22,347 --> 00:28:24,297
Carl wanted to try.

290
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:26,432
I stopped him. I told him
I'd tell you if he did.

291
00:28:26,434 --> 00:28:28,051
And then, um... I don't know.

292
00:28:28,053 --> 00:28:29,218
I just thought I should tell you...

293
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,887
Do you know where he is now?

294
00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:32,188
Yeah, he's back at the house.

295
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,723
I saw him on the porch with Judith.

296
00:28:35,727 --> 00:28:37,477
I can keep guard, if you want.

297
00:28:37,479 --> 00:28:40,647
Down there, they're guarding the place now.

298
00:28:40,649 --> 00:28:42,899
This is just about keeping
an eye out for the others

299
00:28:42,901 --> 00:28:47,153
that aren't back, looking
for a sign from Glenn.

300
00:28:47,155 --> 00:28:48,988
All right.

301
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:52,125
Thank you.

302
00:28:53,378 --> 00:28:55,578
Um...

303
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,997
so I was thinking about what
you said back at the quarry.

304
00:28:57,999 --> 00:29:00,833
And, uh, I mean, you're right.

305
00:29:00,835 --> 00:29:03,753
I need to know how to protect myself

306
00:29:03,755 --> 00:29:05,672
and my mom and brother.

307
00:29:07,475 --> 00:29:09,258
This place.

308
00:29:11,012 --> 00:29:13,429
So can you teach me how to shoot?

309
00:29:22,273 --> 00:29:24,440
There's your target.

310
00:29:30,081 --> 00:29:32,865
Just relax.

311
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:42,792
How is he?

312
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:59,475
Ahem.

313
00:29:59,477 --> 00:30:01,477
What is it?

314
00:30:03,281 --> 00:30:05,231
It's the end of the world.

315
00:30:06,985 --> 00:30:09,235
No, it's not.

316
00:30:11,956 --> 00:30:14,157
Yeah, being afraid sucks.

317
00:30:43,655 --> 00:30:47,023
We're still too close.

318
00:30:47,025 --> 00:30:49,358
We just have to get through a
few of them, then we're gone.

319
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,110
No.

320
00:30:51,112 --> 00:30:53,362
You ready?

321
00:30:53,364 --> 00:30:54,864
No, we can't.

322
00:30:57,452 --> 00:30:59,836
You can stay. I'll go.

323
00:30:59,838 --> 00:31:01,337
No.

324
00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:03,790
No!

325
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:06,092
- Maggie.
- It's over!

326
00:31:13,885 --> 00:31:16,886
I burned his last picture of him

327
00:31:16,888 --> 00:31:19,222
because I said I wasn't
gonna need it anymore.

328
00:31:19,224 --> 00:31:21,307
Because I was never gonna
be away from him again.

329
00:31:25,947 --> 00:31:27,613
I'm pregnant.

330
00:31:29,951 --> 00:31:32,902
He didn't want me to go
out there and I said yes.

331
00:31:32,904 --> 00:31:35,571
And if I would've gone...

332
00:31:35,573 --> 00:31:38,324
if I was with him, maybe
I could've helped him.

333
00:31:40,578 --> 00:31:42,411
I don't know if he's alive.

334
00:31:44,632 --> 00:31:48,050
He would've shown me by now.
That's what Michonne said.

335
00:31:51,339 --> 00:31:54,674
I just want to see his face.

336
00:31:54,676 --> 00:31:56,926
I can't.

337
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,513
I don't get to know what will happen.

338
00:32:00,515 --> 00:32:02,098
I won't get to know why it happened,

339
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,267
what I did right or wrong.

340
00:32:06,688 --> 00:32:08,571
Not now.

341
00:32:10,108 --> 00:32:13,159
I have to live with that. You do, too.

342
00:32:25,456 --> 00:32:29,175
Sam, I made you some cookies.

343
00:32:33,765 --> 00:32:35,798
Could you bring them up here, please?

344
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,767
No, Sam.

345
00:32:42,307 --> 00:32:44,724
Why?

346
00:32:44,726 --> 00:32:47,610
Why don't you wanna come downstairs?

347
00:32:47,612 --> 00:32:49,896
I just don't wanna go down there.

348
00:32:51,649 --> 00:32:53,366
Why?

349
00:32:54,736 --> 00:32:56,819
I just...

350
00:33:01,326 --> 00:33:03,910
it didn't change up here.

351
00:33:08,883 --> 00:33:13,386
Well, I'm more than halfway up,

352
00:33:13,388 --> 00:33:16,556
so technically I'm upstairs.

353
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:19,342
You can come here and
you won't be downstairs.

354
00:33:23,231 --> 00:33:25,598
No, it's okay, then.

355
00:33:57,548 --> 00:34:00,716
I'm going to talk that way
because that's how it is!

356
00:34:00,718 --> 00:34:02,602
It is now, I know, but you can't...

357
00:34:02,604 --> 00:34:04,437
It was a lie.

358
00:34:04,439 --> 00:34:07,723
The fact that we're alive... it's a joke.

359
00:34:07,725 --> 00:34:10,726
All this...

360
00:34:25,627 --> 00:34:27,960
Come on, you son of a bitch.

361
00:34:54,656 --> 00:34:57,106
Carol said she got one of them,

362
00:34:57,108 --> 00:34:59,442
but she couldn't find the body.

363
00:34:59,444 --> 00:35:01,827
He must have been under there.

364
00:35:14,542 --> 00:35:16,509
I want to live.

365
00:35:18,596 --> 00:35:22,848
I want this place to stay standing.

366
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:24,884
You need to lead them.

367
00:35:26,637 --> 00:35:28,270
They don't need me, Rick.

368
00:35:30,808 --> 00:35:33,693
What they need is you.

369
00:35:59,694 --> 00:36:02,417
What I wanted for this place,

370
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:06,848
was it really just pie in the sky?

371
00:36:11,349 --> 00:36:12,581
No.

372
00:37:03,197 --> 00:37:04,914
I'll be right back.

373
00:37:41,903 --> 00:37:45,454
When he gets back, it's worth mentioning

374
00:37:45,456 --> 00:37:49,408
that Aaron, Erin,

375
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:52,828
works for a boy or a girl,

376
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:54,830
depending on the spelling.

377
00:37:58,302 --> 00:37:59,752
Just saying.

378
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:22,024
What?

379
00:38:22,026 --> 00:38:24,076
I'm your relief.

380
00:38:24,078 --> 00:38:26,328
I thought Carol was up.

381
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:29,999
She was. I volunteered to take her place.

382
00:38:43,714 --> 00:38:46,265
You know, I never got a
chance to say it, but...

383
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,637
you did good with the truck,

384
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:54,440
taking out the driver.

385
00:38:54,442 --> 00:38:56,642
You know, if it weren't for you,

386
00:38:56,644 --> 00:38:58,777
this wall might not be standing right now.

387
00:39:00,948 --> 00:39:02,398
I just got lucky.

388
00:39:03,651 --> 00:39:05,868
Good or lucky, it doesn't really matter.

389
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,820
Just keep doing what you're doing.

390
00:39:49,747 --> 00:39:53,082
Those bodies by the graveyard...

391
00:39:53,084 --> 00:39:55,918
the reason I wanted to wait was...

392
00:40:00,091 --> 00:40:01,874
was Glenn.

393
00:40:04,045 --> 00:40:06,128
We don't know if he's still out there.

394
00:40:07,682 --> 00:40:11,633
And Daryl, Sasha, Abraham.

395
00:40:11,635 --> 00:40:13,719
I wanted them back by now.

396
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,557
I wanted those things gone.

397
00:40:21,645 --> 00:40:23,529
I just wanted to wait.

398
00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:30,903
You said it could go on a while.

399
00:40:30,905 --> 00:40:34,740
I did and it could.

400
00:40:34,742 --> 00:40:36,992
Rick, it already has.

401
00:40:38,746 --> 00:40:40,879
They could still be alive.

402
00:40:40,881 --> 00:40:43,215
We're not moving past that.

403
00:40:43,217 --> 00:40:45,000
You know, it's just...

404
00:40:47,088 --> 00:40:48,921
right here, in this moment...

405
00:40:51,058 --> 00:40:53,308
this is it, this is what it is.

406
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:55,761
"This is what life looks like now."

407
00:40:58,983 --> 00:41:00,232
You heard about that?

408
00:41:05,689 --> 00:41:08,273
I wasn't saying there wasn't a future.

409
00:41:10,661 --> 00:41:12,027
There's gotta be.

410
00:41:20,621 --> 00:41:22,371
Tell me there's more.

411
00:42:41,161 --> 00:42:51,319
