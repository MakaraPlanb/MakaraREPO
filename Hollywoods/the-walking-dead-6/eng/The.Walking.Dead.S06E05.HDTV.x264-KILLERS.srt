1
00:00:00,587 --> 00:00:03,254
Previously on AMC's The Walking Dead...

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,722
There's a horn or something!

3
00:00:05,357 --> 00:00:06,490
Half of them broke off.

4
00:00:06,575 --> 00:00:07,855
They're going towards Alexandria.

5
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:08,910
You keep going!

6
00:00:09,027 --> 00:00:10,207
I'll get the RV.

7
00:00:10,327 --> 00:00:11,912
I'll get in front of them
before they get there.

8
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:12,913
I can lead them away again.

9
00:00:13,031 --> 00:00:14,531
You just get home.

10
00:00:17,419 --> 00:00:18,452
Come inside.

11
00:00:18,537 --> 00:00:20,403
I can keep you safe.

12
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:24,207
Up here!

13
00:00:24,343 --> 00:00:25,375
Nicholas, don't!

14
00:00:25,511 --> 00:00:26,543
Look at me!

15
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:24,668
The town was overrun.

16
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,137
He split off with Nicholas.

17
00:01:27,139 --> 00:01:30,557
He had this idea that...

18
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:34,311
If he lit a fire, it would stop
the walkers from coming here.

19
00:01:35,347 --> 00:01:37,981
I tried to go instead.

20
00:01:37,983 --> 00:01:40,517
I wanted to.

21
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:42,485
The fire never got lit.

22
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:46,690
We had to keep going.

23
00:01:47,826 --> 00:01:49,776
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:54,281
He said if he got stuck,

25
00:01:54,283 --> 00:01:56,249
he would find a way to send us a signal.

26
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:57,667
A signal?

27
00:01:57,669 --> 00:01:59,619
Open the gate!

28
00:02:05,177 --> 00:02:06,676
Open the gate!

29
00:02:25,697 --> 00:02:29,899
Open the gate now!

30
00:03:32,168 --> 00:03:40,168

31
00:04:13,283 --> 00:04:14,783
You can hear it.

32
00:04:16,253 --> 00:04:18,954
Some of you saw it.

33
00:04:18,956 --> 00:04:22,791
They got back here, half of them.

34
00:04:22,793 --> 00:04:25,877
Still enough to surround us 20 deep.

35
00:04:29,049 --> 00:04:31,079
Look, I know you're scared.

36
00:04:31,823 --> 00:04:34,824
You haven't seen anything like this.

37
00:04:34,826 --> 00:04:38,044
You haven't been through
anything like this.

38
00:04:38,046 --> 00:04:40,830
But we're safe for now.

39
00:04:43,502 --> 00:04:47,003
The panel the truck hit seems intact.

40
00:04:47,005 --> 00:04:48,922
We reinforced it just in case.

41
00:04:48,924 --> 00:04:52,175
Either way, the wall's gonna hold together.

42
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,180
Can you?

43
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,684
The others, they're gonna be back.

44
00:05:01,686 --> 00:05:03,353
They're gonna be back.

45
00:05:06,825 --> 00:05:12,362
Daryl, Abraham, Sasha, they have vehicles.

46
00:05:12,364 --> 00:05:15,448
They're gonna lead 'em
away, just like the others.

47
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,868
And Glenn and Nicholas are gonna walk
back through the front gate after.

48
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,870
They know what they're doing,

49
00:05:20,872 --> 00:05:24,207
and we know what we need to do.

50
00:05:25,377 --> 00:05:27,760
We keep noise to a minimum.

51
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:29,429
Pull our blinds at night.

52
00:05:29,431 --> 00:05:32,715
Even better, keep the lights out.

53
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,722
We'll try to make this place as quiet
as a graveyard, see if they move on.

54
00:05:39,724 --> 00:05:41,941
This place is a graveyard.

55
00:05:51,536 --> 00:05:54,370
The quarry broke open

56
00:05:54,372 --> 00:05:57,290
and those walkers were heading this way.

57
00:05:57,292 --> 00:05:59,909
All of them.

58
00:06:01,913 --> 00:06:04,914
The plan that Rick put into place

59
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,300
stopped that from happening.

60
00:06:07,302 --> 00:06:09,636
He got half of them away.

61
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:17,260
I was out there recruiting with Daryl.

62
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:23,099
I wanted to try to get
into a cannery and scavenge,

63
00:06:23,101 --> 00:06:26,653
and Daryl wanted to
keep looking for people.

64
00:06:28,106 --> 00:06:29,856
We did what I wanted...

65
00:06:31,943 --> 00:06:34,611
and we wound up in a
trap set by those people.

66
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:36,996
And I lost my pack.

67
00:06:36,998 --> 00:06:39,866
They must've followed our tracks.

68
00:06:39,868 --> 00:06:42,001
Those people who attacked us...

69
00:06:45,674 --> 00:06:47,957
they found their way
back here because of me.

70
00:07:02,774 --> 00:07:04,807
There'll be more to talk about.

71
00:07:07,612 --> 00:07:09,145
Deanna?

72
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:16,069
Deanna?

73
00:08:27,776 --> 00:08:29,475
Don't.

74
00:08:34,983 --> 00:08:37,450
We don't bury killers inside the walls.

75
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,491
We aren't going out there.

76
00:08:45,493 --> 00:08:46,993
So what do we do?

77
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:52,248
We wait.

78
00:08:57,088 --> 00:08:59,055
I can't even make two meals out of this.

79
00:08:59,057 --> 00:09:02,475
The soups and sauces can be
stretched out with some extra water.

80
00:09:02,477 --> 00:09:06,145
What difference does that
make if we'll be dead tomorrow?

81
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:10,099
- We have to ration now...
- I can't.

82
00:09:10,101 --> 00:09:14,654
I can't spend whatever time I have
left watching my family starve.

83
00:09:14,656 --> 00:09:16,522
- Wait.
- I'm sorry.

84
00:09:19,444 --> 00:09:22,078
Sorry, Olivia. I just don't see the point.

85
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:29,786
Hey. Hey!

86
00:09:29,788 --> 00:09:31,370
Stop.

87
00:09:31,372 --> 00:09:33,539
Right now, stop it.

88
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,875
This stuff is for everyone.

89
00:09:35,877 --> 00:09:38,211
We need to make it last
if we're gonna survive.

90
00:09:38,213 --> 00:09:41,180
Why don't you go make sure
the gate's closed, Spencer?

91
00:09:41,182 --> 00:09:43,966
Yeah. That was me.

92
00:09:43,968 --> 00:09:45,435
I did that.

93
00:09:47,188 --> 00:09:50,973
But that truck outside the walls,

94
00:09:50,975 --> 00:09:54,143
it'd be inside if it wasn't for me.

95
00:09:54,145 --> 00:09:56,479
I did that, too.

96
00:09:56,481 --> 00:10:00,650
If I didn't, maybe we
wouldn't be talking right now.

97
00:10:02,654 --> 00:10:04,487
Where were you, Bruce?

98
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,711
Doing this will start us down
a road where nothing matters.

99
00:10:12,881 --> 00:10:15,298
Where no one else matters.

100
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:20,670
And then we'll all look
back at this moment right now

101
00:10:20,672 --> 00:10:22,889
as when we destroyed this place.

102
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:07,032
You're going out?

103
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,657
The flashlights, the rebar, the rope.

104
00:12:17,461 --> 00:12:20,212
You lower them off the
wall a good distance apart,

105
00:12:20,214 --> 00:12:22,164
maybe spin them.

106
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:25,217
That way, the walkers are drawn to each one

107
00:12:25,219 --> 00:12:27,135
and you open up a path.

108
00:12:32,926 --> 00:12:34,509
Now you're gearing up.

109
00:12:36,397 --> 00:12:38,513
Just waiting for dark, right?

110
00:12:42,352 --> 00:12:47,072
What happens when you
twist an ankle jumping down?

111
00:12:48,192 --> 00:12:50,275
Hmm?

112
00:12:50,277 --> 00:12:52,527
Or you just get slowed down by one of them

113
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:54,362
and then you have to deal with all of them?

114
00:12:57,618 --> 00:12:59,251
I can't let you do this.

115
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:03,371
You can't stop me.

116
00:13:08,011 --> 00:13:09,761
I'm going to help you.

117
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,386
And I know a safer way out.

118
00:14:30,794 --> 00:14:33,295
- Spencer?
- Yeah.

119
00:14:33,297 --> 00:14:35,764
I...

120
00:14:35,766 --> 00:14:37,265
My bad.

121
00:14:40,187 --> 00:14:42,220
Are you drunk?

122
00:14:42,222 --> 00:14:43,722
Getting there.

123
00:14:50,981 --> 00:14:52,981
This came from the pantry.

124
00:14:57,738 --> 00:14:59,955
You... you stole it?

125
00:14:59,957 --> 00:15:01,573
I wouldn't call it that.

126
00:15:06,997 --> 00:15:08,914
So what you told everyone...

127
00:15:12,302 --> 00:15:13,802
that was just bullshit?

128
00:15:13,804 --> 00:15:17,138
No. If they all went
in and raided the pantry

129
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,642
and everyone knew it, saw it,

130
00:15:20,644 --> 00:15:22,811
then that would be the end.

131
00:15:22,813 --> 00:15:25,513
But one person?

132
00:15:25,515 --> 00:15:28,683
One person, and no one ever would know.

133
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:34,022
So, why not me?

134
00:15:34,024 --> 00:15:35,907
I stopped that little run at the bank.

135
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:37,409
I deserve a reward.

136
00:15:37,411 --> 00:15:40,862
One last celebration.

137
00:15:40,864 --> 00:15:43,915
Because they were right, Mom,

138
00:15:43,917 --> 00:15:47,002
and you know it.

139
00:15:47,004 --> 00:15:49,204
We're all gonna be dead real soon.

140
00:15:49,206 --> 00:15:50,705
Damn it, Spencer!

141
00:15:50,707 --> 00:15:51,923
Me?

142
00:15:51,925 --> 00:15:53,875
Now that is some bullshit!

143
00:15:53,877 --> 00:15:56,044
You're the reason we're so screwed.

144
00:15:56,046 --> 00:15:57,679
You made us this way.

145
00:15:57,681 --> 00:15:59,547
We were never safe here.

146
00:15:59,549 --> 00:16:01,049
But you didn't want to see that.

147
00:16:01,051 --> 00:16:02,350
You didn't want us to see that.

148
00:16:02,352 --> 00:16:04,686
You just wanted to dream.

149
00:16:04,688 --> 00:16:08,690
What happened to Dad, to Aiden,

150
00:16:08,692 --> 00:16:10,108
that's all you.

151
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:53,101
Hey.

152
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:56,938
You okay?

153
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,857
Why wouldn't I be?

154
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:04,529
Have you seen Enid?

155
00:17:04,531 --> 00:17:07,832
Not since I saw her with you.

156
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:10,251
I think she went over the
wall just before the herd came

157
00:17:10,253 --> 00:17:12,704
and now she's trapped out there.

158
00:17:12,706 --> 00:17:14,456
What makes you think she isn't dead?

159
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:15,707
Come on, man.

160
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,300
Look...

161
00:17:25,302 --> 00:17:26,801
I'll go find her.

162
00:17:26,803 --> 00:17:28,603
I just need your help.

163
00:17:28,605 --> 00:17:30,805
- If you maybe climb up...
- I'm not helping you, Carl.

164
00:17:31,975 --> 00:17:34,859
This isn't for me.

165
00:17:34,861 --> 00:17:36,861
It's for Enid.

166
00:17:36,863 --> 00:17:39,698
- Your friend.
- My girlfriend.

167
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,566
Or, I mean, 'cause she was anyway, right?

168
00:17:41,568 --> 00:17:42,867
So you want to just leave her out there?

169
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:44,486
I told her to stop going over the wall,

170
00:17:44,488 --> 00:17:46,237
I told her there's bad people out there

171
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,989
and that it's stupid and dangerous.

172
00:17:47,991 --> 00:17:49,708
Not if you know what you're doing.

173
00:17:52,829 --> 00:17:55,580
Well, I'm not gonna let you go.

174
00:17:55,582 --> 00:17:57,582
Carl.

175
00:17:57,584 --> 00:17:59,384
Carl, you're not going out there.

176
00:17:59,386 --> 00:18:01,302
Back off.

177
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:05,173
All right.

178
00:18:11,181 --> 00:18:13,348
I'll tell your dad.

179
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,684
He'll go out there to find you,
then other people will, too.

180
00:18:16,686 --> 00:18:19,020
And then somebody's gonna die.

181
00:18:20,991 --> 00:18:23,024
Huh?

182
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:27,779
You saved my life and now I'm saving yours.

183
00:19:06,287 --> 00:19:08,237
Sorry.

184
00:19:09,407 --> 00:19:10,823
Got away from me.

185
00:19:10,825 --> 00:19:12,426
You're still here.

186
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:15,744
Don't.

187
00:19:15,746 --> 00:19:17,913
'Kay.

188
00:19:17,915 --> 00:19:19,555
Won't tell you you're being brave, either.

189
00:19:23,754 --> 00:19:27,673
He hasn't woken up. His wound's infected.

190
00:19:27,675 --> 00:19:29,675
I don't know what the hell to do,

191
00:19:29,677 --> 00:19:33,095
so it doesn't really matter what I'm being.

192
00:19:33,097 --> 00:19:35,097
Yeah, but you're still here.

193
00:19:37,017 --> 00:19:38,851
Why are you here?

194
00:19:38,853 --> 00:19:40,269
My head hurts.

195
00:19:43,357 --> 00:19:45,324
On a scale of one to 10, how bad?

196
00:19:45,326 --> 00:19:47,276
I'm lying.

197
00:19:47,278 --> 00:19:49,995
I'm just checking on you.

198
00:19:49,997 --> 00:19:52,080
Well...

199
00:19:54,952 --> 00:19:56,201
here I am.

200
00:19:56,203 --> 00:19:59,671
Clueless on the floor.

201
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,509
You patched people up.

202
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:06,545
You're helping make things better.

203
00:20:06,547 --> 00:20:09,465
I think he's gonna die.

204
00:20:09,467 --> 00:20:13,101
And I'm so scared about
what's happening in here

205
00:20:13,103 --> 00:20:16,638
that I can't think about
what's happening out there.

206
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,974
And that's actually good.

207
00:20:18,976 --> 00:20:21,977
And I don't know what to do with that.

208
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:25,197
I just want him to live and
for the roamers to go away.

209
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:27,783
And for a doctor to show up at the gates

210
00:20:27,785 --> 00:20:29,485
so I can go back to my apartment

211
00:20:29,487 --> 00:20:31,820
and keep reading "War and Peace."

212
00:20:33,657 --> 00:20:36,542
But here comes the end of the world.

213
00:20:37,661 --> 00:20:39,995
He's not dead yet.

214
00:20:39,997 --> 00:20:42,331
I don't know about that.

215
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,637
It's not like I don't feel it.

216
00:20:51,175 --> 00:20:53,258
You know, being afraid sucks.

217
00:22:17,761 --> 00:22:20,262
I used to not want to see...

218
00:22:21,398 --> 00:22:23,348
the way things are.

219
00:22:26,604 --> 00:22:28,770
It's not that I couldn't.

220
00:22:30,524 --> 00:22:34,109
It's that I... I didn't want to.

221
00:22:37,948 --> 00:22:40,499
But this is what life looks like now.

222
00:22:43,454 --> 00:22:46,755
We have to see it.

223
00:22:46,757 --> 00:22:48,707
We have to fight it.

224
00:22:51,545 --> 00:22:55,631
If we don't fight, we die.

225
00:23:20,374 --> 00:23:22,374
I thought you said we weren't going over.

226
00:23:22,376 --> 00:23:24,626
We're not.

227
00:23:24,628 --> 00:23:26,411
We're going under.

228
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:31,083
This leads to a sewer

229
00:23:31,085 --> 00:23:32,634
that was part of the old neighborhood

230
00:23:32,636 --> 00:23:35,971
that was here before they built this up.

231
00:23:35,973 --> 00:23:38,890
It'll take us under the wall...

232
00:23:40,477 --> 00:23:45,013
... and hopefully past the walkers.

233
00:23:45,015 --> 00:23:46,982
Thanks...

234
00:23:46,984 --> 00:23:49,768
but I'm going on my own from here.

235
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:53,021
- Maggie...
- No.

236
00:23:53,023 --> 00:23:54,773
Please.

237
00:23:57,027 --> 00:24:00,495
I can't... I can't watch
more names go up on that wall.

238
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:07,619
- If he's alive...
- If?

239
00:24:07,621 --> 00:24:09,204
He told Michonne he would've found

240
00:24:09,206 --> 00:24:11,540
some way to signal us if he got out.

241
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:15,177
If he's alive or he's hurt
or trapped, maybe taken.

242
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,346
If he's alive, he needs my help.

243
00:24:18,348 --> 00:24:20,882
That's why I'm doing this.

244
00:24:20,884 --> 00:24:23,101
And if he's dead, I don't
want to be waiting on him.

245
00:24:25,723 --> 00:24:28,140
None of this is your fault.
You don't need to do this.

246
00:24:31,695 --> 00:24:34,062
People are dead.

247
00:24:34,064 --> 00:24:35,697
I was a part of that.

248
00:24:37,785 --> 00:24:39,568
And I have to live with that.

249
00:24:47,294 --> 00:24:50,829
I haven't been down
here since the beginning.

250
00:24:50,831 --> 00:24:52,881
Ah.

251
00:24:55,052 --> 00:24:56,718
Oh.

252
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,054
This ladder must've fallen a long time ago.

253
00:25:02,142 --> 00:25:03,759
Let's try and get it out of here.

254
00:25:03,761 --> 00:25:06,178
- Yeah.
- On three, ready?

255
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,597
One, two, three.

256
00:25:10,601 --> 00:25:13,268
One, two, three.

257
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,103
Aaron!

258
00:25:15,105 --> 00:25:16,988
Ah.

259
00:25:18,992 --> 00:25:21,443
I'm okay. The ladder caught me.

260
00:26:08,492 --> 00:26:10,492
You okay?

261
00:26:12,713 --> 00:26:14,329
Yeah.

262
00:26:14,331 --> 00:26:15,797
Thank you.

263
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:19,084
Aaron... your head.

264
00:26:22,506 --> 00:26:24,840
Come here.

265
00:26:24,842 --> 00:26:26,892
This could need stitches.
Aaron, just go back.

266
00:26:26,894 --> 00:26:28,593
- No.
- Yes.

267
00:26:28,595 --> 00:26:31,396
- I was just there for you.
- I could have done it.

268
00:26:32,766 --> 00:26:34,503
Just lead the way.

269
00:26:34,623 --> 00:26:36,036
Please?

270
00:26:54,424 --> 00:26:56,307
Hot damn.

271
00:27:21,618 --> 00:27:23,835
Hot damn.

272
00:27:26,256 --> 00:27:30,124
Daryl, Sasha, Abraham, you copy?

273
00:27:32,212 --> 00:27:34,629
Rick?

274
00:27:34,631 --> 00:27:36,681
Can I come up?

275
00:27:36,683 --> 00:27:38,182
Yeah.

276
00:27:48,144 --> 00:27:50,144
You haven't seen it.

277
00:27:50,146 --> 00:27:51,562
No.

278
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,783
Enid, she, uh...

279
00:27:58,872 --> 00:28:00,738
she used to sneak over the walls,

280
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,657
spend time out there.

281
00:28:04,327 --> 00:28:06,377
You know, I don't know
why. She just wanted to.

282
00:28:06,379 --> 00:28:08,463
But, um...

283
00:28:08,465 --> 00:28:10,331
I think she went out
there after the attack.

284
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:12,166
What, she's still out there?

285
00:28:12,168 --> 00:28:14,585
Yeah.

286
00:28:14,587 --> 00:28:17,472
We don't know where she is.

287
00:28:17,474 --> 00:28:20,007
You know, but she knows
how to take care of herself.

288
00:28:21,978 --> 00:28:24,145
And we can't go out there.

289
00:28:24,147 --> 00:28:26,097
Carl wanted to try.

290
00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:28,232
I stopped him. I told him
I'd tell you if he did.

291
00:28:28,234 --> 00:28:29,851
And then, um... I don't know.

292
00:28:29,853 --> 00:28:31,018
I just thought I should tell you...

293
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,687
Do you know where he is now?

294
00:28:32,689 --> 00:28:33,988
Yeah, he's back at the house.

295
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,523
I saw him on the porch with Judith.

296
00:28:37,527 --> 00:28:39,277
I can keep guard, if you want.

297
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,447
Down there, they're guarding the place now.

298
00:28:42,449 --> 00:28:44,699
This is just about keeping
an eye out for the others

299
00:28:44,701 --> 00:28:48,953
that aren't back, looking
for a sign from Glenn.

300
00:28:48,955 --> 00:28:50,788
All right.

301
00:28:52,459 --> 00:28:53,925
Thank you.

302
00:28:55,178 --> 00:28:57,378
Um...

303
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,797
so I was thinking about what
you said back at the quarry.

304
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:02,633
And, uh, I mean, you're right.

305
00:29:02,635 --> 00:29:05,553
I need to know how to protect myself

306
00:29:05,555 --> 00:29:07,472
and my mom and brother.

307
00:29:09,275 --> 00:29:11,058
This place.

308
00:29:12,812 --> 00:29:15,229
So can you teach me how to shoot?

309
00:29:24,073 --> 00:29:26,240
There's your target.

310
00:29:31,881 --> 00:29:34,665
Just relax.

311
00:29:42,425 --> 00:29:44,592
How is he?

312
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:01,275
Ahem.

313
00:30:01,277 --> 00:30:03,277
What is it?

314
00:30:05,081 --> 00:30:07,031
It's the end of the world.

315
00:30:08,785 --> 00:30:11,035
No, it's not.

316
00:30:13,756 --> 00:30:15,957
Yeah, being afraid sucks.

317
00:30:45,455 --> 00:30:48,823
We're still too close.

318
00:30:48,825 --> 00:30:51,158
We just have to get through a
few of them, then we're gone.

319
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,910
No.

320
00:30:52,912 --> 00:30:55,162
You ready?

321
00:30:55,164 --> 00:30:56,664
No, we can't.

322
00:30:59,252 --> 00:31:01,636
You can stay. I'll go.

323
00:31:01,638 --> 00:31:03,137
No.

324
00:31:03,139 --> 00:31:05,590
No!

325
00:31:05,592 --> 00:31:07,892
- Maggie.
- It's over!

326
00:31:15,685 --> 00:31:18,686
I burned his last picture of him

327
00:31:18,688 --> 00:31:21,022
because I said I wasn't
gonna need it anymore.

328
00:31:21,024 --> 00:31:23,107
Because I was never gonna
be away from him again.

329
00:31:27,747 --> 00:31:29,413
I'm pregnant.

330
00:31:31,751 --> 00:31:34,702
He didn't want me to go
out there and I said yes.

331
00:31:34,704 --> 00:31:37,371
And if I would've gone...

332
00:31:37,373 --> 00:31:40,124
if I was with him, maybe
I could've helped him.

333
00:31:42,378 --> 00:31:44,211
I don't know if he's alive.

334
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:49,850
He would've shown me by now.
That's what Michonne said.

335
00:31:53,139 --> 00:31:56,474
I just want to see his face.

336
00:31:56,476 --> 00:31:58,726
I can't.

337
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,313
I don't get to know what will happen.

338
00:32:02,315 --> 00:32:03,898
I won't get to know why it happened,

339
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,067
what I did right or wrong.

340
00:32:08,488 --> 00:32:10,371
Not now.

341
00:32:11,908 --> 00:32:14,959
I have to live with that. You do, too.

342
00:32:27,256 --> 00:32:30,975
Sam, I made you some cookies.

343
00:32:35,565 --> 00:32:37,598
Could you bring them up here, please?

344
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,567
No, Sam.

345
00:32:44,107 --> 00:32:46,524
Why?

346
00:32:46,526 --> 00:32:49,410
Why don't you wanna come downstairs?

347
00:32:49,412 --> 00:32:51,696
I just don't wanna go down there.

348
00:32:53,449 --> 00:32:55,166
Why?

349
00:32:56,536 --> 00:32:58,619
I just...

350
00:33:03,126 --> 00:33:05,710
it didn't change up here.

351
00:33:10,683 --> 00:33:15,186
Well, I'm more than halfway up,

352
00:33:15,188 --> 00:33:18,356
so technically I'm upstairs.

353
00:33:18,358 --> 00:33:21,142
You can come here and
you won't be downstairs.

354
00:33:25,031 --> 00:33:27,398
No, it's okay, then.

355
00:33:59,348 --> 00:34:02,516
I'm going to talk that way
because that's how it is!

356
00:34:02,518 --> 00:34:04,402
It is now, I know, but you can't...

357
00:34:04,404 --> 00:34:06,237
It was a lie.

358
00:34:06,239 --> 00:34:09,523
The fact that we're alive... it's a joke.

359
00:34:09,525 --> 00:34:12,526
All this...

360
00:34:27,427 --> 00:34:29,760
Come on, you son of a bitch.

361
00:34:56,456 --> 00:34:58,906
Carol said she got one of them,

362
00:34:58,908 --> 00:35:01,242
but she couldn't find the body.

363
00:35:01,244 --> 00:35:03,627
He must have been under there.

364
00:35:16,342 --> 00:35:18,309
I want to live.

365
00:35:20,396 --> 00:35:24,648
I want this place to stay standing.

366
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,684
You need to lead them.

367
00:35:28,437 --> 00:35:30,070
They don't need me, Rick.

368
00:35:32,608 --> 00:35:35,493
What they need is you.

369
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,194
What I wanted for this place,

370
00:36:05,595 --> 00:36:08,326
was it really just pie in the sky?

371
00:36:13,127 --> 00:36:14,067
No.

372
00:37:05,597 --> 00:37:07,314
I'll be right back.

373
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:47,854
When he gets back, it's worth mentioning

374
00:37:47,856 --> 00:37:51,808
that Aaron, Erin,

375
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:55,228
works for a boy or a girl,

376
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,230
depending on the spelling.

377
00:38:00,702 --> 00:38:02,152
Just saying.

378
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:24,424
What?

379
00:38:24,426 --> 00:38:26,476
I'm your relief.

380
00:38:26,478 --> 00:38:28,728
I thought Carol was up.

381
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:32,399
She was. I volunteered to take her place.

382
00:38:46,114 --> 00:38:48,665
You know, I never got a
chance to say it, but...

383
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:54,037
you did good with the truck,

384
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:56,840
taking out the driver.

385
00:38:56,842 --> 00:38:59,042
You know, if it weren't for you,

386
00:38:59,044 --> 00:39:01,177
this wall might not be standing right now.

387
00:39:03,348 --> 00:39:04,798
I just got lucky.

388
00:39:06,051 --> 00:39:08,268
Good or lucky, it doesn't really matter.

389
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:10,220
Just keep doing what you're doing.

390
00:39:52,147 --> 00:39:55,482
Those bodies by the graveyard...

391
00:39:55,484 --> 00:39:58,318
the reason I wanted to wait was...

392
00:40:02,491 --> 00:40:04,274
was Glenn.

393
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,528
We don't know if he's still out there.

394
00:40:10,082 --> 00:40:14,033
And Daryl, Sasha, Abraham.

395
00:40:14,035 --> 00:40:16,119
I wanted them back by now.

396
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,957
I wanted those things gone.

397
00:40:24,045 --> 00:40:25,929
I just wanted to wait.

398
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:33,303
You said it could go on a while.

399
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:37,140
I did and it could.

400
00:40:37,142 --> 00:40:39,392
Rick, it already has.

401
00:40:41,146 --> 00:40:43,279
They could still be alive.

402
00:40:43,281 --> 00:40:45,615
We're not moving past that.

403
00:40:45,617 --> 00:40:47,400
You know, it's just...

404
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,321
right here, in this moment...

405
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:55,708
this is it, this is what it is.

406
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:58,161
"This is what life looks like now."

407
00:41:01,383 --> 00:41:02,632
You heard about that?

408
00:41:08,089 --> 00:41:10,673
I wasn't saying there wasn't a future.

409
00:41:13,061 --> 00:41:14,427
There's gotta be.

410
00:41:23,021 --> 00:41:24,771
Tell me there's more.

411
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:51,561
