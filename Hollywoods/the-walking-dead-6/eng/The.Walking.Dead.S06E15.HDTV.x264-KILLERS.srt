<i>"Previously on
AMC's "The Walking Dead..."</i>

00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,115
Those people you met, the
ones in the burnt forest,

3
00:00:06,216 --> 00:00:07,883
you saved them, right?

4
00:00:07,984 --> 00:00:09,104
<i>You should have killed them.</i>

5
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:14,456
<i>You're going to let us into
your little complex,</i>

6
00:00:14,557 --> 00:00:17,876
and then you're gonna let us take
whatever and whoever we want.

7
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:20,629
Fall back!

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,810
<i>I wish it didn't
have to end, not this way,</i>

9
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:24,900
<i>but it's how it has to be.</i>

10
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:27,069
<i>So I'm going like I
always should have.</i>

11
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,064
<i>Don't come after me, please.</i>

12
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:34,510
<i>I can see you.</i>

13
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:38,013
<i>Come out.</i>

14
00:00:38,015 --> 00:00:39,414
<i>Slowly.</i>

15
00:00:42,253 --> 00:00:44,686
<i>Yeah, I think I'm gonna pass on that.</i>

<i>You here?</i>

19
00:02:30,713 --> 00:02:32,981
Upstairs.

20
00:02:37,153 --> 00:02:38,386
How are you?

21
00:02:38,388 --> 00:02:40,455
Happy to see you.

22
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,593
What happened?

23
00:02:44,595 --> 00:02:46,828
Oh, I just slipped.

24
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,497
Building a new guard tower.

25
00:02:49,499 --> 00:02:52,100
<i>I went to the infirmary.</i>

26
00:02:52,102 --> 00:02:54,436
<i>It's so quiet over there now.</i>

27
00:02:55,538 --> 00:02:59,341
I knew Denise since the beginning.

28
00:02:59,343 --> 00:03:03,878
<i>She wasn't around much
before Pete, but...</i>

29
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,382
<i>before that, she just stayed inside.</i>

30
00:03:07,384 --> 00:03:11,286
<i>She was
always-- was always reading something.</i>

31
00:03:11,288 --> 00:03:14,322
<i>And she really stepped up
when she had to.</i>

32
00:03:14,324 --> 00:03:16,124
<i>She was there for us.</i>

33
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:30,605
I didn't mean to bring it up.

34
00:03:30,607 --> 00:03:34,109
No, it's just--

35
00:03:34,111 --> 00:03:37,712
I just keep thinking about
Tara, when she finds out.

36
00:03:37,714 --> 00:03:39,247
<i>Ah.</i>

37
00:03:39,249 --> 00:03:43,151

This is good.

00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,925
Mm, it is.

89
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:47,629
Jesus came through.

90
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:50,231
They all did.

91
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:52,734
And they're all
gonna keep coming through.

92
00:07:52,736 --> 00:07:56,871
Maggie asked me and Glenn to help
put up more bins and watch points.

93
00:08:01,477 --> 00:08:04,579
S-stick around.

94
00:08:04,581 --> 00:08:07,315
Judith-- Judith
isn't even up yet.

95
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,487
Wait, no.
No, no, no, no.

96
00:08:12,489 --> 00:08:15,223
- Yeah? Why not?
- No.

97
00:08:15,225 --> 00:08:17,592
Maggie has us on a schedule

98
00:08:17,594 --> 00:08:21,262
and I'm not pissing off
a pregnant lady.

99
00:08:23,065 --> 00:08:24,566
Yeah.

100
00:08:24,568 --> 00:08:28,036
- Not that pregnant lady.
- Right.

101
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:31,706
Go.

102
00:08:37,746 --> 00:08:39,981
She's worried about an attack.

103
00:08:42,184 --> 00:08:45,587
When they come for us, we'll end it,

104
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:47,589
the whole thing.

105
00:08:47,591 --> 00:08:51,025
This won't be like before.

106
00:08:51,027 --> 00:08:52,560
We're putting everything in place

107
00:08:52,562 --> 00:08:54,395
and these people know what to do now.

108
00:08:57,232 --> 00:08:59,767
The world's ours,

109
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:01,903
and we know how to take it.

110
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,111
Everything we need

111
00:09:10,113 --> 00:09:13,581
is right here inside these walls.

112
00:09:15,217 --> 00:09:18,252
We're not losing any of it again.

113
00:09:18,254 --> 00:09:19,520
I'm not.

114
00:09:19,522 --> 00:09:22,190
No, you're not.

115
00:09:28,864 --> 00:09:30,932
I'm not.

116
00:09:39,842 --> 00:09:42,310
We'll have these,
but we should hide a few.

117
00:09:42,312 --> 00:09:45,046
That way, we can find them,
but strangers can't.

118
00:09:45,048 --> 00:09:46,881
In case anyone gets in.

119
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,018
They won't.

120
00:09:52,155 --> 00:09:53,354
Oh, no.

121
00:10:01,463 --> 00:10:03,331
Where are you going?

122
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,832
Out.

123
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:06,734
No, shit.
You got specifics?

124
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:08,970
What the hell is he doing?

125
00:10:08,972 --> 00:10:10,805
Something he shouldn't.

126
00:10:10,807 --> 00:10:12,974
We gotta stop him.

127
00:10:27,189 --> 00:10:28,389
Whoa!

128
00:10:28,391 --> 00:10:29,824
Make room for my freckled ass.

129
00:10:29,826 --> 00:10:31,125
No.

130
00:10:31,127 --> 00:10:33,027
Cover my watch.
You stay.

131
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:34,996
Hey, we should keep numbers here.

132
00:10:34,998 --> 00:10:36,197
I know where Daryl's going.

133
00:11:08,897 --> 00:11:10,865
What time did she leave?
Do you know what she took?

134
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:12,533
Sometime in the night.
I never heard her go,

135
00:11:12,535 --> 00:11:14,102
but she made a bunch
of food, you know.

136
00:11:14,104 --> 00:11:16,437
- She took her pack, one of my coats--
- Did she leave on foot?

137
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:18,206
I-- I don't know.

138
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:21,209
Rick, I took over at
12:00, I was on till 6:00.

139
00:11:21,211 --> 00:11:22,877
I never saw anything.

140
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:25,313
Front's been quiet
since the others left.

141
00:11:25,315 --> 00:11:26,748
What? Who?

142
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,450
Daryl. He went ICBM after
the Saviors from yesterday.

143
00:11:29,452 --> 00:11:33,821
Glenn, Michonne, Rosita, they all
went to shut that shit down.

144
00:11:33,823 --> 00:11:37,325
<i>Where's the other car?</i>

145
00:11:37,327 --> 00:11:39,894
We added two more cars yesterday.

146
00:11:39,896 --> 00:11:42,840
One of them's missing, the one we
put right between those houses.

147
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,133
You can barely see between
the houses from up top,

148
00:11:45,893 --> 00:11:47,092
especially at night.

149
00:11:47,094 --> 00:11:49,160
The note, can I see it?

150
00:11:49,773 --> 00:11:52,117
You never saw any
headlights, taillights?

151
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:54,713
She's smart enough
to cover her tracks.

152
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:57,716
<i>She must've left
during the shift change.</i>

153
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,017
Where are you going?

154
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,086
<i>I'm gonna go find her.</i>

155
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,621
Wait.

156
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,059
Tell Carl I'll be back soon.

157
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:09,227
No one else leaves.

158
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,329
Everyone else stays
ready for a fight.

159
00:13:43,826 --> 00:13:45,126
Hands up.

160
00:13:47,997 --> 00:13:49,831
Please don't hurt me.

161
00:13:50,315 --> 00:13:54,336
Why does everyone
always assume the worst?

162
00:13:54,338 --> 00:13:56,471
How 'bout you come on out?

163
00:14:09,585 --> 00:14:11,519
I just have the car.

164
00:14:17,727 --> 00:14:21,096
And a knife for the dead
ones, nothing else.

165
00:14:22,298 --> 00:14:25,934
Naw, you got information.

166
00:14:25,936 --> 00:14:29,070
Like where you're from,
where you're going.

167
00:14:31,316 --> 00:14:33,016
<i>Aw, come on, it's a lonely world.</i>

168
00:14:33,018 --> 00:14:34,751
<i>Let's get to know each other.</i>

169
00:14:34,753 --> 00:14:36,887
<i>I'm Jiro.</i>

170
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:39,289
<i>Your turn.</i>

171
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,758
I'm nobody, really.

172
00:14:43,461 --> 00:14:45,862
Nancy from Montclair.

173
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:51,401
But I've bounced around
a lot since then.

174
00:14:51,403 --> 00:14:53,603
I-- I keep moving.

175
00:14:55,406 --> 00:14:59,743
I'm not really from anywhere.
I'm not really going anywhere.

176
00:14:59,745 --> 00:15:01,278
<i>Well...</i>

177
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,449
at least we agree on one
thing, Nancy from Montclair--

178
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:08,919
you're not going anywhere.

179
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:12,689
But you do seem like
you're from somewhere.

180
00:15:12,691 --> 00:15:15,926
After Montclair, right?

181
00:15:15,928 --> 00:15:18,362
Miles, what's that place called?

182
00:15:18,364 --> 00:15:22,399
The gated one
12.75 clicks down?

183
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:24,334
<i>Alexandria.</i>

184
00:15:24,336 --> 00:15:27,270
Yeah, Alexandria.

185
00:15:27,272 --> 00:15:30,040
<i>You know, they got some cars out
front, spikes through them,</i>

186
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:32,509
<i>just like the one you're driving.</i>

187
00:15:33,678 --> 00:15:35,479
A woman like you,

188
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:38,648
no weapons, no protection,

189
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:41,318
no clue,

190
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,755
you really shouldn't
be out here alone.

191
00:15:44,757 --> 00:15:47,157
You know, we were just
on our way to your place.

192
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:49,393
<i>We can give you a ride back.</i>

193
00:15:49,395 --> 00:15:52,796
<i>Maybe they'll let us in
if you're with us.</i>

194
00:16:24,462 --> 00:16:25,996
It doesn't have to be this way.

195
00:16:25,998 --> 00:16:28,031
You could turn back
and you could go home.

196
00:16:28,033 --> 00:16:31,001
Nobody has to get hurt.

197
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:33,236
It's looking like
someone's gotta get hurt.

198
00:16:35,206 --> 00:16:38,075
Please.

199
00:16:38,077 --> 00:16:39,609
Please.

200
00:16:39,611 --> 00:16:41,771
Man, why don't you just grab
her before she passes out?

201
00:16:44,249 --> 00:16:46,216
<i>Don't, please!</i>

202
00:17:57,955 --> 00:17:59,823
I can see you.

203
00:17:59,825 --> 00:18:02,259
<i>Come out slowly.</i>

204
00:18:02,261 --> 00:18:05,162
<i>Yeah, I think I'm gonna pass on that.</i>

205
00:18:38,046 --> 00:18:39,647
- Hey.
- Hey.

206
00:18:43,552 --> 00:18:45,019
You look tired.

207
00:18:45,021 --> 00:18:47,488
We still have a lot to do.

208
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,491
Glenn, Michonne, and Rosita
just took off after Daryl.

209
00:18:50,493 --> 00:18:51,726
I'm taking an extra shift.

210
00:18:51,728 --> 00:18:53,961
Just packing a lunch
before I go back out.

211
00:18:57,799 --> 00:18:59,934
- See you later.
- Where are you going?

212
00:18:59,936 --> 00:19:01,502
Take your shift while you rest.

213
00:19:01,504 --> 00:19:03,738
Enid...

214
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,706
Just for a few hours.

215
00:19:07,676 --> 00:19:09,477
Let me help.

216
00:19:09,479 --> 00:19:12,313
Put up your feet
and eat some pickles.

217
00:19:23,158 --> 00:19:24,926
You didn't have to come.

218
00:19:26,195 --> 00:19:30,064
We have to try,
even if it's a long shot,

219
00:19:30,066 --> 00:19:31,799
even if it's dangerous.

220
00:19:33,835 --> 00:19:35,803
Tire tracks pointed east...

221
00:19:37,506 --> 00:19:39,740
we go east.

222
00:19:39,742 --> 00:19:42,109
Saviors' compound
that you and the group--

223
00:19:43,445 --> 00:19:45,846
that you went to,

224
00:19:45,848 --> 00:19:47,682
that was west.

225
00:19:52,254 --> 00:19:54,255
Seems like she went east.

226
00:20:01,363 --> 00:20:05,099
You don't even know Carol.

227
00:20:05,101 --> 00:20:07,435
Oh, I got to.

228
00:20:07,437 --> 00:20:09,337
A little.

229
00:20:14,176 --> 00:20:16,043
Why are you doing this?

230
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:24,919
What I believe--
I'm not right.

231
00:20:24,921 --> 00:20:28,689
There is no right.

232
00:20:28,691 --> 00:20:31,392
There's just the wrong
that doesn't pull you down.

233
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,667
It hasn't pulled me down.

234
00:20:42,437 --> 00:20:44,171
I think it will.

235
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,610
'Cause I know you.

236
00:20:59,822 --> 00:21:01,455
God dang--!

237
00:21:06,996 --> 00:21:09,497
Oh, man.

238
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,384
Shh.

239
00:21:30,386 --> 00:21:31,886
Shh!

240
00:21:33,855 --> 00:21:36,991
Just let it go, man.
Just let go.

241
00:21:49,838 --> 00:21:51,806
Oh, God.

242
00:22:06,588 --> 00:22:08,055
There.

243
00:22:08,057 --> 00:22:09,957
I see it.

244
00:22:26,641 --> 00:22:28,409
That's her car.

245
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,381
You see her?

246
00:22:37,953 --> 00:22:40,020
No.

247
00:22:49,598 --> 00:22:51,165
Hey, where is she?

248
00:23:14,723 --> 00:23:18,392
The Saviors were getting weapons
from the Hilltop's blacksmith.

249
00:23:18,394 --> 00:23:20,294
These men were Saviors.

250
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,244
There's blood here.

251
00:23:38,447 --> 00:23:40,247
She could've been hit.

252
00:23:45,821 --> 00:23:48,322
I'm proud of her.

253
00:23:48,324 --> 00:23:50,858
How's that?

254
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,428
She took four of them down.

255
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,630
That woman, she's a force of nature.

256
00:23:56,632 --> 00:23:59,133
She left because she can't anymore.

257
00:23:59,135 --> 00:24:00,634
That's what her letter said.

258
00:24:00,636 --> 00:24:03,304
She could because she had to.

259
00:24:04,339 --> 00:24:05,840
Sometimes you have to.

260
00:24:08,677 --> 00:24:11,946
There's more blood opposite these men

261
00:24:11,948 --> 00:24:14,081
<i>that leads into the field.</i>

262
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:16,650
It's a trail.
Could be Carol's.

263
00:24:16,652 --> 00:24:18,552
She could still be alive.

264
00:24:18,554 --> 00:24:20,287
She's not here.

265
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:22,356
<i>Most of their guns are gone.</i>

266
00:24:22,358 --> 00:24:24,091
She might've taken them.

267
00:24:24,093 --> 00:24:25,893
Those, too.

268
00:24:28,397 --> 00:24:31,966
Or she could've died here,

269
00:24:31,968 --> 00:24:34,468
even if she isn't here.

270
00:24:35,837 --> 00:24:37,438
Trail goes this way.

271
00:24:43,712 --> 00:24:46,347
They were close to Alexandria.

272
00:24:47,582 --> 00:24:49,884
There's even more of them.

273
00:24:49,886 --> 00:24:52,720
We didn't end it.

274
00:24:52,722 --> 00:24:55,222
No.

275
00:24:55,224 --> 00:24:57,191
You started something.

276
00:26:14,337 --> 00:26:16,203
That's where she died.

277
00:26:20,108 --> 00:26:22,209
All right, so he had
to start from here.

278
00:26:27,282 --> 00:26:28,616
He did.

279
00:26:30,218 --> 00:26:32,319
Which way did Dwight run?

280
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:36,590
Rosita?

281
00:26:40,395 --> 00:26:42,229
We should let him do this.

282
00:26:43,632 --> 00:26:46,433
But he doesn't know what he's doing.

283
00:26:46,435 --> 00:26:49,203
We don't.

284
00:26:49,205 --> 00:26:52,139
Maybe him trying this makes you
feel better about it right now.

285
00:26:52,141 --> 00:26:55,876
Maybe they keep knowing more about
us than we know about them.

286
00:26:55,878 --> 00:27:00,047
Or maybe Daryl's
gonna get himself killed.

287
00:27:03,718 --> 00:27:05,653
Which way did Dwight run?

288
00:27:54,969 --> 00:27:56,470
<i>Watch the hell out, asshole.</i>

289
00:27:56,472 --> 00:27:58,238
I did.
You shouldn't have come.

290
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,007
You shouldn't have left.

291
00:28:02,043 --> 00:28:04,511
When I split off
from Sasha and Abraham,

292
00:28:04,513 --> 00:28:07,181
he was out there in the woods, in that
burned-out forest with them girls,

293
00:28:07,183 --> 00:28:10,484
put a gun to my head, tied me up.

294
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,821
I even tried to help him.

295
00:28:13,823 --> 00:28:16,423
So, you think it's your fault?

296
00:28:16,425 --> 00:28:18,892
Yeah, I know it is.

297
00:28:18,894 --> 00:28:20,461
I'm gonna go do what I
should've done before.

298
00:28:20,463 --> 00:28:23,330
What, for her?

299
00:28:23,332 --> 00:28:25,899
She's gone, man.

300
00:28:25,901 --> 00:28:28,335
You're doing this for you.

301
00:28:28,337 --> 00:28:29,737
Man, I don't give a shit.

302
00:28:29,739 --> 00:28:31,605
Daryl...

303
00:28:33,241 --> 00:28:37,177
we need to get back there
and figure this out from home.

304
00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:39,947
Our home.

305
00:28:39,949 --> 00:28:43,650
We need you, and everyone back
there needs us right now.

306
00:28:46,254 --> 00:28:48,956
It's-- it's gonna
go wrong out here.

307
00:28:50,258 --> 00:28:53,961
We'll square it.
I will.

308
00:28:53,963 --> 00:28:56,864
I promise you.

309
00:28:56,866 --> 00:28:58,632
Just come back.

310
00:29:03,404 --> 00:29:05,506
I can't.

311
00:29:05,508 --> 00:29:07,574
- Daryl.
- Man, I can't!

312
00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:16,917
I can't either.

313
00:29:35,804 --> 00:29:39,973
Thing is, those men could
be back in Alexandria right now.

314
00:29:39,975 --> 00:29:41,675
If they are, they're dead.

315
00:29:41,677 --> 00:29:44,077
I hope not.

316
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:45,712
We need them alive.

317
00:29:45,714 --> 00:29:47,481
We need to find out more.

318
00:29:47,483 --> 00:29:50,284
Yeah, we do.

319
00:29:57,959 --> 00:30:00,460
We just got stuck with each other.

320
00:30:00,462 --> 00:30:03,063
We were lucky.

321
00:30:06,467 --> 00:30:08,468
We figured it all out together.

322
00:30:10,171 --> 00:30:12,272
It felt like we did.

323
00:30:12,274 --> 00:30:14,942
After everything, we did.

324
00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:24,117
The world's not
what we thought it was.

325
00:30:27,355 --> 00:30:30,424
Hilltop, the Saviors, it's bigger.

326
00:30:52,881 --> 00:30:54,448
Hi.

327
00:31:27,439 --> 00:31:30,374
It's not much.

328
00:31:30,739 --> 00:31:33,707
But if it's Carol's, then she's
been bleeding for a while.

329
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:43,183
So, you out here because
Carol is your friend?

330
00:31:43,185 --> 00:31:46,519
I'm out here 'cause she's my family.

331
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,458
I've talked to people back there.

332
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:55,395
I found out about
what happened at the prison.

333
00:31:55,397 --> 00:31:57,697
How you sent her away.

334
00:31:59,033 --> 00:32:00,867
She killed two of your people, right?

335
00:32:00,869 --> 00:32:02,636
Burned their bodies.

336
00:32:04,605 --> 00:32:07,540
What if that had happened today?

337
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:09,142
Would you kill her?

338
00:32:09,144 --> 00:32:12,245
If it happened today, I'd thank her.

339
00:32:12,247 --> 00:32:14,648
Or I would've killed them myself.

340
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:17,317
She was right to do it.

341
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:19,419
They were sick, spreading a disease.

342
00:32:19,421 --> 00:32:21,121
They weren't gonna make it.

343
00:32:22,156 --> 00:32:24,291
Yeah, but this was back then.

344
00:32:24,293 --> 00:32:26,259
And you didn't kill her.

345
00:32:27,295 --> 00:32:31,131
You sent her away, Rick,
and she came back.

346
00:32:31,133 --> 00:32:33,667
And she came back
and she saved all y'all.

347
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,538
People can come back, Rick.

348
00:33:00,294 --> 00:33:02,329
It's not her.

349
00:33:11,472 --> 00:33:14,240
<i>She couldn't have
been dead more than a day.</i>

350
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:42,869
Hey!

351
00:33:42,871 --> 00:33:44,504
Whoa, whoa!

352
00:33:44,506 --> 00:33:46,439
<i>It's okay. I'm not trouble.</i>

353
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,574
<i>I don't want any trouble.</i>

354
00:33:47,576 --> 00:33:50,210
Come out, drop your weapons.

355
00:33:50,212 --> 00:33:52,078
<i>I can't do that.</i>

356
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,047
<i>The wasted are too close.</i>

357
00:33:54,049 --> 00:33:56,716
<i>I'm just looking for my horse.
Have you seen him?</i>

358
00:33:56,718 --> 00:33:58,184
No.

359
00:34:00,187 --> 00:34:02,789
We're looking for our friend.
Have you seen her?

360
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:05,258
<i>Have you seen her?</i>

361
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,793
<i>They're coming!</i>

362
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:09,262
<i>Just go!
Just go!</i>

363
00:34:13,901 --> 00:34:15,235
Stop!

364
00:34:38,426 --> 00:34:40,126
Rick.

365
00:34:40,128 --> 00:34:41,394
We didn't know who he was.

366
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:46,199
Yeah, it's one of the Hilltop's.

367
00:34:46,201 --> 00:34:48,668
Like the one on the road.

368
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,137
Maybe he's one of them.

369
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:52,906
Maybe he's looking for Carol, too.

370
00:34:52,908 --> 00:34:55,008
Maybe the man is just
looking for a horse.

371
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:58,144
Maybe he is from Hilltop.
Maybe he's from somewhere else.

372
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:07,887
I don't take chances anymore.

373
00:35:18,098 --> 00:35:20,099
Those people...

374
00:35:21,268 --> 00:35:23,336
the Wolves...

375
00:35:25,172 --> 00:35:27,507
after they attacked,
I found one of them.

376
00:35:29,977 --> 00:35:32,445
He had attacked me
on the road before,

377
00:35:32,447 --> 00:35:34,514
when I was trying to find you.

378
00:35:34,516 --> 00:35:36,149
And I stopped him.

379
00:35:38,686 --> 00:35:41,621
But I let him live.

380
00:35:41,623 --> 00:35:44,257
And then he was there in
Alexandria after the attack,

381
00:35:44,259 --> 00:35:47,260
hiding in one of the brownstones,
so I stopped him again.

382
00:35:47,262 --> 00:35:50,463
I knocked him out
and I could have killed him.

383
00:35:54,502 --> 00:35:56,736
But all life is precious.

384
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:07,814
Put him in the cell
of the brownstone basement.

385
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:12,385
'Cause I knew he could change.

386
00:36:12,387 --> 00:36:14,053
We all can change.

387
00:36:14,055 --> 00:36:18,124
- You had one of them alive in the community?
- Oh, yeah.

388
00:36:18,126 --> 00:36:22,362
And when the walls came down and the
walkers broke in, Carol found out.

389
00:36:22,364 --> 00:36:24,697
We fought and that man escaped,

390
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:26,432
and Denise...

391
00:36:28,335 --> 00:36:30,370
she had come to the cell
to try and help him

392
00:36:30,372 --> 00:36:33,439
and he took her hostage.

393
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:38,378
And then she and that Wolf,
they got swarmed,

394
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,014
and that man, that killer,

395
00:36:41,016 --> 00:36:44,317
he saved her life.

396
00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:47,320
And then Denise
was there to save Carl.

397
00:36:47,322 --> 00:36:49,956
It--

398
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,991
it's all a circle.

399
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,161
Everything gets a return.

400
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:06,573
But the fact is the fact.

401
00:37:06,575 --> 00:37:09,208
I did what I did.

402
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:11,444
I let him live.

403
00:37:18,786 --> 00:37:21,554
You go home, Rick.

404
00:37:21,556 --> 00:37:24,824
You take the car.
You're needed back there.

405
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:26,993
You shouldn't be out here
taking any more chances.

406
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:28,761
I'm not leaving.

407
00:37:28,763 --> 00:37:32,098
- Carol's still out here.
- And I will find her.

408
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,866
Somehow.

409
00:37:36,437 --> 00:37:38,137
You go.

410
00:37:41,642 --> 00:37:43,610
You're coming back.

411
00:37:47,114 --> 00:37:49,482
Yeah.

412
00:37:49,484 --> 00:37:51,951
But if I don't, don't come looking.

413
00:37:56,957 --> 00:37:59,092
Take it.

414
00:37:59,094 --> 00:38:01,527
- No, I--
- Take it.

415
00:38:11,005 --> 00:38:13,039
Morgan?

416
00:38:20,648 --> 00:38:23,449
Michonne did steal that protein bar.

417
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,321
Oh, I know.

418
00:38:51,556 --> 00:38:55,226
Morgan's still out there looking.

419
00:38:55,228 --> 00:38:57,061
Is Michonne here?

420
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:00,331
She's still out there, too.

421
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,812
You afraid...

422
00:39:14,814 --> 00:39:16,914
to go back to it?

423
00:39:19,618 --> 00:39:21,919
Let somebody close?

424
00:39:28,612 --> 00:39:32,129
Yeah. Yeah.

425
00:39:34,099 --> 00:39:35,833
Mm.

426
00:39:37,653 --> 00:39:40,355
Me, too.

427
00:39:40,357 --> 00:39:42,691
But now...

428
00:39:46,028 --> 00:39:47,462
I think I'm that much more ready

429
00:39:47,464 --> 00:39:50,198
to tear the world
a brand-new asshole.

430
00:40:02,144 --> 00:40:04,312
Any second now.

431
00:40:06,348 --> 00:40:08,149
Yeah.

432
00:40:09,952 --> 00:40:11,086
Any second.

433
00:40:35,044 --> 00:40:37,846
Scott said you were looking for me?

434
00:40:37,848 --> 00:40:39,714
What's up?

435
00:40:42,218 --> 00:40:44,285
I need some more help.

436
00:41:00,336 --> 00:41:02,070
<i>I like it.</i>

437
00:41:02,072 --> 00:41:03,738
<i>But why?</i>

438
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:09,344
Hmm.
I have to keep going.

439
00:41:12,581 --> 00:41:15,150
And I don't want anything
getting in my way.

440
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:24,893
Man, did I go too short?

441
00:41:24,895 --> 00:41:27,228
I-I only used
to cut my dad's.

442
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,230
No, it's not that.

443
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,434
Maggie?

444
00:41:33,436 --> 00:41:35,537
Ah!

445
00:41:37,072 --> 00:41:39,407
Maggie.

446
00:41:39,409 --> 00:41:41,409
Maggie!

447
00:42:18,147 --> 00:42:20,448
Hi, Daryl.

448
00:42:33,078 --> 00:42:35,063
<i>You'll be all right.</i>
