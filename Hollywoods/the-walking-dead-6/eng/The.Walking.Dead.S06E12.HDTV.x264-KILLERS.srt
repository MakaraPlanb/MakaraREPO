00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:05,729
You're well-equipped,
but your provisions are low.

3
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:07,569
<i>I'm from a place that's
a lot like this one.</i>

4
00:00:07,634 --> 00:00:09,851
<i>We might be in a position
to help each other.</i>

5
00:00:09,937 --> 00:00:11,219
<i>This is Gregory.</i>

6
00:00:11,305 --> 00:00:12,804
I'm the boss.

7
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:13,972
They still have Craig.

8
00:00:14,091 --> 00:00:14,806
Negan?

9
00:00:14,892 --> 00:00:15,941
They said they'd
return him to us,

10
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,058
if I delivered a message to you.

11
00:00:17,194 --> 00:00:19,060
<i>You give us supplies,</i>

12
00:00:19,146 --> 00:00:20,346
we'll save Craig and take care

13
00:00:20,397 --> 00:00:21,563
of Negan and the Saviors.

14
00:00:21,698 --> 00:00:22,898
Done.

15
00:00:22,983 --> 00:00:25,150
We need to know what you
know about Negan's compound.

16
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:26,235
We need you to come.

17
00:00:26,286 --> 00:00:26,902
It's gonna be a fight.

18
00:00:27,037 --> 00:00:35,037
We'll win. We have to.

- Hey, Carol.
- Tobin.

49
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,201
You deserve some cookies.

50
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:42,570
Oh, no, not with
the kids as hungry--

51
00:02:42,572 --> 00:02:45,940
No, there's plenty.
I foraged a lot of acorns.

52
00:02:51,548 --> 00:02:54,115
- They're pink.
- Beets.

53
00:02:54,117 --> 00:02:56,167
- Beets?
- It's what makes them sweet.

54
00:02:56,169 --> 00:02:58,870
Oh.

55
00:02:58,872 --> 00:03:01,623
I never was much
of a beet kind of guy.

56
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,591
Will you just put it
in your mouth, jerk.

57
00:03:14,656 --> 00:03:19,974
They're the best beet and acorn
cookies I've ever eaten.

58
00:03:21,645 --> 00:03:22,977
Are you screwing with me?

59
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:25,146
No.

60
00:03:25,148 --> 00:03:27,816
Seriously.

61
00:03:27,818 --> 00:03:29,284
They're amazing.

62
00:03:29,286 --> 00:03:31,069
<i>They're back!</i>

63
00:03:48,338 --> 00:03:50,338
Get Olivia.

64
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,340
She should inventory
what we have.

65
00:03:52,342 --> 00:03:53,612
We'll meet her at the pantry.

66
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:55,973
- You have food?
- Yeah.

67
00:03:55,975 --> 00:03:59,293
Enough for another month.

68
00:03:59,295 --> 00:04:01,662
<i>I need everybody in
the church in an hour.</i>

69
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,847
What is it?

70
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:05,249
We'll talk about it.

71
00:04:09,388 --> 00:04:12,139
Rick, what's going on?

72
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,392
We're gonna have to fight.

73
00:04:52,265 --> 00:04:54,682
It's been a while.

74
00:04:54,684 --> 00:04:56,467
Weeks.

75
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:59,803
- Since what?
- Since we talked.

76
00:04:59,805 --> 00:05:02,189
That's what we did in that cell?
We talked.

77
00:05:07,013 --> 00:05:09,980
Why didn't you tell Rick?

78
00:05:09,982 --> 00:05:13,317
Tara, Rosita, Eugene?

79
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:17,588
- Why didn't they...?
- I told them to keep quiet about it.

80
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,456
Why?

81
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,992
Can we just forget it,
move past it?

82
00:05:24,163 --> 00:05:25,746
You don't have to carry that.

83
00:05:25,748 --> 00:05:27,331
Carry what?

84
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:30,000
You know what I did.

85
00:05:30,002 --> 00:05:31,669
You don't want
to tell anyone, it--

86
00:05:35,224 --> 00:05:37,241
it's kind of like
you did it, too.

87
00:05:37,243 --> 00:05:39,727
No, it's not.

88
00:05:43,182 --> 00:05:45,816
Just go.

<i>And we can work
with the Hilltop.</i>

91
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:52,753
<i>Maggie hammered out a deal.</i>

92
00:06:52,755 --> 00:06:54,821
<i>We're getting food--</i>

93
00:06:54,823 --> 00:06:57,891
<i>eggs, butter, fresh vegetables.</i>

94
00:06:57,893 --> 00:07:01,194
<i>But they're not
just giving it away.</i>

95
00:07:01,196 --> 00:07:03,780
<i>These Saviors,</i>

96
00:07:03,782 --> 00:07:07,033
<i>they almost killed Sasha,
Daryl, and Abraham on the road.</i>

97
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:09,653
<i>Now, sooner or later,
they would've found us,</i>

98
00:07:09,655 --> 00:07:11,571
<i>just like those Wolves did,</i>

99
00:07:11,573 --> 00:07:13,407
<i>just like Jesus did.</i>

100
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:17,043
<i>They woulda killed someone
or some of us.</i>

101
00:07:17,045 --> 00:07:19,830
And then they
would try to own us.

102
00:07:19,832 --> 00:07:23,083
And we would try to stop them.

103
00:07:23,085 --> 00:07:25,752
<i>But by then,
in that kind of fight,</i>

104
00:07:25,754 --> 00:07:29,890
<i>low on food, we could lose.</i>

105
00:07:29,892 --> 00:07:31,842
<i>This is the only way to be sure,</i>

106
00:07:31,844 --> 00:07:34,394
<i>as sure as we can get,
that we win.</i>

107
00:07:34,396 --> 00:07:36,847
<i>And we have to win.</i>

108
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:40,600
<i>We do this for the Hilltop,</i>

109
00:07:40,602 --> 00:07:43,019
it's how we keep this place.

110
00:07:43,021 --> 00:07:45,522
It's how we feed this place.

111
00:07:46,775 --> 00:07:48,775
<i>This needs to be
a group decision.</i>

112
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:55,415
If anybody objects, here's
your chance to say your piece.

113
00:08:04,293 --> 00:08:06,126
You're sure we can do it?

114
00:08:10,549 --> 00:08:11,798
We can beat them?

115
00:08:13,602 --> 00:08:16,186
What this group has done,
what we've learned,

116
00:08:16,188 --> 00:08:18,305
what we've become,
all of us--

117
00:08:18,307 --> 00:08:20,607
yes, I'm sure.

118
00:08:20,609 --> 00:08:22,809
Then all we have to do
is just tell them that.

119
00:08:22,811 --> 00:08:24,478
<i>Well, they don't compromise.</i>

120
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,281
This isn't a compromise.

121
00:08:28,283 --> 00:08:30,567
It's a choice you give them.

122
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:32,686
It's a way out,
for them and for us.

123
00:08:32,688 --> 00:08:34,454
<i>We try and talk to the Saviors,</i>

124
00:08:34,456 --> 00:08:36,756
<i>we give up our advantage,
our safety.</i>

125
00:08:36,758 --> 00:08:41,495
No, we have to come for them
before they come for us.

126
00:08:41,497 --> 00:08:43,914
We can't leave them alive.

127
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,750
Where there's life,
there's possibility.

128
00:08:46,752 --> 00:08:48,084
Of them hitting us.

129
00:08:48,086 --> 00:08:49,803
<i>We're not trapped in this.</i>

130
00:08:49,805 --> 00:08:51,888
None of you are trapped in this.

131
00:08:54,443 --> 00:08:55,942
<i>Morgan...</i>

132
00:08:55,944 --> 00:08:59,229
they always come back.

133
00:08:59,231 --> 00:09:01,681
Come back
when they're dead, too.

134
00:09:01,683 --> 00:09:03,683
Yeah, we'll stop them.
We have before.

135
00:09:03,685 --> 00:09:07,654
I'm not talking
about the walkers.

136
00:09:07,656 --> 00:09:11,107
Morgan wants
to talk to them first.

137
00:09:11,109 --> 00:09:13,693
I think that would be a mistake,

138
00:09:13,695 --> 00:09:15,278
<i>but it's not up to me.</i>

139
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,030
<i>I'll talk to the people
still at home.</i>

140
00:09:17,032 --> 00:09:19,432
<i>I'll discuss it
with the people on guard now, too,</i>

141
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:24,170
but who else wants to approach
the Saviors, talk to them first?

142
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:26,873
What happened here,

143
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,625
<i>we won't let that happen again.</i>

144
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:32,479
I won't.

145
00:09:45,761 --> 00:09:47,427
Looks like it's settled.

146
00:09:49,431 --> 00:09:51,231
<i>We know exactly what this is.</i>

147
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:54,951
We don't shy from it, we live.

148
00:09:56,872 --> 00:09:58,405
We kill them all.

149
00:10:06,248 --> 00:10:09,082
<i>We don't all have to kill.</i>

150
00:10:09,084 --> 00:10:11,968
But if people
are gonna stay here...

151
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:15,839
they do have to accept it.

152
00:11:07,743 --> 00:11:10,543
We need someone on the
perimeter keeping watch.

153
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:13,046
That could be me.

154
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,148
That would be safe.

155
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,449
Safer.

156
00:11:21,356 --> 00:11:23,373
Whatever safer looks like now.

157
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,791
Yeah.

158
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:28,328
I made that deal.

159
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,915
It wasn't my idea,
but I led us into this.

160
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,302
I have to come.

161
00:11:43,095 --> 00:11:45,929
Those things'll kill you.

162
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:48,815
You got another one?

163
00:11:48,817 --> 00:11:50,817
Not for you.

164
00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:52,352
And why is that?

165
00:11:52,354 --> 00:11:54,320
'Cause, asshole.

166
00:11:54,322 --> 00:11:57,023
Okay.

167
00:11:58,443 --> 00:12:00,660
Couldn't sleep either?

168
00:12:00,662 --> 00:12:02,612
I never could sleep.

169
00:12:10,005 --> 00:12:12,038
Worried about tomorrow.

170
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,090
You going?

171
00:12:14,092 --> 00:12:16,509
No.

172
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,761
You are.

173
00:12:21,683 --> 00:12:24,751
You can
do things that--

174
00:12:26,154 --> 00:12:28,421
that just terrify me.

175
00:12:33,812 --> 00:12:35,395
How?

176
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:41,484
How do you think
I do those things?

177
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,073
You're a mom.

178
00:12:47,075 --> 00:12:48,742
I was.

179
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:53,213
You<i> are.</i>

180
00:12:53,215 --> 00:12:55,165
It-- it--

181
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:59,052
it's not the cookies
or the smiles.

182
00:12:59,054 --> 00:13:00,887
It's--

183
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:03,389
it's the hard stuff.

184
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,677
The scary stuff.

185
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,097
It's how you can do it.

186
00:13:13,151 --> 00:13:14,684
It's strength.

187
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:20,774
You're a mom to most
of the people here.

188
00:13:26,581 --> 00:13:28,164
To you, too?

189
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,086
No.

190
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,957
You're something else to me.

191
00:13:56,978 --> 00:13:58,978
Well, it's not tomorrow yet.

192
00:14:02,868 --> 00:14:05,068
Packing your stilettos?

193
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,402
We'll only be gone a night.

194
00:14:06,404 --> 00:14:07,704
I'm going.

195
00:14:07,706 --> 00:14:09,656
I am, too, but tomorrow.

196
00:14:12,244 --> 00:14:14,544
I'm leaving.

197
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,336
Why?

198
00:14:23,338 --> 00:14:25,088
<i>It happens.</i>

199
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,176
Are you serious?

200
00:14:30,178 --> 00:14:31,878
This is how I want it.

201
00:14:33,849 --> 00:14:36,516
- Why?
- Why are dingleberries brown?

202
00:14:36,518 --> 00:14:38,685
It's just the way shit is.

203
00:14:38,687 --> 00:14:40,687
No, no. After everything
we've been through,

204
00:14:40,689 --> 00:14:43,523
you are not walking out that
door unless you can tell me why.

205
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:45,241
Tell me!

206
00:14:45,243 --> 00:14:47,327
Tell me why!

207
00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:49,245
When I first met you,

208
00:14:49,247 --> 00:14:52,081
I thought you were
the last woman on Earth.

209
00:14:53,668 --> 00:14:55,368
You're not.

210
00:15:20,228 --> 00:15:23,229
You try one of these?
They're chewy.

211
00:15:23,231 --> 00:15:25,565
They, uh...

212
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:27,033
got some fight in them.

213
00:15:34,075 --> 00:15:35,541
<i>Describe it.</i>

214
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:38,461
Rectangular building,
big satellites on it.

215
00:15:38,463 --> 00:15:41,247
<i>- Any windows?</i>
- I don't remember any.

216
00:15:41,249 --> 00:15:43,249
I think they made it
so there's only one way in.

217
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:45,585
<i>Guards outside?</i>

218
00:15:45,587 --> 00:15:47,921
Yeah, two of them, at least.

219
00:15:47,923 --> 00:15:50,139
<i>And you don't know
how many people they have?</i>

220
00:15:50,141 --> 00:15:51,591
No.

221
00:15:53,511 --> 00:15:56,346
Uh, I mean, no. I saw a place
where they stored food.

222
00:15:56,348 --> 00:15:57,981
It wasn't that big, so...

223
00:15:57,983 --> 00:16:01,067
<i>- You've been inside?</i>
- Yeah.

224
00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:02,936
They had us load in
supplies one time.

225
00:16:02,938 --> 00:16:05,438
Hmm.
What do you remember?

226
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:09,108
Are you worried?

227
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,777
No.

228
00:16:12,864 --> 00:16:14,998
No, it's just...

229
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,285
I love you, and I just
wanted to say it before--

230
00:16:19,287 --> 00:16:21,788
you don't have to say it back.

231
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,256
It's--

232
00:16:23,258 --> 00:16:26,125
I'll say it when you come back.

233
00:16:26,127 --> 00:16:28,461
Heath and I are still
going on that two-weeker.

234
00:16:28,463 --> 00:16:31,965
We're gonna leave from there.

235
00:16:31,967 --> 00:16:33,633
Do you want to come?

236
00:16:33,635 --> 00:16:37,186
I mean, I can change it so we
don't leave from the compound.

237
00:16:37,188 --> 00:16:38,721
We could come back and we
could leave from here.

238
00:16:38,723 --> 00:16:41,307
- You know, we're gonna get meds, so...
- I can't.

239
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:44,310
- No, I didn't-- I'm-- I just-- I need to be here.
- Yeah.

240
00:16:44,312 --> 00:16:46,362
I'm the only doctor now.

241
00:16:46,364 --> 00:16:47,897
So I can't.

242
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:49,565
Yeah.

243
00:16:54,906 --> 00:16:56,406
But I want to.

244
00:17:00,378 --> 00:17:02,161
I'll tell you
when you come back.

245
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,249
Yeah.

246
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:16,426
<i>And you didn't
see any other rooms?</i>

247
00:17:16,428 --> 00:17:19,512
No, it's a big place.

248
00:17:19,514 --> 00:17:21,514
This is the hallway I saw.

249
00:17:21,516 --> 00:17:23,182
There is more.

250
00:17:23,184 --> 00:17:26,986
And every time, they had you
bring things into here?

251
00:17:26,988 --> 00:17:29,439
Jesus.

252
00:17:29,441 --> 00:17:30,990
We brought a couple
spears for them.

253
00:17:30,992 --> 00:17:33,493
Two of the Saviors took
them down this hallway.

254
00:17:33,495 --> 00:17:35,445
Now, they must've
done something with them

255
00:17:35,447 --> 00:17:37,280
because they didn't
come back with them.

256
00:17:37,282 --> 00:17:40,199
<i>Maybe a weapons
locker, an armory.</i>

257
00:17:40,201 --> 00:17:41,367
Okay.

258
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:44,337
We get in there,
secure the armory,

259
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:46,205
that's how we end it.

260
00:17:46,207 --> 00:17:48,708
That's how Carol ended it here.

261
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,515
But we don't know if they have
an armory or where it even is.

262
00:17:55,517 --> 00:17:58,601
Well, we've got
a lot of good guesses.

263
00:17:58,603 --> 00:18:00,303
We've done more with less.

264
00:18:00,305 --> 00:18:02,605
We go in at night
while they're sleeping.

265
00:18:02,607 --> 00:18:05,391
The guards won't be sleeping.

266
00:18:05,393 --> 00:18:08,227
Like I said, I think
there's only one way in

267
00:18:08,229 --> 00:18:09,445
and there's no way
to bust through that door

268
00:18:09,447 --> 00:18:10,947
<i>without waking up
the rest of them.</i>

269
00:18:10,949 --> 00:18:13,116
We don't need to.

270
00:18:13,118 --> 00:18:16,202
They're going to open it for
us, let us walk right in.

271
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:19,789
They want Gregory's head, right?

272
00:18:23,294 --> 00:18:25,161
We're gonna give it to them.

273
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:55,492
Aaron, Rosita.

274
00:18:55,494 --> 00:18:58,745
You start here.

275
00:18:58,747 --> 00:19:01,181
We'll peel off
every quarter mile,

276
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:04,251
meet back here
in a couple of hours.

277
00:19:04,253 --> 00:19:06,086
See what we got.

278
00:19:10,092 --> 00:19:13,060
There's no turning back now.

279
00:19:13,062 --> 00:19:15,596
I could walk.

280
00:19:15,598 --> 00:19:18,932
Maybe run a little, maybe a lot.

281
00:19:18,934 --> 00:19:20,901
I'm not going anywhere.

282
00:19:20,903 --> 00:19:23,353
I wanted to learn and you
taught me for a reason.

283
00:19:26,976 --> 00:19:29,409
Why are you still wearing that?

284
00:19:32,498 --> 00:19:34,781
It's still who I was.

285
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,783
I think.

286
00:19:38,504 --> 00:19:40,954
And it'll be harder for
them to see me in the dark.

287
00:19:54,637 --> 00:19:57,137
I almost told everyone
at the meeting.

288
00:19:57,139 --> 00:19:59,640
We're not telling them.

289
00:19:59,642 --> 00:20:02,676
Morgan stood up in that church and
tried to talk us out of this.

290
00:20:02,678 --> 00:20:04,678
What's wrong with that?

291
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,481
Maybe that he didn't know what
the hell he's talking about?

292
00:20:07,483 --> 00:20:09,383
That he should take the win

293
00:20:09,385 --> 00:20:11,118
that we didn't kick his ass out
for hiding that psychopath.

294
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,904
If we told everyone, they'd find
out about Denise, you know that.

295
00:20:15,624 --> 00:20:17,741
That<i> hijo de puta</i>
tried to stand there

296
00:20:17,743 --> 00:20:20,394
and act like we didn't
know what we were--

297
00:20:20,396 --> 00:20:21,962
He doesn't want to kill.

298
00:20:21,964 --> 00:20:24,748
We don't want to kill.
We don't like it.

299
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,934
It happens.

300
00:20:32,975 --> 00:20:34,574
I'm not telling anyone.

301
00:21:17,353 --> 00:21:18,685
What do you think?

302
00:21:18,687 --> 00:21:20,454
Maybe.

303
00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:24,775
If we, um, cut the hair...

304
00:21:25,828 --> 00:21:28,729
<i>trim the beard.</i>

305
00:21:28,731 --> 00:21:30,564
<i>If it's dark.</i>

306
00:21:34,987 --> 00:21:37,704
We're gonna kill those people.

307
00:21:37,706 --> 00:21:39,122
Tonight.

308
00:21:41,126 --> 00:21:43,043
Look, I've been lucky.

309
00:21:43,045 --> 00:21:46,346
I haven't had to do it before.

310
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:48,248
Have you?

311
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,251
I've been lucky, too.

312
00:21:51,253 --> 00:21:52,519
You nervous?

313
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:00,811
Have you ever seen
something that, um...

314
00:22:00,813 --> 00:22:04,097
afterwards, you--

315
00:22:04,099 --> 00:22:07,067
you didn't want to sleep

316
00:22:07,069 --> 00:22:10,103
and you weren't hungry because
when you close your eyes

317
00:22:10,105 --> 00:22:11,938
you could see it?

318
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:16,576
- And when you try to eat--
- Yeah.

319
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,163
Me, too.

320
00:22:25,204 --> 00:22:27,988
Killing somebody has gotta
be worse than that.

321
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,823
It has to be.

322
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:34,761
So, yeah...

323
00:22:34,763 --> 00:22:37,047
I'm nervous.

324
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:39,216
For the whole thing, man.

325
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:42,269
For the whole thing.

326
00:22:56,485 --> 00:22:58,285
We're gonna take a look around,

327
00:22:58,287 --> 00:23:01,154
try to get a feel for how
many people are in there.

328
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:07,461
We like how it looks, we go in.

329
00:23:07,463 --> 00:23:10,914
A couple of hours before dawn.

330
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:13,383
The guards outside'll be tired.

331
00:23:13,385 --> 00:23:15,836
<i>Everyone inside'll be sleeping.</i>

332
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,308
We don't like what we see, we
head back, make a new plan.

333
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:24,010
They don't know who we are.

334
00:23:24,012 --> 00:23:27,147
<i>We'll keep Jesus in the shadows.</i>

335
00:23:27,149 --> 00:23:28,715
This is how we eat.

336
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:32,769
This is how we eat.

337
00:23:35,691 --> 00:23:37,741
We roll out at midnight.

338
00:23:49,037 --> 00:23:50,570
Why is Maggie here?

339
00:23:50,572 --> 00:23:52,739
She's guarding the perimeter.

340
00:23:52,741 --> 00:23:55,208
Yeah, but why is she here?

341
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:57,844
'Cause it's her choice.

342
00:23:57,846 --> 00:23:59,296
I want to stay
out there with her.

343
00:23:59,298 --> 00:24:01,631
Well, this whole thing's
a race to the armory.

344
00:24:01,633 --> 00:24:04,050
We need as many people
inside as we can get.

345
00:24:04,052 --> 00:24:05,385
She shouldn't
be out there alone.

346
00:24:05,387 --> 00:24:07,721
She shouldn't be out here
in the first place.

347
00:24:13,061 --> 00:24:15,128
Okay.

348
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,563
Good.

349
00:24:21,453 --> 00:24:23,703
She's done with the hair?

350
00:24:23,705 --> 00:24:25,071
What've we got?

351
00:24:25,073 --> 00:24:27,407
- That one.
- Yeah, that's it.

352
00:24:29,411 --> 00:24:31,661
<i>All right.</i>

353
00:24:31,663 --> 00:24:34,381
Though, it's probably good
we're doing this at night.

354
00:24:36,168 --> 00:24:38,168
Something wrong with it?

355
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:41,805
The nose. Gregory's
is a different shape.

356
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:54,434
He fought back.

357
00:24:54,436 --> 00:24:57,604
He broke your hand, right?

358
00:24:57,606 --> 00:24:59,773
Guess there's no reason
to be subtle about it.

359
00:25:04,696 --> 00:25:05,996
What?

360
00:25:05,998 --> 00:25:08,832
The Saviors, they're scary,

361
00:25:08,834 --> 00:25:10,850
but those pricks
got nothing on you.

362
00:25:37,198 --> 00:25:39,783
<i>Stop right there!</i>

363
00:25:39,785 --> 00:25:41,985
<i>Announce yourself, asshole!</i>

364
00:25:41,987 --> 00:25:44,071
It's Eddie from Hilltop!

365
00:25:44,073 --> 00:25:45,572
It's done!

366
00:25:45,574 --> 00:25:47,657
<i>Step out!</i>

367
00:25:59,838 --> 00:26:01,421
<i>Is that it?</i>

368
00:26:01,423 --> 00:26:04,091
Yeah!

369
00:26:04,093 --> 00:26:06,226
<i>Bring it here, shit brain!</i>

370
00:26:21,577 --> 00:26:24,111
I don't want the bag,
needle dick.

371
00:26:37,042 --> 00:26:39,342
Will you look at this shit?

372
00:26:39,344 --> 00:26:42,712
Will you look at this shit?

373
00:26:57,446 --> 00:27:01,231
He broke my hand.
I broke his nose.

374
00:27:01,233 --> 00:27:03,233
That's why he looks that way.

375
00:27:24,339 --> 00:27:26,173
Little bitch broke my nose.

376
00:27:26,175 --> 00:27:28,842
Wah.

377
00:27:36,101 --> 00:27:40,270
Okay, looks like you learned.

378
00:27:40,272 --> 00:27:42,489
I'll get your guy,
you'll go home,

379
00:27:42,491 --> 00:27:45,108
and you bring us more
stuff next week, hmm?

380
00:28:29,821 --> 00:28:31,955
Well, well, well.
Look who it is.

381
00:28:34,209 --> 00:28:36,243
Ahh!

382
00:28:36,245 --> 00:28:38,495
It's okay, it's okay.

383
00:28:38,497 --> 00:28:40,417
<i>We're bringing you back.
We're bringing you back.</i>

384
00:29:01,653 --> 00:29:04,020
Check the doors.
Find the arsenal.

385
00:29:04,022 --> 00:29:05,572
We take them out.

386
00:32:32,113 --> 00:32:34,030
You still a priest?

387
00:32:38,737 --> 00:32:41,404
Rick and Carl
taught me about guns,

388
00:32:41,406 --> 00:32:45,074
other weapons.

389
00:32:45,076 --> 00:32:46,826
How to contribute.

390
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:53,967
I'm still a priest.

391
00:33:00,258 --> 00:33:02,141
I lied to my girlfriend
this morning.

392
00:33:04,563 --> 00:33:09,098
I, um-- she caught me
thinking about something,

393
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,150
so I told her that I loved her.

394
00:33:12,521 --> 00:33:15,772
For the first time.

395
00:33:15,774 --> 00:33:18,691
That's how I told her,
covering something up.

396
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:24,447
What were you covering?

397
00:33:26,034 --> 00:33:28,668
That I'd done something
like this before.

398
00:33:29,704 --> 00:33:31,788
That I didn't like it.

399
00:33:34,092 --> 00:33:35,842
Do you?

400
00:33:39,798 --> 00:33:42,048
Do you love her?

401
00:33:43,101 --> 00:33:46,886
Yeah.

402
00:33:46,888 --> 00:33:49,522
So, you know what
you're fighting for.

403
00:34:10,462 --> 00:34:12,045
Hmm.

404
00:34:12,047 --> 00:34:13,246
Honeypot.

405
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,656
They're in trouble.
Stay here.

406
00:34:39,658 --> 00:34:41,190
- I'm going with you.
- I said stay here.

407
00:34:41,192 --> 00:34:42,408
No.

408
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:44,110
Damn it, Maggie.

409
00:34:44,112 --> 00:34:47,080
- I have to.
- No, you don't. You don't have to.

410
00:34:47,082 --> 00:34:48,364
Yes, I do.

411
00:34:48,366 --> 00:34:50,199
<i>What the hell
are you doing here?</i>

412
00:34:50,201 --> 00:34:51,784
What am I supposed to do?

413
00:34:51,786 --> 00:34:53,536
You're supposed
to be someone else.

414
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,425
They need our help.

415
00:35:12,891 --> 00:35:14,941
You are staying here.

416
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,456
We need to go. Get them
back to the Hilltop.

417
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,992
What? Your people
could be in trouble.

418
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:30,794
If you get them back,
the deal's still on, right?

419
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:32,462
Right?

420
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:33,797
If they get themselves back.

421
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:36,633
Andy, drive him
back to the Hilltop.

422
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:44,174
Look, if they see you
and we don't make it--

423
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:46,476
We're gonna make it. And
they're not gonna see me.

424
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,846
Are you kidding?

425
00:35:56,438 --> 00:35:58,488
Go!

426
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:22,128
Ah!

427
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:27,517
If it wasn't us,
it was gonna be you.

428
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:35,558
The hell?

429
00:36:47,989 --> 00:36:50,270
That's one of the locked ones.
I'm gonna cover you. Do it.

430
00:37:05,173 --> 00:37:06,890
Come on!

431
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:38,264
So, this is the next world.

432
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,242
Drop it.

433
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:52,161
<i>Drop it.</i>

434
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,697
You, uh--

435
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:56,332
you gonna kill me, Padre?

436
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:01,621
<i>Padre?</i>

437
00:39:01,623 --> 00:39:03,873
"Let not your heart
be troubled."

438
00:39:06,378 --> 00:39:08,044
You're just as dead as me.

439
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:11,714
"In my father's house
are many mansions.

440
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,549
If it were not so,
I would've told you."

441
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:15,885
You're all dead.

442
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:19,022
- "I go prepare a place for you."
- Blood's coming.

443
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,730
Amen.

444
00:39:49,431 --> 00:39:54,133
Hey, you want to just
come back with us?

445
00:39:54,135 --> 00:39:56,836
Take a couple days before
you and Tara go out again?

446
00:39:56,838 --> 00:40:00,256
No, man. I just want
to get out of here.

Just--

462
00:41:28,146 --> 00:41:30,897
just want to know which
one of them was Negan.

463
00:41:35,937 --> 00:41:37,470
Son of a bitch!

464
00:41:48,866 --> 00:41:50,216
Where'd you get the bike?

465
00:41:52,287 --> 00:41:54,654
Just do it!

466
00:41:54,656 --> 00:41:56,672

everyone else, right?

<i>All of you, lower your
weapons right now.</i>

470
00:42:15,526 --> 00:42:18,444
Come on out.

471
00:42:18,446 --> 00:42:20,863
Let's talk.

472
00:42:20,865 --> 00:42:23,316
<i>We're not coming
out, but we will talk.</i>

473
00:42:26,988 --> 00:42:29,322

474
00:42:29,324 --> 00:42:31,805

you want to chat about.</i>
