00:00:00,182 --> 00:00:03,422
Previously on AMC's The Walking Dead....

2
00:00:03,542 --> 00:00:06,226
Everyone! Get into your houses!
Go!

3
00:00:06,663 --> 00:00:07,903
<i>My friend's
are in there.</i>

4
00:00:07,931 --> 00:00:09,664
<i>My pregnant wife.</i>

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,750
No!

6
00:00:10,834 --> 00:00:11,834
Argh!

7
00:00:13,704 --> 00:00:15,300
Ugh!
No!

8
00:00:16,123 --> 00:00:18,206
<i>You're not gonna
make it out there.</i>

9
00:00:18,292 --> 00:00:19,708
<i>We'll see.</i>

10
00:00:19,793 --> 00:00:21,153
<i>We're gonna
gut these things.</i>

11
00:00:21,178 --> 00:00:22,970
<i>It'll mask our smell.</i>

12
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,429
<i>Make 'em think we're like them.</i>

13
00:00:24,548 --> 00:00:27,103
<i>Stay calm.
Don't draw attention.</i>

14
00:00:27,223 --> 00:00:28,971
- <i>We can move right through 'em.</i>
- Mom.

15
00:00:49,088 --> 00:00:52,756
Why don't you come on out,
join us in the road?

16
00:00:53,944 --> 00:00:54,945
That's great.

17
00:00:55,065 --> 00:00:57,094
It's going well
right out of the gate.

18
00:00:57,096 --> 00:00:59,630
Now, step two,
hand over your weapons.

19
00:00:59,632 --> 00:01:03,200
- Why should we?
- Well, they're not yours.

20
00:01:03,202 --> 00:01:05,302
Whose are they?

21
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,285
Your property
now belongs to Negan.

22
00:01:19,628 --> 00:01:22,629
And if you can get your
hands on a tanker,

23
00:01:22,631 --> 00:01:25,232
you're people our person
wants to know.

24
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:29,236
So let's get those
sidearms, shall we?

25
00:01:31,106 --> 00:01:32,639
Right now.

26
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,564
Thank you.

27
00:01:45,954 --> 00:01:47,487
Thank you.

28
00:01:54,797 --> 00:01:56,963
If you have to eat shit,

29
00:01:56,965 --> 00:01:59,299
best not to nibble.

30
00:01:59,301 --> 00:02:02,169
Bite, chew, swallow, repeat.

31
00:02:02,171 --> 00:02:03,970
It goes quicker.

32
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,683
Thank you.

33
00:02:19,605 --> 00:02:21,655
Who are you people?

34
00:02:21,657 --> 00:02:24,357
I get the curiosity,

35
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:26,560
but we have questions ourselves.

36
00:02:27,963 --> 00:02:30,864
And we'll be
the ones asking them

37
00:02:30,866 --> 00:02:34,868
while we drive you back to
wherever it is you call home.

38
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,771
Take a gander at where
you hang your hats.

39
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:42,375
First, though, your shit.

40
00:02:42,377 --> 00:02:43,910
<i>What have you got for us?</i>

41
00:02:43,912 --> 00:02:45,412
Yeah, you just took it.

42
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,517
Come on.

43
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,886
I mean, can we not, okay?

44
00:02:52,888 --> 00:02:54,988
<i>There's more.</i>

45
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,524
<i>There is always more.</i>

46
00:03:01,697 --> 00:03:04,431
T...

47
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:07,234
take my man to the back
of the truck,

48
00:03:07,236 --> 00:03:09,202
start inside the back bumper,

49
00:03:09,204 --> 00:03:11,671
<i>work your way to the front.</i>

50
00:03:11,673 --> 00:03:12,839
Go.

51
00:03:15,711 --> 00:03:20,213
Bite, chew, swallow, repeat.

52
00:03:20,215 --> 00:03:21,748
Who's Negan?

53
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,251
♪ Ding, dong ♪

54
00:03:24,253 --> 00:03:26,253
♪ Hell's bells. ♪

55
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:32,125
You see, usually
we introduce ourselves

56
00:03:32,127 --> 00:03:34,561
by just popping one of you
right off the bat.

57
00:03:34,563 --> 00:03:36,530
But you seem like
reasonable people.

58
00:03:36,532 --> 00:03:40,500
I mean, you're sportin' dress
blues, for Christ's sake.

59
00:03:40,502 --> 00:03:42,903
And, like I said, we're gonna
drive you back to where you were.

60
00:03:42,905 --> 00:03:44,905
I mean, do you know
how awkward it is

61
00:03:44,907 --> 00:03:47,774
carpooling with someone whose friend
or friends you've just killed?

62
00:03:47,776 --> 00:03:49,943
Oof.

63
00:03:49,945 --> 00:03:54,114
But I told you
not to ask any questions.

64
00:03:54,116 --> 00:03:56,216
And then what does
this ginger do?

65
00:03:58,153 --> 00:04:00,203
So that's that.

66
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:02,455
I don't want you to get
the wrong impression of me.

67
00:04:02,457 --> 00:04:04,207
Wait.

68
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,563
Wait.

69
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:12,933
<i>You don't have to do this.</i>

70
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,103
Shut up.

71
00:04:17,105 --> 00:04:20,273
I am talking to the man.

72
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:22,943
No, you're not.

73
00:04:33,488 --> 00:04:35,822
I'm not gonna kill you.

74
00:04:41,246 --> 00:04:44,331
Wait, wait.

75
00:04:46,335 --> 00:04:48,301
You know what?

76
00:04:48,303 --> 00:04:49,569
Yes, I am.

77
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,833
Son of a bitch
was tougher than he looked.

78
00:05:21,286 --> 00:05:24,371
- Did he cut you?
- A little.

79
00:05:26,575 --> 00:05:29,409
What a bunch of assholes.

80
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:31,845
Let's get you fixed up at home.

81
00:05:31,847 --> 00:05:33,546
Yes, ma'am.

82
00:05:42,257 --> 00:05:44,391
Nibble on that.

83
00:06:13,017 --> 00:06:23,226
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny

84
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,919
All right, new plan.

85
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,155
Flares from a few guns
aren't enough.

86
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:29,907
<i>Too many walkers,
too spread out.</i>

87
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,777
We're not going to the armory.

88
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,563
We need our vehicles
back at the quarry.

89
00:08:35,565 --> 00:08:38,249
All of us drive.
We'll need to round 'em up.

90
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,701
We leave, we come back.

91
00:08:42,705 --> 00:08:44,172
Okay.

92
00:08:47,043 --> 00:08:49,126
But Judith...

93
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:50,778
to the quarry and back, I...

94
00:08:57,253 --> 00:08:59,637
I'll take her.

95
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,189
Keep her safe in my church

96
00:09:01,191 --> 00:09:02,990
until you all lead
the walkers away.

97
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:08,529
Can you do this?

98
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,899
I'm supposed to.

99
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:13,267
I have to.

100
00:09:14,904 --> 00:09:17,071
I will.

101
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:19,774
All right.

102
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,378
Shh, shh, shh.

103
00:09:25,748 --> 00:09:29,217
Shh, shh, shh...

104
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,323
- Take Sam.
- No.

105
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,591
Yes, Sam, it'll be safer.

106
00:09:36,593 --> 00:09:37,925
I'm not leaving you.

107
00:09:37,927 --> 00:09:41,229
- Sam--
- Mom, I'm not.

108
00:09:41,231 --> 00:09:42,930
I can keep going.

109
00:09:42,932 --> 00:09:45,433
- Sam--
- I can keep going.

110
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,403
Please.

111
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,942
<i>Please.</i>

112
00:09:56,946 --> 00:09:58,779
Let's just go.

113
00:10:00,783 --> 00:10:02,550
Okay.

114
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:09,373
I'm going to keep her safe.

115
00:10:12,762 --> 00:10:14,128
Thank you.

116
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,720
Shh, shh, shh...

117
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:39,320
Hey.

118
00:10:39,322 --> 00:10:41,322
He's gonna make it.

119
00:10:41,324 --> 00:10:42,890
Okay?

120
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:46,077
I know it.

121
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,299
Sam.

122
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,533
We have to try.

123
00:11:25,535 --> 00:11:27,034
We cannot go out there.
There are too many of them.

124
00:11:27,036 --> 00:11:28,369
<i>Rosita, he's gonna kill her.</i>

125
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:29,704
We won't get to her.

126
00:11:29,706 --> 00:11:31,005
She needs us.

127
00:11:31,007 --> 00:11:32,506
We'll die.

128
00:11:32,508 --> 00:11:33,708
That is what will happen.

129
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,259
We have one gun,

130
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:38,429
and the streets are filled
with those things.

131
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,381
That man needs her.

132
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:43,050
Okay?
She's a doctor. He is sick.

133
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:45,269
And I think we've seen
that he knows how to survive.

134
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,356
But we need to make sure
that Carol and Morgan are okay

135
00:11:48,358 --> 00:11:49,857
and then we make a plan.

136
00:11:49,859 --> 00:11:51,359
We cannot just go.

137
00:11:52,595 --> 00:11:54,228
Okay.

138
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,863
<i>Oh, God.</i>

139
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:03,871
<i>Rosita, gonna need your gun.</i>

140
00:12:03,873 --> 00:12:05,573
Gonna do a sweep
of the brownstone.

141
00:12:05,575 --> 00:12:08,159
I want to see what other
surprises are in here.

142
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:09,910
Hey, he's waking up.

143
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:13,464
Easy.

144
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:21,589
Where is he?

145
00:12:23,893 --> 00:12:25,760
Where's Denise?

146
00:12:25,762 --> 00:12:28,696
He took her, didn't he?

147
00:12:35,571 --> 00:12:37,438
Let's get you up.

148
00:13:05,902 --> 00:13:08,502
Maybe when they searched this
place, they missed something.

149
00:13:08,504 --> 00:13:12,940
Depends if it was Aiden or Heath's
group who went through it.

150
00:13:14,277 --> 00:13:15,726
Easy.

151
00:13:21,617 --> 00:13:22,900
Look in the Bibles, too.

152
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,618
Could've hollowed out the pages.

153
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,620
Are you serious?

154
00:13:26,622 --> 00:13:28,489
<i>We have two bullets.</i>

155
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:30,458
People holed up in here--

156
00:13:32,495 --> 00:13:35,796
people hide guns, ammo.

157
00:13:35,798 --> 00:13:38,799
Maybe something to start a fire.

158
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:42,553
It's getting dark out soon.
Maybe we can distract them.

159
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,473
<i>We need sheets,
ropes, towels--</i>

160
00:13:45,475 --> 00:13:47,942
<i>anything Maggie can use
to climb down the other side.</i>

161
00:13:59,188 --> 00:14:01,272
How things turn.

162
00:14:02,992 --> 00:14:04,408
Enid.

163
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,363
When I wanted to run...

164
00:14:12,668 --> 00:14:16,287
you said, "That's
how you lose people...

165
00:14:20,376 --> 00:14:22,459
even after they're gone."

166
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:29,049
What the hell does that mean?

167
00:14:31,888 --> 00:14:34,054
People you love...

168
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,141
they made you who you are.

169
00:14:38,594 --> 00:14:41,328
<i>They're still part of you.</i>

170
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,831
<i>If you stop being you,</i>

171
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:47,101
<i>that last bit of them that's still
around inside, who you are...</i>

172
00:14:48,704 --> 00:14:50,738
<i>it's gone.</i>

173
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,075
Who are those people to you?

174
00:14:55,077 --> 00:14:57,411
My parents.

175
00:14:58,748 --> 00:15:00,414
A man named Dale.

176
00:15:01,884 --> 00:15:04,585
Maggie's father, Hershel.

177
00:15:04,587 --> 00:15:07,221
A woman named Andrea.
A man named Tyreese.

178
00:15:07,223 --> 00:15:09,390
Who are they to you?

179
00:15:15,798 --> 00:15:17,598
My parents.

180
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:22,937
Then they're still here...

181
00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:25,439
'cause you're still here.

182
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:35,366
When there's an opening, we'll
make a break for that tower.

183
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:36,617
Hmm?

184
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:38,419
No, I'll just slow you down.

185
00:15:38,421 --> 00:15:40,588
Denise.

186
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:44,375
Denise, you're here...

187
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:46,760
with me.

188
00:15:46,762 --> 00:15:48,545
I need you.

189
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,967
Maybe I want you to stay

190
00:15:52,969 --> 00:15:54,635
'cause I'm enjoying
your company so much.

191
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,225
I want you to stay put.

192
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:02,476
What?

193
00:16:02,478 --> 00:16:03,894
I wanted you to come back.

194
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,280
I can handle myself.
You said you wanted help.

195
00:16:06,282 --> 00:16:08,282
No, I didn't want you
to give up on this place,

196
00:16:08,284 --> 00:16:10,651
on these people, to be afraid.

197
00:16:10,653 --> 00:16:12,953
You were right.

198
00:16:15,491 --> 00:16:17,574
So I'm here now.

199
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:20,661
And I'm going out there
and I'm helping you.

200
00:16:22,331 --> 00:16:24,581
We have to get her
off that platform.

201
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,750
She's hurt.
She needs help getting over the wall.

202
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:30,254
I can climb up the gate.
You can distract them.

203
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,006
We do it together.

204
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,510
I'm just gonna follow you, anyway.

205
00:16:43,185 --> 00:16:46,353
<i>You keep looking
for the Bible Glock...</i>

206
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:51,692
<i>I'll make her something
to climb down.</i>

207
00:16:56,332 --> 00:16:57,698
Okay.

208
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:04,538
I like what you said before.

209
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,874
That I wasn't born this way.

210
00:17:08,678 --> 00:17:10,711
You're right.

211
00:17:10,713 --> 00:17:13,547
I changed.

212
00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:16,750
And now I want
to help you change.

213
00:17:24,393 --> 00:17:25,859
<i>Hey.</i>

214
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:28,696
You were right.

215
00:17:30,866 --> 00:17:33,734
Let's get Maggie.

216
00:17:33,736 --> 00:17:35,235
Can't you just stay here?

217
00:17:35,237 --> 00:17:37,071
Nope.

218
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,041
You've been given
a gift, Denise.

219
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:45,546
You'll see that one day.

220
00:17:46,582 --> 00:17:48,449
Or maybe you won't.

221
00:19:09,003 --> 00:19:11,337
<i>The monsters will come,</i>

222
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:14,172
<i>and you won't be able to run
away when they come for you.</i>

223
00:19:15,306 --> 00:19:17,105
<i>The ones out there.</i>

224
00:19:17,107 --> 00:19:19,942
<i>And they will tear you apart
and eat you up</i>

225
00:19:19,944 --> 00:19:22,144
<i>all while you're still alive.</i>

226
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:31,236
Sam?

227
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:32,487
Sam?

228
00:19:32,489 --> 00:19:34,907
Come on, come on.

229
00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:37,326
- Sweetheart? Sam?
<i>- You can do it.</i>

230
00:19:37,328 --> 00:19:38,660
- <i>You can do it.</i>
- Yes, you can.

231
00:19:38,662 --> 00:19:42,164
Sam.
Sam, come on.

232
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,833
- Come on, Sam.
<i>- Sam.</i>

233
00:19:44,835 --> 00:19:47,052
<i>- Sam?</i>
<i>- Sam...</i>

234
00:19:47,054 --> 00:19:48,503
<i>hey, you can do this.</i>

235
00:19:48,505 --> 00:19:50,372
Sam, just look at Mom.

236
00:19:50,374 --> 00:19:52,341
Honey, you can do it.

237
00:19:52,343 --> 00:19:54,509
Sam, you're gonna get--

238
00:19:54,511 --> 00:19:56,678
Sam, honey, I need you to come with me.

239
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,597
- Sam.
<i>- I need you to come with me.</i>

240
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:00,682
- I want to.
<i>- I need you to be strong.</i>

241
00:20:00,684 --> 00:20:02,267
<i> Sam--</i>

242
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:04,019
Mom!

243
00:20:26,343 --> 00:20:30,095
<i>- Jessie?</i>
<i>- Jessie. Jessie.</i>

244
00:20:30,097 --> 00:20:32,097
- No.
<i>- Jessie. Jessie.</i>

245
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:33,598
Come with us.

246
00:20:35,853 --> 00:20:37,853
Come on.
We have to go.

247
00:20:40,357 --> 00:20:41,857
No.

248
00:20:48,365 --> 00:20:50,232
No.

249
00:20:54,371 --> 00:20:56,004
No.

250
00:21:01,962 --> 00:21:04,012
Dad.

251
00:21:10,471 --> 00:21:11,970
Come on.

252
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:17,392
<i>Dad.</i>

253
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:40,882
You.

254
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:49,424
You.

255
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,360
Dad?

256
00:22:09,446 --> 00:22:11,613
Carl.

257
00:22:11,615 --> 00:22:13,448
No.

258
00:22:51,676 --> 00:22:56,312
Sooner or later,
we're fighting our way out.

259
00:22:59,317 --> 00:23:01,484
I know that you're
fully aware that we will.

260
00:23:01,486 --> 00:23:03,586
Yeah...

261
00:23:03,588 --> 00:23:05,154
we will.

262
00:23:06,557 --> 00:23:09,358
Not you.

263
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,861
- Well, by my reckoning--
- Eugene.

264
00:23:13,614 --> 00:23:16,532
Come on.

265
00:23:29,647 --> 00:23:31,630
They're moving
towards the gunfire.

266
00:23:34,385 --> 00:23:37,052
That shout.

267
00:23:37,054 --> 00:23:40,389
I suppose someone thought
they could put up a fight.

268
00:23:40,391 --> 00:23:42,141
I guess you all thought that.

269
00:23:42,143 --> 00:23:45,394
We did put up a fight.

270
00:23:45,396 --> 00:23:47,980
That's why
your friends are dead.

271
00:23:47,982 --> 00:23:50,866
Yeah.

272
00:23:50,868 --> 00:23:54,987
We should've waited
and watched a little longer.

273
00:23:54,989 --> 00:23:58,073
I was selfish.

274
00:23:58,075 --> 00:24:00,709
But maybe if I
wasn't so selfish,

275
00:24:00,711 --> 00:24:02,545
I wouldn't have got that IV.

276
00:24:08,085 --> 00:24:11,253
We're gonna find a gap and go.

277
00:24:11,255 --> 00:24:14,089
<i>Up that guard tower
and over the wall.</i>

278
00:24:17,395 --> 00:24:19,595
You don't need to be afraid.

279
00:24:22,433 --> 00:24:23,849
Go to hell.

280
00:24:23,851 --> 00:24:26,268
You need to know

281
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,521
it's safer out there
than it is in here.

282
00:24:28,523 --> 00:24:30,739
Start moving.

283
00:24:30,741 --> 00:24:32,441
Start moving.

284
00:24:38,249 --> 00:24:41,116
Now, straight up that guard post

285
00:24:41,118 --> 00:24:43,398
and do not stop.

286
00:24:43,636 --> 00:24:45,135
Go.

287
00:24:56,148 --> 00:24:58,482
Shit!

288
00:25:11,664 --> 00:25:14,164
Let's go.
Come with me, now.

289
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:17,801
You get me to the infirmary,
I save your life.

290
00:25:17,803 --> 00:25:19,503
I'll save your life.

291
00:26:10,189 --> 00:26:11,972
You had a child.

292
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:15,559
Right?

293
00:26:18,897 --> 00:26:20,564
<i>A husband?</i>

294
00:26:27,906 --> 00:26:30,957
I didn't want to hurt you,
I just had to stop you.

295
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:34,111
You saved him for you, not us.

296
00:26:36,482 --> 00:26:39,016
If it was for us,
you would've...

297
00:26:48,127 --> 00:26:51,361
I should've killed you.

298
00:26:51,363 --> 00:26:53,463
I should've.

299
00:27:02,408 --> 00:27:04,608
You can't.

300
00:27:18,957 --> 00:27:20,757
The infirmary's
right across the alley.

301
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:22,626
We need to get you there now.

302
00:27:25,464 --> 00:27:27,047
Hey!

303
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:29,933
The ladder was clear.
Could've made it.

304
00:27:29,935 --> 00:27:32,386
You turned back for me.

305
00:27:32,388 --> 00:27:35,522
Maybe it was because
you needed a doctor,

306
00:27:35,524 --> 00:27:37,641
or maybe you changed.

307
00:27:39,895 --> 00:27:41,144
You ready?

308
00:27:56,662 --> 00:27:58,128
Come on!
Come on!

309
00:27:59,832 --> 00:28:03,300
Go! Go!

310
00:28:03,302 --> 00:28:04,835
<i>Go!</i>

311
00:28:14,146 --> 00:28:15,812
Come on, come on.

312
00:28:15,814 --> 00:28:16,980
You okay?

313
00:28:16,982 --> 00:28:19,349
I'm fine.
How are my patients?

314
00:28:19,351 --> 00:28:21,435
They're doing well.
We moved them upstairs just in case.

315
00:28:21,437 --> 00:28:23,437
Oh, my God.

316
00:28:31,997 --> 00:28:33,663
It's the kid.

317
00:28:33,665 --> 00:28:35,198
Is he bit?

318
00:28:39,204 --> 00:28:40,837
Nope.

319
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:42,205
What?

320
00:28:42,207 --> 00:28:43,540
I need bandages.

321
00:28:43,542 --> 00:28:45,375
Top shelf, next to the sink.

322
00:28:45,377 --> 00:28:48,295
Two IVs from the fridge and all
the clean towels you can find.

323
00:28:48,297 --> 00:28:50,046
Aaron, grab the gurney.

324
00:28:58,524 --> 00:29:00,390
This is a gunshot?

325
00:29:00,392 --> 00:29:02,359
<i>Handgun. Close range.</i>

326
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:06,480
Please save him.

327
00:29:06,482 --> 00:29:08,031
<i>Please.</i>

328
00:29:10,736 --> 00:29:12,402
<i>That's gonna draw them here.</i>

329
00:29:12,404 --> 00:29:14,154
<i>I need light.</i>

330
00:29:14,156 --> 00:29:17,240
<i>Michonne, towel.
Hold it here.</i>

331
00:29:17,242 --> 00:29:19,409
<i>Okay, we need to keep
pressure on the wound.</i>

332
00:29:19,411 --> 00:29:22,379
<i>I'll go in and sew up
any lacerations.</i>

333
00:29:22,381 --> 00:29:23,914
<i>Just like that, right here.</i>

334
00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:26,500
<i>Now, Spencer, I need that pan.</i>

335
00:29:26,502 --> 00:29:28,585
<i>That one on the tray.
Good.</i>

336
00:29:28,587 --> 00:29:30,754
<i>I'm going to clean
and close this.</i>

337
00:29:30,756 --> 00:29:33,924
<i>Michonne, keep following me
with the towel.</i>

338
00:29:49,741 --> 00:29:51,775
<i>What-- what are you doing?</i>

339
00:29:51,777 --> 00:29:53,109
<i>Rick!</i>

340
00:29:55,163 --> 00:29:56,696
<i>Rick!</i>

341
00:30:20,106 --> 00:30:21,923
- Rick's out there.
- Hold on.

342
00:30:21,925 --> 00:30:23,357
- He needs my help.
- Just one more suture.

343
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:24,558
But he's out there.

344
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,228
This is his son.
Give me a second.

345
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,562
He's taking them all on.

346
00:30:28,564 --> 00:30:30,031
- We have to go get him.
- What?

347
00:30:30,033 --> 00:30:31,899
We have to.

348
00:30:31,901 --> 00:30:34,235
- This is it.
- Okay, got it.

349
00:31:29,592 --> 00:31:32,226
Knock 'em away.
Drive 'em down.

350
00:31:36,466 --> 00:31:40,101
We can beat 'em.
We can beat 'em!

351
00:31:47,944 --> 00:31:50,311
<i>Drive 'em back. That's it.</i>

352
00:31:50,313 --> 00:31:52,396
<i>We can do this together!</i>

353
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,286
Will you take her?

354
00:32:01,457 --> 00:32:02,656
Of course.

355
00:32:02,658 --> 00:32:04,992
Come with me.
Okay, okay.

356
00:32:04,994 --> 00:32:06,961
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

357
00:32:11,834 --> 00:32:13,334
Gabriel.

358
00:32:14,837 --> 00:32:17,004
What are you doing?

359
00:32:20,343 --> 00:32:23,761
We've been praying...
together.

360
00:32:25,181 --> 00:32:28,315
Praying that God
will save our town.

361
00:32:29,685 --> 00:32:32,520
Well, our prayers
have been answered.

362
00:32:32,522 --> 00:32:36,941
God will save Alexandria...

363
00:32:36,943 --> 00:32:40,161
because God has given us the
courage to save it ourselves.

364
00:32:50,206 --> 00:32:52,873
Guys, it's thinning
out there in front.

365
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:55,148
We need to get out there.
Rick's making a stand.

366
00:32:55,268 --> 00:32:56,225
<i> How's that?</i>

367
00:32:56,345 --> 00:32:59,046
He's out there fighting them
with Michonne and some others.

368
00:32:59,048 --> 00:33:00,981
It's time.

369
00:33:00,983 --> 00:33:03,384
Up the alley.
I'm going.

370
00:33:03,386 --> 00:33:05,302
Denise is safe.

371
00:33:05,304 --> 00:33:06,804
Did you see her?

372
00:33:06,806 --> 00:33:09,356
Yeah, she made it
to the infirmary.

373
00:33:09,358 --> 00:33:11,609
- I'm gonna go help Rick.
- I'm going, too.

374
00:33:11,611 --> 00:33:13,727
<i>- I'm with you.</i>
<i>- All right, me, too.</i>

375
00:33:13,729 --> 00:33:16,530
<i>- Right behind you.</i>
- Eugene, you don't have to.

376
00:33:16,532 --> 00:33:18,783
That's incorrect.
I do.

377
00:33:18,785 --> 00:33:20,951
No one gets to clock out today.

378
00:33:20,953 --> 00:33:24,738
And, hell, this is a story
people are gonna tell.

379
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:35,916
This way!
Come on!

380
00:33:46,262 --> 00:33:48,195
I'm sorry.

381
00:33:53,853 --> 00:33:55,352
No.

382
00:33:59,242 --> 00:34:01,192
Go get her!

383
00:34:01,194 --> 00:34:02,743
Go get her!

384
00:34:05,081 --> 00:34:07,281
Hey!

385
00:34:07,283 --> 00:34:09,283
Over here!

386
00:34:10,586 --> 00:34:11,785
Come on, here!

387
00:34:13,623 --> 00:34:15,122
- <i>Over here!</i>
- Glenn!

388
00:34:16,459 --> 00:34:19,960
<i>No! Glenn!</i>

389
00:34:19,962 --> 00:34:22,763
- Glenn!
- Come on! Over here, come on!

390
00:34:23,966 --> 00:34:25,799
Maggie!

391
00:34:25,801 --> 00:34:28,636
Enid!

392
00:34:28,638 --> 00:34:31,172
Over here!
Over here, come on.

393
00:34:35,945 --> 00:34:37,444
<i>Come on!</i>

394
00:34:37,446 --> 00:34:39,813
Just go!
Just get over!

395
00:34:39,815 --> 00:34:41,015
- <i>Go!</i>
- No!

396
00:34:41,017 --> 00:34:42,850
<i>Go!</i>

397
00:34:42,852 --> 00:34:44,485
Come on!

398
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:51,959
Shit.

399
00:34:54,497 --> 00:34:56,330
- No, Glenn!
- <i>Go!</i>

400
00:34:56,332 --> 00:34:57,831
Over here!

401
00:35:02,004 --> 00:35:04,004
<i>Glenn!</i>

402
00:35:04,006 --> 00:35:07,925
Glenn!

403
00:35:15,017 --> 00:35:16,267
Can you get the gate?

404
00:35:17,853 --> 00:35:20,237
Appreciate it, pal.

405
00:35:26,851 --> 00:35:28,719
Come on, we got you.

406
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,694
What the hell happened?

407
00:35:37,696 --> 00:35:40,147
I don't know.
I just got back.

408
00:35:40,149 --> 00:35:42,065
Listen...

409
00:35:42,067 --> 00:35:44,151
we can-- we can lead
some of them away,

410
00:35:44,153 --> 00:35:45,402
but they're scattered.

411
00:35:45,404 --> 00:35:46,904
No, we get 'em all together.

412
00:35:46,906 --> 00:35:48,572
Won't have to lead 'em away.

413
00:36:54,907 --> 00:36:57,441
Move it!
Back up!

414
00:37:01,397 --> 00:37:03,313
All right, that's it!

415
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,484
Don't let up!

416
00:39:55,788 --> 00:39:58,155
I was wrong.

417
00:40:00,793 --> 00:40:04,661
I thought after living behind
these walls for so long that...

418
00:40:07,966 --> 00:40:10,133
maybe they couldn't learn.

419
00:40:13,422 --> 00:40:16,339
But today...

420
00:40:16,341 --> 00:40:19,509
I saw what they could do,

421
00:40:19,511 --> 00:40:23,647
what<i> we</i> could do,

422
00:40:23,649 --> 00:40:26,099
if we work together.

423
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,854
We'll rebuild the walls.

424
00:40:33,025 --> 00:40:35,158
We'll expand the walls.

425
00:40:36,945 --> 00:40:39,830
There will be more.
There's gotta be more.

426
00:40:41,366 --> 00:40:44,084
Everything Deanna
was talking about...

427
00:40:46,538 --> 00:40:49,506
is possible.

428
00:40:49,508 --> 00:40:52,876
It's all possible.
I see that now.

429
00:40:59,134 --> 00:41:01,218
When I was out there...

430
00:41:03,689 --> 00:41:05,305
with them...

431
00:41:07,263 --> 00:41:09,359
when it was over...

432
00:41:12,231 --> 00:41:16,900
when I knew
we had this place again...

433
00:41:19,905 --> 00:41:21,404
I had this feeling.

434
00:41:27,286 --> 00:41:30,247
It took me a while

435
00:41:30,249 --> 00:41:33,917
to remember what it was...

436
00:41:33,919 --> 00:41:36,253
because I haven't felt it

437
00:41:36,255 --> 00:41:40,090
since before I woke up
in that hospital bed.

438
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:47,764
I want to show you the new world, Carl.

439
00:41:50,269 --> 00:41:54,437
I want to make it
a reality for you.

440
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:59,359
Please, Carl...

441
00:42:03,582 --> 00:42:05,081
let me show you.

442
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:09,586
Plea-- please, son,
don't die.

443
00:42:13,415 --> 00:42:37,558
