AMC's The Walking Dead</i>

2
00:00:03,558 --> 00:00:05,019
I know you're scared.

3
00:00:05,187 --> 00:00:07,021
The wall's going
to hold together.

4
00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:08,022
Can you?

5
00:00:09,191 --> 00:00:10,951
I don't get to
know what will happen.

6
00:00:11,027 --> 00:00:12,192
I have to live with that.

7
00:00:12,295 --> 00:00:14,194
<i>The others,</i>
<i>they're gonna be back.</i>

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,246
<i>They're gonna be back.</i>

9
00:00:15,364 --> 00:00:17,197
So you wanna just
leave her out there?

10
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:18,198
She's your friend.

11
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:19,250
My girlfriend.

12
00:00:19,368 --> 00:00:21,252
I mean 'cause she
was anyway, right?

13
00:00:24,423 --> 00:00:27,541
<i>You have to protect everyone...</i>

14
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:29,743
<i>...to create peace.</i>

15
00:00:36,017 --> 00:00:37,551
<i>Thank you.</i>

16
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:18,445
<i>Hey, heads up!</i>

17
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,450
Shit.
I said heads up.

18
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:28,322
Enid?

19
00:03:49,011 --> 00:03:50,711
Enid.

20
00:03:50,713 --> 00:03:52,880
What are you doing out here?

21
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,951
<i>There's another water
bottle in the corner.</i>

22
00:03:57,953 --> 00:03:59,453
<i>Take it and go.</i>

23
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,925
You're not gonna answer me?

24
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,428
<i>No.</i>

25
00:04:44,266 --> 00:04:46,433
What happened in Alexandria?

26
00:04:49,905 --> 00:04:52,406
We heard that sound.

27
00:04:52,408 --> 00:04:54,241
The gunfire.

28
00:04:58,113 --> 00:04:59,880
Enid.

29
00:05:01,784 --> 00:05:05,185
<i>What happened is
what always happens.</i>

30
00:05:05,187 --> 00:05:07,287
<i>People died.</i>

31
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:09,823
The herd broke
through the walls?

32
00:05:09,825 --> 00:05:11,058
<i>What herd?</i>

33
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,026
The walkers.

34
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:14,728
They broke out
of the quarry early.

35
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,030
We got on them, but that
sound, the air horn,

36
00:05:17,032 --> 00:05:18,866
what was that?

37
00:05:18,868 --> 00:05:21,585
<i>It was people.</i>

38
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,570
<i>You should go.</i>

39
00:05:29,044 --> 00:05:31,345
My wife,

40
00:05:31,347 --> 00:05:33,780
Maggie,

41
00:05:33,782 --> 00:05:35,682
she okay?

42
00:05:39,054 --> 00:05:41,188
Enid?

43
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,241
Is Maggie okay?

44
00:05:47,563 --> 00:05:49,329
Answer me!

45
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:54,735
Enid.

46
00:05:55,838 --> 00:05:57,387
Enid!

47
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,108
Enid.

48
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:17,010
Hey, Enid!

49
00:06:33,642 --> 00:06:35,342
Enid!

00:07:43,513 --> 00:07:45,530
Morgan.

52
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:51,019
Morning.

53
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:53,071
We haven't talked.
We should.

54
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:55,139
<i>A little later, okay?</i>

55
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,108
Okay.

56
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:46,024
You don't have to be
up here so much.

57
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,892
I won't be.

58
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,845
This is the direction
he'd come in.

59
00:08:52,762 --> 00:08:55,730
If he sends up a signal,
it'll be from out there.

60
00:08:55,732 --> 00:08:57,982
Yeah.

61
00:08:57,984 --> 00:08:59,734
Or it-- it won't be.

62
00:09:03,306 --> 00:09:05,857
When we go out there,

63
00:09:05,859 --> 00:09:08,409
it's never easy,
it's never simple.

64
00:09:08,411 --> 00:09:10,912
It's always a fight.

65
00:09:10,914 --> 00:09:13,981
But we've come back
from harder things.

66
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,317
From further away.

67
00:09:16,319 --> 00:09:20,455
Glenn, Daryl, Abraham, and
Sasha, they will, too.

68
00:09:25,729 --> 00:09:28,196
Maybe we don't wait
for them to be back.

69
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:32,967
We should start figuring out
how to draw the walkers away.

70
00:09:32,969 --> 00:09:35,603
We have some food and
water to last us a while

71
00:09:35,605 --> 00:09:37,872
and the walls are holding.

72
00:09:37,874 --> 00:09:39,440
We can take our time.

73
00:09:39,442 --> 00:09:42,293
Really think this through.
Do it right.

74
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:46,330
Clear it so they can--
they can walk right in.

75
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,055
I saw Judith in the house
the other day.

76
00:09:54,057 --> 00:09:55,757
She's starting to--

77
00:09:58,812 --> 00:10:00,495
she's starting
to look like Lori.

78
00:10:01,698 --> 00:10:04,399
- Yeah.
- Made me happy.

79
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:07,335
Me, too.

80
00:12:01,484 --> 00:12:03,518
Dad.

81
00:12:12,161 --> 00:12:15,213
Handguns will be a little
better for your first go.

82
00:12:15,215 --> 00:12:19,667
Magazine release.
Slide release.

83
00:12:19,669 --> 00:12:21,636
Thumb safety.

84
00:12:21,638 --> 00:12:23,170
That stuff's easy, right, Dad?

85
00:12:23,172 --> 00:12:26,908
Yeah.
Empty magazine.

86
00:12:29,178 --> 00:12:31,362
- Empty chamber. See it?
- Yeah.

87
00:12:33,266 --> 00:12:36,450
Someone's in front of you,
they have a gun.

88
00:12:36,452 --> 00:12:39,937
You're gonna be scared.
You will be.

89
00:12:39,939 --> 00:12:44,091
Your body's gonna tense,
you won't have time to think.

90
00:12:44,093 --> 00:12:47,111
You're just gonna want to pull the
trigger when you get it in front of you.

91
00:12:49,165 --> 00:12:51,465
But you'll miss

92
00:12:51,467 --> 00:12:54,035
and you'll be dead.

93
00:12:54,037 --> 00:12:55,920
You have to get it
up to your eye.

94
00:12:57,707 --> 00:13:00,291
You've got to be strong enough
to wait for your moment.

95
00:13:03,846 --> 00:13:05,980
Can I, uh...?

96
00:13:12,405 --> 00:13:16,190
Hey, your finger doesn't
touch the trigger

97
00:13:16,192 --> 00:13:18,225
until you're ready to shoot.

98
00:13:28,738 --> 00:13:30,671
Keep that one with you.

99
00:13:30,673 --> 00:13:33,341
Get a feel of what it's
like to carry one around.

100
00:13:33,343 --> 00:13:35,810
Can I shoot it?

101
00:13:35,812 --> 00:13:38,813
Maybe like down at the walkers?

102
00:13:38,815 --> 00:13:40,765
<i>No, with things how they are,</i>

103
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:42,550
<i>the walls are strong,</i>

104
00:13:42,552 --> 00:13:44,552
<i>but we're lucky the
walkers are spread out.</i>

105
00:13:44,554 --> 00:13:46,587
We don't want to pull
them all to one spot.

106
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:49,123
Well, what about, like, target
practice in the center of town?

107
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,926
'Cause then the sound will
spread out in each direction.

108
00:13:51,928 --> 00:13:54,368
<i>Or maybe we could use, like,
silencers or something like that.</i>

109
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,304
But, uh...

110
00:14:03,306 --> 00:14:06,641
I mean, we probably don't want
to waste bullets right now, huh?

111
00:14:11,714 --> 00:14:13,681
Just want to learn more.

112
00:14:15,051 --> 00:14:16,751
You will.

113
00:14:33,803 --> 00:14:36,137
Hey.
Sorry.

114
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:37,872
I was making--

115
00:14:39,726 --> 00:14:41,475
you want some oatmeal?

116
00:14:43,513 --> 00:14:46,080
Thank you.
I'm-- I'm okay.

117
00:14:46,082 --> 00:14:48,716
You were coming to the door.
What's up?

118
00:14:53,056 --> 00:14:55,056
Want me to take
a look at your arm?

119
00:14:55,058 --> 00:14:57,041
No, I'm not here for--

120
00:14:59,996 --> 00:15:02,029
I'm fine.

121
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,400
You can tell me if you're not.

122
00:15:13,526 --> 00:15:15,292
Morgan.

123
00:15:15,294 --> 00:15:17,111
<i>Can we talk now?</i>

124
00:15:17,113 --> 00:15:18,913
Uh-huh.

125
00:15:21,951 --> 00:15:24,652
What's going on?

126
00:15:24,654 --> 00:15:27,154
When I was coming back...

127
00:15:29,175 --> 00:15:32,510
I tried to cut off
the herd with the RV.

128
00:15:32,512 --> 00:15:35,312
Lead the walkers away.

129
00:15:35,314 --> 00:15:38,632
But five of those people with
the Ws in their foreheads,

130
00:15:38,634 --> 00:15:41,135
they stopped me.

131
00:15:41,137 --> 00:15:44,171
They tried to kill me,
shot up the RV.

132
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:50,177
Now, Carol says she saw you.

133
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:52,179
That you wouldn't
kill those people.

134
00:15:52,181 --> 00:15:54,515
Did you let any of them go?

135
00:15:56,586 --> 00:15:58,102
Yes, I did.

136
00:16:01,858 --> 00:16:04,592
I didn't want to kill five
people I didn't have to kill.

137
00:16:04,594 --> 00:16:05,776
They burned people alive.

138
00:16:05,778 --> 00:16:07,495
Yeah.

139
00:16:18,941 --> 00:16:21,342
Why didn't you kill me, Rick,

140
00:16:21,344 --> 00:16:23,577
back in King County?

141
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:26,163
Pulled a knife on you.
I stabbed you.

142
00:16:26,165 --> 00:16:28,082
So why didn't you kill me?

143
00:16:28,084 --> 00:16:29,917
Was it 'cause I saved you
after the hospital?

144
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,619
'Cause I knew who you were.

145
00:16:31,621 --> 00:16:34,655
Back there I would have killed
you as soon as look at you.

146
00:16:34,657 --> 00:16:36,824
And I tried.

147
00:16:36,826 --> 00:16:38,776
But you, you let me live

148
00:16:38,778 --> 00:16:41,579
and then I was there
to help Aaron and Daryl.

149
00:16:45,535 --> 00:16:48,035
See, if I--
if I wasn't there...

150
00:16:50,439 --> 00:16:52,373
if they died...

151
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,281
maybe those wolves wouldn't have
been able to come back here.

152
00:17:02,685 --> 00:17:05,019
I don't know
what's right anymore.

153
00:17:07,498 --> 00:17:10,090
'Cause I did want
to kill those men.

154
00:17:10,092 --> 00:17:12,760
I seen what they did,
what they keep doing.

155
00:17:14,297 --> 00:17:16,564
I knew I could end it.

156
00:17:20,837 --> 00:17:23,454
But I also know
that people can change.

157
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:29,376
'Cause everyone
sitting here has.

158
00:17:29,378 --> 00:17:32,479
All life is precious.

159
00:17:32,481 --> 00:17:34,815
And that idea--
that idea changed me.

160
00:17:34,817 --> 00:17:37,084
It brought me back
and it keeps me living.

161
00:17:37,086 --> 00:17:38,953
I just don't think
it can be that easy.

162
00:17:38,955 --> 00:17:40,721
- It's not easy.
- I wasn't saying--

163
00:17:40,723 --> 00:17:43,190
I-- I know.

164
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:46,026
And I've thought about
letting that idea go.

165
00:17:46,028 --> 00:17:48,362
But I don't want to.

166
00:17:48,364 --> 00:17:49,897
You may have to.

167
00:17:51,434 --> 00:17:54,802
Things aren't as simple
as four words.

168
00:17:54,804 --> 00:17:56,987
I don't think they ever were.

169
00:17:56,989 --> 00:17:59,340
Do you think
I don't belong here?

170
00:17:59,342 --> 00:18:02,593
Making it now,

171
00:18:02,595 --> 00:18:04,495
do you really think
you can do that

172
00:18:04,497 --> 00:18:06,513
without getting blood
on your hands?

173
00:18:12,121 --> 00:18:14,255
I don't know.

174
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,309
If we can somehow
get outside the walls,

175
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,795
get back to our cars
at the quarry,

176
00:18:55,797 --> 00:18:57,580
we could use them
to draw them away.

177
00:18:57,582 --> 00:18:59,882
We'll set up more watch points.

178
00:18:59,884 --> 00:19:01,734
Coordinate the shooting
of guns and flares

179
00:19:01,736 --> 00:19:04,653
so we could pull them out
in even directions.

180
00:19:04,655 --> 00:19:06,546
We'd need to get
all our people on it.

181
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:10,159
Carl, Tara, Rosita, Carol.

182
00:19:10,161 --> 00:19:12,128
What about everybody else?

183
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:15,031
Well, let's just keep
this to our own for now.

184
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:16,766
Really?

185
00:19:16,768 --> 00:19:20,770
Look, if we had the time to
bring the people along, sure.

186
00:19:20,772 --> 00:19:23,372
But we haven't had
a chance to catch our breath.

187
00:19:24,942 --> 00:19:26,876
Really?

188
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,947
We're in here together.

189
00:19:31,949 --> 00:19:34,116
We're catching
our breath right now.

190
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,787
Anything else is just excuses.

191
00:19:44,395 --> 00:19:46,662
Deanna.

192
00:19:46,664 --> 00:19:48,514
<i>Rick.</i>

193
00:19:48,516 --> 00:19:50,733
What's that?

194
00:19:50,735 --> 00:19:54,387
Plans for the expansion.

195
00:19:54,389 --> 00:19:57,022
We got a few other things
on our plate right now.

196
00:19:57,024 --> 00:19:59,942
I know.

197
00:19:59,944 --> 00:20:03,546
These are for what Alexandria
can be after this.

198
00:20:03,548 --> 00:20:05,197
Because one way or another,

199
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:07,633
there's gonna be an after this.

200
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:17,093
Now, when the blade connects,
don't jerk it right back.

201
00:20:17,095 --> 00:20:19,562
- You'll get stuck.
<i>- Stuck?</i>

202
00:20:19,564 --> 00:20:21,514
Like an ax cutting into a tree.

203
00:20:21,516 --> 00:20:23,199
It's easier to get a blade
into bone than out.

204
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:25,935
So what should we do?

205
00:20:25,937 --> 00:20:27,970
You should slide the machete
down through the wound.

206
00:20:27,972 --> 00:20:29,605
One fluid motion.

207
00:20:29,607 --> 00:20:32,291
Okay, you ease it through
the bone like this.

208
00:20:32,293 --> 00:20:34,894
<i>All right?</i>

209
00:20:44,055 --> 00:20:46,021
Hey!

210
00:20:46,023 --> 00:20:49,141
I'm a weapons novice holding
a significant blade here

211
00:20:49,143 --> 00:20:51,444
and there are people in my
proximity with open-toed shoes.

212
00:20:51,446 --> 00:20:54,130
That's right.
So get a grip.

213
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,871
What are you so scared of?

214
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,407
That would be dying.

215
00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:07,176
Dying is simple.

216
00:21:07,178 --> 00:21:10,229
It all just stops.
You're dead.

217
00:21:10,231 --> 00:21:12,882
The people around you dying,

218
00:21:12,884 --> 00:21:14,783
that's the hard part.

219
00:21:16,053 --> 00:21:17,670
Okay? 'Cause you keep living

220
00:21:17,672 --> 00:21:21,624
<i>knowing that they're gone</i>

221
00:21:21,626 --> 00:21:23,492
<i>and you're still here.</i>

222
00:21:25,229 --> 00:21:28,764
What you should
be scared of is living

223
00:21:28,766 --> 00:21:32,301
knowing that you didn't do everything
you could to keep them here.

224
00:21:35,406 --> 00:21:37,490
Too upset to keep going?

225
00:21:38,843 --> 00:21:40,509
Are the noises scaring you

226
00:21:40,511 --> 00:21:42,528
or can I get back to my lesson?

227
00:21:48,352 --> 00:21:49,952
Let's try this again.

228
00:22:24,755 --> 00:22:27,156
Shh!

229
00:22:27,158 --> 00:22:28,724
The hell are you doing?

230
00:22:28,726 --> 00:22:30,993
Shh.

231
00:22:30,995 --> 00:22:32,728
I'm taking you home.

232
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:34,730
I don't know you.

233
00:22:37,602 --> 00:22:39,301
Why did you give me water?

234
00:22:40,955 --> 00:22:42,855
I had it, you needed it.

235
00:22:42,857 --> 00:22:45,074
That doesn't make us friends.

236
00:22:45,076 --> 00:22:47,977
We're not friends.
I'm doing this for Maggie.

237
00:22:47,979 --> 00:22:49,645
Your wife?

238
00:22:49,647 --> 00:22:52,381
She wouldn't leave you behind.

239
00:22:52,383 --> 00:22:54,283
She wouldn't want me
to leave you behind.

240
00:22:54,285 --> 00:22:56,719
So we're going.

241
00:22:56,721 --> 00:22:58,587
I'm not friends
with your wife either.

242
00:22:58,589 --> 00:23:01,557
I'm not having
this conversation.

243
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,659
I'm not leaving you out here.

244
00:23:03,661 --> 00:23:05,110
We're going now.

245
00:23:05,112 --> 00:23:07,162
No.

246
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:26,268
Give me the gun, Enid.

247
00:23:28,405 --> 00:23:30,372
Turn around and walk away.

248
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,976
You're not gonna
pull the trigger.

249
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:37,179
I will if you make me.

250
00:23:41,151 --> 00:23:42,918
Let go.

251
00:23:44,955 --> 00:23:47,672
Asshole.

252
00:23:47,674 --> 00:23:49,791
You point a gun at me
and I'm the asshole?

253
00:23:54,498 --> 00:23:56,131
Let's go.

254
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:58,200
Out the back down the alley.

255
00:23:58,202 --> 00:23:59,885
We're taking the road.
We need visibility.

256
00:23:59,887 --> 00:24:02,637
<i>Why?</i>

257
00:24:02,639 --> 00:24:04,773
Because half the herd broke off

258
00:24:04,775 --> 00:24:06,508
and they're headed towards home.

259
00:24:07,961 --> 00:24:09,711
I guess you missed that.

260
00:24:12,015 --> 00:24:13,481
Lead the way.

261
00:24:59,896 --> 00:25:01,963
You look like
you could use some help.

262
00:25:07,137 --> 00:25:11,740
You know, I think we could build
up a brace on this thing.

263
00:25:33,664 --> 00:25:35,096
<i>What?</i>

264
00:25:40,103 --> 00:25:42,637
Think your wife wouldn't
have wanted me to kill it?

265
00:26:08,098 --> 00:26:10,265
We can use them
to distract them.

266
00:26:15,172 --> 00:26:17,355
There's a helium tank
in those shrubs.

267
00:26:18,475 --> 00:26:20,442
More balloons, more string.

268
00:26:40,397 --> 00:26:43,264
It don't mean anything
as long as we keep this up.

269
00:26:47,471 --> 00:26:50,739
You know, you scared the hell out
of people when we first saw you.

270
00:26:50,741 --> 00:26:52,407
I know.

271
00:26:55,862 --> 00:26:57,946
You scared the hell out of me.

272
00:26:57,948 --> 00:27:00,815
With that beard.

273
00:27:00,817 --> 00:27:02,784
The way you looked around

274
00:27:02,786 --> 00:27:06,020
like you were seeing
things we weren't...

275
00:27:06,022 --> 00:27:08,757
hiding around corners.

276
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:10,525
Turns out you were.

277
00:27:15,065 --> 00:27:19,067
Things moved slow here.

278
00:27:21,154 --> 00:27:24,606
And then things
just started moving fast.

279
00:27:24,608 --> 00:27:26,141
Too fast.

280
00:27:27,761 --> 00:27:30,178
But don't give up on us.

281
00:27:41,958 --> 00:27:43,825
Who did you stay with back home?

282
00:27:45,328 --> 00:27:47,295
It's not my home.

283
00:27:52,969 --> 00:27:55,303
I lived in Olivia's place.

284
00:27:56,573 --> 00:27:59,908
But I was on my own.

285
00:28:01,628 --> 00:28:03,778
Orphaned by walkers.

286
00:28:09,286 --> 00:28:11,619
Me, too.

287
00:28:11,621 --> 00:28:13,588
Probably.

288
00:28:16,092 --> 00:28:18,059
It's just what happens.

289
00:28:30,841 --> 00:28:32,574
I get that you're scared.

290
00:28:32,576 --> 00:28:34,742
I'm not scared.

291
00:28:34,744 --> 00:28:37,212
Yeah, you are.

292
00:28:37,214 --> 00:28:39,347
You don't want
to lose anything again,

293
00:28:39,349 --> 00:28:43,485
so you give up and you say,
"That's just what happens."

294
00:28:43,487 --> 00:28:46,754
- I don't need a lecture.
- <i> Yeah, I think you do.</i>

295
00:28:46,756 --> 00:28:49,757
You honor the dead by going on.

296
00:28:51,161 --> 00:28:53,027
Even when you're scared.

297
00:28:54,714 --> 00:28:57,298
You live because
they don't get to.

298
00:28:59,169 --> 00:29:01,436
You think your parents
wanted you

299
00:29:01,438 --> 00:29:03,471
waving around a gun
because you're afraid?

300
00:29:03,473 --> 00:29:05,206
We don't have to talk.

301
00:29:11,615 --> 00:29:13,448
We don't have to talk.

302
00:29:33,787 --> 00:29:35,803
Crap.

303
00:30:11,577 --> 00:30:13,002
My God.

304
00:30:31,184 --> 00:30:32,850
Stop.

305
00:30:34,237 --> 00:30:35,853
I said stop.

306
00:30:35,855 --> 00:30:37,905
What's the point?

307
00:30:42,829 --> 00:30:45,112
The world is trying to die.

308
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,084
We're supposed to just let it.

309
00:30:50,086 --> 00:30:52,537
No.

310
00:30:52,539 --> 00:30:54,789
You're wrong.

311
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:56,457
We're not supposed
to let the world die.

312
00:30:58,177 --> 00:31:01,262
And I sure as hell
am not gonna let you die.

313
00:31:01,264 --> 00:31:03,881
I'm sure your wife
will forgive you.

314
00:31:03,883 --> 00:31:05,633
It's not for her anymore.

315
00:31:07,971 --> 00:31:10,555
Look, the walls are still up.

316
00:31:10,557 --> 00:31:13,140
The houses are still up.

317
00:31:13,142 --> 00:31:15,226
We'll find out the rest.

318
00:31:16,563 --> 00:31:18,446
Okay?

319
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:30,491
What the hell?

320
00:31:40,136 --> 00:31:41,919
<i>Spencer.</i>

321
00:31:41,921 --> 00:31:45,006
Hey, Spencer, get back here!

322
00:31:47,343 --> 00:31:48,509
Tara.

323
00:31:52,515 --> 00:31:53,598
Spencer.

324
00:31:54,767 --> 00:31:56,767
Spencer, get back here now.

325
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:02,657
Spencer.
Spencer, move!

326
00:32:13,703 --> 00:32:15,753
<i>Go! Keep moving!</i>

327
00:32:15,755 --> 00:32:17,755
- <i> Hurry!</i>
- Eugene...

328
00:32:17,757 --> 00:32:19,840
have Maggie and Rosita fire their
guns out from their posts.

329
00:32:19,842 --> 00:32:21,926
- Why?
- Just do it!

330
00:32:21,928 --> 00:32:24,962
- Tara, I cannot in good conscience--
- Just do it!

331
00:32:32,689 --> 00:32:34,221
Spencer, come on!

332
00:33:12,595 --> 00:33:14,428
Grab on!

333
00:33:22,105 --> 00:33:26,524
Tara! You almost died
once for these people.

334
00:33:26,526 --> 00:33:27,858
What?

335
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,410
What the hell were you doing?

336
00:33:32,165 --> 00:33:34,949
Lost a damn shoe.
Crap.

337
00:33:36,619 --> 00:33:38,953
What was that?

338
00:33:38,955 --> 00:33:42,339
I was trying to help. I wanted
to get to a car, draw them away.

339
00:33:42,341 --> 00:33:45,760
You ever make a climb
like that before?

340
00:33:48,431 --> 00:33:51,432
You want to help? Don't make
us come running to save you.

341
00:33:51,434 --> 00:33:54,135
You got an idea, you come to me.

342
00:33:54,137 --> 00:33:56,971
Would you have listened to me?

343
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:10,932
Everything okay now?

344
00:34:10,934 --> 00:34:12,600
It's handled.

345
00:34:14,471 --> 00:34:16,604
Everything's fine.

346
00:34:28,137 --> 00:34:29,300
Cheat sheets.

347
00:34:34,024 --> 00:34:36,324
Yeah.

348
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:38,860
Probably doesn't
give you a lot of faith.

349
00:34:38,862 --> 00:34:41,145
I have faith.

350
00:34:41,147 --> 00:34:43,531
Well, you have to, right?

351
00:34:43,533 --> 00:34:46,000
You don't have to.
I choose to.

352
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:49,671
You should, too.

353
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:52,607
So are you gonna tell me
why you're here this time?

354
00:34:54,377 --> 00:34:57,829
How well is the community
stocked with antibiotics?

355
00:34:57,831 --> 00:35:00,682
We're good.

356
00:35:01,835 --> 00:35:04,185
I need to dress a wound,

357
00:35:04,187 --> 00:35:06,120
but I don't know
if it's infected.

358
00:35:06,122 --> 00:35:08,056
I don't want to waste
medicine if I don't have to.

359
00:35:08,058 --> 00:35:09,624
FWoPP'RS.

360
00:35:09,626 --> 00:35:12,660
Fever, warmth, pus,
pain, redness...

361
00:35:15,131 --> 00:35:17,832
um...

362
00:35:17,834 --> 00:35:19,968
Tell me what it is.

363
00:35:24,441 --> 00:35:25,773
Swelling.

364
00:35:29,763 --> 00:35:31,412
Let's take a look at your arm.

365
00:35:32,816 --> 00:35:34,782
I didn't come in this morning

366
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,751
because I didn't want to get
you involved in something

367
00:35:36,753 --> 00:35:39,854
that you may not want
to be involved in.

368
00:35:39,856 --> 00:35:41,956
<i>In a secret.</i>

369
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:48,012
It's not my wound.

370
00:36:43,386 --> 00:36:46,154
- Hi.
- Hey.

371
00:36:46,156 --> 00:36:47,972
I know you just took care
of Judith this morning,

372
00:36:47,974 --> 00:36:49,624
but they want some help
with the watch points

373
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:51,259
after that thing with Spencer.
Could you...?

374
00:36:51,261 --> 00:36:52,660
Oh, yeah, no problem.

375
00:36:52,662 --> 00:36:53,995
Unless you want me
to take your shift.

376
00:36:53,997 --> 00:36:55,329
No, I like being up there.

377
00:36:56,699 --> 00:36:58,166
Even with all them outside?

378
00:36:58,168 --> 00:37:01,602
You can see everything.
Even inside.

379
00:37:01,604 --> 00:37:03,971
Um, let me just lock these up.

380
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:05,406
- Can you give me a second?
- Mm-hmm.

381
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,974
- Do you want to come in?
- Yeah.

382
00:37:18,455 --> 00:37:20,188
<i>Carol?</i>

383
00:37:22,926 --> 00:37:24,425
Carol.

384
00:37:24,427 --> 00:37:26,861
What, Sam?

385
00:37:29,132 --> 00:37:31,165
Sam?

386
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:34,802
What happens if you
can't live with it?

387
00:37:34,804 --> 00:37:38,005
I told you, it eats you up.

388
00:37:38,007 --> 00:37:40,374
Can you come down here?
I can barely hear you.

389
00:37:42,395 --> 00:37:45,413
The people who came,

390
00:37:45,415 --> 00:37:47,415
were they the monsters?

391
00:37:49,652 --> 00:37:51,869
<i>Did my dad turn into one?</i>

392
00:37:51,871 --> 00:37:53,521
What?

393
00:37:53,523 --> 00:37:55,990
If you kill people,

394
00:37:55,992 --> 00:37:58,709
do you turn into
one of the monsters?

395
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:04,232
The only thing that keeps you from
becoming a monster is killing.

396
00:38:16,963 --> 00:38:19,931
- Thank you for this.
- Oh, yeah, no problem.

397
00:38:19,933 --> 00:38:22,617
Yeah.
Bye-bye.

398
00:38:32,395 --> 00:38:34,495
Who the hell do you
have in that cell?

399
00:39:21,744 --> 00:39:24,178
Hey, you seen Denise?

400
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,546
No.

401
00:39:31,654 --> 00:39:33,154
I'll be right back.

402
00:39:36,009 --> 00:39:38,059
Hey.

403
00:39:38,061 --> 00:39:40,461
Look, I'm sorry about before.

404
00:39:40,463 --> 00:39:43,164
- I was just--
- He was stupid. That we know.

405
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:46,884
I just meant what you did for
him, you didn't have to.

406
00:39:46,886 --> 00:39:49,103
I know.

407
00:39:49,105 --> 00:39:51,005
You could have died.

408
00:39:51,007 --> 00:39:53,507
I mean, I'd like to say
I was thinking about it,

409
00:39:53,509 --> 00:39:55,543
but I wasn't.

410
00:39:55,545 --> 00:39:57,878
Is that why you did it?

411
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,714
You weren't thinking about it?

412
00:40:02,051 --> 00:40:05,219
No, that's how it works with us.

413
00:40:05,221 --> 00:40:07,188
We're stuck with
each other, right?

414
00:40:08,725 --> 00:40:11,125
<i>Rick, you saved my son.</i>

415
00:40:11,127 --> 00:40:13,494
Thank you.

416
00:40:13,496 --> 00:40:15,563
Thank Tara.

417
00:40:15,565 --> 00:40:17,331
I already did.

418
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,570
Now I'm thanking you.

419
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:26,707
What Spencer did was stupid.

420
00:40:26,709 --> 00:40:28,843
I can't argue that.

421
00:40:28,845 --> 00:40:31,746
- At least he tried.
- That's not the point.

422
00:40:31,748 --> 00:40:34,015
I could have tried.

423
00:40:34,017 --> 00:40:36,000
There was a chance.

424
00:40:36,002 --> 00:40:38,019
How's that?

425
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:41,522
When the walkers were going
for him, it made a gap.

426
00:40:41,524 --> 00:40:44,025
I could have jumped down,
ran, made it out.

427
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:45,926
I could have got in a car,

428
00:40:45,928 --> 00:40:47,578
used it to lead
the walkers away.

429
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:50,665
I could have done that
and Spencer would be dead.

430
00:40:50,667 --> 00:40:53,301
But you didn't do that.

431
00:40:53,303 --> 00:40:55,119
Why?

432
00:40:56,773 --> 00:40:59,073
I helped save him
because he's your son.

433
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,194
Wrong answer.

434
00:41:46,906 --> 00:41:49,019
That's Glenn.
That's Glenn.

435
00:42:03,657 --> 00:42:09,820
