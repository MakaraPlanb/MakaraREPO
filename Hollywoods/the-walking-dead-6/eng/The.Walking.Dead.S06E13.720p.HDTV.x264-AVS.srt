<i>Previously on
AMC's "The Walking Dead..."</i>

2
00:00:03,497 --> 00:00:06,161
That's us, that's the Hilltop.

3
00:00:06,281 --> 00:00:07,597
As soon as the walls were built,

4
00:00:07,683 --> 00:00:08,765
the Saviors showed up.

5
00:00:08,851 --> 00:00:10,684
If we go kill Negan,
take out his boys,

6
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:12,152
will you hook us up?

7
00:00:17,993 --> 00:00:19,159
<i>What the hell
are you doing here?</i>

8
00:00:19,244 --> 00:00:20,244
What am I supposed to do?

9
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:22,162
You're supposed to
be someone else!

10
00:00:23,532 --> 00:00:24,431
<i>Lower your gun.</i>

11
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:26,533
<i>We've got a Carol and a Maggie.</i>

12
00:00:26,668 --> 00:00:30,027
<i>I'm thinking that's something
you want to chat about.</i>

13
00:00:33,459 --> 00:00:35,241
<i>They need our help.</i>

14
00:00:44,953 --> 00:00:47,320
You are staying here.

15
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:07,090
Damn it, Maggie, let's go!

16
00:01:07,843 --> 00:01:09,893
Not until it's done.

17
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,482
Stop! Or she's dead.

18
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:23,273
<i>Guns, knives on
the ground right now.</i>

19
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:27,243
Nice jacket.

20
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,601
For a murderous bitch.

21
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:32,001
<i>Well, we'll take it
off her before we shoot her.</i>

22
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,857
<i>It ain't on there right, I
can feel it. It ain't stopping.</i>

23
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,993
<i>I'm getting it tighter.
Jesus, give me a second.</i>

24
00:01:50,995 --> 00:01:52,828
<i>Son of a bitch, you're
cutting off my circulation.</i>

25
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,630
<i>Well, sport,
it's supposed to.</i>

26
00:01:54,632 --> 00:01:56,365
<i>Hell was that?</i>

27
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:04,106
<i>It's Primo.</i>

28
00:02:04,108 --> 00:02:06,525
Damn it, they've got him.
Give me the walkie.

29
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:09,278
Babe, what's happening?

30
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,383
Lower your gun, prick.

31
00:02:15,753 --> 00:02:19,087
<i>You, with the Colt Python.</i>

32
00:02:19,089 --> 00:02:21,890
<i>All of you, lower your
weapons right now.</i>

33
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:33,635
Come on out.
Let's talk.

34
00:02:33,637 --> 00:02:36,071
<i>How many we got?</i>

35
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,056
<i>Eight in sight.</i>

36
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:39,591
Too many.

37
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:41,927
No, we can take 'em.
We took more.

38
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:48,150
We're not coming out, but we will talk.

39
00:02:48,152 --> 00:02:50,319
Names.

40
00:02:50,321 --> 00:02:52,104
<i>Names!</i>

41
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:54,072
I'm Maggie, she's Carol.

42
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:56,525
<i>We've got a
Carol and a Maggie.</i>

43
00:02:56,527 --> 00:02:59,494
I'm thinking that's something
you want to chat about.

44
00:03:01,532 --> 00:03:04,116
Now, we're gonna work
this out right now,

45
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:06,918
and it's going to go our way.

46
00:03:14,745 --> 00:03:18,180
You can see we have
one of yours.

47
00:03:18,182 --> 00:03:19,798
We'll trade.

48
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,134
I'm listening.

49
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:24,386
<i>First I want
to talk to Maggie and Carol,</i>

50
00:03:24,388 --> 00:03:26,805
<i>make sure they're all right.</i>

51
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,490
I'm gonna put you on.
You say you're fine.

52
00:03:28,492 --> 00:03:30,359
I'll know if you try
anything else.

53
00:03:30,361 --> 00:03:32,944
Rick, it's Carol.

54
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,147
- I'm... I'm fine, but...
- Now you.

55
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:36,982
Rick, it's Maggie.
We're both okay.

56
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:38,867
- We'll figure thi...
- Shut up.

57
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:40,869
You have your proof.
Let's talk.

58
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:45,073
<i>All right.</i>
<i>This is the deal right here.</i>

59
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:49,411
<i>Let 'em go, you can have
your guy back and live.</i>

60
00:03:49,413 --> 00:03:52,214
Two for one,
that's not much of a trade.

61
00:03:52,216 --> 00:03:55,217
<i>You don't
have another choice</i>

62
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:57,502
<i>or you would've done
something about it already.</i>

63
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:01,590
We have to get him back.

64
00:04:01,592 --> 00:04:03,508
Primo can take care of himself.

65
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,594
He can patch me up.

66
00:04:05,596 --> 00:04:07,996
I need him,
thanks to that bitch.

67
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,767
<i>You lost your balls, Paula.</i>

68
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:13,985
<i>You should've shot her in the
head so they could hear her die.</i>

69
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,321
If you could just shut up,
I'll solve this.

70
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:17,489
Then make the deal or we go in.

71
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,524
She said shut up, so shut it.

72
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,076
You should be glad
she doesn't have

73
00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:23,612
a sack of gonads to trip over.

74
00:04:23,614 --> 00:04:26,081
<i>Look, I know you're talking it over.</i>

75
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,816
<i>It's a fair trade.</i>

76
00:04:27,818 --> 00:04:31,553
<i>Just come out, we do this,</i>

77
00:04:31,555 --> 00:04:33,722
<i>we all walk away.</i>

78
00:04:33,724 --> 00:04:36,041
Smug prick.

79
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:38,043
He must think we're stupid.

80
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:39,878
That's a good thing.

81
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,466
<i>Do we have a deal?</i>

82
00:04:44,468 --> 00:04:46,718
<i>I'll get back to you.</i>

00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,020
<i>Turn.</i>

86
00:05:49,762 --> 00:05:51,562

hell are you guys?</i>

<i>15 mi... on... way.</i>

93
00:06:16,836 --> 00:06:18,402
<i>We're headed
to the break point.</i>

94
00:06:18,404 --> 00:06:21,005
<i>Switch to Theta channel,
same code.</i>

95
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:23,274
<i>If I'm not there,
toggle to Alpha, listen in.</i>

96
00:06:23,276 --> 00:06:24,716
<i>Copy that.</i>

97
00:06:30,683 --> 00:06:33,251
<i>I hate this damn place.</i>

98
00:06:33,253 --> 00:06:35,419
<i>Safe house.</i>

99
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:37,221
<i>There ain't nothing safe
about it.</i>

100
00:06:37,223 --> 00:06:39,474
<i>This place is
gonna save our asses.</i>

101
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,274
<i>Get on the ground.</i>

102
00:06:56,276 --> 00:06:57,942
<i>You there.</i>

103
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,783
<i>You, over there.</i>

104
00:07:27,574 --> 00:07:30,308
You're wondering if there's
a way out of this.

105
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,394
There isn't.
Not unless I say so.

106
00:07:48,545 --> 00:07:51,329
<i>Paula, I need backup!</i>

107
00:07:55,218 --> 00:07:57,668
I want to kill you both
right now.

108
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,086
It's taking all I have not to,

109
00:07:59,088 --> 00:08:00,838
so go ahead, I dare you,
try something.

110
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,440
Just see what happens.

111
00:09:22,922 --> 00:09:24,755
When's the last time
anyone checked this place?

112
00:09:24,757 --> 00:09:26,757
<i>It was
fine a month ago.</i>

113
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:28,726
<i>Sweetie, that was a month ago.
Shit hards quick.</i>

114
00:09:28,728 --> 00:09:31,312
The guns have gone bye-bye,
the food's gone bye-bye,

115
00:09:31,314 --> 00:09:33,798
and we got growlers
up and down the halls.

116
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,816
<i>Means people can get through, too.</i>

117
00:09:35,818 --> 00:09:37,652
- <i>Maybe we should get gone.</i>
- Carol!

118
00:09:37,654 --> 00:09:39,020
<i>- Yeah? Where the hell to?</i>
- Nowhere.

119
00:09:39,022 --> 00:09:41,105
Got dead in the halls?
Free security.

120
00:09:41,107 --> 00:09:43,524
Those assholes get here
before our people,

121
00:09:43,526 --> 00:09:45,443
the cold bloods
will buy us some time.

122
00:09:45,445 --> 00:09:47,528
Shut up.

123
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,664
Jesus, it's bleeding. It's not
supposed to keep bleeding.

124
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,333
- Molly, give me the rope.
- I'm not losing it.

125
00:09:52,335 --> 00:09:54,952
<i>- I'm not.
- So you grind it out. Jesus, Donnie.</i>

126
00:09:54,954 --> 00:09:58,055
<i>Screw you, 'Chelle!
We have to get him back.</i>

127
00:09:58,057 --> 00:10:00,007
He can fix it.

128
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:02,126
- We have to, Paula.
- No.

129
00:10:02,128 --> 00:10:04,095
I saw them, you didn't.

130
00:10:04,097 --> 00:10:05,563
They took the place down,

131
00:10:05,565 --> 00:10:07,214
they got the guns,
they'll kill us, too.

132
00:10:07,216 --> 00:10:08,799
<i>Hey!</i>

133
00:10:08,801 --> 00:10:10,001
I'm not going down like that,

134
00:10:10,003 --> 00:10:11,719
not after making it this far.

135
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:15,690
<i>Hey!</i>

136
00:10:18,411 --> 00:10:20,528
What?

137
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,481
She's hyperventilating. Somebody
needs to take her gag off.

138
00:10:30,823 --> 00:10:33,824
She's a nervous
little bird, ain't she?

139
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,000
Look at you.

140
00:10:43,002 --> 00:10:45,086
Bitch, how did you
make it this far?

141
00:10:45,088 --> 00:10:50,007
Honey, you need to take some yoga
breaths and calm your ass down.

142
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:52,009
I can't...

143
00:11:05,358 --> 00:11:06,724
<i>Oh.</i>

144
00:11:07,706 --> 00:11:10,294
You're one of those.

145
00:11:25,128 --> 00:11:27,461
What are you so afraid of?

146
00:11:32,602 --> 00:11:35,302
Are you actually afraid to die?

147
00:11:38,608 --> 00:11:43,094
All this and you're scared
of getting your ticket punched.

148
00:11:46,482 --> 00:11:49,366
It doesn't matter
what happens to me.

149
00:11:51,571 --> 00:11:54,572
Just don't hurt Maggie.

150
00:11:54,574 --> 00:11:56,507
Don't hurt the baby.

151
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,420
Yeah, right.

152
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,008
She got a bun in the
oven, she doesn't look it.

153
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:16,760
I'm only two months, I think.

154
00:12:18,264 --> 00:12:19,930
You're some kind of stupid,

155
00:12:19,932 --> 00:12:22,183
getting knocked up
at a time like this.

156
00:12:22,185 --> 00:12:24,768
<i>You think that's funny?</i>

157
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:28,272
When was it ever smart
to get knocked up?

158
00:12:28,274 --> 00:12:31,492
Women used to just die
in childbirth.

159
00:12:31,494 --> 00:12:33,777
And they always thought
the world was gonna end.

160
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:36,780
<i>Living through it,
why would you just give up?</i>

161
00:12:36,782 --> 00:12:39,583
But are you gonna
live through it?

162
00:12:41,504 --> 00:12:44,205
Anyway, that's cute.

163
00:12:44,207 --> 00:12:46,707
Babies are the point.

164
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:49,059
Children are our future.

165
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,131
Making bite-size snacks
for the dead.

166
00:12:56,469 --> 00:12:59,019
The point is to stay standing.

167
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:00,304
<i>No.</i>

168
00:13:00,306 --> 00:13:04,058
Walkers do that.

169
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,477
I'm choosing something.

170
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,314
That's right.

171
00:13:10,316 --> 00:13:12,366
You are.

172
00:13:12,368 --> 00:13:14,351
You did.

173
00:13:37,176 --> 00:13:39,343
The baby.

174
00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:50,688
Honey, in case
you haven't noticed,

175
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:54,425
you've got bigger problems
than a little secondhand smoke.

176
00:13:56,429 --> 00:13:58,596
Molls.

177
00:14:05,037 --> 00:14:06,837
Y'all are worse than a bunch

178
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,708
of evangelical second graders.

179
00:14:22,555 --> 00:14:25,556
Those things'll kill you.

180
00:14:25,558 --> 00:14:27,725
They already have.

181
00:14:27,727 --> 00:14:31,478
I'm a dead woman walking.

182
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,983
Which puts us
in exactly the same boat.

183
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,629
Ah!

184
00:14:53,186 --> 00:14:55,203
My arm feels like it's on fire.

185
00:14:55,205 --> 00:14:58,022
You pull that off, you gonna
be nothing but a spigot.

186
00:14:58,024 --> 00:15:00,374
- Okay, hold on.
- Agh!

187
00:15:00,376 --> 00:15:04,011
Scout crew is coming. They're
30 minutes out, maybe less.

188
00:15:04,013 --> 00:15:06,631
<i>He doesn't have 30 minutes.</i>

189
00:15:06,633 --> 00:15:09,383
His nerves are dying.

190
00:15:09,385 --> 00:15:11,853
If he doesn't get medical help,
he's gonna lose his arm,

191
00:15:11,855 --> 00:15:15,139
maybe his life.

192
00:15:15,141 --> 00:15:18,392
I'm not a doctor, but my dad lost
his leg, and I know that much.

193
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:26,868
Your man, Primo,
you think he can help you?

194
00:15:29,989 --> 00:15:32,406
It's time to end this.

195
00:15:32,408 --> 00:15:34,542
<i>Talk to Rick.</i>

196
00:15:37,463 --> 00:15:39,330
30 minutes.

197
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:56,180
You know my problem?

198
00:16:01,487 --> 00:16:04,405
She did this to me.

199
00:16:04,407 --> 00:16:06,190
She did it and she's just
sitting there

200
00:16:06,192 --> 00:16:08,192
right as rain, fully intact.

201
00:16:08,194 --> 00:16:11,612
<i>- Hey.</i>
- No, you're not gonna make the trade.

202
00:16:11,614 --> 00:16:13,197
<i>And we just do 'em both now.</i>

203
00:16:15,868 --> 00:16:17,635
<i>No, we wait
for the others.</i>

204
00:16:17,637 --> 00:16:20,871
We have to be smart.
We need insurance.

205
00:16:20,873 --> 00:16:22,206
Then shoot her in the arm, too.

206
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,508
No.

207
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:28,512
You really gonna stick up for
some gutless bitch over me?

208
00:16:31,884 --> 00:16:35,303
- God damn it!
<i>- Shut up.</i>

209
00:16:35,305 --> 00:16:37,271
<i>Don't push me, Paula.</i>

210
00:16:37,273 --> 00:16:39,657
<i>Shut up!</i>

211
00:16:46,115 --> 00:16:47,481
Leave her alone!

212
00:16:50,603 --> 00:16:53,154
No! No!

213
00:16:54,907 --> 00:16:57,158
You dumb, uppity bitch!

214
00:17:11,257 --> 00:17:14,308
You really are
some kind of stupid.

215
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:19,814
Take her out.
See if she knows anything.

216
00:17:19,816 --> 00:17:22,183
Should've done that before.

217
00:17:28,174 --> 00:17:29,991
Move.

218
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,543
You got nice clothes,

219
00:17:49,545 --> 00:17:53,047
time to make babies.

220
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:55,466
You're holed up somewhere good.

221
00:17:56,469 --> 00:17:57,718
Tell me where.

222
00:18:15,655 --> 00:18:17,488
Don't draw this out, bitch.

223
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:21,075
Just tell me where.

224
00:18:21,077 --> 00:18:24,161
Help yourself
and the baby in your belly.

225
00:18:25,665 --> 00:18:29,333
The way you stay alive
is you produce for us.

226
00:18:33,756 --> 00:18:36,006
You're not the good guys.

227
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,427
You should know that.

228
00:18:42,598 --> 00:18:44,281
<i>He got you good, kid.</i>

229
00:18:44,283 --> 00:18:46,267
He's in pain.

230
00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:48,519
Guys can't handle pain.

231
00:18:51,774 --> 00:18:54,191
<i>Excuse me?</i>

232
00:18:56,729 --> 00:18:59,196
Just wanted to say thank you

233
00:18:59,198 --> 00:19:02,733
for helping Maggie,
for helping me.

234
00:19:05,571 --> 00:19:07,204
My husband Ed,
he used to...

235
00:19:07,206 --> 00:19:09,707
Yeah? I don't care
if your old man

236
00:19:09,709 --> 00:19:11,876
used to ring your bell.

237
00:19:11,878 --> 00:19:16,380
I see exactly
who you are, Carol.

238
00:19:18,184 --> 00:19:20,384
I know.

239
00:19:20,386 --> 00:19:22,219
You're pathetic.

240
00:19:22,221 --> 00:19:25,122
You wanna think
we're just the same?

241
00:19:25,124 --> 00:19:26,357
Go ahead.

242
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:28,826
You're wrong.

243
00:19:28,828 --> 00:19:32,129
He's just a warm body
for my bed.

244
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:35,833
That's it. I could
kill him in his sleep.

245
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,084
Do you really believe
in that crap?

246
00:20:00,193 --> 00:20:02,977
My faith got me through
the death of my daughter.

247
00:20:02,979 --> 00:20:04,995
<i>Hmm.</i>

248
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:08,165
Well, the good news is maybe
you'll see her again soon.

249
00:20:16,826 --> 00:20:18,492
<i>What happened?</i>

250
00:20:20,696 --> 00:20:23,113
I stole something.
Got caught.

251
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,951
What?

252
00:20:26,953 --> 00:20:30,187
<i>Gas, from this place.</i>

253
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:32,056
- Why?
- <i>To get a new car.</i>

254
00:20:32,058 --> 00:20:34,225
Look for my boyfriend's body.

255
00:20:36,696 --> 00:20:38,329
Did you find him?

256
00:20:38,331 --> 00:20:40,898
<i>He was blown up.</i>

257
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,234
<i>Not much to find.</i>

258
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,974
<i>"Frankie."</i>

259
00:20:49,976 --> 00:20:52,977
- Was that his name?
- Hell, no.

260
00:20:52,979 --> 00:20:56,730
I barely knew him.

261
00:20:56,732 --> 00:20:58,516
He was a dick.

262
00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:06,023
Frank was my dad.

263
00:21:08,761 --> 00:21:11,161
And that's what I was
gonna name the baby.

264
00:21:16,385 --> 00:21:19,220
- I'm sorry.
- No.

265
00:21:22,842 --> 00:21:25,175
You aren't.

266
00:21:25,177 --> 00:21:27,511
I'm not planning to die today.

267
00:21:27,513 --> 00:21:30,564
Yeah, me neither.

268
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:35,519
Thing is, one of us is wrong.

269
00:21:39,992 --> 00:21:42,693
Just tell me where.

270
00:21:55,786 --> 00:21:58,281
<i>Have you thought about it?</i>

271
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:00,406
<i>Talk to me.</i>

272
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:05,862
You weren't listening.

273
00:22:05,864 --> 00:22:08,364
I said I'd contact you.

274
00:22:08,366 --> 00:22:10,199
<i>Would it make a difference</i>

275
00:22:10,201 --> 00:22:12,368
<i>if I said I was sorry
about that?</i>

276
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,754
What do you think?

277
00:22:14,756 --> 00:22:17,924
<i>I think we're gonna make the trade,</i>

278
00:22:17,926 --> 00:22:19,542
<i>so tell me where.</i>

279
00:22:22,213 --> 00:22:24,430
We haven't agreed to that.

280
00:22:24,432 --> 00:22:27,600
<i>You will.</i>

281
00:22:27,602 --> 00:22:30,720
You know what?
I'm not so sure.

282
00:22:32,056 --> 00:22:34,440
We'd be taking most of the risk,

283
00:22:34,442 --> 00:22:37,226
not getting much
in the way of a reward.

284
00:22:37,228 --> 00:22:41,781
<i>The other option won't work out for you.</i>

285
00:22:45,069 --> 00:22:47,954
We'll take our chances.

286
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,748
You don't
have to do this.

287
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,082
You don't have to fight.

288
00:23:00,084 --> 00:23:03,419
Your people killed
all of my people.

289
00:23:03,421 --> 00:23:04,754
Of course we gotta fight.

290
00:23:04,756 --> 00:23:08,291
- We didn't want to.
- But you did.

291
00:23:08,293 --> 00:23:10,459
So tell me why.

292
00:23:13,147 --> 00:23:16,315
Your people ambushed
my people on the road,

293
00:23:16,317 --> 00:23:18,434
tried to take everything we had.

294
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,690
They were gonna kill them.

295
00:23:24,692 --> 00:23:27,493
Well, damn.

296
00:23:27,495 --> 00:23:30,863
So now we know what
happened to T's group.

297
00:23:32,033 --> 00:23:34,867
Those idiots.

298
00:23:34,869 --> 00:23:36,953
Probably put on a big show.

299
00:23:36,955 --> 00:23:41,374
Okay, fair play.

300
00:23:41,376 --> 00:23:43,960
You were just
defending yourselves.

301
00:23:46,547 --> 00:23:51,434
But, see, your people killed
them on the road, right?

302
00:23:51,436 --> 00:23:54,687
<i>Blew them to pieces.</i>

303
00:23:54,689 --> 00:23:56,889
<i>So, why not stop?</i>

304
00:24:01,729 --> 00:24:04,313
They said they were
working for Negan.

305
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:08,317
And what do you think
you know about Negan?

306
00:24:10,405 --> 00:24:12,538
He sounded like a maniac.

307
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,206
We were scared.
We had to stop him.

308
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:17,293
Sweetie, sweetie.

309
00:24:17,295 --> 00:24:19,996
We are all Negan.

310
00:24:23,051 --> 00:24:26,719
What do you mean?

311
00:24:29,424 --> 00:24:31,841
What does that mean?

312
00:24:53,614 --> 00:24:55,364
Can I have one?

313
00:24:56,534 --> 00:24:59,618
Well, look at you, little bird.

314
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,755
I didn't think you approved.

315
00:25:02,757 --> 00:25:04,924
I don't.

316
00:25:27,281 --> 00:25:29,648
You are weak.

317
00:25:30,818 --> 00:25:33,152
What are you so afraid of?

318
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,624
So scared, you can't even
stick to your own principles.

319
00:25:41,746 --> 00:25:44,964
You don't want me to stick
to my own principles.

320
00:25:54,392 --> 00:25:58,260
I was a secretary before.

321
00:26:01,933 --> 00:26:04,817
I fetched coffee for my boss

322
00:26:04,819 --> 00:26:07,653
and made him feel
good about himself.

323
00:26:07,655 --> 00:26:09,939
I spent most of my days reading

324
00:26:09,941 --> 00:26:12,525
stupid inspirational
e-mails

325
00:26:12,527 --> 00:26:15,161
to try and feel good
about myself.

326
00:26:15,163 --> 00:26:18,531
There was this one
that kept going around.

327
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:21,784
<i>A young woman
was having a hard time</i>

328
00:26:21,786 --> 00:26:24,670
<i>and told her mom
she wanted to give up,</i>

329
00:26:24,672 --> 00:26:26,505
so her mom went to the kitchen

330
00:26:26,507 --> 00:26:29,925
and started boiling
three pots of water.

331
00:26:29,927 --> 00:26:32,461
She put a carrot in one,
an egg in another,

332
00:26:32,463 --> 00:26:34,964
and ground coffee beans
in the last one.

333
00:26:36,467 --> 00:26:38,634
<i>After they had boiled
a while, her mom said,</i>

334
00:26:38,636 --> 00:26:42,221
<i>"Look, all three things went
through the same boiling water.</i>

335
00:26:42,223 --> 00:26:45,741
<i>The carrot went in strong
and came out soft.</i>

336
00:26:45,743 --> 00:26:48,978
<i>The egg was fragile
and came out hard.</i>

337
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:53,065
But the coffee beans
changed the water itself."

338
00:26:56,737 --> 00:26:59,488
You're supposed to want
to be the coffee beans.

339
00:27:02,827 --> 00:27:05,394
<i>See, to me, coffee
was just a thing</i>

340
00:27:05,396 --> 00:27:07,163
<i>that my boss would drink up.</i>

341
00:27:07,165 --> 00:27:09,231
<i>No matter how many times
I refilled his damn cup,</i>

342
00:27:09,233 --> 00:27:12,034
<i>it was just never enough.</i>

343
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,341
<i>I was at work when
the Army took over DC.</i>

344
00:27:20,678 --> 00:27:22,595
We weren't allowed to leave.

345
00:27:22,597 --> 00:27:26,215
They had to evacuate all the
important people first...

346
00:27:26,217 --> 00:27:30,102
members of Congress,
government employees.

347
00:27:30,104 --> 00:27:33,022
So I was stuck with my boss.

348
00:27:33,024 --> 00:27:35,441
Not my family...

349
00:27:35,443 --> 00:27:40,246
my husband, my four girls...

350
00:27:51,592 --> 00:27:54,109
My boss was weak and stupid
and he was going to die

351
00:27:54,111 --> 00:27:56,612
and he was going
to take me down, too.

352
00:27:56,614 --> 00:27:59,465
He was the first person I killed

353
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:01,483
so that I could live.

354
00:28:03,938 --> 00:28:06,055
I stopped counting
when I hit double digits.

355
00:28:06,057 --> 00:28:09,058
That's right around the time
I stopped feeling bad about it.

356
00:28:11,062 --> 00:28:13,279
I am not like you.

357
00:28:14,732 --> 00:28:18,284
I'm still me, but better.

358
00:28:18,286 --> 00:28:21,620
I lost everything
and it made me stronger.

359
00:28:21,622 --> 00:28:23,489
You sure about that?

360
00:28:23,491 --> 00:28:25,291
I'm alive.

361
00:28:25,293 --> 00:28:27,743
With those people,
those killers.

362
00:28:27,745 --> 00:28:29,745
<i>Your people are killers, Carol.</i>

363
00:28:29,747 --> 00:28:32,798
That makes you a killer.

364
00:28:45,763 --> 00:28:47,846
You... you're the one.

365
00:28:47,848 --> 00:28:49,798
Excuse me?

366
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,484
You're the one
who's afraid to die.

367
00:28:52,486 --> 00:28:55,271
And you're going to.

368
00:28:55,273 --> 00:28:58,774
You will die.

369
00:29:00,566 --> 00:29:03,329
It's what's gonna happen
if you don't work this out.

370
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,450
Are you going to kill me?

371
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:13,339
I hope not.

372
00:29:19,923 --> 00:29:24,693
Asshole, are you there?

373
00:29:24,695 --> 00:29:26,695
<i>I'm here.</i>

374
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,451
We've thought about it.
We want to make the trade.

375
00:29:32,453 --> 00:29:34,870
<i>That's good.</i>

376
00:29:34,872 --> 00:29:38,624
There's a large field with a
sign that says "God is dead"

377
00:29:38,626 --> 00:29:41,911
about two miles
down I-66.

378
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:44,630
Good visibility
in all directions.

379
00:29:44,632 --> 00:29:47,600
<i>We'll meet you there.
10 minutes?</i>

380
00:29:48,803 --> 00:29:50,219
10 minutes.

381
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:57,393
Mm-mm.
Now, that was too easy.

382
00:29:57,395 --> 00:30:00,062
Maybe they're just itching
to get their people back.

383
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:02,064
<i>No, there was no static.
There should've been static.</i>

384
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:04,116
<i>They're close.
They're probably already here.</i>

385
00:30:04,118 --> 00:30:05,818
<i>We were careful,
but there were tracks.</i>

386
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,403
- <i>There had to be.</i>
- No...

387
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:09,238
They killed everybody back home.
They have the weapons.

388
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,623
They know what they're doing.

389
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:12,458
They're probably
waiting to kill us

390
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,959
as soon as we walk
out those doors.

391
00:30:13,961 --> 00:30:16,245
- That's what we'd do.
- No.

392
00:30:18,966 --> 00:30:22,001
You have to listen
to me, please.

393
00:30:22,003 --> 00:30:24,837
Rick is a man of his word.

394
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:27,756
He wouldn't put me and
Maggie at risk to attack.

395
00:30:27,758 --> 00:30:30,926
Then he's just
as stupid as you are.

396
00:30:32,763 --> 00:30:34,980
What's your ETA?

397
00:30:34,982 --> 00:30:36,999
<i>A few minutes away,</i>

398
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,984
<i>- but the car is running on fumes.
- We have gas.</i>

399
00:30:38,986 --> 00:30:40,936
<i>We'll fill you up
and then we move.</i>

400
00:30:40,938 --> 00:30:43,155
<i>Radio when you're
back in the perimeter.</i>

401
00:30:43,157 --> 00:30:45,774
<i>Copy that.</i>

402
00:30:45,776 --> 00:30:47,860
We gotta get ready.

403
00:30:47,862 --> 00:30:51,030
Pull 'Chelle out so she
doesn't get stuck in a fight.

404
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:53,115
We have to be ready
to move at any second.

405
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:54,700
What about the girl?

406
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:57,886
Leave her for now.

407
00:30:57,888 --> 00:31:00,706
If we leave, we travel light.

408
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:04,059
And if the pricks are here,
we pick 'em off at the door.

409
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:16,705
<i>Molls, we need
this hall clear.</i>

410
00:31:57,014 --> 00:31:59,431
Just a sec, sugar.

411
00:32:28,312 --> 00:32:30,179
Are you okay?

412
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:32,581
I have to be.

413
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,550
They've spread out, but I think
we can make it past them.

414
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:37,219
- We have to try.
- We can't leave them alive.

415
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:38,804
No, we should just go.

416
00:32:38,806 --> 00:32:41,323
Carol, we have to finish this.
We have to.

417
00:33:28,022 --> 00:33:30,439
He was already dead.

418
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:33,992
- <i>He's turning.</i>
- We should go.

419
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,945
We need a gun.

420
00:33:38,532 --> 00:33:40,048
Give me that.

421
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:13,048
Eat shit and die, Donnie!

422
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:15,818
Where are ya, Magnolia?

423
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,237
I wanna bloody up
that nice...

424
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,991
Agh!

425
00:34:32,169 --> 00:34:33,836
Let's go.

426
00:35:17,591 --> 00:35:19,241
<i>They're using
them to keep us in,</i>

427
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:20,993
<i>keep the others out.</i>

428
00:35:23,602 --> 00:35:25,488
<i>Come on.</i>

429
00:35:25,608 --> 00:35:27,416
<i>We have to find 'em.</i>

430
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:43,098
Just run.

431
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,183
Shoot her.

432
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:49,688
Go on, do it.

433
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:53,625
You've killed Donnie,
you've killed Molly.

434
00:35:53,627 --> 00:35:56,695
<i>Your people have
destroyed my home.</i>

435
00:35:56,697 --> 00:35:58,580
- Get outta here.
- Carol.

436
00:35:58,582 --> 00:36:00,198
<i>You have no idea.</i>

437
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,619
The things I've done,

438
00:36:03,621 --> 00:36:05,587
what I've given up,

439
00:36:05,589 --> 00:36:08,624
<i>what I had to do.</i>

440
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:10,976
- Just run.
<i>- Carol, shoot her.</i>

441
00:36:10,978 --> 00:36:14,129
Go ahead. I've already
lost everything.

442
00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:20,719
<i>Paula?</i>

443
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:22,604
<i>Paula?</i>

444
00:36:24,475 --> 00:36:26,275
<i>Molly?</i>

445
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:39,955
You lying bitch!

446
00:36:58,142 --> 00:37:00,058
I'll do it.

447
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:07,432
You're good.

448
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:09,151
Nervous little bird.

449
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:13,322
You were her.

450
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:19,144
But not now, right?

451
00:37:21,365 --> 00:37:22,614
Me, too.

452
00:37:24,368 --> 00:37:27,619
I told you to run.

453
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:30,706
<i>If you could do all this,</i>

454
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:34,376
what were you
so afraid of, Carol?

455
00:37:46,573 --> 00:37:49,541
I was afraid of this.

456
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:20,722
<i>Paula, we're
approaching the perimeter.</i>

457
00:38:20,724 --> 00:38:22,374
<i>Are we a go?</i>

458
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,687
<i>Do you copy?</i>

459
00:38:43,747 --> 00:38:46,248
Meet us on the kill floor.

460
00:38:51,205 --> 00:38:55,207
I think I might have
killed 18 people.

461
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:56,708
20.

462
00:38:59,596 --> 00:39:02,047
I should've killed
Donnie, too, in the woods.

463
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:04,883
I had a clear shot.
I didn't miss.

464
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:11,306
None of this would've happened
if I had just killed him.

465
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:14,559
- Don't think about it.
- I can't stop.

466
00:39:15,863 --> 00:39:18,396
We're almost done.

467
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:37,132
<i>Careful. The floor's slick.</i>

468
00:39:37,134 --> 00:39:38,834
<i>You sure this is it?</i>

469
00:39:38,836 --> 00:39:41,002
<i>She said kill floor.</i>

470
00:39:43,474 --> 00:39:45,624
<i>Hey, this one's locked.</i>

471
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:52,347
What the hell?!
Agh!

472
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:07,672
Maggie.

473
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:09,057
You okay?

474
00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:11,393
We got your trail.

475
00:41:11,395 --> 00:41:14,062
- You start a fire?
- Yeah.

476
00:41:14,064 --> 00:41:16,514
Hey, you good?

477
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:18,266
No.

478
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:20,018
Come here.

479
00:41:21,772 --> 00:41:24,689
They're dead. They're all
dead, the ones that took us.

480
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:26,524
They're all dead.

481
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:28,910
Hey, are you okay?

482
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,697
I just...

483
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:34,766
I can't anymore.

484
00:41:35,769 --> 00:41:36,785
It's okay.

485
00:41:36,787 --> 00:41:39,287
Your friends are dead.

486
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:42,040
No one's coming for ya.

487
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:43,541
So you might as well talk.

488
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:46,628
Let him burn.

489
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:49,297
I'm gonna ask you
one last time...

490
00:41:50,384 --> 00:41:52,133
how'd you get the bike?

491
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:54,052
- We found it.
- Like hell you did.

492
00:41:54,054 --> 00:41:55,220
We found it.

493
00:41:55,222 --> 00:41:56,972
Was Negan in
that building last night

494
00:41:56,974 --> 00:41:58,723
or was he here?

495
00:42:04,448 --> 00:42:06,281
Both.

496
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:10,235
I'm Negan, shithead.

497
00:42:12,072 --> 00:42:14,739
There's a whole world of fun
that we can talk about,

498
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:15,940
so let's have a chat.

499
00:42:15,942 --> 00:42:17,222
I'm sorry it had
to come to this.
