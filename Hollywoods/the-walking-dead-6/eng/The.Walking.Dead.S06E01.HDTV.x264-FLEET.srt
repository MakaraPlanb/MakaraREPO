00:00:00,387 --> 00:00:03,562
Previously on
AMC's The Walking Dead...

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,323
What is this place?

3
00:00:05,458 --> 00:00:07,992
This is the start of
sustainability, community.

4
00:00:08,127 --> 00:00:10,461
Rick, his group...
they're dangerous.

5
00:00:11,631 --> 00:00:12,997
Noah died because of you.

6
00:00:13,132 --> 00:00:14,999
You tried to kill me.

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,340
Why?

8
00:00:22,475 --> 00:00:23,556
Cause all life is precious.

9
00:00:25,144 --> 00:00:26,344
Do it.

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,146
Rick?

11
00:00:37,824 --> 00:00:39,323
<i>Rick?</i>

12
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,728
<i>I know this sounds insane,</i>

13
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,130
<i>but this is an insane world.</i>

14
00:00:46,132 --> 00:00:49,467
<i>We have to come for them</i>
<i>before they come for us.</i>

15
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:52,403
<i>It's that simple.</i>

16
00:00:52,405 --> 00:00:55,423
This is where
it all starts tomorrow.

17
00:00:55,425 --> 00:00:57,925
Tobin gets in the truck,

18
00:00:57,927 --> 00:01:00,344
opens the exit and we're off.

19
00:01:00,346 --> 00:01:04,148
He hops out, catches up
with his team at red

20
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,517
staying on the west
side of the road.

21
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:08,102
Daryl gets on his bike--

22
00:01:08,104 --> 00:01:11,022
You see that?

23
00:01:29,876 --> 00:01:33,377
It's open!
We got to do this now!

24
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:34,929
<i>We're doing this now!</i>

25
00:01:34,931 --> 00:01:37,181
Tobin's group, get moving, go!

26
00:01:37,183 --> 00:01:39,717
- No, Rick, we're not ready.
- Sasha! Abraham!

27
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:41,636
Damn straight, we'll do it live.

28
00:01:41,638 --> 00:01:43,721
You meet Daryl at red. Let him
take them through the gauntlet.

29
00:01:43,723 --> 00:01:45,973
- Yeah, we meet at red.
<i>- Go!</i>

30
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,651
- Rick, I'll hit the tractor place.
- Okay, who else?

31
00:01:56,653 --> 00:01:58,202
We got to take them out
or they'll distract the horde.

32
00:01:58,204 --> 00:01:59,570
- I'm here, let me help.
- No.

33
00:01:59,572 --> 00:02:01,572
- I'm here!
- Do everything I say.

34
00:02:01,574 --> 00:02:04,075
- I will. - Rick, this was supposed
to be a dry run.

35
00:02:04,077 --> 00:02:07,078
<i>- Daryl, get ready.</i>
- They're coming.

36
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:11,882
Rick, we haven't even gone
through the whole plan.

37
00:02:11,884 --> 00:02:14,051
You want to go back, go back.
We're finishing this.

38
00:02:14,053 --> 00:02:16,887
Tobin, you hit it on my signal.

39
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:20,391
<i>They're heading for home.</i>
<i>We don't have a choice.</i>

40
00:02:20,393 --> 00:02:22,810
<i>Get ready to hit the flares.</i>

41
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,763
Now!

42
00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:46,867
<i>Tobin, hit the truck!</i>

43

44
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:11,765
You were wrong.

45
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,917
Ron.

46
00:05:25,728 --> 00:05:27,227
Thank you.

47
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:29,179
Of course.

48
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,350
Okay.

49
00:05:42,194 --> 00:05:44,077
Glenn.

50
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:46,113
Glenn, what happened?
Are you okay?

51
00:05:46,115 --> 00:05:47,581
I'm okay.

52
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,950
You guys look like shit.

53
00:05:52,755 --> 00:05:55,005
She's fine. She's fine.
She's okay.

54
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,759
Tara?

55
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:00,794
I'm okay.

56
00:06:00,796 --> 00:06:02,930
You just check on them.

57
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,183
- I'm okay.
- What happened?

58
00:06:06,185 --> 00:06:08,519
We were out there.

59
00:06:08,521 --> 00:06:11,471
The walkers and--
we're all right.

60
00:06:13,058 --> 00:06:15,359
Got winged by a ricochet.

61
00:06:17,363 --> 00:06:19,479
It's all right.

62
00:06:22,151 --> 00:06:24,151
Holy shit.

63
00:06:26,989 --> 00:06:29,289
Thank God...

64
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,208
nothing happened to your hair.

65
00:06:35,047 --> 00:06:37,631
Okay, Eugene's freaking me out.

66
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:40,417
Somebody want to send Noah
in here to protect me?

67
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:28,682
You were right.

68
00:07:29,802 --> 00:07:31,551
It wasn't over.

69
00:07:38,143 --> 00:07:40,227
We should talk more tomorrow.

70
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:45,198
Listen...

71
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,904
I don't take chances anymore.

72
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,574
And you shouldn't.

73
00:08:49,965 --> 00:08:52,299
<i>You all have your assignments.</i>

74
00:08:52,301 --> 00:08:54,434
<i>You know where to rendezvous.</i>

75
00:08:57,556 --> 00:08:59,222
<i>Daryl leads them out.</i>

76
00:08:59,224 --> 00:09:02,025
<i>Sasha and Abraham join him</i>
<i>at the bottom of the hill.</i>

77
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:07,698
<i>Glenn, you hit us</i>

78
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,150
<i>when you take care of the
walkers at the tractor place.</i>

79
00:09:10,152 --> 00:09:12,652
<i>That's the one thing</i>
<i>we gotta get ahead of.</i>

80
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:18,291
<i>Everybody keep your heads.</i>

81
00:09:18,293 --> 00:09:19,826
<i>Just keep up.</i>

82
00:09:46,188 --> 00:09:47,687
So, is he okay with it?

83
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:50,023
It was pretty much his idea.

84
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:52,025
He gets it.

85
00:09:52,027 --> 00:09:53,860
It's got a bed and a bath,

86
00:09:53,862 --> 00:09:56,663
but it's still a cage, you know?

87
00:09:56,665 --> 00:09:58,582
He gets it.

88
00:09:58,584 --> 00:10:01,501
He told me what happened
out there with the trucks.

89
00:10:02,871 --> 00:10:05,172
He tell you about
those guys he met?

90
00:10:05,174 --> 00:10:06,373
The Ws.

91
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,760
Like that walker we saw, yeah.

92
00:10:09,762 --> 00:10:12,629
We need more watch points.

93
00:10:12,631 --> 00:10:15,882
And I'm gonna tell Deanna we don't
need to go looking for people anymore.

94
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:22,722
You feel different about it?

95
00:10:24,193 --> 00:10:27,561
Yeah, I do.

96
00:10:28,897 --> 00:10:31,448
Well, people out there,

97
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,066
they got to take care
of themselves,

98
00:10:33,068 --> 00:10:34,868
just like us.

99
00:10:38,073 --> 00:10:40,574
I'm gonna get him out.

100
00:10:40,576 --> 00:10:43,126
Shouldn't leave him in there
any longer than we have to.

101
00:10:49,418 --> 00:10:51,084
You good?

102
00:10:51,086 --> 00:10:52,919
Yeah.

103
00:10:54,256 --> 00:10:55,422
I'm trying.

104
00:10:58,894 --> 00:11:01,761
<i>Listen, if you're still looking to go
buck wild with the breath impaired...</i>

105
00:11:01,763 --> 00:11:04,848
You already asked the question
and I already answered it.

106
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:10,604
If you were so worried, why the hell
did you get into the car with me?

107
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:24,417
Listen, doing something
as big as this...

108
00:11:26,371 --> 00:11:27,871
that's living.

109
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,759
There it is.

110
00:11:35,631 --> 00:11:38,181
<i>We're at red
at the bottom of the hill.</i>

111
00:11:38,183 --> 00:11:40,600
<i>All right,
here comes the parade.</i>

112
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:12,966
Where'd you learn that?

113
00:12:14,503 --> 00:12:16,836
A friend.

114
00:12:16,838 --> 00:12:18,972
Before or after?

115
00:12:21,677 --> 00:12:23,176
I ask, you answer.

116
00:12:23,178 --> 00:12:26,479
It's common courtesy, right?

117
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:31,935
It was after.

118
00:12:33,689 --> 00:12:36,489
After everything.

119
00:12:36,491 --> 00:12:39,025
Look, I'm sorry for this,
for having to do this.

120
00:12:39,027 --> 00:12:40,527
It's all right.

121
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:43,029
The way I look at it,

122
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:45,615
sometimes you're safer
when there's no way out.

123
00:12:49,421 --> 00:12:52,005
Got to get to know
each other again.

124
00:12:52,007 --> 00:12:55,125
For the first time...

125
00:12:55,127 --> 00:12:57,043
again.

126
00:13:04,353 --> 00:13:08,972
<i>Hey, it's us.</i>

127
00:13:08,974 --> 00:13:11,191
<i>We're back. You gonna
let us in or what?</i>

128
00:13:15,564 --> 00:13:18,782
I'm technically not authorized,
so I will not be doing so.

129
00:13:18,784 --> 00:13:21,201
- Who the hell are you?
- You first.

130
00:13:21,203 --> 00:13:23,536
I'm Heath.

131
00:13:23,538 --> 00:13:27,073
I live here. My team's been on
a run the last couple weeks.

132
00:13:33,081 --> 00:13:35,248
I'm Eugene.

133
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,751
Aaron brought myself and my group
here directly within that window,

134
00:13:37,753 --> 00:13:41,087
<i>so we haven't had the chance to meet and
I can't exactly confirm your residence.</i>

135
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:43,173
Open the gate.

136
00:13:43,175 --> 00:13:45,892
If I do, how do I know
you won't attempt to kill me?

137
00:13:45,894 --> 00:13:49,562
Okay, look, I'm not gonna kill you.

138
00:13:49,564 --> 00:13:51,064
But the longer you make me wait,

139
00:13:51,066 --> 00:13:53,266
the more you motivate me
to beat your ass, so...

140
00:13:57,939 --> 00:13:59,406
Thank you.

141
00:14:19,795 --> 00:14:22,512
So Deanna put you on gate duty?

142
00:14:22,514 --> 00:14:26,216
Oh, no, I'm not proper duty.
This is Holly's shift.

143
00:14:26,218 --> 00:14:27,717
I was just walking by.

144
00:14:27,719 --> 00:14:29,853
She asked if I could
relieve her for a few ticks.

145
00:14:29,855 --> 00:14:31,638
I said, "No, thank you"
and she ignored me,

146
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,189
which is obviously
what I should have done

147
00:14:33,191 --> 00:14:36,142
as it's been at least five
ticks and still no Holly.

148
00:14:39,648 --> 00:14:42,699
I'm Scott.
This is Annie.

149
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:44,651
Hi.
Good to meet you.

150
00:14:44,653 --> 00:14:46,403
How many of you are there?

151
00:14:46,405 --> 00:14:47,987
13.

152
00:14:47,989 --> 00:14:50,990
I mean, 12.

153
00:14:50,992 --> 00:14:52,792
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

154
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,329
I'll close up.

155
00:15:11,396 --> 00:15:13,763
Anything big happen
while we were gone?

156
00:15:13,765 --> 00:15:16,349
Well, we had a meeting
last night.

157
00:15:19,104 --> 00:15:22,572
Oh, yeah?
About what?

158
00:15:22,574 --> 00:15:24,491
You might want
to talk to Deanna.

159
00:15:24,493 --> 00:15:27,277
Get it from the horse.
Her mouth.

160
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,028
You know?

161
00:15:30,365 --> 00:15:33,083
Right.

162
00:15:33,085 --> 00:15:35,001
<i>Hey, it's good to see</i>
<i>someone like me.</i>

163
00:15:35,003 --> 00:15:37,704
I fully respect the hair game.

164
00:15:44,463 --> 00:15:47,714
- Who put up the wall?
- They did.

165
00:15:47,716 --> 00:15:49,849
There was a man, Reg.

166
00:15:49,851 --> 00:15:53,303
He drew up plans,
made it happen early on.

167
00:15:53,305 --> 00:15:54,804
A lot of people in here.

168
00:15:54,806 --> 00:15:57,390
They've been inside
from the start.

169
00:15:57,392 --> 00:16:00,894
They had food, energy,
not a whole lot of walkers.

170
00:16:00,896 --> 00:16:03,229
They just lived.

171
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:05,532
They haven't had to survive.

172
00:16:05,534 --> 00:16:07,867
They figured that out,
brought us in.

173
00:16:09,237 --> 00:16:10,987
Still might be too late.

174
00:16:10,989 --> 00:16:13,072
Too late how?

175
00:16:13,074 --> 00:16:15,542
For them to come around.

176
00:16:15,544 --> 00:16:17,911
We'll see.

177
00:16:17,913 --> 00:16:19,746
You'll have to talk to Deanna.

178
00:16:19,748 --> 00:16:21,831
She's the woman in charge.

179
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:24,250
She was married to Reg.

180
00:16:24,252 --> 00:16:25,969
Was?

181
00:16:27,472 --> 00:16:29,556
Yeah.

182
00:16:42,821 --> 00:16:44,938
What are you doing?

183
00:16:46,358 --> 00:16:48,441
We're--

184
00:16:48,443 --> 00:16:50,693
I wanted to help.

185
00:16:50,695 --> 00:16:52,695
We only need one.

186
00:16:54,249 --> 00:16:56,282
We have two men here.

187
00:16:56,284 --> 00:16:59,419
We're not gonna bury killers
inside these walls.

188
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:03,339
I understand how you feel.

189
00:17:03,341 --> 00:17:04,757
I do.

190
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:07,260
But it's not your decision.

191
00:17:08,263 --> 00:17:11,097
Tobin.

192
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,099
Rick's right.

193
00:17:20,141 --> 00:17:22,809
Take it away.

194
00:17:22,811 --> 00:17:25,395
Go west.

195
00:17:25,397 --> 00:17:27,313
Down Branton Road a few miles.

196
00:17:27,315 --> 00:17:30,366
<i>Just past the bridge.</i>

197
00:17:30,368 --> 00:17:32,652
<i>We don't go out that way.</i>

198
00:17:34,406 --> 00:17:36,456
Let the trees have him.

199
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:07,353
I shot him
because he killed Reg.

200
00:18:07,355 --> 00:18:09,439
That was it.
We didn't have a choice.

201
00:18:10,775 --> 00:18:12,909
You do have a cell.

202
00:18:14,195 --> 00:18:16,446
Not for killers.

203
00:18:18,917 --> 00:18:21,117
I'm a killer, Rick.

204
00:18:22,537 --> 00:18:25,038
I am, and you are, too.

205
00:18:33,882 --> 00:18:36,382
Glenn, you there yet?

206
00:18:36,384 --> 00:18:38,801
<i>Almost. We'll have it
handled before they get here.</i>

207
00:18:38,803 --> 00:18:40,219
<i>And we'll meet you at yellow.</i>

208
00:18:40,221 --> 00:18:42,555
Copy that.

209
00:18:48,196 --> 00:18:49,896
It'll hold.

210
00:18:49,898 --> 00:18:51,731
Well, that's good.

211
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:53,900
You know, considering
where we're standing.

212
00:19:00,492 --> 00:19:02,408
Michonne.

213
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,043
Yeah?

214
00:19:04,045 --> 00:19:06,746
Back when you were
in that place...

215
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,133
where I lived...

216
00:19:13,254 --> 00:19:15,755
did you take one
of my protein bars?

217
00:19:19,511 --> 00:19:21,394
No.

218
00:19:23,682 --> 00:19:26,482
See, I could have sworn there was
one more peanut butter left.

219
00:19:26,484 --> 00:19:30,069
That's how it is, isn't it?

220
00:19:30,071 --> 00:19:34,107
You always think there's one
more peanut butter left.

221
00:20:03,605 --> 00:20:05,388
Morgan.

222
00:20:10,362 --> 00:20:12,478
Maybe we just leave him here.

223
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,987
That's not who you are.

224
00:20:24,459 --> 00:20:26,125
I know.

225
00:20:27,328 --> 00:20:29,245
Hey.

226
00:20:36,171 --> 00:20:38,304
You don't.

227
00:21:03,198 --> 00:21:04,947
Morgan.

228
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:08,167
Morgan.

229
00:21:10,672 --> 00:21:12,505
Stop.

230
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,292
Did you hear that?

231
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,854
What are you doing
out here, Ron?

232
00:23:33,491 --> 00:23:36,158
I wanted to know
where my dad was buried.

233
00:23:59,684 --> 00:24:01,717
<i>This is how.</i>

234
00:24:04,973 --> 00:24:06,389
How what?

235
00:24:06,391 --> 00:24:10,860
How the community's still here.

236
00:24:10,862 --> 00:24:13,062
They've had walkers
at their walls,

237
00:24:13,064 --> 00:24:16,866
but a lot of them,
maybe most of them,

238
00:24:16,868 --> 00:24:19,035
they wound up here.

239
00:24:56,157 --> 00:24:58,074
Ron.

240
00:24:58,076 --> 00:25:00,776
- Ron.
- I'm going back.

241
00:25:00,778 --> 00:25:02,695
- Hey.
- <i>I'm fine.</i>

242
00:25:02,697 --> 00:25:04,664
You shouldn't be out here.

243
00:25:06,117 --> 00:25:08,334
I don't care what you think.

244
00:25:08,336 --> 00:25:10,786
It's not what I think,
it's what I know.

245
00:25:10,788 --> 00:25:13,122
You can't protect yourself.
I'll show you how,

246
00:25:13,124 --> 00:25:14,790
but right now you have
no idea what you're doing.

247
00:25:14,792 --> 00:25:18,761
And if you come out here,
you're gonna die.

248
00:25:18,763 --> 00:25:21,430
And it won't be quick
and it won't ever be over

249
00:25:21,432 --> 00:25:22,965
'cause you'll be one of them.

250
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:25,935
That's what's gonna happen.

251
00:25:25,937 --> 00:25:28,270
You're coming back with us now.

252
00:25:30,975 --> 00:25:32,942
Don't make it hard.

253
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:36,539
<i>Glenn, you have to hurry.</i>

254
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:39,258
<i>The noise could distract</i>
<i>the herd right off the road.</i>

255
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,010
- <i>Talk to me.</i>
<i>- We're here.</i>

256
00:26:49,771 --> 00:26:51,220
Sounds like a lot.

257
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:56,358
- We need it quiet.
- So what's the plan?

258
00:26:57,812 --> 00:27:00,780
Take 'em out a few at a time.

259
00:27:11,793 --> 00:27:13,576
Nicholas, you're at the door.

260
00:27:13,578 --> 00:27:15,795
All right.

261
00:27:15,797 --> 00:27:18,080
You let one or two out
and then you close it.

262
00:27:18,082 --> 00:27:20,583
You keep doing that. That's the trick.
That's how we control it.

263
00:27:20,585 --> 00:27:21,967
- Heath--
- Wait, what if he can't close it?

264
00:27:21,969 --> 00:27:23,252
- <i>I'll be able to.</i>
- Then we take them on.

265
00:27:23,254 --> 00:27:24,920
We take them on?

266
00:27:24,922 --> 00:27:27,173
If we get into trouble,
we go behind the building

267
00:27:27,175 --> 00:27:29,391
into the woods
and we draw them away.

268
00:27:29,393 --> 00:27:32,178
Hey, you've been out
on runs since he got here.

269
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,430
He knows what he's doing.

270
00:27:34,432 --> 00:27:36,899
Me and Aiden, we didn't.

271
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:42,071
This was supposed to be
a dress rehearsal.

272
00:27:42,073 --> 00:27:44,073
I'm supposed to be
delivering pizzas, man.

273
00:27:44,075 --> 00:27:46,742
Daryl's leading them this way

274
00:27:46,744 --> 00:27:48,277
and they're closing in.

275
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:50,162
That noise is gonna pull
the herd right off the road

276
00:27:50,164 --> 00:27:51,664
and then we have
serious trouble.

277
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:53,582
We have to do this.

278
00:27:53,584 --> 00:27:54,950
Yeah, okay.

279
00:27:54,952 --> 00:27:56,168
- Okay?
- Okay.

280
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:57,870
- Okay.
- Okay.

281
00:27:57,872 --> 00:28:00,122
All right.

282
00:28:00,124 --> 00:28:03,342
On three. Ready?

283
00:28:05,213 --> 00:28:06,295
One...

284
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:09,048
two...

285
00:28:10,551 --> 00:28:12,351
three!

286
00:28:16,057 --> 00:28:17,690
Shit!

287
00:28:30,258 --> 00:28:32,059
<i>My team...</i>

288
00:28:32,061 --> 00:28:33,511
<i>we saw it early on,</i>

289
00:28:33,513 --> 00:28:36,931
back when we were on
one of those first scouts,

290
00:28:36,933 --> 00:28:38,983
finding out
what was around here.

291
00:28:38,985 --> 00:28:41,602
There was a camp at the bottom.

292
00:28:41,604 --> 00:28:45,356
The people, they must have blocked
the exits with one of those trucks

293
00:28:45,358 --> 00:28:48,025
back when everything
started to go bad.

294
00:28:48,027 --> 00:28:49,944
They didn't make it.
They were all roamers.

295
00:28:49,946 --> 00:28:51,495
Maybe a dozen of them.

296
00:28:51,497 --> 00:28:54,281
No one's been back since?

297
00:28:54,283 --> 00:28:57,117
DC,

298
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:00,287
every town worth scavenging are
all in the other direction.

299
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:03,624
<i>And I never really felt like having a
picnic next to the camp that ate itself.</i>

300
00:29:03,626 --> 00:29:06,460
So all the while the walkers
have been drawn by the sound

301
00:29:06,462 --> 00:29:08,796
and they're making more sound
and they're drawing more in.

302
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:11,048
And here we are.

303
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:17,271
Now what I'm proposing,
I know it sounds risky,

304
00:29:17,273 --> 00:29:20,224
but walkers are already
slipping through the exits.

305
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:22,860
One of the trucks
keeping the walkers in

306
00:29:22,862 --> 00:29:24,728
could go off the edge
any day now.

307
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,231
Maybe after one more hard rain.

308
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:29,900
<i>That exit sends them east.</i>

309
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:33,070
<i>All of them.</i>
<i>Right at us.</i>

310
00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:40,494
This isn't about if
it gives, it's when.

311
00:29:40,496 --> 00:29:42,162
It's gonna happen.

312
00:29:42,164 --> 00:29:44,331
That's why we have
to do this soon.

313
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:47,501
This is-- I don't even
have another word for it.

314
00:29:47,503 --> 00:29:50,004
This is terrifying.

315
00:29:50,006 --> 00:29:52,640
All of it.

316
00:29:52,642 --> 00:29:55,476
But it doesn't sound like
there's any other way.

317
00:29:56,562 --> 00:29:58,812
Maybe there is.

318
00:30:00,266 --> 00:30:04,235
I mean, couldn't we just
build up the weak spots?

319
00:30:04,237 --> 00:30:06,353
I could draw up plans.

320
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:08,489
I worked on the wall with Reg.

321
00:30:08,491 --> 00:30:10,824
<i>Construction crew--</i>

322
00:30:10,826 --> 00:30:12,526
<i>we can try and make it safe.</i>

323
00:30:12,528 --> 00:30:14,828
Even if we could,
the sound of those walkers

324
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,197
is drawing more
and more every day.

325
00:30:17,199 --> 00:30:20,167
Building up the exits
won't change that.

326
00:30:20,169 --> 00:30:22,036
<i>We're gonna do what Rick says,</i>

327
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:24,088
the plan he's laid out.

328
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:31,679
I told you all, we're gonna
have Daryl leading them away.

329
00:30:31,681 --> 00:30:33,464
<i>Me, too.</i>

330
00:30:35,017 --> 00:30:37,217
I'll take a car,
ride next to him.

331
00:30:37,219 --> 00:30:39,553
Can't just be him.

332
00:30:39,555 --> 00:30:42,723
I'll keep 'em coming, Daryl
keeps 'em from getting sloppy.

333
00:30:42,725 --> 00:30:45,392
I'll go with her.

334
00:30:45,394 --> 00:30:48,395
It's a long way
to white-knuckle it solo.

335
00:30:50,116 --> 00:30:52,199
We'll have two teams.

336
00:30:52,201 --> 00:30:55,786
One on each side of the forest
helping manage this thing.

337
00:30:55,788 --> 00:30:58,822
We're gonna have a few
people on watch from now on.

338
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:00,874
Rosita, Spencer, and Holly.

339
00:31:00,876 --> 00:31:03,794
So they're out.

340
00:31:03,796 --> 00:31:05,829
So who's in?

341
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,550
Me.

342
00:31:09,552 --> 00:31:11,335
You should keep an eye on her.

343
00:31:11,337 --> 00:31:14,088
Keep going with the plans
you talked about.

344
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:15,723
<i>I know, but this is important.</i>

345
00:31:15,725 --> 00:31:18,225
She's important.

346
00:31:18,227 --> 00:31:20,394
People are scared.

347
00:31:20,396 --> 00:31:22,563
They need to see her come back.

348
00:31:25,768 --> 00:31:27,901
That's not the only reason.

349
00:31:29,105 --> 00:31:31,855
Yeah, it isn't.

350
00:31:32,825 --> 00:31:34,658
Okay.

351
00:31:35,695 --> 00:31:36,994
I'm in.

352
00:31:38,664 --> 00:31:40,197
I'd like to help as well.

353
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:42,116
No.
Who else?

354
00:31:42,118 --> 00:31:43,951
We need more.

355
00:31:43,953 --> 00:31:46,286
<i>There's got to be another play.</i>

356
00:31:46,288 --> 00:31:49,873
We can't just control that many.

357
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:52,626
I said it before,
walkers herd up.

358
00:31:52,628 --> 00:31:54,511
They'll follow a path
if something's drawing them.

359
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:56,463
That's how we can
get 'em all at once.

360
00:31:56,465 --> 00:31:59,800
So, what? We're supposed to
just take your word for it?

361
00:31:59,802 --> 00:32:03,470
We're all supposed to just fall
in line behind you after...

362
00:32:07,977 --> 00:32:09,977
After what?

363
00:32:09,979 --> 00:32:12,279
After you wave a gun around

364
00:32:12,281 --> 00:32:14,615
screaming,
pointing it at people.

365
00:32:14,617 --> 00:32:16,817
<i>After you shoot</i>
<i>a man in the face.</i>

366
00:32:16,819 --> 00:32:19,787
- <i>After you--</i>
- Enough!

367
00:32:26,796 --> 00:32:29,713
I'll do it.

368
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:31,415
Me, too.

369
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:34,251
Whatever you need, I'm in.

370
00:32:34,253 --> 00:32:36,553
<i>Now who else?</i>

371
00:32:43,763 --> 00:32:45,229
I'll go.

372
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:50,434
We have to do this.
I need to help.

373
00:32:57,026 --> 00:32:58,942
You sure you can handle it?

374
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:02,329
You need people.

375
00:33:08,003 --> 00:33:11,455
We'll make this work.
We'll keep this place safe.

376
00:33:11,457 --> 00:33:13,874
Keep our families safe.
We will.

377
00:33:13,876 --> 00:33:17,377
The plan.
Go through it again.

378
00:33:17,379 --> 00:33:18,712
Man, he just said it.

379
00:33:18,714 --> 00:33:22,382
Every part again.

380
00:33:22,384 --> 00:33:24,968
The exact plan.

381
00:33:58,461 --> 00:34:00,296
Marshall and Redding.

382
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:03,382
- We force them west here.
<i>- How?</i>

383
00:34:03,384 --> 00:34:05,884
We block it off so they
can only go one way,

384
00:34:05,886 --> 00:34:08,220
west, away from the community.

385
00:34:08,222 --> 00:34:09,838
<i>Block it off with what?</i>

386
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,390
<i>Cars.</i>

387
00:34:11,392 --> 00:34:13,676
We'll use the RVs,
some of the bigger trucks,

388
00:34:13,678 --> 00:34:15,094
<i>park them end to end.</i>

389
00:34:15,096 --> 00:34:17,146
We'll be drawing them away.

390
00:34:17,148 --> 00:34:20,182
- They're gonna keep moving.
<i>- Yeah, but that many?</i>

391
00:34:20,184 --> 00:34:23,652
Just bouncing off some sedans?

392
00:34:23,654 --> 00:34:26,989
And then when they start
slipping through

393
00:34:26,991 --> 00:34:29,491
and the ones that walk away
start distracting the rest

394
00:34:29,493 --> 00:34:32,077
and you stop drawing them away?

395
00:34:34,198 --> 00:34:35,698
Man's got a point.

396
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,083
<i>We got plates.</i>

397
00:34:38,085 --> 00:34:40,753
The big-ass metal ones
from the construction site.

398
00:34:40,755 --> 00:34:42,538
We can use them
to fortify the whip wall.

399
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,123
It'd help disperse
the force of impact

400
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:45,874
and direct the walkers clean.

401
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:47,876
Like a pool table.
Eight ball, corner pocket.

402
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:49,762
That's an army out there.

403
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:54,433
And what happens
when this doesn't hold?

404
00:34:54,435 --> 00:34:56,935
And they push on through.
The curve in this hillside

405
00:34:56,937 --> 00:34:59,104
is gonna send them
right back east.

406
00:34:59,106 --> 00:35:01,724
Right back here.

407
00:35:01,726 --> 00:35:04,360
You seriously want to risk that?

408
00:35:04,362 --> 00:35:07,062
No.

409
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:10,316
So you need to help us
to make it hold.

410
00:35:11,702 --> 00:35:14,069
These walls, you built them.

411
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:16,789
So you've already
done the impossible.

412
00:35:18,459 --> 00:35:19,958
Carter.

413
00:35:21,045 --> 00:35:22,795
Please.

414
00:37:38,716 --> 00:37:42,134
Hey, what you said before about us
needing to take care of ourselves?

415
00:37:43,637 --> 00:37:45,854
Going out finding more people,

416
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:48,056
that is taking care
of ourselves.

417
00:37:52,279 --> 00:37:54,229
Your call, though.

418
00:38:01,906 --> 00:38:03,539
Thanks.

419
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:06,542
You know, I can come
with all of you.

420
00:38:08,629 --> 00:38:10,996
You and Daryl have been
teaching me how to shoot.

421
00:38:10,998 --> 00:38:13,966
I think you got the hang of it.

422
00:38:18,756 --> 00:38:21,640
<i>You should stay back,</i>

423
00:38:21,642 --> 00:38:24,760
<i>get a feel for how</i>
<i>people feel now.</i>

424
00:38:24,762 --> 00:38:27,229
<i>We still got a long way</i>
<i>to go with them.</i>

425
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:31,233
We'll get there.

426
00:38:31,235 --> 00:38:33,685
She's in charge.

427
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:35,904
But you're in charge now.

428
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,037
- This is a bad idea.
- This is the only idea.

429
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:54,039
I think there's something
like a dozen in there.

430
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:57,092
We stay back, we get on opposite
ends, we draw them to each of us.

431
00:38:57,094 --> 00:38:58,710
- Try and take down four each?
- No.

432
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:00,379
This is just me and Heath.

433
00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:02,464
You get back and you stay back.

434
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:04,850
Things go south, you tell
Rick and you draw them away.

435
00:39:06,186 --> 00:39:08,220
Just move back.

436
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:20,232
He got Noah killed?

437
00:39:20,234 --> 00:39:21,984
He did.

438
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:25,153
He did more than that.

439
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:30,075
He lured Glenn into the woods
and tried to kill him.

440
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:32,294
What the hell?

441
00:39:32,296 --> 00:39:34,212
- Yeah.
- What?

442
00:39:34,214 --> 00:39:36,798
Glenn told me I could tell everyone
if that's what I wanted to do.

443
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,002
Could get Nicholas exiled.

444
00:39:40,004 --> 00:39:42,337
He'd die out there.

445
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:44,256
Could have done that.

446
00:39:45,809 --> 00:39:47,342
You could do that now.

447
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:50,178
He got Noah killed
and he tried to kill Glenn?

448
00:39:51,649 --> 00:39:53,899
Glenn saves people.

449
00:39:53,901 --> 00:39:55,851
Even people like that.

450
00:40:01,742 --> 00:40:03,742
<i>I couldn't accept it either.</i>

451
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:07,112
But then I thought about you.

452
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:09,197
How we were on different
sides of that fence

453
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:11,199
on the worst day of my life.

454
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:16,061
And now you're one of the most
important people in the world to me.

455
00:40:18,008 --> 00:40:20,959
Things can get better.

456
00:40:20,961 --> 00:40:22,761
We can make them better.

457
00:40:24,715 --> 00:40:26,548
You tell me what you want to do.

458
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,355
I'm just gonna follow
your lead, okay?

459
00:40:34,558 --> 00:40:36,391
Okay.

460
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:39,194
I'm sorry.

461
00:40:47,204 --> 00:40:48,704
You ready?

462
00:40:48,706 --> 00:40:51,406
No. But since you're
doing this thing anyway...

463
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:54,242
All right.

464
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,396
They're still coming.

465
00:41:49,383 --> 00:41:50,882
Get it.

466
00:41:56,106 --> 00:41:57,606
<i>Good.</i>

467
00:41:57,608 --> 00:41:59,224
Let's go.

468
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,363
Here you go.

469
00:42:19,504 --> 00:42:21,265
Oh, thank you.

470
00:42:21,267 --> 00:42:23,150
It's Carol, right?

471
00:42:23,152 --> 00:42:24,935
Yeah.

472
00:42:24,937 --> 00:42:27,604
You been with Rick long?

473
00:42:27,606 --> 00:42:29,573
Since Atlanta.

474
00:42:29,575 --> 00:42:31,275
And were you a cop, too?

475
00:42:32,945 --> 00:42:34,778
Why would you think that?

476
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,414
You're always watching.

477
00:42:37,416 --> 00:42:39,116
You always...

478
00:42:40,286 --> 00:42:41,785
seem ready.

479
00:42:42,955 --> 00:42:44,204
For what?

480
00:42:45,925 --> 00:42:47,958
You know, to handle things.

481
00:42:50,796 --> 00:42:52,629
Aren't you sweet?

482
00:42:59,388 --> 00:43:02,022
What is it?

483
00:43:02,024 --> 00:43:05,893
Got some looky-loos taking a little
constitutional off the shoulder.

484
00:43:07,363 --> 00:43:09,780
They starting a damn walkout.

485
00:43:09,782 --> 00:43:12,316
You want to have Daryl
circle back?

486
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:14,151
No.

487
00:43:14,153 --> 00:43:16,320
Keep moving.
I'll catch up.

488
00:43:16,322 --> 00:43:18,072
Abraham.

489
00:43:24,296 --> 00:43:25,662
Idiot.

490
00:43:37,009 --> 00:43:38,509
<i>Come on!</i>

491
00:43:40,513 --> 00:43:42,763
This is my ride, asshole.

492
00:43:42,765 --> 00:43:44,648
Whoo!

493
00:43:55,327 --> 00:43:57,828
Well, look at me.

494
00:44:03,035 --> 00:44:05,452
You didn't see Reg

495
00:44:05,454 --> 00:44:07,538
the night he got it.

496
00:44:09,792 --> 00:44:11,508
That was a mess.

497
00:44:14,046 --> 00:44:16,046
And Pete.

498
00:44:16,048 --> 00:44:18,682
His face just...

499
00:44:18,684 --> 00:44:21,685
blowing up like Pompeii

500
00:44:21,687 --> 00:44:24,188
right when we were
cheek to cheek.

501
00:44:26,025 --> 00:44:28,692
I still think I got some
of his brains in my ear.

502
00:44:38,237 --> 00:44:40,120
Well, look at that.

503
00:44:41,907 --> 00:44:44,124
All right.

504
00:44:44,126 --> 00:44:47,044
Everything is aces again.

505
00:44:52,001 --> 00:44:54,051
What the hell are you doing?

506
00:44:55,838 --> 00:44:59,423
I'm just grabbing
the bull by the nutsack.

507
00:44:59,425 --> 00:45:02,092
I'm living, darling,

508
00:45:02,094 --> 00:45:04,928
just like you.

509
00:45:17,276 --> 00:45:19,776
I haven't had a chance
to say it yet,

510
00:45:19,778 --> 00:45:22,746
but I'm sorry about Reg.

511
00:45:24,116 --> 00:45:28,752
He was smart and kind.

512
00:45:28,754 --> 00:45:30,420
He was a good man.

513
00:45:34,793 --> 00:45:38,428
It was the right call.
We need this.

514
00:45:42,218 --> 00:45:44,718
What else?

515
00:45:45,938 --> 00:45:48,605
You need to tell me.

516
00:45:48,607 --> 00:45:51,475
People need to be armed
inside the walls.

517
00:45:51,477 --> 00:45:54,027
They need to be trained,
everyone.

518
00:45:58,617 --> 00:46:00,400
Stop.

519
00:46:00,402 --> 00:46:02,152
Here they come.

520
00:46:03,322 --> 00:46:05,706
<i>Carter, heads up.</i>

521
00:46:06,742 --> 00:46:09,076
- Wait, folks.
- Hey.

522
00:46:15,668 --> 00:46:18,635
Use your shovels.
The guns will draw more.

523
00:46:18,637 --> 00:46:20,671
Help us.

524
00:46:20,673 --> 00:46:23,473
You can do this.
You need to, all of you.

525
00:46:32,518 --> 00:46:34,985
Morgan, don't!

526
00:46:56,792 --> 00:46:59,293
You said you don't
take chances anymore.

527
00:47:11,914 --> 00:47:13,916
<i>Time is running out.</i>

528
00:47:14,036 --> 00:47:17,312
<i>He's talking about a dry run tomorrow.
That's it.</i>

529
00:47:17,314 --> 00:47:19,431
<i>Rick stopped Pete.
He stopped him.</i>

530
00:47:19,433 --> 00:47:21,566
<i>This is not
taking out a wife-beater.</i>

531
00:47:21,568 --> 00:47:23,935
<i>He was a murderer, Carter.</i>

532
00:47:23,937 --> 00:47:25,664
<i>What Rick wants
to do is suicide.</i>

533
00:47:25,784 --> 00:47:30,660
<i>I'm sorry, Spencer, but Deanna
is asleep at the wheel.</i>

534
00:47:31,129 --> 00:47:35,230
<i>So it's on us.</i>
<i>We have got to stop him.</i>

535
00:47:35,683 --> 00:47:39,018
<i>What the priest said about
him, about these people,</i>

536
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:40,820
<i>he was right.</i>

537
00:47:40,822 --> 00:47:44,607
<i>How many more of us have to die</i>

538
00:47:44,609 --> 00:47:46,359
<i>before we do something?</i>

539
00:47:46,361 --> 00:47:48,694
'Cause pretty soon
it's gonna be too late.

540
00:47:48,696 --> 00:47:51,914
<i>Carter, you need
to be really careful here.</i>

541
00:47:51,916 --> 00:47:54,367
<i>You're talking about us going
to Deanna and telling her--</i>

542
00:47:54,369 --> 00:47:57,586
<i>No, I'm not talking
about talking some more.</i>

543
00:47:57,588 --> 00:47:59,956
About meetings.
I'm not talking about that.

544
00:47:59,958 --> 00:48:02,875
Plain and simple, we kill him

545
00:48:02,877 --> 00:48:05,378
<i>before he kills us.</i>

546
00:48:18,443 --> 00:48:20,776
Hello.

547
00:48:20,778 --> 00:48:23,062
<i>Carter.</i>

548
00:48:23,064 --> 00:48:25,898
- He heard.
- I didn't.

549
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,034
- I mean, I didn't--
- <i> Carter.</i>

550
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,123
He heard.

551
00:48:35,576 --> 00:48:38,377
<i>Carter, don't.
You can't.</i>

552
00:48:44,919 --> 00:48:47,003
What the hell is going on?

553
00:48:48,806 --> 00:48:51,257
What are you doing?

554
00:48:51,259 --> 00:48:53,926
I'm taking this place
back from you.

555
00:48:56,314 --> 00:48:58,931
That's what you were
talking about in here?

556
00:48:58,933 --> 00:49:00,933
That's what he
was talking about.

557
00:49:04,605 --> 00:49:08,691
See, I would have-- I would
have set up some lookouts.

558
00:49:08,693 --> 00:49:11,777
That would have been
the smart thing.

559
00:49:11,779 --> 00:49:13,612
You know,
if I happened to--

560
00:49:16,367 --> 00:49:20,503
You really think you're gonna
take this community from us?

561
00:49:20,505 --> 00:49:22,922
<i>From Glenn?</i>
<i>From Michonne?</i>

562
00:49:22,924 --> 00:49:24,957
From Daryl?
From me?

563
00:49:26,377 --> 00:49:30,846
Do you have any idea
who you're talking to?

564
00:49:33,134 --> 00:49:35,267
- It was just me.
- What?

565
00:49:35,269 --> 00:49:36,802
It was--
it was just me.

566
00:49:36,804 --> 00:49:40,473
Just-- just kill me.

567
00:49:51,202 --> 00:49:52,818
Rick.

568
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,240
I'm good.

569
00:49:58,242 --> 00:50:00,242
I'm good.

570
00:50:06,717 --> 00:50:09,468
You can try to work with us.

571
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:12,505
You can try to survive.

572
00:50:12,507 --> 00:50:14,640
Would you do that?

573
00:50:44,372 --> 00:50:46,505
It's working.

574
00:50:48,042 --> 00:50:49,842
You were right.

575
00:50:54,966 --> 00:50:58,851
Everyone, we need
to finish this.

576
00:50:58,853 --> 00:51:02,354
We have to keep moving and fan out
down that thing front to back.

577
00:51:02,356 --> 00:51:04,023
<i>Like we said, cops at a parade.</i>

578
00:51:04,025 --> 00:51:05,891
Glenn, you take the back.

579
00:51:05,893 --> 00:51:07,943
- You got the other walkie.
- Got it.

580
00:51:07,945 --> 00:51:09,812
If it gets sloppy,
we fire our weapons,

581
00:51:09,814 --> 00:51:12,031
pull them back on track.

582
00:51:12,033 --> 00:51:15,067
- I'll hit the front.
- Okay, one after the other.

583
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:04,783
Tobin, they're breaking off.

584
00:52:04,785 --> 00:52:06,335
<i>What do you want us to do?</i>

585
00:52:06,337 --> 00:52:08,420
Fire your guns
and draw them back.

586
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:17,963
It's nice out.

587
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:21,467
Yeah.

588
00:52:21,469 --> 00:52:23,018
Hope you don't mind.

589
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:25,804
I wanted to enjoy
the evening a little

590
00:52:25,806 --> 00:52:28,274
and I don't have a porch
over there, so...

591
00:52:34,815 --> 00:52:37,283
Get your stuff.

592
00:52:40,154 --> 00:52:43,205
You should stay
with us over here.

593
00:52:45,243 --> 00:52:47,493
<i>You got room?</i>

594
00:52:47,495 --> 00:52:49,545
<i>We'll make it.</i>

595
00:52:49,547 --> 00:52:52,665
We don't need
to do that anymore.

596
00:52:54,752 --> 00:52:56,585
I know you, Morgan.

597
00:52:58,889 --> 00:53:00,923
Even if this is the first time.

598
00:53:07,848 --> 00:53:09,648
You want to hold her?

599
00:53:16,574 --> 00:53:18,691
Okay.

600
00:53:24,749 --> 00:53:28,917
This is Morgan.

601
00:53:28,919 --> 00:53:30,452
He's a friend of mine.

602
00:53:30,454 --> 00:53:32,171
Hey.

603
00:53:34,375 --> 00:53:36,375
Hi.

604
00:53:40,097 --> 00:53:42,014
Okay.

605
00:53:46,187 --> 00:53:48,020
<i>Let me have a look at you.</i>

606
00:53:48,022 --> 00:53:50,639
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey.

607
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:59,698
You with that man Carter,
in the armory--

608
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:02,785
that's you.

609
00:54:02,787 --> 00:54:04,570
You're still the same man
I met in King County.

610
00:54:04,572 --> 00:54:06,989
The one that came back
and told me it wasn't over.

611
00:54:09,076 --> 00:54:11,910
That was you.

612
00:54:11,912 --> 00:54:14,963
Same you that's right in
front of me right now.

613
00:54:19,086 --> 00:54:21,303
I wanted to kill him.

614
00:54:23,924 --> 00:54:26,258
So it would be easier.

615
00:54:28,396 --> 00:54:31,397
So I wouldn't have to worry

616
00:54:31,399 --> 00:54:33,932
about how he could screw up

617
00:54:33,934 --> 00:54:37,653
or what stupid thing he'd do
next because that's who he is.

618
00:54:37,655 --> 00:54:41,106
Just somebody who
shouldn't be alive now.

619
00:54:44,445 --> 00:54:47,029
I wanted to kill him.

620
00:54:49,784 --> 00:54:53,285
But all that hit me and...

621
00:54:53,287 --> 00:54:55,871
I realized
I didn't have to do it.

622
00:55:03,714 --> 00:55:07,299
He doesn't get it.

623
00:55:07,301 --> 00:55:09,435
Somebody like that...

624
00:55:13,557 --> 00:55:15,891
they're gonna die
no matter what.

625
00:55:30,991 --> 00:55:32,624
Oh, I'm dead.

626
00:55:32,626 --> 00:55:35,077
Carter, take a breath.

627
00:55:35,079 --> 00:55:37,045
Carter.

628
00:55:39,049 --> 00:55:41,500
- Oh, God!
- Be quiet. Shh.

629
00:55:41,502 --> 00:55:45,170
- Oh, God.
- Carter. Carter, shh.

630
00:55:45,172 --> 00:55:47,473
You got to be quiet.

631
00:55:49,226 --> 00:55:51,760
Shh.

632
00:55:57,735 --> 00:55:59,318
<i>It's working.</i>

633
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,353
<i>The gunfire is bringing them</i>
<i>back on the road.</i>

634
00:56:16,537 --> 00:56:19,455
<i>- You got them, Tobin.</i>
<i>- Copy that.</i>

635
00:56:20,541 --> 00:56:22,925
<i>What was that screaming?</i>

636
00:56:22,927 --> 00:56:24,793
That was Carter.

637
00:56:24,795 --> 00:56:27,045
He got bit right in the face.

638
00:56:27,047 --> 00:56:28,847
I stopped him.

639
00:56:37,892 --> 00:56:40,275
We have a good hour until
we have 'em to green

640
00:56:40,277 --> 00:56:43,946
when we hand them off to
Daryl, Sasha, and Abraham.

641
00:56:43,948 --> 00:56:46,365
Why don't you head back, tell
everyone what's happening?

642
00:56:46,367 --> 00:56:48,283
- They should know.
- Okay, Rick, I just--

643
00:56:48,285 --> 00:56:49,985
Will you do that for me?

644
00:56:55,409 --> 00:56:57,376
I'll take care of that one.

645
00:56:57,378 --> 00:57:00,546
Michonne, you take point.

646
00:57:03,467 --> 00:57:06,418
I know it's how it is.

647
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:07,970
I do.

648
00:57:10,007 --> 00:57:12,508
Yeah.

649
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:14,426
I do, too.

650
00:57:50,235 --> 00:57:52,235
<i>Hey.</i>

651
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:58,959
I was just getting
more flares for tomorrow.

652
00:58:10,756 --> 00:58:12,756
I know I haven't--

653
00:58:14,843 --> 00:58:16,810
I just-- I just thought
it might be best

654
00:58:16,812 --> 00:58:20,430
if I let things be for a while.

655
00:58:21,817 --> 00:58:24,351
Ron told me what happened.

656
00:58:24,353 --> 00:58:26,486
Yeah, I wanted to talk
to you about that.

657
00:58:26,488 --> 00:58:28,989
- He shouldn't have been out there.
- No, he shouldn't have.

658
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:31,992
You're right.

659
00:58:31,994 --> 00:58:35,779
But you can't talk
to him like that, Rick.

660
00:58:35,781 --> 00:58:37,831
You can't touch him.

661
00:58:39,284 --> 00:58:40,784
Not you.

662
00:58:40,786 --> 00:58:43,870
Ron needed to hear
every word I said.

663
00:58:43,872 --> 00:58:46,039
That's why I grabbed him.
I wasn't angry.

664
00:58:46,041 --> 00:58:47,757
I was just telling
him the truth.

665
00:58:49,378 --> 00:58:53,046
If it's coming from you,
he can't hear it.

666
00:58:54,716 --> 00:58:57,717
You got to understand that.

667
00:58:57,719 --> 00:58:59,602
He needs to know
how to handle himself.

668
00:58:59,604 --> 00:59:01,888
- I can teach him. I can teach you.
- Rick.

669
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:04,307
- You need to know how.
- Rick.

670
00:59:06,895 --> 00:59:08,778
When I found out
we could have them,

671
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:11,064
I asked Rosita
to start showing me how.

672
00:59:11,066 --> 00:59:14,401
Okay? She's gonna teach me
and I'm gonna teach Ron

673
00:59:14,403 --> 00:59:16,403
and I'm gonna teach Sam.

674
00:59:19,491 --> 00:59:23,209
I heard what you were saying
to us at the meeting.

675
00:59:23,211 --> 00:59:26,546
And at my house
before, you know.

676
00:59:30,002 --> 00:59:32,669
I am gonna fight, Rick.

677
01:00:00,499 --> 01:00:01,998
All right,
this is the finish line.

678
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,284
When we make it to green,
we fall back.

679
01:00:04,286 --> 01:00:06,870
The ditches and ridges
will keep them on the road.

680
01:00:06,872 --> 01:00:09,839
We head home, but Daryl,
Sasha, and Abraham

681
01:00:09,841 --> 01:00:12,208
take them the rest of
the way, 20 miles more.

682
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:13,793
All right, let's go.

683
01:00:19,601 --> 01:00:21,518
Got a question for you.

684
01:00:23,188 --> 01:00:28,141
Just some intel before our
little road trip tomorrow.

685
01:00:28,143 --> 01:00:29,976
Ask me.

686
01:00:32,981 --> 01:00:35,115
You doing this
'cause you want to die?

687
01:00:39,287 --> 01:00:41,037
No.

688
01:01:04,813 --> 01:01:07,430
We're gonna take 'em
right past here.

689
01:01:07,432 --> 01:01:10,817
All that noise
could distract them.

690
01:01:10,819 --> 01:01:14,237
We'll clear it on
our way back tonight.

691
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:16,739
We don't want any
surprises tomorrow.

692
01:01:19,528 --> 01:01:22,495
Hey, what you've done,

693
01:01:22,497 --> 01:01:24,697
you're gonna sit
with it a while,

694
01:01:24,699 --> 01:01:26,282
'cause I don't want you
out here tomorrow.

695
01:01:26,284 --> 01:01:28,084
You're not ready.

696
01:01:28,086 --> 01:01:30,703
You will be.

697
01:01:30,705 --> 01:01:33,590
Some time soon,
I'll make sure of it.

698
01:01:33,592 --> 01:01:35,542
And then you start
to make it right.

699
01:01:36,878 --> 01:01:38,344
Thank you.

700
01:02:07,042 --> 01:02:10,743
I know this sounds insane,

701
01:02:10,745 --> 01:02:13,630
but this is an insane world.

702
01:02:13,632 --> 01:02:17,083
We have to come for them
before they come for us.

703
01:02:17,085 --> 01:02:18,751
It's that simple.

704
01:02:55,290 --> 01:02:57,123
What the hell is happening?

705
01:02:57,125 --> 01:02:59,959
It's a horn or something.

706
01:02:59,961 --> 01:03:02,629
It's pulling the back
half off the road.

707
01:03:02,631 --> 01:03:04,130
Oh, God.

708
01:03:17,562 --> 01:03:20,063
<i>Whatever that is, it's far.</i>

709
01:03:20,065 --> 01:03:23,066
- It sounds like it's coming from--
- Home.

710
