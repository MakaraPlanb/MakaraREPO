<i>Previously on
AMC's "The Walking Dead..."</i>

2
00:00:03,497 --> 00:00:06,161
That's us, that's the Hilltop.

3
00:00:06,281 --> 00:00:07,597
As soon as the walls were built,

4
00:00:07,683 --> 00:00:08,765
the Saviors showed up.

5
00:00:08,851 --> 00:00:10,684
If we go kill Negan,
take out his boys,

6
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:12,152
will you hook us up?

7
00:00:17,993 --> 00:00:19,159
<i>What the hell
are you doing here?</i>

8
00:00:19,244 --> 00:00:20,244
What am I supposed to do?

9
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:22,162
You're supposed to
be someone else!

10
00:00:23,532 --> 00:00:24,431
<i>Lower your gun.</i>

11
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:26,533
<i>We've got a Carol and a Maggie.</i>

12
00:00:26,668 --> 00:00:30,027
<i>I'm thinking that's something
you want to chat about.</i>

13
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:34,841
<i>They need our help.</i>

14
00:00:44,553 --> 00:00:46,920
You are staying here.

15
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:06,690
Damn it, Maggie, let's go!

16
00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:09,493
Not until it's done.

17
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,082
Stop! Or she's dead.

18
00:01:19,671 --> 00:01:22,873
<i>Guns, knives on
the ground right now.</i>

19
00:01:24,186 --> 00:01:26,843
Nice jacket.

20
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,201
For a murderous bitch.

21
00:01:29,441 --> 00:01:31,601
<i>Well, we'll take it
off her before we shoot her.</i>

22
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,057
<i>It ain't on there right, I
can feel it. It ain't stopping.</i>

23
00:01:48,059 --> 00:01:50,193
<i>I'm getting it tighter.
Jesus, give me a second.</i>

24
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:52,028
<i>Son of a bitch, you're
cutting off my circulation.</i>

25
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,830
<i>Well, sport, it's supposed to.</i>

26
00:01:53,832 --> 00:01:55,565
<i>Hell was that?</i>

27
00:02:00,405 --> 00:02:03,306
<i>It's Primo.</i>

28
00:02:03,308 --> 00:02:05,725
Damn it, they've got him.
Give me the walkie.

29
00:02:05,727 --> 00:02:08,478
Babe, what's happening?

30
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:13,583
Lower your gun, prick.

31
00:02:14,953 --> 00:02:18,287
<i>You, with the Colt Python.</i>

32
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:21,090
<i>All of you, lower your
weapons right now.</i>

33
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:32,835
Come on out.
Let's talk.

34
00:02:32,837 --> 00:02:35,271
<i>How many we got?</i>

35
00:02:35,273 --> 00:02:37,256
<i>Eight in sight.</i>

36
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:38,791
Too many.

37
00:02:38,793 --> 00:02:41,127
No, we can take 'em.
We took more.

38
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:47,350
We're not coming out, but we will talk.

39
00:02:47,352 --> 00:02:49,519
Names.

40
00:02:49,521 --> 00:02:51,304
<i>Names!</i>

41
00:02:51,306 --> 00:02:53,272
I'm Maggie, she's Carol.

42
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:55,725
<i>We've got a Carol and a Maggie.</i>

43
00:02:55,727 --> 00:02:58,694
I'm thinking that's something
you want to chat about.

44
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:03,316
Now, we're gonna work
this out right now,

45
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:06,118
and it's going to go our way.

46
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:17,380
You can see we have
one of yours.

47
00:03:17,382 --> 00:03:18,998
We'll trade.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,334
I'm listening.

49
00:03:21,336 --> 00:03:23,586
<i>First I want
to talk to Maggie and Carol,</i>

50
00:03:23,588 --> 00:03:26,005
<i>make sure they're all right.</i>

51
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:27,690
I'm gonna put you on.
You say you're fine.

52
00:03:27,692 --> 00:03:29,559
I'll know if you try
anything else.

53
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:32,144
Rick, it's Carol.

54
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:34,347
- I'm-- I'm fine, but--
- Now you.

55
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:36,182
Rick, it's Maggie.
We're both okay.

56
00:03:36,184 --> 00:03:38,067
- We'll figure thi--
- Shut up.

57
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:40,069
You have your proof.
Let's talk.

58
00:03:40,071 --> 00:03:44,273
<i>All right.</i>
<i>This is the deal right here.</i>

59
00:03:44,275 --> 00:03:48,611
<i>Let 'em go, you can have
your guy back and live.</i>

60
00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:51,414
Two for one,
that's not much of a trade.

61
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,417
<i>You don't have another choice</i>

62
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:56,702
<i>or you would've done
something about it already.</i>

63
00:03:58,089 --> 00:04:00,790
We have to get him back.

64
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:02,708
Primo can take care of himself.

65
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,794
He can patch me up.

66
00:04:04,796 --> 00:04:07,196
I need him,
thanks to that bitch.

67
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,967
<i>You lost your balls, Paula.</i>

68
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:13,185
<i>You should've shot her in the
head so they could hear her die.</i>

69
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:15,521
If you could just shut up,
I'll solve this.

70
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:16,689
Then make the deal or we go in.

71
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:18,724
She said shut up, so shut it.

72
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:20,276
You should be glad
she doesn't have

73
00:04:20,278 --> 00:04:22,812
a sack of gonads to trip over.

74
00:04:22,814 --> 00:04:25,281
<i>Look, I know you're talking it over.</i>

75
00:04:25,283 --> 00:04:27,016
<i>It's a fair trade.</i>

76
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:30,753
<i>Just come out, we do this,</i>

77
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:32,922
<i>we all walk away.</i>

78
00:04:32,924 --> 00:04:35,241
Smug prick.

79
00:04:35,243 --> 00:04:37,243
He must think we're stupid.

80
00:04:37,245 --> 00:04:39,078
That's a good thing.

81
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,666
<i>Do we have a deal?</i>

82
00:04:43,668 --> 00:04:45,918
<i>I'll get back to you.</i>

85
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,220
<i>Turn.</i>

86
00:05:48,962 --> 00:05:50,762

<i>Omega, omega, Saviors down.</i>

00:06:11,532 --> 00:06:13,165
<i>Out west of the--</i>

00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:16,034
<i>15 mi-- on-- way.</i>

93
00:06:16,036 --> 00:06:17,602
<i>We're headed to the break point.</i>

94
00:06:17,604 --> 00:06:20,205
<i>Switch to Theta channel,
same code.</i>

95
00:06:20,207 --> 00:06:22,474
<i>If I'm not there,
toggle to Alpha, listen in.</i>

96
00:06:22,476 --> 00:06:23,916
<i>Copy that.</i>

97
00:06:29,883 --> 00:06:32,451
<i>I hate this damn place.</i>

98
00:06:32,453 --> 00:06:34,619
<i>Safe house.</i>

99
00:06:34,621 --> 00:06:36,421
<i>There ain't nothing safe
about it.</i>

100
00:06:36,423 --> 00:06:38,674
<i>This place is
gonna save our asses.</i>

101
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,474
<i>Get on the ground.</i>

102
00:06:55,476 --> 00:06:57,142
<i>You there.</i>

103
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,983
<i>You, over there.</i>

104
00:07:26,774 --> 00:07:29,508
You're wondering if there's
a way out of this.

105
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,594
There isn't.
Not unless I say so.

106
00:07:47,745 --> 00:07:50,529
<i>Paula, I need backup!</i>

107
00:07:54,418 --> 00:07:56,868
I want to kill you both
right now.

108
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,286
It's taking all I have not to,

109
00:07:58,288 --> 00:08:00,038
so go ahead, I dare you,
try something.

110
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,640
Just see what happens.

111
00:09:22,122 --> 00:09:23,955
When's the last time
anyone checked this place?

112
00:09:23,957 --> 00:09:25,957
<i>It was fine a month ago.</i>

113
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:27,926
<i>Sweetie, that was a month ago.
Shit hards quick.</i>

114
00:09:27,928 --> 00:09:30,512
The guns have gone bye-bye,
the food's gone bye-bye,

115
00:09:30,514 --> 00:09:32,998
and we got growlers
up and down the halls.

116
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,016
<i>Means people can get through, too.</i>

117
00:09:35,018 --> 00:09:36,852
- <i>Maybe we should get gone.</i>
- Carol!

118
00:09:36,854 --> 00:09:38,220
<i>- Yeah? Where the hell to?</i>
- Nowhere.

119
00:09:38,222 --> 00:09:40,305
Got dead in the halls?
Free security.

120
00:09:40,307 --> 00:09:42,724
Those assholes get here
before our people,

121
00:09:42,726 --> 00:09:44,643
the cold bloods
will buy us some time.

122
00:09:44,645 --> 00:09:46,728
Shut up.

123
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,864
Jesus, it's bleeding. It's not
supposed to keep bleeding.

124
00:09:48,866 --> 00:09:51,533
- Molly, give me the rope.
- I'm not losing it.

125
00:09:51,535 --> 00:09:54,152
<i>- I'm not.
- So you grind it out. Jesus, Donnie.</i>

126
00:09:54,154 --> 00:09:57,255
<i>Screw you, 'Chelle!
We have to get him back.</i>

127
00:09:57,257 --> 00:09:59,207
He can fix it.

128
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:01,326
- We have to, Paula.
- No.

129
00:10:01,328 --> 00:10:03,295
I saw them, you didn't.

130
00:10:03,297 --> 00:10:04,763
They took the place down,

131
00:10:04,765 --> 00:10:06,414
they got the guns,
they'll kill us, too.

132
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,999
<i>Hey!</i>

133
00:10:08,001 --> 00:10:09,201
I'm not going down like that,

134
00:10:09,203 --> 00:10:10,919
not after making it this far.

135
00:10:12,606 --> 00:10:14,890
<i>Hey!</i>

136
00:10:17,611 --> 00:10:19,728
What?

137
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:22,681
She's hyperventilating. Somebody
needs to take her gag off.

138
00:10:30,023 --> 00:10:33,024
She's a nervous
little bird, ain't she?

139
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,200
Look at you.

140
00:10:42,202 --> 00:10:44,286
Bitch, how did you
make it this far?

141
00:10:44,288 --> 00:10:49,207
Honey, you need to take some yoga
breaths and calm your ass down.

142
00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:51,209
I can't--

143
00:11:04,558 --> 00:11:05,924
<i>Oh.</i>

144
00:11:06,906 --> 00:11:09,494
You're one of those.

145
00:11:24,328 --> 00:11:26,661
What are you so afraid of?

146
00:11:31,802 --> 00:11:34,502
Are you actually afraid to die?

147
00:11:37,808 --> 00:11:42,294
All this and you're scared
of getting your ticket punched.

148
00:11:45,682 --> 00:11:48,566
It doesn't matter
what happens to me.

149
00:11:50,771 --> 00:11:53,772
Just don't hurt Maggie.

150
00:11:53,774 --> 00:11:55,707
Don't hurt the baby.

151
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,620
Yeah, right.

152
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,208
She got a bun in the
oven, she doesn't look it.

153
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,960
I'm only two months, I think.

154
00:12:17,464 --> 00:12:19,130
You're some kind of stupid,

155
00:12:19,132 --> 00:12:21,383
getting knocked up
at a time like this.

156
00:12:21,385 --> 00:12:23,968
<i>You think that's funny?</i>

157
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,472
When was it ever smart
to get knocked up?

158
00:12:27,474 --> 00:12:30,692
Women used to just die
in childbirth.

159
00:12:30,694 --> 00:12:32,977
And they always thought
the world was gonna end.

160
00:12:32,979 --> 00:12:35,980
<i>Living through it,
why would you just give up?</i>

161
00:12:35,982 --> 00:12:38,783
But are you gonna
live through it?

162
00:12:40,704 --> 00:12:43,405
Anyway, that's cute.

163
00:12:43,407 --> 00:12:45,907
Babies are the point.

164
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:48,259
Children are our future.

165
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:53,331
Making bite-size snacks
for the dead.

166
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:58,219
The point is to stay standing.

167
00:12:58,221 --> 00:12:59,504
<i>No.</i>

168
00:12:59,506 --> 00:13:03,258
Walkers do that.

169
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,677
I'm choosing something.

170
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,514
That's right.

171
00:13:09,516 --> 00:13:11,566
You are.

172
00:13:11,568 --> 00:13:13,551
You did.

173
00:13:36,376 --> 00:13:38,543
The baby.

174
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:49,888
Honey, in case
you haven't noticed,

175
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:53,625
you've got bigger problems
than a little secondhand smoke.

176
00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:57,796
Molls.

177
00:14:04,237 --> 00:14:06,037
Y'all are worse than a bunch

178
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:09,908
of evangelical second graders.

179
00:14:21,755 --> 00:14:24,756
Those things'll kill you.

180
00:14:24,758 --> 00:14:26,925
They already have.

181
00:14:26,927 --> 00:14:30,678
I'm a dead woman walking.

182
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,183
Which puts us
in exactly the same boat.

183
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,229
Ah!

184
00:14:53,786 --> 00:14:55,803
My arm feels like it's on fire.

185
00:14:55,805 --> 00:14:58,622
You pull that off, you gonna
be nothing but a spigot.

186
00:14:58,624 --> 00:15:00,974
- Okay, hold on.
- Agh!

187
00:15:00,976 --> 00:15:04,611
Scout crew is coming. They're
30 minutes out, maybe less.

188
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:07,231
<i>He doesn't have 30 minutes.</i>

189
00:15:07,233 --> 00:15:09,983
His nerves are dying.

190
00:15:09,985 --> 00:15:12,453
If he doesn't get medical help,
he's gonna lose his arm,

191
00:15:12,455 --> 00:15:15,739
maybe his life.

192
00:15:15,741 --> 00:15:18,992
I'm not a doctor, but my dad lost
his leg, and I know that much.

193
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,468
Your man, Primo,
you think he can help you?

194
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:33,006
It's time to end this.

195
00:15:33,008 --> 00:15:35,142
<i>Talk to Rick.</i>

196
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,930
30 minutes.

197
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,780
You know my problem?

198
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:05,005
She did this to me.

199
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:06,790
She did it and she's just
sitting there

200
00:16:06,792 --> 00:16:08,792
right as rain, fully intact.

201
00:16:08,794 --> 00:16:12,212
<i>- Hey.</i>
- No, you're not gonna make the trade.

202
00:16:12,214 --> 00:16:13,797
<i>And we just do 'em both now.</i>

203
00:16:16,468 --> 00:16:18,235
<i>No, we wait for the others.</i>

204
00:16:18,237 --> 00:16:21,471
We have to be smart.
We need insurance.

205
00:16:21,473 --> 00:16:22,806
Then shoot her in the arm, too.

206
00:16:22,808 --> 00:16:25,108
No.

207
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:29,112
You really gonna stick up for
some gutless bitch over me?

208
00:16:32,484 --> 00:16:35,903
- God damn it!
<i>- Shut up.</i>

209
00:16:35,905 --> 00:16:37,871
<i>Don't push me, Paula.</i>

210
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:40,257
<i>Shut up!</i>

211
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:48,081
Leave her alone!

212
00:16:51,203 --> 00:16:53,754
No! No!

213
00:16:55,507 --> 00:16:57,758
You dumb, uppity bitch!

214
00:17:11,857 --> 00:17:14,908
You really are
some kind of stupid.

215
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:20,414
Take her out.
See if she knows anything.

216
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,783
Should've done that before.

217
00:17:28,774 --> 00:17:30,591
Move.

218
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,143
You got nice clothes,

219
00:17:50,145 --> 00:17:53,647
time to make babies.

220
00:17:53,649 --> 00:17:56,066
You're holed up somewhere good.

221
00:17:57,069 --> 00:17:58,318
Tell me where.

222
00:18:16,255 --> 00:18:18,088
Don't draw this out, bitch.

223
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:21,675
Just tell me where.

224
00:18:21,677 --> 00:18:24,761
Help yourself
and the baby in your belly.

225
00:18:26,265 --> 00:18:29,933
The way you stay alive
is you produce for us.

226
00:18:34,356 --> 00:18:36,606
You're not the good guys.

227
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,027
You should know that.

228
00:18:43,198 --> 00:18:44,881
<i>He got you good, kid.</i>

229
00:18:44,883 --> 00:18:46,867
He's in pain.

230
00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:49,119
Guys can't handle pain.

231
00:18:52,374 --> 00:18:54,791
<i>Excuse me?</i>

232
00:18:57,329 --> 00:18:59,796
Just wanted to say thank you

233
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:03,333
for helping Maggie,
for helping me.

234
00:19:06,171 --> 00:19:07,804
My husband Ed,
he used to--

235
00:19:07,806 --> 00:19:10,307
Yeah? I don't care
if your old man

236
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:12,476
used to ring your bell.

237
00:19:12,478 --> 00:19:16,980
I see exactly
who you are, Carol.

238
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:20,984
I know.

239
00:19:20,986 --> 00:19:22,819
You're pathetic.

240
00:19:22,821 --> 00:19:25,722
You wanna think
we're just the same?

241
00:19:25,724 --> 00:19:26,957
Go ahead.

242
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:29,426
You're wrong.

243
00:19:29,428 --> 00:19:32,729
He's just a warm body
for my bed.

244
00:19:32,731 --> 00:19:36,433
That's it. I could
kill him in his sleep.

245
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:54,684
Do you really believe
in that crap?

246
00:20:00,793 --> 00:20:03,577
My faith got me through
the death of my daughter.

247
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:05,595
<i>Hmm.</i>

248
00:20:05,597 --> 00:20:08,765
Well, the good news is maybe
you'll see her again soon.

249
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:19,092
<i>What happened?</i>

250
00:20:21,296 --> 00:20:23,713
I stole something.
Got caught.

251
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,551
What?

252
00:20:27,553 --> 00:20:30,787
<i>Gas, from this place.</i>

253
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:32,656
- Why?
- <i>To get a new car.</i>

254
00:20:32,658 --> 00:20:34,825
Look for my boyfriend's body.

255
00:20:37,296 --> 00:20:38,929
Did you find him?

256
00:20:38,931 --> 00:20:41,498
<i>He was blown up.</i>

257
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,834
<i>Not much to find.</i>

258
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,574
<i>"Frankie."</i>

259
00:20:50,576 --> 00:20:53,577
- Was that his name?
- Hell, no.

260
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:57,330
I barely knew him.

261
00:20:57,332 --> 00:20:59,116
He was a dick.

262
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:06,623
Frank was my dad.

263
00:21:09,361 --> 00:21:11,761
And that's what I was
gonna name the baby.

264
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:19,820
- I'm sorry.
- No.

265
00:21:23,442 --> 00:21:25,775
You aren't.

266
00:21:25,777 --> 00:21:28,111
I'm not planning to die today.

267
00:21:28,113 --> 00:21:31,164
Yeah, me neither.

268
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:36,119
Thing is, one of us is wrong.

269
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:43,293
Just tell me where.

270
00:21:57,186 --> 00:21:59,681
<i>Have you thought about it?</i>

271
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:01,806
<i>Talk to me.</i>

272
00:22:04,678 --> 00:22:07,262
You weren't listening.

273
00:22:07,264 --> 00:22:09,764
I said I'd contact you.

274
00:22:09,766 --> 00:22:11,599
<i>Would it make a difference</i>

275
00:22:11,601 --> 00:22:13,768
<i>if I said I was sorry
about that?</i>

276
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:16,154
What do you think?

277
00:22:16,156 --> 00:22:19,324
<i>I think we're gonna make the trade,</i>

278
00:22:19,326 --> 00:22:20,942
<i>so tell me where.</i>

279
00:22:23,613 --> 00:22:25,830
We haven't agreed to that.

280
00:22:25,832 --> 00:22:29,000
<i>You will.</i>

281
00:22:29,002 --> 00:22:32,120
You know what?
I'm not so sure.

282
00:22:33,456 --> 00:22:35,840
We'd be taking most of the risk,

283
00:22:35,842 --> 00:22:38,626
not getting much
in the way of a reward.

284
00:22:38,628 --> 00:22:43,181
<i>The other option won't work out for you.</i>

285
00:22:46,469 --> 00:22:49,354
We'll take our chances.

286
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,148
You don't have to do this.

287
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,482
You don't have to fight.

288
00:23:01,484 --> 00:23:04,819
Your people killed
all of my people.

289
00:23:04,821 --> 00:23:06,154
Of course we gotta fight.

290
00:23:06,156 --> 00:23:09,691
- We didn't want to.
- But you did.

291
00:23:09,693 --> 00:23:11,859
So tell me why.

292
00:23:14,547 --> 00:23:17,715
Your people ambushed
my people on the road,

293
00:23:17,717 --> 00:23:19,834
tried to take everything we had.

294
00:23:23,256 --> 00:23:26,090
They were gonna kill them.

295
00:23:26,092 --> 00:23:28,893
Well, damn.

296
00:23:28,895 --> 00:23:32,263
So now we know what
happened to T's group.

297
00:23:33,433 --> 00:23:36,267
Those idiots.

298
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:38,353
Probably put on a big show.

299
00:23:38,355 --> 00:23:42,774
Okay, fair play.

300
00:23:42,776 --> 00:23:45,360
You were just
defending yourselves.

301
00:23:47,947 --> 00:23:52,834
But, see, your people killed
them on the road, right?

302
00:23:52,836 --> 00:23:56,087
<i>Blew them to pieces.</i>

303
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:58,289
<i>So, why not stop?</i>

304
00:24:03,129 --> 00:24:05,713
They said they were
working for Negan.

305
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:09,717
And what do you think
you know about Negan?

306
00:24:11,805 --> 00:24:13,938
He sounded like a maniac.

307
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,606
We were scared.
We had to stop him.

308
00:24:15,608 --> 00:24:18,693
Sweetie, sweetie.

309
00:24:18,695 --> 00:24:21,396
We are all Negan.

310
00:24:24,451 --> 00:24:28,119
What do you mean?

311
00:24:30,824 --> 00:24:33,241
What does that mean?

312
00:24:55,014 --> 00:24:56,764
Can I have one?

313
00:24:57,934 --> 00:25:01,018
Well, look at you, little bird.

314
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:04,155
I didn't think you approved.

315
00:25:04,157 --> 00:25:06,324
I don't.

316
00:25:28,681 --> 00:25:31,048
You are weak.

317
00:25:32,218 --> 00:25:34,552
What are you so afraid of?

318
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,024
So scared, you can't even
stick to your own principles.

319
00:25:43,146 --> 00:25:46,364
You don't want me to stick
to my own principles.

320
00:25:55,792 --> 00:25:59,660
I was a secretary before.

321
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:06,217
I fetched coffee for my boss

322
00:26:06,219 --> 00:26:09,053
and made him feel
good about himself.

323
00:26:09,055 --> 00:26:11,339
I spent most of my days reading

324
00:26:11,341 --> 00:26:13,925
stupid inspirational
e-mails

325
00:26:13,927 --> 00:26:16,561
to try and feel good
about myself.

326
00:26:16,563 --> 00:26:19,931
There was this one
that kept going around.

327
00:26:19,933 --> 00:26:23,184
<i>A young woman
was having a hard time</i>

328
00:26:23,186 --> 00:26:26,070
<i>and told her mom
she wanted to give up,</i>

329
00:26:26,072 --> 00:26:27,905
so her mom went to the kitchen

330
00:26:27,907 --> 00:26:31,325
and started boiling
three pots of water.

331
00:26:31,327 --> 00:26:33,861
She put a carrot in one,
an egg in another,

332
00:26:33,863 --> 00:26:36,364
and ground coffee beans
in the last one.

333
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:40,034
<i>After they had boiled
a while, her mom said,</i>

334
00:26:40,036 --> 00:26:43,621
<i>"Look, all three things went
through the same boiling water.</i>

335
00:26:43,623 --> 00:26:47,141
<i>The carrot went in strong
and came out soft.</i>

336
00:26:47,143 --> 00:26:50,378
<i>The egg was fragile
and came out hard.</i>

337
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:54,465
But the coffee beans
changed the water itself."

338
00:26:58,137 --> 00:27:00,888
You're supposed to want
to be the coffee beans.

339
00:27:04,227 --> 00:27:06,794
<i>See, to me, coffee
was just a thing</i>

340
00:27:06,796 --> 00:27:08,563
<i>that my boss would drink up.</i>

341
00:27:08,565 --> 00:27:10,631
<i>No matter how many times
I refilled his damn cup,</i>

342
00:27:10,633 --> 00:27:13,434
<i>it was just never enough.</i>

343
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,741
<i>I was at work when
the Army took over DC.</i>

344
00:27:22,078 --> 00:27:23,995
We weren't allowed to leave.

345
00:27:23,997 --> 00:27:27,615
They had to evacuate all the
important people first--

346
00:27:27,617 --> 00:27:31,502
members of Congress,
government employees.

347
00:27:31,504 --> 00:27:34,422
So I was stuck with my boss.

348
00:27:34,424 --> 00:27:36,841
Not my family--

349
00:27:36,843 --> 00:27:41,646
my husband, my four girls...

350
00:27:52,992 --> 00:27:55,509
My boss was weak and stupid
and he was going to die

351
00:27:55,511 --> 00:27:58,012
and he was going
to take me down, too.

352
00:27:58,014 --> 00:28:00,865
He was the first person I killed

353
00:28:00,867 --> 00:28:02,883
so that I could live.

354
00:28:05,338 --> 00:28:07,455
I stopped counting
when I hit double digits.

355
00:28:07,457 --> 00:28:10,458
That's right around the time
I stopped feeling bad about it.

356
00:28:12,462 --> 00:28:14,679
I am not like you.

357
00:28:16,132 --> 00:28:19,684
I'm still me, but better.

358
00:28:19,686 --> 00:28:23,020
I lost everything
and it made me stronger.

359
00:28:23,022 --> 00:28:24,889
You sure about that?

360
00:28:24,891 --> 00:28:26,691
I'm alive.

361
00:28:26,693 --> 00:28:29,143
With those people,
those killers.

362
00:28:29,145 --> 00:28:31,145
<i>Your people are killers, Carol.</i>

363
00:28:31,147 --> 00:28:34,198
That makes you a killer.

364
00:28:47,163 --> 00:28:49,246
You-- you're the one.

365
00:28:49,248 --> 00:28:51,198
Excuse me?

366
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,884
You're the one
who's afraid to die.

367
00:28:53,886 --> 00:28:56,671
And you're going to.

368
00:28:56,673 --> 00:29:00,174
You will die.

369
00:29:01,966 --> 00:29:04,729
It's what's gonna happen
if you don't work this out.

370
00:29:07,102 --> 00:29:09,850
Are you going to kill me?

371
00:29:12,438 --> 00:29:14,739
I hope not.

372
00:29:22,023 --> 00:29:26,793
Asshole, are you there?

373
00:29:26,795 --> 00:29:28,795
<i>I'm here.</i>

374
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,551
We've thought about it.
We want to make the trade.

375
00:29:34,553 --> 00:29:36,970
<i>That's good.</i>

376
00:29:36,972 --> 00:29:40,724
There's a large field with a
sign that says "God is dead"

377
00:29:40,726 --> 00:29:44,011
about two miles
down I-66.

378
00:29:44,013 --> 00:29:46,730
Good visibility
in all directions.

379
00:29:46,732 --> 00:29:49,700
<i>We'll meet you there.
10 minutes?</i>

380
00:29:50,903 --> 00:29:52,319
10 minutes.

381
00:29:56,025 --> 00:29:59,493
Mm-mm.
Now, that was too easy.

382
00:29:59,495 --> 00:30:02,162
Maybe they're just itching
to get their people back.

383
00:30:02,164 --> 00:30:04,164
<i>No, there was no static.
There should've been static.</i>

384
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:06,216
<i>They're close.
They're probably already here.</i>

385
00:30:06,218 --> 00:30:07,918
<i>We were careful,
but there were tracks.</i>

386
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,503
- <i>There had to be.</i>
- No...

387
00:30:09,505 --> 00:30:11,338
They killed everybody back home.
They have the weapons.

388
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,723
They know what they're doing.

389
00:30:12,725 --> 00:30:14,558
They're probably
waiting to kill us

390
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,059
as soon as we walk
out those doors.

391
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:18,345
- That's what we'd do.
- No.

392
00:30:21,066 --> 00:30:24,101
You have to listen
to me, please.

393
00:30:24,103 --> 00:30:26,937
Rick is a man of his word.

394
00:30:26,939 --> 00:30:29,856
He wouldn't put me and
Maggie at risk to attack.

395
00:30:29,858 --> 00:30:33,026
Then he's just
as stupid as you are.

396
00:30:34,863 --> 00:30:37,080
What's your ETA?

397
00:30:37,082 --> 00:30:39,099
<i>A few minutes away,</i>

398
00:30:39,101 --> 00:30:41,084
<i>- but the car is running on fumes.
- We have gas.</i>

399
00:30:41,086 --> 00:30:43,036
<i>We'll fill you up
and then we move.</i>

400
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:45,255
<i>Radio when you're
back in the perimeter.</i>

401
00:30:45,257 --> 00:30:47,874
<i>Copy that.</i>

402
00:30:47,876 --> 00:30:49,960
We gotta get ready.

403
00:30:49,962 --> 00:30:53,130
Pull 'Chelle out so she
doesn't get stuck in a fight.

404
00:30:53,132 --> 00:30:55,215
We have to be ready
to move at any second.

405
00:30:55,217 --> 00:30:56,800
What about the girl?

406
00:30:58,721 --> 00:30:59,986
Leave her for now.

407
00:30:59,988 --> 00:31:02,806
If we leave, we travel light.

408
00:31:02,808 --> 00:31:06,159
And if the pricks are here,
we pick 'em off at the door.

409
00:31:16,772 --> 00:31:18,805
<i>Molls, we need this hall clear.</i>

410
00:31:59,114 --> 00:32:01,531
Just a sec, sugar.

411
00:32:30,412 --> 00:32:32,279
Are you okay?

412
00:32:32,281 --> 00:32:34,681
I have to be.

413
00:32:34,683 --> 00:32:36,650
They've spread out, but I think
we can make it past them.

414
00:32:36,652 --> 00:32:39,319
- We have to try.
- We can't leave them alive.

415
00:32:39,321 --> 00:32:40,904
No, we should just go.

416
00:32:40,906 --> 00:32:43,423
Carol, we have to finish this.
We have to.

417
00:33:30,122 --> 00:33:32,539
He was already dead.

418
00:33:32,541 --> 00:33:36,092
- <i>He's turning.</i>
- We should go.

419
00:33:37,379 --> 00:33:39,045
We need a gun.

420
00:33:40,632 --> 00:33:42,148
Give me that.

421
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:15,148
Eat shit and die, Donnie!

422
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:17,918
Where are ya, Magnolia?

423
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,337
I wanna bloody up
that nice--

424
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:25,091
Agh!

425
00:34:34,269 --> 00:34:35,936
Let's go.

426
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:21,941
<i>They're using
them to keep us in,</i>

427
00:35:21,943 --> 00:35:23,693
<i>keep the others out.</i>

428
00:35:26,302 --> 00:35:28,188
<i>Come on.</i>

429
00:35:28,308 --> 00:35:30,116
<i>We have to find 'em.</i>

430
00:35:44,382 --> 00:35:45,798
Just run.

431
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,883
Shoot her.

432
00:35:47,885 --> 00:35:52,388
Go on, do it.

433
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:56,325
You've killed Donnie,
you've killed Molly.

434
00:35:56,327 --> 00:35:59,395
<i>Your people have
destroyed my home.</i>

435
00:35:59,397 --> 00:36:01,280
- Get outta here.
- Carol.

436
00:36:01,282 --> 00:36:02,898
<i>You have no idea.</i>

437
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,319
The things I've done,

438
00:36:06,321 --> 00:36:08,287
what I've given up,

439
00:36:08,289 --> 00:36:11,324
<i>what I had to do.</i>

440
00:36:11,326 --> 00:36:13,676
- Just run.
<i>- Carol, shoot her.</i>

441
00:36:13,678 --> 00:36:16,829
Go ahead. I've already
lost everything.

442
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:23,419
<i>Paula?</i>

443
00:36:23,421 --> 00:36:25,304
<i>Paula?</i>

444
00:36:27,175 --> 00:36:28,975
<i>Molly?</i>

445
00:36:40,204 --> 00:36:42,655
You lying bitch!

446
00:37:00,842 --> 00:37:02,758
I'll do it.

447
00:37:07,215 --> 00:37:10,132
You're good.

448
00:37:10,134 --> 00:37:11,851
Nervous little bird.

449
00:37:13,638 --> 00:37:16,022
You were her.

450
00:37:18,726 --> 00:37:21,844
But not now, right?

451
00:37:24,065 --> 00:37:25,314
Me, too.

452
00:37:27,068 --> 00:37:30,319
I told you to run.

453
00:37:30,321 --> 00:37:33,406
<i>If you could do all this,</i>

454
00:37:33,408 --> 00:37:37,076
what were you
so afraid of, Carol?

455
00:37:49,273 --> 00:37:52,241
I was afraid of this.

456
00:38:21,205 --> 00:38:23,422
<i>Paula, we're
approaching the perimeter.</i>

457
00:38:23,424 --> 00:38:25,074
<i>Are we a go?</i>

458
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,387
<i>Do you copy?</i>

459
00:38:46,447 --> 00:38:48,948
Meet us on the kill floor.

460
00:38:53,905 --> 00:38:57,907
I think I might have
killed 18 people.

461
00:38:57,909 --> 00:38:59,408
20.

462
00:39:02,296 --> 00:39:04,747
I should've killed
Donnie, too, in the woods.

463
00:39:04,749 --> 00:39:07,583
I had a clear shot.
I didn't miss.

464
00:39:11,005 --> 00:39:14,006
None of this would've happened
if I had just killed him.

465
00:39:14,008 --> 00:39:17,259
- Don't think about it.
- I can't stop.

466
00:39:18,563 --> 00:39:21,096
We're almost done.

467
00:39:37,281 --> 00:39:39,832
<i>Careful. The floor's slick.</i>

468
00:39:39,834 --> 00:39:41,534
<i>You sure this is it?</i>

469
00:39:41,536 --> 00:39:43,702
<i>She said kill floor.</i>

470
00:39:46,174 --> 00:39:48,324
<i>Hey, this one's locked.</i>

471
00:39:53,381 --> 00:39:55,047
What the hell?!
Agh!

472
00:41:08,372 --> 00:41:10,372
Maggie.

473
00:41:10,374 --> 00:41:11,757
You okay?

474
00:41:11,759 --> 00:41:14,093
We got your trail.

475
00:41:14,095 --> 00:41:16,762
- You start a fire?
- Yeah.

476
00:41:16,764 --> 00:41:19,214
Hey, you good?

477
00:41:19,216 --> 00:41:20,966
No.

478
00:41:20,968 --> 00:41:22,718
Come here.

479
00:41:24,472 --> 00:41:27,389
They're dead. They're all
dead, the ones that took us.

480
00:41:27,391 --> 00:41:29,224
They're all dead.

481
00:41:29,226 --> 00:41:31,610
Hey, are you okay?

482
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:35,397
I just...

483
00:41:35,399 --> 00:41:37,466
I can't anymore.

484
00:41:38,469 --> 00:41:39,485
It's okay.

485
00:41:39,487 --> 00:41:41,987
Your friends are dead.

486
00:41:41,989 --> 00:41:44,740
No one's coming for ya.

487
00:41:44,742 --> 00:41:46,241
So you might as well talk.

488
00:41:46,243 --> 00:41:49,328
Let him burn.

489
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:51,997
I'm gonna ask you
one last time...

490
00:41:53,084 --> 00:41:54,833
how'd you get the bike?

491
00:41:54,835 --> 00:41:56,752
- We found it.
- Like hell you did.

492
00:41:56,754 --> 00:41:57,920
We found it.

493
00:41:57,922 --> 00:41:59,672
Was Negan in
that building last night

494
00:41:59,674 --> 00:42:01,423
or was he here?

495
00:42:07,148 --> 00:42:08,981
Both.

496
00:42:10,851 --> 00:42:12,935
I'm Negan, shithead.

497
00:42:14,772 --> 00:42:17,439
There's a whole world of fun
that we can talk about,

498
00:42:17,441 --> 00:42:18,640
so let's have a chat.

499
00:42:18,642 --> 00:42:19,922
I'm sorry it had
to come to this.
