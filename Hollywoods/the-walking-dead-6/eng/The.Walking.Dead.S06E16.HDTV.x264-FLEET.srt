00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:03,472
Previously, on
AMC's "The Walking Dead."

2
00:00:05,176 --> 00:00:06,216
What the hell is he doing?

3
00:00:06,505 --> 00:00:08,261
I know where Daryl's going!

4
00:00:08,363 --> 00:00:10,096
Carol's still out here...

5
00:00:10,232 --> 00:00:11,631
And I will find her, you go.

6
00:00:19,774 --> 00:00:21,324
Ahhh...
Ah, ahh!

7
00:00:22,444 --> 00:00:23,444
Hey!

8
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,581
Hi, Daryl...

9
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,827
Hey.

10
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:16,162
Hey, boy.

11
00:01:19,234 --> 00:01:21,701
Oh, you're fine.

12
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,876
You are fine.

13
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,578
Hey.

14
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,381
Hey, come here.

15
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:35,251
You... are alive.

16
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,558
Glenn's still not back.
I need to be there for Maggie.

17
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,894
- I said no.
- Carl.

18
00:02:34,896 --> 00:02:36,396
Look, you were wrong before.

19
00:02:36,398 --> 00:02:38,281
This place isn't too big to protect.

20
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,700
And you need to stay back
and help protect it.

21
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,201
This place is ready.

22
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,620
Most of us have been
trained, you know that.

23
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,206
If you were worried about an
attack, you wouldn't be leaving.

24
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,875
You know how far the Hilltop is?

25
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,077
You know what could happen?

26
00:02:52,514 --> 00:02:55,181
Those Saviors are out there.

27
00:02:55,183 --> 00:02:57,116
You know what they did to Denise,

28
00:02:57,118 --> 00:03:01,087
what they tried to do
with Maggie and Carol,

29
00:03:01,089 --> 00:03:04,090
to Daryl, to Rosita, to Eugene.

30
00:03:06,094 --> 00:03:07,949
That's not happening
to you, all right?

31
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:10,129
I'm not gonna let it.

32
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,776
Any change?

33
00:03:23,778 --> 00:03:25,278
She's getting worse.

34
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,529
Good call on the transport.

35
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:28,414
Well, I figured she'd
be more comfortable.

36
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,999
It also means you got room for more.

37
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:33,486
They're out there, so I'm
gonna be there with you.

38
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,789
We are.

39
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,291
Package deal.

40
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,928
Uh, what she said.

41
00:03:46,634 --> 00:03:48,801
You want to run into them, right?

42
00:03:51,556 --> 00:03:54,057
You hope they show up.

43
00:03:56,244 --> 00:03:59,896
Jesus, this is about getting
Maggie to a doctor, not about...

44
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,449
Screw you, I'm going.

45
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:06,753
Enid, stop.
Just wait.

46
00:04:06,755 --> 00:04:08,921
Look, it's a long trip,
and you're just getting over--

47
00:04:08,923 --> 00:04:10,656
It's a superficial graze,

48
00:04:10,658 --> 00:04:12,992
proteins are binding, plus we need
to discuss ammunition production

49
00:04:12,994 --> 00:04:15,745
and manufacture, so let's roll.

50
00:04:15,747 --> 00:04:18,548
I already tried. Give him an
inch, he's taking a mile.

51
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,550
I'm only asking for 23, give or take,

52
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,218
depending on the route.

53
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,087
I know I can be of some help.

54
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:26,639
Now's the time and here's the place.

55
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,341
Don't shine me.

56
00:04:28,343 --> 00:04:30,510
I'll be your anchorman.
Yes, I damn will.

57
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,493
Why the face?

58
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,763
I hope you're not putting this on us.

59
00:04:50,765 --> 00:04:53,699
Huh? I mean, we showed your
people the way forward.

60
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:55,835
We gave you rules.

61
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,938
You broke the rules,
so folks had to die.

62
00:04:59,974 --> 00:05:01,207
The one who fired the first shot,

63
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:03,810
we strung him up
to make an example of him.

64
00:05:03,812 --> 00:05:06,512
It could've stopped there.

65
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:10,349
But you people still didn't listen.

66
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,719
You wanted to fight us.

67
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:16,656
So this is how it has to be.

68
00:05:17,892 --> 00:05:19,275
Get out of my way.

69
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,493
Carl!

70
00:05:23,064 --> 00:05:24,897
Just grab some pistols
from the closet.

71
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:27,266
But hurry.
We've gotta go now.

72
00:05:39,414 --> 00:05:41,581
Carl!

73
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:42,748
Damn it!

74
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,317
Please, please.

75
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,586
No, no, please--
oh! No!

76
00:05:46,588 --> 00:05:49,789
Please, don't.
Oh! Please.

77
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,592
Please!

78
00:05:52,594 --> 00:05:55,511
Carl! Carl!

79
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,467
What happens if you don't come back?

80
00:06:03,271 --> 00:06:05,271
How am I supposed to live with that?

81
00:06:05,273 --> 00:06:07,356
What the hell am I supposed to do?

82
00:06:10,111 --> 00:06:11,994
Just survive somehow.

83
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:18,951
We're ready to protect this place

84
00:06:18,953 --> 00:06:20,586
and the Saviors know it.

85
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,004
That's why they grabbed Eugene.

86
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,674
Look, it's not up for discussion.

87
00:06:26,461 --> 00:06:28,461
Then you're just gonna have
to punch me in the face

88
00:06:28,463 --> 00:06:30,713
and tie me up again.

89
00:06:30,715 --> 00:06:32,632
'Cause that's what
it's gonna take to stop me.

90
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,021
Go on.

91
00:06:45,396 --> 00:06:48,481
We have 24-hour shifts set up
on each of the watchtowers,

92
00:06:48,483 --> 00:06:51,567
each one of them
fully supplied and ready.

93
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:53,119
In the case that we're incurred upon,

94
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,705
we have drivers assigned,
evacuation and distraction,

95
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:58,374
and the rendezvous we discussed.

96
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,160
In the event of any emergency,

97
00:07:01,162 --> 00:07:04,046
my first priority is Judith.

98
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:07,166
I will not fail you.

99
00:07:07,168 --> 00:07:11,170
Are you comfortable leaving me in
charge of Alexandria's defense?

100
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,780
Yes.

101
00:07:20,782 --> 00:07:23,399
Hey, Rick.

102
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:27,069
If the Saviors do show up...

103
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:30,690
I don't know, I'm thinking,
if it's not too late,

104
00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:33,192
should we try and make
some kind of deal?

105
00:07:33,194 --> 00:07:35,661
Tell them to wait for me.

106
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,530
I got a deal for them.

107
00:07:37,532 --> 00:07:38,831
Let's go.

108
00:08:15,937 --> 00:08:18,004
Whoa, whoa.

109
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,134
Carol?

110
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,756
Hey.

111
00:08:39,927 --> 00:08:42,094
I told you not to come.

112
00:08:42,096 --> 00:08:45,665
And I'm gonna start
listening to you real soon.

113
00:08:51,272 --> 00:08:53,072
Here, let me see.

114
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,556
What is this?

115
00:09:27,558 --> 00:09:31,861
This is us about to make
an example out of you.

116
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,647
To who?
My people--

117
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:37,583
everyone at the library,
they're dead.

Originally aired April 03, 2016

121
00:11:02,653 --> 00:11:03,919
Hey.

122
00:11:03,921 --> 00:11:05,821
Hey.

123
00:11:05,823 --> 00:11:08,624
We're gonna get there.

124
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,794
The doctor at the Hilltop,

125
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,729
he's gonna make things better.

126
00:11:19,704 --> 00:11:22,538
Hey.

127
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,907
How do you know?

128
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:29,979
Everything we've done,
we've done together.

129
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:33,149
We got here together
and we're still here.

130
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:38,054
Things have happened, but
it's always worked out for us

131
00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:40,706
'cause it's always been all of us.

132
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,992
That's how I know.

133
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,330
'Cause as long as it's all of us,

134
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,299
we can do anything.

135
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:14,356
It's a walker.

136
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,025
It's hard to get.

137
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:19,495
I was going to, but I
was too busy bleeding.

138
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:27,036
Pressure should help,
but you need stitches,

139
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:30,339
antibiotics to make sure
you don't get an infection.

140
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:39,381
Be dark in a few hours.

141
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:43,219
I'll walk the camp, make sure
we're safe for the night.

142
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:46,355
And at dawn, we will head back,

143
00:12:46,357 --> 00:12:48,607
get you some help.

144
00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:50,609
Okay?

145
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,647
No.

146
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,670
What the bitch?

147
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:27,513
What?

148
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,331
Enemy close.

149
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,573
We doing this?

150
00:13:38,643 --> 00:13:40,276
No.

151
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:17,846
He's someone who was with a whole
lot of someones who didn't listen.

152
00:14:21,552 --> 00:14:23,903
We can make a deal

153
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,872
right here, right now.

154
00:14:26,874 --> 00:14:31,126
That's right, we can.

155
00:14:31,128 --> 00:14:33,529
Give us all your stuff.

156
00:14:33,531 --> 00:14:35,197
We'll probably
have to kill one of you.

157
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,498
That's just the way it is,

158
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,035
but then we can start
moving forward on business.

159
00:14:40,037 --> 00:14:42,805
All you have to do is listen.

160
00:14:44,275 --> 00:14:46,675
Yeah...

161
00:14:48,813 --> 00:14:51,597
that deal's not gonna work for us.

162
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:55,351
Fact is, I was about to ask
for all of your stuff,

163
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:59,555
only I'm thinking I don't
have to kill any of you.

164
00:14:59,557 --> 00:15:02,608
Any more of you.

165
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:33,656
Sorry, my deal is the only deal.

166
00:15:33,658 --> 00:15:35,190
We don't negotiate.

167
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,232
Me and my people are leaving.

168
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,570
Okay, friend.

169
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:51,573
Plenty of ways to get
to where you're going.

170
00:15:59,467 --> 00:16:02,184
You want to make today
your last day on Earth?

171
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,422
No,

172
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,957
but that is a good thing to bring up.

173
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,511
Think about it.

174
00:16:13,814 --> 00:16:16,598
What if it's the last day
on Earth for you?

175
00:16:17,985 --> 00:16:19,968
For someone you love?

176
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,770
What if that's true?

177
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,675
Maybe you should be extra nice

178
00:16:26,677 --> 00:16:28,711
to those people in that RV,

179
00:16:28,713 --> 00:16:30,979
'cause you never know...

180
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:33,182
Just like that.

181
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:38,087
Be kind to each other.

182
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:39,988
Like you said...

183
00:16:41,392 --> 00:16:43,859
like it was your last day on Earth.

184
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,899
You do the same.

185
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,094
Why didn't you stay back
and help guard the place?

186
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,033
I owe her.

187
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,937
Why did you come?

188
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:14,842
I owe them.

189
00:18:18,648 --> 00:18:20,781
Logrun Road's a straight shot.

190
00:18:20,783 --> 00:18:22,900
We want visibility.

191
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:28,989
There, you got it on Shelton.

192
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,458
Golf course, country
clubs, sloping terrain.

193
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,160
No bum rush from the bogeyman.

194
00:18:33,162 --> 00:18:34,962
We'd see them from a good piece.

195
00:18:34,964 --> 00:18:36,463
It is a longer trip by a third,

196
00:18:36,465 --> 00:18:38,499
but we'd get the scenic safety

197
00:18:38,501 --> 00:18:40,467
of clear-cut dingles
and glens.

198
00:18:43,072 --> 00:18:44,738
You're being serious, right?

199
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,107
As coronary thrombosis.

200
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:48,642
- You got a route?
- Yeah.

201
00:18:51,781 --> 00:18:53,180
Let's go.

202
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,201
Wasn't just me.

203
00:19:15,371 --> 00:19:17,371
Rick came looking, too.

204
00:19:18,841 --> 00:19:21,975
Daryl, some of the others...

205
00:19:23,379 --> 00:19:25,979
they would've.

206
00:19:25,981 --> 00:19:29,149
They were gone before
they even knew about you.

207
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,517
Gone?

208
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:32,186
They'll be back by the time we are.

209
00:19:32,188 --> 00:19:36,323
Probably back already, wondering.

210
00:19:36,325 --> 00:19:38,692
You think I'm being dramatic here?

211
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,780
Do you really think
you could just come here

212
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:45,332
and tell me to come back
and that's how it'll go?

213
00:19:48,871 --> 00:19:52,573
Those people, your people,

214
00:19:52,575 --> 00:19:54,074
they care about you.

215
00:19:54,076 --> 00:19:57,578
I know they do.
And I care about them.

216
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,179
That's why I can't be there.

217
00:19:59,181 --> 00:20:01,749
That's why you have to be there.

218
00:20:04,553 --> 00:20:07,221
Do you really just not get it?

219
00:20:10,226 --> 00:20:12,476
After everything that's happened.

220
00:20:17,767 --> 00:20:21,201
If you care about people,
there are people to protect,

221
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:24,655
there are people
that you will kill for.

222
00:20:26,342 --> 00:20:28,275
If you don't want to kill...

223
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:32,362
or if you can't...

224
00:20:33,949 --> 00:20:37,084
then you have to get away from them.

225
00:20:37,086 --> 00:20:38,585
You do not get both.

226
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:41,755
You-- you should know that.

227
00:20:41,757 --> 00:20:44,425
No, everything's about people.

228
00:20:45,928 --> 00:20:48,045
Everything in this life
that's worth a damn,

229
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:49,763
that's what I know.

230
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:55,219
And out here on your own...

231
00:20:57,306 --> 00:20:58,939
you'll die.

232
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,942
Then let me die.

233
00:21:01,944 --> 00:21:03,894
No, I can't do that.

234
00:21:05,214 --> 00:21:07,448
It's not your decision.
Just go.

235
00:21:09,618 --> 00:21:11,318
I'm not leaving you.

236
00:21:14,156 --> 00:21:15,989
I said go.

237
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:29,887
Please, just go.

238
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:42,432
If you care
about anyone, M--

239
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:47,955
There is a price, Morgan,
and you're gonna pay it.

240
00:21:49,525 --> 00:21:52,493
I have, and I can't anymore.

241
00:22:14,617 --> 00:22:16,133
Think we could do it?

242
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:18,552
What?

243
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:23,690
What they did, Glenn and Maggie?

244
00:22:28,531 --> 00:22:30,864
Just asking if you could do that.

245
00:22:33,302 --> 00:22:35,602
If you're doing something
as big as that...

246
00:22:38,073 --> 00:22:39,706
if that's living.

247
00:22:42,511 --> 00:22:43,794
Could you?

248
00:22:48,484 --> 00:22:49,800
Yeah.

249
00:22:52,354 --> 00:22:54,021
I could.

250
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,459
Now.

251
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,358
Just so you know.

252
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,532
Bitch nuts.

253
00:23:35,631 --> 00:23:37,631
We making our stand?

254
00:23:40,803 --> 00:23:43,520
Yeah, we end it.

255
00:23:46,642 --> 00:23:49,242
No, not now.

256
00:23:49,244 --> 00:23:52,012
They've been waiting.
They're ready.

257
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,680
With one of us behind the wheel,

258
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:58,285
that's five on 16.

259
00:23:58,287 --> 00:24:02,155
We're gonna play it our
way, how we want it.

260
00:24:02,157 --> 00:24:03,991
Right?

261
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,543
Right.

262
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:10,580
All right, go slow.

263
00:26:38,227 --> 00:26:39,760
Carol?

264
00:26:49,672 --> 00:26:51,338
Carol?

265
00:26:55,311 --> 00:26:57,845
Carol?

266
00:27:13,596 --> 00:27:14,995
Let's go.

267
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,057
How are we on gas?

268
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:44,325
Half a tank.

269
00:27:44,327 --> 00:27:46,894
I pulled some more cans
before we left.

270
00:27:46,896 --> 00:27:50,230
Those weren't the same men who
blocked the road the first time.

271
00:27:50,232 --> 00:27:53,300
Same outfit, different soldiers.

272
00:27:55,371 --> 00:27:58,072
They got numbers.

273
00:27:58,074 --> 00:28:01,175
Yeah, we keep driving,
we get her there.

274
00:28:01,177 --> 00:28:03,277
We will.

275
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:07,081
If we have to shove each and every
one of them up their own asses.

276
00:28:23,733 --> 00:28:25,566
We can't go through it.

277
00:28:25,568 --> 00:28:28,018
Can't risk the RV.

278
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,654
You stay behind the
wheel, just in case.

279
00:28:33,325 --> 00:28:35,159
We'll clear it.

280
00:28:58,601 --> 00:29:01,935
Putting together a red rover
like that takes people.

281
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,723
A lot of them.

282
00:29:19,121 --> 00:29:21,422
Come on, let's do this.

283
00:29:21,424 --> 00:29:23,657
Dad.

284
00:29:23,659 --> 00:29:25,626
That's Michonne's.

285
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:38,756
That's Daryl's.

286
00:30:15,177 --> 00:30:17,344
Get back to the RV!
Go!

287
00:30:38,567 --> 00:30:40,534
Start it up!

288
00:31:14,763 --> 00:31:16,296
What's that sound?

289
00:31:16,298 --> 00:31:18,048
Undercarriage
could've caught a bullet.

290
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:21,468
Or could be transmission.
It could be nothing.

291
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,887
They were firing at our feet.

292
00:31:25,691 --> 00:31:27,774
They blocked the road, but they
weren't trying to stop us.

293
00:31:27,776 --> 00:31:30,544
They want us in this direction.

294
00:31:30,546 --> 00:31:32,246
Barton Road takes us north,

295
00:31:32,248 --> 00:31:33,714
but they gotta know
we wanna go north.

296
00:31:33,716 --> 00:31:34,948
Meadows.

297
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,116
Could take us east a piece,

298
00:31:36,118 --> 00:31:37,651
but we can get back
on track on Mayhew.

299
00:31:37,653 --> 00:31:39,019
We're down to a third of a tank.

300
00:31:39,021 --> 00:31:40,287
We could top off at the next stop,

301
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:42,222
- but no refills after that.
- All right.

302
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,994
She's burning up.

303
00:31:56,588 --> 00:31:58,538
Rick.

304
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:16,239
Go back.

305
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:19,242
Where?

306
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,062
Whoa, whoa.

307
00:33:04,006 --> 00:33:05,572
Whoa.

308
00:33:10,979 --> 00:33:12,879
Come on.

309
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,667
No, get away.

310
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:14,574
Ah!

311
00:34:23,552 --> 00:34:25,018
Ah!

312
00:34:36,633 --> 00:34:39,167
Hey, hey.

313
00:34:39,169 --> 00:34:40,435
No, no.

314
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:57,135
Each breath is getting harder.

315
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:00,772
I probably don't have
too many more in me.

316
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,527
So I'm gonna make each one count.

317
00:35:07,113 --> 00:35:10,732
So, here's how it's gonna go.

318
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:16,104
You're gonna lie there and I'm
gonna watch you die slow,

319
00:35:16,106 --> 00:35:20,291
just like my friends did
back on that road.

320
00:35:20,293 --> 00:35:22,343
Just like I'm gonna.

321
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,881
Let's see who wins, bitch.

322
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,506
You see that?

323
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:38,159
That's a pretty good start, huh?

324
00:35:38,161 --> 00:35:39,928
Huh?

325
00:36:01,764 --> 00:36:03,430
Are we close?

326
00:36:03,432 --> 00:36:06,650
Yeah, we're--
we're getting there.

327
00:36:06,652 --> 00:36:10,271
Were there--
I heard shots.

328
00:36:10,273 --> 00:36:14,408
Yeah, the Saviors, but they're gone.

329
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,910
We are.

330
00:36:15,912 --> 00:36:19,029
We're gonna get you there.

331
00:36:19,031 --> 00:36:20,915
I know.

332
00:36:21,951 --> 00:36:24,168
You're gonna be okay.

333
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,586
The baby's gonna be okay.

334
00:36:25,588 --> 00:36:28,088
This isn't it.
This isn't it.

335
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:30,624
There's more.

336
00:36:30,626 --> 00:36:32,509
There's gonna be more.

337
00:36:33,497 --> 00:36:35,663
I believe in you, Rick.

338
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:56,151
What do you got
to smile about, bitch?

339
00:36:56,153 --> 00:36:58,153
What the hell's wrong with you?

340
00:37:00,023 --> 00:37:02,957
There's nothing wrong with me.

341
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:06,744
I'm gonna die, so...

342
00:37:06,746 --> 00:37:09,164
there's nothing wrong
with me anymore.

343
00:37:25,265 --> 00:37:28,766
You think you've suffered enough now?

344
00:37:31,354 --> 00:37:34,105
No, probably not.

345
00:37:34,107 --> 00:37:37,392
Oh, God.

346
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:50,288
What, are you done?

347
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:54,125
Unless you kill me now,
I'm not gonna die!

348
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,247
You decide!

349
00:38:02,185 --> 00:38:06,221
The world doesn't decide!
You decide!

350
00:38:06,223 --> 00:38:09,474
You don't get to walk away

351
00:38:09,476 --> 00:38:12,260
and get what you want!

352
00:38:19,736 --> 00:38:21,736
Stop.

353
00:38:25,108 --> 00:38:26,708
Drop it.

354
00:38:29,145 --> 00:38:30,712
You can survive this.

355
00:38:30,714 --> 00:38:33,581
You can.

356
00:38:35,252 --> 00:38:37,018
Drop it.

357
00:38:40,123 --> 00:38:42,674
Please.

358
00:38:42,676 --> 00:38:43,875
No.

359
00:39:02,379 --> 00:39:06,180
Would you please just let me go?

360
00:39:06,182 --> 00:39:08,316
Hey, it's not your time.

361
00:39:10,036 --> 00:39:12,587
You are gonna come back from this.

362
00:39:22,882 --> 00:39:24,666
What happened here?

363
00:39:31,057 --> 00:39:33,241
I found your horse.

364
00:39:35,478 --> 00:39:37,645
Found my friend, too.

365
00:39:39,316 --> 00:39:41,649
She needs help.

366
00:39:47,357 --> 00:39:49,290
Then let's get you some help.

367
00:40:11,598 --> 00:40:13,548
These tracks...

368
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,917
they would indicate
they not only have people,

369
00:40:15,919 --> 00:40:17,952
but some big-ass toys
and capabilities.

370
00:40:17,954 --> 00:40:20,021
What it indicates
is we are neck-deep

371
00:40:20,023 --> 00:40:23,524
up shit creek with our
mouths wide open.

372
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:33,067
- Don't.
- I can try and break the chain.

373
00:40:33,069 --> 00:40:34,369
It won't work.

374
00:40:34,371 --> 00:40:37,288
- I can try.
- It won't work.

375
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,077
And we need the bullets.

376
00:41:19,449 --> 00:41:22,867
You're treating
your people good, right?

377
00:41:22,869 --> 00:41:25,953
Like it was your last day on Earth?

378
00:41:25,955 --> 00:41:28,256
Or maybe one of theirs?

379
00:41:30,627 --> 00:41:32,260
You better go.

380
00:41:32,262 --> 00:41:34,495
It's gonna get hot.

381
00:41:34,497 --> 00:41:37,515
You go get where you're going.

382
00:41:37,517 --> 00:41:40,201
Go, go.

383
00:41:46,893 --> 00:41:48,443
Get on.

384
00:42:18,074 --> 00:42:21,843
So, what's the play?

385
00:42:21,845 --> 00:42:24,512
She needs a doctor.

386
00:42:24,514 --> 00:42:28,516
There are two more
routes north from here.

387
00:42:28,518 --> 00:42:30,985
They're probably
waiting for us right now.

388
00:42:35,658 --> 00:42:40,111
So, they're ahead of us,
probably behind us.

389
00:42:40,113 --> 00:42:43,781
But they're not
waiting on us, per se,

390
00:42:43,783 --> 00:42:46,951
they're waiting on this rust bucket.

391
00:42:46,953 --> 00:42:49,871
And they don't know the
moment-to-moment occupancy

392
00:42:49,873 --> 00:42:51,956
of said rust-bucket.

393
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:53,875
And the sun sets soon.

394
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:16,898
That's the last of it.

395
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,784
If you see a car,
try to siphon the gas.

396
00:43:19,786 --> 00:43:22,203
Other than that, you keep moving.

397
00:43:22,205 --> 00:43:24,572
I'll have them thinking
we're playing their game.

398
00:43:24,574 --> 00:43:26,958
All phases of the turn,
level after level,

399
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,126
move after move, I'll keep them spun.

400
00:43:29,128 --> 00:43:30,711
I assure you, I will.

401
00:43:33,166 --> 00:43:36,000
I got something for you.

402
00:43:36,002 --> 00:43:39,587
It's a recipe, and it ain't gazpacho.

403
00:43:43,309 --> 00:43:45,476
How to Build Bullets 101.

404
00:43:45,478 --> 00:43:48,763
Abraham can show you
where, just in case.

405
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,239
Thank you for this.

406
00:43:58,241 --> 00:44:00,358
For all of it.

407
00:44:02,612 --> 00:44:05,413
We're lucky you're here.

408
00:44:05,415 --> 00:44:07,715
I won't argue with that.

409
00:44:13,323 --> 00:44:15,289
You go steady on the pedal.

410
00:44:15,291 --> 00:44:17,058
You don't make that thing gulp.

411
00:44:19,028 --> 00:44:21,429
How come you never
let me drive the truck?

412
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:28,552
I didn't think you could do it.

413
00:44:31,609 --> 00:44:34,142
I was wrong.

414
00:44:34,144 --> 00:44:36,478
You're a survivor.

415
00:44:37,815 --> 00:44:41,033
You always were.

416
00:44:41,035 --> 00:44:43,619
We just didn't know it.

417
00:44:46,156 --> 00:44:48,323
Me and you both.

418
00:45:17,571 --> 00:45:19,571
Thank you.

419
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:35,366
Aaron, please.

420
00:46:35,368 --> 00:46:37,919
Just let me walk it.

421
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:40,038
Relax.

422
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,590
Just a few more miles.

423
00:46:44,161 --> 00:46:47,212
I heard what you told
her when we were leaving.

424
00:46:49,833 --> 00:46:52,083
We can do anything,

425
00:46:52,085 --> 00:46:55,003
'cause we'll do
anything we need to do.

426
00:46:55,005 --> 00:46:58,423
We have and we will.

427
00:47:01,978 --> 00:47:03,928
What happened to Denise,

428
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:06,514
I'm not gonna let anybody
die like that again.

429
00:47:09,319 --> 00:47:11,152
- Son...
- What?

430
00:47:26,169 --> 00:47:28,119
Go! Go!

431
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:51,309
Ah!

432
00:49:06,186 --> 00:49:07,969
Good.

433
00:49:08,888 --> 00:49:10,388
You made it.

434
00:49:12,225 --> 00:49:14,058
Welcome to where you're going.

435
00:49:18,615 --> 00:49:21,900
We'll take your weapons.

436
00:49:21,902 --> 00:49:23,484
Now.

437
00:49:27,908 --> 00:49:31,576
- We can talk about--
- We're done talking.

438
00:49:31,578 --> 00:49:33,628
Time to listen.

439
00:49:54,017 --> 00:49:55,934
That's yours, right?

440
00:49:58,104 --> 00:50:01,990
Yeah, it's yours.

441
00:50:07,414 --> 00:50:10,448
Okay.

442
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:13,618
Let's get her down and get
you all on your knees.

443
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:17,338
Lots to cover.

444
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:19,123
Hold up.

445
00:50:19,243 --> 00:50:21,001
We got it.

446
00:50:21,121 --> 00:50:23,962
Sure, sure.

447
00:50:59,215 --> 00:51:01,332
Gonna need you on your knees.

448
00:51:46,943 --> 00:51:48,910
- Dwight!
- Yeah.

449
00:51:48,912 --> 00:51:50,395
Chop-chop.

450
00:51:57,904 --> 00:51:59,237
Come on.

451
00:51:59,239 --> 00:52:01,322
You got people to meet.

452
00:52:18,341 --> 00:52:20,642
Maggie?

453
00:52:20,644 --> 00:52:22,677
On your knees!

454
00:52:31,438 --> 00:52:33,271
All right!

455
00:52:33,273 --> 00:52:35,356
We got a full boat.

456
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:38,693
Let's meet the man.

457
00:52:57,547 --> 00:52:59,798
Pissing our pants yet?

458
00:53:04,938 --> 00:53:09,023
Boy, do I have a feeling
we're getting close.

459
00:53:15,949 --> 00:53:18,533
Yep.

460
00:53:18,535 --> 00:53:22,070
It's gonna be pee-pee pants
city here real soon.

461
00:53:25,075 --> 00:53:28,543
Which one of you pricks
is the leader?

462
00:53:28,545 --> 00:53:29,744
It's this one.

463
00:53:32,048 --> 00:53:33,998
He's the guy.

464
00:53:45,095 --> 00:53:46,728
Hi.

465
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:48,980
You're Rick, right?

466
00:53:48,982 --> 00:53:51,649
I'm Negan.

467
00:53:51,651 --> 00:53:55,320
And I do not appreciate
you killing my men.

468
00:53:55,322 --> 00:53:58,323
Also, when I sent my people

469
00:53:58,325 --> 00:54:01,276
to kill your people
for killing my people,

470
00:54:01,278 --> 00:54:03,778
you killed more of my people.

471
00:54:05,615 --> 00:54:08,583
Not cool.

472
00:54:08,585 --> 00:54:10,251
Not cool.

473
00:54:10,253 --> 00:54:13,755
You have no idea

474
00:54:13,757 --> 00:54:15,790
how not cool that shit is.

475
00:54:15,792 --> 00:54:19,961
But I think you're gonna
be up to speed shortly.

476
00:54:23,016 --> 00:54:24,465
Yeah.

477
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:29,721
You are so gonna regret
crossing me in a few minutes.

478
00:54:32,442 --> 00:54:34,275
Yes, you are.

479
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:39,981
You see, Rick, whatever you do,

480
00:54:39,983 --> 00:54:43,284
no matter what, you don't mess
with the new world order.

481
00:54:43,286 --> 00:54:46,321
And the new world order is this,
and it's really very simple.

482
00:54:46,323 --> 00:54:49,908
So, even if you're stupid,
which you very may well be,

483
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:52,544
you can understand it.

484
00:54:52,546 --> 00:54:54,796
You ready?

485
00:54:54,798 --> 00:54:58,499
Here goes.
Pay attention.

486
00:55:06,676 --> 00:55:09,677
Give me your shit...

487
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:11,679
or I will kill you.

488
00:55:16,219 --> 00:55:18,319
Today was career day.

489
00:55:19,856 --> 00:55:21,773
We invested a lot

490
00:55:21,775 --> 00:55:26,611
so you would know who I am
and what I can do.

491
00:55:28,248 --> 00:55:31,032
You work for me now.

492
00:55:31,034 --> 00:55:34,369
You have shit, you give it to me.

493
00:55:34,371 --> 00:55:36,454
That's your job.

494
00:55:37,874 --> 00:55:42,343
Now, I know that is a mighty big,

495
00:55:42,345 --> 00:55:45,129
nasty pill to swallow,

496
00:55:45,131 --> 00:55:50,468
but swallow it
you most certainly will.

497
00:55:54,641 --> 00:55:56,190
You ruled the roost.

498
00:55:56,192 --> 00:56:00,478
You built something.

499
00:56:02,365 --> 00:56:04,699
You thought you were safe.

500
00:56:04,701 --> 00:56:07,735
I get it.

501
00:56:07,737 --> 00:56:11,456
But the word is out.

502
00:56:12,909 --> 00:56:16,411
You are not safe.

503
00:56:18,164 --> 00:56:20,248
Not even close.

504
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:22,750
In fact, you are pegged,

505
00:56:22,752 --> 00:56:24,752
more pegged if you don't
do what I want.

506
00:56:24,754 --> 00:56:27,472
And what I want is half your shit.

507
00:56:27,474 --> 00:56:30,842
And if that's too much, you can
make, find, or steal more,

508
00:56:30,844 --> 00:56:33,428
and it'll even out sooner or later.

509
00:56:35,932 --> 00:56:39,567
This is your way of life now.

510
00:56:39,569 --> 00:56:43,738
The more you fight back,
the harder it will be.

511
00:56:44,774 --> 00:56:49,110
So, if someone knocks on your door...

512
00:56:51,948 --> 00:56:53,247
...you let us in.

513
00:56:53,249 --> 00:56:56,284
We own that door.

514
00:56:56,286 --> 00:56:58,586
You try to stop us

515
00:56:58,588 --> 00:57:02,006
and we will knock it down.

516
00:57:04,461 --> 00:57:06,627
You understand?

517
00:57:09,799 --> 00:57:12,467
What, no answer?

518
00:57:16,139 --> 00:57:19,307
You don't really think that you
were gonna get through this

519
00:57:19,309 --> 00:57:21,642
without being punished, now, did you?

520
00:57:23,646 --> 00:57:25,863
I don't want to kill you people.

521
00:57:25,865 --> 00:57:28,366
Just want to make that
clear from the get-go.

522
00:57:29,486 --> 00:57:31,819
I want you to work for me.

523
00:57:31,821 --> 00:57:35,823
You can't do that if
you're dead, now, can you?

524
00:57:38,995 --> 00:57:41,996
I'm not growing a garden.

525
00:57:44,918 --> 00:57:49,554
But you killed my people,
a whole damn lot of them.

526
00:57:49,556 --> 00:57:51,756
More than I'm comfortable with.

527
00:57:51,758 --> 00:57:55,543
And for that, for that
you're gonna pay.

528
00:57:59,482 --> 00:58:01,616
So, now...

529
00:58:05,071 --> 00:58:09,190
I'm gonna beat the holy hell
outta one of you.

530
00:58:15,615 --> 00:58:18,032
This--

531
00:58:18,034 --> 00:58:20,668
this is Lucille,

532
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:25,123
and she is awesome.

533
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:36,551
All this, all this
is just so we can pick out

534
00:58:36,553 --> 00:58:40,104
which one of you gets the honor.

535
00:58:54,037 --> 00:58:55,703
Huh.

536
00:58:56,990 --> 00:58:59,207
Ugh, I gotta shave this shit.

537
00:59:05,799 --> 00:59:08,800
You got one of our guns.

538
00:59:12,388 --> 00:59:15,590
Whoa. Yeah.

539
00:59:15,592 --> 00:59:17,925
You got a lot of our guns.

540
00:59:21,264 --> 00:59:25,233
Shit, kid, lighten up.

541
00:59:26,853 --> 00:59:29,103
At least cry a little.

542
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:39,363
Ahem.

543
00:59:47,423 --> 00:59:49,790
Jesus.

544
00:59:49,792 --> 00:59:52,543
You look shitty.

545
00:59:54,347 --> 00:59:56,180
I should just put you
out of your misery right now.

546
00:59:56,182 --> 00:59:58,850
No! No!

547
00:59:58,852 --> 01:00:01,435
Stop it!

548
01:00:01,437 --> 01:00:05,523
God--!

549
01:00:05,525 --> 01:00:07,441
Nope.

550
01:00:07,443 --> 01:00:10,945
- Nope, get him back in line.
- No.

551
01:00:10,947 --> 01:00:13,731
No.

552
01:00:13,733 --> 01:00:14,982
No.

553
01:00:24,661 --> 01:00:26,911
Don't.

554
01:00:26,913 --> 01:00:28,379
Don't.

555
01:00:31,084 --> 01:00:33,801
All right, listen.

556
01:00:33,803 --> 01:00:37,755
Don't any of you do that again.

557
01:00:37,757 --> 01:00:41,425
I will shut that shit down,
no exceptions.

558
01:00:43,346 --> 01:00:44,812
First one's free.

559
01:00:44,814 --> 01:00:49,016
It's an emotional moment, I get it.

560
01:01:03,833 --> 01:01:06,367
Sucks, don't it?

561
01:01:06,369 --> 01:01:10,204
The moment you realize
you don't know shit.

562
01:01:25,188 --> 01:01:27,638
This is your kid, right?

563
01:01:32,228 --> 01:01:34,629
This is definitely your kid.

564
01:01:34,631 --> 01:01:37,782
- Just stop this!
- Hey!

565
01:01:37,784 --> 01:01:41,702
Do not make me kill the
little future serial killer.

566
01:01:41,704 --> 01:01:43,788
Don't make it easy on me.

567
01:01:45,742 --> 01:01:48,576
I gotta pick somebody.

568
01:01:48,578 --> 01:01:52,330
Everybody's at the table
waiting for me to order.

569
01:02:11,401 --> 01:02:14,568
I simply cannot decide.

570
01:02:20,743 --> 01:02:22,943
I got an idea.

571
01:02:31,037 --> 01:02:32,703
Eenie...

572
01:02:34,624 --> 01:02:36,374
meenie...

573
01:02:36,376 --> 01:02:38,459
miney...

574
01:02:40,763 --> 01:02:42,797
mo...

575
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:46,384
catch...

576
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,937
a tiger...

577
01:02:49,939 --> 01:02:52,690
by...

578
01:02:52,692 --> 01:02:54,775
his toe.

579
01:02:54,777 --> 01:02:57,061
If...

580
01:02:57,063 --> 01:03:00,314
he hollers...

581
01:03:00,316 --> 01:03:02,316
let him go.

582
01:03:04,037 --> 01:03:06,203
My mother...

583
01:03:06,205 --> 01:03:07,388
told me...

584
01:03:07,390 --> 01:03:08,873
to pick

585
01:03:08,875 --> 01:03:13,244
the very best one...

586
01:03:13,246 --> 01:03:15,996
and you...

587
01:03:17,383 --> 01:03:20,000
are...

588
01:03:27,593 --> 01:03:29,977
it.

589
01:03:29,979 --> 01:03:32,012
Anybody moves, anybody says anything,

590
01:03:32,014 --> 01:03:34,682
cut the boy's other eye out
and feed it to his father

591
01:03:34,684 --> 01:03:36,734
and then we'll start.

592
01:03:36,736 --> 01:03:38,269
You can breathe,

593
01:03:38,271 --> 01:03:39,987
you can blink,

594
01:03:39,989 --> 01:03:42,073
you can cry.

595
01:03:42,075 --> 01:03:45,493
Hell, you're all gonna be doing that.

596
01:03:46,529 --> 01:03:50,698
Ho! Ho!

597
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:53,617
Look at that.

598
01:03:53,619 --> 01:03:56,837
Taking it like a champ!

599
01:03:58,941 --> 01:04:01,742
Damn!
