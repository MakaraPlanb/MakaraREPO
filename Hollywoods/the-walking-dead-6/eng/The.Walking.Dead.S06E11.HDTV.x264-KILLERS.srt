00:00:00,266 --> 00:00:03,210
<i>Previously, on
AMC's "The Walking Dead..."</i>

2
00:00:03,524 --> 00:00:06,141
I mapped out some of the
agricultural supply places

3
00:00:06,261 --> 00:00:07,894
<i>in the area.</i>

4
00:00:08,855 --> 00:00:10,622
- What's your name?
- Call me Jesus.

5
00:00:10,724 --> 00:00:12,491
<i>He swiped your keys, didn't he?</i>

6
00:00:24,237 --> 00:00:25,536
<i>Rick, wake up!</i>

7
00:00:27,765 --> 00:00:30,037
We should talk.

8
00:00:30,503 --> 00:00:32,207
<i>So there we were,</i>

9
00:00:32,327 --> 00:00:35,313
<i>scraping our sacks
in the sandbox.</i>

10
00:00:35,315 --> 00:00:37,247
<i>Open targets in the dunes.</i>

11
00:00:37,249 --> 00:00:39,850
<i>All of us sweating and swearing.</i>

12
00:00:39,852 --> 00:00:43,253
Sure as hell beat sitting on
our asses 30 clicks to nowhere

13
00:00:43,255 --> 00:00:44,655
waiting for
our humpbacked friend

14
00:00:44,657 --> 00:00:47,224
to defecate the keys
to our transport.

15
00:00:47,226 --> 00:00:48,826
<i>Camels don't eat keys.</i>

16
00:00:48,828 --> 00:00:50,795
They do, it did.

17
00:00:50,797 --> 00:00:53,430
And it shit it out.

18
00:00:53,432 --> 00:00:56,333
I shit you not.

19
00:00:56,335 --> 00:00:57,835
You're an idiot.

20
00:00:57,837 --> 00:00:59,837
I've never denied it.

21
00:01:05,644 --> 00:01:07,311
Brave new world.

22
00:01:09,514 --> 00:01:13,049
I still can't stop thinking
about Maggie having a pup.

23
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:14,451
In this.

24
00:01:14,453 --> 00:01:16,319
What about it?

25
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:18,888
You know, the way things go.

26
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,657
The way they can.

27
00:01:22,894 --> 00:01:25,061
Yeah.

28
00:01:25,063 --> 00:01:26,595
Maybe that's why.

29
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:30,132
Because the way things go.

30
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:36,205
Uh...

31
00:01:39,878 --> 00:01:42,411
You already called me an idiot.

32
00:01:42,413 --> 00:01:44,380
Never had to.

33
00:01:44,382 --> 00:01:46,815
Yeah.

34
00:01:51,355 --> 00:01:53,655
I'll see you tomorrow.

35
00:01:53,657 --> 00:01:55,691
<i>Nope.</i>

36
00:01:55,693 --> 00:01:57,826
I'm, uh,

37
00:01:57,828 --> 00:02:00,362
starting a new shift.

38
00:02:00,364 --> 00:02:02,931
The watch post on Baggarly.

39
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:06,601
That so?

40
00:02:06,603 --> 00:02:08,836
Yeah, I already
talked to Eugene.

41
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:10,338
He wants to help out more.

42
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,108
Said he'd take over
my patrol with you.

43
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,843
Uh...

44
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:17,211
how about that?

45
00:02:17,213 --> 00:02:19,346
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

46
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:20,848
How about that?

47
00:02:23,553 --> 00:02:25,119
Um...

48
00:02:26,289 --> 00:02:27,922
see you around?

49
00:02:27,924 --> 00:02:29,457
Yeah.

50
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:35,062
Yeah.

51
00:02:35,064 --> 00:02:36,931
See you around, Abraham.

52
00:02:51,513 --> 00:02:52,679
Hey.

53
00:02:55,116 --> 00:02:57,517
Hey, Abraham.

54
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,885
<i>Hey.</i>

55
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,220
You're still here?

56
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:09,963
You know Eugene's
gonna start patrolling?

57
00:03:09,965 --> 00:03:12,131
Mm-hmm.

58
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:15,801
He asked me to teach him how
to fieldstrip automatics.

59
00:03:15,803 --> 00:03:18,338
He's gonna teach me chemistry.

60
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,806
Mm.

61
00:03:20,808 --> 00:03:22,675
You can't teach chemistry.

62
00:03:22,677 --> 00:03:25,344
- Really?
- Mm-mm.

63
00:03:33,153 --> 00:03:36,021
Sweet flaming mercy.

64
00:03:37,757 --> 00:03:41,693
That was just... beyond.

65
00:03:41,695 --> 00:03:43,628
Mm-hmm.
Oh, yeah?

66
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,003
Mm.

67
00:04:00,446 --> 00:04:01,646
Catch.

68
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,720
<i>It's from the fuel truck.</i>

69
00:04:08,722 --> 00:04:10,454
<i>Had to crack a brake light.</i>

70
00:04:12,558 --> 00:04:14,492
You made this?

71
00:04:14,494 --> 00:04:16,560
Thought your neck
looked a little lonely.

72
00:04:16,562 --> 00:04:19,430
<i>Rosita Espinosa,</i>

73
00:04:19,432 --> 00:04:23,067
you are damn near
perfection, you know that?

74
00:04:29,675 --> 00:04:31,274
Show me.

75
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:39,583
In the shower.

76
00:04:39,585 --> 00:04:41,251
<i>In a minute.</i>

77
00:05:03,307 --> 00:05:05,374
Maggie.

78
00:05:05,376 --> 00:05:07,109
Hey.

79
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,747
We get the trellises in, we
can start going vertically.

80
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:14,550
Double our yield of
tomatoes per square foot.

81
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,287
We can only keep stretching
our rations so far.

82
00:05:23,294 --> 00:05:25,794
Still haven't seen a single bud.

83
00:05:27,364 --> 00:05:29,831
Babe.

84
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,334
It'll grow.

85
00:05:32,336 --> 00:05:34,769
We're gonna be okay.

86
00:06:00,796 --> 00:06:03,131
What the hell are you
doing in our house?

87
00:06:05,101 --> 00:06:07,735
I'm, uh, sitting on the steps

88
00:06:07,737 --> 00:06:10,070
looking at this painting,

89
00:06:10,072 --> 00:06:13,473
waiting for your mom
and dad to get dressed.

90
00:06:13,475 --> 00:06:15,075
Hi...

91
00:06:15,077 --> 00:06:16,376
I'm Jesus.

92
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:21,749
Carl, hey, um...

93
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:27,587
It's-- it's okay.

94
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,024
<i>You said we should talk.</i>

95
00:06:31,026 --> 00:06:34,561
So let's talk.

96
00:06:34,563 --> 00:06:37,397
So, how'd you get out?

97
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:39,398
One guard can't cover two exits

98
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,668
<i>or third floor windows.</i>

99
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,836
<i>Knots untie
and locks get picked.</i>

100
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:46,305
- Entropy comes from order, right?
- Right.

101
00:06:48,143 --> 00:06:50,576
I checked out your arsenal.

102
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:52,578
I haven't seen anything
like that in a long time.

103
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,882
You're well-equipped, but
your provisions are low.

104
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:59,051
Very low for the amount
of people you have.

105
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:01,953
- 54?
- More than that.

106
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:06,358
Well, I appreciate the cookie.

107
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,526
My compliments to the chef.

108
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:09,094
Yeah, she ain't here.

109
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:13,531
Look, we got off to a bad start.

110
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:17,069
But we're on the same side--
the living side.

111
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,472
You and Rick had every reason
to leave me out there,

112
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,241
but you didn't.

113
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:26,812
I'm from a place
that's a lot like this one.

114
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:30,448
Part of my job is searching out
other settlements to trade with.

115
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,419
I took your truck because
my community needs things,

116
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:37,388
and both of you
looked like trouble.

117
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,557
I was wrong.

118
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,226
You're good people.

119
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:43,661
And this is a good place.

120
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:46,330
I think our communities may be in
a position to help each other.

121
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:47,832
Do you have food?

122
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,566
We've started
to raise livestock.

123
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:51,736
We scavenge, we grow.

124
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:53,637
Everything from
tomatoes to sorghum.

125
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,706
Tell us why we should
believe you.

126
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,041
I'll show you.

127
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,376
If we take a car, I can take
you back home in a day,

128
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:02,746
and you can all see for yourselves who
we are and what we have to offer.

129
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:06,850
Wait, you're looking
for<i> more</i> settlements.

130
00:08:06,852 --> 00:08:09,286
You mean you're already
trading with other groups?

131
00:08:13,325 --> 00:08:15,659
Your world's about to get
a whole lot bigger.

132
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:52,783

133
00:09:00,376 --> 00:09:01,804
Here.

134
00:09:02,044 --> 00:09:03,811
Homemade oat cake.

135
00:09:03,813 --> 00:09:06,180
Complex carbohydrates,
omega-3s.

136
00:09:06,182 --> 00:09:08,483
Nah, I'm good.

137
00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:12,620
We're gonna make a pit stop.
I'll pick up something then.

138
00:09:12,622 --> 00:09:14,321
Like rabies?

139
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:19,460
Is this 'cause I tried
to get you that stuff?

140
00:09:19,462 --> 00:09:22,062
Yeah.

141
00:09:22,064 --> 00:09:24,231
And you remind me
of someone I used to know.

142
00:09:27,803 --> 00:09:29,370
Well...

143
00:09:29,372 --> 00:09:31,338
I hope it tastes
better than it looks.

144
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,272
'Cause it looks like shit.

145
00:09:33,274 --> 00:09:35,809
Shit's still better
than roadkill.

146
00:09:35,811 --> 00:09:38,311
Okay, maybe--
just eat it.

147
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,853
You sure?

148
00:09:46,855 --> 00:09:48,889
No.

149
00:09:48,891 --> 00:09:50,556
But if he's telling the truth,

150
00:09:50,558 --> 00:09:53,226
this could be
the start of everything.

151
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,966
Look, I was gonna tell you
about me and Michonne,

152
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:02,835
but it just happened.

153
00:10:02,837 --> 00:10:05,238
It<i> just</i> happened.

154
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,139
Last night.

155
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:14,713
This is--
this is different.

156
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:18,017
It's cool.

157
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:20,385
All right.

158
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:23,321
Well, get your stuff.

159
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,690
Gabriel can take care
of Judith while we're gone.

160
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:27,526
No, I'm not coming.

161
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:32,630
Someone's gotta stay back,
keep this place safe.

162
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,366
A kid with a messed-up face
probably wouldn't make

163
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:36,501
the best first
impression anyway.

164
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,550
Let's chew up some asphalt!

165
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:25,649
Hey.

166
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:29,719
Can I ask you a question?

167
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:31,821
Sure.

168
00:11:37,795 --> 00:11:42,765
When you were, uh,
pouring the Bisquick,

169
00:11:42,767 --> 00:11:44,300
were you trying
to make pancakes?

170
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:48,004
Uh...

171
00:11:48,006 --> 00:11:49,672
yes?

172
00:11:51,442 --> 00:11:53,809
Oh, okay, um...

173
00:11:55,479 --> 00:11:58,981
it's something that
we talked about, yeah.

174
00:11:58,983 --> 00:12:00,249
- Yeah.
- Why?

175
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:02,451
No, I just...

176
00:12:04,021 --> 00:12:07,922
Well, given the precarious

177
00:12:07,924 --> 00:12:11,793
state of affairs
on any given Sunday,

178
00:12:11,795 --> 00:12:15,063
I am damn near floored
that you or anyone else

179
00:12:15,065 --> 00:12:17,266
would have the<i> cojones</i>
to make a call like that.

180
00:12:17,268 --> 00:12:20,135
I mean, well...

181
00:12:20,137 --> 00:12:24,405
we're trying to build
something, me and her.

182
00:12:24,407 --> 00:12:26,141
All of us.

183
00:12:29,646 --> 00:12:31,579
For the record,

184
00:12:31,581 --> 00:12:33,982
I see rain coming,
I'm wearing galoshes.

185
00:12:37,353 --> 00:12:38,819
I double up.

186
00:13:00,576 --> 00:13:02,810
Yo, Rick.
What's going on?

187
00:13:02,812 --> 00:13:04,945
We got a crash ahead.

188
00:13:04,947 --> 00:13:06,880
<i>Looks like it just happened.</i>

189
00:13:10,852 --> 00:13:12,452
It's one of ours.

190
00:13:33,507 --> 00:13:36,876
If this is a trick,
it won't end well for you.

191
00:13:36,878 --> 00:13:38,410
My people are in trouble.

192
00:13:38,412 --> 00:13:42,047
They don't-- we don't
have a lot of fighters.

193
00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:45,384
I know how it looks,
but I'll play it out.

194
00:13:45,386 --> 00:13:46,652
Can I borrow a gun?

195
00:13:46,654 --> 00:13:48,254
No.

196
00:13:48,256 --> 00:13:50,088
We got tracks right here.

197
00:13:53,961 --> 00:13:55,827
<i>They gotta be in there.</i>

198
00:13:58,165 --> 00:14:00,065
We moving in or what?

199
00:14:00,067 --> 00:14:02,433
How do we know this ain't
firecrackers in a trash can?

200
00:14:02,435 --> 00:14:03,869
You don't.

201
00:14:03,871 --> 00:14:06,671
We'll get your people.

202
00:14:06,673 --> 00:14:08,840
You're staying here
with one of us.

203
00:14:10,744 --> 00:14:12,210
That's the deal.

204
00:14:12,212 --> 00:14:14,345
- Will you stay?
- Yeah.

205
00:14:14,347 --> 00:14:16,447
<i>Y'all go.
Just be careful.</i>

206
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:17,782
Yeah.

207
00:14:17,784 --> 00:14:20,084
We're gonna be careful.

208
00:14:20,086 --> 00:14:22,219
Just hurry.

209
00:14:23,423 --> 00:14:25,923
You hear me whistle, shoot him.

210
00:14:25,925 --> 00:14:27,759
I will.

211
00:15:12,397 --> 00:15:14,764
Come on out.
We're not gonna hurt you.

212
00:15:14,766 --> 00:15:17,469
We're friends of Jesus.
We're here to get you out.

213
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:19,768
- There more of you?
- Two more. They ran ahead.

214
00:15:40,455 --> 00:15:42,090
Come on.

215
00:15:42,092 --> 00:15:44,092
We're with Jesus.
Let's go.

216
00:15:44,094 --> 00:15:46,562
I can't go with you.
I'm looking for my friend.

217
00:15:46,564 --> 00:15:49,431
He's close, and he's
hurt from the crash.

218
00:16:07,084 --> 00:16:09,650
No!

219
00:16:09,652 --> 00:16:11,819
<i>Come on, man, let's go.</i>

220
00:16:11,821 --> 00:16:13,420
Come on!

221
00:16:13,422 --> 00:16:14,956
- You got him?
- Go.

222
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,024
Come on.
Come on.

223
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:32,306
<i>Name's Harlan, by the way.</i>

224
00:16:32,308 --> 00:16:33,507
Maggie.

225
00:16:36,378 --> 00:16:39,246
That's my husband, Glenn.

226
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,780
<i>We're bringing
back medication,</i>

227
00:16:40,782 --> 00:16:44,350
so you may have saved more people
than just us back there, Glenn.

228
00:16:46,154 --> 00:16:49,555
- You're a doctor?
- Yeah, that's right.

229
00:16:49,557 --> 00:16:52,025
You have any prenatal
vitamins in there?

230
00:16:56,698 --> 00:16:59,532
- For you?
- Mm-hmm.

231
00:16:59,534 --> 00:17:04,036
Well, uh, I was
an obstetrician before,

232
00:17:04,038 --> 00:17:06,439
and I most definitely owe you.

233
00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:09,908
So, I'd say you two
just hit the jackpot.

234
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:24,456
You okay, Freddie?

235
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,863
For a second back there,

236
00:17:31,865 --> 00:17:34,566
just when I thought
he was gonna...

237
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:38,936
<i>I saw my wife.</i>

238
00:17:38,938 --> 00:17:41,873
<i>She died before all this.</i>

239
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,576
Just when I thought it was over,

240
00:17:44,578 --> 00:17:45,943
there she was.

241
00:17:48,048 --> 00:17:50,114
Clear as day.

242
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,204
Damn it.

243
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:18,542
A storm must've passed through.

244
00:18:18,544 --> 00:18:20,476
We're stuck.

245
00:18:20,478 --> 00:18:23,847
No worries.
We're here.

246
00:18:37,362 --> 00:18:39,962
That's us.

247
00:18:39,964 --> 00:18:41,497
That's the Hilltop.

248
00:19:17,404 --> 00:19:19,091
<i>Stop right there.</i>

249
00:19:19,211 --> 00:19:21,173
- Whoa!
- You gonna make us?

250
00:19:21,175 --> 00:19:22,541
Jesus, what the hell is this?

251
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:26,702
Open the gates, Cal.
Freddie's hurt.

252
00:19:26,704 --> 00:19:28,070
Look, sorry about these guys.

253
00:19:28,072 --> 00:19:29,905
They get antsy standing up there

254
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:30,907
all day doing nothing.

255
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,701
They give up the weapons.
Then we'll open the gates.

256
00:19:33,703 --> 00:19:35,169
Why don't you come
down here and get 'em?

257
00:19:35,171 --> 00:19:37,638
Gentlemen, look, we vouch for
these people, all right?

258
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,239
They saved us out there.

259
00:19:39,241 --> 00:19:41,541
<i>Lower the spears.</i>

260
00:19:41,543 --> 00:19:42,710
Look, I'm not
taking any chances.

261
00:19:42,712 --> 00:19:44,612
Tell your guy Gregory
to come out here.

262
00:19:44,614 --> 00:19:45,980
No.

263
00:19:45,982 --> 00:19:48,882
Don't you see
what just happened?

264
00:19:48,884 --> 00:19:51,919
I'm letting you keep your guns.

265
00:19:51,921 --> 00:19:54,554
Look, we ran out
of ammo months ago.

266
00:19:56,091 --> 00:19:57,991
I like you people.

267
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,627
I trust you.

268
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,163
Trust us.

269
00:20:17,578 --> 00:20:19,578
Open the gates, Cal.

270
00:20:55,549 --> 00:20:58,650
Hey, thanks again.

271
00:20:58,652 --> 00:21:02,387
Come see me whenever. I'm just over
here in the medical trailer, okay?

272
00:21:19,005 --> 00:21:22,506
There was a materials yard
for a power company nearby.

273
00:21:22,508 --> 00:21:24,241
That's how we put up the walls.

274
00:21:25,777 --> 00:21:28,212
<i>A lot of people came
from a FEMA camp.</i>

275
00:21:28,214 --> 00:21:30,414
<i>Trailers came with them.</i>

276
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,683
How did people find
out about this place?

277
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:36,786
That's called Barrington House.

278
00:21:36,788 --> 00:21:40,023
The family that owned it gave
it to the state in the '30s.

279
00:21:40,025 --> 00:21:44,127
The state turned it into
a living history museum.

280
00:21:44,129 --> 00:21:48,631
<i>Every elementary school for 50 miles
used to come here for field trips.</i>

281
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:53,002
The place was running a long time before
the modern world built up around it.

282
00:21:53,004 --> 00:21:55,338
I think people came here
because they figured

283
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,440
it'd keep running after
the modern world broke down.

284
00:21:59,244 --> 00:22:02,878
Those windows up there let us see
for miles in every direction.

285
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,647
It's perfect for security.

286
00:22:04,649 --> 00:22:07,750
Come on.
I'll show you inside.

287
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:34,576
Good gracious, Ignatius.

288
00:22:34,578 --> 00:22:37,018
<i> Most of the rooms have
been converted to living spaces.</i>

289
00:22:38,214 --> 00:22:40,382
Even the ones
that weren't bedrooms.

290
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,950
People live here
and the trailers?

291
00:22:42,952 --> 00:22:45,686
We plan to build.

292
00:22:45,688 --> 00:22:47,288
There's babies being born.

293
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,992
Jesus.

294
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,927
You're back.

295
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:56,030
With guests.

296
00:22:56,032 --> 00:22:59,033
<i>Everyone, this is Gregory.</i>

297
00:22:59,035 --> 00:23:01,034
<i>He keeps the trains
running on time around here.</i>

298
00:23:01,036 --> 00:23:03,537
I'm the boss.

299
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:06,006
Well, I'm Rick.
We have a community--

300
00:23:06,008 --> 00:23:08,676
Why don't y'all
go get cleaned up, hmm?

301
00:23:12,581 --> 00:23:14,448
We're fine.

302
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,117
Jesus will show you where
you can get washed up.

303
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,952
Then come back down here
when you're ready.

304
00:23:20,488 --> 00:23:22,989
It's hard to keep
this place clean.

305
00:23:24,092 --> 00:23:26,293
Yeah. Sure.

306
00:23:29,664 --> 00:23:31,798
Follow me.

307
00:23:38,172 --> 00:23:41,040
You clean up first.
You talk to him.

308
00:23:41,042 --> 00:23:42,575
Why?

309
00:23:42,577 --> 00:23:44,577
I shouldn't.

310
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:46,612
And you gotta start
doing these things.

311
00:24:12,406 --> 00:24:15,574
How long do you think Rick and
Michonne been ugging bumplies?

312
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:17,909
I don't know.

313
00:24:20,213 --> 00:24:21,946
You ever think about it?

314
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,549
Settling down?

315
00:24:27,787 --> 00:24:29,354
You think shit's settled?

316
00:24:48,775 --> 00:24:50,307
Gregory.

317
00:24:50,309 --> 00:24:52,476
- Natalie, right?
- Maggie.

318
00:24:52,478 --> 00:24:54,111
That's pretty close.

319
00:24:54,113 --> 00:24:56,013
Not really.

320
00:24:56,015 --> 00:24:59,682
She calls them like she sees them.
I like that.

321
00:24:59,684 --> 00:25:01,285
Come in, let's chat.

322
00:25:08,127 --> 00:25:09,559
<i>Yeah.</i>

323
00:25:09,561 --> 00:25:12,862
I-- I came to this
place once before,

324
00:25:12,864 --> 00:25:14,697
when it was a museum,

325
00:25:14,699 --> 00:25:17,834
this, um, Chamber
of Commerce thing.

326
00:25:20,071 --> 00:25:23,172
Love that painting.

327
00:25:23,174 --> 00:25:26,543
I never figured it'd be mine,

328
00:25:26,545 --> 00:25:28,777
here it is.

329
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:31,948
It's like it was waiting
for me the whole time.

330
00:25:35,153 --> 00:25:36,352
Hmm.

331
00:25:42,726 --> 00:25:45,961
Jesus told me your group saved Dr.
Carson.

332
00:25:45,963 --> 00:25:48,464
Obviously, a doctor's
a rare commodity today,

333
00:25:48,466 --> 00:25:50,432
so I want to thank you
for bringing ours back.

334
00:25:50,434 --> 00:25:52,468
My husband saved him.

335
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,736
I'll be sure to thank him, too.

336
00:25:54,738 --> 00:25:57,739
This place, what you have here,

337
00:25:57,741 --> 00:25:59,140
has been here since the start?

338
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:00,442
That's right.

339
00:26:00,444 --> 00:26:04,212
And how-- how is it--
how have you survived here?

340
00:26:04,214 --> 00:26:07,882
You're looking at how.
I'm good at this.

341
00:26:07,884 --> 00:26:10,785
And I don't get
hung up on the details.

342
00:26:10,787 --> 00:26:13,455
<i>Where you live, is it as
nice as the Hilltop Colony?</i>

343
00:26:13,457 --> 00:26:14,889
It's just different.

344
00:26:14,891 --> 00:26:16,291
<i>How do you feed everyone?</i>

345
00:26:16,293 --> 00:26:19,426
Jesus said you had land
for gardens, but no crops.

346
00:26:19,428 --> 00:26:21,061
We just started planting.

347
00:26:21,063 --> 00:26:23,364
- Planting what?
- Cucumbers, tomatoes.

348
00:26:23,366 --> 00:26:27,668
Oh, crops-- soy,
corn, hemp, sorghum.

349
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,737
- Garden stuff.
- But you have guns,

350
00:26:29,739 --> 00:26:31,873
so I assume you have
a decent weapons cache.

351
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:33,875
It's decent.

352
00:26:33,877 --> 00:26:36,877
And your infirmary,
is it stocked?

353
00:26:36,879 --> 00:26:39,346
Is yours?

354
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:41,948
We came here hoping
to talk trade.

355
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:45,152
Do you have enough
here for that?

356
00:26:45,154 --> 00:26:46,686
You see what I have here.

357
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,355
You see what I've built.

358
00:26:49,892 --> 00:26:54,828
Jesus said that your food situation
was challenged right now.

359
00:26:56,565 --> 00:27:00,834
You don't keep people fed,
it comes apart.

360
00:27:00,836 --> 00:27:04,170
Let's speak the common
tongue here, huh?

361
00:27:04,172 --> 00:27:06,039
You don't have shit.

362
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:09,308
Now, I'm happy to help.
I'm a nice guy.

363
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:13,279
But we can't just give
things away for free.

364
00:27:13,281 --> 00:27:15,248
How's this?

365
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:19,085
Since you can't offer much, I'll let
your people work here for their share.

366
00:27:19,087 --> 00:27:21,654
You'd be a welcome addition
to the community,

367
00:27:21,656 --> 00:27:24,456
a smart and beautiful woman.

368
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:27,492
Getting back
to that common tongue,

369
00:27:27,494 --> 00:27:29,929
I can tell ya, I can make
it worth your while.

370
00:27:29,931 --> 00:27:32,431
- Let me stop you right there.
- Listen, honey.

371
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:36,234
Stop coming on to me
with calling me honey.

372
00:27:36,236 --> 00:27:38,037
You don't have any ammunition.

373
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:39,404
Who said that?

374
00:27:39,406 --> 00:27:41,373
You're low on medication.

375
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:44,109
You need things.
We need things.

376
00:27:44,111 --> 00:27:46,578
What, are you gonna give us a bottle
of aspirin and a box of bullets?

377
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,547
Our communities
can help each other.

378
00:27:51,017 --> 00:27:53,251
Thank you, Natalie.
Been a good talk.

379
00:27:58,524 --> 00:28:00,391
We can help each other.

380
00:28:00,393 --> 00:28:02,393
We're doing fine.

381
00:28:02,395 --> 00:28:04,195
Are you?

382
00:28:13,715 --> 00:28:16,198
We want to generate trade.
Gregory does.

383
00:28:16,438 --> 00:28:18,506
But ammo isn't something
we urgently need.

384
00:28:18,508 --> 00:28:20,708
- Well, how's that?
- The walls hold.

385
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,442
We just brought in
more medicine.

386
00:28:22,444 --> 00:28:24,511
<i>Gregory wants
the best deal possible.</i>

387
00:28:24,513 --> 00:28:26,846
Yeah, well, we want things, too.

388
00:28:26,848 --> 00:28:28,648
<i>We need food.</i>

389
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,418
We came all this way,
we're gonna get it.

390
00:28:33,188 --> 00:28:35,688
I will talk to him

391
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,557
and we will work this out.

392
00:28:39,828 --> 00:28:41,460
Circumstances change.

393
00:28:41,462 --> 00:28:45,498
<i>We're doing well now,
and you will next.</i>

394
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,801
I will make him understand that.

395
00:28:48,803 --> 00:28:50,970
<i>Can you give me a few days?</i>

396
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:56,842
We can.

397
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:04,016
Yeah.

398
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,224
What's wrong?

399
00:29:13,226 --> 00:29:14,826
They're back.

400
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:30,475
<i>Ethan, what
happened to everybody else?</i>

401
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:33,078
<i>Where's Tim and Marsha?</i>

402
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,412
They're dead.

403
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:40,452
- Negan?
- Yeah.

404
00:29:40,454 --> 00:29:43,221
- We had a deal.
<i>- He said it wasn't enough.</i>

405
00:29:43,223 --> 00:29:45,623
Was the drop light?

406
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:47,058
<i>No.</i>

407
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,060
They still have Craig.

408
00:29:49,062 --> 00:29:53,130
They said they'd keep him
alive, return him to us,

409
00:29:53,132 --> 00:29:55,566
if I deliver a message to you.

410
00:29:55,568 --> 00:29:57,068
So, tell me.

411
00:29:58,404 --> 00:29:59,971
I'm sorry.

412
00:30:03,476 --> 00:30:06,210
Get off of me!
I had to!

413
00:30:26,832 --> 00:30:28,531
<i>Maybe that's why.</i>

414
00:30:28,533 --> 00:30:30,967
<i>Because the way things go.</i>

415
00:30:35,273 --> 00:30:37,206
<i> Hey!</i>

416
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:39,742
Stay back! Anybody
who tries to stop me

417
00:30:39,744 --> 00:30:41,344
is killing my brother!

418
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:47,016
<i>Drop it.</i>

419
00:31:13,243 --> 00:31:15,243
What?

420
00:31:15,245 --> 00:31:18,246
Ethan!
You killed him.

421
00:31:18,248 --> 00:31:20,715
He tried to kill
Gregory, then me.

422
00:31:22,819 --> 00:31:24,318
Ah!

423
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,887
Don't.

424
00:31:25,889 --> 00:31:28,622
Drop it now!

425
00:31:28,624 --> 00:31:29,757
I don't think I will.

426
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:31,859
Everyone, this is over!

427
00:31:34,164 --> 00:31:35,529
It's over.

428
00:31:35,531 --> 00:31:39,266
Ethan was our friend,
but let's not pretend

429
00:31:39,268 --> 00:31:42,102
he was anything more than
a coward who attacked us.

430
00:31:42,104 --> 00:31:44,271
He did this.

431
00:31:45,974 --> 00:31:47,675
And these people stopped him.

432
00:31:55,117 --> 00:31:57,184
What can I do?

433
00:31:57,186 --> 00:32:00,020
Put the gun away.

434
00:32:00,022 --> 00:32:01,487
You've done enough.

435
00:32:05,694 --> 00:32:07,627
You need to know

436
00:32:07,629 --> 00:32:09,863
that things aren't
as simple as they might seem.

437
00:32:12,267 --> 00:32:14,133
Just give me some time.

438
00:32:27,649 --> 00:32:29,716
<i>- Hey, man.</i>
- Huh?

439
00:32:29,718 --> 00:32:31,283
You good?

440
00:32:31,285 --> 00:32:33,652
Yeah.

441
00:32:33,654 --> 00:32:36,055
I'm better than all right.

442
00:32:52,086 --> 00:32:54,687
<i>Dr. Carson was
able to patch Gregory up.</i>

443
00:32:54,689 --> 00:32:57,056
<i>He's in pain, but he'll live.</i>

444
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:00,126
So, what happens now?

445
00:33:00,128 --> 00:33:02,161
Things like that
don't usually happen here,

446
00:33:02,163 --> 00:33:05,598
but, uh, it's settled.

447
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,200
We heard the name Negan.

448
00:33:08,202 --> 00:33:12,604
A while back, Daryl and Abraham
had a run-in with his men.

449
00:33:12,606 --> 00:33:14,240
Who is he?

450
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:18,110
Negan's the head of a group of
people he calls the Saviors.

451
00:33:18,112 --> 00:33:22,481
As soon as the walls were
built, the Saviors showed up.

452
00:33:22,483 --> 00:33:25,216
They met with Gregory
on behalf of their boss.

453
00:33:25,218 --> 00:33:29,621
They made a lot of demands,
even more threats.

454
00:33:29,623 --> 00:33:33,324
And he killed
one of us-- Rory.

455
00:33:33,326 --> 00:33:35,961
<i>He was 16 years old.</i>

456
00:33:35,963 --> 00:33:40,298
They beat him to death
right in front of us.

457
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:44,135
Said we needed to understand,
right off the bat.

458
00:33:45,738 --> 00:33:48,873
<i>Gregory's not exactly
good at confrontation.</i>

459
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:50,442
<i>He's not the leader
I would've chosen,</i>

460
00:33:50,444 --> 00:33:53,211
but he helped make
this place what it is,

461
00:33:53,213 --> 00:33:54,679
and the people like him.

462
00:33:54,681 --> 00:33:56,647
He made the deal.

463
00:33:56,649 --> 00:33:58,583
<i>Half of everything.</i>

464
00:33:58,585 --> 00:34:01,485
Our supplies, our crops,

465
00:34:01,487 --> 00:34:05,389
our livestock,
it goes to the Saviors.

466
00:34:05,391 --> 00:34:07,758
And what do you get in return?

467
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,159
They don't attack this place.

468
00:34:09,161 --> 00:34:11,295
They don't kill us.

469
00:34:11,297 --> 00:34:13,363
Why not just kill them?

470
00:34:13,365 --> 00:34:15,732
Most of the people here don't
even know how to fight,

471
00:34:15,734 --> 00:34:17,033
even if we had ammo.

472
00:34:17,035 --> 00:34:19,470
Well, how many people
does Negan have?

473
00:34:19,472 --> 00:34:20,770
<i>We don't know.</i>

474
00:34:20,772 --> 00:34:22,739
We've seen groups as big as 20.

475
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:25,709
Now, hold up. So, they
show up, they kill a kid,

476
00:34:25,711 --> 00:34:28,312
and you give them
half of everything?

477
00:34:28,314 --> 00:34:30,146
These dicks just got
a good story.

478
00:34:30,148 --> 00:34:31,915
The bogeyman, he ain't shit.

479
00:34:31,917 --> 00:34:33,516
Well, how do you know?

480
00:34:33,518 --> 00:34:36,853
A month ago, we took
his guys out PDQ.

481
00:34:36,855 --> 00:34:39,455
Left them in pieces and puddles.

482
00:34:39,457 --> 00:34:41,825
You know, we'll do it.

483
00:34:41,827 --> 00:34:45,228
If we go get your man back,
kill Negan, take out his boys,

484
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,962
will you hook us up?

485
00:34:46,964 --> 00:34:49,632
We want food, medicine,
and one of them cows.

486
00:34:51,503 --> 00:34:55,871
Confrontation's never been
something we've had trouble with.

487
00:35:00,711 --> 00:35:02,512
I'll take it to Gregory.

488
00:35:13,057 --> 00:35:16,825
They have food, we don't.

489
00:35:16,827 --> 00:35:19,461
We don't have
enough of anything.

490
00:35:19,463 --> 00:35:22,631
Except us.

491
00:35:22,633 --> 00:35:24,999
What we can do.

492
00:35:28,938 --> 00:35:31,839
This is the trade.

493
00:35:33,109 --> 00:35:35,210
It's gonna cost us something.

494
00:35:41,151 --> 00:35:44,251
Gregory's up.
He wants to talk.

495
00:35:46,289 --> 00:35:47,521
To Maggie.

496
00:35:48,624 --> 00:35:51,959
He wants to talk to Maggie.

497
00:35:51,961 --> 00:35:53,694
You got this.

498
00:35:56,131 --> 00:35:58,199
Deanna was right about you.

499
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:04,905
I'm sorry in advance.
Gregory can be a real prick.

500
00:36:04,907 --> 00:36:06,607
I know.

501
00:36:08,611 --> 00:36:11,511
Come in.

502
00:36:11,513 --> 00:36:12,979
Mm.

503
00:36:12,981 --> 00:36:16,416
Sorry for the gloom.

504
00:36:16,418 --> 00:36:19,119
They have me
on these antibiotics

505
00:36:19,121 --> 00:36:22,255
that make me sensitive
to the sunlight.

506
00:36:22,257 --> 00:36:24,591
<i>This is agony.</i>

507
00:36:24,593 --> 00:36:28,027
It's like somebody's twisting my
intestines with a cement mixer.

508
00:36:28,029 --> 00:36:30,062
It could've been worse.

509
00:36:30,064 --> 00:36:32,532
You're lucky we were here.

510
00:36:32,534 --> 00:36:34,567
Jesus told you about our offer?

511
00:36:34,569 --> 00:36:35,935
He did.

512
00:36:35,937 --> 00:36:37,870
What makes you think you can
do what we haven't done?

513
00:36:37,872 --> 00:36:40,607
We've handled people like Negan.

514
00:36:40,609 --> 00:36:43,909
- How?
- They're dead.

515
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:45,577
We can get your man back.

516
00:36:47,982 --> 00:36:50,649
I don't know if Craig's
worth the trouble.

517
00:36:50,651 --> 00:36:53,152
I mean, it's his
brother who did this.

518
00:36:53,154 --> 00:36:57,757
He was fighting to save
someone he loves.

519
00:36:57,759 --> 00:36:58,990
He was afraid.

520
00:36:58,992 --> 00:37:01,793
That makes him weak.

521
00:37:01,795 --> 00:37:04,396
Frankly, I don't know if I want
him back in our gene pool.

522
00:37:04,398 --> 00:37:08,667
My dad used to tell me forgiveness
takes more strength than anger.

523
00:37:08,669 --> 00:37:11,236
Yeah, I guess.

524
00:37:11,238 --> 00:37:12,871
He's a hell of a cook.

525
00:37:12,873 --> 00:37:16,141
He makes these amazing baked
eggs with green tomatoes.

526
00:37:16,143 --> 00:37:19,510
You give us supplies,
we'll save Craig

527
00:37:19,512 --> 00:37:22,380
and take care of Negan
and the Saviors, permanently.

528
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:27,318
<i>I'm sorry, I find this whole
conversation pretty funny.</i>

529
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,921
I mean, you balked
when I proposed

530
00:37:29,923 --> 00:37:33,491
that your people work for
our supplies, but now...

531
00:37:33,493 --> 00:37:35,959
<i>isn't that exactly
what's happening here?</i>

532
00:37:35,961 --> 00:37:39,430
<i>See, I had leverage
and I used it.</i>

533
00:37:39,432 --> 00:37:41,999
See?
It wasn't personal.

534
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:43,834
<i>Yes.</i>

535
00:37:43,836 --> 00:37:47,104
We need food.
You have it.

536
00:37:47,106 --> 00:37:49,106
We're willing to work for it.

537
00:37:51,877 --> 00:37:54,644
Then I'll get supplies
for your people.

538
00:37:54,646 --> 00:37:56,313
Good.

539
00:37:56,315 --> 00:38:00,284
<i>I'll talk to Jesus and he'll
make the arrangements.</i>

540
00:38:00,286 --> 00:38:02,019
See, this was fun.

541
00:38:04,123 --> 00:38:06,088
Exciting.

542
00:38:09,695 --> 00:38:11,761
Half.

543
00:38:11,763 --> 00:38:13,062
Excuse me?

544
00:38:13,064 --> 00:38:15,665
<i>Half of what you have.</i>

545
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:17,867
I saw what happened out there.

546
00:38:17,869 --> 00:38:21,370
Negan's expecting
more supplies from this place.

547
00:38:21,372 --> 00:38:24,340
And more and more.

548
00:38:24,342 --> 00:38:25,808
And if it keeps going like that,

549
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:28,410
pretty soon you won't
have anything left.

550
00:38:29,914 --> 00:38:32,081
<i>What happens then?</i>

551
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:36,385
<i>Without ammo,
without fighters...</i>

552
00:38:36,387 --> 00:38:38,320
you'd be a dead man.

553
00:38:41,492 --> 00:38:44,059
So half of everything you have

554
00:38:44,061 --> 00:38:46,261
right now

555
00:38:46,263 --> 00:38:48,364
or the deal's off.

556
00:38:49,633 --> 00:38:52,234
You see?

557
00:38:52,236 --> 00:38:54,102
I have leverage.

558
00:38:59,142 --> 00:39:01,877
Congratulations.

559
00:39:01,879 --> 00:39:05,146
You have yourself a deal.

560
00:39:05,148 --> 00:39:08,283
You want anything else?
Kidney, maybe?

561
00:39:08,285 --> 00:39:10,718
Not that...

562
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,353
but I do want something.

563
00:39:20,162 --> 00:39:22,930
Even Negan didn't get
this much up front.

564
00:39:26,202 --> 00:39:27,801
What?

565
00:39:27,803 --> 00:39:31,605
Jesus said you've been taking supplies
to Negan since the beginning.

566
00:39:32,975 --> 00:39:35,276
We're gonna get Craig back.

567
00:39:35,278 --> 00:39:38,645
The only way to get Craig back
is to bring them Gregory's head.

568
00:39:39,982 --> 00:39:41,949
We're gonna get Craig back.

569
00:39:41,951 --> 00:39:43,717
How?

570
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:46,420
We need to know what you
know about Negan's compound.

571
00:39:47,823 --> 00:39:49,989
We need your help.

572
00:39:51,126 --> 00:39:52,759
We need you to come.

573
00:40:00,969 --> 00:40:03,169
Yeah.

574
00:40:03,171 --> 00:40:05,004
Okay.

575
00:40:15,516 --> 00:40:18,116
You got room
for one more, right?

576
00:40:18,118 --> 00:40:21,554
I mean, we're talking about
righting the world here.

577
00:40:21,556 --> 00:40:23,355
Plus, you still have my knives.

578
00:40:29,697 --> 00:40:31,864
Hey, you up for this?

579
00:40:32,934 --> 00:40:34,632
It's gonna be a fight.

580
00:40:34,634 --> 00:40:37,235
We'll win.

581
00:40:37,237 --> 00:40:38,736
We have to.

582
00:40:41,241 --> 00:40:42,975
We'll win.

583
00:42:20,013 --> 00:42:30,079
