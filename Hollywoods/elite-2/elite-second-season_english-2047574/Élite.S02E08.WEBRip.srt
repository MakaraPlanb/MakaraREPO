0 HOURS MISSING

2
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,160
SAMUEL
Just send me a message. Whenever.

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,520
SAMUEL
I just want to make sure you're okay.

4
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,120
Are you having fun?

5
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,440
You think it's funny?

6
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,600
If you had a little bit of decency
or you weren't all bored,

7
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,840
you'd all delete the video.

8
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,440
Leave it, Guzmán.

9
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Nadia...

10
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,280
I know you don't need anyone
to defend you but...

11
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,960
I don't deserve anyone to defend me.

12
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,280
I should never have done
something like that.

13
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:18,056
- It's normal for people to think I'm a...
- Listen to me.

14
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,400
You can't let these idiots
make you think that.

15
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,600
You're not like that.

16
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,280
Go now. We have an exam to do.

17
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,200
Everyone sit down. We're about to start.

18
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,240
You have one hour for the exam.

19
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,920
Please, put all your books away.

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,120
Samuel's missing.

21
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,400
And do you know if he is late,
or is he sick?

22
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,440
He is never late, because if the pizza
arrives cold, he doesn't get paid.

23
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,280
And he's not sick either.

24
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,216
If he were,
that geek would have called 100 times

25
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,480
to ask if they could please,
please postpone the exam.

26
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,240
Guzmán, sit down now.

27
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,560
<i>The number you are calling
is switched off...</i>

28
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,920
<i>Why are you so worried?</i>

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,680
Call his mother, okay? And if he's in bed
with the flu, then everybody's happy.

30
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,600
He didn't sleep at home.

31
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,520
Are you sure?

32
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,040
No one has seen him since yesterday?

33
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,320
Okay.

34
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,520
Thank you.

35
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,440
Shit.

36
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,560
10 HOURS MISSING

37
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,640
<i>Police, how may I help you?</i>

38
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,440
Do you know what this could mean
for Nadia,

39
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,240
for her family, for her entire life?
Do you know, idiot?

40
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,280
The problem is
her religion is too repressive about sex.

41
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,240
Things would be different if it weren't.

42
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,040
But you're right. It wasn't
the little raghead's fault, it was yours.

43
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,080
You're the one who recorded the video.

44
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,080
Not so that the whole school could see it.

45
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,280
So what was your intention?

46
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,240
Something so noble and altruistic?
Don't bullshit me.

47
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,416
Your intention was to destroy
my relationship with Guzmán

48
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,000
and make us both miserable.

49
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,640
By the way...

50
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,520
you and I are the same.

51
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,240
Isn't this what you wanted,
for me to stop holding back?

52
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,400
Well, here I am...

53
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,760
uninhibited.

54
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,600
In two days,
nobody will remember the video. Trust me.

55
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,680
Right now, all I know is...

56
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,920
you're the only one
who is not laughing at me.

57
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,560
Nadia, I recorded the video.

58
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,760
Hey, darling.

59
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,840
Tell us where you are going for Christmas.

60
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,400
Bora Bora, Maldives? I guess anywhere
they're looking for cleaning staff, right?

61
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,120
- Lu, that's enough.
- Dear Polo!

62
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,800
If you need a new cleaner, I can recommend
others that are much more trustworthy.

63
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,360
Can you please let me talk
to my girlfriend?

64
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,440
Stop it.

65
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,000
Listen, Polo, I thought
that my life could be a fairy tale,

66
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,200
that I could be Cinderella...

67
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,280
Quite funny. That's what they teach us
when we're little.

68
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,640
But it's all a lie.

69
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,520
It's best that I go back to my world
and you go to yours.

70
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,480
I don't want to taint you.

71
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,640
What do you mean, go back to your world?

72
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,560
I've been kicked out.

73
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,440
And my mom has been fired.

74
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,840
And since there are no more exams,
today is my last day.

75
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,640
Doesn't Cinderella have a happy ending?

76
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,720
Yes.

77
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,800
Because it's a fairy tale for children.

78
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,600
Please, tell me you're going to find him.
This can't be happening.

79
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,640
We will do everything we can.

80
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,360
<i>What we know so far is that Samuel's bike
was found yesterday in the forest.</i>

81
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,840
<i>But there was no trace of him.</i>

82
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,360
36 HOURS MISSING

83
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,720
We are going to be carrying out a search
this afternoon

84
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,200
to try and find him,
or any clue as to his whereabouts.

85
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,560
It would be good if any of you
could come along to help.

86
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,080
But do they think he's dead?

87
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,480
Are we looking for a dead body?

88
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,200
Our hope is to find him alive.

89
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,960
- Tell me it wasn't you.
- Ander...

90
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,200
What happened with Marina was an accident.

91
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,120
Do you really think I am capable
of killing someone in cold blood?

92
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,600
You threatened him in front of me.

93
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,640
I was at home when he disappeared.
With Valerio. In his bed.

94
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,200
You wouldn't get your hands dirty.

95
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,080
You wouldn't even need to leave your house
to hurt somebody.

96
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,616
You'd just make a phone call
and get others to take care of it.

97
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,520
Your father could have made a call,

98
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,216
and we already know
what happened to Christian.

99
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,976
My father was fine until you came along
and started talking about Samuel.

100
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,456
What are you saying? That it's my fault?

101
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,360
- You got him into this mess.
- Relax, dude.

102
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,200
We don't know what happened to him.

103
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,520
He's dead.

104
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,680
You don't know that.

105
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,800
They found his bike
smashed up in the forest.

106
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,000
This was not a normal accident.
Someone wanted to get rid of him.

107
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,760
Someone like you, for example.

108
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,640
Nobody wanted him dead more than you did.

109
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,360
If I had done it,

110
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,176
I'd give myself up to the police today
with my head held high, don't you think?

111
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,440
What are you going to do?

112
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,480
Go to the police?

113
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,680
Accuse your own father?

114
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,880
Tell the truth!

115
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,120
And those people will know you snitched.

116
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,536
If you think they killed Samuel,
what do you think will do to you?

117
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,680
You could also have an accident.

118
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,520
Carla's father is capable of anything.

119
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,680
I'm telling you to protect yourself.

120
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,320
I'm saying this for your own good.

121
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,480
Don't do anything.

122
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,000
So then what?

123
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,936
Do we just sit back and fucking enjoy
Christmas, as though nothing happened?

124
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,080
We learn to live
with what we've done, all right?

125
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,440
Forever.

126
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,520
Shit!

127
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,560
Do you think one of your classmates
could have something to do

128
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,240
with Samuel's disappearance?

129
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,880
I don't know anything.

130
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,040
I'm sorry.

131
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,480
Okay, thank you.

132
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,480
Next, Cayetana Grajera Pando.

133
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,360
What's going on?

134
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,680
Nothing.

135
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,360
I know you, Carla.

136
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,560
Or are you going to keep this
to yourself, too?

137
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,200
Samuel is not missing.

138
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,440
He's dead.

139
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,040
- Samuel!
- Samu!

140
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,120
Samuel!

141
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,120
Nadia.

142
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,280
- What are you doing here?
- Why do you seem surprised?

143
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,560
I wanted him out of my sight,
but not like this.

144
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,600
Inspector!

145
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,000
I found something.

146
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,576
You don't just have an accident, run off
and leave your jacket lying around.

147
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,000
No way.
Those thugs have done something to him.

148
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,720
I should go to the police, right?

149
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,400
Shit... I'm a fucking coward.

150
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,440
How can I know something like this
and keep quiet?

151
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,240
We were thinking about having
some Christmas drinks tomorrow

152
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,120
at the VIP area of Barceló.

153
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,200
Maybe you could talk to your boss
and open a bit earlier for us.

154
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,280
I'm sorry?

155
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,520
So we can get in easily
before the crowds arrive.

156
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,256
I'm telling you that I think
my best friend has been murdered

157
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,520
and you're telling me about the glass of
champagne you're going to drink tomorrow?

158
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,440
- I was trying to change the subject.
- Why?

159
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,840
I don't know, Omar.

160
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,600
It doesn't matter.

161
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,920
It matters to me.

162
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,376
I'm tired of you acting so strange
all the time.

163
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,960
Of having to decipher your every
gesture, every word, every look,

164
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,600
just to try and understand you.

165
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,520
I guess it was those thugs. They wanted
to retaliate and they got to him.

166
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,320
You think it's normal that Samuel could be
dead because of you, because of us?

167
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,880
Baby...

168
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,840
I was very fond of Samuel, too.

169
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,800
It may not be normal,
but it wouldn't surprise me.

170
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,016
What do you think
they're talking about on the news

171
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,816
when they say that there's been
a settling of scores?

172
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,720
They're talking about this, girl, this.

173
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,840
The shoes, the jewelry, this house...

174
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,920
They all come at a price, and it's more
than what it says on the tag.

175
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,280
Yeah, and the queen never pays the price.
It's always the pawn.

176
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,400
What do you mean by that?

177
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,360
What do you mean?

178
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,600
That when dad got killed,
that's exactly what they said to you.

179
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,440
That it was an occupational hazard, too.

180
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,000
Did you forget about that?

181
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,736
That fat cat from the construction company
didn't give a shit

182
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,280
about the blue-collar guys
as long as he lived like a god.

183
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,000
I don't care how we achieved all this.

184
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,360
What fucks me up is
that we've become one of them.

185
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,040
Cayetana.

186
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,240
So...

187
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,040
I'm going to start
with the clothes in the wardrobe.

188
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,160
Don't go.

189
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,640
I wanted to talk to you, too.

190
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,840
What's going on?

191
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,840
I guess the principal
will call you tomorrow, but...

192
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,120
I wanted to give you the news in person.

193
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,120
The two of you can come back to school.

194
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,800
How is this possible?

195
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,360
My mothers are on the Parents Association.

196
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,640
At our school,
parents are not just parents,

197
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,160
they are customers as well.

198
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,480
And the customer is always right.

199
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,120
I'm very grateful to you, Polo, but...

200
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,640
It can't be.

201
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,880
With what they pay me there,
it's not even enough to pay our debts.

202
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,000
I know.

203
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,640
With that, I think you'll be able
to manage for a few months,

204
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,120
at least until the end of the year.

205
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,520
Because graduating from Las Encinas
opens many doors.

206
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,840
We cannot accept this.

207
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,200
- Yes, you can.
- No...

208
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,200
My mothers have the money to spare
and they love charity.

209
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,200
They feel like better people for it.
And so do I.

210
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,560
There aren't many things
that make me feel that way of late.

211
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,000
But how did you convince them?

212
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,000
I told them that even though
we make huge mistakes,

213
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,920
we all deserve a second chance, right?

214
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,280
He's the brother of that kid, Samuel.

215
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,760
He looks innocent, but he is not really.

216
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,920
He's involved in dodgy dealings

217
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,240
with the family that bought
Guzmán's house, Dad.

218
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,816
- Sheila, stop it.
- Remember? It's unbelievable.

219
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,560
And she goes to your school as well?

220
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,120
Unfortunately. She's total trash.

221
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,760
I call her drug-dealer Barbie.

222
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,080
She looks like she's going
to take her gun out any time.

223
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,280
She quickly became friends
with Miss Palestine, by the way.

224
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,120
The fundamentalist. She is no saint.

225
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,096
It turns out she gets down
on her knees for more than just prayer.

226
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,200
- Lu, please...
- That's what the video shows.

227
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,600
I can send it to you
if you'd like to watch it.

228
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,920
And then they say
we Mexicans love soap operas.

229
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,920
We have a lot of 'em here.

230
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,080
I don't know whether we ought
to take you out of that school.

231
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,440
No, I really have fun there.

232
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,480
Well, let's not get carried away, Dad.

233
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:42,080
It's not as if Lu is an angel fallen from
heaven and all the others are depraved.

234
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,440
Of course. You're in your element
with all that riffraff.

235
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,840
But I want what's best for my daughter.

236
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,240
I've changed, Dad.

237
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,520
Your clothes, maybe.

238
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,720
I love this.

239
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,320
I have turned my life around.

240
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,400
For real this time.

241
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,360
I'm taking private lessons.

242
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,200
I study hard...

243
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:13,200
I know my future is very promising
and I don't want to miss that chance.

244
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,760
I practically live the life
of an altar boy now.

245
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,160
- I think Valerio is doing his best.
- Thank you.

246
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,720
Seriously. That's what he has to do.

247
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,040
The good influence of his sister
helps a lot.

248
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,000
I know I could leave them on their own
because they'd take care of each other.

249
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,120
VALERIO
Look under the table, Dad.

250
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,920
That's really important.

251
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,160
I think it hasn't been good for our son
to be an only child.

252
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,920
Not having someone to play with,
to help him.

253
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,120
Someone who can...

254
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,920
Someone to help him, to give him
some affection when we are not there.

255
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,040
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

256
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,480
What...

257
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,880
- I pay for all this. Don't you dare...
- I don't care who pays for this all.

258
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:15,119
Those kids are on their own all day long.
They just want our attention.

259
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,200
- Please, don't give me that psychobabble.
- Psychobabble?

260
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,880
You're always attacking them.

261
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,200
I thought you loved me.

262
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,920
I thought so, too.

263
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,400
Sometimes you convince yourself
that you love someone,

264
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,080
you idolize them,

265
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,800
but suddenly they do something

266
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,920
and in an instant...

267
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,360
that image you have of them crumbles,

268
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,480
and the love disappears.

269
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,240
You see them for what they really are.

270
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,160
And what am I?

271
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
My sister.

272
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,400
That's all.

273
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,200
I don't understand where Samuel
was going at that time and on that road.

274
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,200
He can't have been going home.

275
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,840
Poor Pilar.
It must be really hard for her.

276
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,200
I know...

277
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,480
She was out all day working,

278
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,320
and of course, she had no idea
where her son was, or with whom.

279
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,480
Samuel is a good boy.

280
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,720
You are a good girl.

281
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,760
As for Samuel...

282
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,600
I don't want to talk bad
about someone who...

283
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,360
Who knows what has happened to him.
Nothing, I hope.

284
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,400
- Dad?
- Yes?

285
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,360
I...

286
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,960
I...

287
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,320
I have also done things that...

288
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,880
that I shouldn't have.

289
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,440
What happened, Nadia?

290
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
There is...

291
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,680
There is a...

292
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,120
a video...

293
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,720
of me with...

294
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,360
What?

295
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,880
Everyone... Everyone has seen it.

296
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,600
It is a disgrace for you,

297
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,400
for the family...

298
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,600
I thought that trying
those things wasn't bad.

299
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,520
I should have listened to you.

300
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,880
I have failed you.

301
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,040
No...

302
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,600
My place is here, with you.

303
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,040
Nadia, is it really so terrible?

304
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,280
It doesn't matter. We will never see it.

305
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,640
If it arrives, delete it.

306
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,040
The girl it shows is not our daughter.

307
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,400
- Did you do it?
- Hold on.

308
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,800
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

309
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,400
I'm not playing the fool anymore.

310
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,400
What have you done to Samuel?

311
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,320
I'll call you back.

312
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,800
Carla, don't go there.

313
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,920
Tell me he is all right.

314
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,160
Darling, I know you are...

315
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,880
I know you're very much upset
about all this.

316
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,200
Nothing is going on.
Samuel will turn up, I'm sure of it.

317
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,840
Just like you had nothing to do
with Christian, right?

318
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,200
I promise
I have nothing to do with all this.

319
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,880
How about we order some pancakes?

320
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,760
I don't want any fucking pancakes.

321
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,760
Sorry.

322
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,760
I'm sorry.

323
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,120
I shouldn't have spoken to you like that.

324
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,200
66 HOURS MISSING

325
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,600
Ander.

326
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,000
Did you get this photo?

327
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,800
It's from yesterday, the search.
Do you know what it is?

328
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,280
It's Samuel's jacket.

329
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,160
It's stained with blood, man.

330
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,160
How did you know he was dead?

331
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,960
I just said it.

332
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,720
Are you all right, Carla?

333
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,920
Sure.

334
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,720
Well, I feel sorry for his family.

335
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,840
First his brother, now this...

336
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,520
Guzmán.

337
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,120
Can you come with me?

338
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,496
I would like to ask you a few questions.

339
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,560
Again?

340
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,920
Your grandparents have a country house.
That's where Marina's ashes are buried.

341
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,320
What was Samuel doing around there?

342
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,480
If you have something to accuse me of,
get on with it.

343
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,480
Otherwise, leave me in peace.

344
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,440
I'm supposed to be studying
with my friends.

345
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,160
Do they miss me?

346
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:17,080
GUZMÁN
I believe you.

347
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,760
SAMUEL
Should we meet later in a quiet place?

348
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,320
What the fuck are you doing?
Don't you know how to ring the doorbell?

349
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,800
What's the matter?

350
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,240
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Fuck.

351
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,240
He's not here. Let's go.

352
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,520
Could you please tell me
who the fuck those people were?

353
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,480
- I'm mixed up in different shit.
- You're mixed up in all the shit.

354
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,520
Some thugs want to retaliate
against Rebeca's mom.

355
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,800
Fucking hell, Samuel.

356
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,200
It's a long story, but by coming here,
we made it easy for them.

357
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,200
There is no one on this road.

358
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,440
Well, you were the one
who wanted a quiet place to talk.

359
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,280
Well, here we are, at my grandparents'.

360
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,200
Maybe I should disappear for a while.

361
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,560
I don't think they will forget.
They tried to run you over.

362
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,720
- Clean yourself up.
- Okay.

363
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,040
All you will do is make them more nervous.

364
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,560
I guess...

365
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,960
Are you okay?

366
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,320
CARLA
I just want to make sure you're okay.

367
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,080
What would Carla do
if something really happened to me?

368
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,120
I don't get you.

369
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,920
This is crazy, but it may work.

370
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
What?

371
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,600
She needs to suffer.

372
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,280
Do they think he's dead?

373
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,760
Are we looking for a dead body?

374
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,360
She needs to think that something
really awful has happened to me.

375
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,280
- Fuck!
- Shit! How can you bleed so much?

376
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,736
- Fucking hell!
- How fucking gross!

377
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,160
That's when she'll break.

378
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,680
Samu!

379
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,840
Samu!

380
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,320
Samu!

381
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,480
But she is a cold girl. And she's strong.

382
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,440
Do you know what it is?

383
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,960
It's Samuel's jacket.

384
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,680
Guzmán.

385
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,040
I would like to ask you a few questions.

386
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,160
<i>The police are all over this.</i>

387
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,760
Carla is standing firm.

388
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,160
<i>...a desperate call
in front of our cameras.</i>

389
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:16,000
<i>If anyone has seen him,
or knows something...</i>

390
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,960
<i>I have already lost one son.</i>

391
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,600
You know this is a crime, right?
We could go to prison.

392
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,080
Okay, let's leave it, then.

393
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,920
How are you going
to get Carla and Polo to confess?

394
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,440
We have no evidence.
We have nothing, for fuck's sake.

395
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,200
And Carla's father knows
about my suspicions.

396
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,120
I could have an accident any day,
just like Christian did.

397
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,360
Either he ends up in prison,
or I end up in the hospital.

398
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,720
That's if I don't end up six feet under.

399
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,600
Listen.

400
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:48,000
If my mother, Omar, or whoever suffers,
it's a real bitch.

401
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,280
It fucks me up more than anyone.

402
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,400
But we're not fucking this up now.

403
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,520
<i>This is the tip hotline
for the public to cooperate</i>

404
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,520
<i>regarding the disappearance
of Samuel García.</i>

405
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,120
<i>Do you have any information?</i>

406
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,480
<i>Hello?</i>

407
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,240
Lu has a headache?

408
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,800
It's an excuse.
She doesn't want to see me.

409
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,000
Me neither.

410
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,400
I'm going to go get another drink.
Do you want any?

411
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,480
No?

412
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,520
Hey.

413
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,440
What are you doing for Christmas?
I'm escaping to Andorra for a few days.

414
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,880
I'm not sure yet.

415
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,560
Why don't you come with us?

416
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,880
Like in the good old days,
we'll go skiing, eat, drink...

417
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,280
We can also skip the skiing part.

418
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,760
I'm a bit broke right now.

419
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,240
It's on me, for fuck's sake.
What are friends for?

420
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,320
What do you think?

421
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,400
- Guzmán!
- Fuck.

422
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,400
What a shit glass.
I'm going to clean up. Be right back.

423
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,280
Cheer up, it's Christmas.

424
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,680
Samuel's poster is on the door,
but everyone is dancing.

425
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,120
What the fuck are we doing?

426
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,520
Getting drunk.

427
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,040
Some more than others.

428
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,880
Shit.

429
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,640
Everyone is handling it in their own way.

430
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,080
You have to hang in there.

431
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,920
What's the point
of hanging in there, Polo?

432
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,120
We have done everything, everything,
so that we don't get caught.

433
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,240
For what?

434
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,200
Have you done anything worthwhile
these last few months?

435
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,880
Is this living?

436
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,440
Omar!

437
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,920
- Baby, get me something to drink.
- I can't right now.

438
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,336
Come on, get me something to drink.

439
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,920
I told you to wait. What are you doing?

440
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,960
What the hell, man?

441
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,440
Come on, it's Christmas!

442
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,960
Ander! Ander!

443
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,520
Call an ambulance! Ander!

444
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,480
Do you remember anything?

445
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,640
Your mom's really worried.

446
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,720
She keeps asking me what's wrong with you.

447
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,120
As if I knew...

448
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,120
Anyway...

449
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,680
You have to take this pill.

450
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,800
I left some water over there for you.

451
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,280
By the way...

452
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,800
I'm leaving.

453
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,280
With my first paycheck, I'm out of here.

454
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,400
Omar...

455
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,840
Don't leave like this, please.

456
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,760
Do you want to talk now?

457
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,760
I see.

458
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,200
That's what I thought.

459
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,520
85 HOURS MISSING

460
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,840
If you had caught the killer,
none of this would have happened.

461
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,240
You have fucked up all of our lives.

462
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,920
<i>Every one of us!</i>

463
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,120
My family, some rest...

464
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,576
- Sounds good.
- I like it because...

465
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,720
I can't take it anymore.

466
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,080
I'm sorry.

467
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,720
Inspector.

468
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,400
We have the warrant.

469
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,480
Carla!

470
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,640
What are you going to do?

471
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,720
- Let go of me.
- What are you going to do?

472
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,920
It's over.

473
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,080
No... Think about it.
You can't do this. Carla!

474
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,600
Where's the inspector?

475
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,040
Azucena.

476
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,320
Where's the inspector?
I need to talk to her.

477
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,160
- Omar, they have arrested someone.
- Who?

478
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,880
You won't mind accompanying us

479
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,760
while we search
your grandparents' country house, right?

480
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,840
That way, if, by any chance, we find
something, we will have you close by.

481
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,719
Not at all, Inspector.

482
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,760
The only thing is
I need to call my parents first.

483
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:23,040
Don't worry, we already have.

484
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,320
Let's go.

485
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,360
TEENAGE BOY GONE MISSING NEAR FOREST

486
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,600
We come here in summer.

487
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,000
You might find some cobwebs, at best.

488
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,480
Down there.

489
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,640
No one there either?

490
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,120
No one. Cobwebs and the boiler.

491
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,160
There's nothing here. Let's go.

492
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,440
A student wants to talk to you.
She is waiting for you at the school.

493
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,800
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

494
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,240
Let's go back to Las Encinas.

495
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,960
Wait here.

496
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,120
They told me you wanted to talk to me.

497
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,600
Yes, please.

498
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,640
Come with me.

499
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,480
I can't believe I'm here again.

500
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,080
What is it?

501
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,720
What's going on?

502
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,880
Polo?

503
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,240
It's over.

504
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,760
My life is over.

505
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,200
Polo killed Marina.

506
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,960
It was an accident.

507
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,640
I knew.

508
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,480
Christian knew.

509
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,200
And Samuel found out.

510
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,640
That's why he disappeared.

511
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,520
Do they have any evidence?

512
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,960
I know where he threw the trophy.

513
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,240
It's close to the shore.

514
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,480
It won't take them long to find it.

515
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,120
I'm sorry.

516
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,720
- Guzmán...
- You knew.

517
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,640
Next time you faint,
I hope you smash your head open

518
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,840
and bleed to death.

519
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,160
I fell off the bike and some kids
that were passing by

520
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,280
offered for me to go to their house
where they were having a rave.

521
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,696
Everything got a bit out of hand there.

522
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,776
I lost my phone and I didn't hear anything
until yesterday.

523
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,320
Sure. Do you have the names or numbers
of some of those people you were with?

524
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,616
Someone who can corroborate your story?

525
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,600
- I just...
- No, there is no need.

526
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,120
Everything is all right.
This family has already suffered enough.

527
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,640
Thank you, everyone. We're done for today.

528
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,280
Let me take you to the exit.

529
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,560
Thank you for listening to me.

530
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,680
If I had listened to you earlier,
it wouldn't have come to this.

531
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,080
But please, don't do anything like that
again in your life.

532
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,800
As soon as we have a confession
or the murder weapon,

533
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,360
tell your brother to come home.

534
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,120
Will do.

535
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,240
I'll have to come back for the rest.

536
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,520
I knew, Omar.

537
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,000
I knew everything.

538
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,280
Since when?

539
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,040
What does it matter?

540
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,680
Even going one day without confessing
would be enough

541
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,480
to make me a coward, a lowlife.

542
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,320
I'm worse than Polo.

543
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,840
He killed in a fit of rage.

544
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,560
I lied to everyone.

545
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,240
I deceived the people I care about most.

546
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,760
I don't deserve Guzmán.

547
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,560
I don't deserve you.

548
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,520
I deserve to have no one.

549
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,520
Please, go.

550
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,480
Ander, what are you doing?

551
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,720
- Ander... Ander...
- Leave!

552
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,600
- Just leave! For fuck's sake!
- Ander, calm down!

553
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,320
It's okay.

554
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,640
Mystery solved.

555
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,040
You were put in an impossible situation
and didn't know how to react.

556
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,480
You fucked up.

557
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,320
You're a human being.
We fuck up all the time.

558
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,840
If you think you'll get rid of me
just because of this, you're very wrong.

559
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,880
Congratulations.

560
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,280
Do you think that I'm happy?

561
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,880
Why wouldn't you be?

562
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,840
You played me and you won.

563
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,080
I lost you.

564
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,080
You never had me.

565
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,440
2 WEEKS LATER

566
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,360
Samuel.

567
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,320
Everything all right?

568
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,440
Yes, how are you?

569
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,440
Good.

570
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,760
Happy new year.

571
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,040
You are putting off the inevitable.
If you confess, we will be done sooner.

572
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,880
We have Carla's confession.

573
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,880
An angry ex-girlfriend
whose father denies her story, right?

574
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,600
Have you found the trophy?

575
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,400
What if they don't find the trophy?

576
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,640
It's a matter of time.

577
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,360
Sure.

578
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,160
Everyone deserves a second chance.

579
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,320
Why don't you leave me in peace

580
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,280
and look for the real killer,
who is on the run?

581
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,000
Why don't you?

582
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,560
<i>Which, by the way,
is basically admitting that he is guilty.</i>

583
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,640
<i>Let me tell you something.</i>

584
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,040
<i>I think you are the one
that is putting off the inevitable.</i>

585
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,840
Let me go,
and let's put an end to this farce.
