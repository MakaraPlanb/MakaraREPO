1
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,736
<i>If you carry on with your investigation,</i>

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,600
<i>the only thing you will really achieve
will be ending up like Christian.</i>

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,520
Samuel, this is not enough
to change the course of an investigation.

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,440
Less than this was enough
to put my brother in jail.

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,400
- Your brother fit the profile.
- The profile?

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,560
Of someone who could commit
a crime like that.

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,360
- With a criminal record. Violent...
- He's not a murderer.

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,600
- And now he is on the run.
- He has disappeared.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,360
We believe that he is on the run,

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,760
and there is currently
a warrant for his arrest.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,240
Do you see the difference?

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,200
Samuel, go home.

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,240
Focus on your studies.

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,800
Don't get into trouble.

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,560
Stop looking at the past
and focus on your future.

16
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,920
84 HOURS MISSING

17
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,880
You tell me.

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,640
Yesterday, someone called the tip hotline

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,320
for information on Samuel,

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,360
and after 30 seconds of silence,
they hung up.

21
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,400
And?

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,600
We traced the call. It was someone
who knew Samuel very well.

23
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,680
Who?

24
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,640
We just need some more ice.
Do you need anything else?

25
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,320
No.

26
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,840
Listen, are you friends with the guy
who rides the bike? Samu.

27
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,280
The one who lives
on the square with the steps.

28
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,720
Why?

29
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,720
Because you should warn him as a friend
that he'd better watch out.

30
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,560
He got involved with the wrong people.

31
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,840
Bullshit. Just get on with your work.
We still have lots to do.

32
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,720
Remember that I warned you.
Don't come crying to me later.

33
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,760
The police have no time
to listen to your stories.

34
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,496
- They are not stories.
- But they don't believe you.

35
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,040
- Neither do I.
- No.

36
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,280
You don't want to believe me

37
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,680
because you're afraid
that your friends are your enemies,

38
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,960
and I'm the only person telling you
the fucking truth.

39
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,480
Listen, stop...

40
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,320
Stop stirring shit up.

41
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,360
Hi, gorgeous!

42
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,880
- Hi! Sorry.
- It's okay. Do you have a moment?

43
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,120
- Sure.
- I wanted to talk about... something.

44
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,080
There is an NGO, Smile 4 the Child,
that has just arrived here in Spain.

45
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,800
They have made me the Spanish ambassador.

46
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,840
- For real?
- Yes.

47
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,160
- That's great.
- No, really,

48
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,000
they do a fantastic job helping
poor children in developing countries.

49
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,600
- Amazing work.
- Cool.

50
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,760
I'd like to put on a small event.

51
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,640
A charity dinner to start off,
with maybe 10 or 15 people.

52
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,560
- Okay.
- But I haven't got many contacts here yet.

53
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,320
And you need my help, right?

54
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,280
- Yes.
- And you know you'll have it.

55
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,640
Thank you, babe. You're the best.

56
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,840
I know! So are you.

57
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,520
- I'll make a few calls and let you know.
- Okay, darling.

58
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,256
- Thank you, baby.
- Relax. It'll be great.

59
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,280
- Bye.
- Bye.

60
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,040
Well, you tell Marcos for me
that you and he should stop freaking out.

61
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,040
No one is coming to get me,
because I'm a nobody.

62
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,120
Haven't you seen in the movies

63
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,440
how, when they want to scare someone,
they kill the dog?

64
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,640
You're basically the dog.

65
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,816
I saw them around back when I was dealing.

66
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,400
They don't want anyone stepping on
and fucking up their business.

67
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,840
Because that's it, isn't it?
You're dealing.

68
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,920
I only deliver stuff.

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,080
After the grief I got from you to quit
that shit, now you're at it yourself!

70
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,536
Omar, they won't give us back
the bail money.

71
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,800
We need to pay the lawyer.
What I earn is not enough.

72
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,840
- I need the money.
- I needed it, too!

73
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,856
But a friend had a go at me and said
I would end up in prison or worse.

74
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,776
Maybe your friend didn't know
what he was talking about.

75
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,640
Maybe he saved my life.

76
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,920
Samu, one day, Fer, my weed dealer,
stopped picking up the phone.

77
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,776
A week later, he calls me and tells me
he had been in the hospital.

78
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,080
He got shot in the leg.

79
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,720
It seems like easy money,
but it makes your life more difficult.

80
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,120
Why did you call and not say anything?

81
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,120
Who are you afraid of?

82
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,640
- What's going on with Samuel?
- Which Samuel?

83
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,520
- The one from your class.
- Nothing. Nothing is going on. Why?

84
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,040
He went to the police.

85
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,560
He has been talking about you, me, Polo.

86
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,000
Apparently, he even had
a recording of you.

87
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,640
And what was I saying in that recording?

88
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,560
Nothing important, I suppose.

89
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,960
They ignored him. But watch out for him.

90
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,560
Could you do me a favor and meet
your brother so you can give it to him?

91
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,880
Don't tell him I sent it.

92
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,920
He has clothes and doesn't need it.

93
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,160
Omar is not at home.

94
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,640
And it is always colder outside the house.

95
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,240
And...

96
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,000
tell him that his mother
misses him a lot, too.

97
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,640
Well, the fishing was excellent.

98
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,720
I have about 80 people interested
in collaborating. They already confirmed.

99
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,880
Most of them are
the parents from this class.

100
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,960
Well, those that actually have something
to contribute, of course.

101
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,800
Wow, Lu, that's a ton of people.

102
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,840
There's not enough space
in the place I rented.

103
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,440
We'll find somewhere else.

104
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,200
But there won't be time tomorrow.

105
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,400
Darling, do you know
who you're talking to?

106
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,640
I love saying that. It sounds so dramatic.

107
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,960
I got you into this mess,
and I'll get you out of it. Okay?

108
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,120
My dad knows
the owner of the Starlight Hotel.

109
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,840
The terrace is beautiful.

110
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,120
You can count on me.

111
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,320
I forgot how good it feels
when I help the needy.

112
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,840
And I love parties. So do you.

113
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,960
I don't want to give you so much work.

114
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,320
Let's talk to your mother
and get her to give us a hand.

115
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,720
No! She doesn't know anything.

116
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,176
I didn't want her to interrupt
her travels for me.

117
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,560
This is just a silly thing.

118
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,640
You're so sweet.

119
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,840
It's a bit much.

120
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,960
It's a bit too much.

121
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,920
Come on!
Too much to help those in need?

122
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,560
The more people that come, the better.

123
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,960
And it's going to be
such a great party. Relax.

124
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,480
Hey, guys, how about we study together
this afternoon?

125
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,576
Come on, Polo, you will pass
by the skin of your teeth anyway,

126
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,280
but at least this way,
we can have a laugh.

127
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,800
- Count me in.
- Ander.

128
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,800
Ander can't.

129
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,256
Ander is meeting up with Omar,
Ander has to move house.

130
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,600
What now? Are you starting
a ballroom dancing course?

131
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,480
I'm meeting my dad.

132
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,800
Well, shit! That's a new one!

133
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,840
But it's not one of the best.

134
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,720
Let's see if you can work on it a bit.

135
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
See you.

136
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,680
What the fuck is up with him?

137
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,320
- The whole divorce thing.
- No, it's not that.

138
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,560
Lu, can I bother you for a second?

139
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,760
Guzmán, you never bother me.
You're not that important.

140
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,720
Just one question. Why did you invite
my parents to that charity dinner?

141
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,280
I still really like them.

142
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,216
- You should have asked me first.
- I don't have to ask you for permission.

143
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,840
Under normal circumstances, no.
But now that...

144
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,600
Now that we're not... Listen, I haven't
told them that we're not together.

145
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,400
- You haven't?
- No.

146
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,560
Okay. Why?

147
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,120
Because they like you, too. They'd be
worried about me. I'd have to explain.

148
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,880
- Now I have no time to talk to anyone.
- Sure.

149
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,520
Is it too late for you to invent an excuse
so that they won't go?

150
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,240
No.

151
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,440
Let's do something.

152
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,840
You're coming with me
to the charity dinner.

153
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,760
We'll pretend all night long.
And I won't tell the truth.

154
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,360
- What?
- You heard me.

155
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,680
Since we're going to be together
all night, you'd better dress up.

156
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,840
Suit up, please. No checkered tank tops.

157
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,560
Okay?

158
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,160
Okay.

159
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,560
Thanks. Really.

160
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,880
My pleasure.

161
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,520
I told you to put on
a small dinner with strangers

162
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,200
to earn a little bit of money
to pay your bills.

163
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,160
But Lu invited everyone.

164
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,880
- Even my mothers!
- I know.

165
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,560
- Well, if it's about the money...
- It's not about the money!

166
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,296
- Why would it be about the money?
- You heard it.

167
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,480
Money, they can spare.

168
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,896
But my mother is a magazine editor
and has told journalists about it.

169
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,640
They're going to cover the event
and take photos.

170
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,480
What if they find out about you?

171
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,760
I'll take the risk.

172
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,800
Because I don't have any other option.

173
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,160
If my mother doesn't get hired
by any houses around here,

174
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,400
we'll have to leave in a month, maybe two.

175
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,720
I'll have to leave school.
I'll lose everything.

176
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,736
We're not just talking
about paying some bills here.

177
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,840
- I know.
- This is a lot of money.

178
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,240
- It's illegal.
- That's true.

179
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,280
But it could also be my future.

180
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,480
With that kind of money,

181
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,160
I could pay for a caregiver
for my grandfather,

182
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,520
I could go to a good university,
do a master's.

183
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,560
It would be just this once,
never again. I swear.

184
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,080
But it would change my life forever.

185
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,560
What can I do?

186
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,080
Hold my hand and tell me
that everything will be all right.

187
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,560
What's wrong?

188
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,840
It's not from Mom.

189
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,240
Dad is the one
that always says I'll get cold,

190
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,720
to put his coat on
because mine is useless.

191
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,040
You're right.

192
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,520
Dad asked me to lie and I did it,

193
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,080
because I'm the idiot
that does everything they say.

194
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,360
You know what?

195
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,480
Not anymore.

196
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,760
- They want you to come back, Omar.
- And does that piss you off?

197
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,376
It doesn't matter what you do
to disappoint your parents

198
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,760
or how you make them suffer.

199
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,920
In the end, they forgive you.

200
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,600
So, screw the ones
who obey and make sacrifices.

201
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,000
Nadia, I'm not coming back.

202
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,640
And as for you,
all right, you work in the store,

203
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,120
but you're still going to school,

204
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,080
and it's not like
you had much of a social life.

205
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,280
What's the big sacrifice?

206
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,760
Maybe Omar is a bit of a drama queen.

207
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,360
He's worried about me.

208
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,760
Does he have a reason to be?

209
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,000
I don't know, Samu.

210
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,200
My mom is acting really weird lately.

211
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,016
If I don't answer my phone once,
I practically get court-martialed.

212
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,560
The chauffeur is my new shadow.
He carries a gun and everything.

213
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,520
It's like she's scared
someone might do something to me.

214
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,920
Should I tell her you can't do
the delivery tomorrow?

215
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,040
No.

216
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,040
But tell her it's the last one.

217
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,200
- Wake up.
- What?

218
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,280
Wake up.

219
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,880
Now...

220
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,640
What's up?

221
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,880
Hey! Where's your dad?

222
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,440
I told him I already had plans
with friends to study.

223
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,136
No fucking around.
We'll actually be studying.

224
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,320
Order some beer.

225
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,480
- Are you sure?
- Sure.

226
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,600
Pablo! Three beers, please.

227
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,640
The last time Samuel was seen
was at that charity event at the hotel.

228
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,960
Did you talk to him that night?

229
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,000
This is all your fault.

230
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,000
And your shitty investigation.

231
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,480
You know that, don't you?

232
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,360
We're just kids.

233
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,040
We play at being adults, but half the time
we don't know what we're doing.

234
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,240
We fall down because we know
that an adult will always pick us back up.

235
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,640
You were the adult in all of this.

236
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,480
And you failed us.

237
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,440
If you had caught the killer,
none of this would have happened.

238
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,080
You have fucked up all of our lives.

239
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,720
Every one of us!

240
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,560
Everyone is homophobic.
We're brought up that way.

241
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,800
But Guzmán is a bit more.

242
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,920
What? Listen to me.

243
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,696
All I said was you could have
at least warned me

244
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,720
so I could change the sheets,
motherfuckers.

245
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,960
- Who said we came in the bed?
- There you go. We're not that filthy.

246
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,520
Actually, we are.

247
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,440
We came in the cup you keep on the bedside
table for drinking out of at night.

248
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,400
How funny you are! No worries, we're even.

249
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,336
You wouldn't believe
what I've done in your house.

250
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,080
- Really?
- Such as?

251
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,720
Nothing.

252
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,680
But from now on, you'd better watch out.

253
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,760
Okay.

254
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,200
I've missed this.

255
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,280
If that bastard says anything about
you guys again, I'll smash his face in.

256
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,520
Who?

257
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,280
- Samuel.
- What has he been saying?

258
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,320
- Nothing. A load of bullshit.
- Come on, tell us.

259
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,160
- Are you sure you want to know?
- Yes, I am.

260
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,160
How do I tell you this?

261
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,720
That you killed my sister.

262
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,400
Really?

263
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,120
Couldn't he have made up anything else?

264
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,256
No, it's not a joke.
The son of a bitch says it seriously.

265
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,400
Fucking hell.

266
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,600
What do you want?

267
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,040
Right.

268
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,520
- Your phone.
- What for?

269
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,736
It's the only way of knowing
that you're not recording me.

270
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,080
It doesn't matter.
I could get a confession from you

271
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,120
saying that you killed Marina
with your own hands,

272
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,840
and they'd tell me the same shit.

273
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,416
That you don't fit the profile.

274
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,160
That's the way the world works,
in case you hadn't noticed, you idiot.

275
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,920
Why are you so angry?

276
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,880
- You tricked me.
- You've been tricking me from the start.

277
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,440
- And don't you hate me for that?
- No.

278
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,040
- Anyway, that's it. You won. Congrats.
- No.

279
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,960
- We have both lost.
- What have you lost?

280
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,400
You.

281
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,760
For a moment, I started to believe
something could happen between us.

282
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,200
Something real.

283
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,920
That we could trust one another,

284
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,800
go out to dinner like everyone else,

285
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,640
without having to hide every time.

286
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,760
Although, now and then, we'd stay here

287
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,640
so you could make me your macaroni.

288
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,600
Which, by the way, is disgusting.

289
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,480
I don't know...

290
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,520
I even thought for a moment
that we could forget about all this shit

291
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,960
and that we could have a future.

292
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,440
How stupid of me, huh?

293
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,600
Good evening. How are you?

294
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,160
Hey, good evening.

295
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,216
Are you really going to put on a show
because of Guzmán?

296
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,960
After what happened with Nadia?

297
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,960
You said it. It happened.

298
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,440
You can go on holiday
to an exotic location,

299
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,240
but in the end, you always come back home.

300
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,200
Sure.

301
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,120
And Guzmán and I...
will always be Guzmán and I.

302
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,280
Good night.

303
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,960
At least put it on silent.

304
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,880
Omar is sleeping.

305
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,400
Poor kid, he only got back an hour ago.

306
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,440
Mom, I'm staying home today.
I have a really bad headache.

307
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,840
He's not answering.

308
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,240
Polo.

309
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,320
- Do you know something about Ander?
- What?

310
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,600
- Do you know something about Ander?
- No idea.

311
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,840
Fucking great.

312
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,320
- Okay, let's see. Ambassador?
- Yes.

313
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,240
Me?

314
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,456
I talked to them this morning,
and they thought it was a great idea.

315
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,560
You are making a huge effort.
You deserve it.

316
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,560
Yes, okay, but you deserve it more.

317
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,120
Me, in the spotlight...

318
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,640
- I'm not good at public speaking.
- Come on!

319
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,280
You're really good at it.

320
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,440
You will have to give a little speech,
the interview and pose for some photos.

321
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,520
You don't mind, do you?

322
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,120
Of course! Let's see now.

323
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,720
But I am sorry
that you won't take any credit.

324
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,280
- You took care of it and...
- It's okay.

325
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,840
Are you sure you don't want
your mom to know?

326
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,640
I'm sure, okay?
I'm going to finish my homework.

327
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,440
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

328
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,000
I wanted to ask you a huge favor.

329
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,040
I want to surprise my bestie, Cayetana,
and I need her mom's phone number.

330
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,720
Could you help me, please?

331
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,640
I love your glasses! They are wonderful.

332
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,520
- Thanks.
- They look so good on you.

333
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,320
Phone number.

334
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,840
Shit...

335
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,280
Want some?

336
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,040
Better than last time?

337
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,640
That wouldn't be too hard.

338
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,880
Next time, you'll be amazed.

339
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,696
The first thing we do is
remove the determinant from the matrix.

340
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,120
- Nadia...
- But if it's not a square matrix...

341
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,440
- Nadia.
- What?

342
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,400
I'm here.

343
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,840
Hi.

344
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,520
Do I disgust you so much?

345
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,800
Is that question part of the exam?

346
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,120
You can't even look me in the eye.

347
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,640
But you don't mind giving me lessons
as long as I'm still paying you.

348
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,600
I guess
your moral high ground has a price.

349
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,360
But I'm the one that's fucked up.

350
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,360
Lu has always been by my side.

351
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,400
She is everything to me.

352
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,816
- And she feels the same way about...
- Seriously, Valerio. We're here to study.

353
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,800
I don't want to know any more, okay?

354
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,560
Shit, Ander!

355
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,560
You can't blame someone for how they feel.

356
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,720
I'll be right back. Keep studying.

357
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,440
Sure.

358
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,560
Hi, Guzmán. Are you okay?

359
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,920
- Fucking hell...
- What?

360
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Nadia, don't give me any more
of the "I'm your friend," bullshit,

361
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,160
as if nothing ever happened.
I'm sick of it.

362
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,720
- Excuse me?
- Stop messing with me.

363
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,640
I don't want to mess with you.

364
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,296
Okay, then, try not messing with me
some other time. I have to train.

365
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,040
Okay, you're right.
I used an excuse to come over.

366
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,000
- There...
- But because I want to talk to you.

367
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,800
- Okay.
- Guzmán!

368
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,400
I have to go get changed.

369
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,160
Look where I am
for you to take me seriously.

370
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,760
I will die if someone comes in here.

371
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,160
Great, I'm all ears.

372
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,600
I know that we're always on and off...

373
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,960
You're the one who's on and off.

374
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,680
Yes, of course,
as if you had always been sure.

375
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,600
What are you doing?

376
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,520
You open your heart
and I'll open my shirt.

377
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,080
Stop it, come on. I can't concentrate.

378
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,920
There is nothing new to see down here.

379
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
So...

380
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,240
You were saying
we're always on and off. Go on.

381
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,960
Nadia...

382
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,720
If you think leaving Lu and turning up
at your store is not being sure,

383
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,320
tell me, what have you done
to show me that you are?

384
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,240
Apart from coming in here...

385
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,520
I'm trying.

386
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,240
Then try harder.

387
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,720
Shit...

388
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,520
Nadia, this is not a good place
to have sex.

389
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,120
Some people love watching.

390
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,160
- Hey.
- Hi.

391
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,840
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

392
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,280
What? What's wrong?

393
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,560
No, no... I know this silence.

394
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,040
It's the one that comes
before you run away.

395
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,560
No...

396
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,160
Not this time.

397
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,280
Are you sure?

398
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,400
I am.

399
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,280
And your family?

400
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,560
Compared to my brother and sister,

401
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,400
me being with a Christian isn't that bad.

402
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,440
That's true.

403
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,200
After last night, I feel sick. Don't you?

404
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,600
Guzmán doesn't believe Samuel.

405
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,800
The only way to change opinion
is if you keep...

406
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,760
If I keep what?

407
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,680
Feeling like shit every second
and every minute of every day?

408
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,600
- I'm only asking you to...
- I can't!

409
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,240
I can't lie to his face.

410
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,600
All right. Tell him the truth.

411
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,560
Tell him the truth.

412
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,000
Do you know what the truth is?

413
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,160
You've been lying to him for months.

414
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,480
Do you think he will forgive you?

415
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,600
You'll be dead to him.

416
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,800
I will end up in prison,
and Guzmán will have no friends left.

417
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,120
And for what?

418
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,800
So that you can keep a clear conscience?

419
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,000
Because Samuel's brother doesn't need it.

420
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,600
Right now, he's probably
drinking piña coladas in the Caribbean.

421
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,640
Ander, look at me.

422
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,680
Hold on.

423
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,400
Hold on a little longer.
Just a little longer.

424
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,960
All this will pass.

425
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,080
And we will go back to how we were.

426
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,040
That's what Guzmán
has been wanting for months,

427
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,800
for everything to go back to how it was.

428
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Hi.

429
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,200
There it is.

430
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,280
Thank you, handsome.

431
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,600
By the way...

432
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,240
Rebeca already told me.

433
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,000
If you're going to quit working for me
because of that boy from the club,

434
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,760
you have nothing to worry about.

435
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,840
I already talked to him.

436
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,040
I'll leave them here on the bar.

437
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,680
Hey, where's Marcos?
I'm doing everything here by myself.

438
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,000
Haven't you heard?

439
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,640
No... What?

440
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,920
<i>He got beaten up.</i>

441
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,096
They don't know why, and he can't say.
He's still unconscious in the hospital.

442
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,320
Fucking hell. It was Sandra.
Or someone who works for her. I'm sure.

443
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,880
Fucking hell, Samuel.
What if his friends want revenge?

444
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,600
These people know where you live.

445
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,720
I'll call you later.

446
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,240
Shit!

447
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,440
Come on, pick up.
Pick up the phone, damn it!

448
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,440
<i>The number you are calling
is switched off...</i>

449
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,520
Fuck!

450
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,760
Mom!

451
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,960
- What's wrong?
- Shit...

452
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,096
You could have picked up the phone!

453
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,840
Sorry, I didn't realize...

454
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,240
You must have called me
when I was talking to the police.

455
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,320
They rang the buzzer downstairs
and said it was the mailman.

456
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,920
And I looked out the window
and saw some guys that looked like...

457
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,560
Well, as though they gave out beatings,
not letters.

458
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,816
Of course, I didn't let them in,

459
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,560
but they wouldn't leave
until I said I was calling the police.

460
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,680
They came for your brother, I'm sure.

461
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,400
He can't even leave us in peace
when he's a thousand kilometers away.

462
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,080
How was your day?

463
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,600
Samuel?

464
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,360
Samuel, I'm talking to you!

465
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,120
- I'll be back later.
- Later?

466
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,200
I'll be back later!

467
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,080
Great.

468
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,680
Thank you.

469
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,880
She'll give the speech later.
But leave it centered for later, okay?

470
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,040
Tell the DJ to keep it smooth.

471
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,440
- Okay. I'll tell him right away.
- Okay. Thanks.

472
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,840
You good?

473
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,040
Good.

474
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,840
Yeah, great.

475
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,800
Guzmán went back
to that exotic location today.

476
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,960
Maybe he wants to move there forever.

477
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,440
Dad...

478
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,680
It's very nice.

479
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,280
What is?

480
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,560
The hijab.

481
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,720
When did you buy it?

482
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,440
It was a gift.

483
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,400
Really? From who?

484
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,080
A friend.

485
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,720
Go down to the shop.
Your mother has to make dinner.

486
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:38,120
You have to come round for dinner.
We've barely seen you lately.

487
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,400
I know...
The exam period is always complicated.

488
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,080
You know I'm really hardworking.

489
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,240
Well, it's over now.

490
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,680
What are you doing for Christmas?
Come to Asturias!

491
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,560
- Yes, come to Asturias.
- That's right.

492
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,440
All my family is coming from Mexico.

493
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,520
- My brother and my father are here so...
- Lu.

494
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,760
- Do you want a drink?
- Sure, darling.

495
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,760
- Yes?
- Please... Thanks.

496
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,160
How he looks after me.

497
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,560
- Hey! Where've you been?
- Hey.

498
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,920
Sorry, man.

499
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,136
I've been running back and forth between
the bathroom and my bed all the morning.

500
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,200
And are you all right now?

501
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,240
Much better.

502
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,360
So...

503
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,760
I'm glad you came.

504
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,400
So? How is it going?

505
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,880
- Oh, my God...
- What?

506
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,680
- It's unbelievable.
- Is it going well?

507
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,840
How are you doing?

508
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,760
And how is the fundraising going?

509
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,800
Better than I could have ever dreamed.

510
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,800
It's going well.
Are you having a good time?

511
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,696
We are. It's very admirable,
what you're doing.

512
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,920
It's much more than that. It's amazing,
how she's managed all this...

513
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,440
Hello?

514
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,520
Yes?

515
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,640
<i>Hello, this morning
I received a call from this number.</i>

516
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,720
Yes? I don't know, who's speaking?

517
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,800
<i>Victoria.</i>

518
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,240
<i>Well, I work in domestic service.</i>

519
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,240
<i>Maybe someone gave you my number</i>

520
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,600
<i>because you wanted me
to clean your house or something or...</i>

521
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,680
What?

522
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,280
Are you Cayetana's mother?

523
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,920
Lu! Shit... What's going on?
Have you seen a ghost?

524
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,560
Come with me.

525
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,080
How could I not have figured this out?

526
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,000
She has thousands of followers
on Instagram! How did she...

527
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,200
The Burberry she brought the other day
was a dupe?

528
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,800
She must have bought them.

529
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,120
With what money?
She's the fucking cleaner's daughter.

530
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,080
Fucking hell...

531
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,160
Lu...

532
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,880
What account are the guests' donations
being paid into?

533
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,040
Holy cow.

534
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,480
All these people are here because of me.

535
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,920
Not because of her.
I'll teach her what I'm capable of...

536
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,456
- Fucking bitch.
- Listen to me. Don't.

537
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,440
Listen. Don't make a scene.
It'd be a scandal and not just for her.

538
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,560
Calm down, wait till the party is over.

539
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,280
Tomorrow you can discreetly see
how people can get their money back.

540
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,680
For now, you need
to keep up appearances, okay?

541
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,120
I'd forgotten what it felt like
to have you worry about me.

542
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,800
Let's go.

543
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,560
- Where are you going?
- Fuck's sake.

544
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,800
I'm on the list.

545
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,640
Come on... You invited him?

546
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,320
Me? Why?

547
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,480
I know what's going on
between you guys, Carla.

548
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,360
Do you really think I'm so naïve?

549
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,720
I don't know, ask your friend Cayetana.

550
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,560
- You're not on the list.
- I must be. I know Cayetana Grajera.

551
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,480
What are you doing?

552
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,520
- What's he doing here?
- You tell me.

553
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,560
Tell him to leave. I'm sick of him!

554
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,600
Did you know
he's been talking shit to Guzmán?

555
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,040
And now he suspects us!

556
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,280
He's doing what?

557
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,920
Carla?

558
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,080
Carla...

559
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,960
- He's with me. Don't worry.
- Shit!

560
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,616
What are you doing here?
You have to leave now.

561
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,640
Where's Rebeca?

562
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,136
Leave right now. I'm asking you, please.

563
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,120
"Please"? And why are you so concerned?

564
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,200
Samuel...

565
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,760
So what?
This whole thing is for poor children?

566
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,800
I'm the one at risk all the time.

567
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,280
Okay, yes, I did tell her about it.

568
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,296
Because I wanted her to swear on her life
that nothing would happen to you.

569
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,280
And that guy ended up in hospital
because of you.

570
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,656
You've been watching too many movies.

571
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,520
Now you're the one who doesn't want
to see what's right under your nose.

572
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,200
What do we care that the guy got
a good beating? Maybe he deserved it.

573
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,616
He'll want to pay us back in kind.

574
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,280
And I don't have bodyguards,
a bulletproof car or a security system.

575
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,600
You said
there was no danger in all of this!

576
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,696
If something happens
to my mother, to Omar or to me...

577
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,480
- What?
- It all will be your fault!

578
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,280
Azucena, where's the inspector?
I need to talk to her.

579
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,760
- They have arrested someone, Omar.
- Who?

580
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,280
Polo, it's all done.

581
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,960
I've got enough for everything.

582
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,280
This is crazy!

583
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,480
I'm happy for you.

584
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,160
- So happy.
- Cayetana.

585
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,600
Can we finish this now?

586
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,200
This has been a huge success.

587
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,640
I couldn't have done it without you.
Oh, my God!

588
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,280
Stop saying that, please.

589
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,000
- I'm being serious, I love you!
- Excuse me.

590
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,800
Weren't you going to give a speech, Lu?

591
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,040
- Only if you want.
- No...

592
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,760
Come on, girl, if you promised,
don't snub Cayetana.

593
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,400
I don't have anything prepared.

594
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,680
It'll be my pleasure.

595
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,680
Hello?

596
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,400
<i>Good evening.</i>

597
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,560
<i>Well...</i>

598
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,400
<i>Thank you sincerely
for being here tonight.</i>

599
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,440
<i>Thank you for your kindness,
from the bottom of my heart.</i>

600
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,280
<i>It's hard to believe that there are still
good people in the world who we can trust.</i>

601
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,240
<i>And thank you especially
to a wonderful woman...</i>

602
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,160
<i>A generous and very special friend.</i>

603
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,120
<i>Cayetana, please, let's give her a hand.</i>

604
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,120
<i>No, no... Please, don't.</i>

605
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,360
Thank you.

606
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,200
<i>And a fucking liar.</i>

607
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,960
<i>Does this NGO even exist?</i>

608
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:58,680
<i>It must be as false as your stories
about trips around the world...</i>

609
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,640
<i>Your house.</i>

610
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,240
<i>Your friendship.</i>

611
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,936
<i>Your Ralph Lauren dress.
I don't know who you stole that from.</i>

612
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,920
- Lu, please...
- <i>And your followers on Instagram.</i>

613
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,960
<i>Your whole life is a fucking lie.</i>

614
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,680
<i>Yes, Cayetana is the daughter
of a house cleaner.</i>

615
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,720
<i>I really believed her.</i>

616
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,680
<i>Well done.</i>

617
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,400
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

618
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,160
<i>It was all a big lie.</i>

619
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,640
<i>Don't worry, she'll give you
your money back, I'll make sure of that.</i>

620
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,720
<i>Great night. I'm sick of it.
Sick of pretending.</i>

621
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,080
<i>Putting on a fake smile all night long,</i>

622
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,840
<i>pretending that everything was all right.</i>

623
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,240
<i>But nothing is all right.</i>

624
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,760
<i>Especially with Guzmán.</i>

625
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,680
<i>We are finished.</i>

626
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,080
<i>I'm sorry, Laura. I really tried.</i>

627
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,160
<i>But it didn't work out.</i>

628
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,160
<i>It was too hard.</i>

629
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:25,680
<i>Because your sweet boy
cheated on me with a Bedouin girl.</i>

630
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,320
<i>Yes, he cheated on me. Can you believe it?</i>

631
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,760
<i>I don't know how I do it,
but I always end up betrayed</i>

632
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:40,720
<i>and disappointed by the very people
that I have fully supported. Right, Carla?</i>

633
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,160
<i>But I'm done.</i>

634
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,400
<i>You are all mistaken if you think...</i>

635
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,240
<i>you can take me for a fool
and get away with it.</i>

636
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,960
<i>Because that won't happen.</i>

637
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,520
<i>So now I want to toast</i>

638
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,000
<i>to this wonderful night.</i>

639
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,480
<i>Carla is fucking Samuel.</i>

640
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,560
What?

641
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,560
<i>Cheers.</i>

642
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,520
Don't be long. Go to bed soon.

643
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,840
Dad...

644
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,480
Yes, my dear?

645
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,640
I didn't tell you the truth earlier.

646
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:01,720
What?

647
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,280
The hijab.

648
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,480
It's not from a friend.

649
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,520
And I want to be honest with you.

650
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,920
I don't want to hide anything.
I don't want to have to hide.

651
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,120
What are you talking about?

652
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
This hijab...

653
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,520
HEY DARLING, IT'S LU.
THIS MIGHT BE OF INTEREST TO YOU.

654
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,240
What's going on, Nadia?

655
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,360
Nothing, Dad. Nothing.

656
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Good night.

657
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,120
What do you mean, "nothing"?

658
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,560
Don't be long. Go to bed soon.

659
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,280
IT'S POSTED ON THE INTERNET.

660
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:52,040
THE WHOLE SCHOOL WILL HAVE SEEN IT BY NOW.

661
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,840
Are you leaving?

662
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,600
Yes, there's not much to do here anymore.

663
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,280
I'm sorry. What a mess.

664
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,360
Don't worry. I knew this would happen.

665
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,360
The truth always comes out
in the end, right?

666
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,240
Let's go.

667
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,400
Ander.

668
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,160
What?

669
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,440
Look me in the eye.

670
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,680
What?

671
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,680
Did Polo kill Marina?

672
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,160
What are you saying?

673
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,840
Ander, for crying out loud, look me
in the eye and answer this question.

674
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,480
Did Polo kill Marina?

675
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:08,720
No.

676
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,400
Of course not.

677
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,360
Shit, okay.

678
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,240
I'm sorry.

679
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,400
Fucking hell...

680
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,320
Sorry, man.
Please, don't think I'm crazy.

681
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,360
I couldn't get it out of my head.
I had to ask. I couldn't help it anymore.

682
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,720
Please, don't tell Polo about this.

683
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,040
Can I trust you?

684
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,200
Of course.

685
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:56,880
Well...

686
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,040
Pick up...

687
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,960
Samuel, pick up.

688
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,200
Fuck.
