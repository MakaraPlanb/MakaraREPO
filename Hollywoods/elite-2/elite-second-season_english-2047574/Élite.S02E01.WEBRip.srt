1
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,640
He was last seen last night.

2
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,400
He is 17 years of age.

3
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,120
20 HOURS MISSING

4
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,040
He was wearing his Las Encinas uniform
when he disappeared.

5
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,120
Maroon pants.

6
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,040
White shirt, gray or blue blazer
with a red trim on the lapel.

7
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,560
You know how important
these first few hours are,

8
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,200
so let's get to work, team.

9
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,560
THREE MONTHS EARLIER

10
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,600
Did you get my present?

11
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,520
What is it?

12
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,600
Some cheese.

13
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,280
They say it's the shit.

14
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,440
Or at least expensive shit.

15
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,440
You can shove it up your ass, Christian.

16
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,200
Did you have fun vacationing
with the marchioness?

17
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,280
I'm sorry, Nano.

18
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,440
- I should have come sooner.
- You know what?

19
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,280
Marina had that watch on her.

20
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
However, when I arrived,

21
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,440
it was gone.

22
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,280
Maybe your girlfriend was involved.

23
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,400
Maybe she even did it.

24
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,080
Don't tell me
you haven't thought about it.

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,080
But of course...

26
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,600
as long as your trips,
seafood, and fancy watches are paid for...

27
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,760
- none of that matters to you, does it?
- No.

28
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,720
It does matter.

29
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,760
- It was a shitty vacation.
- I bet.

30
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,880
I'm going to the pool.
Let me know when we're leaving.

31
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,440
Hi, darling!

32
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,160
I'm here to show the girl the house.

33
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,240
What?

34
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,920
What do you say?

35
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,560
I don't know.
It looked uglier in the photo.

36
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,760
Don't start, huh?

37
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,920
We'll need to paint it
and make it our own.

38
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,280
You'll see how good it looks.
It's going to be awesome here.

39
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,000
Yes!

40
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,400
Here we go again.

41
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,360
It's 8:00 a.m., Valerio.

42
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,160
Breakfast is the most important meal
of the day. Want some?

43
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,440
No, I don't eat breakfast.

44
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,760
Ander!

45
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,040
Hi, gorgeous!

46
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,920
Did you want me to give up
on the first day of school?

47
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,120
I'm on fire now.

48
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,040
I see. I thought boarding school
had changed you.

49
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,040
It doesn't seem that way.
It's made you even more ridiculous.

50
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,960
Thanks for that.

51
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,960
If I were you,
I'd try to pass this year.

52
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,360
Otherwise, Mom and Dad will cut you off.
And you weren't born to be poor.

53
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,120
I'm not worried.
Whatever happens, I'll always have you.

54
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,400
I'm being serious. Thank you...

55
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,840
Thank you for still worrying about me,
because everyone else has given up.

56
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,800
It's my penance as your sister.

57
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,040
Half sister, gorgeous.

58
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,320
Hi, baby!

59
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,080
What did you do to your hair?
That was unexpected.

60
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,400
We could go to your house after class.

61
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,200
I planned, no actually...
I sort of came up with a game...

62
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,440
- ...if you don't get distracted.
- You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

63
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,000
WE LOVE YOU, MARINA

64
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,720
WE WILL NEVER FORGET YOU

65
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
They could throw all this trash away.

66
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,160
What happened to the watch?
What's wrong, don't you like it?

67
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,640
We can go and exchange it.

68
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,520
How are you?

69
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,480
How was Croatia? Did Christian like it?

70
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,000
Polo, we need to talk.

71
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,680
- What's wrong?
- I think Christian went to see Nano, and...

72
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,096
I'm going to see the others.
We'll talk later.

73
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,960
By the way...
I'm really glad to see you this happy.

74
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,040
For real.

75
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,240
How are you? Long time no see.

76
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,280
- Hey.
- How are you doing?

77
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,120
- You didn't post a single photo.
- There's barely any signal

78
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,040
at his grandparents' house in Asturias.

79
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,440
A cow is a cow,
no matter how many filters you use on it.

80
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,680
It was sort of like a detox...

81
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,640
- What are you doing here?
- I have as much right as you do

82
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,960
- to be here.
- Guzmán!

83
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,160
- Don't!
- Stop!

84
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,240
Azucena!

85
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,280
- Go the fuck back home!
- Get off!

86
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,120
- Don't!
- Stop!

87
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,960
- Stop now!
- Stop being an idiot!

88
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,160
- Stop!
- Guzmán! Get off of him!

89
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,400
- Enough!
- Guzmán, stop!

90
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,600
Our wounds from Marina's death
will take a long time to heal.

91
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,480
I will need your help with the process.

92
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,760
All of you.

93
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,680
Guzmán,

94
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,800
I can't even begin to imagine
what you are going through.

95
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,000
No, you can't.

96
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,040
And now imagine
you had to bump into the one responsible

97
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,880
for that pain in the halls.

98
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,360
Samuel isn't the one to blame.

99
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,680
If Samuel hadn't come to this school...

100
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,280
If he and his fucking brother had stayed
in their town, where they belonged,

101
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,976
- none of this would've happened.
- Your father got him the scholarship.

102
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,240
And you renewed it. Why?

103
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,720
He's a good student. It wouldn't be fair.

104
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,040
Fair?

105
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,600
Marina is dead.

106
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,280
My sister...

107
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,400
is dead at 16 years old.

108
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,200
Is that fair?

109
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm not going to argue with you.

110
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:42,000
From now on, just so you know, if you talk
to the fucking waiter, you are dead to me!

111
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,760
It's him or me.

112
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,880
This is not about taking sides.

113
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,200
Yes, it is.
And you have already chosen yours.

114
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,920
Over here. One question.

115
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Valerio...

116
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,880
- Is it important?
- Sure.

117
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,760
Isn't there supposed to be a welcome party
or something here?

118
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,360
- You think we're in the mood to party?
- Have you seen these faces?

119
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,520
Look at this.

120
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,720
Especially after something
as awful as this, these people need...

121
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,160
to have fun.

122
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,480
To have fun, dance, drink...

123
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,880
Why didn't he go back to his mother?

124
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,120
Because she doesn't know
what to do with him.

125
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,880
She sends him off to our dad
whenever she can.

126
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,880
Then, Dad gets fed up after a few months

127
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,720
and sends him back.
It's been like this forever.

128
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,520
It must be tough.

129
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,080
When your parents are divorced
and they send you back and forth

130
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,000
over the Atlantic like a tennis ball.

131
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,880
Yeah, sure. It's the first day,
and the guy already wants to party.

132
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
I'll go with him.

133
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,720
Someone has to make sure
that when he passes out in a drunken coma,

134
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,600
he at least has a cushion to fall onto,

135
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,240
and his wallet in his pocket
the next morning.

136
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,880
Now you're the big sister?

137
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,120
With Valerio? She always has been.

138
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,720
Remember how jealous I used to get
about all the time they spent together?

139
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,960
What for? He's hopeless. Look at him...

140
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,480
- To the field!
- Better put your phone away.

141
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,840
If you get caught using it,
they'll confiscate it.

142
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,200
- Are you a scholarship student?
- See this? Pure gold, kid.

143
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,840
You must be rich,
but you aren't like all the rest.

144
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,120
- And proud of it. Got a problem with that?
- It was a compliment.

145
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,520
Everyone get in!

146
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,120
Rebeca. With a "c."

147
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,120
- But my friends call me Rebe.
- Samuel.

148
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,400
Get into groups of five
with both boys and girls.

149
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,360
We're going to start with dynamic drills.

150
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,440
Hey, come here!

151
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,880
Hey, girl. I'm Rebe.

152
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,376
Don't worry. I get on fine with Muslims.
In my neighborhood, I've screwed them all.

153
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,520
Let's warm up! Take your time.

154
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,320
We need two more over here.

155
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,960
You two, get over there.

156
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,240
- Second group, get ready.
- Hey, Samu. Your brother says hi.

157
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,760
You couldn't go to see him?

158
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,360
I was working like a dog
to try to pay his fucking bail.

159
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,280
What about you?

160
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,600
Cruise with your girlfriend
on your private yacht?

161
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,160
One...

162
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,680
two... three...

163
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,240
He will tell people everything.
He has barely spoken these past months.

164
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,760
Like he was afraid that if one word
slipped out, the whole truth would follow.

165
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,160
So, what now?

166
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,480
What?

167
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,600
Damn. You're intense.

168
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,960
Seriously, you need a vacation.

169
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,880
Relax. He knows what's good for him.

170
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,800
Are you going out tonight?

171
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,280
- Polo, are you all right?
- Me?

172
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,680
Better than ever!

173
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,920
Why did you snitch?

174
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,440
I thought we were okay.
I thought you were my friend.

175
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,960
So did I,

176
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,920
but you got a girlfriend
and stopped answering my messages.

177
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,040
Got a girlfriend?

178
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,200
Lu has been by my side all summer
in the North.

179
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,040
Do you know why I'm with her?
Because she always supports me.

180
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,920
Unconditionally.

181
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,320
That is not love.

182
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,880
It's devotion,

183
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,400
like you would have to a God.

184
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,920
People that love you
will tell you the truth.

185
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,640
That Marina's death won't justify
you acting wild for much longer.

186
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,600
Do you know
that you're at this school thanks to me?

187
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,400
I made a pact with your father.

188
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,960
I'd stop talking to you,
and he'd let you stay.

189
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,480
That's why I didn't answer your messages.

190
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
You're welcome.

191
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,160
I had a hard time convincing him
to let me come back.

192
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,280
I'm not a princess
who needs to be rescued,

193
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,000
and you're certainly no prince.

194
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,880
I don't need you.

195
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,840
You want a picture or what?

196
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,520
I'd go back to my neighborhood
in a heartbeat.

197
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,160
Why did you leave?

198
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,200
We won the lottery.

199
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,560
Shit.

200
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,360
What a bummer.

201
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,400
- Are you going to that club?
<i>- </i>I don't think I'd be very welcome.

202
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,480
Are you going to let them decide for you?

203
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,560
I'm going.

204
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,080
You? You’re willingly going to a club?

205
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,080
Why not?

206
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,400
I'm up for it.

207
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,680
Fuck those rich snobs, right?

208
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,400
Omar.

209
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,040
Where are you going?
Won't you help me with these boxes?

210
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,200
I made plans to meet Samuel
for a quick coffee.

211
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,520
Only 15 minutes, please.

212
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,120
Where's Nadia?

213
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,480
She went to study at a friend's house.
Some girl called Rebeca.

214
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,360
Go.

215
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,000
<i>The club is fucking sweet.</i>

216
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,880
And we're going to have a VIP area
reserved for us.

217
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,600
What, don't you want to be a VIP?

218
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,160
Ten minutes a day,
every afternoon isn't enough.

219
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,360
I know.

220
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,000
- Everybody knows each other here.
- Everybody knows your father.

221
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,360
When the hell
are you gonna talk to him?

222
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,640
I already talked to mine.

223
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,080
Are you going to compare our families?

224
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,160
No, your father is a dictator.
That's why you have to stand up to him.

225
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,840
How will you tell him that you like guys
or to let you out of the house

226
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,760
if you can't ask him
if you can go out tonight?

227
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,400
But why are you so insistent
that I go out tonight?

228
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,296
Because I want to kiss you in a club
in front of people, like everyone else.

229
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,120
I don't want to look over my shoulder
every time I go near you.

230
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,680
I want to feel free around you,
for fuck's sake.

231
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,200
This whole forbidden love thing was fun
for a while, but I'm tired of it.

232
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,120
What time?

233
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,280
Dad?

234
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,160
Dad?

235
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,960
Dad!

236
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,880
Dad!

237
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,920
BARCELÓ THEATER

238
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,040
Nadia.

239
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,360
How is it going?

240
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,240
- Have you been waiting for long?
- Twenty minutes, and we're not moving.

241
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,560
Check out the outfit.
Do you know that you look like a pharaoh?

242
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,800
Let's go.

243
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,480
Enjoy the line, guys.

244
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,680
Good evening, sir.

245
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,720
We're on the list of...

246
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,560
What was his name?

247
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,640
Valerio.

248
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,400
Come on, let's get a drink now!

249
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,080
What are you doing here?
Let's step outside.

250
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,440
Relax.

251
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,920
Let's talk about this like adults.

252
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,560
Or at least over a drink. Follow me.

253
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,840
You can see the bar is huge.
You can order whatever you want.

254
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,840
They know who I am.

255
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,720
Let him go downstairs,
where I can't see him!

256
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,840
- Guzmán!
- You think I want to see you?

257
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,160
- What? I can't hear you.
- Maybe you'll hear this.

258
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,920
I'm not to blame for Marina's death!
My brother didn't kill her.

259
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,320
Really? So who did?
Blow our minds, champ! Who killed her?

260
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,680
I don't know! I'm not a detective,
but at least I'm trying to find out!

261
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,080
You know who are detectives?

262
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,480
The ones who put your brother in prison,
where he'll rot.

263
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,536
I hope they crack his head open,
so he knows how it feels.

264
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,840
- Guzmán!
- That's enough.

265
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,080
Fucking hell, Ander!

266
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,320
Valerio, could you please
take care of this?

267
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,016
- Leave him alone. He's a good kid.
- Sure! He's your boyfriend's pal.

268
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,760
How brave you've become.
You're taking his side, right?

269
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,520
Guzmán, you're my best friend.
Here's a word of advice:

270
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,680
stop forcing people to take sides.
You'll end up finding yourself alone.

271
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:56,680
23 HOURS MISSING

272
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
Inspector.

273
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,960
Excuse me.

274
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,480
Why are we looking here?

275
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,960
We know that he left
the party around 10:00.

276
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,520
He took this road,
and that was the last time he was seen.

277
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,240
Inspector! This way!

278
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,120
We found something!

279
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,080
- I don't like seeing you like this.
- Well...

280
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,160
Let's see if you can pull a few
of my strings and make me smile.

281
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,720
That's why you want me
by your side, right?

282
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,000
So you can control me like a puppet.

283
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,800
Christian, I'm not with you
because of what happened.

284
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,840
Before that day, I had already kissed you,

285
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,320
fucked you,

286
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,560
and laughed at all your bad jokes.

287
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,800
I already really liked you.

288
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,360
Why can't we go back
to the way we were before?

289
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,800
Because Nano wasn't in prison
because of me before.

290
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,160
They have no evidence against him.

291
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,320
He will most likely be released.

292
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,800
Bullshit.

293
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,920
Prison is full of people like Nano.

294
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,720
His only crime is not having the dough
to hire a decent and capable lawyer.

295
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,840
So what about you?

296
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,480
Do you want to end up like him?

297
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,920
Because if you admit that you lied,
you will be an accessory to murder.

298
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,280
You know that, right?

299
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,720
Why throw it all away?
You have such a great future ahead of you.

300
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,000
He was thinking
of telling you himself, but...

301
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,640
My father has got you a place

302
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,880
at one of the best universities
in the United States, in New York.

303
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:57,560
You won't need to worry about your grades.
It's the chance of a lifetime.

304
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,920
Life is a real bitch.

305
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,680
If I have to betray my brother
in order to achieve that,

306
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,560
that's not life. It's nothing.

307
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,840
It's unbelievable that you had him
as your boy toy for the summer...

308
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,720
But how long is your relationship
with that Neanderthal going to last?

309
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,720
It's over.

310
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,240
MOM

311
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,360
That ain't your color.

312
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,160
I've got one that could look
totally Gucci on you. Here.

313
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,480
Relax. Not the one I'm wearing.
Not everyone can pull this off.

314
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,200
I guess it will sound ridiculous to you,

315
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,440
but I think
I'm doing something I shouldn't.

316
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,480
I know.

317
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,960
But doesn't it feel good?

318
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,040
What?

319
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,400
I'm not paying an arm and a leg
for a rum and coke.

320
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,000
I might be rich, but I'm not an idiot.

321
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,720
They don't give it a rest.

322
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,040
It's never to your face,
always behind your back.

323
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,080
If it was behind my back, I'd be happy.

324
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,320
When are you going to answer him
with a good slap?

325
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,680
What should I do,
sign up for tae kwon do classes?

326
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,480
I'd need to win the lottery, too.

327
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,080
I will teach you how to box.

328
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,200
Boxing? You?

329
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,320
What does he think?

330
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,960
- Come here, you smartass.
- What are you doing?

331
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:50,360
What do you mean "what am I doing"?
I'm going to teach you.

332
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,960
- I even have a punching bag for training.
- Where?

333
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,560
In the basement at home.

334
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,080
I'll think about it.

335
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:03,600
Sure... My house is haunted, right?

336
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,720
Dad, I don't know what to do.
I think he's going to talk.

337
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,880
Don't worry, darling.
Enjoy your night out.

338
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,280
The VIP area is here. All right?

339
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,800
I don't need that shit.

340
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Are you sure?

341
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,880
I think you're the one
that needs it the most.

342
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,240
What do you know?

343
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,960
Look, Guzmán.

344
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,960
The way I see it,
you have two options tonight.

345
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,640
You can be you... or you can be happy.

346
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:49,320
Listen, I'd screw that guy
after four beers.

347
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,320
That one, after two.

348
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,960
That one... Wow, I’d do him
after an alcohol-free beer.

349
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,720
I would even after a Diet Coke.

350
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,800
What about you?

351
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,080
I don't drink.
I wouldn't know how to play.

352
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,280
It's your loss.

353
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,720
What's in it?

354
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,360
A bottle of whiskey!

355
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,920
Sorry! I'm really sorry.

356
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,600
Oh my!
That's definitely a sign from above.

357
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,360
Well, he doesn't exactly look like
an angel sent from Heaven, if you ask me.

358
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,880
Tonight, I'll be anything you want.

359
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,960
An angel...

360
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,960
A demon... Anything you want.

361
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,520
- Wow, he's talking to me.
- Why wouldn't I?

362
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,936
For the same reason as your friends.

363
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,520
Because of where I'm from,
how I look...

364
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,120
I don't care about where you're from,
how you dress or whatever...

365
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,480
I'm not that superficial.
Who do you think I am?

366
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,280
The only thing that matters
to me is how hot you are.

367
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,040
Hi! We haven't been introduced.

368
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,840
- I'm Lu, Valerio's sister.
- Ignore her. Half sister.

369
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,560
Nadia, would you excuse us a moment?

370
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,640
Bye. I need to talk to him for a second.
Let's go.

371
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,840
I'll see you later.

372
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,040
Yeah, go talk to him away from here.
Can't let him catch lice.

373
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,360
Wait for me at the bar.

374
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,560
Do you think you can fool me?

375
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,120
Excuse me?

376
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,880
I've met people like you before.

377
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,240
- Have you?
- Yes.

378
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,960
They come from nothing,
suddenly they make a fortune

379
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,240
and buy a mansion...

380
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,560
They show up at school

381
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,320
looking like reggaeton singers
with 24 karat gold earrings.

382
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,400
Just like you.

383
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,520
And their families earned their money
through some shady business.

384
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,200
Practically always drugs.

385
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,320
Is this all because we ended up
with your boyfriend's house?

386
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,080
I don't know, maybe...
Call me crazy, but...

387
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,920
if they hadn't got into "shady business,"
they wouldn't have had to sell it.

388
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,160
Look, I'm not going
to give you any advice, gorgeous...

389
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,080
Don't go near my brother.

390
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,120
Of course... You people are against drugs.

391
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,600
When you go to the bathroom in threes,
it's to chat?

392
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,120
Of course.

393
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,480
We're hypocrites.
That's what we are really good at.

394
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,000
That's why you're so proud of your family
that you go around saying

395
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,080
that you won the lottery.

396
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,360
That's just classic.

397
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,160
Welcome.

398
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,480
How are you feeling?

399
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,560
Fine, but my parents are getting
a divorce.

400
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,840
- I think it's my fault.
- What?

401
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,000
Forget it.
I'm really glad to see you like this.

402
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,720
Fuck, yeah! The three of us all together!

403
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,520
Where are you going?

404
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,880
To do what I should've done
three months ago.

405
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,160
And what about me?
You don't care about me anymore?

406
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,320
You?

407
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,520
Go back to Polito.
You two are made for each other.

408
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,680
You're not coming, are you?
Fine, I'll find somebody else to kiss.

409
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,560
Nadia.

410
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,280
What did you give Guzmán?

411
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,320
Happiness.

412
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,920
You want some?

413
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,320
All you do is give me a headache, Valerio.

414
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,360
Don't even think about
doing something like this again.

415
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,800
What happened to you?

416
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,440
We used to have such a good time.

417
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,880
Did you forget about it all?

418
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,400
Christian!

419
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,560
Christian.

420
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,320
He had a severe stroke.

421
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,840
It'll take time for him
to get back to normal.

422
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,720
Where were you?

423
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,680
Why was your phone off?

424
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,200
I was studying.

425
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,080
With a girl from school, wasn't it?

426
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,480
Who is this boy?

427
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,240
What were you doing?

428
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,040
No, I... Don't worry. I'm not into girls.

429
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,840
But who are you?

430
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,280
- I'm a friend of...
- Nadia's.

431
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,880
He's a friend of Nadia's. From school.

432
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,800
What's that smell?

433
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,720
Mom, I haven't been drinking.

434
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,480
Yes, I did go to a club,
but somebody spilled their drink on me.

435
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,160
Why don't you stop lying once and for all?

436
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,400
It's no big deal
if she did have a drink, right?

437
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,040
You'd think she was a terrorist?

438
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:09,840
Sorry. I mean,
I have a lot of Muslim friends.

439
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,520
Fuck, shit.
I shouldn't say swear words either.

440
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,000
- You should go.
- Please.

441
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,640
- Omar, I just wanted...
- Get out of here!

442
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,200
I can't!

443
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,280
- Finally!
- This feels good.

444
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,040
Look.

445
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,320
I lost a sock.

446
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,920
Who loses a sock that easily?

447
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,800
I left with two. Now I have one.

448
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,400
But why?
How do you even go about losing a sock?

449
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,080
- Very easily.
- For real?

450
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,360
I can tell you a really good story.

451
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,800
I know a girl who went out on her own.

452
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,800
- I wasn't on my own.
- I'm the one telling this story.

453
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,320
She went out on her own

454
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,560
wearing a beautiful black lace bra.

455
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,680
Where did I put it?

456
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,160
When she got back home,
she wasn't wearing it anymore.

457
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:38,080
No, no. She wasn't wearing it
because you were wearing it!

458
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,040
- In fact...
- It looked fucking good on me!

459
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,560
You're crazy!

460
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,480
I missed this.

461
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,560
I missed you.

462
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,080
Really?

463
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,440
Always?

464
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,720
We said
that this would never happen again.

465
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,760
I'm your sister, Valerio.

466
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,240
Half sister.

467
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,920
Why don't you reply?

468
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:01,360
Let's go back to yesterday's subject.
Open your books to page 104, please.

469
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,680
Excuse me for a second.

470
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,360
Your classmate Christian...
had a motorbike accident last night.

471
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,520
What kind of accident?

472
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,240
It seems that he had been drinking
and he hit another vehicle.

473
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,960
- The car fled the scene.
- Did they say how he's doing?

474
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,920
Only that he's in critical condition.
He's been in surgery all night.

475
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:07,040
- What are you doing here?
- My father was admitted because...

476
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,280
- Luckily, it was just a scare.
- Do you know anything? About Christian?

477
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,080
The doctor just came.

478
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,160
He's alive.

479
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,920
Which is a miracle, apparently,
given how badly he was hit.

480
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,440
So will he be all right?

481
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,840
I don't know, Samuel.
The doctors say it's not looking good.

482
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,240
<i>What?</i>

483
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:29,760
He definitely won't walk again.
I don't know anything about this, Polo.

484
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,240
<i>It must have been an accident.</i>

485
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,960
<i>He was drunk.
Anyone could have run him over.</i>

486
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,520
<i>Are you still there? Anyone...</i>

487
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,800
Polo. What are you doing?

488
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,520
Are you all right?

489
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,560
Relax, man.

490
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,360
What's wrong?

491
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,680
Polo?

492
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,040
Polo, what the hell? Polo!

493
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,720
Polo. In the backpack.

494
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,160
- What's with the backpack?
- In the backpack.

495
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,320
What's in the backpack?

496
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,800
- My pills.
- Where?

497
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,360
Where are the pills? Shit.

498
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,240
Why do you have these?
How long have you been taking them?

499
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,400
How many?

500
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,200
Dad! What are you doing here?

501
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,840
I've come to see Christian.

502
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,200
They told us that they won't tell us
anything new till tomorrow.

503
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,040
You must have spoken to the wrong person.

504
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,720
I'm going to have to talk to him alone.

505
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,560
I think I can help him.

506
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,440
His parents have agreed.

507
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,600
- You...
- Can we go in after?

508
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,000
It'll be a long conversation,
and it's late.

509
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,520
- Why don't you guys go home to rest?
- I'm not tired.

510
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,000
You'd rather be tired
in class tomorrow?

511
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,960
I'm saying it for your own good.
And Christian's.

512
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,120
He and I have important things
to discuss that might help him.

513
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,360
Get some rest.

514
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,640
I'm not leaving until I can see Christian.

515
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,640
Maybe I didn't make myself clear enough,
kid.

516
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,520
Come back tomorrow.

517
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,560
Listen, you must have
a lot of friends here,

518
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,320
but you don't own this hospital. Not yet.

519
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,200
You don't decide who stays and who leaves.

520
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,800
And I'm staying.
Did I make myself clear enough?

521
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,320
I'm staying, too.

522
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,720
All of us.

523
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,200
And so am I...

524
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,320
I suppose.

525
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,480
What are they talking about?

526
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,240
Switzerland?

527
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,640
One of the best hospitals in the world.
They will operate on him tomorrow,

528
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,760
and then he will undergo
a few months of intensive rehabilitation.

529
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,920
Who knows?

530
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,120
So, is there a chance
that he will be able to walk again?

531
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,240
There always is.
Where there's a will, there's a way.

532
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,480
And where there's money.
Because that place is super expensive.

533
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,640
How will you afford it? I see...

534
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,120
I wish I had in-laws like that.

535
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,720
His parents are happy.

536
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,840
What about you?

537
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,560
How are you?

538
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,640
How do you think I am, Samu?

539
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,280
What the fuck do you want me to do?

540
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,720
What other option do I have?

541
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,160
Guys, it's very late.

542
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,960
And Christian has
an early flight tomorrow.

543
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,240
It's time to say goodbye.

544
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,560
As soon as he's feeling better,

545
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:15,040
we'll get you a couple of plane tickets
so you can visit him.

546
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,840
Champion.

547
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,800
Look after Samu for me, okay?

548
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,040
Don't worry about me.

549
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:23,840
I will.

550
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,400
Miss Acapulco...

551
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:32,640
I know you were crazy about me
from the start.

552
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,560
I'll give it to you when I get back.

553
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,080
Sooner or later, you will fall.

554
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,520
Someone will bring you down.

555
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:15,880
I hope I'll be well enough by then
to dance on your fucking grave.

556
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,120
It was all very strange.

557
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,280
Christian knew something.

558
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,920
I think so, too.

559
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,360
They bought his silence
with the clinic. I knew it!

560
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:03,960
It was all because of the marchioness
and that watch with the red strap...

561
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,360
I had nothing to do with it. Nothing!

562
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,360
Do you believe me now?

563
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,480
I never thought it was you, Nano.

564
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,480
So why didn't you visit me before?

565
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,720
Because Guzmán is right.

566
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,960
Even if you didn't hit Marina,

567
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,480
if they killed her for that watch,
they killed her because of you.

568
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,720
Because you stole it.

569
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,520
You decided to blackmail those people.

570
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,480
You gave it to Marina.

571
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,520
That's why I will never forgive you.

572
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,080
And you'll let me rot in here
for 20 years?

573
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,280
No, I won't.

574
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,120
I'm going to do everything I can
to get you out.

575
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,440
<i>And I'm not just talking
about paying bail.</i>

576
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,200
<i>I'm going to do everything I can...</i>

577
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,160
<i>to find those people and make them pay.</i>

578
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,520
<i>I swear I will see it through to the end.</i>

579
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,280
<i>No matter what it costs.</i>

580
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,360
No matter who goes down.

581
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,360
Here!

582
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,240
Samuel!

583
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,000
- Samu!
- Samuel!

584
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,280
MISSING
SAMUEL GARCÍA DOMÍNGUEZ

585
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,360
Samuel!

586
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,880
Samu!

587
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,920
