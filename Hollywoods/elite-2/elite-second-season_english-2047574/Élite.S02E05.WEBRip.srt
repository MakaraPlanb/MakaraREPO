1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,880
<i>If anyone has seen him,
or has any information...</i>

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,360
63 HOURS MISSING

3
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,400
Giving interviews without consulting me
could jeopardize the investigation.

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,480
Really?

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,400
Great...

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,360
Of course I'll ask for help
wherever I need to.

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,960
Both of my sons have disappeared.
Both of them.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,680
And what do you people know about it?

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,320
What do you know?

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,120
Nothing at all.

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,160
- What are you doing here?
- I won't do anything.

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,000
- I'm going to smash your face in!
- Guzmán!

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,760
Guzmán, your sister was
the most important person in my life.

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,720
For real, we were going
to have a kid together!

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,640
I would've never hurt her! Ever!

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,520
- Shut up!
- I know it's easy to blame me,

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,800
but worry about your so-called friends.

18
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,200
- They are laughing at you.
- Shut up!

19
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,600
- Let's go, for fuck's sake! Move!
- Nano!

20
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,040
If you come anywhere
near me or them again, I'll kill you!

21
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,800
Do you always have to fuck everything up?

22
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,616
You're going to talk to me
like I'm criminal as well?

23
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,520
Don't come here
and start threatening everyone.

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,320
Go home and stay there.
Don't even stop off at the store.

25
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,376
You're still looking for evidence
to nail the little marchioness, right?

26
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,120
I'm doing things my own way.

27
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,456
And if you mess up again,
it will all go to shit.

28
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,160
- Don't fuck with me!
- No, you don't fuck with me!

29
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,800
You're going to do things my way, too.

30
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,720
Go home.

31
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,920
That thug walked right in here
as if he owned the place.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I know, and I'm sorry that it happened.

33
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,400
But it happened anyway.

34
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,280
Samuel...

35
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,480
Come in, please.

36
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,400
Let's hope you have the dog well tied up.

37
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,400
Lucrecia!

38
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,480
That person is innocent
until proven otherwise.

39
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,840
Or until he kills someone else.

40
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,160
Shouldn't there be a restraining order
against him?

41
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,800
God! He just came here
to tell you a few home truths.

42
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,416
You need to hear them every now and then.
He didn't slash anyone up.

43
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,240
The thugs look out for one other.
Why not give him a slap on the back?

44
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,840
You could do with a good slap.

45
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:18,320
Showing your vulgarity
doesn't make you right.

46
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,560
What did you say, blondie?
I didn't hear you well.

47
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,920
All right, that's enough!

48
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,480
Sit down.

49
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,080
May I?

50
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,200
How are you?

51
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,160
Not as happy as when I paid the bail.

52
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,240
I see...

53
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,400
Where did you get the money?

54
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,080
That's confidential information.

55
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,040
Are you scared?

56
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,520
Should I be?

57
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,560
No.

58
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,240
He won't set foot outside the house

59
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,160
and he won't cause any trouble. Trust me.

60
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,640
Does he know anything about you and me?

61
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,320
No, he has no idea about...

62
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,280
He doesn't know about you and me.

63
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,096
Hey, guys, you're all invited
to a party at Rebeca's!

64
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,040
Son of a bitch...

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,680
Does throwing a party right after
a murderer has threatened us all

66
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,880
seem normal to you?

67
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,080
You're going to stop living your life
because of that?

68
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,360
We are going to that party.

69
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,280
Baby...

70
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,240
Really? Do you want to go back
to your old house?

71
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,760
I don't know.
I think it's really creepy.

72
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,800
We are all going.
We'll have a great fucking time

73
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,640
and if Nano comes near anyone,
I'll smash his head open.

74
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,720
Did you think I was bluffing earlier?

75
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,000
Samuel told Carla
that Nano will be staying at home.

76
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,560
Sure, as if Samuel could stop Nano.

77
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,000
- He can't even...
- Nothing will happen, Ander.

78
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,040
Didn't you hear what Guzmán said?

79
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,896
Maybe the innocent guy will end up getting
killed because we got him released.

80
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,320
You're telling me?

81
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,560
I wasn't the one
that wanted to get him released!

82
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,640
No, you were happy to see him in jail
because of you.

83
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Shut up.

84
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,640
It has nothing to do with me.

85
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,720
The last thing I want
is to make them aware that I exist.

86
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,120
It was my mother attempting to get me
to make friends.

87
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,800
Look at that face.

88
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,320
That face... It's the same face every day.

89
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,440
Right, little brother?

90
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,040
That's what that shit does to you.

91
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,920
You're on a high one night
and then the comedown lasts for days.

92
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,480
Don't listen to her.

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,920
Come to my party and get right back on it.

94
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,360
I think it's ludicrous that your mom
sent us a text to invite us all

95
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,960
and that she misspelled "Halloween."

96
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,680
You're so right, babe. That's why I think
it's no place for you two Barbies.

97
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,160
What a pity. We've already confirmed.

98
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,000
Don't frown... Don't raise your eyebrow...

99
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,520
Or you'll get all wrinkled and need Botox.

100
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,736
It's a bit early for you to be acting like
a witch. The party hasn't started yet.

101
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,320
And you don't need to be acting
like a thug, all vulgar.

102
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,960
You won't make any friends like that.

103
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,840
Even if you threw parties every night.

104
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,120
- Listen to me, darling...
- Rebe, that's enough.

105
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,440
Saved by the bell.

106
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,800
Gosh...

107
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,040
Please, tell me you're coming.

108
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,480
I have to stay at the store.

109
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,560
No, please, girl...

110
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,680
You haven't told me
how the Viking-Arab fusion fuck went yet.

111
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,920
Sorry, Palestinian.

112
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,040
Nadia, please, my house will be crawling
with scumbags I can't stand.

113
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,680
I need a real friend.

114
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,040
How are you?

115
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,320
I've been better.

116
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,640
You left without saying a word.

117
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,840
Just so you know, I put myself
in your shoes and I understand you.

118
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,160
But...

119
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,360
But I don't know...

120
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,760
I don't think your suffering will end

121
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,800
if you always go about things
with your fists.

122
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,880
Very good. Thanks for the advice.

123
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,040
Don't you have anything to say to me
apart from that?

124
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,360
- This is neither the time nor...
- Yes, it is the time.

125
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,120
Please.

126
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,000
I think it would be best
if we went our separate ways.

127
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,720
- You with your girlfriend and I...
- What if I left Lu?

128
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,240
What would you do?

129
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,240
- Don't talk nonsense.
- Shit...

130
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,160
- Why is no one taking me seriously...
- Darling?

131
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,440
- Hi!
- Lu, please. I'm busy.

132
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,920
Excuse me for interrupting
your friendly chat.

133
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,160
We need to talk about Christian stuff.
Your ears may start burning

134
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,840
so I'm stealing him from you for a while.
Follow me, love.

135
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,880
No, no! Be careful! Ander!

136
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,320
It's wet, I just cleaned it. Shit, man.

137
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,160
Why did you do it?

138
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,440
The cleaning lady was here two days ago.

139
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,880
- I have nothing else to do.
- How about passing the baccalaureate?

140
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,480
It's hard for both of us.

141
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,120
And apart from that?
What am I doing here?

142
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,520
Eating your food, invading your space...
I don't know. I don't feel comfortable.

143
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,080
Why?

144
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,200
Because you aren't either.
I'm a nuisance to you.

145
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,880
Nonsense.

146
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,400
Maybe I abandoned you a bit.

147
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,560
Maybe, he says...

148
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,160
Listen, let's do something.

149
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,280
Tomorrow Rebeca's having a party at hers.

150
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,560
We should go, get tipsy...
I need it as well.

151
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,200
Come home
and fool around in bed until dinner time.

152
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
How does that sound?

153
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,080
I've never been out for Halloween.

154
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,480
- Really?
- Well...

155
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,240
At my house, it's the devil's work.

156
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,320
That's a yes, then.

157
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,640
That's "I'll check my agenda."

158
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,840
What's that face for?

159
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,880
Shit, man...

160
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,520
Mom is being weird around me
and you won't let me out to get some air.

161
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,800
It's for the good of everyone.

162
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,280
I don't want to make trouble, Samu.

163
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,720
I just want to live in peace.

164
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,040
You know that I can't be
cooped up inside, but I...

165
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,160
I trust you and I'll do as you say.
I won't go anywhere.

166
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,720
I'd love for you to trust me, too.

167
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,240
All right.

168
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,440
All right.

169
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,480
My bail.

170
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,280
Nobody leaves that kind of dough
in the mailbox as if it were flyers.

171
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,456
- Where did you get so much money?
- I know how to make a living.

172
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,480
Samu...

173
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,440
- I'm doing a delivery job.
- Delivery of what?

174
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,360
- I don't ask.
- Who don't you ask?

175
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,440
It's not your business.

176
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,680
I didn't ask questions
when I started either and look at me now.

177
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,160
Anyway,

178
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,520
now that I'm out, you can leave it,
whatever it is, okay?

179
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,400
Easy money is more addictive than heroin.

180
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,120
So you are going to leave it.

181
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,560
<i>We were halfway through the conversation.</i>

182
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,560
<i>How about we finish it
at your friend's party?</i>

183
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,840
<i>I knew you'd say no at first.</i>

184
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,880
<i>Think about it, okay?</i>

185
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,600
Hey. How are you?

186
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,720
I guess people are still going
to the trashy girl's party, right?

187
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,040
- You heard what Guzmán said.
- Yeah, right.

188
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,400
I think I have the perfect costume.

189
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,000
Jackie O.

190
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,120
O. Onassis.

191
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,560
Well, when she was still Jackie Kennedy.

192
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,880
I actually want to wear that epic dress
she had on when her husband was killed.

193
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,560
I'm just not sure whether to go
for before or after the shooting.

194
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,320
I guess after, to make it look darker...

195
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,000
It would be cool
if I had a JFK to accompany me.

196
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,640
A Kennedy.

197
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,320
You want us to get dressed up as a couple?

198
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,760
Okay.

199
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,600
- Okay.
- Sure.

200
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,280
- Sure?
- Yes, why not?

201
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,280
- Great!
- Yeah.

202
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,840
How shall we do it?

203
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,240
- We're all going together.
- Okay.

204
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,800
That's what people were saying
in the WhatsApp group.

205
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,120
I'm not in the group.

206
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200
I see...

207
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,280
Well...

208
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,840
You are now.

209
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,360
Polo added you to the group

210
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,440
I am now.

211
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,440
Thank you very much.
Okay, that's the plan, then.

212
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,096
- That's the plan.
- This is so exciting!

213
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,480
- Bye.
- Bye.

214
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,840
Val!

215
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,160
Dad wants to see you.

216
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,536
I talked to him and he agreed
not to ground you anymore.

217
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,720
Okay, that's great.

218
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,920
- Where is he? The kitchen?
- Yes.

219
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,880
You love doing that, don't you?

220
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,520
Did he really agree?

221
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,280
- Are you underestimating me?
- Never.

222
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,200
You're amazing.

223
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,920
I thought I was a hypocrite,
like the rest of the family.

224
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,040
You are a little bit.

225
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,120
For denying yourself
something that makes you happy.

226
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,080
Guzmán makes me happy.

227
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,240
He is distant

228
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,880
and you're in denial.

229
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,320
That's a great combo.

230
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,720
That's how couples work.
They have their ups and downs.

231
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,480
But you can't understand it.
You've never been in one.

232
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,840
- This is the usual.
- The usual?

233
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,280
Who wants that?

234
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,280
"Never love anyone
who treats you like you're ordinary."

235
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,280
Oscar Wilde.

236
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,000
I gave you that book.

237
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,440
- I'll read it to you any time.
- No.

238
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,640
I've already read it.

239
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,120
- Lazy bastard.
- I was in my underwear.

240
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,360
If you'd warned me earlier...

241
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,640
What do you want?

242
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,480
- I brought your stuff.
- My stuff?

243
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,560
Here, biker, count it.
I don't want any trouble later.

244
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,720
- What's this?
- The delivery money.

245
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,960
- What about the envelope in my mailbox?
- What envelope?

246
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,816
What are you on about? We pay in person.
Discretion and transparency, kid.

247
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,520
I paid my brother's bail with the money
they left me in the mailbox.

248
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,320
Samu, my mother pays you well for riding
around on your bike, but not that well.

249
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,600
What? Do you know who did it?

250
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,600
Are you fucking kidding me?

251
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,280
The marchioness?

252
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
No...

253
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,360
Well, I don't know.

254
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,640
See you later.

255
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,560
<i>You have assumed</i>

256
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,440
that Samuel has disappeared

257
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,000
and Nano ran away.

258
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,920
But I don't think that's the case.

259
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,560
Why?

260
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,960
Samuel told me
that Nano had lots of plans.

261
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,136
I don't think that Nano
would leave of his own accord.

262
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,320
Then, what do you think
could have happened?

263
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,120
Nano must have run away.

264
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,920
That's what murderers do.
They kill and they go on the run.

265
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,120
Don't you think it could be related
to Samuel's disappearance?

266
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,480
Not even after witnessing what happened?

267
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,520
Put that arm back up.

268
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,360
Like that.

269
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,680
Don't be an idiot.

270
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,440
Hello, everyone.

271
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,560
Baby...

272
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,480
You're going to wear a tracksuit
for the party?

273
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,800
It's from a movie. What's wrong with it?

274
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
What's that?

275
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,960
Man...

276
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm Doctor Frank-N-Furter.

277
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,176
Haven't you seen <i>Rocky Horror?</i>

278
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,480
I've seen <i>Rocky V.</i>

279
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,416
Frida Kahlo, maybe. But nobody will know
that I'm supposed to be Diego Rivera.

280
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,320
- What?
- I look like a cowboy.

281
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,720
No, you don't. Listen, Guzmán.

282
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,920
Love, Frida and Diego
were together all the time.

283
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,240
That's why we have
to go to the party as them.

284
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,079
Let me tell you something.

285
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,720
I'm sure Samuel prefers elegant
young ladies over ones that wear trackies.

286
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,560
And why would I care what Samuel likes?

287
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,640
You wouldn't care at all, kid.

288
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,079
Leave that and tell the decorators
what you want in your basement.

289
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,616
And what a state you left it in, girl!

290
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,320
Thank goodness the new cleaners
turned out to be efficient.

291
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,800
Guzmán...

292
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,760
I love you.

293
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,320
Look...

294
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,800
I know, no sentimentalities...

295
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,400
- No, it's not that.
- Yes, it is.

296
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,000
I know we don't usually say
that kind of stuff...

297
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,520
But it's okay to remind you
every once in a while.

298
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,600
Look how good we look together.

299
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,840
What's this?

300
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,440
Your costume.

301
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,320
You must be kidding.

302
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,400
It's what Rocky Horror wears.

303
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,400
Shit, I have to practice walking
in these heels.

304
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:39,000
The creature that I, the Doctor,
am creating in my lab to alleviate my...

305
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,600
- You have to see the film.
- No.

306
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,960
Let's go to the Chinese store
and get a few masks or something.

307
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Why?

308
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,720
I'm not going in a gold thong.

309
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,560
It's not a thong.

310
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,120
- I'm not going to show up there and...
- And what?

311
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,240
It's just one night to have a good time
and dress up together. That's all.

312
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,560
I have never dressed up before.
By choice, I mean.

313
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,560
Because I have to disguise myself
all year round.

314
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,160
You look so tall.

315
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,440
Mom says you spend a lot of time together
with the girl throwing the party.

316
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,280
Is something going on with her?

317
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,280
Like what?

318
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,056
As in, do you play PlayStation together.
Shit, man...

319
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,160
- Sometimes we play PlayStation.
- Really?

320
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,760
But we mostly box.

321
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,040
You box?

322
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,560
I haven't seen that as a way to hook up,
not even in prison...

323
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,160
We're just friends.

324
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,600
Friends and business partners?

325
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,000
- She has something to do with...
- No.

326
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,640
And stay out of my business.

327
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,760
- I'm worried about you.
- It's a bit late for that.

328
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,536
I don't want you getting into trouble
because of a girl.

329
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,320
- Relax. I'm not like you.
- I hope not.

330
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,520
You know what?

331
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,200
None of it was Marina's fault.

332
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,040
Maybe you're right about me
always fucking things up for everyone.

333
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,160
I'm really sorry, Samu.

334
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,840
She lives at her old house.

335
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,080
In Marina's house.

336
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,721
Going there was really fucked up at first,
but it hurts less and less.

337
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,120
That's enough. Done.

338
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,320
Dressed to kill.

339
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,800
Have a good time.

340
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,160
<i>Again...</i>

341
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,280
I've already told you, ma'am.

342
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,840
A lot of people wanted to get rid of Nano.

343
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,360
Guzmán...

344
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,560
The marchioness...

345
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,320
And what can you tell me about
what happened at your Halloween party?

346
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,160
- That's cool, man.
- Yes.

347
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,440
Mrs. Kennedy?

348
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,480
How cool.

349
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,960
You all right?

350
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,360
Yes. And you? Are you all right?

351
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,960
- Yes, everything's good.
- Okay.

352
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,560
Come right now. Our costumes go together.

353
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,440
Doesn't coming back to this house
freak you out?

354
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,680
Okay, guys, drinks,
ice and food over there.

355
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,600
Coats, condoms and vices over here.

356
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,520
You look cute.

357
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,680
Same as you.

358
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,240
I'm fascinated by your den.

359
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,280
I can't tell the difference
between the Halloween decorations

360
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,160
and the ones you have up
the rest of the year.

361
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,520
Yes, it's fucking fantastic.

362
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,960
I'm sorry it's not all spick-and-span.

363
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,960
The cleaners didn't really
scrub it properly.

364
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,960
Should we go get a drink, darling?
I need one.

365
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,840
- Look at you!
- Girl, this party rocks.

366
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,816
How did you let yourself end up like this?

367
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,120
He looks so handsome!

368
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,640
Are you sure you're totally gay?

369
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,840
- Let's take a photo.
- Stop fucking around with me.

370
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,000
I sure would like to, babe.

371
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,400
Come on, smile!

372
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,960
Smile, man!

373
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,216
Dad, do you think
we will finish very late tonight?

374
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,240
Same as always.

375
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:20,160
REBECA
Nadia, come here! Check out your brother!

376
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,920
I deny the devil, I embrace God.

377
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,120
Dad, what's going on?

378
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,200
It's okay. Don't worry.

379
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,280
I'm happy.

380
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,440
I'm at peace.

381
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,360
Thank you for making me so proud.

382
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,800
Look how you have taken care
of everything.

383
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,720
Of the store...

384
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,880
Of us...

385
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,600
Of your studies...

386
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,720
You are the gift that life
has given us to overcome...

387
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,240
all this pain and disappointment.

388
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,960
You've poured out the whole bottle.

389
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,696
I'm not saying you look bad.
I just said it's not you.

390
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,256
Because I'm dressed up all feminine.
Right, that's cleared things up for me.

391
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,400
- You can go fuck yourself.
- That's not what I meant.

392
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,720
If being so feminine freaks you out,
take a look at your friend.

393
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,120
Fucking hell...

394
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,296
Which drag queen are you meant to be?
From that RuPaul show, right?

395
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,160
No, it's from the <i>Rocky Horror Show.</i>

396
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,720
A bit too much horror.

397
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,240
I like it.

398
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,680
Shit. This is even better
than what I heard.

399
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,360
Do you know what we're dressed up as?
Isn't it cool?

400
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,960
No, I don't. And no, it definitely isn't.

401
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,920
I'm putting my coat on.

402
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,120
What? Ander!

403
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,480
Fucking hell...

404
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,680
Come on, let's change the music.
This is fucking boring. Move, David Bowie.

405
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,760
Thanks.

406
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,160
We need to get plastered
to get everyone dancing properly.

407
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,480
So we're going to play
a game of "Never Have I Ever."

408
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,040
Come on! Really?
How old are we, exactly? Ten?

409
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,200
You're going to have a hell of a time,
babe, believe me.

410
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,440
You all know how to play?

411
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,520
One person says what they have never done
and anyone who has done it has to drink.

412
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,880
We're going to get well wasted, then.

413
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,600
I'm sure we've done it all.

414
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,000
You tell me, baby.

415
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,080
Even better, baby, that way
we'll get to know each other faster.

416
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,080
I'll go first.

417
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,080
Never have I ever been poor.

418
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,960
And since I have, I have to drink.

419
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,480
I have another question.
I think some of you are not being honest.

420
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,600
Never have I ever...

421
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,680
cleaned someone else's house.

422
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,760
Boring! I have a better one.

423
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,200
Never have I ever slept
with my best friend's boyfriend.

424
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,520
What a bitch...

425
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,320
Anyone else?

426
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,040
Where were you? And your costume?

427
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,160
Can we talk?

428
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,680
Yes.

429
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,640
You're a son of a bitch.

430
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,560
You came here to dump me, right now?

431
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,881
- You couldn't wait till...
- I wasn't going to break up on the phone!

432
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,936
- I wasn't going to break up on the phone!
- On the phone?

433
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,520
I've been trying to talk to you
all week long.

434
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,816
- Me, too...
- You won't let me speak!

435
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,360
- You won't let me say what I want to say!
- No, wait, listen to me.

436
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,520
I just told you to wait for one more hour.

437
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,120
- This has nothing to do with that!
- Then why? Because I said I love you?

438
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,376
- No, Lu.
- I was being honest!

439
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,720
I don't love you!

440
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,920
I don't love you.

441
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,600
I don't love you.

442
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,640
Shit.

443
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,880
Let's go home.

444
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,360
Let's go home.
I don't want to be here any...

445
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,880
I slept with Nadia.

446
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,800
You can't be serious.

447
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,440
You can't be serious, obviously.

448
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,640
I know you really well.
You just want to screw me up.

449
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,080
Am I wrong? Look at me.

450
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,360
- Lu, listen to me, please.
- No!

451
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,200
- Not like this.
- Not like what?

452
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,280
You saved my life.

453
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,120
I swear I will always be grateful...

454
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,560
Go to hell.

455
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:32,160
Never have I ever passed myself off
for someone else, ever in my life.

456
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,360
Enough! This is getting
a little bit boring, right?

457
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,800
Can you come with me for a second?

458
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,200
Caye, do you want to tell me something?

459
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,280
Say it here.

460
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,800
Or don't you want the others to hear?

461
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,880
I'm leaving. This party sucks.

462
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,560
Don't be a fool! Come back here!
This game is tons of fun!

463
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,640
Here, Bowie.

464
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,080
So many people!

465
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,240
And you look so elegant, babe!

466
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,600
You're sure to get laid tonight. Come on.

467
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,520
Introduce me to your friends.
The gorgeous ones first.

468
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,640
- Hello, kid.
- Hello.

469
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,000
What's your name?

470
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,280
I'm leaving.

471
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,920
You look... You look so familiar.

472
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,240
Isn't she the...

473
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,680
Come on, Mom, go back upstairs.
You're cramping our style.

474
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,680
Okay, okay.

475
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,440
Come on, let's play some good music now.

476
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
The cleaning lady at school
is your mom, right?

477
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,240
Only a mother gets treated so badly.

478
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,040
You had me in firing range.
Why didn't you finish me off?

479
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,920
Because under all this
there's a decent person.

480
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,920
What a story you've made up. Why?
To make yourself think you're one of them?

481
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,480
- I feel sorry for you.
- I'm not pretending.

482
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,320
This is how I want to be.

483
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:05,080
You are who you are when you're alone.
And you, on your own, you mop floors.

484
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,520
But you're so far up your own ass
that you look down on me.

485
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,040
On my own.

486
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,680
I was just a little girl
that believed in fairy tales.

487
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,440
And since my fairy godmother
never appeared

488
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,280
to turn me into a princess,
I had to do it myself.

489
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,120
I can tell I wasn't the only one.

490
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,560
But, then again, you did win the lottery.

491
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,560
So, everything okay?

492
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,560
At least I'm not dressed as a stripper.

493
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,920
It was Omar's idea.

494
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,160
Suddenly he went camp
and turned into a drag queen.

495
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,520
What an eyesore. Seriously.

496
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,400
Omar! Omar!

497
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,920
- Are you leaving?
- Yes.

498
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,640
Ander?

499
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,200
Don't even think
about leaving because of him.

500
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,840
I won't allow it.

501
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,760
Come.

502
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,760
He doesn't deserve you.

503
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,480
So what do I do?

504
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,560
Everything about me annoys him.

505
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,320
"Never love anyone
who treats you like you're ordinary."

506
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,360
Oscar Wilde.

507
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,760
Stay and have a few shots with me.
We need it.

508
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,040
Guzmán?

509
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,320
Want to dance?

510
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,560
Nobody looks as divine as we do.

511
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,280
Frida, you're missing the unibrow.

512
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,320
In hell, we have laser hair removal.

513
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,800
Can you talk to the guys at the club?

514
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,760
But are you sure you want to work there?

515
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,920
If I were you, I'd think about it.

516
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,400
They'll make you a servant and
you'll have to put up with a lot of shit.

517
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,320
Val...

518
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,800
I don't care. I need the money
in order to leave Ander's place.

519
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,440
Before he kicks me out.

520
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,080
I'll think about it.

521
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,480
On one condition.

522
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:28,719
What?

523
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,239
Follow me...

524
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,400
and you'll find out.

525
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,760
Thank you.

526
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,000
What are you dressed up as?

527
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,440
Tonight we are Frida and Lioncourt.

528
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,080
I thought you were the guy
from Guns N' Roses.

529
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,159
No.

530
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,760
I'm the Lord of Lioncourt,

531
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,600
who rose from the dead centuries ago
as a vampire,

532
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,680
to drag my grief and my pain through time
until becoming...

533
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,680
this decadent...

534
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,640
rock star.

535
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,760
Hello.

536
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,320
How are you doing? Fine?

537
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,000
You invited
the wrong dead man tonight, my dear.

538
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,960
That ass is right, damn it.

539
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,360
Look at Michael Myers.

540
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,320
Let me see that machete.

541
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,120
What's up, Rebeca?

542
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,440
Not much, as you can see.

543
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,256
I can't be here for long
so I'll get straight to the point.

544
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,440
Leave my brother alone.

545
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,760
What?

546
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,440
Break it off with him.

547
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:08,920
Nothing is going on between us
because he doesn't want it.

548
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,280
I want him to stop working for you.

549
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,240
What is your problem, Nano?

550
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,400
Is it because he's earning more than
he ever would delivering spring rolls?

551
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,320
- I'm not a fool.
- You are not.

552
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,720
- I know how this works.
- How?

553
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,160
When something goes wrong, the first one
to fall is the pawn and not the queen.

554
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,280
Listen to me, man.

555
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,856
I'm the only chick in the world

556
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,720
that would go for the idiot brother
over the wild child.

557
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,080
And to top it off, I'm all dressed up
like a princess and he's laughing at me.

558
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,560
To me, your brother is no pawn.

559
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,800
Just so you know.

560
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,200
I would never let anything happen to him.

561
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,200
So don't tell me all your shit

562
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,160
and whatever you have to say to him,
say it directly, champ.

563
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,880
Fucking hell.

564
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,840
Aren't you a little short for a slasher?

565
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,856
I thought you were avoiding me
since that whole thing with your brother.

566
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,000
Can we talk?

567
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,440
Did you leave me the money
to pay my brother's bail in the letterbox?

568
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,200
Come.

569
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,120
It wasn't you.

570
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,160
What does it matter who paid?

571
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,960
The important thing is that Nano is out.

572
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,920
What?

573
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,560
It wasn't you.

574
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,000
It's not like you.

575
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,560
To help you? Oh, thanks a lot.

576
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,000
It wasn't your style.

577
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,080
A wad of cash inside a garbage bag
posted through my mailbox...

578
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,000
Marchionesses use garbage bags, too,
you know? We even recycle.

579
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,480
The money was in an envelope,

580
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,000
not a bag.

581
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,200
It wasn't you.

582
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,000
Listen, just so you know.

583
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,520
Some of us give orders
and others execute them.

584
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,280
Like, for example, I order you to kiss me,
and what do you do?

585
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,320
You make me so horny
when you get all macho man.

586
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,456
You only kiss me
when you want me on a tight leash

587
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,000
or when you feel backed into a corner.

588
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,600
See you in class.

589
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,320
Nadia.

590
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,680
What are you doing here?

591
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,760
I need to talk to you.

592
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,120
I'm sorry, I can't. I don't have time.

593
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,480
I broke up with Lu.

594
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,640
You thought I never would.

595
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,520
Neither did I.

596
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,640
But I did it
because I want to be with you.

597
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,960
Nadia...

598
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,840
Nadia.

599
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,240
You know that's impossible.

600
00:40:54,680 --> 00:41:00,280
Listen. If it's because of your family,
we'll talk to them. We'll sort it all out.

601
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,400
I'm sorry, I can't.

602
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,280
Nadia, please...

603
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,440
Lu can survive having her heart
broken by you, but my family cannot.

604
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,080
Please...

605
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,560
CAYETANA
SAMUEL'S BROTHER IS AT THE PARTY!!!

606
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,680
Fucking son of a bitch...

607
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,720
Grab Nano. I'm on my way.

608
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,320
<i>I'm going to smash his head open!
Don't let him get away, okay?</i>

609
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,040
<i>Don't let him get away!</i>

610
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,440
What the fuck do we do?

611
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,080
We have to find him before he does.

612
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,800
What if things get nasty?

613
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,280
- We shouldn't have come to this.
- We shouldn't have let him out!

614
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,440
No! I should have talked to Guzmán.

615
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,960
Maybe that's what needs to be done.

616
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,000
Guzmán should be told that it wasn't Nano.

617
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,880
And what if he asks you how you know?

618
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,000
Stop acting like a dickhead.

619
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,880
That's what I should have done
to begin with.

620
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,520
Let go of me!

621
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,736
I thought you were my friend.

622
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,080
You're capable of letting
an innocent man pay to save your own ass!

623
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,800
Or you'd let him get killed!

624
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,000
Another death on your head
wouldn't make much difference, would it?

625
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:02,960
And then you wonder why you're all alone.
You're the one that should be in prison!

626
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,120
Fucking monster!

627
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,120
Polo...

628
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,320
- Get away from me.
- Come on, let's go.

629
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,800
Get away from me, Ander!

630
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,800
This is my house and I'll decide
how you gotta shake your booty.

631
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,000
You're leaving already?

632
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,160
With blondie, right?

633
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,360
No, I'm going home.

634
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,040
With your brother.

635
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,040
Haven't you seen him?
He was looking for you.

636
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,640
Nano, answer the fucking phone.
Where the fuck are you?

637
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,600
Shit!

638
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,040
Here you are. Did you see my text?

639
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,320
Nano is here.

640
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,960
Are you okay?

641
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,760
Polo?

642
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,360
Get away from me, please.

643
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,440
Why?

644
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,960
Because I'm not who I seem to be.

645
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,160
No one is.

646
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,160
Okay.

647
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,680
Where the fuck are you, Nano?
Fucking hell!

648
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,840
Shit!

649
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,800
Sorry.

650
00:45:58,880 --> 00:45:59,920
Samuel!

651
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:09,320
Your Cabify will arrive in three minutes

652
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,440
What do you want to do to Samu?

653
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,936
You put Marina in her grave
and turned Christian into a vegetable.

654
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,800
What the fuck is wrong with you?

655
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,360
I've already killed a posh girl.

656
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,280
- What if I killed another one?
- Let go of her!

657
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,520
So, that's how you were investigating her?
She's laughing at you.

658
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,640
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

659
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,040
Samuel, please, stop.

660
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,240
He did it.

661
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,376
Samuel, you're going to kill him!

662
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,240
It kills me to say it.

663
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,880
Always fucking my life up!

664
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,240
But he did it.

665
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,360
Yes.

666
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,560
He almost beat him to death.

667
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,520
I think he made Nano disappear.

668
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,000
It wouldn't surprise me.

669
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,600
In the end, the one you'd least expect...

670
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,160
turns out to be the worst of the monsters.
