I'm actually surprised,

174
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,958
So, Officer Denny here will take
the rest of your statement, all right?

175
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,502
It's not what people do at a crime scene.

176
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,086
Thank you.

177
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,922
I do not wanna see you again!

178
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:33,673
[chuckles] Hi.

179
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,385
- Hi. Hey. Who were you talking to?
- [sighs]

180
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:40,014
Oh, just, uh, someone
in dire need of wardrobe advice.

181
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,516
I mean, socks with sandals.
Need I say more?

182
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:44,602
Lucifer, who is that?

183
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,480
It's, um...

184
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,192
[sighs] It's my dad.

185
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,236
Your dad? As in, God?

186
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,198
Yes. Yes, and I know
it's probably very overwhelming,

187
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,742
but please
do not inflate his ego, Detective.

188
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,078
It's big enough as it is.
Here we go again.

189
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,162
Hi.

190
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:06,749
[chuckles] Hi, God, I... Well... I'm Chloe.

191
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:11,087
I'm guessing you already know that,
but here's something maybe you don't know,

192
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,297
and respectfully, sir,

193
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,883
you are a terrible father.

194
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,680
I am sure you had your hands full with
creating the Earth, you know, the sun,

195
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,139
the universe, whatever,

196
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,725
but I know what it's like
to be a working parent,

197
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:28,312
and my two cents, again,
respectfully, when it comes to Lucifer.

198
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,814
you screwed up.

199
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:30,897
Big time.

200
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:34,694
You know, your kid acts up,
and you kick them out of the house

201
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,904
and go radio silent
for thousands of years?

202
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,155
That's just mean.

203
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,699
Respectfully.

204
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,213
It's nice to finally
meet you, Chloe Decker.

205
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,175
I can certainly see
how much you care for my son.

206
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,804
- He's lucky to have you.
- Right, 'cause I'm a gift?

207
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,223
Speaking of, I'd like to talk...

208
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,600
That's probably enough
for our first meet and greet.

209
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,520
We don't want anyone to get smited. Yes.

210
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,230
Plus, we have a murder to solve.

211
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:14,358
So off you pop, Dad. Come on.

212
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,988
Now you see what I've been dealing with?

213
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,071
Yeah.

214
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,659
- [grunts]
- [Charlie cooing]

215
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,537
[Linda] What are you doing?

216
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,497
Oh, I, uh...

217
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,208
I spoke to my father.

218
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,920
Turns out
we won't be needing this after all.

219
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,757
Well, do wings come in later?

220
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,509
Or is it, like,
a puberty thing? [chuckling]

221
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:44,555
Am I gonna find feathers next to
crusty socks under his bed? [laughs]

222
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,643
Charlie won't be
getting wings, Linda, ever.

223
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,647
I'm sorry to say that our son is just a...

224
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,441
just a normal human baby.

225
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,234
Well, that's a relief!

226
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,445
Why do you look so sad?

227
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:02,490
Do you not realize that this is good news?

228
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,366
No more ugly-ass bubble wrap.

229
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,827
No more worrying
about a head-on with a 737.

230
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:10,664
I mean, this... This... This is fantastic.

231
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,208
Because he can't fly.

232
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,376
Yay.

233
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,381
Okay, wait.

234
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:23,093
You're disappointed because
you think angels are better than humans.

235
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,637
Don't you?

236
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,806
Well, yes, Linda. We <i>are</i> better.

237
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,308
We can fly. We live forever.

238
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,185
There's our superhuman strength.

239
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:44,323
I... probably shouldn't have done that.

240
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,575
[metal creaking]

241
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,997
I'll have Maze take a look at that.

242
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,458
Did I mention that we can fly?

243
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:59,004
[clears throat] I mean,
no offense, Linda, but we <i>are</i> better.

244
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:04,385
Okay. Um, offense taken, Amenadiel.

245
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,469
You know what?

246
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:10,307
Why don't you
fly this bag of shit to the trash

247
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,686
while Charlie and I
go on a lame human walk?

248
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:18,774
"You ruined my life, and I'm gonna make
sure you never ref another game again.

249
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,861
The world would be a better place
if you would just drop dead."

250
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:22,944
Subtle.

251
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,281
This email came from your account, JJ.

252
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,364
So?

253
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,994
So it sounds like your son threatened
to kill the referee who is now dead.

254
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,871
Surely, you see
where we're going with this.

255
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,665
So you're a linebacker
for the Mulholland High Saints?

256
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,544
And until last week's
playoff loss to the Wildcats,

257
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:41,130
you had a full scholarship
to SMU on the table?

258
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,798
You mean until the ref made

259
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,468
the most asinine call in
the history of high school football? Yes.

260
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:51,432
So you blame Steve Rockwell
for the loss of your scholarship?

261
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:55,853
Of course it's Rockwell's fault.
He's a stupid ref who made a stupid call.

262
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,897
He ruined everything for us.

263
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,733
Don't you mean ruined
everything for <i>him?</i> [chuckles]

264
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,611
JJ, do you even want to be an LB at SMU?

265
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,780
I mean, it's a lot of acronyms
to keep track of, for starters.

266
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,784
He doesn't know what he wants. He's 17.

267
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,203
That's why I'm here,
helping him, guiding him.

268
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,413
Watching him.

269

Tell me, what is it you truly desire?

311
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,063
I... I...

312
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,900
I wanna be in the CIA.

313
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,905
- Oh, did not see that coming.
- Mm.

314
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,740
The Culinary Institute of America.

315
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,743
I wanna be a pastry chef.

316
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,244
The CI what now?

317
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,789
[pounds table] Madam, please!
Ground your helicopter.

318
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:05,459
It's time you let this poor boy
make his own decisions, and...

319
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,545
I... I need a word with my father.

320
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,215
[door closes]

321
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,513
Okay, if you must know, I sent that email.

322
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,265
- [Chloe] Hmm.
- But you can't hold me.

323
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,769
You don't have any evidence that
I killed anyone. You wanna know why?

324
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,854
Because I didn't. JJ, let's go.

325
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,649
Um... I'd like to say something.

326
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,484
- Just...
- [Chloe] Excuse me.

327
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,069
Go ahead.

328
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:36,073
I saw Mr. Rockwell arguing with some dude
in the parking lot a couple of days ago.

329
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:36,990
Mm-hmm.

330
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,284
I didn't recognize the guy,
but it looked intense.

331
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,368
Can you describe him?

332
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:44,331
Not really. Uh, tall,
he was wearing, like, a ball cap.

333
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,502
No, but he got into, like,
this really old-school yellow truck.

334
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:49,920
Does that help?

335
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,756
Yes. Yes, it does, thank you, JJ.

336
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,137
Maybe you should join the CIA.

337
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,015
- You're a really good spy.
- You really should start listening to him.

338
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,099
What now?

339
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:08,605
- Are you okay?
- [sighing]

340
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:13,110
- You thought your Dad was here?
- He was, but he seems to have vanished.

341
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:17,072
[sighs] Well, at least
JJ's mom is clearly guilty as sin.

342
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:22,744
We... not exactly. No confession,
no hard evidence. We can't hold her.

343
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,247
My gut says that
she's innocent anyhow, so...

344
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:30,377
Even if she didn't kill the ref,
that woman is far from innocent.

345
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,213
Poor JJ is permanently screwed,

346
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:37,384
destined to be a broken man because
of his overbearing, judgmental mother.

347
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:40,387
He will never be able
to live like a normal person,

348
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,514
love like a normal person.

349
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,932
- [sighs]
- Yeah.

350
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,227
I feel... for him.

351
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,813
Best thing for JJ is
to sever all ties with the tyrant,

352
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,607
get as far away from her as possible.

353
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:56,695
Or maybe he could keep his parent close

354
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,281
so that they could
work through their issues.

355
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,993
Rebuild their broken relationship

356
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:05,829
so that he might let go
of his anger and resentment and...

357
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,499
live a normal life.

358
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,669
And have normal,
loving relationships. Yeah.

359
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,176
Huh. [exhales]

360
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:23,513
So, I'd give you the tour,
but I know you've been spying... I mean,

361
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,891
kindly watching over me for millennia.

362
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,560
Uh, the bed's yours. I'll take the sofa.

363
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,145
Clean towels in the bathroom.

364
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:34,149
But for you's sake, don't use my loofah.
That's gross. I got you your own.

365
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,110
What exactly is this about, son?

366
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:41,573
Well, remember that thing
that I said about staying away

367
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,533
- from me for all eternity?
- Mm-hmm.

368
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,410
I take it back.

369
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:49,414
I think it's time that
you and I <i>worked</i> on our relationship

370
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,292
so that I may <i>have</i> a relationship.

371
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,376
Ergo...

372
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:57,881
<i>mi casa es su casa,</i> Dad.

373
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,925
- Hmm.
- Fun.

374
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,008
Yeah.

375
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,724
Interrogation's through those doors.

376
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,060
Lots of judging goes on in there.
You'd like that.

377
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:14,273
Uh, donuts are here, a triumph of mankind,
as I'm sure you're aware. Here.

378
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,316
[laughs] Have a sprinkled.

379
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,568
- My favorite.
- Mm-hmm.

380
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,487
Very nice.

381
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,573
I prefer the ones
with the little cereal bits on top.

382
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:24,491
But thank you.

383
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:27,953
Anyway, that's pretty much it.

384
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,247
So where's your throne?

385
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,957
[laughs]

386
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,626
There are no thrones here, Dad.
That's not how it works.

387
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,837
Right. Right, I... I knew that.

388
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,549
I meant metaphorically,
where's your seat of power?

389
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,176
- You said you were very important here.
- I am.

390
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,763
But I, you know,
prefer to stand, ready for action.

391
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:47,847
[God] Hmm.

392
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,642

- So you don't have an office?

393
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,562
- It's open floor plan, Dad!
- [mumbles] Oh, okay.

394
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,605
- So where's your desk?
- [sighs]

395
00:21:55,689 --> 00:22:00,193
Oh, Daniel, would you mind
explaining to this gentleman

396
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,696
how important I am
to the investigative process?

397
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,489
Not now, Lucifer.

398
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,407
He has a desk.

399
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,159
Maybe if you work hard enough,

400
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:10,370
you might one day
rise to this man's level.

401
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,957
- Or you can maybe get one of these.
- [Lucifer] Hmm.

00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,001
Uh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,797
Uh, Dan, this is...

00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,090

- [God] Hmm.

00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,094
You know, the big man.

It's, uh... It's real nice, buddy.

Oh.

418
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,584
I know who you are, actually.

[Dan] Hmm.

00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:00,504
I believe you met my wife.

Oh. Hmm.

00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,846
- Right.
- [Dan chuckles]

423
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,522
I'll be seeing you later.

424
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:21,607
Or not.

00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:25,904
Anyway, Dad, why don't I show you

- Lunchtime.
- [Ella] What? Don't... How dare you!

00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,002

432
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:44,464
Well, he's got a motorcycle.

[hesitates] Yeah, well,
motorcycles are unsafe.

But I think it's just an act.

Oh. Hi. Hey.

Uh, did you, uh, find a yellow truck?

492
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:32,132
Uh, not yet, but, um, you okay?

493
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:35,093
Oh, yeah, I just got
a couple of reports back from the lab.

494
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,720
You know how excited I get.

First, identified the poison.

You gotta order them through hospitals,

Right, so not exactly a lead,
but could help narrow things later.

No, <i>here</i> is the juicy one.

Other than the victim's,

500

we found two other people's
fingerprints on Rockwell's whistle.

- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

- So, anything from AFIS?
<i>- </i>Nope. But I did get a hit on EDS.

00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,580

00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:15,467
So, uh, Dale McVey,
the coach for Benedict Canyon Wildcats.

509
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:19,095

hurt Rockwell, because his bad call

00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,305
made the Wildcats win.

511
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,388
Right, but...

512
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:24,684
[Lucifer] Dad! What are you doing?
You're embarrassing me.

513
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,811
[God] I didn't say
there was anything wrong with it.

514
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,814
It's not what you're saying, Dad.
It's the way that you're saying it.

515
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,275
- Hey, Lucifer.
- Hi.

516
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,235
And hello again to you, sir.

517
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,863
Good to see you two hanging out.

518
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,717
- He doesn't like the coffee.
- I didn't say that. I didn't say anything.

519
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,951
You spat it in the garbage.

520
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,953
See, this is how
it's always been with him.

521
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,915
A subtle raised eyebrow,
then straight to raining frogs. Here.

522
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,667
Taste this, tell him it's delicious.

523
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,959
Uh, not sure I should.

524
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,878
Go ahead, child. Taste it.

525
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,421
- It's fine.
- Of course it's fine.

526
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,757
That's why I want her to taste it.
Taste it.

527
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,234
- [Chloe] No...
- [Lucifer] Taste it!

528
00:27:57,258 --> 00:28:00,887
[whispers] I just don't think that
I should get in the middle of this.

529
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,473
I would really prefer not to.

530
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,642
So, good to see you. Excuse me.

531
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:06,810
[grunts]

532
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,979
- Now look what you did.
- [groans]

533
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,356
- Come with me.
- [knocking]

534
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,984
Ah! Taste this.

535
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,493
[both sighing]

536
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,580
[sighs]

537
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:30,875
[sighs]

538
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,296
[Linda] I find these things are...

539
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,758
usually never really about...

540
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:40,885
the coffee.

541
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,804
Perhaps you two could

542
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:47,267
care to discuss what this is<i> really </i>about?

543
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,730
Okay. Okay.

544
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:55,567
Okay, he comes down here,
judging every little thing,

545
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,069
which is ironic
because he <i>made</i> every little thing.

546
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:02,115
Made all of us imperfect and then
criticizes us for not measuring up.

547
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:06,661
So, photoshop your selfies,
prepare ye the way for Mr. Judgy-pants.

548
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:11,791
Is this one of those times when
you say one thing and mean another?

549
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,668
Because I certainly didn't invent that.

550
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,170
If you're referring to sarcasm,

551
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:18,089
I'm not smart-alecky
enough to take credit for that.

552
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,842
Smart being in the title,
to which I'm sure you'll disagree.

553
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,218
There it goes again.

554
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,763
Okay. God, perhaps
we should start with you.

555
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,724
Has Lucifer done
anything recently to anger you?

556
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,059
[chuckles] Of course not.

557
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,020
I'm not angry about anything.

558
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:36,149
[chuckles] So, what? You just
banished me to Hell for shiggles?

559
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,901
Be honest!

560
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:40,987
You were pissed that
I threatened your superhero status

561
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,697
and you were dying to punish me.

562
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,199
You wanted me to suffer.

563
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,743
- It's impossible to make him happy.
- [laughs]

564
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:49,829
If I give my opinion, I'm controlling.

565
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,874
If I stand back
and let him make his own decisions,

566
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,752
I'm the distant father
with the "mysterious ways."

567
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:59,172
Whatever I do,
he assumes the worst possible intentions.

568
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,674
That's because nothing
is ever good enough for you.

569
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:04,469
"Why don't you have a desk?
Why doesn't your car have a roof?"

570
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:06,471
"Why's your kitchen
just a wall of Scotch?"

571
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:09,432
I was merely trying
to take an interest in your life.

572
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:12,560
He turned my crime scene
into a music video. [chuckles]

573
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:18,107
<i>And</i> I do believe I detected
a certain baritone singing the loudest.

574
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:21,528
It's baritone-tenor split, and
I can't help myself if the music starts.

575
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,780
You know that,
and that's why you're doing it!

576
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:25,865
- That's why you're doing it.
- Time out!

577
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,203
Wanna know what I think?

578
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:33,581
Oh, this is where the advice comes in,
so try to pay attention.

579
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,875
I wouldn't want you
to "misinterpret" anything.

580
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,962
You. You are an archangel.

581
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,297
You're able to fly.

582
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,715
Live forever.

583
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,969
Coax the desires out of all humanity.

584
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:47,719
Fly.

585
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,221
And you...

586
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,517
<i>you</i> are Almighty God.

587
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,063
You are <i>the</i> most important being
in the entire universe.

588
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:01,067
- You made the universe. You did that.
- [Lucifer scoffs]

589
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,361
You've had millennia

590
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:07,115
to evolve beyond all the petty squabbles
that we have down here on Earth.

591
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,868
[chuckles] And yet, you haven't.

592
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,912
You're basically
just like all of us. [chuckles]

593
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,664
I mean, maybe even worse,

594
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:18,585
if you consider all the time
that you've had to evolve...

595
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:22,714
[laughs]...beyond all of this nonsense.

596
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:26,175
I mean, take this father-son discord.

597
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:30,722
So your son didn't turn out
exactly how you'd hoped.

598
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,390
So he can't fly.

599
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,726
I think we've
already established that I can fly.

600
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,103
You know what a good father does?

601
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,479
He loves his son.

602
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,857
Unconditionally.

603
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:44,569
Even if he doesn't have
a fancy pair of wings.

604
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,572
No matter what.

605
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,617
Supports him.

606
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,078
You smell what I'm cooking?

607
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,915
Uh, usually she's quite perceptive,

608
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,876
but I suppose everyone
has an off day now and then.

609
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,172
I believe I smell what you're cooking.

610
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:07,926
In fact,
I think I know exactly what to do.

611
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,933
Get ready to be supported, son.

612
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,810
Okay.

613
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,397
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

614
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:24,943
Believe me, crabs are not a part
of humanity you want to experience.

615
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,236
[chuckles] Whatever you say, son.

616
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:31,532
[sniffs, groans]

617
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,369
Excuse me, do you know
where we can find Coach McVey?

618
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:37,747
- Should be here any minute.
- Great. Thank you so much.

619
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:43,836
What a lovely, sweaty room
you've brought me to, Lucifer.

620
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,546
- Are you two okay?
- Hmm.

621
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,508
Couldn't be better.
I'm just happy to be here with my boy,

622
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:51,844
having some affirming, receptive fun.
Speaking of...

623
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,555
- Go deep, son.
- What?

624
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:57,766
Nice...

625
00:32:58,768 --> 00:32:59,852
block! [chuckles]

626
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,480
Please tell me you're Coach McVey.

627
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:03,773
Can I help you?

628
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:06,109
- Yes...
- [God] That's my son Lucifer.

629
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:08,111
He's a very important assist...

630
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,697
consultant for the police.

631
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,491
Doesn't have a desk
because he likes to stay on the move.

632
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:15,575
Right.

633
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,289
I'm Detective Decker, LAPD.
What can you tell us about Steve Rockwell?

634
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,790
I'm sorry, who?

635
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:25,294
Well, a witness said they saw you
arguing a few days before his death.

636
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:30,466
- Oh, you mean "unnecessary ref-ness"?
- [Lucifer chuckles]

637
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:34,512
Look, not to speak ill,
but that guy was a judgmental prick.

638
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,016
Well, it's sort of
his job to pass judgment.

639
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,852
Yeah, but he didn't have to be so
goddamned sanctimonious about it.

640
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,770
Oh, please don't bring me into this.

641
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:46,524
[sighs] Yes, it's not what they say.
It's the way they say it. Am I right?

642
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,401
Wait, you're not here because you think

643
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,570
I had anything to do
with what happened to the ref.

644
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,196
I mean, I'm the last guy.

645
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,615
That dumb-ass call
got us into the playoffs.

646
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,493
Then why did we find your prints
on the poisoned whistle?

647
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:58,577
[Lucifer] Hmm.

648
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,664
Okay, maybe I need a lawyer.

649
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:06,794
Or maybe you'd like to tell us
what it is that you truly desire.

650
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:08,796
I...

651
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,507
- I...
- Mm-hmm.

652
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,552
I wanna be tackled
by a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader.

653
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:18,264
The CIF championship
would get me to the university level.

654
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:21,476
[sighs] And a few years of that,
I'd be doing pros in no time.

655
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,604
- And by doing pros, I mean, well...
- [grunts]

656
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:27,440
- You know what I mean. [laughs]
- Yes, I know what you mean.

657
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,650
- Excellent use of your special talent.
- [sighs]

658
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,111
One you can't take credit for,
might I remind you,

659
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,363
since I know we self-actualize, so yay me.

660
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,615
Hmm. Yes, of course.

661
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:38,409
But technically,
I made you self-actualize,

662
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,828
so, team effort. Up high!

663
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,831
[Chloe] Anyhow, so I did some digging.

664
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,584
The very same day
you were seen arguing with Rockwell,

665
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:50,755
you made a big withdrawal
from your bank account. $5,000 in cash?

666
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:53,966
Yes, perhaps you made a deal
with the referee to make a bad call

667
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,593
and then decided not to pay up.

668
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:58,678
Look...

669
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,141
a week before the game,
I did offer him a payout,

670
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:05,186
just to, like, you know,
nudge things my way.

671
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:08,064
But Mr. High and Mighty...
[scoffs] He turned me down.

672
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,941
Then we get to game time,

673
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:12,735
and he actually does throw
a make-or-break in my favor.

674
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:17,532
Worst call I've ever seen. So I figured
he was just posturing before.

675
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:21,410
So I go to pay him off, he acts like
he doesn't know what I'm talking about.

676
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,870

A couple of days ago,
someone broke into my truck, my baby.

And they took my bag.
It was just dirty clothes, but...

my whistle was in there.

we found some long hairs stuck down

- Maybe Van Ness was one of 'em?
- Definitely possible.

But whoever killed Steve must've known
about the fight between him and McVey.

828

Right. Or they wouldn't
have known who to frame.

No, but we do have a new lead.

896
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,416
Seems like the killer
came from this school

897

and not one of the two
involved with the bad call.

Yes, someone with
an abundance of school spirit.

hundreds of students at this school.

- Unless you have a way to narrow it down.
- Actually, we do.

We tested the poison
that killed your husband,

902
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:55,562
and the chemical components
can't be bought over the counter,

903
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:59,066
but they could be ordered
from, say, a school chemistry lab.

like I said, Steve had a lot of enemies.

[song ends]

1024
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,909
[God] Oh, my son, the Light Bringer.

1025
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,829
So full of light...

1026
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:59,249
that it blinds even you sometimes.

1027
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:01,960
[inhales] What does that mean?

1028
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,587
It means, I understand...

1029
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:07,674
that you're angry at me.

1030
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:10,802
And I'm so very sorry about that.

1031
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:14,639
So, you're sorry for me,

1032
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:17,600
but you're not sorry
for what you've done.

1033
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,644
I didn't say that.

1034
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:24,649
But I will say
that I cannot fix <i>you,</i> Lucifer.

1035
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:27,861
But you're God.

1036
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,074
[sighs]

1037
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:36,494
[sniffles] Okay, fine.

1038
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:37,954
If you can't fix me, Dad,

1039
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:40,790
then at least stop trying to control me.

1040
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:42,876
How do I control you?

1041
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:45,587
You just made me sing again!

1042
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:48,298
I mean, it has to stop, Dad. [sobs]

1043
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,303
Actually, I...

1044
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:56,723
I don't think that's possible.

1045
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:59,142
[groans] Right,
well, if you're not gonna try,

1046
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:01,436
then I don't know why I should bother.

1047
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:03,313
It's not that I won't.

1048
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:08,234
It's that I'm not sure I can. [sobs]

1049

[scoffs]

1050
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:13,990
What does <i>that</i> mean?

1051
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,661
My powers, son.

[shudders]

1053
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,337
I think I'm losing control of them.

1054
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:37,972
Dad?
