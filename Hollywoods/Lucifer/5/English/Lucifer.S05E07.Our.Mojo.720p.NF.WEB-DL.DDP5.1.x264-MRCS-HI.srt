1
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,390
[police siren wails in distance]

2
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:26,860
[Chloe sighs]

3
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,445
Mm.

4
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,455
[moans, chuckles]

5
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,206
[snores, snorts loudly]

6
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:42,625
[gasps, exhales]

7
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,879
Oh. Hi.

8
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:46,962
Hello.

9
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,382
Was I snoring like a truck driver?

10
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:55,305
You know what, don't answer that,
'cause I just remembered you don't lie.

11
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,389
[Lucifer] Mm.

12
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,476
[both kissing]

13
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,561
Good morning, Detective.

14
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:02,644
Good morning.

15
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,022
Are you cold?

16
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,774
Cold? No, why?

17
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,232
Odd,

18
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,944
given that Hell was
supposed to freeze over.

19
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,863
- [laughs]
- Hmm.

20
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,991
Right, 'cause I said that I wouldn't
have sex with you until Hell...

21
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,868
Yes, yes, you think you're very funny.

22
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:19,621
Oh, I know I'm very funny. [chuckles]

23
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:22,749
I also know that you are ticklish.

24
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,501
- Mwah!
- [laughs]

25
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,797
- [laughing] Oh, my gosh! Okay, okay!
- [Lucifer laughs]

26
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,215
Okay.

27
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,675
I am starving.

28
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,053
So what do you feel like?

29
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,806
Eggs or pancakes?

30
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:38,890
- Mm.
- An old fashioned?

31
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,184
Whatever you want is dandy.

32
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,478
[chuckles] Oh, come on.

33
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,689
You must have some preference.

34
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,774
[sighs]

35
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,114
What do you truly desire?

36
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:57,825
I...

37
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,663
I want to have sex with you
another four times.

38
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:02,746
Six, actually.

39
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,124
What...

40
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,419
Did I just mojo you?

41
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,755
I don't know. [chuckles]

42
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:12,714
I...

43
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,425
[chuckles] You're messing with me.

44
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,386
[laughs] Am I?

45
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,303
Yes!

46
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,347
[snorts] You're messing with me.

47
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,891
- You are so silly. [laughs]
- Oh.

48
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,268
Okay. Hungry.

49
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,019
Oh. [scoffs]

50
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,480
Okay.

51
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,484
You know what? Breakfast burritos.

52
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,819
I'm getting breakfast burritos.

53
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,237
Doctor!

54
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,200
I need your help with a most pressing...

55
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,661
- [mechanical pumping]
- What is that sound?

56
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:42,744
Oh.

57
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:43,954
My boobs.

58
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,292
I'm pumping. Wearable breast pumps.

59
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,294
Best invention since the epidural.

60
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,420
Hmm.

61
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,798
The detective has mojo.

62
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:55,967
She... What?

63
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,927
We had sex, and then this morning...

64
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,011
Wow. Wait...

65
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,763
You guys had sex?

66
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,515
Finally!

67
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,267
This is wonderful!

68
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,645
Well, it was wonderful, yes.
Of course it was, but like I was saying,

69
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,273
tiny hiccup, she can now do what I do.

70
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:11,858
Expose people's desires.

71
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:12,984
Well, how did that happen?

72
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:16,029
I don't know, Doctor.
Why do you think I've come to see you?

73
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:17,738
All I know is,

74
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,158
she didn't have mojo, then we had sex,
and now she does.

75
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,161
How did you even find out
that she could do that?

76
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,745
Well, only by accident.

77
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:27,332
She's seen me do it quite a bit, so
she did it as a joke, and it happened to...

78
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,501
Hold on.

79
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,003
Do you think it's possible

80
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:36,007
I've given my power to everyone I've ever
had sex with and just never knew it?

81
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,469
Uh... Who, me?

82
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:40,844
No.

83
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:44,432
Well, we did the deed, several times,
and in, you know, all sorts of positions.

84
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,934
Yes, I remember.

85
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:47,518
How could I forget?

86
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,978
Anyway... But, Lucifer,

87
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,231
your mojo is like a superpower.

88
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,314
I don't have it.

89
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,566
[mechanical pumping]

90
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:54,691
Or do I?

91
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,088
- I guess I've never tried.
- Well, let's try now. Come on.

92
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,739
Lean in. Look into my eyes.

93
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:00,907
Ask me what I desire.

94
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,326
[squeals] This is good. I mean...

95
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,036
Lucifer...

96
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:08,915
what do you desire?

97
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,044
No.Nada. Totally limp.

98
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,212
Oof. Ouch.

99
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,506
Well, that's several million
bullets dodged.

100
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,300
So it's just the detective
who's the problem.

101
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,844
- Why does it have to be a problem?
- Because...

102
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,972
desire is my thing.

103
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,849
My mojo is the reason
I'm useful to her in the first place.

104
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,686
If she can do it, too,
what's my role in the partnership?

105
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,271
Who even am I?

106
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,399
Okay, so you don't think that you can
share this with her and still be you?

107
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,443
Lucifer, that's what
being in a relationship is,

108
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,071
sharing without losing yourself
in the process.

109
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,948
- Uh...?
- Besides,

110
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:47,328
the fact that Chloe can nowÂ mojo people,
too, doesn't mean that you have to stop.

111
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,621
You're right.

112
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,249
[chuckles] You're right.

113
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:54,502
I am, and always will be,
master of the mojo.

114
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:55,753
- Mm.
- King of desire.

115
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:56,671
Yeah.

116
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,381
Sultan of humans' innermost wishes.

117
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,882
Thank you, Doctor. Yeah...

118
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,509
"What is it you desire?"

119
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,344
"Excuse me, what is it you desire?"

120
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,345
[mechanical pumping]

121
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,888
Still pumping.

122
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,559
[police horn bleating]

123
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,436
- Decker!
- Hey.

124
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,398
So, did you and Lucifer finally get over
your issues and under the covers

125
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,233
for the old no-pants dance?

126
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,651
We sure did.

127
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,321
Well, I'm so sorry, Decker.
You know, sometimes...

128
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,990
Wait, I'm sorry.

129
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:24,949
Rewind.

130
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,659
Did you just say yes?

131
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,160
Uh-huh.

132
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,079
OMG!

133
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,164
Oh! [spluttering]

134
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,791
I was so ready to have
my Deckerstar dreams crushed again.

135
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,210
- Why?
- 'Cause it's been one bummer after another

136
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,338
with you two.
I didn't want to get my hopes up.

137
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,756
Yeah, I know.

138
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,760
I mean, it has been a long road,
but, well, here we are.

139
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,053
Cool beans.

140
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:48,389
Wait, why do I get the feeling that
you're not just asking to ask? What's up?

141
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,141
Busted. Okay.

142
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,518
I couldn't wait to tell you
about <i>my </i>thing.

143
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,442
- Oh, you have a thing?
- I might have a thing.

144
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,441
So, remember that reporter
who seemed way too nice to be my type?

145
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,776
Yeah, so, um, you know,

146
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,111
I-I decided to give it a shot,

147
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,364
- and we met up last night...
- Ooh!

148
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,573
...and let me tell you,

149
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,618
- he is not always too nice.
- [gasps]

150
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,120
Morning, Miss Lopez. Morning, Detective.

151
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,705
Good morning again, Lucifer.

152
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:13,789
[Lucifer chuckles]

153
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,795
Uh, sorry for the delay.
I had to make a pit stop at Linda's.

154
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,505
So, what have we got?

155
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:24,467
Any witnesses or suspects on whom
my uncanny interview skills are required,

156
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,885
if you know what I mean?

157
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:29,097
Uh, I actually have no information
on the victim yet.

158
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,807
Ella, is, um... Is...

159
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,227
- Ella, is Dan here yet?
- Ah!

160
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,896
Oh, El Espinoza called in sick,
I'm afraid.

161
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,524
Ugh, did he look in the mirror again?
I told him not to do that.

162
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,317
[Lucifer chuckles]

163
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:44,862
We should...

164
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:45,946
Right.

165
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,076
[camera clicks]

166
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,831
[Ella] Diane Luna, famous soprano.

167
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,499
Time of death, 10:00 p.m. last night.

168
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,668
Check out this puncture mark.

169
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:02,088
My guess, toxicology reports will confirm
that she was injected

170
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,714
with some sort of paralytic agent.

171
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,383
- Is that how she died?
- Worse.

172
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,634
Much worse.

173
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,928
You see this blood stain pattern
on these lilies?

174
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,723
That's from Diane coughing
as she was choking on her own blood.

175
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,309
The killer inserted a knife
into her throat,

176
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:18,354
made twoÂ very precise cuts,
slashing her vocal cords.

177
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,940
Sounds like someone went
to a lot of trouble to make a point.

178
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:24,110
Yes, I smell an annoyed neighbor
who's tired of her singing.

179
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,073
Shall I go mojo them all?
I should, shouldn't I?

180
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:30,158
Well, there's no sign of forced entry,
so most likely Diane knew her assailant.

181
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:33,411
[sighs] Well, a jilted lover, then,
based on the flowers.

182
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:36,038
Except she was a famous opera star.
I mean, look.

183
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,748
They have flowers all the time.

184
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,750
Ella, who found the body?

185
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,752
Oh, uh, Norman, Diane's neighbor.

186
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:42,962
- Over there.
- [Lucifer] Ah!

187
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:45,715
Right the first time.
Annoyed neighbor, it is.

188
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:49,594
Yeah, apparently he found the door ajar,
came across the body, and phoned it in.

189
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:50,678
That's what he says.

190
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:51,761
This way, Detective.

191
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,515
I suspect we're about to hear
this suspect's confession.

192
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,271
- Excuse me.
- I wasn't.

193
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,690
Hi. Detective Decker.
Can we ask you a few questions?

194
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:03,774
Sure.

195
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:07,612
It must have been pretty irritating
living right next door to a soprano, hmm?

196
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,947
You wanted to silence her
once and for all, didn't you?

197
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,992
Learn from the master. Tell me, Norman...

198
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:14,619
Normsky...

199
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:17,038
- [mystical ringing]
- ...what is it you desire?

200
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,957
[mystical ringing fades]

201
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,416
What?

202
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,212
That's a weird thing to ask, man.

203
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,879
Not working.

204
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,380
But...

205
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,090
that means...

206
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,179
Detective, I think you stole my mojo.

207
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,356
Never mind.

208
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:46,859
Hello, Wyrzbeski.

209
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,945
Tell me, apart from
a more pronounceable name,

210
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,154
what do you desire?

211
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,323
Is this about Secret Santa?

212
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,617
'Cause you're not supposed to ask people
what they want.

213
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,743
That, uh...

214
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:56,869
That gives it away.

215
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,495
Jeez.

216
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,580
"Santa"?

217
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,708
Uh, excuse me.

218
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,961
I couldn't have done this.

219
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,338
- I spent the whole night in Northrend.
- Where?

220
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,799
- Excuse me, Officer, what do you desire?
- Northrend.

221
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:10,925
In Azeroth?

222
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,427
Ah, yes, we're...
We're talking video games?

223
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:14,804
I led my guild on

224
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,431
- a 17-hourÂ campaign last night.
- [Lucifer] Excuse me, Officer.

225
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,392
So you were home and awake all night?

226
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,143
- Did you hear anything?
- Did I?

227
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:25,064
First, the awful vocal exercises,
like every damn night,

228
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,984
but then, as an annoying bonus,
two hours of arguing.

229
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,787
- What were they arguing about?
- Excuse me!

230
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,572
And did you get any details at all,
names, anything?

231
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,489
No.

232
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,616
Once I realized the noise wasn't stopping,

233
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,744
I cranked up my headset
so I could hear my raiding party.

234
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:43,082
It's getting so a guy can't plunder
a Lich King's barrow in peace anymore.

235
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,001
Mm. Tough times.

236
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:48,796
Yes, so we're going to need
your game log to confirm your alibi.

237
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,088
Unbelievable.

238
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,257
[police radio chatter]

239
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,883
Excuse me. [clears throat]

240
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,261
Lucifer, what are you doing?

241
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,013
Literally nothing. I'm powerless.

242
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,974
Did you really lose your mojo?
How is that possible?

243
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,934
When we had sex, it passed from me to you.

244
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,561
That's ridiculous. I...

245
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,355
We were only playing around this morning.

246
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,399
I don't have your mojo.

247
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,942
There's only one way to be sure.

248
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,612
Right now? No!

249
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,655
I'm not gonna mojo you here.

250
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,449
- It's not gonna work anyhow.
- Please try.

251
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,532
Try.

252
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:18,908
Fine.

253
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:25,833
What do you desire?

254
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,255
I... want my mojo back.

255
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,381
[Chloe gasps]

256
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,885
Ha! [clears throat]

257
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:37,970
Oh, my God.

258
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,263
[spluttering]

259
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,347
I...

260
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:41,848
It's real. It's...

261
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:42,933
[chuckles]

262
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,311
- ...cool.
- No, not cool.

263
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,147
Lucifer, we just got together.

264
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,733
You're already finding things
to freak out about.

265
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,486
I'm not finding anything, Detective.
All I've done is lose stuff.

266
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:56,989
Do you realize how long
it took for us to get here?

267
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,575
We finally have something good going on.

268
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,162
I mean, can we please
just enjoy it for a minute?

269
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,832
[chuckles lightly]

270
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,375
Of course.

271
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,419
Of course.

272
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,260
[monotonous humming]

273
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:24,975
That cannot be right.

274
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,145
[Amenadiel groans]

275
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,314
[toy squeaks]

276
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,879
Linda said that you were out with Dan,

277
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,237
dodging baseball bats.

278
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,240
Mm, we were supposed to go
to the Dodger baseball game.

279
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,033
Oh. That's much more lame.

280
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,369
No, what's lame is
Dan ditched me last minute.

281
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,537
So I just...

282
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,259
I just came back here
to get some work done.

283
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,377
"Work"? Building more stuff for Charlie?

284
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,837
How much does that kid need?

285
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,756
I had two rocks when I was growing up.

286
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,216
One sharp, one not.

287
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,997
Take the sharp one and try to stab things.
Take the dull one, try to make it sharp.

288
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,263
That, um...

289
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:03,848
That explains a lot.

290
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,517
It explains why I'm not a spoiled brat,

291
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,811
which is exactly what Charlie's
going to become

292
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,938
if you keep buying him more toys.

293
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,566
This is not a toy, Maze.

294
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:17,653
This is a stimulating,
educational recreation-scape

295
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,737
that if you...

296
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,741
[groans, chuckles]

297
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,034
You know, the truth is
when Dan didn't show up,

298
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,746
coming back here was
the only thing that occurred to me.

299
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,666
[sighs] How pathetic is that?

300
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,750
Mm.

301
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:37,006
I can't even remember how I spent my time
before I had Charlie.

302
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:53,606
Okay, well, according to Diane's calendar,
at the time her neighbor heard the fight,

303
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,942
our victim was meeting with someone
named Mario Canales.

304
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,570
Well, if it was a standing
weekly appointment,

305
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,906
I'm sure Diane knew Mario Canales well.

306
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,365
Let me see what's online.

307
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,412
Okay, so he's got a website,

308
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,998
and it looks like he's a vocal coach.

309
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,794
Oh! Well, if the appointment was
a weekly coaching session,

310
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,463
that would explain the noises
that Norman was complaining about.

311
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,340
Yeah. What about the argument?

312
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,383
Oh, okay. I...

313
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,551
Ay-ay-ay!

314
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,471
Check out Diane and Mario's text chain.

315
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,472
Correction,

316
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,474
- <i>sext </i>chain.
- Oh!

317
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:32,353
Nothing wrong with inserting
a little creativity into throat exercises.

318
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,563
[Ella]
That is some strong emoji game there.

319
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,566
Although, it's really making me crave
my mom's eggplant tacos.

320
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,944
- Oh!
- Wait, so they were having an affair?

321
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,696
It says here that he's married with kids.

322
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,783
Well, maybe the vocal coach was worried
that Diane would sing to his wife,

323
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,493
so he cut her off before she could.

324
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,578
Right. Right, let's go talk to Mario.

325
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,663
- Ow!
- Oh!

326
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:51,747
[Ella] Oh!

327
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:52,706
Oh, my gosh!

328
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,543
- Pete, are you okay?
- Ow! What's wrong with that door?

329
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,170
- Oh, uh, sorry.
- Hey, um... Hi.

330
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,298
Sorry. I didn't mean
to interrupt you at work.

331
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:06,345
But I scored these two VIP tickets
to the<i> Star Trek</i> convention downtown.

332
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:09,723
I-I have no idea if you're into it,
but it's totally my thing,

333
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,142
and I was wondering
if you wanted to come with me.

334
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,227
<i>Star Trek?</i>

335
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:16,647
Please, Miss Lopez knows more
about that stuff than you ever could.

336
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,317
[speaking Klingon]

337
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,111
See? She even speaksÂ Chewbacca.

338
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:26,073
[speaking Klingon]

339
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:29,743
[speaking Klingon]

340
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,329
[both speaking Klingon]

341
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,081
But... But <i>Star Trek</i> is your thing.

342
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,542
Well, I mean,

343
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,962
Lucifer, the 24thÂ century
is big enough for the both of us.

344
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:41,796
[Chloe] See?

345
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,465
Sharing's not that hard.

346
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,010
[Ella and Pete speak indistinctly]

347
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,721
Excuse me.

348
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,265
I'm Detective Decker.
We're looking for a MarioÂ Canales.

349
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,808
Uh, he's kind of busy right now.

350
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,185
[Chloe] Not so busy anymore.

351
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,525
Bravo, Mr. Canales.

352
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,570
A-list vocal coach by day,
Z-list jingle singer by night.

353
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:05,653
Oh, wow.

354
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,407
Look, it's happening already.
Our mojo's working on him.

355
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,284
Aw, you called it "our" mojo.

356
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,702
[chuckles] Now, go on.

357
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,287
Go in for the coup de grÃ¢ce.

358
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:15,747
You've got this.

359
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,959
Mr. Canales, I'm Detective Decker,

360
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,961
and I need to ask you a few questions.

361
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,132
What do you desire?

362
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,803
To tell you anything you want to know.

363
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,138
Very good.

364
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:34,141
What <i>we </i>want to know is,
why did you kill Diane Luna?

365
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,977
W-Wait, Diane is dead?

366
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,939
The performance is over, Mario.
We've seen your eggplant.

367
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,815
We know you were having an affair
with Diane.

368
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,299
Did she threaten to tell your wife?

369
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,027
What? No.

370
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,529
My... My marriage has been over
for almost a year.

371
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,491
Well, the happy family photos
on your website suggest otherwise.

372
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:53,619
[sighs] Look, I only keep those up
for appearances' sake.

373
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,388
Then why'd you fight
the night of her murder?

374
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,789
Well, isn't it obvious?

375
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,833
Mr. Canales taught Diane all his tricks,
and then she rose above him.

376
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,544
The pupil leaving the master.
I mean, who'd enjoy that?

377
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,712
I did.

378
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,381
I was so proud of Diane.

379
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,133
And besides, she was my best calling card.

380
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,136
That's why we fought.
I didn't want her to throw it all away.

381
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,513
Why would she throw it all away?

382
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:16,892
She... She was about to go public with some
major accusations against an opera star.

383
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,644
I tried to talk her out of it.

384
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,479
An opera star? Who?

385
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,066
You didn't hear this from me...

386
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:29,905
but Niels Schuman is a tyrant and a bully.

387
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,782
Niels Schuman, the world-class baritone?

388
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,326
Yeah, he's a world-class jerk.

389
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,370
He throws things at people.

390
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,205
He flies into fits of rage for no reason.

391
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,541
- Oh?
- Diane wanted to bring him down.

392
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,084
I told her it would end her.

393
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,167
Sounds like it did.

394
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,714
So you think Niels is behind this?

395
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,642
[crows cawing]

396
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,521
I miss you so much.

397
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,400
So damn much, Charlotte.

398
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,070
You fought so hard to be a better person.

399
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,366
And you made me believe
I could be better, too.

400
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,118
[sighs]

401
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,579
And I'm trying.

402
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,124
But I always fall short.

403
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,418
And now I've seen something.

404
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,300
Something that proves just how important
it is to get it right.

405
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:34,845
To be good.

406
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,264
[whimpers softly]

407
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,512
And the good news is I'm...

408
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,560
I'm pretty sure
this means that you're in Heaven,

409
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:42,978
just likeÂ Amenadiel said.

410
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,485
But the bad news is
I don't think I'm gonna be joining you.

411
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,568
[sobs]

412
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,492
I'm terrified, Charlotte.

413
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,121
[spluttering] For me, for Chloe...

414
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,126
for Trixie.

415
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,967
I need help. I just need help.

416
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,097
I need guidance.

417
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,017
I need... I need a sign, I need something.

418
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,351
Help me.

419
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:24,644
Please.

420
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,230
Help me.

421
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:29,900
[mystical whooshing]

422
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,580
Daniel Espinoza,

423
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,291
your prayers have been answered.

424
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,711
- Lucifer?
- I am not Lucifer.

425
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,795
Look.

426
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,756
He did this to me.

427
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:57,344
My twin brother hates me
because I am his opposite.

428
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,180
The good to his bad.

429
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,474
Perhaps you've heard of me.

430
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,894
I'm the Archangel Michael.

431
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:08,522
The Archangel?

432
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,150
I know that you're struggling.

433
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:15,529
I know that you're afraid
of going to Hell.

434
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,282
But I bring you good news, Daniel.

435
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,450
Your redemption is not lost.

436
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:24,121
There is a way for you to right
all your wrongs.

437
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:25,746
A way for you...

438
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,041
to protect your loved ones.

439
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,010
[elevator dings]

440
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:39,927
Lucifer.

441
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,223
Um, so Mario's alibi checks out,

442
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,975
and we can't question Niels

443
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,226
'cause he's in the air,

444
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,478
flying back from a performance
in New York.

445
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:53,567
So, really, there's nothing we can do
until he lands.

446
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,235
I disagree.

447
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,113
[gasps] Lucifer.

448
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,365
As fun as it is to watch you use my...

449
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,035
I mean,Â <i>our, </i>but really <i>my</i> mojo,

450
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,578
I'd like it back. So...

451
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,122
let's have sex again, me on top this time.

452
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,206
[Chloe chuckles]

453
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,542
Do you really think that's going to work?

454
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:14,213
As if your mojo is some sort of STD?

455
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:18,091
[scoffs] Well, we have to try something.

456
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,137
[sighs]
This is really getting to you, huh?

457
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,263
[sighs]

458
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,139
Trust me,

459
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:30,229
it's not like I don't want to have sex
with you, because I really, really do,

460
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:33,649
but... putting this kind of agenda on it,

461
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,068
it just sucks all the fun out of it.

462
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:39,738
Yeah, and please do not make a pun
right now because I...

463
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,241
I am a little worried

464
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:45,494
that you're having such a hard time
sharing this with me, because...

465
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,372
relationships are about give-and-take.

466
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:52,459
Well, that's easy for you to say.
So far, it's all, "I give and you take."

467
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,795
I mean emotionally, Lucifer.

468
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,382
Oh...

469
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,760
I know exactly what you mean. [chuckles]

470
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:03,929
So, couples therapy?

471
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:07,933
When we've been a couple for, what,
five seconds?

472
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,227
It's definitely not what I meant.

473
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,144
I see.

474
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:15,357
But I'm afraid, in order for this to work,
you both have to be willing to be here.

475
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,920
- Well, she said she was happy to do this.
- No, no, I'm happy.

476
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,403
I'm happy to be here.

477
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:22,030
I'm thrilled, actually,
to have someone rational

478
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,491
weigh in on all of this
and agree with this.

479
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,702
I mean, Lucifer's being ridiculous, okay?

480
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,704
Can you please tell him

481
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:32,624
that it makes zero sense
that I stole his mojo during sex?

482
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,209
- [mock chuckle]
- Okay, well,

483
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,296
actually, I don't think
Lucifer is being...

484
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,589
that ridiculous.

485
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,508
- You don't?
- No.

486
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,386
It's not like we covered celestial powers
in med school.

487
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,513
- [Lucifer chuckles]
- But having sex with someone

488
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,098
you truly care about

489
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:51,685
requires surrendering control,
giving up power.

490
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,729
And on an emotional level,

491
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:57,482
Lucifer's reasoning does make
some amount of sense.

492
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,984
Thank you, Doctor.

493
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:03,613
And the fact that he came to this
emotionally mature insight on his own...

494
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,365
Impressive.

495
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,367
Shows a sign that he's grown.

496
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,535
Bully for me.

497
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,246
Now can we jump to the part
where you teach the detective how to,

498
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,165
you know, return my mojo?

499
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,584
Yeah... Scratch emotional maturity.

500
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:19,338
Okay, so, look.
Try to put yourself in Lucifer's shoes.

501
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,547
For instance,

502
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,674
what if your gun and badge
were taken away,

503
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,634
only to be given to Lucifer?

504
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,470
Liking the sound of that. Go on.

505
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,680
I'm sorry, I'm... I'm not following.

506
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,475
Being a detective is a big part
of your identity.

507
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:32,559
It empowers you.

508
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,770
Now imagine losing it.

509
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,731
Okay, Lucifer's issues
can sometimes seem...

510
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,400
"Outlandish" would be putting it mildly.

511
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,111
- [scoffs]
- But the one thing that I've learned

512
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:46,698
is that there's usually something
buried underneath,

513
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,910
sometimes deep, deep, <i>deep</i> down,

514
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,329
but ultimately meaningful,

515
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,706
and worth trying to understand.

516
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,544
<i>âª Gimme some of that power âª</i>

517
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:04,757
Hey.

518
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,761
You said you wanted
to introduce me to someone?

519
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,180
Amenadiel. Hmm.

520
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,476
Meet your old self.

521
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,896
You sounded like you needed a break
from all that "dad" stuff.

522
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,691
- Put it on.
- Maze, I really don't think this is...

523
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:29,824
Maze, what are you...

524
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,618
[Maze grunts]

[Amenadiel grunts]

527
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:43,839
This is not what I meant.

[Amenadiel groans]

529
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:48,844
Of course not,

530
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,973
because now, all you are is
a lame-ass baby daddy. [laughs]

531
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,101
[Maze shouts]

532
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,480
[Amenadiel roars]

533
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,024
[Maze grunts, chuckles]

534
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,777
Don't lie.

535
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,071
You're enjoying this.

536
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,490
[neck crackles]

537
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,331
[both grunting and exclaiming]

538
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,047
[Maze strains]

539
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,716
[Maze panting]

540
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,312
[Maze grunting, moaning]

541
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,855
This isn't working!

542
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,484
This isn't working.

543
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:52,449
Yeah, I don't...

544
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,326
I don't think this is what I need.

545
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,119
I wasn't talking about you.

546
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,456
This isn't working for me.

547
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,506
[sighs]

548
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:13,553
[opera singing playing]

549
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,359
[stagehand] Keep coming, keep coming.

550
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,278
This way, a little bit.

551
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,364
[singing continues]

552
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,825
You know, I've been thinking,
and Linda does have a point.

553
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,786
Feeling powerless is no joke.

554
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:41,957
I just... I'm so used to
dismissing yourÂ crazy antics

555
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,500
that I haven't been taking you...

556
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:44,751
Seriously?

557
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,044
A gun?

558
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,837
Well, I like to call it "our" gun.

559
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,757
Don't worry, it's all properly permitted.

560
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,260
Well, outlandish, for sure, but...

561
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,721
if this is the emotional crutch
that you feel you need

562
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,723
to deal with the loss of your mojo,

563
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:02,811
then I will do my very best
to be understanding.

564
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,521
- Thank you.
- [chuckles]

565
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:07,607
Not in my eyeline!

566
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,109
- Ow!
- [growls]

567
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,193
Charming.

568
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:15,782
- LAPD.
- LAPD.

569
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,285
[Niels] Ah.

570
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,412
This must be about Diane.

571
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,539
Awful, what happened to her.

572
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,499
[Lucifer] A relief for you, I'm sure.

573
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:25,916
Excuse me?

574
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:29,212
We know she was gathering witnesses
to go on record against you,

575
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:33,091
and had collected a lot of evidence
about your abusive behavior.

576
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:36,720
Enough to make you want to go
snippety-snip on her vocal cords.

577
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:39,931
[scoffs] Her accusations couldn't hurt me.

578
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,516
Because they're false?

579
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,853
No, they're absolutely true,
but irrelevant.

580
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,898
After all, I am the best,

581
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,067
and it's not illegal

582
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,862
to demand nothing but the best

583
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:56,865
from those who get to work with me.

584
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:00,702
Well, the allegations are serious enough
to hurt your career,

585
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,497
make sponsors drop you,
open you up to lawsuits.

586
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,583
The worse the reputation, the better.

587
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:11,129
Let it scare off those losers
who can't cut it.

588
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:16,176
No, I have no reason to want Diane dead.

589
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,635
Detective...

590
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,265
would you like to use your
newly acquired charms on this lovely chap?

591
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,893
- No. no. no.
- [Chloe] Well, yes, I would.

592
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,936
I just don't want
to rub salt in your wound.

593
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,022
Well, obviously I'd love you
to rub something else,

594
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:32,400
but we're learning to share, aren't we?
Hmm?

595
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,197
[clears throat] Right.

596
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:42,743
Niels...

597
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,331
what do you

598
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:47,915
desire?

599
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,003
Frankly...

600
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:59,094
for this to be over with
so I can go back to my photo shoot.

601
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,971
Oh... Say, "truly desire."

602
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:03,597
- "Truly."
- Yes.

603
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,142
[clears throat]

604
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,185
Niels...

605
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,020
what do you

606
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:12,732
<i>truly</i> desire?

607
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,072
Is she having a stroke?

608
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:20,448
I don't understand.

609
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:24,536
Unless this means that you've lost it
and I've got it again.

610
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,496
Well, step aside, Detective.

611
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,123
Niels, tell me.

612
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,960
What do you truly desire?

613
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,256
Is this the way you people solve crimes?

614
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,133
Hmm?

615
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:41,469
[Lucifer grunts]

616
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,056
[sighs]

617
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:47,517
Hi.

618
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,686
So Niels' alibi checked out.

619
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:52,230
Oh, so "arsehole," yes. "Murderer," no.

620
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:53,773
Well, there's another thing.

621
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,900
Remember Mario, Diane's vocal coach?

622
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,403
- Yes.
- Well, he called asking for an autograph.

623
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:01,114
Oh! Right. No problem.

624
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:06,327
What are you... No, no!
Not your autograph, mine.

625
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,414
- Turns out he's a <i>Hot Tub High School</i> fan.
- Oh.

626
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,583
Well, you see what that means, yes?

627
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,960
That he has excellent taste in movies?

628
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:17,297
No, Lucifer, he wasn't entranced
by my mojo.

629
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,174
He was just starstruck.

630
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,718
That's why it never worked
when I tried it on Niels.

631
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,595
I've never had mojo.

632
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:26,556
It worked on me. I felt it.

633
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,225
[sighs] Look, try it again.

634
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:30,727
Go on, look at me.

635
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,567
What do you desire?

636
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:38,984
I...

637
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:40,694
I...

638
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,198
want this to stop.

639
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,867
I can't bloody believe this.

640
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,912
I've never been more upset to be right.

641
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,789
Listen, Lucifer, I...

642
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,874
I'm sorry you're going through this,

643
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:56,044
but we are gonna figure this out together.

644
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:58,338
As a team.

645
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,674
Everything's gonna be okay, all right?
I promise.

646
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:18,565
[grunts]

647
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,610
[panicked breaths]

648
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,738
[whimpering]

649
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,323
Help!

650
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,120
[man] Are you okay?

651
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,664
Oh, thank God.

652
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,958
Please, you have to help me. I'm...

653
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,210
I don't know what happened, I just...

654
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:38,920
Thank you.

655
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,803
[gasping] No!

656
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,825
[police chatter on radio]

657
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,627
This scene's a carbon copy of Diane's.

658
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,005
Yeah. So is the body.

659
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,299
Same injection mark,

660
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,135
same binding technique,
same cause of death.

661
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,428
And no B&E.

662
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,762
Feels like a Hell loop.

663
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,598
We're dealing with a serial killer.

664
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,976
The flowers that we thought were Diane's,
I mean, this is his signature.

665
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,478
I should have known. I should have known.

666
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,398
The first crime scene was so clean.
It was too clean.

667
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,692
[splutters] It was so meticulously staged.

668
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:45,361
Don't beat yourself up, Ella.
It's not gonna do any good.

669
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,405
Who knows?
Maybe he made a mistake this time.

670
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:48,698
Yeah, I thought he had, too,

671
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:52,160
when I found this on her clothes,
but dead end.

672
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,871
Glitter's just an occupational hazard
for Madison.

673
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,081
Oh, no, she was a stripper.

674
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,583
No, elementary school teacher.

675
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:02,337
All the killer left behind
was stuff he wanted us to find.

676
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,798
Right. Well, white Stargazer lilies
are pretty rare,

677
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,800
so we can call local retailers,

678
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,845
have them let us know
of any sales in the last 24 hours.

679
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,056
We're looking for opportunity,
victim connections.

680
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,182
We'll build a profile.

681
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:18,227
This killer's MO is extremely unique.

682
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,896
Slashing vocal cords.

683
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,773
Why would anybody do that?

684
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:25,360
I don't know. Maybe, uh, he wanted
to take away their voice?

685
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,527
No.

686
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,284
He wants to take away their power.

687
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,664
<i>âª I'm bad as bad can be âª</i>

688
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:40,667
<i>âª So bad
That it's hard to believe âª</i>

689
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,087
<i>âª Oh what they say about me
I'm bad âª</i>

690
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:47,799
Okay, so my friend at the FBI
got a couple hits off of ViCAP.

691
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,386
Olivia Sacks, murdered in Phoenix,

692
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,429
last year 27, same MO.

693
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,681
Same signature.

694
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:55,764
Yeah.

695
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,184
This is Joy Goodman, 32.

696
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,936
She was reported missing three years ago,

697
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,939
but her body surfaced
in San Antonio last summer.

698
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,148
He dumped it?

699
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:08,277
So slashed vocal cords,
but no lilies found with the body.

700
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:10,041
That's why it was hard
to connect the dots,

701
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,906
too many differences
between the two scenes,

702
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,491
too much distance, too much time.

703
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,994
Now he has struck twice in the same city.

704
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,877
Yep, and he's picking up the pace.
His cooling-off period is shrinking.

705
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,331
We're gonna catch him, Decker.

706
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:26,170
Ella, why are you so optimistic
all of a sudden?

707
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,673
Well, I... I talked to Pete.

708
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:32,885
Yeah, and he said to stop focusing
on what I got wrong

709
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,388
and instead focus
on what I can still get right.

710
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:36,681
I can still help, Chloe.

711
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:39,284
I can still help catch this killer
before he hurts anybody else.

712
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,352
I'm just so glad
you found a good guy, Ella.

713
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,520
Yeah, me, too.

714
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:45,857
It's just really nice to have somebody
in your corner, you know?

715
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:49,193
I don't know, he just makes me feel
less powerless.

716
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,572
Cocozza told me to give you this.

717
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,908
Oh, great,
the leads from the flower shops.

718
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,660
Let's go follow up, shall we?

719
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,038
I could really use your help out there.

720
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,330
[chuckles]

721
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,542
- How can I refuse?
- [Chloe chuckles]

722
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,360
How many more of these to go, Detective?

723
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,930
I'm starting to think
our killer grows the flowers himself.

724
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,475
Well, this is the second-to-last shop
on the list,

725
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,143
- so fingers crossed.
- Hmm.

726
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:23,436
Uh, excuse me, Danilo?

727
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,979
I'm Detective Decker.

728
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,398
You called about a bouquet of lilies
you sold yesterday.

729
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:30,610
Yeah, I placed the call,
but it's my grandma who sold them.

730
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:33,333
- Great, can we speak with her?
- She doesn't really speak English.

731
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,156
Oh! Well, that's not a problem.

732
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,658
My wonderful partner here
speaks every language.

733
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,827
- I'm so lucky you're here.
- Mm-hmm.

734
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,330
[speaking Tagalog]

735
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,874
[speaking Tagalog]

736
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:47,418
But fair warning, she doesn't like cops.

737
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,545
- [blade slices loudly]
- Oh...

738
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,548
She's pretty mad that I called you guys.

739
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:53,883
Well, also not a problem.

740
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,635
- My partner is not a cop.
- No.

741
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,261
He has many connections,

742
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,473
he can grant favors,
and obviously is very charming.

743
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:03,684
- [chuckles]
- He's like my very own Swiss Army knife.

744
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,228
Would you please speak to the lady?

745
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,772
Well, after a buildup like that,
how could I refuse?

746
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:08,855
Thank you.

747
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,650
[speaking Tagalog]

748
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:15,029
[woman speaking Tagalog]

749
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,533
Excuse me, do you use that ribbon
on every bouquet?

750
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,243
Yep. Grandma insists on it.

751
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:23,996
It's the glitter.

752
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,080
Lucifer.

753
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,838
Uh... do you remember the golden glitter
that Ella found at the crime scene?

754
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:32,964
- Mm.
- Look at the ribbon.

755
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,882
Has to be our guy.

756
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,761
Right. Well, the lilies were bought
by a middle-aged man.

757
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,346
Unfortunately he paid in cash,

758
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,556
but my new friend,Â Jovita,

759
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,810
remembers the time he came in,
and that she saw him leave in an Uber.

760
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,520
Uber? Great.

761
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,063
Okay, we can track his ride, then.

762
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,443
<i>âª When it hurts âª</i>

763
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,989
<i>âª Just to breathe âª</i>

764
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,370
<i>âª Tell me something... âª</i>

765
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,705
Twenty-seven!

766
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,207
I'm surprised you're keeping track.

767
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,500
Humans count sheep,

768
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,585
I count shots.

769
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,670
And how many exactly before you, uh...

770
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,840
Before you tell me
what yesterday was all about?

771
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,425
Mm-mm.

772
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,636
Kind of trying to keep my mind
off things here.

773
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,763
Maze, if this is about...

774
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,473
This isn't about about Eve.

775
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,767
God, why does everyone keep thinking that?

776
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,644
Actually, I was going to say your mother.

777
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,606
Oh.

778
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,944
Well, I guess it is about her,

779
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:41,782
only because it was her stupid idea
to have soulless offspring...

780
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,327
making it her stupid fault

781
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,288
that I am doomed to be alone forever.

782
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,623
Eternal torture.

783
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:49,749
I see the irony.

784
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,041
Trust me.

785
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:55,504
So... yesterday, you were, what?

786
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:59,217
Trying to rekindle what we had?

787
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:11,187
Everyone's rejected me,Â Amenadiel.

788
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,898
But I was the one who rejected you.

789
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:17,026
So, I thought...

790
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,279
maybe that was a mistake.

791
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:22,948
Maybe...

792
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,118
Maybe only...

793
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,083
an angel could love a soulless demon.

794
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,296
You didn't reject me.

795
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:40,675
You...

796
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,263
You went to find your own path.

797
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:47,556
And you did.

798
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:50,725
You did.

799
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,896
And you've come such a long way, Maze.

800
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,691
Grown so much.

801
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,235
Apparently not enough.

802
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,739
Ever heard of a demon getting a soul?

803
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,533
I...

804
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,370
I can't say that I have.

805
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:13,666
But...

806
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:20,006
No one ever heard of an angel and a human
having a baby before.

807
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,592
Or of the Devil falling in love.

808
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:27,930
I don't know if a soul is what you need
to feel whole, but...

809
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,433
I do know this.

810
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:35,396
If anyone is going to find
what they're looking for,

811
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,523
it's you, Mazikeen.

812
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,368
[Maze] I'll still kick your ass, though.

813
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,452
I know.

814
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:01,339
[elevator dings]

815
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:04,884
Well, that bodes well.

816
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:08,054
Okay, so we're looking for a Les Klumpsky.

817
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,137
Gesundheit.

818
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,182
Sorry, it's just an unfortunate name.

819
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:14,518
Well, his Uber profile lists Unit 507
as his home.

820
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,937
You know, we wouldn't have gotten this
without you.

821
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,440
I see what you're doing, Detective,
and you can stop.

822
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:20,858
You don't need to flatter me.

823
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,753
- But, Lucifer...
- I know you're trying to help,

824
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,255
but I think this may be something
I need to sort out on my own.

825
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,822
That is what I desire.

826
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,784
Five-oh-seven. Shall we?

827
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:30,867
Hold on.

828
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,453
We got the warrant.

829
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,206
Go ahead. Let's get this bastard.

830
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,289
Right.

831
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,270
[Chloe] All clear.

832
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,493
His next victim.

833
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,663
And a receipt for flowers.

834
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,998
Purchased just a few hours ago.

835
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:19,833
[Chloe sighs]

836
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,296
He's gonna strike again.

837
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:26,298
Soon.

838
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,846
[Chloe] We have to ID her ASAP,

839
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:35,224
so I'm going to run this photo through
facial recognition, but it's a long shot.

840
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:36,747
Is there anything useful over there?

841
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:37,809
Nothing.

842
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,521
This monster's robbing people of
their lives, and there's nothing I can do.

843
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,108
Lucifer, you don't have to do this
on your own.

844
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,609
We're a team, you know?

845
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,738
When will Miss Lopez arrive, exactly?

846
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:53,075
She said they were close,
so any minute now.

847
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,159
"They"?

848
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,828
We're here! We're here.

849
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:58,539
I'm so sorry, we came
straight from the convention.

850
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,416
Uh, if there's... Thank you.

851
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,751
If there's anything I can do
to help, um...

852
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:05,880
Great, yes. We're on the clock,
so I'll take any help I can get.

853
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,174
Our killer is attacking women
in their homes.

854
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:10,384
And we think this might be
his next victim.

855
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,636
[Chloe] So if we're gonna get to her
before he does,

856
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,763
we have to figure out where she lives.

857
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,933
So just scour this place for any clues
you can find, okay? Let's go.

858
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,935
[Ella] Okay. Here.

859
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,312
- [Pete] Thanks.
- Sure.

860
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:22,729
Okay.

861
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,011
Pete, I found more pictures in here.
A lot more.

862
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,137
Come check it out.

863
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,986
- Hey, Pete, can you hand me my...
- Got you.

864
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:07,148
Thanks.

865
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:11,945
Okay.

866
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:17,076
I am so, so sorry for the weirdest...

867
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,371
darkest date ever.

868
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:21,454
Are you kidding me?

869
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,217
We're trying to save a life here.
This is...

870
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,290
Wait a second.

871
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,252
Is that...

872
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,923
Holy cow, Ells.

873
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,758
[both] I think we found something.

874
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,009
[Chloe] Coming.

875
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,844
- What'd you find?
- Check it out.

876
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:50,901
Chloe, I think that is his next victim.

877
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,695
Look at the wallpaper.

878
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:55,030
- And the carpet. Does it ring a bell?
- Ring a bell?

879
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,657
She lives in this apartment building.

880
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,325
[Chloe] On the ninth floor.

881
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,577
- Lucifer, let's go.
- Okay.

882
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,417
I'll take this way.

883
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,218
Hello?

884
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:21,640
Hi, uh, do you know this woman?
Does she live here?

885
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,310
Have you seen her around at all?

886
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:26,437
- Uh-uh.
- Okay, thanks.

887
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,481
Hello?

888
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,530
[door creaking open]

889
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:10,606

[grunts]

891
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:15,777
Gotcha.

892
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,658
[Lucifer cackles]

893
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:21,992
[man choking]

894
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:25,037
How does it feel to be powerless?

895
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:30,125
[Lucifer struggles for breath]

896
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,879
[both grunting]

897
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:37,925
[Lucifer strains]

898
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,930
Vocal cords are always
the first thing to seize up.

899
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:45,932
Don't feel bad.

900
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,560
Most would've dropped already.

901
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,397
You're clearly very strong.

902
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,316
I never was.

903
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:56,902
That's why they never listened.

904
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:58,277
[thud]

905
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,199
They have to listen now.

906
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:18,590
Lucifer!

907
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:24,888
Shh.

908
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:39,485
Lucifer.

909
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:40,611
Oh, my God.

910
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:43,782
What happened?

911
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,325
Are you okay?

912
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:47,619
Lucifer, what?

913
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:50,621
What...

914
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:54,877
- [man strains]
- [Chloe grunts]

915
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,045
[Chloe yells]

916
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:58,922
[both grunting]

917
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,090
LAPD!

918
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:05,846
[Chloe panting]

919
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,267
We got him.

920
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:14,730
We did it, Lucifer.

921
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,453
He admitted to all four murders.

922
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:31,537
Coward.

923
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,752
Pete, I'm really sorry
you had to see this.

924
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:38,712
I just wish I didn't
have to write about him.

925
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:39,796
The killer?

926
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:45,385
[sighs] My editor has already come up
with a catchy nickname for him.

927
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:49,348
Apparently after your vocal cords have
been cut, you're still able to whisper,

928
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:52,100
so she wants to call him
the Whisper Killer.

929
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:54,353
Certainly more sinisterÂ than
"Les Klumpsky."

930
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:57,231
I-I just hate contributing
to the kind of BS

931
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:58,607
that feeds these guys' egos.

932
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,443
Hey, you know what? This is your piece.

933
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:04,321
You write this however you want.

934
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,780
You got this.

935
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:10,035
Hey, Decker, will you sign off
on these evidence logs?

936
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:11,161
- Of course.
- Thanks.

937
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,169
You... You don't...

938
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:22,047
You don't seem to like me very much.

939
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,006
It's all good.

940
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,050
I don't want you to think I'm needy.

941
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:27,344
It's just, Ella really likes you.

942
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:30,639
And I like her.

943
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:34,393
In a... In a very different way,
obviously, you know.

944
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:38,981
Okay, well, what I'm trying to say is
I would like it if we could get along.

945
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:42,693
So if I did anything wrong, just tell me.

946
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:43,776
Wrong?

947
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:45,320
On the contrary...

948
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,282
it appears that
you're doing everything right,

949
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,325
at least, when it comes to Miss Lopez.

950
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:55,956
I guess we made a pretty good team today.

951
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,039
Well, there's that,

952
00:47:57,082 --> 00:48:01,920
and the fact that you enjoy sharing,
which boggles the mind.

953
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:04,423
Besides, it appears that you...

954
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,717
empower each other.

955
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,594
Yeah, it's...

956
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:10,971
kind of scary.

957
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:11,889
Scary?

958
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,140
Yeah, 'cause, like...

959
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:17,185
You ever get the feeling
you're not good enough for someone?

960
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:20,022
- [scoffs]
- Okay, I guess a guy like you wouldn't.

961
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:22,858
But for me, I'm terrified.

962
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:26,987
But I just figured,
deciding if I'm good enough or not,

963
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:29,072
that's not up to me.

964
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,366
I mean, that's up to her.

965
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,494
So, all I can do is

966
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:37,456
open up and let her in,

967
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:40,042
and then she can judge for herself.

968
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:42,627
Right?

969
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:44,795
Right.

970
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:51,970
Okay, fingers crossed
he sleeps through the night, again.

971
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:56,266
Um, there's lasagna leftovers
in the fridge if you get peckish.

972
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,350
Nice.

973
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:58,893
Thank you.

974
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:00,938
No, thank <i>you.</i>

975
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:03,023
Don't you miss cocktails?

976
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:04,690
Grown-ups?

977
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,360
Actual conversation?

978
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:09,279
Cocktails?

979
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:11,323
I was just drinking with Maze,

980
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:14,868
so I've had enough booze
for the next several months.

981
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,161
[both chuckling]

982
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:17,537
I know what you mean.

983
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,790
How is Maze?
I know she's been going through a lot.

984
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:20,873
She, um...

985
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,669
She picked a fight with me for no reason.

986
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:26,129
And she kissed me.

987
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,756
We almost had sex...

988
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:28,840
I think.

989
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:29,924
You what?

990
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:31,969
You know Maze.

991
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,887
She thought she needed to fight.

992
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,180
Or a different F-word.

993
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:38,600
It turns out she just needed
someone to talk to.

994
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,310
Well, you're such a good friend.

995
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,145
Such a good dad.

996
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:45,023
You, sir,

997
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,484
have got this caretaker thing down.

998
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,141
You know what I've been thinking?

999
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:55,951
Maybe it's okay that I don't really have
much of a life

1000
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:57,494
outside of Charlie right now.

1001
00:49:57,577 --> 00:49:59,079
He really needs me, and...

1002
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:01,665
being a dad, it's...

1003
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:04,960
It's the only thing I need.

1004
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:06,753
And that's not unhealthy.

1005
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,382
- Is it?
- No.

1006
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:12,300
No, of course not.

1007
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:14,428
By all means,

1008
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:17,639
enjoy this phase while it lasts.

1009
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:20,767
While it lasts?

1010
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,311
No, I just mean
if you and I do a good job,

1011
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:25,731
Charlie's gonna need us
less and less every day, you know?

1012
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,440
Okay, I'm off.

1013
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,110
Have a good night!

1014
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,528
Thank you!

Detective!

1018
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:52,465
Oh, hi.

1019
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:55,302
- What are you doing here?
- I'm just going over this case.

1020
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:58,638
There's something about it
that's bothering me.

1021
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,933
It's probably nothing, but you know me,
just gotta make sure.

1022
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:03,017
Of course.

1023
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,163
Just to be clear,
I wasn't asking <i>what </i>you were doing,

1024
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:07,272
just why you were doing it here.

1025
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:08,607
Not that I'm complaining.

1026
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,358
This desk has never looked so good.

1027
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,442
[chuckles]

1028
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:16,031
Well, I thought that maybe
this could be our new normal.

1029
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:18,116
I mean, if... if you like it.

1030
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,203
Well, you work and I drink,
what's not to like about that?

1031
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:23,330
Especially...

1032
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,999
if you take a break every once in a while.

1033
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,626
It's a lovely evening outside.

1034
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:42,766
Because you're vulnerable around me...

1035
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:46,520
I sometimes forget how strong you are.

1036
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:48,646
How powerful.

1037
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,608
Less and less, as you're well aware.

1038
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:54,778
Feeling human...

1039
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:59,282
feeling weak,
having to rely on other people,

1040
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,535
it must be so hard, so...

1041
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:02,994
scary for you.

1042
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:04,079
[scoffs]

1043
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,623
I suppose what I call powerlessness

1044
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:08,834
is what everyone else calls a Tuesday.

1045
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,252
[both chuckle]

1046
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:14,172
Lucifer, I understand why you're so upset.

1047
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:15,382
You lost your mojo.

1048
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,050
Of course it's a bad thing.

1049
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:19,511
But I just wonder if it could also

1050
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:20,679
be a good thing.

1051
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:22,347
[laughs] Wha...

1052
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,182
Now you're just spewing nonsense.

1053
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:27,394
I-I've been thinking,
and the fact that I can mojo you...

1054
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,772
maybe it means that I've just put a...

1055
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:36,361
tiny dent in the giant wall
that you've erected around yourself.

1056
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:42,200
I think, perhaps, for the first time ever,

1057
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:44,077
you're starting to open up to me...

1058
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,162
to let me in.

1059
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:50,624
Quite right.

1060
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,045
I think I may have dropped my guard.

1064
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,142
I'm gonna go freshen up.

1065
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:08,310
I'll be right back.
