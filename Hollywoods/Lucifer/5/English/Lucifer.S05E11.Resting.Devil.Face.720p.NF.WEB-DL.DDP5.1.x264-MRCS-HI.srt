- [woman] Hi.
- Hi, there. Uh...

Have you seen

quite the fight. Did you get an ID?

00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,635
Clemson goes down on the canvas.
It's a knockout. The crowd goes wild!

173
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:31,552
Wild!

174
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,055
Time out, crime scene. Right.

175
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:37,308
Sorry, but just to be clear,
none of that jogged your memory?

176
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,435
No.

177
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,813
Chloe, he was a huge sensation. Look.

178
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,690
[Chloe sighs] Oh.

179
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,944
Are you sure this is the same guy?

180
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,196
Well, he's fallen upon
tough times recently.

181
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,990
He had a heart attack
a few years ago that ended his career.

182
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,326
I know, always thought
he'd make a comeback.

183
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,495
Instead, he got the final TKO.

184
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:01,040
Oh, I don't bloody believe this!

185
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,251
I mean, the guy was...

186
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,253
- Of course!
- [softly] That's my son.

187
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:09,173
Of course you're still here, selfishly
putting all of humanity in danger.

188
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,466
That's where you're wrong.

189
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,678
My divine presence
won't be a danger to anyone because...

190
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,305
I made myself human.

191
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,235
What do you mean
you've made yourself human?

192
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,279
You were worried
about my powers glitching.

193
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,197
So I put them aside, temporarily.

194
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,281
Check it out.

195
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,036
Your old man is just a regular dude.

196
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,121
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

197
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:43,791
And why would you think it's a good idea
to become a "regular dude"?

198
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,794
When we were singing together,
I realized you were right.

199
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:47,753
[chuckles]

200
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:51,841
Sorry, could you repeat that? I would
love to capture the moment for posterity.

201
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,260
I tried to be supportive.

202
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,679
But how can I,

203
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,056
if I never truly understood you?

204
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,808
So I'm going to try.

205
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,893
Starting right here, right now.

206
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,104
Here and now, at my job?

207
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:08,858
Well, you've clearly learned and grown
a great deal in your time on Earth.

208
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,985
I'd just like to be
a party to that knowledge.

209
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,322
Living in a human form. Solving cases.

210
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:17,491
I'm here for the whole kit and kaboodle.

211
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,830
- Oh, uh, Lucifer, you still there?
- Regretfully, yes.

212
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,333
Wow!

213
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,587
Did you know that when humans
close their eyes they can't see anything?

214
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,380
- I did.
- [God] I mean, total darkness.

215
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,944
But you open these babies and bam!
Let there be light. [laughs]

216
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,551
- [Chloe] Hey.
- Oh, Detective.

217
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,762
Please tell me there's
some pressing break in the case

218
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,181
we must investigate right this minute.

219
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,684
Well, actually, now that
your dad is here, maybe he can help.

220
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:48,105
So, you are all-seeing
and all-knowing, yes?

221
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,566
So, whodunnit? [scoffs]

222
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,571
For once, I actually don't know.

223
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,074
I made myself human.

224
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,077
Isn't that exciting? [laughs]

225
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,997
What is he talking about?

226
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,833
Oh, he does inexplicable things
from time to time.

227
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,961
Marsupials, pomegranates,
the gall bladder.

228
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:14,548
Anyway, we've got a murder to solve,
so what say we regroup at the precinct?

229
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,883
Just us crime solvers.

230
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,927
Well, we can't just leave him here.

231
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,680
[sighs] Fine. I'll call him an Uber.

232
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,933
No. Would you like to come back with us?

233
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,102
Oh, that sounds divine, Detective.

234
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:30,356
We can do all the things you kids
normally do, but together, with me.

235
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,273
[Lucifer grunts]

236
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:35,111
- [Ella] Oh, that's gotta hurt!
- [grunting and groaning on screen]

237
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,618
[slurping]

238
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,995
Oh, I'm sorry, but it's so delicious.

239
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,373
It's like snow, with fruit.

240
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:51,419
- [Chloe] Hmm.
- Hi. Oh, are you the new lab tech?

241
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,878
Oh, that's right, you haven't met.

242
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,047
Miss Lopez, this is my father.

243
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,632
Dad, Miss Lopez.

244
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,634
- Your dad?
- [Lucifer] Hmm.

245
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:03,139
- Oh, my God! It's so amazing to meet you.
- Oh, you too!

246
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,515
[laughs]

247
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:07,143
And I just wanna thank you
for all the support.

248
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,061
It hasn't gone unnoticed.

249
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,105
Anyway, can't believe I'm saying this,

250
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,524
but can we all just,
you know, focus on the case?

251
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,609
- [Chloe] Mm-hmm.
- [Lucifer clears throat]

252
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,319
[slurps] Oh!

253
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,281
My head is on fire!

254
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,240
Brain freeze.

255
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:24,452
We've all been there, big guy.
Just give it a second, it'll go away.

256
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,997
Hmm. Yes, so,
why was Almighty breaking into a...

257
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,000
[groans] Oh! There it is again.

258
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,001
Put that down.

259
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:35,921
What was Almighty doing
breaking into a hospital?

260
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,424
- Well, the Internet's best guess is drugs.
- Oh.

261
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,634
Check out the pharmacy in the background.

262
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,429
Anything in his tox screen?

263
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,015
Yeah. A boatload
of the drug that killed him.

264
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,559
Some sort of synthetic stimulant.

265
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:52,146
But it's weird 'cause the chemical formula
doesn't fit anything in our database.

266
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,857
Right. Let's go to the hospital,
see if anyone knows more.

267
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,193
[clears throat] Right. Right.

268
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,196
- Oh, my.
- Stop drinking it so fast.

269
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,113
It's not that.

270
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:05,117
- I think I need to... you know.
- [Lucifer] Oh.

271
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,745
Ugh. Excuse us
for just one moment, Detective.

272
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,498
It appears I need
to take my billion-year-old father

273
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,541
to the little boys' room. Come on.

274
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,627
[liquid tinkling]

275
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,425
It's cool, man. You're still in one piece.

276
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,179
God is not gonna kill you.

277
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:30,392
He'll just wait
till you die and torture you.

278
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,561
For all eternity.

279
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:37,316
[sighing]

280
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:43,197
I am breathing healing energy.

281
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,282
[inhales, exhales]

282
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:48,035
[screams, gasps] Maze!

283
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,871
I see you're handling
this celestial stuff like a champ.

284
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,124
Well, at least your psycho behavior
finally makes sense.

285
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,126
- Hmm.
- I mean, you're a...

286
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,214
You're a demon.

287
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,298
Yeah.

288
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:05,718
What's Hell like?

289
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,304
Oh, Hell is awesome.

290
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,850
- Really?
- Yeah.

291
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,477
[sighs] That's a relief.

292
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:18,065
The pain, torture,
the screams of doomed souls,

293
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:22,403
begging for the sweet release
of a death that will never come.

294
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,156
[laughs, exhales]

295
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,451
Oh, you mean for you.

296
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,288
Yeah, Hell's gonna suck, bro.

297
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,873
[Dan chuckles]

298
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,792
Anyway, at least you have a soul to damn.

299
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:37,960
Unlike me.

300
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,172
[gasps]

301
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,966
Thanks for the reminder, Dan.

302
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,343
[gasps]

303
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,854
Yes, Albert Walcott was my patient.

304
00:14:56,937 --> 00:15:00,566
He suffered a cardiac event
in his dressing room after a match.

305
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,649
[God] No.

306
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,361
I'm sorry, this is just so exciting.

307
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,989
I have literally no idea
what she's gonna say next.

308
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:07,948
You were saying.

309
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:11,035
[doctor] Well, the medics
had the sense to rush him to the ER,

310
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,746
and I was able
to save his life with a triple bypass.

311
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,789
It must have been difficult for Almighty.

312
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,792
Losing the abilities
that once made him invincible.

313
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,295
You know, I think it was, actually.

314
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:24,506
He fell into a depression and stopped
showing up for his appointments.

315
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,717
In fact, the last time
any of us here saw him,

316
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,345
he was caught trying to steal drugs.

317
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,971
So the Internet was right.

318
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:34,767
Mr. Walcott is lucky that the hospital
administration didn't press charges.

319
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,228
I guess they figured that video
going viral was punishment enough.

320
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,897
So we found this in his tox screen.

321
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,191
It's a drug our forensics team
didn't recognize.

322
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,610
Have you seen anything like that before?

323
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,487
Yes, unfortunately I have.

324
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,281
This is a drug
that was developed for fighter pilots.

325
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,700
It's colloquially known as YSD.

326
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:55,746
It's very exclusive, although we have
seen a couple of overdoses in the ER.

327
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,414
Exclusive, you say?

328
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,458
Can you tell me what this drug looks like?

329
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,085
I've only seen it in person once.

330
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,797
I found a pill in the pocket
of a DOA, but as memory serves,

331
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,341
it was, uh...

332
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,884
small and pink.

333
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,012
Right, what shade of pink, precisely?

334
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,932
Bubble gum, Barbie or bougainvillea?

335
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,184
Or sunset, cherry blossom.

336
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,435
Flamingo.

337
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,479
I did outdo myself with the colors.

338
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,147
Uh...

339
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,608
Well, I guess
you could say ballet slipper.

340
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,652
Oh, say no more.

341
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,655
That's the pill. Wh...

342
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:30,948
How did you acquire that?

343
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,992
Thank you, Dr. Porter,
you've been very helpful.

344
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,827
- Yes, thank you.
- Lucifer.

345
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,870
- [God] Thank you.
- Where did you get that?

346
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,081
At Lux, of course.
And the doctor was right.

347
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,375
It's very high-end
and not at all easy to come by.

348
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,712
There's only one dealer who carries
them in town at present. The Colonel.

349
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,131
Drinks like a fish, surprisingly charming.

350
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,590
Reminds me of a young me.

351
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:52,386
Let's arrange a buy, we'll set up a sting,
and we'll shake down this Colonel.

352
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,971
A sting.

353
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,139
How exciting!

354
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,558
What should I wear? How should I speak?

355
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:01,311
I always thought
this pip-pip-cheerio accent that you chose

356
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,314
was a little over the top,
but maybe I'll give it a try.

357
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,858
You won't be trying anything.

358
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,235
We're dropping you off
at the penthouse on the way.

359
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,822
As the Spanish like to say, <i>vaya con...</i> you.

360
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,491
<i>♪ Na-na-na-na-na-na-na ♪</i>

361
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,076
<i>♪ I'm a dangerous man ♪</i>

362
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,038
<i>- ♪ Na-na-na-na-na-na-na ♪
- ♪ Yeah! ♪</i>

363
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,707
<i>- ♪ Na-na-na-na-na-na-na ♪
- ♪ I'm a dangerous man... ♪</i>

364
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,584
Okay, the perimeter's set.

365
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,337
Our guy's all mic-ed up,
and he's heading into the buy.

366
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,132
- Right.
- And by "our guy," I mean Lucifer.

367
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,341
The Devil.

368
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,801
Who we work with.

369
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,512
[sighs] Are you sure
we should send him in there alone?

370
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:39,975
Well, Lucifer's invincible now,
so what could go wrong?

371
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,394
<i>♪ I'm a dangerous man ♪</i>

372
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,438
<i>♪ Na-na-na-na-na-na-na ♪</i>

373
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,814
[woman] Lucifer!

374
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,066
Colonel!

375
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,233
Nice to see you.

376
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,986
We were just getting
to know your charming associate.

377
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,537
Dad.

378
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:06,960
<i>- ♪ Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho! ♪
- ♪ 'Cause I'm a dangerous man ♪</i>

379
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,545
[Lucifer sighs]

380
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:12,925
Excuse us a moment, just need
a word with my associate. [chuckles]

381
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,968
What are you doing here?

382
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,887
If I truly want to understand you,

383
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,766
I have to experience
the full breadth of earthly existence.

384
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,102
- Hmm.
- Risk, danger.

385
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,688
You're about to be experiencing death
if you blow our cover.

386
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,650
To the man behind the man.

387
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,985
The man behind the man? [laughs]

388
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,029
- Is that what you told them?
- [chuckles]

389
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,449
Well, actually, son,
I'm the man behind all men. And women.

390
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,533
Son?

391
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,953
You're Lucifer's father?

392
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,412
Did I fail to mention that?

393
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,959
- Must have slipped my mind.
- The apple fell a ways from the tree.

394
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,752
- Oh, yeah, I like that.
- [chuckles]

395
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,632
Lucifer, I see where you get your
business acumen and your charm.

396
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,801
[laughs] Oh, wrong on both counts.

397
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,887
- He just gave me Hell, but no matter.
- [laughs]

398
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,807
Right, here's your money.
Please hand over the drugs.

399
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,434
[colonel] Stolz, go get the product.

400
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,688
Well, that could have gone worse, huh?

401
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,152
How do you think
this Colonel O'Bryan is doing?

402
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,736
From a moral standpoint?

403
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,031
Well, she's a drug dealer

404
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:21,910
and most likely a murderer,
so probably not so great.

405
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,830
Yeah, that's what I thought.

406
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,624
Maybe military school isn't the answer.

407
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:29,876
For Trixie.

408
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,130
To get her back
on the straight and narrow before she...

409
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,883
ends up... you know?

410
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,554
Dan, you think
our 11-year-old daughter is going to Hell?

411
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,513
I don't know.

412
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,933
I mean, maybe.

413
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,436
Aren't you afraid of it?
I mean, it's all real, Chloe.

414
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,855
God. The Devil.
It's real, you know? I just, I...

415
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,442
I wanna nudge Trixie in
the right direction before it's too late.

416
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,486
Okay, yeah, yes, uh, Hell does exist,

417
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,531
I just don't think one school suspension
is the road to ruin here.

418
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:03,744
You'd be surprised
how easy it is to get on the wrong track.

419
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,246
Dan.

420
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,250
You are a great dad.

421
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,337
Trixie's a great kid.

422
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,131
She's just having a tween moment.

423
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,592
I'm sure she's talking
about it to Linda now.

424
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,764
That bully must have
done something pretty bad

425
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,683
for you to feel
that you needed to lock him up.

426
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,605
That's what you're going with?

427
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:34,107
No wonder Lucifer's still in therapy.

428
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:37,736
Oh, and B-T-dubs, you can't trick me
into talking about my feelings.

429
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:40,905
Wow.

430
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,244
Okay, well,
you're very perceptive, Trixie, you know?

431
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,954
But I don't <i>have to</i> trick you.

432
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,415
See, a therapist is
kind of like a detective.

433
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,251
I can just look at your actions

434
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,670
and figure out how
you're feeling from there.

435
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,924
Like for example, sometimes when
we're really upset with someone we love,

436
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,134
we can get scared
of expressing that feeling

437
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:04,096
or even admitting it to ourselves.

438
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,265
It's called denial.

439
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,850
Denial makes my stomach hurt?

440
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:14,022
The thing is, when we try
to stuff those feelings down too far,

441
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,817
we may wind up
lashing out at someone else.

442
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,611
Someone who isn't even important to us.

443
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,864
Like Todd Drexhage.

444
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:23,948
Exactly.

445
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,619
So if I did have denial,

446
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,871
how would I cure it?

447
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,873
Well, if I were you,

448
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,295
I might try to be my own detective.

449
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,173
I'd look deep down inside my heart

450
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,802
to find out who I was <i>really</i> mad at.

451
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,431
And then
I'd tell that person how I was feeling.

452
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,685
Even if it might hurt them?

453
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,395
Even if it might hurt them.

454
00:21:56,064 --> 00:22:00,152
Mid temper-tantrum, Lucifer looks
straight up at me, all serious, and says,

455
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,237
"I'm going to start a rebellion."

456
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,905
- Adorable.
- [men chuckle]

457
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,657
You're lucky your dad is here.

458
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,577
Am I? [laughs]

459
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,620
I was top of my class at the Academy.

460
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:14,082
- Earned a Silver Star in Afghanistan.
- Hmm.

461
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,668
And I built a small business
from the ground up.

462
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:21,048
You know how underrepresented women are
in the upper echelons of the drug trade?

463
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,215
I am a trailblazer.

464
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,551
- None of it's good enough for my mother.
- [sighs]

465
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:27,054
You should be grateful
your dad is so supportive.

466
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:30,390
My father is about as supportive
as a piece of wet cardboard.

467
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:34,144
[God laughs]
I never had to support you, son.

468
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:37,898
You know,
he moved to Los Angeles all by himself,

469
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,983
established a thriving nightclub.

470
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,861
- And now he's a consultant for the LA...
- Dad!

471
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,865
Oh, don't be so modest, son.
Look how well you're handling this sting.

472
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,033
[mumbles]

473
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,034
Say again?

474
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,079
[Lucifer sighs]

475
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,040
Whoops.

476
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,792
[huffs]

477
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,460
[sighs]

478
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,506
Look, look,
everything is gonna be okay, right?

479
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,800
Lucifer can flatten bullets, and God...

480
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:07,301
well, he's God.

481
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,261
Yeah.

482
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,516
- Not anymore.
- [O'Bryan] <i>Pack up the product!</i>

483
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,434
We're moving base camp now.

484
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,145
We'll take care of these two on the way.

485
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:21,608
[exhales] All right, Dad,
time to get your powers back.

486
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,318
God up, as it were.

487
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,321
Unfortunately,
I don't have my powers with me right now.

488
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,782
But I'm sure
everything will turn out just fine.

489
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,576
That's what you said
about the bloody dinosaurs!

490
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,537
Don't you <i>dare</i> take that tone with me!

491
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,623
I giveth,
and I'm not afraid to taketh away.

492
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:40,419
Oh, a lot of big words for a man who was
recently leveled by a frozen beverage!

493
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,421
- [O'Bryan] Quiet, you two!
<i>- </i>Sorry!

494
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,257
[Lucifer scoffs]

495
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,467
- [O'Bryan] Come on. Hurry.
- [God] Lucifer.

496
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:50,887
As I stare down at that weapon,
I'm feeling something entirely new.

497
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,598
Regretful, ridiculous, ready to go home?

498
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,810
No, no, no, my forehead is wet,
but my throat is dry,

499
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,395
and the floor's starting to spin.

500
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,564
Lucifer, is the floor
starting to spin for you?

501
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:02,274
- Dad.
- Listen, shut up!

502
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,488
Ow!

503
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,949
[Lucifer panting] Yes.

504
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,494
I'm starting to feel something as well.

505
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,331
[growls]

506
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,792
[scraping]

507
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:24,087
- [screaming]
- [loud banging]

508
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,007
[Chloe panting] Wait.

509
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,135
- [blows landing]
- [grunting]

510
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:32,220
[heart beating]

[man screams]

512
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,939
No one lays hands on my father.

513
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,859
Put the human down, Samael.

514
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,073
There's no need for violence.

515
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,037
[Lucifer] Dad.

516
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,956
They were going to kill you. [huffs]

517
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,379
- They were, weren't they?
- [Lucifer sighs]

518
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,008
[Chloe panting] Oh, Lucifer. Are you okay?

519
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,051
Are they okay?

520
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:13,845
What happened?

521
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:18,308
Oh, just prevented GI Jane here
from pulling a Nietzsche.

522
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:21,394
Anyway, I'm sure
you can take it from here.

523
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:22,604
If you'll excuse us,

524
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,065
Dad and I have an errand to attend to.

525
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,317
Come on!

526
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,820
[groans] Ow! Where are we going?

527
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,822
Hurts to talk
with a busted lip, doesn't it?

528
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,659
The good news is
you can poof the pain away yourself

529
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,787
because we are getting your powers
back right now. Where are they?

530
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:42,958
I don't remember.

531
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,085
Uh...

532
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,302
Drink this, it'll help.

533
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:05,355
- Oh!
- Yes. Right, now focus.

534
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,482
Where are your powers?

535
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,900
I really don't remember.

536
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,069
But I'm sure I left them somewhere safe.

537
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:14,364
If you don't remember where they are,
how can you be sure that they're safe?

538
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,408
What if something happens to them?

539
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,201
What if something happens to you?

540
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,495
Does the universe
collapse into nothingness,

541
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,623
destroying everything
and everyone I care about?

542
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,459
Your face, Lucifer.

543
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,088
The one you used in Hell.

544
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:33,049
In person, it really is quite intense.

545
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:39,723
Are you seriously about to critique
the way I looked while saving your life?

546
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:43,143
Because if so,
pardon my resting devil face.

547
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,814
Why did you choose that face?

548
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,152
Deep down,
that face is how you see yourself.

549
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,114
[elevator bell dings]

550
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,617
[Lucifer] What are you doing here?

551
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,500
I told my dad
I forgot my social studies book.

552
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,037
- [sighs]
- He's waiting downstairs.

553
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,247
Very well,
fetch the book and be on your way.

554
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,042
I lied, dummy.

555
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,546
What on earth was that for?

556
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,840
I looked
inside my heart like Dr. Linda said,

557
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,300
and here's what I realized.

558
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:18,094
Your hair is stupid,
and your jokes are immature,

559
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,972
and what kind of person
puts a bar that big in their house?

560
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,850
My hair is majestic, and you know it.

561
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,978
- Grown-ups are supposed to be responsible.
- Oh, are they?

562
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,773
Well, I'll show you responsibility.

563
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:32,359
You're banned
from the penthouse for a month. [chuckles]

564
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:38,281
Come on, Dad, we are returning
this miniature hooligan to her father.

00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,375

<i>♪ Don't try to break me, don't try ♪</i>

569
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:58,093
The most you have me on
is possession of a drug

570
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,053
that hasn't even been made illegal yet.

571
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,846
You'll be lucky to keep me overnight.

572
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,849
Well, I wouldn't worry
about the possession charge, Colonel.

573
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,352
We have you on the hook
for good old-fashioned murder.

574
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:11,731
So Albert "Almighty" Walcott
was injected with YSD against his will

575
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,943
and seeing that
you're the only YSD dealer in town,

576
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:18,363
I figure it was either you that
killed him or the person you sold to.

577
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,536
Detective,
I've done three tours in Afghanistan.

578
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,955
I led my men
through horrors you can't imagine

579
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,416
and dragged them out
to the other side alive.

580
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:32,502
I wasn't scared
when your partner choked me unconscious,

581
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:36,631
and I sure as hell am not scared
of your half-baked accusations.

582
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,717
[clicks tongue]

583
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,596
It says, uh, you are
second-generation military.

584
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,433
Yeah? Your mom was a four-star general,

585
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,769
who went on to a distinguished career
in the State Department.

586
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:50,853
Very impressive.

587
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:51,813
What's your point?

588
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,815
Well, I bet she'd be real disappointed

589
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,734
to see her legacy going up in smoke.

590
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,360
Trust me, she wouldn't care.

591
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:01,030
Well, being a mother myself,
I have to disagree.

592
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:04,409
Children, they are
a reflection of us, aren't they?

593
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:09,372
But why don't we call General Mom
and see what she thinks?

00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,643
Did you display anger issues as a child?

Uh, vigilante behavior,
locking anyone to a lunch table?

601

Hang up the phone. I... [groans lightly]

602
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:41,279

who gave Almighty the YSD.

- Oh.
- [ringing stops]

604
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:47,452
I sold a bunch

Dude calls himself
"fitness guru to the stars."

00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,376
Damn right I did.

685
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,670
You know who doesn't need babysitting?

686
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:09,964
This guy.

687
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,676
You glue his little feet
to the deck one time,

688
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,722
and he sails on forever
without a single complaint.

689
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:19,432
Right.

690
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:22,852
Absolutely, but what does
any of this have to do with YSD?

691
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,396
The drug helps my clients focus.

692
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:29,817
Better coordination,
fewer late night calls.

693
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,487
I know it's safe because I take it myself.

694
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,281
Steadies the hands.

695
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,408
Yes, but it isn't safe for everybody.

696
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,702
Did you know about
Almighty's heart condition

697
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,329
when you gave him the YSD?

698
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,165
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I've never given Almighty any drug.

699
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:47,168
[huffs] And he wouldn't
even have taken it if I had.

700
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,170
His body was a temple.

701
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,006
No alcohol, no coffee,
not so much as an aspirin.

702
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,885
Anyone who says otherwise is a liar.

703
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:57,428
Right.

704
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:00,389
Well, good luck with the armada.

705
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:11,317
Hold on. What if, when Almighty broke into
the hospital, he wasn't looking for drugs?

706
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,443
Look at this.

707
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:16,114
There's two doors in the hallway,
right where he got caught breaking in.

708
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,366
So, the one on the left is the pharmacy.

709
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,868
The one at the end of the hall is...

710
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,203
Records room.

711
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,121
Yes.

712
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:26,165
If Almighty was digging
through private medical records...

713
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,543
Maybe he found
something worth killing for.

714
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,670
We have to get back
to the hospital. Let's go.

715
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,172
Oh! Oh.

716
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:36,342
I'm afraid I won't be able to come.
[chuckling]

717
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:40,555
It appears that my father
has gone missing. [chuckles]

718
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,098
God has gone missing?

719
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:45,560
No, I'm sure it'll be fine. He's probably
gone to that doughnut shop he likes

720
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,646
or decided to relive
the glory days of creation at the zoo.

721
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,815
Anyway, you go on with the case,

722
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:53,985
and I'll pop off, try and find him
and give him a stern talking-to.

723
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:56,070
- Right. Okay.
- Uh...

724
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,823
- Mm.
- Oh.

725
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,784
I'm sorry, I just...

726
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,452
I didn't know where we stood after...

727
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:06,998
Oh, no, I shouldn't have.
I wasn't thinking. I mean...

728
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,291
I'm the one who couldn't...

729
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:11,544
- No. No, oh, my God. No. I...
- [sighs]

730
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:13,129
- Mm!
- Oh!

731
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,212
Sorry.

732
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,966
- Oh, no, no. It's all good.
- Good.

733
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,302
- Uh...
- Yes.

734
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,340
[exhales]

735
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,930
[chuckling] Well, what a lovely surprise.

736
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,390
Are you running away too?

737
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:13,064
Batten down the hatches
and crank up the Vivaldi, huh?

738
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,441
- It's a beautiful day to operate.
- [chuckles]

739
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,524
Scalpel.

740
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:25,909
[Chloe] Dr. Porter.

741
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:31,082
[Porter] I'm about to perform
an extremely delicate surgery, Detective.

742
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:32,875
If you'd like to make an appointment,

743
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,378
I'm sure my nurse
can squeeze you in tomorrow.

744
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,672
Almighty didn't come here
looking for drugs, did he?

745
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:42,468
He came here looking for records,
your records, and I saw them.

746
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,929
They confirmed
what Almighty thought all along.

747
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:47,807
That you had botched other surgeries
just like you botched his.

748
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,936
He threatened to expose you. Didn't he?

749
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,688
So you killed him with an overdose.

750
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:58,109
YSD, the exact drug that you use
to steady the tremor in your hands.

751
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:01,445
No, Albert Walcott
was a deranged, deluded addict.

752
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,781
He was! We all saw that video.

753
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:06,617
[Chloe] I know what it's like
to have people depending on you.

754
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:09,745
To feel like you always
have to be the strong one

755
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,872
or else everything will fall apart.

756
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:18,671
The YSD, it...
it helps you conceal your weakness,

757
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:22,049
but it's just a Band-Aid. You...

758
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,635
you're not okay, Doctor.

759
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:29,932
And pretending that you are is only
hurting the ones that depend on you.

760
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,895
You can still save
one last patient, Doctor.

761
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,148
All you have to do is...

762
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,026
just put down the scalpel.

763
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,113
Please put it down.

764
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:10,972
Oh, thank you.

765
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,437
[chuckles] Enjoy.

766
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,069
So, why are you running away?

767
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,363
I've been having...

768
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,198
trouble lately.

769
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,285
I haven't been feeling like myself.

770
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:33,913
Getting confused, losing things.

771
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,582
And now my children are mad at me.

772
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,459
Can't say I blame them.

773
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:43,339
Honestly,
I think I may have really messed up.

774
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,052
I guess everyone makes mistakes.

775
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,388
Even grown-ups.

776
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,056
What a wise observation.

777
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,557
What about you, Trixie?

778
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,185
What are you doing so far from home?

779
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,398
I realized I'm mad at Lucifer.

780
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:07,029
I've actually been mad
at him for a while, but I had denial.

781
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,573
Happens to the best of us.

782
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:13,828
Why are you mad at him?

783
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,206
Well, I... I thought we were friends...

784
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,418
but then he just ran off
to Florida for months,

785
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,919
and he didn't even say goodbye.

786
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,381
He always just does whatever he wants.

787
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,675
And now...

788
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,970
I don't know what he's doing now.

789
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:35,266
But I know it's making my mom really sad.

790
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,938
You know I'm Lucifer's dad, right?

791
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:45,693
Well, some of the ways he acts...

792
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,154
I think they may be my fault.

793
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:54,034
As a father, I tried to give my children
just the right amount of free will...

794
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:59,457
the right amount
of responsibility, consequence.

795
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:04,295
Looking back at how I raised Lucifer...

796
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:10,551
Hmm, I'm not sure I got it all right.

797
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,472
I've never been a parent before,

798
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,016
but it seems like a tough job.

799
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,602
Hmm. I've never been a kid.

800
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:25,191
- But I bet that's not so easy either.
- [both chuckle]

801
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,945
[both laugh]

802
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,295
I think it's time to go home.

803
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:48,963
Home.

804
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,842
Trixie. Ha-ha!

805
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:52,926
You're a genius.

806
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:55,346
You just reminded me
where I left something.

807
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:57,973
[laughs]

808
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:05,064
He's not at the doughnut shop,
the zoo or the Gas 'n' Grub. [scoffs]

809
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:06,524
Have you checked the park?

810
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,817
Of course I checked the park.
I'm not an idiot!

811
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:12,446
- [sighs] Well, I mean, you did lose Dad.
- He was gone when I arrived.

812
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,990
What part
of "united front" do you not understand?

813
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,034
If we just forced Dad
to confront his issues...

814
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:19,161
I'm not forcing Dad to do anything, Lucy!

815
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,413
He's our father, all right?

816
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,040
God Almighty!

817
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:27,253
And you really should start
showing him a little bit more respect.

818
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:30,297
He is an old man
who has lost control of his powers,

819
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:33,842
and now he's out there
somewhere lost and alone and afraid!

820
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:36,928
He's afraid.

821
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,473
[God] Who's afraid?

822
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,060
[Lucifer] Dad! Where have you...

823
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,895
You can't just run off like that!

824
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,981
Do you have any idea
what you put us through?

825
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,483
I'm starting to think I do, actually.

826
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,068
[door opens]

827
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:54,863
But not to worry,
everything's going to be just fine.

828
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:58,867
[Lucifer] I hope by "fine"
you mean you've managed to locate

829
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:00,953
the power to create
and destroy the universe,

830
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:04,039
that you lost because
you were busy drinking a Gulpee.

831
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,207
I'm sorry, what?

832
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,292
[Lucifer sighs]

833
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:09,295
Well, I have remembered
where I put my powers, yes.

834
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,798
Thank you
for holding onto this for me, Charlie.

835
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,468
I knew it would be safe with family.

836
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:23,517
[chiming intensifies]

837
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,935
[whooshing]

838
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,448
[exhales]

839
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:41,994
[coos]

840
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:43,120
What just happened?

841
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:46,332
[dance music playing]

842
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,091
Yo.

843
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:58,344
What's up?

844
00:43:58,427 --> 00:43:59,678
Rough day?

845
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,350
Couldn't kill God. You?

846
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:08,646
I think... God killed me.

847
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:13,400
- We're gonna need more drinks.
- [Mazikeen] Yeah.

848
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,656
[sighs]

849
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,532
[God] Thank you for not killing me.

850
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,079
[exhales]

851
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:29,291
I didn't want Trixie
to see that kind of violence.

852
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:33,462
You were following me
for quite a while before Trixie showed up.

853
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,966
Mazikeen, you <i>chose</i> not to kill me.

854
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,220
Fine.

855
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:44,390
You created me to be a killer,
and I can't even do <i>that</i> right.

856
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:48,352
"Perfect the way I am,"
my demon ass.

857
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,690
The funny thing about miracles...

858
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,276
is they happen every day.

859
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,363
An angel has a child with a human.

860
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:01,323
The Devil can fall in love.

861
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,326
We can all learn.

862
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:06,495
And we can all grow.

863
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:12,543
But a demon can't grow a soul.

864
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:15,670
Can't she?

865
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,012
[gasps]

866
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:26,598
[exhales]

867
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:30,852
[exhales]

868
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:35,107
- [Dan groans] Oh!
- [liquid spills]

869
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,029
You know what?

870
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,784
I slept with your wife,

871
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:49,663
and I can't change that,
even if I wanted to.

872
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:52,707
Which I don't.

873
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,169
So smite me.

874
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:58,088
Turn me into a pillar of salt.

875
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,381
Whatever you do.

876
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:03,761
[laughs] Let's just get it over with.

877
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:07,514
It's not my business who
my ex-wife spent her time with, Daniel.

878
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:11,101
The truth is, I wasn't the best husband,

879
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:15,022
and I'm grateful she found someone
to give her the love she deserved.

880
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,190
Thank you.

881
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:24,406
- [exhales]
- [laughs]

882
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:42,966
Um, Trix, there are, uh,
some things that we need to talk about.

883
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:44,968
It's okay, Mom.

884
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:48,096
I learned today
that grown-ups make mistakes too.

885
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,641
And I forgive you.

886
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,309
Oh.

887
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:56,063
Well, that is nice of you to say.

888
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,314
And, um, you're right,

889
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:01,485
you know, everybody does make mistakes,

890
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:06,365
but it's important that we own up
to our mistakes when we make them.

891
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:08,784
I'm sorry for what I did at school.

892
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:10,369
I'm glad to hear you say that.

893
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:16,291
You know, I'm sorry too,
for my mistakes and, um...

894
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:21,255
I really should have realized
that you're not a little kid anymore.

895
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:25,008
You're beautiful, smart...

896
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,802
I can tell you're sad, Mom.

897
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:30,847
I know you can.

898
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:38,313
Even when I'm not willing
to admit it to myself. I know, honey.

899
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:39,397
Denial.

900
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:41,900
It happens to the best of us.

901
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:44,194
[laughs]

902
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:45,278
Yes.

903
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,072
You're right.

904
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:48,782
[sighs] You're so smart.

905
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:52,369
You know, when you were younger, I...

906
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:58,083
I tried to protect you,
to shield you from difficult feelings,

907
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,085
and situations.

908
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:06,967
But I think now, maybe, the best thing
that I can do for you is to let you in

909
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,219
and, um, and admit that...

910
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:13,307
Mom doesn't always feel so strong inside.

911
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,143
You're upset about Lucifer.

912
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,019
Aren't you?

913
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,191
[smacks lips]

914
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:24,942
Well...

915
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,030
the truth is, is, um...

916
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,909
things between Lucifer and me,

917
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:34,620
they are a little up in the air right now.

918
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:40,834
And, uh, I'm not sure
if we will, uh, end up as partners

919
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:44,254
or friends, or something more,

920
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:48,300
but, uh, if he and I
are gonna try and figure this out...

921
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:53,388
I have to tell him my real feelings.

922
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:55,349
And then what's gonna happen?

923
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,184
[exhales]

924
00:48:58,602 --> 00:48:59,645
[sighs]

925
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:05,233
I don't know.

926
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,863
And that's a little scary.

927
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:14,242
And I'm sure
it's scary for you too, right?

928
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:20,999
But here's the thing, Trix.

929
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:25,379
No matter what happens,
and no matter if you're 11...

930
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:28,340
or 111...

931
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:34,805
if the Earth gets hit by
an asteroid made of rock candy

932
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:37,849
and the sky starts raining down gumdrops...

933
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,730
me and your dad
will always be your parents.

934
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,275
And we will always love you,
no matter what.

935
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:49,819
Promise?

936
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:52,613
Promise.

937
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:05,794
[glasses clink]

938
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:07,170
I will miss the buzz.

939
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:11,466
You're all-powerful again, Dad,
so can't you just buzz yourself?

940
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,511
[chuckles] We need to talk.

941
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:18,890
[sighs]

942
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:23,978
Okay.

943
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,314
Father, what is it?

944
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:27,566
Lucifer was right.

945
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:31,862
Twice in one millennium.
Will wonders never cease?

946
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:34,573
[God] It's not just the music.

947
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,785
Or the fact that I misplaced my powers.

948
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,496
The truth is,

949
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,790
I've been slipping for quite a while.

950
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,502
For longer than I'd like to admit.

951
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:51,506
I guess you get
your denial from your father.

952
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:52,799
What denial?

953
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,969
[chuckles] Kidding.

954
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,053
Mostly.

955
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:02,768
Now, let's just keep this between
the three of us, for now. Shall we?

956
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:04,770
Father, what are you saying?

957
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,396
I think it's time.

958
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,690
Time for what?

959
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:11,693
Time for me to retire.

960
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:19,534
- Dad.
- Dad, uh...
