00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,640
[Lucifer] <i>So you're telling me that
my dickhead twin</i>

2
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:18,643
showed up on Earth, assumed my identity,

3
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:21,354
and then wreaked all sorts of havoc
on my life?

4
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:23,106
That about covers it, yes.

5
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,985
Great. Great, and you came down here
to tell me this why?

6
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:29,237
Just to torture me? [sighs]

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,197
I suppose this is
the appropriate place for it.

8
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:34,242
Yeah, is there somewhere else
that we can talk?

9
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,579
I don't like having private conversations
in the hallways,

10
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:39,414
and Kenneth doesn't mind, do you, Kenny?

11
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:42,167
- It's not funny. It's not funny!
- No.

12
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,793
No, it certainly isn't.

13
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,796
My slopey-shouldered brother
is pulling a prank

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,591
hardly worthy of <i>Saved by the Bell</i>
in order to humiliate me.

15
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:52,469
This isn't about you, Lucy.
Michael's threatened Charlie's safety.

16
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,762
Oh, please.

17
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,014
Michael needles people's fears.

18
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,265
It's what he does.

19
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:00,477
But we also know
he's all bark and no bite.

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,187
Don't you remember, growing up?

21
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,190
He'd get under your skin
with one of his schemes,

22
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,870
then you'd give him one of your
atomic wedgies, and that'd be that.

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,818
I don't think a wedgie's gonna do it
this time.

24
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:13,239
Things have... changed up in Heaven.

25
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,242
Last time I was there,

26
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:20,205
Michael had managed to seat himself
at Father's right hand.

27
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,375
So, Dad's talking to him?

28
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,543
No.

29
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,129
No, he's talking to Father,
but he's the only one.

30
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,632
Nobody else in the Silver City
has a line to Him.

31
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,550
Nobody, and Michael has seen to it.

32
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:33,967
Michael?

33
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,805
Weaselly, cowardly Michael?

34
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:39,641
[scoffs] Now suddenly the power
behind the throne?

35
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,976
Without being able to speak to Father,
who knows?

36
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,354
But he is stronger than you think, Lucy.

37
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,439
Michael's become...

38
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,942
untouchable in the Silver City.

39
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:53,571
Well, he's not in the Silver City now,
is he?

40
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,074
So excuse me while I go touch him.

41
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:01,162
I can see how that's
a poor choice of words.

42
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:02,746
Just...

43
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,749
hold the fort while I'm gone.

44
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,877
- Hold the...
- [door slams]

45
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,044
What?

46
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,467
[recording of clown laugh plays]

47
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,553
[circus music plays]

48
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,262
Should we...

49
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,141
get back to work or...

50
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:38,825
[sighs]

51
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:42,036
Burnt coffee and body odor
never smelled so good.

52
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,625
Hm.

53
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,007
Hello, Detective.

54
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,758
No. No.

55
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,177
Get the hell out of here.

56
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,530
- Detective, I can explain.
- No, I don't want to hear it.

57
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:02,974
If you didn't understand
the first four times I shot you,

58
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,643
I will gladly shoot you again, Michael.

59
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,354
It's me. It's Lucifer.

60
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,982
- Do you expect me to fall for that again?
- But...

61
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,193
Look at the hair...

62
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,570
or the perfectly arranged pocket square.

63
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,406
Could Michael pull this off?
I don't think so. [chuckles]

64
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,033
[Chloe] I...

65
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,659
Cacuzza, come here. Come here.

66
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,411
Oh, it's good to see you again.

67
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,495
- Hi.
- Tell me.

68
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,540
What is it you desire?

69
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,625
I...

70
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,671
I want to figure out how
to disable the cameras in Evidence

71
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,048
so I can nap in there.

72
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,008
Oh! Naughty you.

73
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,091
Thank you.

74
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,845
Now, I know my brother can't do that.

75
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,389
It's really you.

76
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,226
[exhales sharply]

77
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:47,685
How?

78
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,062
It's a funny story, actually.

79
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,522
So, there I was in Hell, and...

80
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,440
[sighs]

81
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,625
Unfortunately, I can't stay for long.

82
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,210
Day job and all that.

83
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,294
It's okay...

84
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,504
I understand.

85
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,800
I just... I just needed
to make sure you're okay.

86
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,887
But of course you saw
through Michael's charade,

87
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,722
my clever Detective.

88
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,809
Well, I... It did take a bit.

89
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,811
He was very convincing.

90
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,648
- And some of the things he said were...
- Well, good news on that front.

91
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:37,318
Every word that comes out
of that admittedly dashing face is a lie.

92
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,239
Oh, well, that's a relief,
because he said something so insane,

93
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,324
I, well, obviously knew
it had to be a lie.

94
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,243
[groans] Did he claim
he's friends with Elvis?

95
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,966
'Cause the King's still alive and
I'm the only one who knows where.

96
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,456
- So...
- [laughs] No, he told me...

97
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:54,836
Get this, he told me that
I was a gift from God.

98
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,588
[laughs] That's, uh...

99
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,715
That's what he said.

100
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,425
I mean, that's... [chuckles]

101
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,427
That's crazy.

102
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,096
That's...

103
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,558
That's not true, right?

104
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,143
[Lucifer exhales nervously]

105
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,602
Lucifer, I am not...

106
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,648
a gift from God made just for you, right?

107
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:18,859
Yes.

108
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,239
I-I know how it sounds, but...

109
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,949
trust me, when my mom told me...

110
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,242
Your mom told you?

111
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,494
Your mom told...

112
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,121
What? Over a year ago?

113
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,581
You've kept this the whole time?

114
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:35,001
Well, back then, you didn't even believe
in the celestial side of things.

115
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,920
A-A-Anyway, Mom only told me
because she was trying to keep us apart.

116
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,004
Why...

117
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,800
Why? 'Cause if you knew I were a gift
from your dad, you'd what, throw me away?

118
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,302
She thought if I knew the truth,

119
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,721
it would mean the feelings
that I had for you weren't real,

120
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:50,016
that I'd feel you were just some...
some tool to manipulate me.

121
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,312
But I don't feel that way,

122
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,314
because I realized, D-Detective,

123
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,983
I realized
that whether you were made for me or not,

124
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,401
it doesn't matter.

125
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,071
Well, it matters to me.

126
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,948
Hey, we've got a body. WB Studios.

127
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,034
Oh...

128
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,660
Unless I'm interrupting.

129
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,662
No. You're not interrupting.

130
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,330
Perfect timing.

131
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,875
Such a gift. [scoffs]

132
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,712
Wow. Huh.

133
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,297
Hey, that... That reminds me.

134
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,799
I made something for you.

135
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:24,926
It's just like mine.

Huh?

137
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,515
Why on Earth would I want that? Detective!

138
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:31,682
Detective, wait.

139
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,893
No, I don't have time for this.
I have work to do.

140
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,687
But, Detective,
you're the only reason I'm here.

141
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:39,565
Apparently you're the only reason
<i>I'm</i> here.

142
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,276
So I'm going to do my job that I chose.

143
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,822
And don't you have somewhere to be?

144
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:51,202
Oh, Michael, you bastard.

- Hey.

00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:11,638
What do we have?

149
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,558
Meet Matt Owens,

150
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,059
stabbed to death.

151
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,853
We're still looking for the murder weapon.

152
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,062
He was a TV writer.

153
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,147
A showrunner, in fact,

154
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,315
in charge of a series
that shoots here on the lot.

155
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,317
I mean, dude's gotta figure,

156
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:27,113
he's the boss, he's got all these plans,
and then bam!

157
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,282
Somebody else has a plan for him,
you know?

158
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,700
Hmm. Yeah.

159
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,242
You okay?

160
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:37,623
[groans] Lucifer and I had, um, sort of
a difficult conversation.

161
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,126
I... I might have told him to go to Hell.

162
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,628
Oh, yeah, relationship drama.

163
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,380
Huh, believe me, I hear ya.

164
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,133
I could tell you some stories,
like this one time in Mexico,

165
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:50,094
but I totally will not
tell you some stories, 'cause...

166
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,095
[Chloe] Mm-hmm.

167
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,179
...trust me.

168
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,891
If the worst thing you said to him was
"Go to Hell"...

169
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,535
- [engine revs]
- ...you're totally okay.

170
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,895
Well, you'd think that, but...

171
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,062
Detective!

172
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,856
- Lucifer.
- Detective.

173
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,148
Thank you.

174
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,066
[Chloe] Hey!

175
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,359
- You're still here.
- Yes.

176
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,154
And I'm not going anywhere
until I know you're okay.

00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,530
Oh. Well...

178
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:13,159
Well, I mean, I'm...
I'm happy to hear that, but I'm sorry.

179
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,076
I mean...

180
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,288
If God made me for you, He probably
would want me to feel that way.

181
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,372
- [sighs]
- So I just...

182
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,583
I need a little time to absorb
all of it.

183
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,503
Right. Well, in the meantime,
why don't we absorb whilst we work?

184
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,881
I may as well help solve this murder
for you whilst I'm up here fixing things.

185
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:29,926
Uh, I don't think this is an easy fix.
This isn't one of those cases

186
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,470
where you just waltz in
and figure it out as you go.

187
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,263
Oh. Hello.

188
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,224
I know that man.

189
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,225
Really?

190
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,270
Yes, that's Matt Owens.

191
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,189
I did him a favor a couple years ago

192
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,942
to help get his career started
as a TV writer.

193
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,569
Huh. That does sound like our victim.

194
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,030
- Huh. You really know him?
- Oh, yes.

195
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:54,617
Yes. I mean, even after the favor,
he'd come over and we'd talk for hours.

196
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,161
It's funny, I've been wondering
what he was up to recently.

197
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,538
You know, before I went...

198
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,789
- Right.
- Yeah.

199
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,041
I may know the answer to that.

200
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,463
[Lucifer] Huh.

201
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:12,343
Actually, now I think of it,
we did mostly talk about me.

202
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,386
Hm.

203
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,721
Huh.

204
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,819
- [groans]
- I have to hand it to you, Diablo,

205
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:33,573
your unorthodox method solved the case
that stumped the rest of us.

206
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,367
You managed to bring in the kidnapper
and rescue his victim

207
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,869
in time to administer
her life-saving insulin.

208
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,038
It's damn fine police work.

209
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,834
It was a devil of a case, but
this scum didn't stand a chance in Hell.

210
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:46,794
Book him.

211
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:48,879
Diablo,

212
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:49,963
I don't get it.

213
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,925
How did you manage to get a lead
from a single strand of dental floss?

214
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,721
[laughs] Like I keep telling you,
Detective Doofus...

215
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,306
[officers laugh]

216
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,933
...I've got connections in the underworld.

217
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,522
- This is the show that you helped Matt...
- Shh!

218
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,358
This is the show that you helped Matt
get on the air?

219
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,276
No, no, no.

220
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,320
All I did was introduce him
to a network exec.

221
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,989
I had no idea why he was asking me
so many questions.

222
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,659
But I have to say, it's shocking.

223
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:22,705
I mean, the way in which he's brought
my descriptions to life, the accuracy,

224
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,248
is truly eerie.

225
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,918
I can see why he had
such a meteoric rise in the biz.

226
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,063
Obviously the man was a tremendous talent.
Thank you.

227
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,297
- [Chloe sighs]
- Thank you.

228
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,506
Oh, no, thanks.

229
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:33,965
Huh?

230
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,427
City Council...

231
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,763
has asked me to present you...

232
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:40,847
with this.

233
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,893
[officers cheering]

234
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,815
Thank you, everyone.

235
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,610
But really, I should share this
with my partner.

236
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:53,569
Where is she?

237
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,820
Detective Dancer?

238
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,284
Sorry, Diablo.

239
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,453
I was just pumping a suspect for leads.

240
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:04,788
Oh!

241
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,415
Is that a commendation for you?

242
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,042
For <i>us.</i>

243
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,503
If anyone deserves this,

244
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:13,798
it's a woman who's gone from
the stripper pole to the detective pool

245
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,049
in just three years.

246
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,467
Oh, dear.

247
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,886
I think you could have given it
a once-over.

248
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,304
It's a bit tarnished.

249
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:21,764
[both gasp]

250
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,058
Don't worry, Diablo.

251
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,894
You know I'll polish your bugle any time.

252
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,732
[man] And... cut!

253
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,027
Great. Circle back.

254
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,569
That's...

255
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,115
Is that how you described me to him?

256
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,992
Well, Matt didn't know everything.

257
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,413
Obviously, he took some creative license.

258
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,666
Are they going again?

259
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:52,962
[stage bell rings]

260
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,424
So it seems a little odd
that you all are shooting today,

261
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,551
since your showrunner was killed
this morning.

262
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,096
Matt would've wanted us to keep going.
We're the biggest hit of the fall,

263
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,459
and he was really proud of that.

264
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,599
People can't get enough Diablo.

265
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,268
[chuckles] Hear, hear.

266
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:10,062
Well, I think it's gross
that we're still working.

267
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,858
I mean, in all honesty,
I know it's bad to speak ill of the dead,

268
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,941
but I'm not surprised
someone stabbed Matt, either.

269
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:17,862
Um, why not?

270
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,572
The man was a control freak.

271
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,950
I mean, I know all showrunners
have to have an ego, but...

272
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,745
Matt was a megalomaniac.

273
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,872
Come on. The man was an artist.

274
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:30,499
- Sorry, is that a vape pen?
- Hot cinnamon.

275
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,293
Keeps the weight off.

276
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,253
[groans] You were doing so well.

277
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,255
So, the megalomaniac showrunner,

278
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,458
did he choose your wardrobe?

279
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,841
All his idea.

280
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,843
I wear what he gives me,
go where he tells me.

281
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,012
Oh. Okay.

282
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,805
I mean, does that bother you at all,

283
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:48,684
that you have no say
in what your character does or says?

284
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,602
Are you kidding?

285
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,688
I'm a lead in a hit show, and you know,

286
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,816
there are strippers out there
considering becoming detectives now.

287
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,611
I'm kind of a role model.

288
00:12:58,694 --> 00:12:59,737
Oh, lovely.

289
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,113
Matt gave me that.

290
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,490
Interesting.

291
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,827
So, anyhow, did either of you
have a problem with Matt?

292
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,454
Us? No way.

293
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,623
[inhales sharply]
But let me tell you something.

294
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,626
I've been doing this job
for seven episodes now,

295
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:17,296
and if there's one thing I've learned,
it's why people kill.

296
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:18,379
Oh?

297
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,675
It's 'cause they yearn for something.
You want to find the killer,

298
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,511
figure out their yearning.

299
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,721
Right. Isn't there a better word for that?

300
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:26,639
No.

301
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:27,848
So, okay.

302
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,518
Who do you think yearned to kill Matt?

303
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,103
Keri Belwood, his number two.

304
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,355
You should talk to her.

305
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,024
Everyone knows she did all the work
on the scripts

306
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,187
and he took all the credit.

307
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,861
So Keri killed Matt
to finally be in charge?

308
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:41,945
Yes.

309
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,449
Her yearning was for his job.

310
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,494
Well, uh, of course, possibly.

311
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,746
There could be other motives to kill him.

312
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:54,041
Oh-oh! Sounds like we have
a Dancer answer.

313
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,376
- What?
- See,

314
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:59,713
Diablo comes up with the wild theories
and crazy hijinks,

315
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,090
and Dancer's the fun police.

316
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,467
"That's not procedure, Diablo."

317
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,054
- [laughs]
- Mm. I get it.

318
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,766
Okay. Well, thank you for your time.

319
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,060
Yes. Thank you.

320
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,106
Do they seem familiar to you?

321
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:19,817
[Dancer sighs]

322
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,902
So you left Amenadiel in Hell?

323
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,028
[Lucifer] Really, Doctor?

324
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,240
An evil twin, the detective finding out
she's a gift from God,

325
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,763
and that's the part you're stuck on?

326
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,158
Amenadiel.

327
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,329
The father of my child.

328
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:34,622
Oh, yes.

329
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,835
Heh. Well, not to worry, Doctor.
I'll, uh...

330
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,170
I'll put what Michael did right
and get Amenadiel back

331
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,506
before Charlie even notices
he's gone, okay?

332
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,966
But what about Michael?

333
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,260
Do you even know where he is?

334
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,512
Well, if past is prologue,

335
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:52,266
he's probably hidden himself off somewhere
to laugh about the mess he's made...

336
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,185
which is actually why I'm here.

337
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,355
Michael didn't coax any awful,

338
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,691
soul-poisoning fears out of you, did he?

339
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,734
Me? No.

340
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:03,776
No.

341
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,738
No, not... Not out of me.

342
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,197
- No.
- Good.

343
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,366
Good, well...

344
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,118
that's a relief, 'cause I worry that this

345
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,521
"not having any free will
and being a puppet of fate" thing

346
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,497
may have
knocked the detective off her stride.

347
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,581
May have?

348
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,960
Lucifer, when you come back unexpectedly

349
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:24,423
and casually drop celestial bombs
on the people in your life,

350
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,676
you have to expect some shock...

351
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,346
some anger, some frustration.

352
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:34,975
In my defense, this particular bomb
was planted by my father

353
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,560
and set off by my brother, so...

354
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:40,064
Okay, well, instead of deflecting
responsibility, try empathizing.

355
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:44,360
Try really listening
to what your friends are saying.

356
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:49,114
What, so if I give people the opportunity,
they'll tell me what to do?

357
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,991
Exactly, like,

358
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,470
- bring back my baby's daddy from Hell.
- Yes, yes. Thank you.

359
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,494
I've got to go.

360
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:55,828
To Hell?

361
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,167
No, to find out what other chaos
Michael may have caused up here.

362
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,170
I mean, who knows how many people
I'll have to listen to?

363
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,337
[scoffs]

364
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,386
Thank you.

365
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,348
Keri Belwood? Detective Decker, LAPD.

366
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,100
I figured I'd be your first stop.

367
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,560
Why is that? In my experience,

368
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,397
the innocent don't normally expect
to be questioned by the police.

369
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,525
I've written 100 episodes
of TV murder mysteries

370
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,610
and I got the carpal tunnel to prove it.

371
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,487
Motive, opportunity...

372
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,446
It adds up.

373
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:34,042
Well, you know the math on this.
I can see why Matt put you in charge.

374
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,496
Yeah, I was the one who was always here
doing most of the work,

375
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,581
but I was definitely not in charge.

376
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,667
Matt was the worst kind of boss:

377
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,877
lazy and a control freak.

378
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,130
I can see why he'd be hard to deal with.

379
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,214
No, not really.

380
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,634
He never even came into the writers' room.
I'd usually send him a script overnight,

381
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,012
and by the morning,
it'd be completely changed.

382
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:56,765
So you and the writers would work in here
well into the night,

383
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,851
and then Matt would come
and undo all the work?

384
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,811
Do you know how dispiriting it is

385
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,022
to spend days figuring out
a clever clue path

386
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,816
just for your boss to replace it
with a lap dance?

387
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,819
Hmm. Yeah, I can see why

388
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,262
you doing all that work
and feeling like you have no control

389
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,198
could possibly make you angry.

390
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,286
My assistant can vouch that
I was here writing all morning.

391
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,122
So if you're suggesting
that I killed Matt to take his job,

392
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,623
then you need a new theory.

393
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:25,794
Besides, showrunners have all the power,
but you know what else they get?

394
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,170
The blame.

395
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,757
But I thought the show was doing well.

396
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,258
Well, that's almost worse.

397
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,385
You got a network show that's a hit,

398
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,013
suddenly everybody at the studio
takes an interest.

399
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,016
Everybody wants a piece of it,
and the second the ratings dip,

400
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,851
everyone wants someone to blame.

401
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,269
No, thanks.

402
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,563
I already got two ex-husbands
and three kids.

403
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,774
I don't need a drug problem
on top of that.

404
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:48,984
Matt had a drug problem?

405
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,195
All I know is,

406
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,489
one night Matt's email was down,

407
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,866
so I had to hand-deliver
a script at midnight.

408
00:17:56,325 --> 00:18:00,287
He has me bring it to a seedy motel
full of tweakers and burnouts.

409
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,915
Insane writer under intense pressure

410
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,125
holed up in a crime-infested drug den?

411
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,796
Even Diablo could follow that clue path.

412
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,215
I see.

413
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,551
Well, I'll need you to give
an official statement at the precinct,

414
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,715
and then also, if you have
the address of that motel.

415
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,138
Sure.

416
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:27,940
Oh, Michael.

417
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:32,903
Of all the things you've done to hurt me,
this might cut the deepest.

418
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,196
[blades scraping]

419
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,825
Maze.

420
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:41,745
Oh! I missed you while I was gone.
[laughs]

421
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,289
You know, there was
a few tough nuts down there,

422
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,750
and there were times
I could've really used your blades!

423
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,044
[roars]

424
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,005
[grunting]

425
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,590
Mazikeen, please, let me explain.

426
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,008
- Mazikeen!
- [yells]

427
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,304
Hey!

428
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,523
- [roars]
- Listen to me, Mazikeen!

429
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,358
I'm not Michael. It's me.

430
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,526
Lucifer.

431
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:13,694
[panting]

432
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,486
Oh!

433
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,031
[grunts]

434
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,617
Wait. Wait, wait.

435
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,661
Would you rather that I was Michael?

436
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:23,744
Either.

437
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,914
He left me in the closet, but you...

438
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,584
You went to Hell without me.

439
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,919
You left me!

440
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,338
No, I didn't, Mazikeen.

441
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,633
You're not my servant anymore.
By all means, you're welcome to join me.

442
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,802
I don't have wings, you idiot!

443
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,179
Well, Amenadiel does.

444
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,723
Why didn't you just ask him
to fly you down there?

445
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,182
[scoffs]

446
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,609
[grunts] Look, I'm really trying
to listen,

447
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,820
so if you're telling me
that you'd like to stab me, then...

448
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,199
Just avoid the old parsnip,
for old time's sake.

449
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,412
Well, you know, my twin is
still likely skulking around.

450
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,497
It'd be a big help
if you'd like to stab him.

451
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,335
Stab him yourself.

452
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:12,920
[elevator dings]

453
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,131
Unbelievable.

454
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,347
Ah! Detective.

455
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,933
Sorry I'm late. Forgot about the traffic.

456
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,184
So, where are we going?

457
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,393
Uh, Room 18.

458
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,270
Oh, right. Good news.

459
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:33,774
Linda's fine, and Maze is, well, Maze.

460
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,902
And I figured out
how to fix things between us.

461
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,948
- Oh, how's that?
- Well, you're going to tell me what to do.

462
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:44,534
Ah, well, I'm sure that makes sense
to someone.

463
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,452
Yes.

464
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:48,080
Anyhow, so Matt had no family,
lived alone...

465
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,332
If he had a drug problem,
why not stay home?

466
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,126
Illicit venue for illicit acts, I suppose.

467
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:57,047
Be prepared for a good old-fashioned
Hollywood den of sin.

468
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:00,841
[Chloe] Hmm.

469
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,469
Huh.

470
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,721
Well, this place looks pretty tidy.

471
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,556
Doesn't look like a drug den to me.

472
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,310
I knew TV writing isn't all
hookers and blow like the '80s,

473
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,063
but I had no idea how sad it had got.

474
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,148
Over here? Number 18?

475
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,150
Hold on, someone's in there.

476
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,404
- Freeze! LAPD!
- Freeze! LAPD!

477
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,905
- Drop the gun!
- Drop the gun!

478
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,826
Wait. I'm a real cop with a real gun.

479
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:26,994
That's a prop.

480
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,370
Put it down.

481
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,414
Sorry. Force of habit. [chuckles]

482
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:34,251
Well, that little showdown will be fueling
my fantasies for the next few millennia.

483
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,753
- [Diablo chuckles]
- What are you two doing here?

484
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,588
Trying to solve the case, of course.

485
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,257
We can do it on TV.

486
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,717
Why not in real life?

487
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,012
- Mm.
- How did you find out about this place?

488
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,221
I found this...

489
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,099
where Matt was killed.

490
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,184
Fell out of his pocket.

491
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:55,022
Just a little thing
I like to call "evidence."

492
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,190
You stole evidence from the crime scene?

493
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,068
To be fair, Detective,
that is absolutely on-brand.

494
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,195
Well, this is really bringing it back.

495
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,532
I'd almost forgotten how much fun
solving murders is. [chuckles]

496
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,367
Uh, excuse me. [clears throat]

497
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:09,618
Um...

498
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,664
What are you doing with this idiot?

499
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,409
[Dancer] Well, he was going to come
with or without me,

500
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,171
and at least if I'm here,
I can keep him safe.

501
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,882
I didn't realize you two were this close.

502
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,215
Oh, yeah.

503
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,679
And if something does happen to him,
our show dies for real,

504
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,724
and I cannot go through
another pilot season.

505
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,978
I've just realized why this place
feels so familiar.

506
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,689
This is where Matt was living
when I first met him.

507
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:41,526
Matt mentioned he had a place he liked to
hide from the world when he was writing,

508
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,570
where none of the execs could find him.

509
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:47,908
Oh, so he didn't hole up here
to go on a drug binge.

510
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:50,994
He came here to reconnect with a time
in his life where he felt control

511
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,245
over his fate.

512
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,539
Returning to the place where it all began.

513
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,874
Yearning to find buzz...

514
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:56,958
Okay, thank you.

515
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,460
Okay, you two, out, all right?

516
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,223
I have to bag the whole place
for evidence,

517
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,797
and you both are not cops.

518
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,632
- So play time's over. Out!
- D... Don't...

519
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,385
Don't take offense. She used to say
the exact same thing to me.

520
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,468
[chuckles]

521
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,347
And you, too.

522
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:12,848
Out.

523
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,685
Right, well, if that's what
you're telling me, Detective...

524
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,270
I am, yes. I'm feeling a little...

525
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,357
uh, overwhelmed by,

526
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,318
um, well, <i>you </i>right now.

527
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:27,696
Right.

528
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:34,703
[Ella] <i>I don't get it.</i>

529
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:38,291
Dude had a glamorous job, tons of money,

530
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,877
and he ate Panda Express,
like, six times a week.

531
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,505
People are who they are, I guess.

532
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:44,922
Yeah.

533
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:48,093
Do you believe in the idea
of predestination?

534
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:51,012
Where you're forced to walk a path
that's already laid out for you?

535
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,514
Are you kidding?

536
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:56,601
My childhood and family background,
surrounded by criminals and dirt bags,

537
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,186
I should've ended up in jail.

538
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:01,648
But instead, I chose to get right
with the Big Guy,

539
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,651
walk the straight and narrow,
and here I am,

540
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,863
living proof that people can change
old, bad patterns.

541
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,490
Hmm.

542
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,117
You got a text.

543
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,118
[Ella] Mm.

544
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,870
Oh! Whoa, that's a penis.

545
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,288
That's a tattooed penis.

546
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,211
Some patterns are harder to change
than others.

547
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,792
Wow... Uh, looks familiar.

548
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:21,876
Wait, you know Craig?

549
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:22,918
No, this.

550
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:27,174
[sniffs] No, I don't know Craig
and his tattooed penis.

551
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:37,726
Hey, pal.

552
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,769
- Come on, man, that's my cup.
- Is it?

553
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:41,980
Are you doing okay?

554
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,565
Just fine, up until this very moment.

555
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,358
I'm just listening to the detective.

556
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,081
What, you're listening to her
from out here?

557
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:53,366
Well, I'm certainly not listening to you,
so goodbye.

558
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,344
- I know you're trying to push me away.
- [sighs]

559
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,578
I brought curiosity in that,

560
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,830
and I realized you're just
in a projective state,

561
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,559
'cause you're feeling vulnerable
right now, and that's pretty scary.

562
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,583
Oh.

563
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,085
Detective Douche,

564
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,379
if you want to see something really scary,

565
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:09,799
wait until you see what your new all-soy
diet is doing to your bone density.

566
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,803
You got a lot of ugly pictures
in your head, man.

567
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,637
You need to work
on positive visualization.

568
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,847
I made a lot of progress with that.
It can help you.

569
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,644
Actually, maybe you can help me.

570
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,772
This cosmic impotence,

571
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:27,234
the knowledge that you're the plaything
of a cruel, uncaring God,

572
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:32,322
the suffocating feeling that everything
you've ever accomplished is meaningless...

573
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:35,325
You're the perfect person
to ask about these things.

574
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,785
Tell me, when you were born...

575
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:37,702
[Chloe] Hi.

576
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,205
So, we have a new suspect
in Matt Owen's murder.

577
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:42,706
[sniffs]

578
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,460
A hot cinnamon vape cartridge?

579
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,463
Really, Detective, no one is
more horrified by this than me,

580
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,465
but it doesn't make Diablo our killer.

581
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:54,386
No, but Diablo did say that
he hadn't been to that room before.

582
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:57,806
Ella found this buried in two days
of Matt's trash, so why lie?

583
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,601
That cheeky devil.

584
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,394
Huh.

585
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,689
I just don't get it, Detective.

586
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:08,942
Why would an actor kill a man
who gave him the role of a lifetime?

587
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:10,277
I don't know.

588
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,487
Maybe he didn't like
being someone else's puppet?

589
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:13,822
[Lucifer sighs]

590
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,741
Sir, please, your scene was
supposed to start 40 minutes ago.

591
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,121
Uh, stand aside, please.

592
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,830
Thank you.

593
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,172
Oh, man.

594
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:46,146
How could nobody notice him missing
since lunch?

595
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:48,189
I mean, this man is the entire show.

596
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,567
None of these people would even exist
without him here.

597
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,819
Yeah. Okay.

598
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:56,072
Yep, everyone around is just here
to service you...

599
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:56,990
I mean...

600
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:58,199
[chuckles] Diablo.

601
00:26:58,742 --> 00:26:59,576
I mean Diablo.

602
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:03,121
Anyhow, so, yes, he was stabbed, too,
hopefully with the same instrument.

603
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,789
If we can find the murder weapon...

604
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,082
Found the murder weapon!

605
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:09,085
It's actually a prop from the show,

606
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,631
supposed to be the only blade
that can kill the Devil.

607
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,883
- [Lucifer chuckles]
- How ironic is that, right?

608
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,968
- [laughs]
- Hi-ya!

609
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,890
Sorry, that seemed
a lot funnier in my head.

610
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,808
- I'm sure.
- Um... [chuckles]

611
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,652
That's rubber.
It can't be the murder weapon.

612
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,729
Uh, well, this is the stunt murder weapon.

613
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,940
See, this is the rubber version
they use for action sequences.

614
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:34,611
The one they use for close-ups
is sharp and metal, so...

615
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:37,447
we find that one, we find our murderer.

616
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,530
Huh.

617
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,166
<i>Blaze,</i>

618
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:52,045
<i>tell the girls to swap their G-strings
for evening gowns tomorrow night.</i>

619
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,128
Wow.

620
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,507
It's like looking into a mirror.

621
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,802
<i>Of course, my liege.</i>

622
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,554
Simpler times.

623
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,849
Me and Lucifer, together,

624
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,102
side by side for eons.

625
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:11,064
<i>...waste my demonic diesel
behind this bar.</i>

626
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,858
Now everyone just comes and goes.

627
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:18,278
Okay.

628
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,950
Maze, you know I'm not going anywhere...

629
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:23,659
right?

630
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,704
Maybe not on purpose, but...

631
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:28,581
you're gonna drop dead in, what,
five years?

632
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,377
How old do you think I am?

633
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,462
I don't know, 30?

634
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,631
[sighs deeply]

635
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,509
Maze, you have nothing to worry about.

636
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,053
I'm going to be around for a while.

637
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,472
And then I'll be down in Hell,

638
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:48,935
and I guess we can spend
the rest of eternity together, right?

639
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,395
[chuckles]

640
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,020
Sure, I guess.

641
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:55,358
[clears throat]

642
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:59,279
I think what you're struggling with
is a fear of abandonment.

643
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,324
It's completely normal.

644
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:05,868
It comes from...

645
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,331
someone important to you
letting you down in your youth.

646
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:14,210
I didn't have anyone important
in my youth, Linda.

647
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:16,838
Just my blades.

648
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,883
They have never let me down.

649
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,845
It can cause a lot of anxiety
in intimate relationships.

650
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,724
You know, but it's something
we can work on...

651
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:28,725
Oh, my.

652
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,852
<i>...suffers most is the Devil himself.</i>

653
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,562
I suppose that's me.

654
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:35,315
<i>...back into Hell itself.
But until that day,</i>

655
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,400
<i>I intend to enjoy the Earth.</i>

656
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:40,653
<i>Come here, Doctor.
I'm ready for my treatment.</i>

657
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,409
This is gonna be good.

658
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,994
Yeah, I'll have some of that.

659
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:51,747
Great, thank you.

660
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,887
[Lucifer]
This one would have been amazing.

661
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,377
Diablo was going to solve a crime
in space.

662
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,046
Oh. Mm-hmm.

663
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,882
And what was Dancer doing,
a zero-G striptease?

664
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:02,509
Have you read this already?

665
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,805
[sighs] Look, Detective...

666
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:11,226
I want you to know that I understand.

667
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:14,687
I know how powerless I felt
when Mom told me the truth about you.

668
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,564
That's right,
your mother told you the truth.

669
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,651
Unlike my partner, who kept
a huge secret about my life from me.

670
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:23,112
And now that you know,
it's hurt you, Detective,

671
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,573
and, look, I want to fix things,
but you won't let me,

672
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,659
- so what should I have done?
- Hey, guys?

673
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,745
A PA was supposed to be sitting
at the door to Diablo's trailer,

674
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,265
but she got called away
right around the time he was murdered.

675
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:36,042
Great, so whoever called her away
could be the murderer. Who was it?

676
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,544
Second AD called her away.

677
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:38,837
Well, the second it is.

678
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,713
But he got the message
from the first AD...

679
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:41,673
The first.

680
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,091
...who was passing on the message

681
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,174
that the AD needed to be on set
in the first place.

682
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,778
For Dad's sake, who put in the request?

683
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,843
More importantly, who was smart enough
to launder it through multiple people?

684
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:50,890
Keri Belwood.

685
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,641
The second on the show.

686
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:55,812
Great.

687
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,440
[woman] <i>Re-casting is not
such a crazy idea.</i>

688
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,026
<i>He's the Devil, right?
He could change how he looks.</i>

689
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,112
<i>We've got a good relationship
with Ice Cube,</i>

690
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,989
<i>so maybe we could talk to his agent...</i>

691
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:08,867
Please tell me you're here
to put me out of my misery.

692
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,243
Could be, yes.

693
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,954
Why did you take the PA
off Diablo's trailer?

694
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,080
I didn't.

695
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,666
I've been on notes calls all day.
You can ask my assistant.

696
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:20,295
The same assistant that provided
your alibi for Matt's brutal stabbing?

697
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,023
Everyone knows you need
to pay your dues in Hollywood,

698
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:26,467
but what kind of promotion do you get
for helping your boss beat murder charges?

699
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,804
You knew exactly how to manipulate
the AD chain to get Diablo alone.

700
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,140
You guys have got to be kidding me.

701
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,850
- [scoffs]
- Why would I kill the star

702
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,476
of what's suddenly my show?

703
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,395
Look what I'm putting up with now.

704
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,105
Hello, what's this?

705
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,358
Research files for cases on the show.

706
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,402
Excuse me, that's private.

707
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,278
[Lucifer] Uh...

708
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,446
Oh!

709
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,657
[laughs]

710
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:53,202
Well, it appears that someone's
been taking their research

711
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,662
a little too seriously.

712
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,247
That is not mine.

713
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,416
- I didn't put that there.
- Really?

714
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,126
Keri Belwood, you're under arrest.

715
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,836
What, are you serious?

716
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,171
This is ridiculous!

717
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,714
[sighs]

718
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,441
I'm trying to say this
from a constructive place.

719
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,988
I can feel your negative vibrations
from across the room, man.

720
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:30,822
Well...

721
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,701
then you should probably move
even further away.

722
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,954
I've just given the detective space
for the moment.

723
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,538
You can give me space forever.

724
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,583
It's just your pain talking.

725
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:47,256
Do you know, of all the ways
you humans try to control your lives,

726
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:51,135
these silly New Age superstitions
are by far the most embarrassing.

727
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:54,555
I should be having a field day watching
you make a fool of yourself like this,

728
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,557
but honestly, Daniel, it just...

729
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,559
it just makes me sad.

730
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:00,936
Okay.

731
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,064
Is it all bullshit?

732
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,024
I don't know.

733
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,567
Maybe.

734
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,695
Probably.

735
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,155
I don't care.

736
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:15,952
'Cause losing Charlotte made me realize...

737
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,497
we have so little control over our lives.

738
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,501
I was so pissed off about it for so long.

739
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:24,584
But this...

740
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,048
It keeps my mind positive,

741
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:30,841
and it helps me.

742
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:34,345
I need every win I can get, man.
We all do.

743
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:36,555
Even you.

744
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:40,809
Daniel...

745
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:46,691
I am lowering my walls
and I'm willing to be reharmonized.

746
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,109
I'll take the bracelet.

747
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:51,320
Wait.

748
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,447
[clears throat] Really?

749
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,740
Oh, yes. Really.

750
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:57,617
You sure?

751
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,995
'Cause you need to want it.

752
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:01,581
- Just give me the damn thing.
- You need to really want it.

753
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,666
[laughs]

754
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:09,421
What is this?

755
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:10,715
Oh...

756
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:14,427
Those are the personal notes
from the actor who played Diablo.

757
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,344
[Dan] Hmm.

758
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,513
He had a fascinating insight
into the character.

759
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:21,642
Some wild theories about self-loathing,
but we can't get it all right.

760
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,769
Oh, that is awful.

761
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,353
"Diablo in Space"?

762
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,481
Oh, truly a great episode.

763
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:27,981
Yeah.

764
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,359
It's such a pity
we'll never get to see it.

765
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:39,701
[Dancer] Coming.

766
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:42,871
Hi.

767
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:46,542
I just thought you'd want to know
that we arrested Keri for the murders.

768
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,002
I wanted to tell you in person.

769
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,128
[sighs]

770
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,173
Thank you, Detective.

771
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,634
I wish I could say I was surprised, but...

772
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,345
Keri never stopped bitching about Matt.

773
00:34:58,596 --> 00:34:59,972
"He cut all my jokes.

774
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,140
He was a hack.

775
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,726
He only let us order Tender Greens
for lunch."

776
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,937
[chuckles] That's actually pretty dead-on.

777
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,020
[Dancer chuckles]

778
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:10,733
Yeah, I just wish I had more motive
why she would want to kill your co-star.

779
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,820
Well, maybe he actually figured it out
that she did it.

780
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:14,945
I mean...

781
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,198
He wasn't the brightest bulb, but...

782
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,951
he was surprisingly insightful.

783
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,079
You two were close. I'm sorry.

784
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:27,250
The thing is, when you're stuck
with someone in a situation

785
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,669
you have absolutely no control over...

786
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,005
I know it sounds silly to a real cop...

787
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,842
but we were partners.

788
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,594
No, it... It doesn't sound silly.

789
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,597
You know, I know
exactly what you're talking about.

790
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:46,060
"I can't believe
you pulled it off, Diablo.

791
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,981
We made it back to Earth piloting
a hijacked space shuttle. Insane!"

792
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,651
"You can say that again, Dancer.

793
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:54,986
A devil in the heavens.

794
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:57,572
But crime, it must be punished."

795
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:01,284
Daniel, the original actor playing Diablo
is dead, not you.

796
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,047
Please, can we just give it a bit of life?

797
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,329
Just set me up for the next line, okay?

798
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,331
Big smile, just have fun with it.

799
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,084
- [Dan clears throat]
- "Another case closed, Diablo.

800
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,586
So does that mean I can...

801
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,963
put my bra back on?"

802
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,299
Oof. Well, it's not Shakespeare, is it?

803
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,592
Oh, what's going on here?

804
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,986
You guys are acting out <i>Diablo</i> episodes

805
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,363
- without me?
- Well, we're trying.

806
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:24,515
"Don't tell him the Devil made you do it."

807
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:26,893
- Huh?
- We won't.

808
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:27,976
Damn.

809
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:30,605
Lucifer, you did so much prep
on your character.

810
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,690
I suppose I'm not surprised, though.

811
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:35,067
No, these are Diablo's notes. Here.

812
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,991
Previously they'd all been
about the character,

813
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,113
but these new ones are just gibberish.
[chuckles]

814
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:42,950
"Yearning equals freedom."
"Weapon equals Baphomet's blade."

815
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,034
[Ella] Yearning?

816
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:47,288
I knew the man was a genius.

817
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,792
These are Diablo's notes on the case!

818
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,129
He was investigating Matt Owen's murder
as well, and look.

819
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,215
"Killer equals number two."

820
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,966
Keri was the show's number two.

821
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,594
I can't believe it,
but he actually solved it!

822
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:04,555
Oh, Diablo,
is there anything you can't do?

823
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,807
But didn't Keri kill Matt to take his job?

824
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,518
I don't think
freedom was the yearning, man.

825
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,395
Yeah, I don't think
Keri killed him at all.

826
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,064
Based on the stab wounds,

827
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:16,734
I was able to confirm that the victims
were killed by someone right-handed,

828
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:19,362
and Keri has repetitive stress injuries
in her wrists.

829
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,988
I mean, it'd be highly unlikely

830
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:24,116
that she could stab someone
with the force that made those wounds,

831
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,910
especially with her non-dominant hand.

832
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:28,162
Well, it says it right here
in black and white.

833
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,206
Diablo was certain
the killer was number two.

834
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,291
Unless he meant someone else.

835
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:37,296
So, this is Diablo's club.

836
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:38,797
Hades,

837
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,175
where Christie Dancer was a stripper

838
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,470
before she joined the police force
to solve her father's murder.

839
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:49,517
Don't worry, one of these bottles,
there is actual booze in it.

840
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:53,938
A little secret from the scenes where
Detective Dancer has to get a confession

841
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,148
with a lap dance.

842
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,441
[chuckles ironically]

843
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,654
- Oh, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

844
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:02,737
Cheers.

845
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:05,865
[Dancer grunts]

846
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,953
- [coughs]
- So how do you do it?

847
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,415
No, no, no. I mean,
the way they write your character.

848
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,668
I mean, she only exists to serve Diablo.

849
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:19,880
So what's the secret to getting up every
day knowing everything you do and say is

850
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,091
only servicing another person?

851
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,176
Do you think there's a secret?

852
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,721
It's literally hell on Earth.

853
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,390
Saying those lines,
wearing those clothes...

854
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:31,434
Thank God it's over.

855
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:33,561
Now I can really push myself.

856
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,438
Okay, there's this film.

857
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:38,065
It's a tiny indie,
but the part is so great.

858
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,401
It's this woman coming back
from Afghanistan,

859
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,445
dealing with her mother's Alzheimer's.

860
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,088
Now that I'm free, I can take the part,

861
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,073
and the director's so collaborative.

862
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,033
I'm sorry.

863
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:49,534
I'm rambling.

864
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,870
No.

865
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,164
No, it's just, um...

866
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:55,791
You said this was an amazing gig

867
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,918
and that you were grateful to have it.

868
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:00,171
That's true.

869
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:03,299
I was, but you gotta move on. [sputtering]

870
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,802
When a gig ends, sometimes it's easier
to focus on the bad.

871
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,096
It's actor stuff. We're crazy.

872
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,681
Yeah, yeah. I totally get it.

873
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:14,060
And now you can showcase your talent
on a show that lets you.

874
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,437
Well, for example,
the impression you did of Keri.

875
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,523
I mean, that was really... really good.
Dead-on.

876
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:21,817
- You think so?
- Yeah.

877
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,528
Yeah, in fact, it would be
nearly impossible

878
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,697
to tell you two apart over the phone.

879
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,374
[panting] Wait.

880
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,457
Okay.

881
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:41,712
I understand killing your showrunner
for holding you back,

882
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:47,385
and I get you hiding the vape cartridge
to frame your co-star, but why...

883
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:51,347
would you kill him when you wanted us
to think he was the murderer?

884
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:55,476
Because that idiot "deduced my yearning"

885
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,603
and figured out what I did!

886
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:00,564
He was honestly sweet, in a dopey way,

887
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:04,819
but I wasn't gonna let him take away
the freedom I almost got myself.

888
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:10,241
I am not spending the next six seasons
with my main prop as a stripper pole!

889
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,661
[Dancer grunts]

890
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,204
[groans]

891
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,001
So, Diablo was right.

892
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,045
The killer was number two,

893
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,797
on the actors' call sheet.

894
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,340
How long have you been here?

895
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:30,136
Long enough to realize you have this
totally handled on your own.

896
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:34,223
As much as I appreciate the effort,
I think I prefer my own club,

897
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:37,435
and I definitely prefer the way
my father made you, Detective.

898
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,105
Though I'm sure your tips
would have been great.

899
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,606
[chuckles]

900
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,025
That wasn't the right joke, was it?

901
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,987
I'm just not finding
the right thing to say.

902
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,321
I'm sorry, Detective.

903
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,116
I wish you'd just tell me what to do.

904
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:54,659
I...

905
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:55,702
[scoffs]

906
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:58,622
I don't know if there is anything
for you to do. I...

907
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:02,877
I thought that I had found someone
who had the answer,

908
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,963
someone who knew how it felt, someone...

909
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,508
who could help me cope with feeling...

910
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,719
so powerless.

911
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,264
But I was wrong.

912
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:31,155
[both laughing]

913
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:38,787
You have mentioned a few times now
that you are worried about going to Hell.

914
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:41,624
What's the problem?

915
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:43,042
I literally grew up there.

916
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,418
I, I turned out fine.

917
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,586
Yeah.

918
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,129
I mean, you're right.

919
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:49,131
You're right. I don't...

920
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,843
It's just some stupid thing humans say.

921
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,178
Mm.

922
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:56,388
But I want to know about you, though.

923
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:57,890
Your...

924
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,809
abandonment issues.

925
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,312
[scoffs] I wouldn't...

926
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:06,357
call them abandonment issues.

927
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,526
They're not issues.

928
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,153
I mean, who cares
if Lucifer left me, right?

929
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,570
[scoffs]

930
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,864
Chloe left me.

931
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:16,200
[sighs]

932
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:24,333
[sobs] Then she left me.

933
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,255
Why did she leave me?

934
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:31,881
Eve?

935
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,011
[sobbing]

936
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:46,772
Ugh! [grunts]

937
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,527
[elevator dings]

938
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,205
[whooshing sound]

939
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:08,501
Huh.

940
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:11,922
I was wondering when you'd show
our face again...

941
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:18,052
brother.

942
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,145
Welcome home.

943
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,148
So...

944
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,360
how do you like the mess I made, Samael?

945
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:34,736
[scoffs]

946
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:38,324
Trying to get under my skin, brother?

947
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:41,702
Well, I hoped turning your life
upside down would do that, but...

948
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:45,080
if all it takes is a name,
maybe I overestimated you.

949
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,667
Wondering why I'm doing all of this?

950
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:49,877
Not particularly.

951
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:53,672
Oh, right, you're so above it. I forgot.

952
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,549
If we could all be as cool as you.

953
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,636
Well, isn't that what this is about,
Michael? Hmm?

954
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:03,474
It's funny how turning my life upside down
actually involved pretending to be me.

955
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:04,725
It worked, didn't it?

956
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:07,227
It's the only trick you ever pulled.

957
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,104
All our lives you wanted everyone to think

958
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,774
that you were the cleverer one,
the big brain, but...

959
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,652
it's only ever been about me,

960
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,779
about trying to be me.

961
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:19,490
[chuckles] You always thought too small.

962
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,201
Not like you, right?

963
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,244
Lucifer the rebel,

964
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:27,081
deciding you can do a better job than Dad?

965
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,042
You know,

966
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:35,798
I wonder how you got
that idea in your head

967
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,341
in the first place.

968
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:41,679
[laughs] Right, that's your play, is it?

969
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,681
Taking credit for my failed rebellion?

970
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,641
By all means, it's yours.

971
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,351
Now, you see, that is the best part.

972
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,270
All I did was plant the idea.

973
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,107
You're the one who chose to do it.

974
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:57,194
You still get to keep
all the blame yourself.

975
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:58,612
[chuckles]

976
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:00,697
[scoffs]

977
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,617
Your lies are so tedious, Michael.

978
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,245
Not as tedious as your denial.

979
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:10,040
'Cause I'm not lying now, brother,

980
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:13,210
and I think, deep down,
you are realizing that.

981
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:17,005
And once you realize that...

982
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:18,924
you're gonna wonder...

983
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:23,512
maybe it wasn't just the rebellion
that was my suggestion.

984
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:25,638
What else?

985
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:30,644
What about your little sexcapade
in the garden, or...

986
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,228
Oh...

987
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:34,398
your vacation here to Earth.

988
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,484
That's impossible.

989
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,568
Mm-mm.

990
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:40,320
It was quite easy, actually.

991
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,322
All it took was a little whisper here,

992
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,491
a carefully orchestrated
coincidence there,

993
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,119
and your pathological self-absorption,
of course.

994
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:48,202
<i>Voilà!</i>

995
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,497
All your idea.

996
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:54,208
Why?

997
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:58,922
Because all our lives,
you thought that you were better than me.

998
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:05,554
The great Lucifer Morningstar,
but you're not, are you?

999
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:08,640
You're just Samael.

1000
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,769
Stop calling me that.

1001
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:12,852
All right.

1002
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:16,148
Why don't I call you
what you know you really are?

1003
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:18,858
Unworthy.

1004
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,447
[Lucifer roars]

1005
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,500
[Lucifer screams]

1006
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,509
[Lucifer yells]

1007
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,429
[Michael muttering]

1008
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,182
[screams in pain]

1009
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:02,985
[Michael choking]

1010
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,637
[Lucifer panting]

1011
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,642
[both panting]

1012
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:50,993
[Michael groaning]

1013
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,255
You may want credit
for my decisions, but...

1014
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:05,924
[panting]

1015
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:10,679
...I'm confident this one is all mine.

1016
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,848
- [Lucifer laughs]
- [Michael screams]

1017
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:23,691
Lucifer.

1018
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:25,818
You okay?

1019
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,071
You look like hell.

1020
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:30,406
Appropriate.

1021
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:32,617
Um...

1022
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,745
So, uh...

1023
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:36,955
the good news is,

1024
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:39,666
I dealt with the Michael problem.

1025
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,878
He won't be impersonating me ever again.

1026
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:47,090
The bad news is that I've discovered...

1027
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:53,764
apparently, he's been manipulating me
since the dawn of time.

1028
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:56,974
Oh.

1029
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,228
Yeah, must be, um...

1030
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:02,229
terrible to...

1031
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,608
not control your own fate.

1032
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:06,944
All right. I get it, Detective.

1033
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:09,321
You're struggling with
feeling like you can't cope.

1034
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:11,448
Well, welcome to the bloody club!

1035
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,867
You have no right to yell at me.

1036
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:16,745
Our situations are nothing alike.

1037
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:18,121
You are an angel.

1038
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:21,917
You deal with celestial craziness
all the time.

1039
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,835
I am just a person, Lucifer.

1040
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,213
Just a person

1041
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:29,967
who was already dealing with the fact
that I'm in love with the Devil,

1042
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,385
and then...

1043
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,680
I find out that I was made...

1044
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,223
to feel that way.

1045
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:41,812
That my life isn't my own,

1046
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:45,565
so I am sorry if your brother is
a jerk to you sometimes.

1047
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,150
[sighs deeply]

1048
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:53,781
I... I...

1049
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:59,913
I spent thousands of years in Hell,
imagining our reunion.

1050
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,208
Getting my partner back, getting...

1051
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:07,754
Getting you back. And now...

1052
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:11,674
I...

1053
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:17,723
I just thought it would go differently.

1054
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,477
Yeah. [sniffles]

1055
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:24,854
Me, too.

1056
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:29,276
I thought what we had was real.

1057
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:33,612
[scoffs]

1058
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,261
Decker! You home?

1059
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,598
Come on, it's 9:30.

1060
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,850
Even you can't be in bed.

1061
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:02,934
[man] She's not here.

1062
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:06,563
She left quite abruptly, actually.

1063
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,106
She was quite upset.

1064
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,232
Oh.

1065
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:14,488
I suppose you're the person
I wanted to talk to, anyway.

1066
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:17,824
I wanted to say that...

1067
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,203
that I'm sorry.

1068
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:23,955
I shouldn't have tried to stab you.

1069
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:28,376
Turns out you weren't the one
I was upset with to begin with.

1070
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,960
Really?

1071
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:32,047
You're not upset with Lucifer?

1072
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,009
Well...

1073
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:38,845
you should be.

1074
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:46,436
Well, this night turned out
better than expected.

1075
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,064
Now I get to cut out your lying tongue.

1076
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,359
You were right. You were right.

1077
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:56,613
I'm a liar, and Lucifer always
tells the truth, doesn't he?

1078
00:51:57,697 --> 00:52:00,534
Oh, yeah, except for when
he leaves things out.

1079
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:03,870
Like the secret that he kept from Chloe,

1080
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:07,082
and the one that he's keeping from you.

1081
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:12,754
What secret?

1082
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:13,672
Mm-mm.

1083
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:14,755
Uh-uh.

1084
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,508
I can't tell you that.

1085
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:18,718
You won't believe me...

1086
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:21,304
'cause I'm a liar, right?

1087
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:25,266
But...

1088
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,855
I can tell you how to find it out
for yourself.
