a commander of the Red 2 Mars Project,

Judy was the only scientist.

The other five were just civilians

for a spot on the Red Planet.

to take them to be the first Mars colony.

if tests go according to plan.

in or out of the dome,

00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,090

You said you had to take over
the family business.

103
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,345
Indeed. My mother was ill, which is why
I had to take over the business.

maybe even improved.

122

but Lucifer's acting...

148
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,211
um, different.

149
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,379
Different how?

150
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,338
I don't know.

151
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,758
I'm sure it has nothing to do
with the fact that I told him I loved him

152
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:51,304
right before he left,
and he didn't exactly say it back.

153
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,972
But he did say...

154
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,556
[sighs]

155
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,809
"It was you, Chloe.

156
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,060
It was always you,"

157
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,564
which is kind of a big deal
because he used my name,

158
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,982
which is something he never does.

159
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:07,069
So I'm pretty sure he's not acting weird
because I freaked him out or anything.

160
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,072
Well... I think

161
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,326
if Lucifer's been acting unusually,

162
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,496
it's probably because he's been in,
well, you know...

163
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,164
Hell.

164
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,624
- Yeah.
- Although it may have been

165
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,334
a couple of months for us...

166
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,004
he's told me that
time's not the same there,

167
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,466
so it might have been
thousands of years for him.

168
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:31,135
Yes. He, um... He told me that, too.

169
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:32,802
Um...

170
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,013
Unless he's lying.

171
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:34,931
Yeah, right.

172
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,224
At least we know that

173
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,518
that's something he never does, right?
[chuckles]

174
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,061
Uh...

175
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,395

Well, actually, this morning, um,

177
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:51,113
I found out that Lucifer has
reconsidered his position on honesty.

00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,207
Well, I'm sure whatever
Lucifer is going through,

182
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,086
it has nothing to do with you
or his feelings for you.

183
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,381
He probably just needs time
to reacclimate.

184
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,550
You know, remember...

185
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,803
what his life is like here.

186
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,262
Right.

187
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,224
Yes. Yeah. Yes, that...

188
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,684
You're so right, that's it.

189
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,978
I just have to, to remind him

190
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,188
of who he was when he was on Earth,

191
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,792
and then give him a little jump start.

192
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:28,025
That's exactly it. Thank you, Linda.

193
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,110
You're a genius.

194
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,405
You two are perfect for each other.

195
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:33,488
[chuckles]

196
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,990
Maybe.

197
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,286
So there's five
Red 2 Mars Project members.

198
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,769
We just have to figure out
which one had motive to kill Judy.

199
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,623
Yes, interrogation. I remember it well.

200
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,417
Crucial to the crime-solving process.

201
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,544
Well, and it can be boring,
but you'll make it fun.

202
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,170
You always do. That's who you are.

203
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:51,716
Right, let's get down to serious business,
shall we?

204
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:53,717
You, uh...

205
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,261
You hated Judy, didn't you?

206
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,930
Well, I didn't exactly love the woman.

207
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,725
Fact is, Judy was a piggy little thief,

208
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,643
always stealing our food rations.

209
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,769
Well... [chuckles]

210
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,355
...the stomach wants
what the stomach wants, am I right?

211
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,150
I mean, we all have desires, right?

212
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,528
I wonder what... what she desires.

213
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,865
Well, probably just to eat her own food.
She just said it.

214
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,035
Did Judy do anything else
that you found aggravating?

215
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,870
Yeah, actually.

216
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,040
She totally bugged out
when I microdosed this one day.

217
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:28,377
I mean, I'm going to want to trip
when I take my trip, right?

218
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,503
That reminds me.

219
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:33,174
You left this at my desk.

220
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,468
- Detective!
- [mouthing] You want?

221
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,094
It's not even noon.

222
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:42,391
Yes, I can see how that behavior
might grate on one's nerves.

223
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,852
Oh, I don't know.
She never really bothered me.

224
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:47,021
She was a bit loud
on the sat phone sometimes.

225
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,606
Other than that, nice lady.

226
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:49,774
You're lying!

227
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,526
Mm. No,

228
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,736
I'm not.

229
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,405
[whispering]
I'm sorry, did you want to do that?

230
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,489
No.

231
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,832
There must be something
you're not telling us.

232
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,369
[woman] Not to speak ill of the dead,

233
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,288
but Judy was a bit of a party pooper.

234
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:08,918
We had about five books
the entire time we were in there,

235
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,879
and she managed to spoil
the endings to all of them.

236
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,548
Yeah? What'd you do,
bite the head off a bat?

237
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,842
Stab her in her sorry space ass?

238
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,386
Huh, Sharon?

239
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:22,264
Actually, that was my husband
that bit the head of a bat.

240
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,475
Oh, come on! You're lying.

241
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:27,645
I apologize for my partner.
That was very unprofessional.

242
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:28,728
It's quite all right.

243
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:33,359
By the way, I never managed to thank you
for all the things you did for Ozzy.

244
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:36,737
From one Prince of Darkness
to another, right? [laughs]

245
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,406
Yes. Well done.

246
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,409
So other than the books, you liked Judy?

247
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,785
Yeah. Totally.

248
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,954
Everybody did, especially the guys.

249
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:45,913
- Oh.
- Mm.

250
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,290
I mean, she was so hot,
and smart, of course.

251
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,335
But she's not the only one
who knew about science.

252
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,921
Did you know that I engineered
five of my fragrances myself?

253
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,048
The fruit scents
are slightly controversial,

254
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,551
but everyone loved my melons. [laughs]

255
00:11:58,634 --> 00:11:59,802
[Chloe] Mm-hmm.

256
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:00,928
[laughs]

257
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,388
Oh... Really?

258
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:03,931
Nothing?

259
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,474
At least hit on her.

260
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,558
Why would I do that?

261
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,145
- She might be a murderer.
- Wait. I didn't kill Judy.

262
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,646
I'd never hurt Judy.

263
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,733
- I am certainly not a murderer.
<i>- </i>Dude, I didn't kill her.

264
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:15,901
Is this cinnamon?

265
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:21,615
No, I did not stab her
in her "sorry space ass."

266
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,325
[groans] Dearie me!

267
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:25,953
That got us nowhere.

268
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,289
Yeah, tell me about it.

269
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,876
Hey, what's going on with you?
Are you okay?

270
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,629
Of course. Everything's fine.

271
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,715
Don't you want to do something impulsive,

272
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,259
inappropriate, sinful, you know?

273
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,386
Like... What... [grunts]

274
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,181
Here, eat this.

275
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,099
Well, I'm not really hungry.

276
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,601
That's not why you eat it.

277
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:49,602
- Looks like...
- Hey.

278
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:50,685
Hi.

279
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,481
Hey, is that my pudding?

280
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,775
Yes! Yes, here you go, Daniel. Yummy.

281
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,777
Okay.

282
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,238
[sniffs] What's your game?

283
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,616
Nothing, just thought
you looked a bit peckish.

284
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,699
Uh-huh.

285
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,618
Mm-hmm.

286
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:10,872
Did you spit in it?

287
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:12,707
He spit in it.

288
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,668
Got something, kids.

289
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,712
That hair I found
in the bloody boot print,

290
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,922
it's sheep hair.

291
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,883
Now, unless someone
was into some freaky stuff...

292
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:21,966
Don't even say it.

293
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,384
I won't.

294
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:28,224
It means that someone tracked that hair in
from outside the dome.

295
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,601
Oh, well, that is exciting!

296
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,603
Well done, Miss Lopez.

297
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,773
Right, I'd say it's time to go and talk
to the people running the program.

298
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,274
Genius!

299
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:40,444
Oh, God, it's so great to have Lucifer
back again, isn't it?

300
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,570
Mm-hmm.

301
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,666
[Lucifer] So we understand
no one was allowed

302
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,909
in or out of the facility,

303
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,745
but people must have come to the dome
to drop off supplies, yes?

304
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,704
Uh, no, actually.

305
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,790
The whole point is
to simulate a real trip to Mars,

306
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:56,544
so no one's going to swing by when you're
just, you know, 33 million miles away.

307
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,045
And what about repairs?

308
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:01,590
Again, all maintenance has to be done
on site, although that's minimal, too.

309
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,677
We've made a lot of improvements
from the first project to Red 2.

310
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,480
We're less concerned
about equipment failure

311
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,055
than we are of people breaking down.

312
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,139
And what does that mean?

313
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,101
One of the main reasons
why we're running these simulations

314
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,603
is to test the psychological strength
of our travelers.

315
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:18,691
It's difficult to be isolated
with strangers for so long,

316
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:21,402
away from your family, friends,
everyone you love.

317
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,029
Yeah. I participated
in the Red 1 Mars Project.

318
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,490
I can tell you firsthand,
the experience really...

319
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,616
changes a person.

320
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,494
But once you were back for a while,

321
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,038
did you start to feel
more like yourself, or...

322
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,126
To tell you the truth, I'm not sure.
I'm not sure if I'll ever be the same.

323
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,504
Well, it must have been particularly hard
on your relationships.

324
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,299
Detective,

325
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:49,013
didn't one of the crew members mention
that Judy was loud on the phone?

326
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,936
Perhaps she was arguing with someone
back home.

327
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:51,807
[woman] Doubtful.

328
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,560
The sat phones are just used
for project communications.

329
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,770
They're only connected to the system here.

330
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,106
Well, did anyone here
have issues with Judy, then?

331
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,567
[sighs] What about Donovan?

332
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,561
- Who?
- An aerospace engineer

333
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:04,945
who used to work here.

334
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,948
But when Judy got promoted
to project commander of Red 2 over him,

335
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:08,866
he got pissed.

336
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,619
He went to Brody, he threw a fit,
so Brody fired him.

337
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,786
Donovan was kind of...

338
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,205
- emotional when he left.
- Mm-hmm.

339
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:16,957
- Oh, was he?
- [Chloe] Huh.

340
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:18,791
Okay.

341
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,501
[Lucifer sighs]

342
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:23,671
Detective, I...

343
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,593
I could tell the questions you were asking
certainly weren't just about the case.

344
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,347
You're concerned that I have changed.

345
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,265
Well, the truth is...

346
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,558
I have.

347
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,481
But I need you to know
that my feelings for you...

348
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,650
haven't.

349
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,653
[Chloe sighs]

350
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,655
You've already been so patient.

351
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,907
I just ask that you give me
a little more time.

352
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,617
Of course.

353
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:53,994
Whatever you need.

354
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,414
[sighs] Thank you.

355
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,594
[elevator dings]

356
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,141
[distorted chiming]

357
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,189
[Lucifer grunting]

358
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,899
[choking]

359
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:06,983
How could you?

360
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,112
After everything
we've been through, Lucifer,

361
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,613
how could you go home without me?

362
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,116
[in American accent]
I'm not Lucifer! I'm not Lucifer!

363
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,453
I'm not Lucifer! [grunting]

364
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,121
[gasping]

365
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,002
[panting]

366
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,212
Lucifer told me he had a twin brother.

367
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,133
And you are Mazikeen.

368
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,596
Nice to meet you.

369
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,222
I'm Michael.

370
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,353
"Michael," huh?

371
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,316
How do I know you're not Lucifer
saying you're Michael

372
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,151
just so I won't kick your ass?

373
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,695
Lucifer doesn't lie, remember?

374
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,033
[chuckles]

375
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,421
Do these look like Lucifer's wings to you?

376
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,220
Fine. What the hell are you doing here?

377
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:21,725
To right a very serious wrong.

378
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,771
See, there I am in the Silver City,
doing my thing,

379
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,732
when Gabriel strolls in and says,

380
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,692
"Lucifer went back to Hell,

381
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,944
voluntarily."

382
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,739
Well, I just crack up,
as you can imagine, but...

383
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:40,244
then Raphael starts going off
about how Lucifer's grown,

384
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:43,205
and then Remy says,
"Yeah, what a sacrifice,"

385
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:47,417
and then pretty soon all I hear is,
"Lucifer, Lucifer, Lucifer!"

386
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,837
So you're jealous?

387
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,587
No.

388
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,173
I'm pissed.

389
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:57,261
Lucifer finally does
what he's supposed to do

390
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,555
without whining about it,
and he gets praised?

391
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,224
He rebelled against Dad.

392
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,476
Almighty God, for God's sake.

393
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,521
Since when do we congratulate a convict
for serving a sentence?

394
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:12,234
And if I know my eternally
selfish brother, and I do,

395
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:16,530
all this sacrifice and responsibility
bullshit, it's just smoke and mirrors.

396
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,658
I don't know who he's trying to fool,
but I do know...

397
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:24,371
that as soon as he hears someone is
up here playing with his toys...

398
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,749
maybe even breaking a few,

399
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:32,296
then he will come flying right back up
to reveal his true colors.

400
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:33,714
So...

401
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:36,049
[sighs deeply]

402
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,969
[in English accent] Hello, Los Angeles.

403
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,224
Seems to me you're the only one
trying to fool people.

404
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,642
Good luck with that.

405
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,769
Humans are smart.

406
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,980
Especially Chloe Decker.

407
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,532
[in American accent]
I admit, she was getting

408
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,193
a little suspicious, but...

409
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,946
I'll just up my Lucifer game
until she's properly hooked,

410
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,533
and then I will achy-break
her little heart.

411
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,704
Do you even know how to be Lucifer?

412
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,624
Know anything about Earth? Humans?

413
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,501
I pay attention, Miss Mazikeen.

414
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,213
I know a lot of things.

415
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:17,883
And what makes you think I will let you
get away with any of this?

416
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,426
Well, why wouldn't you?

417
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,889
Why wouldn't you even help me?

418
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,140
Hmm?

419
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,853
I told you, I know things,

420
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:33,732
and I know that you're pissed
at my brother.

421
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,318
Join me.

422
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:41,240
Lure him back up here, and then
you can kick the real Lucifer's ass.

423
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,119
Or you could just keep beating up pianos.

424
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:47,871
It's your choice.

425
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,209
[sighs]

426
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,378
[electronic dance music playing]

427
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,130
[indistinct chatter]

428
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,384
- [in English accent] Hello, brother.
- Hey, Lucy.

429
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:01,884
Lucy!

430
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,469
You're here!

431
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,099
[laughs]

432
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,308
Wait.

433
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,228
You're here.

434
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:15,065
Yes. Yes, I got a bit bored,
so I thought I'd pop back up.

435
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,276
Anyway, I'll see you later.

436
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,610
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!

437
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,571
I'm going to need just a little bit more
information than that, brother.

438
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,157
Like, for instance, who's watching Hell?

439
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,826
No one, but don't worry.

440
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,661
They've promised to be
good little demons.

441
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,747
I left them a cheese plate
and put on some cartoons.

442
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,583
You're being awfully glib.

443
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,544
I'm always glib, brother.

444
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,258
Look, I know what this is about.

445
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,593
You're afraid for baby Charlie, right?

446
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,472
Yes, Lucy, of course I am.

447
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,309
What's to stop more demons from coming up
and taking my son again?

448
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,728
I went back to Hell for a reason.

449
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,022
I was concerned, too, but I'm not anymore.

450
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,441
Everyone's in line, trust me.

451
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:14,166
All right, so, DMV lists this
as Donovan Glover's most recent address.

452
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,543
If he goes to Mars,
they're never going to find Waldo.

453
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,463
[both laughing]

454
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,425
You know, you seem more like
your regular self tonight.

455
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,761
- Do I?
- Mm-hmm.

456
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:33,852
Donovan Glover?

457
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:38,856
[Chloe] LAPD!

458
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,400
Oh. [grunts]

459
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,069
I don't believe he heard you.

460
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,781
[tires squealing]

461
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,241
He's headed for the bridge.

462
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,098
- But if you head west...
- We can cut him off.

463
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:55,248
You read my mind.

464
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,209
[tires squealing]

465
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,175
Well done, Detective.

466
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,985
[Michael laughing]

467
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:31,910
[brakes squeal]

468
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:33,787
Oh!

469
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,287
Come on.

470
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,126
Oh! [grunts]

471
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,261
LAPD! Get out of the car!

472
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,180
[engine revs]

473
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,227
[tires squeal]

474
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,109
- [gun firing]
- [Donovan grunts]

475
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,253
[gasps]

476
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:24,962
Well!

477
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,257
That was fun. [chuckles]

478
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,509
[sighs]

479
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,011
[chuckles]

480
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,014
[Donovan] I thought you were repo men.

481
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,599
And woman.

482
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,017
Sorry I freaked.

483
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,019
It's just, that car is all I got left.

484
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:41,521
Well, perhaps you shouldn't have
freaked on your boss Brody

485
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:42,689
and gotten yourself fired.

486
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:43,857
Oh, you know about that?

487
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,317
Well, he kind of deserved it.

488
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,861
He gave a promotion to someone
way less qualified than me.

489
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,237
You're referring to poor Judy.

490
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,031
[Chloe] The woman you stabbed in the neck.

491
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:54,409
Wait, are you saying Judy's dead?

492
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,827
Very.

493
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,579
And you think I did it?

494
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,624
No. No way.

495
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,043
First of all, I've been in Texas
all week, interviewing.

496
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,419
Just got back last night.

497
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,755
Second, I never touched that woman.

498
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,840
Bad enough Brody blacklisted me.

499
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,967
Who knows what he'd do
if anyone hurt his Judy?

500
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,052
"His" Judy?

501
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,135
Yeah.

502
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,888
They were having an affair.

503
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,765
Why do you think she got the job over me?

504
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:20,227
Boss can't even follow his own
"No fraternizing at work" rule.

505
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,396
Brody's married.

506
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,240
Perhaps Judy got tired
of being the mistress.

507
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,525
Explains the angry phone calls.

508
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,276
Brody got scared his wife would find out.

509
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,571
Yeah, made sure she wouldn't.
He has access to Mission Control.

510
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,324
And the ability to delete
the surveillance footage.

511
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,743
Yes. We have to go talk to Brody.

512
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,453
Yes, we do.

513
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:40,496
Thank you.

514
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,458
And, uh, you're never gonna be
Ryan Gosling, by the way.

515
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,549
Hey.

516
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,260
What are you doing?

517
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,721
I'm literally doing nothing.

518
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,349
You never do nothing.

519
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,643
Something is definitely up.

520
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,146
Hi. So I figured out
why we can't get a hold of Brody.

521
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,230
He's dead?

522
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,817
- Not Heaven. Space.
- Ah.

523
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,945
Turns out he's on a suborbital
shuttle test until tomorrow morning.

524
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:14,072
So, you know...

525
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,533
That means that you and I...

526
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,286
have the rest of the evening free.

527
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,415
Right.

528
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:27,294
Right, well, I suppose I'll go home
and get some dinner, then.

529
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,004
All on my lonesome.

530
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:31,881
I'll see you later, Detective.

531
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:34,466
Ah.

532
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:36,720
Um... was that an invitation?

533
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:38,846
Don't ask me.

534
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,474
The guy's a freaking enigma.

535
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:43,518
Mm.

536
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:51,233
[elevator dings]

537
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:56,947
Lucifer.

538
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,493
I brought our favorite.

539
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,163
Burgers and fries.

540
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,627
Detective.

541
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,923
Detective! Wait!

542
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,470
Detective, please.

543
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,220
Detective...

544
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,016
Please! Please.

545
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,602
- Let me explain.
- Maze?

546
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,061
Maze?

547
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,689
You are acting so different.

548
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:32,067
I am trying to be patient, Lucifer.

549
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,943
- Understanding, but no...
- Detective...

550
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,238
No. Leave me alone. I...

551
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,116
I don't even know who you are anymore.

552
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:43,285
You're right.

553
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,916
Honestly, I'm not even sure
who I am anymore.

554
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,878
I mean, I was down there for so long,
I got lost,

555
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,546
lost in who I used to be.

556
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,675
And I have been trying so hard
to get back to the Lucifer I was,

557
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:59,219
the Lucifer that you know,

558
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:00,636
but...

559
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,640
When I saw Maze,
Hell just came rushing back.

560
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:05,892
Chloe,

561
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,268
it meant nothing.

562
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:10,146
You are the only thing that matters to me.

563
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,314
[scoffs]

564
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,109
Oh, yeah?

565
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,738
How do I know that you're not lying?

566
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,367
'Cause you do that now, yeah? You lie.

567
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,450
Not to you.

568
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:25,994
You're different.

569
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,915
I would never lie to you.

570
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,543
[elevator dings]

571
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:37,173
Yeah, well, I need to go.

572
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,384
I need... I need to think.

573
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,593
Wha... Detective!

574
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:50,437
[man] Nothing inspires
like a suborbital view.

575
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,064
Except, of course,
maybe one from the Red Planet.

576
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,607
And let me tell you something.

577
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,402
Jeff Bezos can Bezos our butt!

578
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:59,112
[crowd laughing]

579
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,072
But this mission,

580
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,241
it brings us one step closer...

581
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,761
- Detective, about last night...
- I don't want to talk about it.

582
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,412
...to making that dream come true.

583
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:08,371
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

584
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,582
[man] I couldn't be prouder.
And let me tell you...

585
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:13,042
- Mr. Brody, do you have a minute to talk?
- I'm sorry,

586
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,896
if you guys wouldn't mind just
hanging back with the rest of the press.

587
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,921
Wait a sec.

588
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:18,131
I know you.

589
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,176
Yeah.

590
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,430
You're that guy who helped me
find forgiveness.

591
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,266
Yes, I am.

592
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,476
How are you?

593
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,186
- Thanks again, man.
- Heh.

594
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,271
Oh, it was very cool of you.

595
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:34,856
Thanks again, man.

596
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,609
That was really great of you...

597
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:38,692
Ooh.

598
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,654
I'm devastated over Judy's death.

599
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:42,614
Just sick.

600
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,657
No one expects to lose an employee
like that.

601
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,326
We know you were sleeping with her.

602
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,412
An accomplished woman,

603
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,426
maybe she didn't want to be
the side piece,

604
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,858
maybe she didn't like sharing you.

605
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:56,544
Yes, perhaps she threatened
to tell your wife, or the public.

606
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,214
Uh... do I need a lawyer?

607
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,758
No one had more access to the dome,
to the cameras.

608
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:04,052
Right now,
no one has more motive than you.

609
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,096
You know, I'd say
I definitely need a lawyer.

610
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,411
[whispering] So right now might be
a good time to do your thing.

611
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,687
My what?

612
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:15,897
The mojo, with the eyes.

613
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,816
Oh! Right, yes, that.

614
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,568
Mr. Brody. Sorry, one last question.

615
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,278
Get the car running.

616
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:26,615
Tell me...

617
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,452
What is it that you

618
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:30,787
truly fear?

619
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,210
I...

620
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,255
I'm afraid...

621
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,089
that...

622
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,259
people will find out.

623
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,135
That you killed Judy?

624
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,096
No.

625
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,016
That I hate space.

626
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:53,726
[Brody sighs]

627
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,187
This astronaut crap
scares the hell out of me!

628
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:59,899
I just started the Mars Project
to compete with Bezos and Musk.

629
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,943
It was a goddamn publicity stunt.

630
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,736
So you don't want to go to Mars?

631
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,738
That's why you're a sweaty little Betty?

632
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,950
- I get carsick, for God's sake.
- Aww.

633
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,618
I almost passed out in the simulation.

634
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,454
How am I supposed to rocket my ass
to fricking Mars?

635
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,456
Did Judy know it was all a sham?

636
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,167
Not at first. She found out
when she was in the dome, actually.

637
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:21,921
Called me, pissed,
threatening to tell everyone, the press.

638
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,885
Well, even more reason for you
to want her dead.

639
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:25,173
No, no, no.

640
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:26,926
I talked her down,

641
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,822
told her I had no choice now
but to go through with the trip.

642
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,347
So, we made up.

643
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:34,642
I'm telling you,
I had nothing to do with her death.

644
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,436
Do you have an alibi for three nights ago?

645
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,520
I was home all night,

646
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,022
vomiting my guts out,

647
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,705
'cause the following morning,
I had to get in that stupid tin can.

648
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,192
Well, can anyone corroborate?

649
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,444
[sighs]

650
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,030
I guess not.

651
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,658
Yeah, I... I'm not saying anything else
without my lawyer.

652
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,492
[Brody sighs]

653
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:54,828
[Chloe sighs]

654
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,081
I thought we were friends.

655
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,169
Dan, hi.

656
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,295
So Brody's lawyered up.

657
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,964
We can't do anything
without more evidence, all right?

658
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,008
Yeah, I'm headed back now.

659
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,800
I, uh...

660
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,929
I upset you even more back there,
didn't I?

661
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,889
When I asked him what he truly feared.

662
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:13,972
Uh...

663
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,142
Actually, Lucifer, uh...

664
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,061
just the opposite.

665
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,730
I think it helped me understand.

666
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,024
I've never been to Hell,

667
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,777
and I hope I never will,
but from what you've told me...

668
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,113
it's a truly terrible place,

669
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,574
and if it really was
thousands of years for you,

670
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,452
no wonder dishonesty and fear
followed you back.

671
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,289
I mean, yes, you've changed,

672
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:42,043
but it would be so strange if you hadn't.

673
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,338
I think it's time that I accept that.

674
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,048
[exhales]

675
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:52,804
See you at the precinct?

676
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,639
Right.

677
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,099
Okay.

678
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,315
[sighs]

679
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:07,192
I told you.

680
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,406
- Tequila upsets his stomach.
- [laughs]

681
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,449
- Hey, Linda.
- Hi.

682
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,618
- Is it noon already?
- [chuckles] Yeah.

683
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,745
You know, I meant to call you, uh...

684
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,373
Just wondering if it might be okay

685
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:23,126
if I kept little Charlie here
for one more night.

686
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,627
Aren't you working?

687
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,871
Yeah, but there's no better place
for this little angel

688
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,756
than right here, strapped to me.

689
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,217
Amenadiel,

690
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,970
when's the last time you put Charlie down?

691
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:36,723
It's not that long, 15, 16 hours, maybe?

692
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:38,833
Okay, Amenadiel, give me the baby.

693
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,311
Okay...

694
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:43,895
What's wrong?

695
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,273
[Charlie coos]

696
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,691
Okay, listen.

697
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,985
I don't want to worry you,
all right? But, um...

698
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,195
Lucifer's back.

699
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,572
Okay, yeah, Chloe told me. So?

700
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,073
"So?"

701
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,701
So he's not in Hell.
He's not watching the demons.

702
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:59,871
But Lucifer wouldn't come back
unless everything was okay, right?

703
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,458
I suppose. He said as much.

704
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,002
And it's Lucifer, he doesn't lie.

705
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,548
What is it?

706
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:18,431
Uh... no, it's just that Chloe told me
that apparently, since he's been back...

707
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,893
Lucifer <i>has </i>started lying.

708
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:23,894
What?

709
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,190
Surely he wouldn't lie
about something like this.

710
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,565
Yeah.

711
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:29,734
Right.

712
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,527
No, of course, you're right...

713
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,828
We shouldn't let our fears
get the best of us.

714
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,366
Okay. Come here, baby.

715
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,910
[Charlie coos]

716
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,162
[Maze] Decker.

717
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,339
Hey.

718
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:53,673
So, uh...

719
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,259
You freaking out?

720
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,095
I mean, seeing me and Lucifer together...

721
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,805
Maze, I know what you're trying to do.

722
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:02,016
- You do?
- Yeah, and you suck at it.

723
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,434
- I do?
- Yeah.

724
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:04,352
Oh, yeah.

725
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:08,272
You're trying to apologize
in your very awkward, demon way.

726
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,734
I am? [chuckles]

727
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:13,736
Look... [sighs]

728
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:15,905
...I was pissed.

729
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:18,300
It was devastating walking in on you
and Lucifer like that.

730
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,324
It was.

731
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,744
But I know that you're...

732
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,371
[sighs deeply]

733
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,456
You know, you're in a vulnerable place
right now.

734
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,540
You're lonely.

735
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,417
You're missing Eve.

736
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:33,172
And it helped me to understand
that Lucifer is also hurting, too.

737
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:37,385
He's desperate for love and affection,
deeply desperate.

738
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,471
I mean, obviously, if he was gonna
reach out to you.

739
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:45,768
It also made me realize that
I want to be the one who is there for him.

740
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:47,936
In every way.

741
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:53,234
In fact, I think it's time for us to take
our relationship to the next level.

742
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,028
Are you saying you're gonna bone him?

743
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,321
I mean...

744
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:01,701
Hopefully it's, like,
a little more romantic than that.

745
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,452
But yeah, um...

746
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,746
I think we've waited long enough.

747
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,630
[snoring]

748
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,141
Aragorn, that's not your sword.

749
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,978
I'm... I'm totally awake. I'm awake.

750
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,065
I think it's time
to go get some coffee, Lucifer.

751
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:42,950
[both chuckle]

752
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,349
[both chuckle]

753
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,268
[both chuckle]

754
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:14,439
That's good.

755
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,569
Mm.

756
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:23,531
Mm.

757
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,996
You know, I am hungry.

758
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,750
Do you want anything
from the vending machine?

759
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,294
Oh, shoot.

760
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,296
I, um, forgot my money.

761
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:42,051
- Do you mind if...
- [quivering breaths]

762
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,015
- [trembling breaths]
- [Chloe sighs]

763
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,852
[chuckling exhale]

764
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:56,607
[Chloe exhales deeply]

765
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:59,944
- [exhales sharply]
- So, um... what do you think?

766
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,779
You want your favorite? The, uh...

767
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,073
The ranch puffs, or...

768
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,617
- Uh...
- ...maybe something different?

769
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:12,873
You know, I've been thinking.

770
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,084
You are different,

771
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:18,045
but sometimes change is a good thing.

772
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,880
You know, I...

773
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,884
I think I like this new Lucifer.

774
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,012
You've grown.

775
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:35,354
I've been stuck in
an old version of us, and, uh...

776
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:40,860
maybe it's time for me
to move forward, or...

777
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,863
for us to move forward together.

778
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:45,822
[Michael gulps]

779
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,701
How about after we solve this case, I...

780
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,287
I come over to your place?

781
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:53,913
Okay.

782
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,341
Oh, look at us.

783
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,344
Yes.

784
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,430
It's rather lovely, isn't it?

785
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:11,973
[gasps]

786
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,851
Maybe there's a reflection.

787
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,270
Excuse me.

788
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:20,857
Reflection...

789
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,028
Lucifer.

790
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:28,698
Lucifer?

791
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,036
Oh, Dr. Linda Martin! Hello.

792
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,371
So it's true.

793
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:34,872
Here you are. [chuckles]

794
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,457
- Yes.
- That's great.

795
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,792
You must be so happy.

796
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,418
Everyone must be so...

797
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:40,836
Who's watching Hell?

798
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,005
What? Oh, don't worry about that.
It's fine.

799
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:46,717
Uh, yeah, because the last time
Hell was left unattended,

800
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,511
demons came and grabbed my baby,

801
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:50,930
so I'm going to need a little more than
"It's fine."

802
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,893
Yes, I understand,
you're afraid for your child.

803
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:55,935
Yeah, I'm not afraid he's gonna
fall off the swings, Lucifer.

804
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,104
Do you not remember what happened?

805
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,524
They took Charlie.

806
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,734
They tried to take him to Hell.

807
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,069
That's a big deal.

808
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,781
So of course I'm going to be afraid
for my child.

809
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,825
I need to keep this baby safe.

810
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:17,123
Yes, I understand.

811
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,375
You're afraid for your baby, but...

812
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,878
it's more than that, isn't it?

813
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:27,758
You're afraid of being a bad mother,
aren't you?

814
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:31,679
And why do I get the feeling...

815
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,473
you have a good reason for that?

816
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,358
But don't worry.
Hell's being looked after, I promise you.

817
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,447
And the more I think about it,

818
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,824
the more it might just stay that way.

819
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,666
[Chloe sighs]

820
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:03,069
Can you go to the moment
right before the cameras shut off?

821
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,127
Mm-hmm.

822
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:05,712
Mm.Nada.

823
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,131
Oh.

824
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,215
Fast-forward a bit.

825
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,050
Keep going, keep going.

826
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,094
More... There. Freeze.

827
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:13,929
Oh, my gosh.

828
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,764
You're right. There's a reflection.

829
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,392
Whoever killed Judy

830
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,729
only wiped the camera footage
from the time they stepped into frame.

831
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,939
They didn't even think
about their reflection.

832
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:26,692
Ack. I can't see their face, though.

833
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,375
Is there a way to tell whose suit it is?

834
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,004
[Ella] It's none of them. Look. I mean,

835
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,989
that one has an external oxygen tube,

836
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:35,201
but the ones from the Red 2 Mars Project,
look, nada.

837
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:36,827
Those must be built into the suit.

838
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,830
Do you think the change
would be considered an improvement?

839
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,165
Definitely, yeah.

840
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,959
Okay. I might have an idea
of where the old suit came from.

841
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,628
- Lucifer?
- Mm.

842
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:46,711
Let's go.

843
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,130
- Right. Right.
- Yeah.

844
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,934
Well, it's late. We should probably
just come back tomorrow morning.

845
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:02,977
[lock breaks]

846
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,481
Lucifer, we don't even have a warrant.

847
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:07,106
Huh.

848
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:09,651
[Chloe sighs]

849
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,082
Lucifer.

850
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,084
Lucifer.

851
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:28,629
Where are you?

852
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,933
[sighs] Nothing.

853
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,016
Well, let's go.

854
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,560
[gun cocks]

855
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:49,984
[gun fires]

856
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:54,153
[gun fires]

857
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:56,407
[gun cocks]

858
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:57,700
Sam Chavez!

859
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,035
LAPD! Hold your fire!

860
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:01,494
LAPD?

861
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,247
Oh, my God. Thank God.

862
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,167
- [Chloe] Drop the gun.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

863
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,715
You're under arrest
for the murder of Judy Mason.

864
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:13,799
Wait a minute, what?

865
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:16,719
No, no. I didn't kill Judy.
Anders Brody did.

866
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:20,240
That's who I thought you were.
That's why I shot at you.

867
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,766
And you know Brody killed Judy how?

868
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,395
Judy found out the Mars Project
was just a, a publicity stunt.

869
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:30,816
She told me. We started working together
to find proof to bring it to the press,

870
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:35,195
but she was just too emotionally invested
with the project and with Brody, and...

871
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,991
You know, I warned her.
I warned her not to confront him, but...

872
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,286
[sighs] she got impatient, and...

873
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:43,704
now she's dead.

874
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,122
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

875
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:46,498
Do you know Anders Brody?

876
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:49,477
His reputation means everything to him.
I thought he'd come after me next.

877
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:51,211
It's a clever ruse, but it won't work.

878
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,255
All the evidence points to you.

879
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,132
What evidence? What are you talking about?

880
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,652
[Chloe] You're the only person with access
to Mission Control,

881
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:58,761
video surveillance.

882
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:01,513
You owned a space suit
for the Red 1 Mars Project.

883
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:04,224
The cameras captured
a reflection of your suit

884
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:07,603
heading towards the dome just seconds
before the cameras were wiped.

885
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:11,523
And if I hazard a guess,
this tacky rug is sheepskin

886
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:14,151
and matches a hair
found at the crime scene.

887
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:18,155
Oh, no. No, no, no.

888
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:21,075
You're right, I'll go with you.

889
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:23,160
Sam's lying.

890
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:24,452
He didn't do it.

891
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:26,955
I killed Judy.

892
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,740
[Chloe] Drop the knife, Mandy.

893
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,877
No, I don't want to hurt anyone else,
it's just...

894
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,046
I brought it as proof
it's the murder weapon.

895
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,799
Oh, it looks like Brody and Judy
weren't the only ones

896
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:39,259
breaking the "No fraternizing
at work" rule.

897
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:40,552
[Sam] I don't understand.

898
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,930
You took my suit and you killed Judy?

899
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,474
- Why?
- I thought you were in love with her.

900
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,477
I mean, you were sneaking around,
and, and...

901
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,812
[sighs] hiding things.

902
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:52,272
and then I caught you
on the phone with her, whispering.

903
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,036
No, I was working with her
to expose Brody.

904
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,567
The whole Mars Project is fake.

905
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,027
What?

906
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,907
Why didn't you say anything?

907
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,076
'Cause I was trying to keep you safe.

908
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:09,632
You know, when you went away
on that first project, I waited for you.

909
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,667
You were gone for so long.

910
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,669
And when you came back,
you were so different.

911
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:15,379
I thought you didn't love me anymore.

912
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:19,591
It doesn't matter where I am.
Here, the moon, Mars...

913
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,760
It does not matter. There is nothing...

914
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,888
that will change the way
that I feel about you.

915
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,473
Even if I'm in prison?

916
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,557
Nothing.

917
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,771
[sobs]

918
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,566
[handcuffs rattling]

919
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:45,743
[elevator dings]

920
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:50,164
Detective!

921
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,207
No. It's just me.

922
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,878
I know what you're about to do
and I won't let you.

923
00:45:57,045 --> 00:46:00,382
I have my... issues with Lucifer,

924
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,594
and yeah, I am kind of pissed at Chloe.

925
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:05,429
But this? No.

926
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,514
Kissing me was one thing.

927
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,893
Chloe is a good person.
She doesn't deserve this.

928
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:12,336
[in American accent] You're right.

929
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:14,897
You are right. Chloe is special.

930
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:18,192
Which is why I've changed my mind...

931
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:19,943
and... [chuckles]

932
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:22,696
...I'm pretty sure
Chloe has, too, actually.

933
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,157
It seems that, uh,

934
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:28,285
she likes this new Lucifer
even better than the old.

935
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:29,828
You told her who you really are?

936
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:30,912
No.

937
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,248
No, but I will, in time.

938
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,628
See, I've decided
I'm not going to break Lucifer's life.

939
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,295
[chuckles]

940
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,547
I'm gonna take it.

941
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:43,759
So, if you'll excuse me.

942
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,220
Yeah, that's not...

943
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,303
[choking]

944
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:49,890
[grunting]

945
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:57,481
I have a date to keep.

946
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:01,860
[grunts]

947
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:08,700
[elevator dings]

948
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,210
Lucifer?

949
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,923
I'll be there in a moment, Detective.

950
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,006
Okay.

951
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,557
[sighs]

952
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,231
Good evening.

953
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,026
Hi.

954
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,616
Do you remember the last time
we were here?

955
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:51,576
Of course.

956
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,788
We told each other how we felt.

957
00:47:57,249 --> 00:48:00,919
I just hope you know that
I meant every word I said.

958
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,128
I...

959
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,175
I love you, Lucifer.

960
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,636
And I still do.

961
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:11,930
And I meant it, too.

962
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:15,183
I love you, Chloe.

963
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:17,643
[sighs]

964
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,020
Oh...

965
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:21,773
I've waited such a long time for this.

966
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:22,857
Oh...

967
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:24,817
Me, too.

968
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,528
[both chuckling]

969
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,281
- [Michael] Oh!
- Hmm.

970
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,829
[Michael sighs deeply]

971
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,331
See?

972
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,417
Still have it on.

973
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,879
I can see that. [chuckles]

974
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,381
- You know...
- Mm?

975
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,427
- ...once we do this...
- Yeah.

976
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,681
...things are never going to be the same.

977
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:56,892
I believe you're right.

978
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,522
- [gun fires]
- [Michael screams]

979
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:03,982
[groans]

980
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:05,775
[panting]

981
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,487
Once I shot Lucifer
to prove he was the Devil,

982
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,864
and now I'm shooting you
to prove you're not.

983
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:18,914
That's what I thought.

984
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:23,043
[breaths heavily]

985
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:28,265
[in American accent]
How long have you known?

986
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:32,177
I knew something was off
the first time I kissed you.

987
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:37,224
But you always had such good explanations,
such good lies.

988
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,393
I wanted to believe you.

989
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:43,438
But then I saw you with Maze.

990
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,441
That's when I knew.

991
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,194
Lucifer would never...

992
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:51,028
do that to me.

993
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,490
So...

994
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,033
Who are you?

995
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,371
I'm Lucifer's brother.

996
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,163
Michael.

997
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:03,667
It's nice to meet...

998
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:04,584
Ow!

999
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,712
You know that won't kill me.

1000
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:10,132
- [grunts]
- Yeah, but it makes me feel better.

1001
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,175
Okay, okay, okay. I get it.

1002
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:13,719
[chuckles]

1003
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:16,096
[panting] I get it.

1004
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:18,597
So what?

1005
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:22,769
I guess this means you never
really liked the new Lucifer.

1006
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,646
You're not the only one who can lie,

1007
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,482
and you are no Lucifer.

1008
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:34,364
I don't know why you're here
and I don't care,

1009
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,533
but I do know that I am glad,

1010
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:38,827
because you made me realize

1011
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:42,164
that all my fears that Lucifer had changed
were just that.

1012
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:45,625
They were fears.

1013
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,670
What Lucifer and I have is special.

1014
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:52,174
It's real, and it doesn't matter
how many lies you tell me.

1015
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:54,760
I will never lose faith...

1016
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:56,845
in me and him.

1017
00:50:58,722 --> 00:50:59,722
Oh, really?

1018
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,767
No more lies, huh?

1019
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,271
Well, how about a truth, then?

1020
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:09,982
You...

1021
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:13,320
are a gift from God, Chloe Decker.

1022
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:18,575
What does that mean?

1023
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:22,245
It means that you were
never supposed to exist.

1024
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:26,291
Father made you for Lucifer.

1025
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:30,587
You were put here on Earth only for him,

1026
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,757
to be his little plaything.

1027
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,680
Now, isn't that special?

1028
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:43,725
[scoffs]

1029
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:45,852
I don't believe you.

1030
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,064
[chuckles]

1031
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:52,400
It's time for you to go.

1032
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,277
Get out!

1033
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,993
[gasping]

1034
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,169
[exhales deeply]

1035
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:25,684
You're up late...

1036
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:30,688
Michael.

1037
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:35,986
Congratulations, bro.

1038
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:39,322
Used to take you forever
to figure out I was playing you.

1039
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,908
You shouldn't have used fear
to get inside my head.

1040
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:44,035
You shouldn't have done that.

1041
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:46,580
It was way too obvious.

1042
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,626
Does Father know you're here?

1043
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,795
Oh, please. I do what I want.

1044
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,340
Go home, Michael.

1045
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:00,010
You don't belong here.

1046
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:02,304
Well, I could.

1047
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:06,183
And when I get there, I could also
tell Remy it's time to come back,

1048
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,143
'cause you know who else
doesn't belong here?

1049
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:12,314
That's right. Your son, Chucky.

1050
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:15,525
I'm not afraid of you, Michael.

1051
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:17,944
Now go home.

1052
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:24,075
Lucifer's life sucks anyway.

1053
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:26,620
The only thing worse is the traffic.

1054
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:31,082
Oh, I think thou doth protest too much.

1055
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:36,671
You see, you pride yourself
on exploiting everyone's fears,

1056
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:38,465
but we've always known yours.

1057
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:42,761
You're terrified that
Lucifer is better than you.

1058
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:45,597
That he'll always be

1059
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:47,140
better than you.

1060
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:51,019
Please.

1061
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:52,853

00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:54,522
The Devil?

1063
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,859
The, the, the guy that was cast
out of Heaven for all eternity?

1064
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,238
Exactly, Michael,
because despite even that, you know,

1065
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:02,655
deep down...

1066
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:05,951
he'll always end up winning.

1067
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:09,536
We'll see.
