1
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,116
Yo, boss! Johnny's gotta make water!

2
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,409
No chance, man. Shut up!

3
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,497
Oh, he's peeing!
Johnny's peeing all over the seat!

4
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,957
[prisoner] What are you
fucking around for, man?

5
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:24,751
[guard] Damn it, Johnny!

6
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,837
[prisoners chattering]

7
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,840
- [guard] Really? What's your problem, man?
- [grunting]

8
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,177
- [straining]
- [prisoner] Get him down!

9
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,388
[grunting]

10
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,807
[shouts]

11
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,143
- [gunshot]
- [grunts]

12
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,645
[engine revving]

13
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,396
[grunting]

14
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,111
[shouting]

15
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,570
[screaming]

16
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,329
[metal creaking]

17
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:21,766
- [chattering]
- [laughing]

18
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,954
[piano playing off-key]

19
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:52,505
[Michael] You know,
I always wondered why a piano.

20
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:56,342
You're supposed to be the edgy one.
Wouldn't a guitar be more, uh...

21
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,888
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Lucifer! Lucifer. Lucifer.

22
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,598
I am not here to fight.

23
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,600
Oh, well, I am most certainly am!

24
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,102
[panting] Well, then what would happen

25
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:10,690
to all theseÂ poor,
fragile humans, dear brother?

26
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,696
[gasps]

27
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,323
It's all right, everyone!

28
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:21,367
Just a little brotherly squabble.
[chuckles]

29
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,579
- It's fine. It's fine. Music up.
- [dance music playing]

30
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:28,625
[Michael] And besides,
I mean, really, what's the point?

31
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,043
I've already won.

32
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,420
I've assembled the Flaming Sword,

33
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:36,090
and thanks to it, and...
[chuckles]...my charms, of course,

34
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,593
I have got
the majority of angels on my side.

35
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:41,846
And yet, here you are. Why?

36
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,723
To avoid bloodshed, brother.

37
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,602
To keep our siblings safe. To make peace.

38
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,482
I am here with an offer.

39
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:56,110
[scoffs]
There is nothing that you could offer me.

40
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,571
Hmm. [chuckles]

41
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,615
What about a throne?

42
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,451
[laughs]

43
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,662
Are you offering me my old job?

44
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:11,084
I take Heaven. You take Hell.
It's kind of poetic if you think about it.

45
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:14,963
And, uh, I will let you rule down there
however you see fit.

46
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,966
Oh, gee, thanks, bro.

47
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,176
But been there, done that, tried the veal.

48
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,680
Ah-ah-ah!
But I haven't told you the best part.

49
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,766
Chloe will be down there with you.

50
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,103
I mean, talk about happily ever after.

51
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,897
What are you talking about?
That's impossible.

52
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:37,568
Even if you become God, you wouldn't have
the power to force her soul down there.

53
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,321
Only someone's guilt
can take them to Hell.

54
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,698
Exactly.

55
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,200
Think about it.

56
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:48,830
The father of her child is dead
because of a case he was working for her.

57
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,794
Did you do all of this?

58
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,171
Did you have them take Daniel?

59
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:01,175
No, no, no.
That part was just a very happy accident.

60
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,220
But when they
told me they had him... [laughs]

61
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,432
oh, brother,
I realized I had a golden opportunity.

62
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,183
So you...

63
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,562
you told <i>them</i> to kill Dan?

64
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,771
You're welcome.

65
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,024
- [Lucifer inhales]
- [grunts]

66
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,819
[chuckles] Easy with the temper, brother.

67
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,404
Dan is in Hell because of you!

68
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,990
Well, technically,
it's because of his own guilt,

69
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,992
which he really
should've gotten over by now.

70
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,660
[shouts]

71
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,912
Forget about the past, brother.

72
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,998
Focus on the future.

73
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,750
Your future.

74
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,752
With Chloe.

75
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,132
[chuckles]

76
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,097
[Michael] You need time
to think about it. I get it.

77
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:52,101
But just so you know,
the vote is tomorrow.

78
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,729
And I'm holding it here on Earth
so you can attend.

79
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:57,690
You know, because of the whole
"you're banished from Heaven

80
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,526
and would be instantly incinerated
if you returned" thing.

81
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,905
[chuckles] Though,
that would be fun to see.

82
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,823
Brother.

83
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,954
I am offering you
a chance at a happy ending.

84
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,333
I hope you take it.

85
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,362
Linda.

86
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,032
[chuckles]

87
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:51,993
See?

88
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,622
This is what caring about people gets you.

89
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:58,459
Sitting around like idiots,
getting all emotional over inanimate junk!

90
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:03,423
So can we please just stop with
the crybaby bullshit and get this done?

91
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:12,973
[gasps]

92
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,981
[shouts]

93
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,528
[Linda] Maze.

94
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,531
Maze, honey, it's gonna be okay.

95
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,741
What is that?

96
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,663
[sobbing] It's the T-shirt that Dan...

97
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:40,334
had to steal from Chloe
after I knocked him out

98
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,921
and dumped him naked at her house.

99
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,633
[sobbing] I still...

100
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:51,429
I still don't know
how he fit his stupid ass in this thing.

101
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,557
[chuckles, sobbing]

102
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,937
I miss him.

103
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,315
- [crying]
- [Linda] Maze.

104
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,108
[sighs] Okay.

105
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,194
[wailing]

106
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,612
Okay.

107
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:10,740
It's okay.

108
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,701
Okay.

109
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,703
It's true.

110
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:21,000
It's true,
sometimes when you care about people...

111
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,546
you have to go through pain and loss.

112
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,634
But that's the price of joy.

113
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,012
[Amenadiel] She's right, Mazikeen.

114
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:38,017
In order for none of us to be sad,
we would have had to have never met Dan.

115
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,729
You wouldn't want that. None of us would.

116
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,190
[sobbing] Mnh-mnh.

117
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,777
Like... like when...

118
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,447
when Dan and I

119
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,908
pul... pulverized that gang together.

120
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,995
It was beautiful.

121
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,250
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

122
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,125
Exactly.

123
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:07,296
And remembering, um...

124
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,384
sweet times like those...

125
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,429
are what helps heal the hurt.

126
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,185
[Linda] Because trust me...

127
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:28,359
never loving anyone
is far worse than loss.

128
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,288
[elevator bell dings]

129
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,794
[Lucifer] Thank you for coming, Detective.

130
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,463
- Yeah.
- Um, how's Trixie?

131
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:56,012
Uh, she's, you know,
she's with my mom and Dan's parents.

132
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,388
She's a strong little girl.

133
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,349
She's just having to be stronger
than she ever should right now.

134
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,770
Listen, I know
that you asked me to come here,

135
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:09,275
but I just wanna get
something off my chest first. Um...

136
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:13,321
You know the argument
the other night, it...

137
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:19,827
It just... we were both stressed,
and, um, it was emotional and...

138
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,204
There's no need, Detective.
You were right.

139
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:27,043
You were able to say
the thing I couldn't admit to myself.

140
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,879
I wanted to be God for the wrong reasons.

141
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,259
But now I know why I <i>need</i> to be God.

142
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,387
For Dan's sake.

143
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,305
What do you mean?

144
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,893
Uh, please. Sit down, please.

145
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,981
[clears throat]

146
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,401
[Chloe clears throat]

147
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,071
So, Dan's...

148
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,658
Dan's death... [exhales]

149
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,286
Everything that's happened
is all Michael's fault.

150
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,456
He's been assembling
the Flaming Sword to win the war.

151
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:09,460
So that's why they killed Dan,
to keep us from finding that out?

152
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,462
No.

153
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,714
No.

154
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,675
Michael killed Dan...

155
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,552
so that you would feel guilty.

156
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:23,307
So that when you die,
you'll go down to Hell.

157
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,852
A twisted bribe to get me
to go back like a good little Devil.

158
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,272
I don't even know...

159
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,192
I don't know what to do with that!

160
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,777
You must refuse to give in.

161
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,987
It's all a manipulation.

162
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,490
Detective, youÂ mustn't feel guilty.

163
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,120
Right. Yeah, okay. [sniffles]

164
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,497
I'll just snap my fingers
and not feel guilty.

165
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,457
- I'm serious, Detective.
- I'm serious too.

166
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,252
That is not how emotions work, Lucifer.

167
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,380
Prove me wrong. Go ahead!

168
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,006
Go on! Just...

169
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,884
[inhales]...feel worthy!

170
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,678
[gasping]

171
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,514
Or you know what?
No, this is better.Â This is better.

172
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,686
Make yourself vulnerable.

173
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,231
- [Lucifer sighs]
- [chuckles]

174
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,571
- It's easier said than done, isn't it?
- This isn't the same.

175
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,491
[inhales] We can't let Michael win,
and you can't end up like Dan.

176
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,870
What are you talking about,
end up like Dan? Dan's in Heaven.

00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,588
Lucif...

178
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,259
Where is Dan right now?

179
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:43,637
Where is he?

180
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,389
Don't make me say it, please.

181
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,394
- Where is he?
- [wings flap]

182
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,478
Who's there?

183
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,355
Michael?

184
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,149
Remiel.

185
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,860
- Lucifer.
- Remi!

186
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,905
[gasping]

187
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,373
She's dead.

188
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,709
Oh, my God.

189
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,590
Michael must have
found out she was our spy

190
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,509
and killed her with the Flaming Sword.

191
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,763
Wait, are there
actual flames on the sword?

192
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:29,809
Detective, this is hardly the time to
start questioning the rules of celestials,

193
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:33,562
but, yes, the sword has flames on it.
It makes sense. Don't overthink it.

194
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:37,191
No, I'm only asking because, look,
there's no burn marks around the wound,

195
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:40,361
so whatever Michael killed her with,
it couldn't have been flaming.

196
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:43,030
So he must have just used Azrael's blade.

197
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,867
But when I saw Michael,
he said he had the sword.

198
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:52,540
If he did, the little show-off would have
used it, which means he's bluffing.

199
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,250
He hasn't found the piece yet.

200
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,668
We don't know where it is.

201
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,128
Michael has an army of angels
to search for him.

202
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,339
Maybe Remiel found out
where the piece was.

203
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,508
You think she was coming to tell us that?

204
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,342
I don't know.

...this could be a clue.

208
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:17,064
Look, I know it's asking a lot,
but I need the detective one last time.

209
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:18,774
I need your help.

210
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,192
Of course.

211
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,739
Maybe I can't control my guilt,
but I sure as hell can channel my anger.

212
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,783
Let's take that bastard down.

Hey, big guy.

215
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,767
You took one of the good ones.

216
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,645
And I'm...

217
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:00,149
I'm glad he's
with you and everything, but...

218
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,444
I just miss him.

219
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,738
I miss him a lot.

220
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,959
And I know you got
a lot on your plate, and...

221
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,420
[sighs] I know. I know.

222
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:25,299
Darkness makes the light
shine brighter and everything, but...

223
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,011
it's extra dark right now...

224
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,140
and I'm having a really hard time seeing.

225
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,145
It almost feels like...

226
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,315
you're not even up there anymore.

227
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,153
But... [sighs]

228
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,823
I know
that's totally impossible. [sniffles]

229
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:51,699
So...

230
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,453
I would really appreciate it...

231
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,621
[inhales]

232
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,791

233
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,794
Or at least just... just, you know,

00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,838

235
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:05,923
Or just...

236
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,385
Okay, what I'm trying to say is just...

237
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,470
just give me some sort of sign,

238
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:15,641
just let me know that
I'm where I'm supposed to be,

239
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,977
where I need to be. [sniffles]

240
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,186

- Yeah.

241
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:22,690
[sighs] Thank God you're here.
We're gonna need your help.

242
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,525
- We'll be right back.
- Okay.

00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,193
- Okay?
- Okay.

244
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:30,738
Thanks.

245
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:38,372
Hmm. Maybe I should run
another sample through mass spec.

246
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:41,917
- [Chloe] Why?
- Because this doesn't make any sense.

247
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,794
The report says that it's yeast.

248
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,546
Well, Remiel did love a hot tub.

249
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,756
Yeast, that <i>is</i> weird.

You know what? Give me a second.

00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:52,720
Okay.

252
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:57,224
I know you said to just examine
what's <i>on</i> the feather, but...

253
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,729
I can't help but do the math and...

254
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,315
I think I know
what this is about, Lucifer.

255
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,693
You... you... you do?

256
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,402
Come on.

257
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,906
Ginormous mystery feather?

258

On the down-low investigation?

259
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,621
Lucifer, you have to know
that you can trust me by now.

260
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,791
So tell me the truth.

261
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,588
You hit an emu with your car, didn't you?

262
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,151
- [Chloe] I think I got it.
- I can't believe it.

Yes, thank you, Miss Lopez.

[Ella and Lucifer sigh]

267
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:47,191
Okay. Remember TJ Ross,
the fence who hadÂ Amenadiel's necklace?

268
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:50,394
The twerp who launched me across the room
like an Angry Bird? How can I forget?

269
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,112
When I was working
the dead med tech case,

270
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,198
I looked into
the locations he operated out of,

271
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,200
and one of them
was an abandoned beer factory.

272
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,659
A yeasty venue indeed.

273
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,287
What if Remiel was trying
to tell us before Michael got there?

274
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,622
And he got to her first?

275
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,625
Maybe we can stillÂ get
to TJ beforeÂ Michael does.

276
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,167
It's been hours.

We have to go see. We have to try.

Yeah.

might I trouble you for one last favor?

One hundred percent.

351
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,415
What about Remiel? What about our sister?

352
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,625
Does it matter to you
that Michael murdered her?

353
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,793
That can't be true.

354
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,422
Michael?

355
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,760
I did what I had to.

356
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,430
Sometimes sacrifices
have to be made for the greater good.

357
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,600
Heavy is the head
that wears the crown and all that.

00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,483
Well, hello, Chloe.

361
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:42,611
You do know bullets can't hurt me, right?

362
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,655
Wasn't supposed to hurt you.

363
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,407
[wings flap]

364
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,576
- It was supposed to distract you.

[exhales]

366
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,088
[Linda] Okay. All right. Watch this.

367
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:03,799
Ready?

368
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,426
Okay.

- [Linda] Did you see that?

- [Linda] Did you see that?

371
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,476
I mean...

372
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,270
He falls all the time,Â Amenadiel.

373
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:20,023
Twice as much as
the other kids in the baby group.

374
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,400
Okay. Okay, so,

375
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:25,737
this occupational therapist/mom/influencer
that I follow on Instagram

376
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,697
who sponsors a blog, says that we...

377
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,242
- Maybe what we should do, Linda,
- [gasps]

378
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:33,120
is just let Charlie
figure it out for himself. Yeah?

379
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:36,706
You mean,
we should just let him hurt himself?

380
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,292
I don't think I can do that.

381
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,294
How could... How could you do that?

382
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:44,464
[chuckles] We're not signing him up
for cage fighting, Linda.

383
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,926
Falling is how humans learn.
It's how I learned.

384
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,930
Look, I... I lost my wings, my powers.

385
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,599
I fell again and again.

386
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,768
You know?

387
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,061
And getting back up...

388
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,022
[sighs]

389
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:05,068
...well, that was the most
empowering experience of my life.

390
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,030
Yeah. I'll make a chart.

391
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:14,286
I'm gonna log every time you fall,
Charlie, and see if there's a pattern.

392
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:18,039
Then I can slide into the mom-fluencer's
DMs and see if she has any ideas.

393
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,501
- [cell phone vibrates]
- Yeah. [chuckles] Hello.

394
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:23,962
[chuckles]

395
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:29,926
What?

396
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,178
No.

397
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:33,846
[hesitates]

398
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,268
[Linda] Amenadiel, what happened?

399
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:41,937
[sighs]

00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,751
[Lucifer sighs]

401
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,128
I can't believe Remi is gone.

402
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,296
She...

403
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,718
She died like she would have wanted.
She died a warrior.

404
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,554
It doesn't matter how she died.
She's still dead!

405
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:17,098
Dad and his mysterious ways.

406
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,267
If he'd just chosen a successor,
we wouldn't be here.

407
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,853
Remiel would still be alive,
Dan wouldn't be in Hell.

408
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:26,358
Father didn't give us the answers, Lucy,
because he wanted us to find our own way.

409
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:29,069
- Oh, even if it means dying?
- Yes!

410
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:31,863
Yes, Lucy.

411
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,992
You have to risk falling if you wanna fly.

412
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,079
Dad had faith in us.

413
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:42,415
- That's why he gave us choice.
- [Lucifer] Well, he shouldn't have.

414
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:46,711
I had the choice to save everything
and everyone I care about, but I didn't.

415
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:47,963
I chose wrong.

416
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,923
Michael is going to be God

417
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:52,801
because I didn't have the balls
to kill a two-bit fence

418
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,554
who wound up dying anyway.

419
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:59,516
And now, who knows how many other people
are gonna die because of my...

420
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,102
cowardice?

421
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:05,188
It's not cowardly to save a life.

422
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:09,651
It's not cowardly
to fight for a single soul.

423
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,737
We owe it to Remiel. We owe it to Dan.

424
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,365
We are the ones still standing.

425
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,577
We are the ones that have to fight.

426
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,371
[scoffs] Metaphorically
for you, of course,

427
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:24,332
because our siblings are invulnerable.

428
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,419

- [Mazikeen] She won't be powerless.

429

430
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,090

Thank you, Maze. [sighs]

432

I'm just not sure I know how to use this.

433
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,476
It's okay. I figured a way around that.

434
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:45,812
You're not fighting!

435
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:49,149
Dan died because of me, Lucifer.

436
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,232
I am fighting.

437
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,735
You are not fight...

438
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:52,818
I am fighting!

439
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:58,741
Fine.

440
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,954
Fine. Well, even if we had
a dozen demon blades,

441
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,499
it's still the four of us
against a literal army of angels.

442
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,919
I think I might have an idea
how we can get our own army.

443
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,049
You don't mean...

444
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:17,469
They're the best chance we've got.
What do you think, Maze?

445
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,262
[Mazikeen] Hey, I'm all in.

446
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,222
Let's kill a bunch of angels.

447
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,766
[Amenadiel] No, Mazikeen!

448
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,394
Now, if we're gonna do this,
there will be no killing.

449
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:27,895
They're our family.

450
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,148
You wanna tie
another hand behind our backs?

451
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,317
Fight a war like a bunch of wussies?

452
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,235
It's not cowardly...

453
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,030
to save a single life.

At least we'll all die together.

I know what you all desire.

And I know it's notÂ me as God.

But I also know you don't want him either.

505
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:52,058
So you have a difficult decision to make.

506

Everyone knows
what Michael's all about. Fear.

507

He's using it now
by threatening you with the Flaming Sword.

But me...

509
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:05,446
I'm gonna try
and convince you with the truth.

I'm gonna tell you
the real reason I want to be God.

511

[Zadkiel] I know why
Lucifer wants the throne.

512
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:19,793
He told me.

00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:25,508
And it's for love,

524
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:36,079
Well, looks like we have the numbers.

525
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:39,707
Consider the vote complete and me...

526
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:45,505
God!

527
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,433
God!

528

[bird tweets]

529
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,229
Oh, come on!

530
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:06,609
I thought there'd be a little some-some,
a flash of lightning, maybe, unless...

531
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,029
I... I thought Dad said we were choosing.

532
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,867
Maybe it has to be unanimous.

533
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,079
Right. Right. [chuckles]

534
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:22,500
Well, if it has to be unanimous,
there's only one way to make that happen.

535
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:25,128
Get rid of all the opposing votes.

536
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,256
[Lucifer] Wait.

537
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,466
- Mom never liked you.
- Thank you.

538
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,260
[huffs] Where is Maze?

539
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,053
Any minute now, Lucy. I'm sure of it.

540
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,856
[Chloe] What are we gonna do?

541
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,067
Can you hear that?

542
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,696
[humming] Can't touch this.

543

That's gotta be Dad, right?

[Lucifer] Yeah, yeah, no, no, she's right!

558
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,730
God must be here making us sing!
Dad has returned!

00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,325
You're obviously just stalling.

564
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:41,495
Finally!

At my command, brothers and sisters!

566
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,510
[in English] That is so sexy.

567
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:56,594
Not now.

568
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:57,678
Right. Of course.

569
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,972

[Michael] Very cute. A little demon army.

573
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,069
But you still don't stand a chance.

574
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,914
[inhales] You might
wanna ask your girlfriend to leave,

575
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,249
or she's gonna get hurt.

576
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,459
I was just gonna say
the same thing to you.

577
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,796
[laughs] Chloe, how many times
do we have to go through this?

578
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,881
Your bullets can't hurt me.

- [grunting]

580
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:41,347
Turns out melting down one demon blade
makes a lot of bullets.

[kisses]

582
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,392
[Lucifer] So you see, dear brother,

583
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:47,270
we're more evenly matched
than you anticipated.

584
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:52,608
Now, I know you want to avoid bloodshed
amongst our siblings, as do I.

585
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:57,572
So... why don't we just, uh...

586
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,407
you know, shed each other's?

587
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,742
<i>Mano a mano?</i>

588
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:05,830
Or <i>ala a ala?</i>
Which means wing to wing in Latin...

589
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,540
Got it, yes, thank you.

590
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:08,958
And precisely.

591
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:11,377
I win, Godhood is mine.

592
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,839
You win, you have my full support,

593
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:18,426
and I'll crawl back to Hell
like a good little Devil.

594
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:23,723
<i>When</i> I win,
you won't be crawling anywhere.

595
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,851
This is to the death.

596
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,107
So be it.

597
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,696

That staff is
all that remains of the Tree of Life.

609
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:28,828
I know.

610
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,499
And I can't think of a better use for it.

611
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,292
Than for a lost cause?

612
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:36,170
No, we have Michael
right where we want him.

gonna take this sword from me, brother.

Okay, hold. The plan!

640

I told you she should leave.

And good news is sounds like
she made peace with her guilt.

660
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,017
I bet she made it to Heaven.

661
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,606
I guess that means
you'll never see her again.

662
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,693
I mean,
you really should have taken my offer.

Your banishment.
You'll die if you try to go to Heaven.

670

00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,880
That's impossible.

698
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:14,133
Says the dude
that just fell out of the sky.

699
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:15,216
[Lucifer gasps]

700
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:19,138
Why am I not burning to a crisp?

701
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,601
[exhales] I should be ashes by now.

702
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,523
I'll be damned. The ring.

703
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:33,485
Lilith's immortality has protected me.

704
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,279
[shudders]

705
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,240
Though not for long, it seems.

706
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:40,826
Okay, I don't know
what the fork any of that means,

707
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:43,203
but you look like you could use a hand.

708
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,831

[Lucifer coughs]

711
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:53,422
The last time I saw you,
you were... you were in Hell.

712
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:55,674
Did I fly in the wrong bloody direction?

713
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,384
Nope, you're in the right place.

714
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,721
This is Heaven.
Or at least,Â one of its many rooms.

715
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,973
I'm still trying to get
the lay of the land.

716
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,643
I hear they have a room
made entirely out of cotton candy.

717
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,311
No, no, no, that's impossible.

718
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:12,399
No soul has ever
made it up here from there.

719
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:16,570
I don't know about that,
but I know I took your advice.

720
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,490
I faced my family. My guilt.

721
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,910
You went through the door.

722
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,662
Yep, finally.

723
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,830
And boom, Heaven!

724
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:30,250
- [both laugh]
- Heaven.

725
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,503
[inhales] Heaven!

726
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:35,214
[exhales] The detective.

727
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:39,218
Hey, don't worry, she's here. Come on.

728
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:41,261
What... what are you doing?

729
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,889
- Hey, you helped me.
- [gulps]

730
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,015
Let me help you.

731
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:47,976
There we go.

732
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,522
- Wait, come on, Dad! Come on. Tell me!
- [laughing]

733
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:54,650
I'm serious.
Your mother's face was completely purple.

734
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:57,403
She forgot she had
the Althea makeup on.

735
00:44:57,486 --> 00:45:00,072
And no one in the PTA
was brave enough to tell her...

736
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:02,324
[Lucifer] Detective! Detective!

737
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,451
Thank you. Thank you.

738
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:06,953
Lucifer.

739
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:09,914
Lucifer!

740
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,250
What...

741
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:14,837
Lucifer.

742
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,297
What are you doing here?

743
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,383
[panting] I've come to get you.

744
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:22,886
It's not your time. You need to come back.

745
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:27,683
Oh, that's right. The...

746
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:31,895
- The... the war, and...
- Yes.

747
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,689
...and I left Trixie...

748
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,442
- and my friends and...
- Yeah.

749
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,277
...I left you.

750
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,778
- Yes.
- But... but...

751
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,825
my Dad's here,
and I can't... I can't lose him again.

752
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:48,871
It's okay. I'm not going anywhere.

753
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:53,375
But it sounds like some people
could useÂ your help, Detective Decker.

754
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:57,463
- Thanks, Dad.
- [breathing shakily]

755
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:01,717
- Okay. Wait! How do we get back?
- [gasps]

756
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,970
[Lucifer] I'm not sure <i>we </i>can.

757
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:08,766
I'm afraid there's
not enough power left for the both of us.

758
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,351
No, I'm not going without you.
What are you talking about?

759
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,644
[Lucifer] You have to.

760
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:15,939
You have to.

761
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,735
The world still needs you, Chloe Decker.

762
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:22,321
- No, you don't have to do that!
- [grunts, pants]

763
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:26,200
I know. I know I don't have to.

764
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:29,328
I choose to.

765
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:31,078
What?

766
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:35,959
I choose you, Chloe.

767
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,838

[Michael huffs] No way.

He did it.

790
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:07,009
He actually brought you back. [chuckles]

791
