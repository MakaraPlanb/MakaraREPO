He's the Devil,
and you've known about it all this time?

00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,417
I've never hidden my devil-ness
from anyone.

21
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,210
How'd you find out?

22
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,462
I saw him that night.

With Amenadiel and Charlie.

24
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:32,675
I came back and I saw his...
his freaking scary-ass red face.

25
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,178
Well, I'm not particularly fond
of your face either, Daniel,

26
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,971
but you don't see me trying to kill you.

27

How am I the bad guy here, huh?

28
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,433
I'm trying to save you, I'm trying...

29
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,957
I'm trying to save our daughter,
I'm trying to save the world!

30
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,897
Okay, Dan, I understand.

31
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,358
I get it, and when I first learned
about...

32
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,611
who he is,
I didn't handle it well, either,

33
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:54,374
but he's not what the world
makes him out to be. He's a good person.

- [splutters]
- He is.

35
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,244
And despite your differences,
I think you know that.

36
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,870
- You know him.

37
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,083

You're all crazy!

Where are you going?

00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,112
I'm not gonna shoot somebody else
if that's what you're worried about, okay?

43
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,929
I just need to get the hell away from him!

44
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,765
Shit. He's supposed to pick Trixie up
from the sitter.

45
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,853
I should get to her first and take her
to my mom's until he cools down.

46
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,296
Well, I wouldn't hold your breath.

47

I don't think "cool" is
in Dan's repertoire.

48

Are you sure you're okay?

49
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,739
I'm more than okay.

All of a sudden?

52
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,664
Why now?

53
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,666
Well, who cares?

54
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,877
Would you rather the bullet
have killed me?

55
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,962
No, of course not. I'm just trying to...

- Yeah, um...
- Thanks so much for having me over.

- Uh, wait, wait, wait.

- There's just one more...
- Oh. Yeah.

Pick a hand.

00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,852
[chuckles] Um...

72
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,103
This one.

73
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,187
Uh, try again.

- Hmm.
- Hmm.

75
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,817
Okay, so, that one.

76
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,109
Yes!

77
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,111
Phew! [chuckles]

78
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,614
What's that?

It's a key to my place.

That way you don't, you know, have
to wait outside for me next time.

Oh.

00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,042
Oh, shoot.

00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,460
I'm sorry.

- Is this too fast? I... I...
- No.

00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,298
Not at all.

86
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,801
It's totally too fast. Or am I crazy?

87
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,972
Um, well, I thought you said
things were going really, really well.

88
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:24,889
I did.

89
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,267
Is there such a thing as "too well"?

90
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,935
Okay.

91
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,186
Last night, right?

92
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,146

Pete takes my hand,
he stares into my eyes...

95
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,486
- Mm-hmm.
- ...and he says,

96
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,071
"I love...

97
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,075
meatloaf."

98
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,580
And I mean, sure, meatloaf,
absolutely delish, okay?

99
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,541
But I don't think
that's what he meant, Chloe.

100
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:55,503
I think <i>I</i> am the meatloaf. Me.

101
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,963
- Oh, wow.
- I know.

102
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,466
Swoon, right? But we, like, just met.

103
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,386
I mean, how long did it take Lucifer
to say "I love you"?

104
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,013
Uh...

105
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:08,766
Well, every relationship is different,
and, um...

106
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,979
You know, you probably you shouldn't
compare yourself to others, but, um...

107
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,401
Ella, this is a good thing.

108
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,571
Enjoy it. Embrace it.

109
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,448
- Okay?
- Embrace it.

110
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,241
- Yeah. Okay.
- All right.

111
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,828
[cackles]

112
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,582
- [snake hisses]
- Lucifer, what are you doing?

113
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,852
- Well, I can't just let Dan...
- [snake spits]

114
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,036
...get away with shooting me!

115
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,463
[laughs] An eye for an eye,
or in this case,

116
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,881
a snake for a bullet.

117
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,592
That is not a good idea.

118
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,469
No?

119
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,222
[sighs] No, no.

120
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,683
- You're right.
- [gasps]

121
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,435
I gotta think bigger.

122
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,312
I mean, it's not even poisonous.
[chuckles]

123
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,481
No, that's not what I mean.

124
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,024
Dan is fragile right now.

125
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,942
Please don't do something else
to set him off.

126
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,111
What's he gonna do,
bounce another bullet off me?

127
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,528
Ooh!

128
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,532
Speaking of, I've been thinking.

129
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,994
My newfound invulnerability around you
changes everything, especially on the job.

130
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,996
I mean, there may be no more mojo,

131
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,166
but there's also no more dodging gunfire.

132
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:16,709
In fact, from now on,

133
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,795
think of me as your human shield.

134
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,297
Or "Devil shield," rather.

135
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,632
Come on, let's practice.

136
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:23,549
Lucifer, no.

137
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,509
Listen.

138
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,095
I've been thinking
about the Whisper Killer case.

139
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,304
Something isn't adding up.

140
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:32,266
- But Klumpsky confessed to everything.
- Yes, but something is off.

141
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,977
Serial killers often go
for someone they know,

142
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,646
and then branch out to strangers.

143
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,024
Klumpsky had no connection to
the first three victims, only the fourth.

144
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,818
So it doesn't make sense.

145
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,322
Well, if only there was someone
we could talk to.

146
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,283
"The Whisper Killer"?

147
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:53,079
Lame. That doesn't even make sense.

148
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,832
I don't kill whispers.

149
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,543
I have a list of far superior names

150
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,545
I'd like you to submit
to the paper's editor.

151
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,464
For example, "The Silencer."

152
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,010
"The Husher."

153
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,304
No, no. Maybe... Maybe it should be...

154
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,388
[gasps]

155
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,561
"The Shusher."

156
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:22,775
I will deliver the names once you've
answered a few more questions.

157
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,735
Hmm.

158
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,954
[exhales] Deal.

159
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,956
Right. First question.

160
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,210
What's the worst thing you've ever done
to someone, without killing them?

161
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,380
I once ate someone's kidney
in front of them.

162
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,924
Ew. Well, that's a non-starter.

163
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,093
I refuse to put any part of Daniel
in my mouth.

164
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:54,182
How did you target Olivia Sacks
in San Antonio?

165
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,265
Ha.

166
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Olivia.

167
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,937
Well, I followed her home one night.

168
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:04,150
San Antonio is a nice town for stalking.

169
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,651
Uh, you know, I'm...

170
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,320
I'm sorry, it was Phoenix.

171
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:10,072
Um, Olivia was in Phoenix, right?

172
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,200
Right, yes.

173
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:16,412
Sorry, my victims kind of blend together
after a while.

174
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,371
Blending, yes.

175
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,707
Speaking of,
do you know how many laxatives

176
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,586
you can slip a man-child without,
you know, causing permanent damage?

177
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,880
Uh, please ignore my partner,
and back to Olivia.

178
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,507
Why did you move her body?

179
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,511
I like to switch things up,
keep you guys guessing.

180
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,428
[Chloe] Right.

181
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,679
Yes, clever.

182
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,430
And I see a...

183
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,300
Oh! You know what, I'm sorry.

184
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,726
I messed up again.

185
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,437
It was Joy Goodman's body that you moved,
not Olivia.

186
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,815
But you would know that, right?

187
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,609
What is this?

188
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,320
You trying to trip me up?

189
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,660
I think it's time for my lawyer.

190
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,705
[Lucifer sighs]

191
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,716
Klumpsky doesn't know
what he's talking about.

192
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,504
Agreed. He was completely useless
in my brainstorming session.

193
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:09,307
Well, what I mean is I don't think
he killed the first three victims.

194
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,174
So?

195
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,219
He clearly killed that schoolteacher
Madison, and he took a swing at you.

196
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:16,055
He belongs in prison, then Hell.
Who cares about the details?

197
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,391
[quivering exhale]

198
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,102
<i>I</i> care about the details, Lucifer.

199
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,605
But since you seem more concerned
with getting the perfect revenge on Dan,

200
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,607
why don't you just go do that?

201
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,484
I'll get to the bottom of this on my own.

202
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,861
Fantastic idea, Detective.

203
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,905
Divide and conquer. Yeah.

204
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,995
[industrial music playing]

205
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,284
Lucifer, I was right.

206
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,703
Klumpsky didn't kill the first three.

207
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,998
There's another serial killer,
and he's still out there.

208
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:27,585
Listen, I got a lead, tomorrow,
in the Arts District, so...

209
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,086
[screams]

210
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,299
[dramatic opera music playing loudly]

211
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,392
Yes.

212
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,981
Oh, that is it! [cackles]

213
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:53,444
That is how I get back at you, Daniel!

214
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,279
Oh!

215
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,323
[exhales] This calls for a drink!

216
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,452
[music ends]

217
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:02,995
Voicemail? [chuckles]

218
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,164
Didn't even hear it ring.

219
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,625
[sighs] Yes.

220
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,002
[Chloe] <i>Lucifer, I was right.</i>

221
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,296
<i>Klumpsky didn't kill the first three.</i>

222
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,841
<i>There's another serial killer,
and he's still out there.</i>

223
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:20,513
<i>Listen, I got a lead, tomorrow,
in the Arts District, so...</i> [screams]

224
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,266
[struggling sounds on phone]

00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,019
[Chloe yelping on phone]

[crashing sounds on phone]

[static on phone]

228
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:36,821
Detective!

229
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,155
[panting rapidly]

230
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,706
[gasps]

231
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,128
[breathes nervously]

232
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,920
Detective.

233
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,477
[police chatter on radio]

234
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,189
Signs of forced entry,

235
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,400
obvious evidence of a struggle,

236
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,235
valuables left behind.

237
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,028
This doesn't look like a robbery.

238
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,406
Go ahead, Miss Lopez. You can say it.

239
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,575
The detective's been kidnapped.

240
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,494
I-I-I still haven't been able
to get a hold of Dan.

241
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,997
Trust me,
he'll be of no use to us right now.

242
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,958
- Trixie. Is Trixie okay?
- Yes, she's safe, at her grandmother's.

243
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:35,296
The detective was re-examining
the Whisper Killer case.

244
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:39,633
In her voicemail, she mentioned finding
proof of another serial killer out there.

245
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:43,304
Wait, do you think that this other killer
found out that Chloe was onto him,

246
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,389
- and this is him covering up his tracks?
- I do.

247
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,184
I just wish we knew
what she'd figured out.

248
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:52,146
[sighs] Well, her phone and her laptop
were smashed.

249
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:55,024
Uh, tech team is trying to recover
what they can, but no guarantees.

250
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,903
None of this would have happened
if I hadn't been distracting myself.

251
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,780
I should have listened to the detective.

252
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,533
Yeah, you should have.

253
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,254
You should have!
You should have been there!

254
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,766
- Miss Lopez.
- Why weren't you there?

255
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,539
- Miss Lopez!
- You should have been there!

256
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,083
We can't lose our heads right now.

257
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,668
The detective needs us.

258
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:20,965
You're right.

259
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,759
She needs us.

260
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,804
Okay, we'll keep looking.

261
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,889
We'll keep looking.

262
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,524
Hey, what about this? I mean,

263
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,109
does this mean anything to you,
the name "Scotty Thomas"?

264
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,367
No, but that address is downtown.

265
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,870
In her message the detective mentioned
following a lead at the Arts District.

266
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,496
Then that has to be it.

267
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,123
Let's go.

268
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,545
[metal grate squeaking]

269
00:13:58,879 --> 00:13:59,880
Lucifer,

270
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:03,259
I-I-I'm a little out of my depth here.
I mean, I'm just a forensic scientist.

271
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,010
Relax, Miss Lopez.

272
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,763
We're just following a lead,
not walking into a killer's lair.

273
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,141
Yeah, but still, I mean, don't you think
we should loop in an actual detective?

274
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:14,144
We don't have time to brief someone new.
Here it is.

275
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,481
- [grunts] Crap, it's locked.
- Is it?

276
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:19,732
[snapping sound]

277
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,028
- Weird. Guess not.
- Mm.

278
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,331
What was that about
not walking into a killer's lair?

279
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,415
[Lucifer] Shh!

280
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,210
Do you think Chloe's here?

281
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,670
Should we call for backup?

282
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,380
I'm all the backup we need.

283
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,048
You're just an actor!

284
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,133
[toilet flushes]

285
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,389
[man humming]

286
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,099
What are you... Oh!

287
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,475
Whoa! Whoa!

288
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,810
- Where is she?
- [man whimpers]

289
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,520
If you killed her,
I swear to Dad, I...

290
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,231
Killed... Who are you?
Why would you think I would kill anyone?

291
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,318
Oh, really? I wonder!

292
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,529
[yelps] The knife? The lobby? No, no, no!

293
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,282
This is just for inspiration, I swear.

294
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,948
No, we got it all from a Hollywood
prop house that was going out of business.

295
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,371
I use it to get my team
in the right headspace.

296
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,709
What team? What headspace?

297
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:19,792
My nerd squad.

298
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:24,256
We're developing a virtual reality game
where the user gets to be a serial killer.

299
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,676
[chuckles ironically] Humans. Honestly.

300
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,387
Yeah, they're all blunts. Clearly props.

301
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:32,805
Well, then...

302
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,185
why did the detective
think this place was a lead?

303
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,437
D... Detective?

304
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,022
Wait.

305
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,190
Detective Decker?

306
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,191
You two work with her?

307
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,734
Are you Scotty Thomas?

308
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:44,817
Yeah.

309
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,714
The detective was supposed to meet me here
but she never showed.

310
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,491
I even printed the transcripts
she asked for.

311
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,120
Where are these transcripts?

312
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,833
Show me.

313
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,972
Sweet.

314
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,477
Detective Decker reached out to me
on KillShare.

315
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,559
And KillShare is...

316
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,313
It's a dark web chat site
for those interested in, well, killing.

317
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,774
Jeez, there's a site for everything.

318
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,150
We use it as research.

319
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,361
The posts are anonymous
and unmoderated.

320
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:30,030
Anyone can post anything,
and I mean <i>anything.</i>

321
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,157
People have some
pretty disturbing appetites.

322
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,244
Appetites you'll be encouraging
with your serial killer game.

323
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,203
Whoa, hey, man.

324
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,122
As long as they're scratching
that itch in VR,

325
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,565
they're not doing it in real life.

326
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,542
Okay? I'm one of the good guys.

327
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,465
And the KillShare crowd isn't exactly
into working with law enforcement,

328
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,754
but I offered to help.

329
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,381
Well, how, exactly?

330
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,633
Okay, well,
Detective Decker was on KillShare

331
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,302
tracking a user that
you guys apparently caught.

332
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,430
Les Klumpsky, a.k.a. the Whisper Killer?

333
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,099
I was one of the few
that he was direct messaging.

334
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,476
And Chloe wanted to read your convos?

335
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,688
Exactly. Now, the KillShare DM's,
they self-destruct,

336
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,732
but I screencap everything.

337
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,861
It's going to take forever
to go through all this.

338
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,404
Wait, hold on.

339
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,949
Klumpsky keeps referring to a "LilyMan85."

340
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,535
LilyMan? Worst superhero name ever.

341
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,371
[mumbles]

342
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:21,914
Found it.

343
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,793
Holy...

344
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,757
All of LilyMan's posts are
first-hand accounts of murders

345
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,300
that match the Whisperer Killer's,

346
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,969
with deets that haven't even
gone public yet.

347
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,097
Wait, Chloe said that our guy Klumpsky

348
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,576
didn't do the first three murders
that he admitted to, right?

349
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,226
Yes, that's what her message said.

350
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,270
I know what she figured out.

351
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,314
Klumpsky is a copycat.

352
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,984
This LilyMan is the original killer,
the one that she said was still out there.

353
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,861
Well, how do we find this LilyMan?

354
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:55,115
Uh, well, I mean, I can get Cyber to track
the different IP addresses of his posts,

355
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,909
but it's going to take some time.

356
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,702
We don't have time!

357
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,998
Well, m-maybe you can use the nerd squad.
Some of the best around. [chuckles]

358
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,833
Oh, my gosh, thank you!

359
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,504
Right. Well, while you do that...

360
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,256
- I need to make a call.
- Okay.

361
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,885
[Charlie crying]

362
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,308
[Maze growls]

363
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,227
Too many words.

364
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,895
Don't you have any books with pictures?

365
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,538
I thought you were supposed to help me.

366
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,774
Sorry, Maze,
I have to get Charlie to the hospital.

367
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,819
Linda's leaving her conference early,
so she's gonna meet us there.

368
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,153
Aren't you overreacting?

369
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,907
I mean, a fever of 101
doesn't sound like a big deal to me.

370
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,451
In Hell, we kept it at a brisk 120.

371
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,538
Right. Well, while 101 might not
be the end of the world for a normal baby,

372
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,707
Charlie's part angel, so,
for him to be running a fever like this

373
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,668
must mean there's
something wrong with him.

374
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,877
[phone rings]

375
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,547
[phone ringing continues]

376
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,073
You're supposed to pick that up
when it makes that noise, right?

377
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,476
I'm not talking to Lucifer.

378
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:05,978
Maze...

379
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,521
He kept my mother from me.

380
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,898
Does Lucifer even know
why you're mad at him?

381
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,108
No.

382
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,778
Well, maybe you might want to tell him.

383
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,322
[phone ringing continues]

384
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:29,710
What part of me not picking up
are you not picking up on?

385
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,213
Chloe's what?

386
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,217
Tell me what you need me to do.

387
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:40,137
- [brakes squeal]
- [Ella] Yes, that's correct.

388
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,848
Uh-huh. That's right.

389
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,935
Yes, yes, we traced LilyMan's IPs
to different addresses.

390
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,105
Only one was from a private residence,
probably the killer's.

391
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,107
We're already here. Send for backup.

392
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,194
Uh... Gotta go.

393
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,612
[flies buzzing]

394
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:57,737
[Lucifer] Ugh!

395
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,781
Oh! [Ella gasps]

396
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,160
Lucifer.

397
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,834
[Lucifer breathes nervously]

398
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,800
[both gagging]

399
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,346
[flies buzzing]

400
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,437
[Lucifer exhales]

401
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:36,318
[both breathing nervously]

402
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:39,988
[Lucifer gasps]

403
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,489
Detective?

404
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,681
[Ella sighs]

405
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,394
It's not Chloe.

406
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:11,937
Thank God.

407
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,439
Which means she's still out there...

408
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,484
in the hands of that bastard.

409
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,328
"For the numerous reasons above,

410
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:34,710
I demand your publication use
my preferred serial killer name.

411
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,586
Sincerely...

412
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:42,175
the Voice Box Killer."

413
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,430
[Maze] Can you really call yourself
a serial killer?

414
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,597
[gasps]

415
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,934
I heard you only did the one.

416
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,396
How did... How did you get in here?

417
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,189
I met a lot of your heroes.

418
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,775
Gacy, Dahmer, Stinky Ted.

419
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,404
You all have something in common.

420
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:05,991
You're a coward...

421
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,243
just like them.

422
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,872
But at least they came up
with their own shtick.

423
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,125
Who are you?

424
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,716
We're gonna get to know each other
real well.

425
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:28,638
Thanks, man.

426
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,682
[Pete] Hey.

427
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:32,808
Hey.

428
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,101
What are you doing here?

429
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:37,522
Guess my editor really liked
my Whisper Killer coverage,

430
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,983
'cause apparently
I'm her crime beat guy now.

431
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,443
Oh, well, that seems great.

432
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,320
I mean, why do you seem
so down about it?

433
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:47,991
I don't want you to think that I'm using
our relationship for personal gain.

434
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,951
Just say the word, and I'll leave.

435
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,120
Uh, no, I would never think that. No.

436
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,414
Look, I gotta do my job,
and you gotta do yours.

437
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:59,961
Are you sure? Because I know
we've been moving a little fast.

438
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,382
Who am I kidding?
We've been moving a lot fast, and...

439
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:08,637
I don't want to do anything
that would scare you away.

440
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:13,850
Honestly, Pete, you have been
nothing but absolutely amazing.

441
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:17,396
I don't even know why I've been worried
about moving too fast.

442
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:21,108
See? No, but I could tell.
I could tell you were concerned.

443
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,859
Yeah, kind of, but...

444
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,028
You know what?

445
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,989
For once, I know a good thing
when I see it, and...

446
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,450
[sighs, kisses]

447
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,494
I have got to rush back to the precinct,

448
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,745
but you do your thing.

449
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:34,996
This is perfect for you.

450
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,760
It's connected to the Whisper Killer case.

451
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,959
- Yeah, no, you got your hands full.
- Okay, yeah.

452
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,460
- Hey.
- Yeah?

453
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:46,091
This is probably dumb, but I did
a ton of research on the Whisper Killer.

454
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:49,302
It's all in a box at my place,
if you would ever want it.

455
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,139
Are you trying to make me like you
even more?

456
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,974
Mm... Maybe.

457
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,351
[sighs] You're just...

458
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,395
Look, I-I-I'll call you later.

459
00:23:58,478 --> 00:23:59,479
- Bye.
- Bye.

460
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,574
[grunts forcefully]

461
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:13,743
I can't. I'm sorry.

462
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:14,995
Try again, brother.

463
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:17,247
I tried five times already, Lucy.

464
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,542
I'm telling you,
I cannot slow down time anymore.

465
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:23,503
I haven't been able to
since that time I saved Linda.

466
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,173
Speaking of which,
I should probably go find her.

467
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,757
Charlie's test results should be in.

468
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,092
Oh, well, thanks for nothing.

469
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:30,552
[sighs]

470
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,264
Listen, I really wish
I could help you find Chloe,

471
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,892
- but I have faith in you, brother.
- Well, you shouldn't.

472
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,977
I'm useless without her!

473
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:42,355
How am I going to find the detective
without the detective?

474
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:45,400
Maybe stop wasting time
trying to get me to slow it and just,

475
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:49,404
you know, do some good old-fashioned
detective work.

476
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:50,906
Detective work?

477
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,282
[laughing] Me?

478
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:57,287
Are you trying to tell me that after
all these years of working with Chloe...

479
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,998
that you haven't learned anything?

480
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:02,708
[grunts]

481
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,837
Amenadiel. Dr. Subia wants to see us.

482
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,171
Okay.

483
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,592
You can find her, Detective Morningstar.

484
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,568
[Ella] Whoa!

485
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,362
Who did this for you?

486
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,405
No one. I did this myself.

487
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,325
I figured we needed to find similarities
between our victims

488
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,202
in order to build our killer's profile.

489
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,080
Be still my heart. Okay, what do we got?

490
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:43,750
Well, uh, the victim we found this morning
is Phyllis Cameron,

491
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:47,128
A-list movie director,
but based on the ME's report,

492
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,755
she died a week ago, which means that

493
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:52,968
LilyMan85 got to her before he killed
Diane Luna, the opera singer.

494
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,470
Okay, so our guy clearly has a type:
powerful women.

495
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,097
- Mm-hmm.
- And Madison,

496
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,058
our elementary school teacher,
is off-pattern because of...

497
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,143
Because she was killed by
copycat Klumpsky.

498
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,580
I mean, his sloppy trail of evidence
allowed us to catch him

499
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,189
before he could strike again,

500
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,817
but the original Whisper Killer, he's...

501
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,320
He's cleverer, he's cleaner.

502
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,031
Lucifer, I have got to say,

503
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,492
very impressive with the detective work.

504
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:18,952
Thank you.

505
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,580
If only it were enough to find him, to...

506
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,623
find her.

507
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,375
And we need more than this!

508
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,502
I talked to the copycat.

509
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,714
Well, "talk" isn't exactly the right word.

510
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,382
Well, did he scream anything of value?

511
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:35,218
Maybe. He said that he was messaging
with the original killer,

512
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,972
and found out that this LilyMan likes
to hunt his victims in restaurants.

513
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:43,393
Copycat said, and I quote,
"LilyMan looks for windbags."

514
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,771
So he targets women who talk a lot?

515
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:48,523
- Gulp.
- Hold on.

516
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,901
I think I remember seeing the last charges
three of the four victims made

517
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:52,986
were at a restaurant.

518
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,780
Wait, you went through
credit card statements

519
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,490
- and cross-referenced them?
- Yes.

520
00:26:57,574 --> 00:27:00,414
Call the restaurants, find out
if any of them have surveillance cameras.

521
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:01,620
I'm so on it.

522
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:02,704
Uh, right.

523
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:09,336
Did Klumpsky ever meet his inspiration?

524
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,379
- Did he ever get a good look at him?
- No.

525
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,463
Are you sure?

526
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,594
Five broken ribs, a torn rotator cuff,
and "It's a Small World" on repeat?

527
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,137
Yeah, I'm sure.

528
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,305
[sighs]

529
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:31,816
Okay, so only one of the places has CCTV.

530
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,403
All right. Maze and I will check it out.

531
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,406
And I don't know if this is helpful,
but...

532
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,218
Pete has some pretty extensive research
on the Whisper Killer murders.

533
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:43,203
I can see if he's got anything useful.

534
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,913
Yes, thank you, Miss Lopez.

535
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,208
Sorry, I can't show you the tapes.

536
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,252
[sighs] We don't have time for torture.

537
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,380
- Whoa! Torture?
- Do you have a better idea?

538
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:57,384
Well, if I still had my mojo,
I'd just ask, "What is it you desire?"

539
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:59,928
I want to be a dancer.

540
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,765
Wait, did my mojo just work?

541
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,269
I... I've never told anyone that before.

542
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:11,106
[chuckles] I'm back.

543
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:12,857
Maze, I'm back!

544
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,945
Right. Right, well, you're in luck,
Baryshnikov,

545
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,863
because I happen to own a nightclub.

546
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,281
So, you help us,

547
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,617
I'll hire you and make your <i>Footloose</i>
dreams come true.

548
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,536
- What do you say? Deal?
- Deal.

549
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:25,995
[laughing] All right.

550
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,082
Okay, boss. What are we looking for?

551
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,709
We are looking for...

552
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,252
her.

553
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:34,337
- She was here Thursday evening.
- Okay.

554
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,297
Good man.

555
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,549
[keyboard clacking]

556
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:44,514
So, have you ever heard of a demon getting
a soul?

557
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,392
[scoffs] Of course not. That's impossible.

558
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,688
Yeah, um... I've heard that all my life.

559
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:56,151
Then again, you did fall in love.

560
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,653
Amenadiel had a baby with a human.

561
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,323
There's a first for everything, right?

562
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:06,119
Well, that's different. We're angels.
You're just a demon.

563
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:09,497
[computer bleeps]

564
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,790
Oh! Ha!

565
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,084
There she is!
Yes, that's definitely her.

566
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,879
Right, we just need to wait
for the creepy guy stalking her.

567
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,339
How do we even know who we're looking for?

568
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,423
[groaning sigh]

569
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:21,633
Okay.

570
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,595
Never mind.

571
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,601
Oh, my Dad.

572
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,395
Pete?

573
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,232
I haven't been able to get a hold of you.
Are you here?

574
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,278
Pete?

575
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,739
Pete?

576
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,242
Guess not.

577
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,079
Okay, here I go.

578
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:53,500
Your not-at-all-creepy girlfriend,

579
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:56,461
coming in to borrow your files.

580
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,464
Nice.

581
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,870
[electric humming]

582
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,384
[electric humming intensifies]

583
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,435
[industrial music playing]

584
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,175
Oh, God.

585
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,352
El.

586
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,021
Hey.

587
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,317
Hey. Yeah, I...

588
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:47,447
I called you but you didn't answer,
so I just...

589
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:53,494
Anyway, I just came to grab
that research you offered.

590
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,414
Sorry, sorry... Sorry, if I just...

591
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:57,497
Sorry?

592
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,630
That's the reason
I gave you the key, silly.

593
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,466
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

594
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,468
- [kisses]
- [keys drop]

595
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,489
[seething exhale]

596
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,743
Did you unscrew that?

597
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:35,827
What?

598
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,331
No.

599
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,584
No, w-what screw?

600
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,257
Ella, I really wish
you hadn't gone in there.

601
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,593
No! No, don't! Ow!

602
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,682
- This is such a bummer.
- No... No...

603
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,309
- I was really hoping...
- No! No!

604
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,228
- ...that you'd be different.
- No! No! No!

605
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,312
Stop...

606
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:02,939
Open your eyes!

607
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,399
No! [Ella choking]

608
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,567
- [Pete straining]
- No! No!

609
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,445
- [panting]
- Oh, no! [choking]

610
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,322
Stop it... [grunts]

611
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,574
[Pete gasps, panting]

612
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:14,993
[Ella groans]

613
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,871
- [Pete grunts]
- [Ella panting]

614
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,790
[strains]

615
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,417
[breathes heavily]

616
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:33,219
[Lucifer] He hasn't said a word
since his arrest.

617
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,138
I'll get him talking.

618
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:38,057
No. We've only got one shot at this.

619
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:41,436
We can't risk him lawyering up or dying.

620
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,814
We have to approach this cautiously.

621
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,649
[door closes] Where is she, Pete?

622
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,443
- Where's Chloe?
- [Maze] No.

623
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,112
Lucifer, she is in no shape to face him.

624
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,322
Miss Lopez is stronger than you think.

625
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,825
Stronger than she thinks.

626
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:58,953
Where is Chloe?

627
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:06,044
We know you're LilyMan85, Pete.
The original Whisper Killer.

628
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:09,714
We have all the evidence we need
from your creepy little plant room.

629
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,801
God, just when I thought
I'd found a good guy.

630
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,218
I am a good guy.

631
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,388
Yeah, except for the whole, you know,

632
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,681
killing people part.

633
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,975
Exactly. Everyone has flaws.

634
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,519
"Everyone has flaws"?

635
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,731
Pete, it's not like
you left the toilet seat up.

636
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,483
You kill people.

637
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,276
Innocent women.

638
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,695
Because why?

639
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,199
What, were you abused as a child?

640
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:39,577
Did... Did... Did your dad hit you
one too many times? What?

641
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,162
No.

642
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:44,957
It was my mother,

643
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,626
and she didn't hit me,

644
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:50,004
she screamed at me all day, every day.

645
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,050
Is that why you cut
all those women's vocal cords?

646
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:57,261
Was that too obvious? Should I have
cut their hearts out instead?

647
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:01,766
All of this because
your mommy was mean to you?

648
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,851
No, she wasn't just mean to me.

649
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,061
She didn't love me.

650
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,106
All she loved was her stupid lily garden.

651
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,441
A lot of people have
crappy childhoods, Pete.

652
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,568
We don't become serial killers.

653
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,195
Mm...

654
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:21,786
So what, that...
That whole time you were just using me

655
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,371
to stay ahead of the investigation?

656
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,206
Yeah, it started that way,
and then it...

657
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:26,958
evolved.

658
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,545
Oh, my God.

659
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,048
You were going to kill me, weren't you?

660
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,134
I mean, I...

661
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,469
I fit your profile, I'm...

662
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,179
I'm definitely a talker.

663
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:43,099
Yeah, but everything you say is so nice.

664
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:48,729
I thought with you I was finally
going to feel something, anything, but...

665
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,731
Mm, nope.

666
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:58,531
And I did everything right,
everything that you're supposed to do.

667
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:00,658
Candlelit dinners,
I took you to that convention,

668
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,326
I gave you a key to my apartment.

669
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,370
Yeah.

670
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,916
You fooled me. Congrats.

671
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,711
Thank you, but it didn't work.

672
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,258
The only time I ever feel anything

673
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,927
is when I'm hearing them
choke on their own blood...

674
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:24,015
[exhales] unable to talk.

675
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,228
Hmm.

676
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:31,938
I don't know.

677
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:33,649
Maybe... [sighs]

678
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,990
Maybe if we got more time together.

679
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:42,741
Time?

680
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:43,868
Mm-hmm.

681
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:47,705
Time wouldn't change the fact that
you are a cold-blooded murderer.

682
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:50,791
Good point, but you gotta admit,
we have a lot in common.

683
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,126
We're nothing alike.

684
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,587
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure.

685
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:01,844
There is darkness in you, Ella.

686
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:05,389
I recognized it the very first moment
that we met.

687
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,729
Damn it, Pete! Just, where is Chloe?

688
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:15,024
I don't know, okay?
I didn't do anything to her. I swear.

689
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,029
You really have no idea where she is,
do you?

690
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:21,738
Nope.

691
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,994
Uh, Ells, just to be clear...

692
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,956
This is you breaking up with me, right?

693
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:31,998
Pete...

694
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,168
you're going to burn in Hell.

695
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,220
[whimpers]

696
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:47,640
Damn it.

697
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,476
This human stain is telling the truth.

698
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:53,896
He has no idea where she is.

699
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:59,235
I've wasted all this time
looking for the wrong bloody person!

700
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,279
[growls, yells]

701
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,240
This is all my fault!

702
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,034
I don't understand.

703
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,495
Where is she?

704
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:13,124
Who else would want to hurt the detective?

705
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,544
What if this isn't about her?

706
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,548
Lucifer, what if it's about hurting you?

707
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:24,969
[Chloe grunting]

708
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,388
[coughing]

709
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,356
[grunts]

710
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,486
[footsteps approaching]

711
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,373
Hello, Detective.

712
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:15,019
One tall non-fat almond milk latte
with sugar-free caramel drizzle.

713
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:16,979
It's your favorite, come on.

714
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,148
Come on.

715
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:24,861
Hey!

716
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,782
That was, like, seven bucks.

717
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,617
- God.
- What am I doing here, Michael?

718
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,868
Don't worry.

719
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,495
This is just temporary.

720
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,705
It's all part of a bigger plan.

721
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:38,042
Plan? What, to make me
dislike you even more?

722
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,125
No.

723
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,420
But... spoiler alert!

724
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,047
It is gonna be epic.

725
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:44,757
Just you wait.

726
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,593
Till then, I, uh...

727
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,429
I figured we should catch up.

728
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,933
I mean, a lot has happened
since we saw each other last.

729
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,559
And why would I talk to you?

730
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,478
Because you want to know what they mean,

731
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:00,356
the changes that my brother's
been going through.

732
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,690
Although, deep down,

733
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,026
I think you probably already know,
don't you?

734
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,319
Oh, so it's this again?

735
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,072
Trying to make me afraid
about my relationship with Lucifer?

736
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,074
Now, you see, that's just it, Detective.

737
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:13,953
Just like Lucifer can't create desires,
I can't create fears.

738
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:15,036
I just...

739
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:17,373
expose what's already there,

740
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:21,252
and, girl, you reek of fear. [chuckles]

741
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,546
You don't know what you're talking about.

742
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:28,467
So, what, you're not afraid of what
his newfound invulnerability means?

743
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:32,388
'Cause you do know that we angels,
we self-actualize, right?

744
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:36,350
Which means him choosing to be vulnerable
around you actually meant something,

745
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,394
so I'm just, you know,
putting it out there,

746
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:42,106
but I wonder what this new development
could mean.

747
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,189
You're wrong.

748
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,651
Lucifer and I are closer than ever.

749
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:48,194
Huh.

750
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,613
Yeah, you're probably right.

751
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,116
I mean, we all know Lucifer doesn't lie.

752
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:56,912
So, when he tells you he loves you,
you know he really means it, right?

753
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,126
Unless...

754
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:05,171
Oh, no.

755
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:08,466
No, no. no. He hasn't said it yet, has he?

756
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,342
Even though you said it to him?

757
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,470
That is... [groans]

758
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:17,600
Looks like you'll maybe need some time
to yourself, so...

759
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:21,437
I have a quick errand to run,
but don't worry, Detective.

760
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,314
I will be back before you know it.

761
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,567
Enjoy the cave.

762
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,151
[giggles]

763
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,493
[roars]

764
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,795
Found him in a bar, wasted.

765
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,216
Daniel.

766
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,218
No! No, no, no!

767
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:53,385
Daniel! Daniel!

768
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:54,845
Relax! Relax!

769
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:58,098
Stay away from me, don't hurt me.

770
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,642
Oh! Says the man who shot me.

771
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,438
Listen, Daniel,
I know we've had our differences,

772
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,980
but right now, what's happening
is far more important than us.

773
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,439
Tell me...

774
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,776
the night that you saw my face,

775
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,736
why did you come back to the house?

776
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:11,820
Wha...?

777
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,739
Because you called me.

778
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,616
You asked me to.

779
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,700
[sighs]

780
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:21,247
I didn't make that call, Daniel,
but I think I know who did.

781
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,330
Who?

782
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,624
My twin.

783
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:24,707
Michael.

784
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:26,751
Oh.

785
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,880
[chuckles] Dreadful poker face.

786
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,007
He's the one who told you to shoot me,
isn't he?

787
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,261
Look, I hate to break it to you, Daniel,
but you have been played.

788
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,846
But Michael's an angel,

789
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:40,185
and you're the Devil,
you're the Prince of Lies.

790
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,475
Dan!

791
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,603
Chloe has been kidnapped by Michael.

792
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,230
We need to find her before he does

793
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,983
whatever angelic things
he's planning on doing!

794
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,651
Wait, what do you mean, kidnapped?

795
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,534
- Yes.
- Is that why everyone's on high alert?

796
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,654
Why didn't you tell me?

797
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,864
Somebody let me out of here so I can help!

798
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,741
- Open the door!
- What are you going to do?

799
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,452
Tell them that some archangel took her?

800
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,204
We are on the same side here.

801
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,539
Only we can save her,

802
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:07,334
and the only way you can help
is by telling me where you saw Michael.

803
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,503
You're hurting me.

804
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,631
[gasps]

805
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:18,928
Okay.

806
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,014
Okay...

807
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,099
Michael...

808
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:26,312
He came to me at the cemetery.

809
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,482
But then he... He flew me someplace else.

810
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,360
Uh, someplace private so we could talk.

811
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:34,612
It was, uh...

812
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,572
It was some weird cave.

813
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:39,742
Private? Well, that might be
where he has Chloe. Where's this cave?

814
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:42,036
Well, I-I-I don't know exactly.

815
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,246
How can you not know?
Did he blindfold you?

816
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,915
Well, I kind... I-I kind of...

817
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:50,127
maybe passed out on the flight there.

818
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:52,504
- And back.
- [sighs]

819
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,965
You have got to be kidding me!

820
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,885
Come on, I'm afraid of heights.
You know what roller coasters do to me.

821
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:02,181
And believe me, flying is...
It's way worse.

822
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,144
Is there anything of value
that you can tell me,

823
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,185
or are you just completely useless?

824
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:10,022
Look, the cave, it was strange, all right?
It was... It was...

825
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:11,690
Parts of it, it looked fake.

826
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,193
There were... There were bars on it,

827
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:16,737
and it seemed like nobody had been there
in a really...

828
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,822
really long time.

829
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:30,084
[metal door opening]

830
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:36,674
[man grunts]

831
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:38,342
[panting]

832
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:39,842
[gasps]

833
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:43,889
Maze, Dan, what are you doing here?

834
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:48,143
That's a pretty mighty swing
you've got there, Detective.

835
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,313
Are all abandoned zoos this dangerous?

836
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,024
Lucifer...

837
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,115
[both kissing, moaning]

838
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:06,120
I'm so sorry. I thought you were Michael.

839
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,705
Oh, it's okay.

840
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,790
You can whack me anytime.

841
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:11,959
[sighs]

842
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,045
He really does care about her, doesn't he?

843
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:18,464
Yeah.

844
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,176
Freaking soulmates.

845
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:28,851
Good news.

846
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,063
Charlie's fever has subsided.

847
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,107
Just your normal, run-of-the-mill cold.

848
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,358
[both sighing]

849
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,235
- Ready to see him?
- Yes.

850
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:39,403
Right this way.

851
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,200
Hello, brother.

852
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:47,952
Michael?

853
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:51,582
What are you doing here?

854
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:55,169
I heard that Charlie was sick,
so I came to show my support.

855
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,171
Yeah. "Support"?

856
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,715
Despite our differences,
we're still family,

857
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:02,509
and that includes Charlie.

858
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:05,846
And I heard the doctor say it was
just a normal cold.

859
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,765
I'm... I'm so sorry.

860
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:11,393
What do you mean "sorry," Michael?
That's good news.

861
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:15,939
But, brother, you understand
what that means, right?

862
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:18,025
No, what?

863
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,610
[sighs]

864
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:27,868
Honey, I'm home!

865
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:30,370
Surprised to see me?

866
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:33,831
[chuckles]

867
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,627
No, actually, Mazikeen,

868
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,338
you are exactly the demon I wanted to see.

869
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:40,589
In fact,

870
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:42,841
you're a little earlier than I expected.

871
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:46,470
I am so tired
of your bullshit games, Michael.

872
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,807
Tired of you messing with me
and my friends.

873
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:51,475
Kidnapping Chloe...

874
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,186
that was a step too far.

875
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:57,481
Now I'm going to have a little fun
carving you up.

876
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,359
Come on.

877
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,529
That's a little extreme, don't you think?
I mean,

878
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:06,490
I was never going to hurt Chloe.

879
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:09,952
You don't believe me?

880
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:16,458
Mazikeen, I am the only one
who has been honest with you.

881
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,504
Who told you about the ring?

882
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:23,173
All that did was show me
how much my life sucks.

883
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:26,927
Which is exactly why
I wanted to talk to you.

884
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,473
Listen, I can help you,

885
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,433
because when I get what I want,

886
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:35,227
so can you.

887
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:40,065
And we are so close, Mazikeen,

888
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:44,236
so, so close to my plan
finally coming together.

889
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:58,208
I just want to say how grateful I am
for all of your hard work and...

890
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:02,588
for never giving up on trying to find me,
and, um...

891
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:08,176
you know, words cannot
express this enough, but...

892
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,141
thank you.

893
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,269
Thank you, guys.

894
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:18,853
Thank you.

895
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,861
Brother! Brother, we need to talk.

896
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:28,246
Something terrible has happened
with Charlie.

897
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,323
What, did he get worse?

898
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:32,242
No! No, he got better,

899
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,452
but it's just...

900
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,788
It's just a normal cold.

901
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,417
[chuckles] Right, well,
I don't see the problem.

902
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,835
That's what I've been saying.

903
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,147
- No, listen, we really have to...
- No, I'm sorry, brother,

904
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,631
but I'm a little busy at the moment.

905
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:48,008
The detective and I
haven't yet had a chance to talk.

906
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:49,509
Can this wait?

907
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:53,805
- No! This is...
- Yes! Yes, it can. Come on.

908
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,933
I... [scoffs lightly]

909
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:57,225
Hi.

910
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:58,143
Hi.

911
00:48:58,226 --> 00:48:59,686
- Hey.
- Hi.

912
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:01,438
Uh... Um...

913
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:03,732
Can we talk?

914
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:05,734
Somewhere private?

915
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,862
Yeah. Of course.

916
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:10,947
Here.

917
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:12,449
How's Ella doing?

918
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:14,075
She's, uh...

919
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,995
She's as well as could be expected.

920
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,997
She's happy that you're safe, but...

921
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,625
[sighs] Poor Ella.

922
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,168
I feel terrible for her.

923
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,170
I'll check in with her later.

924
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:27,964
Detective...

925
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,343
I am so incredibly sorry.

926
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:33,971
For what?

927
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:37,182
For taking so long to find you,

928
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:39,893
for getting you caught up
in my family mess,

929
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:43,355
for everything you had to endure
with my psycho twin brother.

930
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:45,357
Lucifer, everybody has a weird family.

931
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,776
- [scoffs]
- I'm not gonna lie,

932
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,445
it wasn't fun being kidnapped, but...

933
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:53,782
I knew you were out there

934
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:56,076
the whole time, looking for me.

935
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:01,164
What I'm worried about now
is Michael, he...

936
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:04,459
He said that this was all part
of some bigger plan and...

937
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,129
Sh-Sh-Should we go find him?

938
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:10,215
Well, I'll deal with him later.
Right now I'm just...

939
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,968
I'm just happy to have you back.

940
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:14,761
[both sighing]

941
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:17,596
Well...

942
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,392
But from what I heard,
you really didn't need me.

943
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,561
You caught a serial killer on your own?

944
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:27,524
Uh, well, Maze and Miss Lopez helped a bit
but, yes, I suppose it was mostly me.

945
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:28,817
[laughs]

946
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,527
And you, in a way.

947
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,280
- What?
- I channeled you, Detective.

948
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:36,658
Did some actual case work.
I really was my best you.

949
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,994
Oh! And my best me.

950
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,371
By the way, my mojo's back.

951
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:42,872
Isn't that great?

952
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:45,667
- Really?
- Yeah.

953
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,421
Yeah, that's... That is great.

954
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:52,131
What's wrong?

955
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,676
Nothing. Nothing.

956
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,844
- Uh...
- [scoffs]

957
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:57,012
I just...

958
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,807
Do you think I can still mojo you?

959
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,560
Well, there's no need.
I promise to tell you everything I desire,

960
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:04,643
no mojo required.

961
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:07,147
That's assuming you know what you want.

962
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,231
Excuse me?

963
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:12,693
[inhales]

964
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,989
I'm just wondering...

965
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:20,077
if subconsciously you might be
pushing me away,

966
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,163
'cause you say that you want this and...

967
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:25,290
you say that you want us, but...

968
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:27,292
But do you?

969
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:29,002
Where is this coming from?

970
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,754
Well, if, mojo-wise,

971
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:32,881
you're no longer letting me in,

972
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:35,175
if, if now, you're...

973
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:37,761
invulnerable all the time,

974
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,763
doesn't that mean that you're...

975
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:43,809
no longer choosing
to be vulnerable with me?

976
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:45,977
I know what's happened here.

977
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:48,647
Michael got inside your head, didn't he?
What did he say to you?

978
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,732
You know he taps into people's fears.

979
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:53,443
And, yeah, I...

980
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:56,738
- Yes, I guess part of me is afraid.
- Of what?

981
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,281
Um...

982
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,285
Afraid that you don't...

983
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:05,956
feel the same way that I feel about you.

984
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:07,039
What?

985
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:08,415
And...

986
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:10,961
the last thing I want to do is

987
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,839
push you into saying something
you don't want to,

988
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,215
but I know you can't lie.

989
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,304
So just tell me, is that...

990
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:24,891
why you haven't said it back?

991
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:27,519
Haven't said what back?

992
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,984
- Oh...
- [Chloe sniffles]

993
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,444
I... [exhales]

994
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,363
But Detective, I...

995
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:40,949
It's... It's complicated.

996
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:44,786
- [sniffles] All right.
- No, I-I-I mean...

997
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:47,622
Detective, I do, of course I do.

998
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:48,915
- It's...
- Right, right.

999
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,584
No, Dete... Chloe.

1000
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:55,421
I...

1001
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:00,092
I lo...

1002
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:06,725
Detective?

1003
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:13,772
What?

1004
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:35,545
Amenadiel!

1005
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:40,842
Brother!

1006
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:44,471
Could you have chosen a worse moment
to slow down time?

1007
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,890
It hasn't slowed, it's stopped!

1008
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:49,893
Well, would you kindly
unstop it, then, please?

1009
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:52,771
Lucy, look. Just... look.

1010
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,231
He's frozen.

1011
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:57,567
Charlie. Charlie's frozen.

1012
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:02,239
Yes, as is everything and everyone else,
including the detective.

1013
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:04,991
Exactly. Everyone but us celestials.

1014
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:08,036
- Do you understand what that means?
- I...

1015
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:09,704
It means Michael was right.

1016
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,166
Charlie is... is mortal.

1017
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:15,335
And?

1018
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:18,964
And all of this time I thought...

1019
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,469
I assumed he was like me, like us.

1020
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:25,971
But he's not.

1021
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:30,392
He's just like every other
ordinary human child.

1022
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:31,726
He'll get sick again,

1023
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:33,895
he'll feel pain,

1024
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,563
grow old, suffer!

1025
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:39,526
Oh. Right, now I understand.

1026
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:43,029
You stopped time to prevent
all that from happening.

1027
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:45,155
Well,

1028
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:48,576
would you deal with
your parental anxieties later?

1029
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,412
Right now I need you
to hit the play button

1030
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:52,122
because I have a relationship to fix!

1031
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:53,456
I have no idea how!

1032
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:56,209
- Well...
- I didn't do anything to make this happen!

1033
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:59,170
Not consciously, obviously, but this is
clearly triggered by your fears,

1034
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:02,007
so just stop being afraid!

1035
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,175
Easier said than done.

1036
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:10,223
Amenadiel, I am impressed. [chuckles]

1037
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:14,436
I was hoping that you would
spiral out of control, but...

1038
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:17,063
completely stopping time? [laughs]

1039
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,858
Way to be an overachiever!

1040
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:24,029
Well, if it isn't
Mr. Bigger Plans himself.

1041
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,406
Of course you're behind this, too.

1042
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:29,451
How are you and the little lovebird doing?

1043
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:32,620
Hmm? Have you realized
it will never work yet?

1044
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:37,751
Look, I get going after me,
but why bring Amenadiel into this?

1045
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,419
What's your endgame here?

1046
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:42,797
Oh, you'll just have to wait and see.
And I didn't do anything to Amenadiel.

1047
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:47,427
I mean, I can't help it if he's afraid
of his son's snotty nose.

1048
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:52,974
Amenadiel, Michael is probably responsible
for Charlie's illness.

1049
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:54,726
Come on, I would never.

1050
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:55,809
He's lying.

1051
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:58,480
Amenadiel,

1052
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:03,276
what makes more sense,
that I somehow gave your child a cold,

1053
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:08,198
or that Chucky here got sick
because he's a frail, little mortal

1054
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:11,034
who's destined to suffer and die
a horrible human death?

1055
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:13,703
Amenadiel, Charlie's not going to die.

1056
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:16,164
- Now who's lying?
- I meant anytime soon.

1057
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:17,791
But they grow up so fast.

1058
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:20,434
Don't listen to him, brother.
Don't let him get inside your head.

1059
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,170
I'm just saying
what he's already thinking.

1060
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:25,256
[growls] Why? Why are you doing this?

1061
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,050
Oh, again with the blame game.

1062
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:30,345
It's not my fault you impregnated
one of these filthy little humans.

1063
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:34,766
[laughs]

1064
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:37,018
I mean, look at her.

1065
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:38,728
So helpless.

1066
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:41,731
Just like your son.

1067
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:44,859
- [roars]
- [woman grunts]

1068
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:47,529
[straining]

1069
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:54,284
Maze.

1070
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:56,454
Why are you defending him?

1071
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:58,373
Because he promised me a soul.

1072
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:01,000
[laughs] That's impossible.

1073
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,962
Why? Because I'm just a demon?

1074
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:05,630
Exactly.

1075
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:07,048
[roars]

1076
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:19,184
Get up.

1077
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,441
We're not done.

1078
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:29,612
Why would you ever trust Michael?
He's a liar!

1079
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,531
[grunting]

1080
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,577
He's only ever been honest with me.

1081
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,579
[both grunting]

1082
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:39,329
You...

1083
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,166
You hid my mother from me.

1084
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,417
How did you...

1085
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:49,924
I'm sorry, Maze,
but I gave Lilith my word.

1086
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:52,969
Which is apparently more important to you
than I am!

1087
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,846
- What?
- [yells]

1088
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:07,775
[both grunting]

1089
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,281
I can't believe you'd use
my infant son as a pawn!

1090
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:22,707
I can't believe how easy it was
triggering you! [giggles]

1091
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:26,211
I mean, way easier than turning
Lucifer's friends against him.

1092
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:37,013
[groans, laughs]

1093
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,193
[groans]

1094
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:06,042
[Michael panting]

1095
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,257
[groans]

1096
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:30,191
Mazikeen.

1097
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:40,410
[others grunting, shouting]

1098
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:03,391
[man] That's enough!

1099
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:16,613
Dad.

1100
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:24,287
Children.

1101
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,789
You know I hate it when you fight.
