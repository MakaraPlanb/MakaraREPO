Oh! All right.

8
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,960
I got that bubbly!

9
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,046
You want to join us?

10
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,006
Hell to the yeah!

11
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,842
Just let me slip into something
a little more comfortable.

12
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,094
Ooh!

13
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,349
[man] Hello.

14
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,893
[gasps]

15
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,812
I heard you were here,
so I thought I'd pay you a visit.

16
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:05,857
No, no, no way, man! You got to go!

17
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,526
Well, frankly, I was expecting
a tad warmer reception,

18
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,279
- Mr. Said Out Bitch.
- Don't get me wrong.

19
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:15,283
I am grateful for all the money
and the gold you gave me last time.

20
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,535
But I'm gonna have to catch you
on the flip side,

21
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,413
because for once,
things are going really well for me.

22
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:23,792
And every time I run into you,
bad things happen.

23
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,753
Right. Well, this is gonna
get awkward, then.

24
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,420
Why?

25
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,090
Something bad<i> is</i> about to happen,

26
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,550
but I assure you,
it has nothing to do with me.

27
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,927
What are you talking about?

28
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,806
Someone is about to walk
through that door and murder you.

29
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,015
Huh?

30
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,142

00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,355
You kill me! [laughs]

33
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,440
There ain't no way that's gonna happen.

34
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,775
Oh, I assure you,

35
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,110
it most certainly will happen.

36
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,738
In fact, it's happened
over 200 times already,

37
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,449
and it will happen again in five,

38
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,701

What the hell?

43
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,215
Precisely.

44
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:19,139
Victim is Lee Garner, 53, career criminal.

45
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,225
Armed robbery, burglary,
but mostly small-time stuff.

46
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,311
Although he might not be
so small-time anymore,

47
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,105
'cause this<i> Foshizzle</i> is all his.

48
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,064
This what?

49
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,441
The <i>Foshizzle.</i>
Name of the boat, <i>Foshizzle.</i>

50
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,652
- Oh. Cause of death?
- [police radios squawking]

51
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,446
Gunshot wound to the chest.
Oh, and if that wasn't messed up enough,

52
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,241
the killer also did this.

53
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,244
Clean cut at the wrist, post-mortem.

54
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,787
We're still looking for the hand.

55
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:45,831
What do you think?

56
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,374
Mm.

57
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,042
I think I boned him.

58
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,172
Maze, just because
you happened to have slept

59
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,174
with that one murder victim
a few weeks ago

60
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,937
doesn't mean that you slept with them all.

61
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,427
How am I supposed to keep up, Chloe?

62
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,888
With the murder victims
or the people you've slept with?

63
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:00,971
- Either.
- [Ella] Wow.

64
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,808
Maze is really settling into her role
as your new Lucifer.

65
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,311
Well, in her capacity as a bounty hunter
for the LAPD,

66
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,479
she has graciously been helping me

67
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,940
- with my cases.
- Yeah. It's like Lucifer never left.

68
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:12,942
But he did leave.

69
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,445
I mean, at least you guys
got to say goodbye.

70
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,530
Me? Ghosted completely.

71
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,448
And it's been what,

72
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,909
like, two months since he moved to Florida

73
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,304
- to help with his family's business?
- Mm-hmm. Florida, yes.

74
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,328
That's where he is.

75
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,207
[Ella] He hasn't responded to a single one
of my texts or DMs.

76
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,127
Not even that video I sent him
of the parakeet dancing to techno.

77
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,755
You guys, it, like, opens up its wings,
and it's like...

78

[grunts repeatedly]

79
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:39,594
[giggling] And he goes, like, side to side
and it's frigging hilarious, but...

80
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,931
As far as I'm concerned,
Lucifer can, well...

81
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,182
He can go to Hell.

82
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,603
You guys don't think
he's having work done, do you?

83
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,021
Hey, Ellen.

84
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:51,564
Read the room.

85
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,361
Chloe, I am so sorry.

86
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,488
I didn't mean to bring up the "L" word.
It's just...

87
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,491
It's just that I miss that crazy dude,
you know?

88
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,825
It's... It's okay.

89
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,702
I completely understand.

90
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,539
And to be honest,
I have been working so much...

91
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,042
We... <i>We've</i> been working so much,

92
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:14,963
I haven't even had a chance
to stop and think about it... really.

93
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,840
You know, I haven't even...
Haven't even thought about it.

94
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,843
Anyhow, speaking of work... Uh, any leads?

95
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,222
None yet, but I'll have more when
I get everything back to the lab.

96
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,182
Okay, great. Call me if anything comes up.

97
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,308
You got it.

98
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,685
Okay. Cool.

99
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:32,021
Until then, Maze, I do believe
we have other work to do.

113
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,581
Yeah, we just can't help it.

it's just been so much fun.

116
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,795
I'm starting to see why Lucifer enjoyed
spending so much time here.

117
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,173
Yeah. [forced chuckle]

118
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,094
Excuse me, ladies.

Oh!

120
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,144
Did I just witness a drug deal?

00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,355
No, man. Of course not.

Look.

00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:05,531
Lux is under new management,
which means new rules.

So, I didn't just die?

00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,440
Well, as I was trying to tell you
before we were so rudely interrupted,

132
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,901
you are now in your very own Hell loop.

133

So, welcome to Hell.

00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,195
I'm in Hell?

I... I don't understand.

136

Eternal damnation? Infinite suffering?
It's a pretty straightforward concept.

But why am I here?

Well, that's between you
and your own guilt.

It's what brought you here,

150
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:33,077
and it's what will torture you now
through the end of time.

151
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:37,290
And now we're crossing into the country
of Boring, so time for me to self-deport.

Please.

Wait, man.

155
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,379
You can't go.

156
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,214
You can't just leave me here alone.

157
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,549
No, you won't be alone.

158
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:51,012
My demons will always be on hand,
torturing you and such, so chin up, mate.

At least tell me who killed me.

160
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,099
Not my job anymore.

161
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:59,187
I'm sorry, but this really is
about you and your eternal pain,

162
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:00,854
okay?

163
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,735
But I had everything.

00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,574

in Marina del Rey,

165
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,034
women, money...

166
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,785
I had it all.

167

there's a good chance
I know who's on your case.

00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,393
We were quite a team, once upon a time.

173

I mean...

174
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,982
to them, it's only been a few months,
a blink of an eye,

175
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,692
but down here, it's been...

176
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,570
much, much longer.

177
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,116

It doesn't really seem like it.

179
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,871
I'm gonna do something
I haven't done in ages,

180
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,623
for old times' sake.

181
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,292
I am going to solve your murder.

182
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,099
So how is this gonna work?

183
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:21,328
Is the killer gonna come through that door
and shoot me again? 'Cause that hurt.

184
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:25,064
Usually, yes, but me being
the Lord of Hell does have its perks.

185
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,566
Oh, sh...

186
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,165
You see, everyone in your Hell loop
is played by a demon.

187
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,792
I have control over them.

188
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,712
Give us a wave, Belios.

189
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,171
What's up?

190
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:51,506
So,

191
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,342
if you can freeze them,

192
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,679
then it should be easy to figure out
who the killer is, right?

193
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,681
I mean, I can just lift this up and...

194
00:09:58,764 --> 00:09:59,807
Oh, shit!

195
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,643
Again, not that simple.

196
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,648
See, your Hell loop is made up
entirely of your own memories.

197
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:11,110
You never saw your killer's face,
hence a big nothing.

198
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,237
No offense, Belios.

199
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,115
And take the rest of the day off.
You've certainly earned it.

200
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,202
So, how are we gonna find my killer, then?

201
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,081
With good old-fashioned detective work,
<i>mon frère.</i>

202
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,542
And lucky for you,
I learned from the best.

203
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,377
So, step one.

204
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,380
Who wanted you dead? [chuckles]

205
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,258
[woman] <i>Lee owed a lot of people money.</i>

206
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,802
My brother always ran
with a sketchy crowd.

207
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,096
He'd spend money he didn't have,

208
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,682
get into debt, steal to pay it back.

209
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,600
[scoffs]

210
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:43,726
[Chloe] Mm.

211
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,104
Is it too bright in here for you,
Detective?

212
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,314
Oh. No.

213
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:52,693
No, I just have, like,
a light, um, sensitivity thing.

214
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,488
Um, so...
Uh, when they found your brother,

215
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:59,075
he was on a very expensive yacht
that he owned.

216
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,910
Maybe he turned his life around.

217
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,452
Yeah.

218
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,538
That'd be a first.

219
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,750
My brother was a magnet

220
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,627
for bad people, bad things.

221
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,338
He was forever stuck
in this vicious cycle.

222
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,340
He was probably just riding a high.

223
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,177
[sighs] He was bound to come down
sooner or later.

224
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,889
Do you have any idea why someone
would want to cut off his hand?

225
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,308
They cut off his hand?

226
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,561
My God, why?

227
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,772
It's what we're trying to figure out.

228
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,567
You don't recognize that
as any kind of message?

229
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,488
I haven't seen Lee in years.

230
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,283
I can't even say
I really knew the man anymore.

231
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:43,994
If that's a message...

232
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,123
it's not one that I know how to read.

233
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:49,625
[man grunts loudly]

234
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,293
Decker, got a lead.

235
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,420
[sighs]

236
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,467
Sit.

237
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,011
Tell her what you told me.

238
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,265
Ow! Okay.

239
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,101
[sighs deeply]

240
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:11,439
Word on the street is that Lee guy
got whacked by Dirty Doug.

241
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,358
Who the hell's Dirty Doug?

242
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:18,654
Doug Sargisian? Guy runs a mob-backed
high-stakes poker game at the H Club?

243
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,658
I heard from my boy K-Swiss,
who heard it from his boy 8-Ball,

244
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,493
that Lee owed him a bunch of money.

245
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,120
So Doug did him in,

246
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:29,331
and then cut off his hand
to send a message.

247
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:30,832
Um...

248
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,126
What's the message?

249
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,628
"If you don't pay up,
then you're, like, stealing"?

250
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,839
Kind of on the nose, if you ask me,

251
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,424
but hey, message received,

252
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:41,594
'cause I owe Dirty Doug
a ton of cash that I don't have.

253
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:46,557
All right? That's why I was bailing,
until Angry Bird here ended those plans.

254
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,855
[both sigh]

255
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,940
Looks like we're gonna need
to pay Doug a visit.

256
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,693
- A guy like Doug's gonna...
- Lawyer up?

257
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,652
First sign of police.

258
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,070
- We need...
- Leverage.

259
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,757
- I know what you're thinking.
- Might be the only way.

260
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,216
- [Maze] What about...
- It's dangerous.

261
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,960
- Then, what if we...
- He'll see it coming.

262
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:07,827
Huh.

263
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,371
I have an idea.

264
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,584
Absolutely not, Maze.

265
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,628
You should be ashamed of yourself.

266
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,338
Fine! Fine!

267
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,340
- We'll do it your way.
- Good.

268
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,217
So we agree to the plan?

269
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,259
Yeah.

270
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,887
We'll pose as high-end poker players,
get into the game,

271
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,097
get Doug to slip up, lean on him,
get him to confess.

272
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,516
[laughs]

273
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,850
Something funny?

274
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,101
Don't get me wrong.

275
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:34,688
You two snacks are welcome
at my card table anytime, hmm?

276
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:39,109
But Dirty Doug's game defines "exclusive."

277
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,486
All right? Invite-only, and...

278
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,988
y'all ain't getting invites.

279
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,576
I know someone
who could have gotten us an invite.

280
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:51,080
You don't need Lucifer,
and I don't need...

281
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,834
[groans]

282
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,878
<i>I</i> will get us an invite.

283
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,588
Right.

284
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,177
- Hey! Ella!
- Hi! How are you?

285
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,637
Thanks so much for coming.

286
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,098
Well, thanks so much for inviting me.

287
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,767
Yeah, I brought all the stuff
you requested,

288
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,186
but your message didn't say
why you needed it.

289
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,272
Well, it's for Charlie, of course.

290
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,109
Yeah, I was hoping that
you could teach him some science.

291
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:24,488
Yeah, I'm a firm believer
in a strong STEM foundation.

292
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,533
Oh, yeah. Science, technology,
engineering, math.

293
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,159
Super important.

294
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,702
[Charlie coos]

295
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,873
Isn't Charlie, like, two months old?

296
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,708
Oh, I know what you're thinking.

297
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,127
But Charlie is a special child.

298
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,755
Yeah. Every child is special
in their mom's eyes, huh?

299
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,592
Yeah, no, but Charlie's <i>actually </i>special.

300
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,719
- Yeah.
- That's why the classical music,

301
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,512
the science lessons, baby Pilates...

302
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,432
It's all to harness his full potential,
which is...

303
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:55,811
Which is something
the world has never seen.

304
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,062
Yeah.

305
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,522
Well, here. I'll show you.

306
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:00,857
Okay, Charlie.

307
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:04,820
Charlie, where's boron?

308
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,488
[chortles]

309
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,783
See? Yes! That's...

310
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,286
Yes, babasquat, that's it! That's it!

311
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,245
- Yes.
- Oh!

312
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,122
See, that's boron.

313
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:19,960
Wow! Yeah, that was... amazing.

314
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,504
Yeah! Having children is such a gift.

315
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,049
Have you ever thought about having kids?

316
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:26,800
Um...

317
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,721
Sure, yeah, I guess, I mean,
but, uh, you know...

318
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:34,391
kind of missing the dude part
of the equation at the moment,

319
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:38,562
and, huh, this <i>chica</i> has
terrible taste in men.

320
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,358
Drawn to the bad boys for some reason.

321
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,109
[Charlie chortles]

322
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,029
But you know, for once I'm thinking...

323
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,783
I deserve a good guy, you know?

324
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:55,245
So, science lessons.
Wednesdays at 11:00 a.m.?

325
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,539
I checked your schedule,
and that's your day off.

326
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,211
Sure, yeah. Wednesdays are great.

327
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,849
What is that smell?

328
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,226
Success.

329
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,603
Essential oils, man.

330
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,522
What you're smelling is called Success.

331
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,285
I'm all out of Strength,
but if you want...

332
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,763
I can hook you up with some Hope.

333
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,821
It does wonders.

334
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,114
No, I'm good.

335
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,533
You sure? Come on,
everybody needs a little bit of Hope.

336
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,201
- I'm good.
- No? Okay.

337
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,619
All right, all right, all right.

338
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:39,873
So I see you're really diving into this,
uh, whole self-improvement thing.

339
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,584
Oh, yeah, man. Yeah, I was in a bad place.

340
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,712
Dealing with a bunch of guilt and stuff.

341
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:45,795
But you know what?

342
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,840
I started to work on myself,

343
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,258
and it was such an awakening.

344
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:53,846
We've never even scratched the surface
of our true human potential.

345
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,057
- You ever CrossFit?
- No.

346
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,767
Aw, come on! No!

347
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,103
But, listen, I want you to know,
Dan, that I think

348
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,272
all of this personal reflection is a...

349
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,398
It's a really good thing.

350
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,150
Well, thank you, man. Thank you.

351
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,652

this is a good case, Dan.

00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,859
I don't know,
you're the one that stored it.

530
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,528
Wait, I stored it?

531
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:14,573
Yeah, it's safe where you stored it...
Oh, crap.

532
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,075
This body's too jacked up to keep working.

533
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:18,410
- But you got this...
- [gasps]

534
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,913
Hey, is that Mazikeen?

535
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:22,997
Wait, wait!

536
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:24,541
[Ella] Decker...

537
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,418
What the hell? Did you move the body?

538
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,127
[sighs]

539
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,006
[Lucifer] So, that's that.

540
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,301
Gromos assures me
the message was delivered.

541
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:38,305
So your demon just jumped
into that dead guy's body?

542
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,683
And told the detective
what she needs to know

543
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,811
in order to arrest whoever was
behind your murder.

544
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:46,021
No need to thank me.

545
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:49,149
So, back to your torture.

546
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,234
And me to mine.

547
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:54,528
Hey, man. Um...

548
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,991
you keep talking about a detective.

549
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:00,909
Who is she?

550
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,829
Someone I left behind...

551
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,956
a very long time ago.

552
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,375
Seems like somebody pretty important.

553
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,254
More than you could ever know.

554
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,300
Hell, I get it.

555
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,719
I left people behind, too.

556
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,512
People I care about, like...

557
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:21,681
my sister, Meg.

558
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:26,144
You know, she meant the world to me,
and I let her go.

559
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,563
Now it's too late.

560
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,443
What's your detective's name?

561
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:34,526
Well...

562
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:37,906
I just used to call her "Detective,"
but...

563
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,157
her name...

564
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,288
Clever, manipulative bastard.

565
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,083
Well played.

566
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,419
Petty distraction
to gain the Devil's sympathy,

567
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,881
hoping I'll let you off the hook
from your endless torment, huh?

568
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,342
- Ah, man, it ain't like that!
- [Lucifer scoffs]

569
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:00,929
You just seem like a really sad devil guy.

570
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:08,770
I mean, okay,

571
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,898
you know, maybe a small part of me
was hoping that you'd help me out.

572
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,858
How many times do I have to tell you

573
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,695
before it penetrates
that minuscule mind of yours?

574
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,364
This whole thing is your own fault!

575
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:20,907
You know what, man? Screw you!

576
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,326
I mean, you would help me out
if you wanted to.

577
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,787
Thought you were supposed to be
the man down here.

578
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,330
Ain't you the "King of Hell"?

579
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:30,709
You really want to know why you're here?

580
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,501
Do you?

581
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,338
Well, let me show you.

582
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,427
- Ta-da! We made it.
- Oh! Shh!

583
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,804
Uh, Charlie's just in the middle
of his Japanese lesson.

584
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,097
- Oh.
- Yeah.

585
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,849
Sorry. We'll be extra quiet.

586
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,101
[Japanese language on speaker]

587
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:51,813
Listen, thank you so much for watching
Trixie. It's just for a little bit.

588
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,690
And I've been dying to see the baby.

589
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,483
- [Dan chuckles]
- Yeah, no, of course.

590
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,485
You know,
Charlie's just so good with children.

591
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,654
Also, I've been meaning
to return these to you.

592
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:00,738
Oh, okay.

593
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,323
Thank you for letting me borrow them.

594
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,451
- Wow, so you read all of them?
- Mm-hmm.

595
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,995
Yeah. Powered through them
pretty quick, actually.

596
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,078
So insightful.

597
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,040
I'm really enjoying learning
to live my own truth.

598
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,333
Do you have any more?

599
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:16,546
Well, this is all the self-help books
<i>I</i> have.

600
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:21,718
Maybe let these, you know,
simmer for a bit first.

601
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,177
Maybe.

602
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,096
[Japanese dialogue on speaker]

603
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:26,764
[inhales sharply]

604
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:27,848
Japanese, huh?

605
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,310
Yeah, well, Charlie got
a little tuckered out from yoga,

606
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,812
so we had to reschedule
Art Appreciation at MOCA

607
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,482
for some low-impact language immersion.

608
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,858
Wow, that is some schedule.

609
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,860
I know, I know. It's a lot of work,

610
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:42,030
but it's all about raising
the best child possible.

611
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,281
He's special.

612
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,699
Yeah. [chuckles]

613
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,243
We all think our own kid
can walk on water, right?

614
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:48,912
I hadn't thought of that.

615
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,791
Cancel swimming lessons.

616
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,124
[chuckles]

617
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:58,671
You know, one of the things

618
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,508
that I've learned from all this work
that I've been doing,

619
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:02,925
and being a dad...

620
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,803
- Yeah.
- ...is that the best part of life,

621
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:05,887
being a parent,

622
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,139
is that you get to slow down and enjoy it.

623
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,393
Linda, make sure to be present
in the moment.

624
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,311
Oh, I am.

625
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,834
- Totally present.
- [Charlie laughs]

626
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,689
Wait, what's that sound?

627
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,234
[Trixie giggles]

628
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,739
[Charlie laughing]

629
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,367
That's the first time he's laughed.

630
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:28,993
Two months.

631
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:30,829
That is pretty advanced.

632
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,706
It's easy. He just likes silly faces.

633
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,791
[Dan chuckles]

634
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:52,183
Prints off our squashed possum
came back to Vernon Gill, 37,

635
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:55,353
known hit man, working contracts
for small-time criminal organizations,

636
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,981
and my hunch was on point.

637
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:01,442
Striations from the gun I found on him
match the bullet that killed Lee Garner.

638
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,821
And I also found 20 grand in cash
in the trunk of that guy's car.

639
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,906
That's the going rate for a contract hit.

640
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,450
So Gill pulled the trigger,
but then who paid him to kill Lee?

641
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,345
- Maybe Dirty Doug hired him?
- [Maze] Doubtful.

642
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,787
I spoke to Ellen's boyfriend.

643
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,139
- He's not...
- He came in last night,

644
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:17,041
and Gill said he threatened him
for taking credit for Lee's murder.

645
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,793
Said it was "bad for business."

646
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,003
Then he joined a poker game.

647
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,421
Someone else hired Gill.

648
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,924
Huh. Okay. Um, well, I...

649
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:26,968
may have a lead.

650
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:29,679
You found a lead without me? Where?

651
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,433
Um, I can't exactly say.

652
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,268
[Ella] Oh!

653
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:38,062
Confidential informant. [clicks tongue]
Right.

654
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,815
- Sure.
- You got to protect your peeps.

655
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,775
- Ride or die, man. Respect.
- Yes.

656
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,736
So about this lead.

657
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,070
[Chloe] Yes. It...

658
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:52,076
"It's safe where you stored it."

659
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,161
Where I stored what?

660
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,246
Wait, did you store it
or did she store it?

661
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,623
"You stored it, and it's safe."

662
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,666
- What did I store, though?
- No, not you.

663
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,919
Who stored what? I'm so confused.

664
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,128
I'm confused, too.

665
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,379
That's why I'm sharing this.

666
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:06,799
"You stored it."
"You stored it," "You stored it..."

667
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,801
Yes! I knew that sounded familiar.

668
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:09,885
"You stored..."

669
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,387
Lee's credit card statements.

670
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,766
He was making regular payments
to a storage facility in Pacoima called...

671
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,142
You Stored It!

672
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:18,770
Amazing. Good.
All right, let's go check it out.

673
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,396
So what CI gave you this lead?

674
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,609
[clears throat]

675
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:29,989
Something very weird happened
with Gill's corpse.

676
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,293
[Lee] Hmm.

677
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,588
I used to have a car just like this.

678
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:46,672
Ah...

679
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:49,676
This is my car.

680
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,220
Where are we?

681
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,389
The root of your Hell loop.

682
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,102
Oh, no, not here.

683
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,271
[partygoers laughing]

684
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,274
So why didn't you tell me about the demon?

685
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,902
Maimed bodies, demons from Hell...

686
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,779
It's kind of my jam, Chloe.

687
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:12,824
Yeah, I'm sorry.
It just happened really fast,

688
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:15,910
and it caught me off guard
hearing from Lucifer like that.

689
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,247
It's open.

690
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,117
- [Chloe gasps]
- [Maze grunts]

691
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,141
[Maze yells]

692
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,436
[woman yelps]

693
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,605
- [Chloe] Meg?
- [Meg panting]

694
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,365
[dance music plays]

695
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,455
[Amenadiel] <i>All right, Kyle.</i>

696
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,582
If you're gonna keep selling
in my place, man,

697
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,667
why don't we lay down some ground rules?

698
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,170
I prefer the way
the old management did things.

699
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,296
[Amenadiel] Hm.

700
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,798
It was more of a hands-off policy.

701
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,467
The past is the past, Kyle.

702
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,927
I'm here to talk about the future, bro.

703
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,638
So I suggest you evolve.

704
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,726
So how is this supposed to work, then?

705
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:25,605
Going forward, I'm gonna take
20% off the top of everything you sell.

706
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:26,688
That's the deal.

707
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:28,816
That's the only deal.

708
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:32,778
Whatever.

709
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,406
This place is bumping so hard,

710
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,283
we're both gonna make a killing.

711
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,410
Not so fast, little man.

712
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:42,288
If you're going to be selling drugs
in my place,

713
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:45,833
see, I need to know
that it's top-shelf product, you feel me?

714
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,335
I feel you.

715
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,836
All right, let's see it.

716
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,139
There's more where that came from.

717
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,266
Looks like good drugs.

718
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,852
Police! Show me your hands.

719
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:05,937
Show me your hands!

720
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,398
Don't move.

721
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,444
What the hell?

722
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,114
Who's your supplier?

723
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,157
Kyle? Tell me!

724
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,325
There...

725
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,535
is none.

726
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,994
Where'd you get the drugs from?

727
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,037
My mom.

728
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,749
She just had back surgery.

729
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,292
There's nothing here.

730
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,170
Just the one baggie.

731
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:36,384
You just said there was more, so where?

732
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,261
I was maybe gonna hit up my grandpa.

733
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:39,387
[sighs]

734
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,473
He's getting his gallbladder removed.

735
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,200
Dan, I was just trying
to make the world...

736
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,703
a safer place for...

737
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:04,786
For Charlie.

738
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:08,373
Yeah.

739
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,211
It's a crazy thing, being a parent.

740
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,506
When Trixie was born...

741
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,466
I tried to be Supercop...

742
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,219
and round up all the criminals I could.

743
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,889
Then I realized...

744
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:26,559
removing all the danger in the world
is like trying to bottle up the ocean.

745
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,148
You want to keep Charlie safe?

746
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,484
Just be there for him.

747
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,571
Be a good dad.

748
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,413
How could you bring me here?

749
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,082
So you recognize it?

750
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,419
Of course you do, it's your memories.

751
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,004
This is my parents' house.

752
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,966
The house I grew up in.

753
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,970
I haven't been here in 15 years.

754
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,055
[sighs]

755
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:05,722
Meg...

756
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,559
She just had a baby, my niece.

757
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:11,979
This was her baby shower.

758
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,609
I mean, this was the last time
my whole family got together.

759
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,821
My mom, she got sick right after it.

760
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:23,949
She died.

761
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,620
My dad followed right after.

762
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,169
This was my last chance,

763
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,380
and I didn't go inside.

764
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,969
[Meg] I found this place
and these credit card receipts.

765
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,554
I kept wondering
why they would take his hand.

766
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,266
Then I saw the biometric safe.

767
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,601
They used his hand to open it.

768
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,395
Must have been where he kept
all his money.

769
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,108
[exhales] The safe at You Stored It.

770
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:59,831
That's what Lucifer was trying to tell me.
It's all about the safe.

771
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,237
Who else knew about it?

772
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,530
I don't know. Um...

773
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,284
His old crew, maybe?
He was pretty tight with them.

774
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:09,912
Someone must have hired Gill to kill Lee
and use his hand to get the money.

775
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,887
And what were you gonna do with that gun?

776
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,959
I heard you guys coming. I freaked.

777
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:17,169
I grabbed Lee's gun to defend myself.

778
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,629
I thought it might have been...

779
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:22,300
[sighs] I don't know,
his killer coming back?

780
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,847
Honestly, I don't know what I would've
done if it had been Lee's killer.

781
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,682
I was just so angry.

782
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:34,103
It's a lot of legwork to do for a brother
that you've already written off.

783
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:36,771
[Meg] Yeah.

784
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,858
I kept telling myself it didn't matter,

785
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:41,402
I didn't care that he was gone, but, uh...

786
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,780
his death's drugged up a lot of emotions.

787
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,242
- The truth is...
- That you still miss him?

788
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:52,955
I spent every day expecting him
to walk through the door.

789
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,751
Guess now I finally have to accept
he's never coming home.

790
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,839
All right. I'll take you home.

791
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,636
I'd like to grab some of Lee's things,
if that's okay.

792
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:10,513
Yeah, go ahead.

793
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:15,561
[Maze] So what's next?
We gonna crack some skulls,

794
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:16,896
track down Lee's old crew?

795
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:21,067
Uh, Maze, actually, I think
I want to, um...

796
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:25,363
just take a beat to process some things.

797
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,198
What's wrong?

798
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:32,661
Well, I-I think that I've been avoiding
dealing with the fact that

799
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,413
Lucifer isn't coming back.

800
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:35,997
Or...

801
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,667
you figured out that you don't need him.

802
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,797
<i>We</i> don't need him,

803
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:44,673
or anyone.

804
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,634
Chloe, you and I...

805
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,135
We're good.

806
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:51,679
Maze...

807
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:55,725
[chuckles nervously]

808
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,480
The thing is, I'm... I'm not good.

809
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,066
And I don't think you're good, either.

810
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,903
I-I don't know exactly what happened
with you and Eve...

811
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,071
This isn't about Eve.

812
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:08,863
But...

813
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,740
Okay, this is...

814
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:14,161
This isn't about Eve, this is about
what's right in front of us.

815
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,330
Right here, right now, you and me.

816
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,457
Maze, I know what it feels like
to be abandoned.

817
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:22,169
You know, I mean, I've been
throwing myself into work, and...

818
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,922
going out with you so that...

819
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,591
I don't have to face it and...

820
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,973
I just think maybe you and I are using
this partnership to fill a void

821
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,933
that someone else has left behind.

822
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:38,852
So...

823
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:45,025
I-I think that it's best
if we step back...

824
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,570
from working together.

825
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,240
Yeah.

826
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,451
Good idea.

827
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,040
[Lucifer] <i>Ah, the wonders of Hell.</i>

828
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,376
So, your sister's baby shower, huh?

829
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,380
What a joyous occasion,
full of warmth and happiness.

830
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,965
Truly a celebration of life.

831
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,884
So go on, then. Go inside.

832
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,636
I-I can't.

833
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,848
Of course you can. It'd be so simple.
Just open the door and walk in.

834
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,947
- They don't want me in there.
- But they invited you, didn't they?

835
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,016
Well, they didn't mean it.

836
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,271
Oh, come on. Excuses!

837
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:23,272
They're like arseholes,

838
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,275
everybody's got one,
but nobody wants to hear it.

839
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,235
- I'm not making excuses for anything.
- No?

840
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,988
Well, your whole family is in there,
yet you're here.

841
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:32,906
Why?

842
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,367
Is it because you're afraid?

843
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:37,994
Afraid?

844
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,332
Why would I be afraid
to see my own family?

845
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,083
'Cause you know

846
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,794
if you go through that door,
it's only a matter of time

847
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:48,339
before you screw up again, isn't it?

848
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:53,844
Might take two days, two months,
two years, but it's gonna happen.

849
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:57,181
You're gonna rob a bank or steal a car,

850
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:58,807
pawn a family heirloom.

851
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,434
It is inevitable.

852
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:04,230
Sooner or later,
you are going to disappoint them

853
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:06,732
all over again!

854
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,490
And so you'd rather stay away
for all eternity.

855
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,035
You're right.

856
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,623
It's true, all of it.

857
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:24,958
It is.

858
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:33,509
Hey, this isn't just about me, is it?

859
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,596
Whose Hell is this anyway?

860
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:46,063
And then Lee took me to see <i>Saw.</i>

861
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,774
It was our first R-rated movie.

862
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,400
I was...

863
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,283
[shotgun cocks]

864
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,202
You, put your gun on the counter.

865
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:02,704
[Chloe] All right.

866
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:05,958
Do it now.

867
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,876
Let's just all stay calm.

868
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:14,299
You're Rod.

869
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,552
You used to room with Lee.

870
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:18,762
Did you kill him?

871
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,931
That loser brother of yours
gave us no choice.

872
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,225
He still owes us our cut
from our last job.

873
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,352
Now, where's the money from the safe?

874
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:26,937
You don't have it?

875
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,857
The safe was empty when we got there.

876
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:32,276
[laughs]

877
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:33,527
What the hell's so funny?

878
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:36,322
I mean, of course it's gone.

879
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:37,656
You knew my brother.

880
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,200
He probably thought
he could double it at a casino, or,

881
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,828
I don't know,
spend it on that stupid boat.

882
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,415
Quit stalling and give us the money.

883
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:47,499
I've got the money.

884
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,044
It's right here.

885
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,337
It's in the bag.

886
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,590
[grunts]

887
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:57,759
[handgun clicks]

888
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,136
Get down!

889
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,984
Are you sure this is my Hell?

890
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:19,073
- Well, who else's would it be?
- I don't know,

891
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,283
but I'm thinking you're just here
torturing yourself.

892
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,452
[chuckles] Preposterous.

893
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:27,289
Have you forgotten this is your Hell loop?
How does this have anything to do with me?

894
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:28,540
I'm just saying.

895
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:31,960
You could have chose any moment
to torture me, but you chose this one.

896
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:34,880
But that's because this is obviously
the most painful moment for you.

897
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:38,092
Right, and for sure this doesn't
resonate with you at all.

898
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:40,260
This has nothing to do with me.

899
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,138
I am here because I'm the King of Hell.

900
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,182
This is my job. This is my duty.

901
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:47,101
Now who's making excuses?

902
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:50,187
But I should know, right?

903
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,815
I mean, I spent my whole life making them,

904
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:59,571
and a million bullshit reasons why I went
15 years without talking to my family.

905
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:04,159
I mean, the truth is I should have just
got out of the damn car

906
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:06,453
and walked through that door.

907
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,749
I missed my chance.

908
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:12,626
What about you?

909
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:15,586
[scoffs]

910
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:21,510
The self-centered simplicity of you humans
never ceases to amaze me.

911
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:27,558
How can you presume
to compare yourself to me?

912
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,187
I am here out of responsibility.

913
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,314
Demons were in full revolt.

914
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,275
I had to protect humanity!

915
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:38,318
- I had to protect her!
- [man] Lord Morningstar.

916
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,445
What!

917
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,488
He's got news about that detective.

920
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:47,994
Come here.

921
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:52,249
They're gonna stop shooting
and they're gonna have to reload.

922
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:53,542
That's when you're gonna run.

923
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:54,960
I'll draw their fire. You ready?

924
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,670
No, no, no, I can't.
No, I can't!

925
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,255
Meg, listen to me.

926
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,300
You can do this.
We're not gonna die here. Get ready.

927
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:12,895
[man whistling]

928
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,062
[Rod] What the hell?

929
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:18,066
Hello, bad guys.

930
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,527
[Rod] Who's this crazy fool?

931
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,988
[Lucifer]
I hope I'm not late to the party.

00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,730
Thought you could use a hand, but...

936
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:58,941
looks like someone beat me to it.

937
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:03,528
[exhales deeply]

938
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,425
Lucifer, is everything okay?

939
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,052
You seem different.

940
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,808
Well, for you,
it's only been a couple of months,

941
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,269
but down there, time is different.

942
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,856
For me it's been thousands of years.

943
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,818
But the only thing that kept me going...

944
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,029
was thinking of you.
