00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:16,599
[Linda] That's pretty cool, Maze.

2
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,643
You're growing a soul.

3
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,478
Amazing. [chuckles]

4
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:23,273
And God told you. Wow.

5

[Mazikeen on phone]
<i>Well, he didn't "tell" tell me.</i>

6
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:29,988
<i>I was complaining that a demon can't
grow a soul, and God said, "Can't she?"</i>

7
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:31,364
<i>Annoyingly vague, I know,</i>

8
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:35,577
<i>but there was this glint
in his eye, and I just knew.</i>

9
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,662
<i>I had no idea
growing a soul was an option.</i>

10
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:40,874
<i>I mean, I was looking for one
like it was a thing I could eat, maybe,</i>

11
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:43,710
<i>or a shimmery cloud
that you could breathe in or something,</i>

12
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:49,424
<i>but, nope, I grew it inside my body,
like a little soul baby.</i>

13
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:52,969
Well, having seen a glimpse
into how Lucifer's father works,

14
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,930
I guess it... It makes sense, right?

15
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:59,559
<i>Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, right, yeah,
that self-actualization bullshit.</i>

16
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,479
<i>But now my question is,
am I done growing it?</i>

00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,818
<i>Uh, Linda, are you listening?</i>

19
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,945
Uh, yes, Maze, of course.

20
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,906
So, do you feel done?

21
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:15,325
<i>God, therapists...</i>

22
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,453

Hey, I can't talk right now.

26
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,813
<i>- You're doing it, aren't you?</i>
- What?

27
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,148
<i>Don't even think about lying to me, Linda.</i>

28
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:50,777
<i>I told you this was a mistake.
You are going to get hurt.</i>

29
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,571
- I know what I'm doing.

30
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,554
Just raise up the tip.

31
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,182
Ahh.

32
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,393
Hello, sailor.

33
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,603
What on <i>earth</i> are you doing?

34
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:30,233
Enough with these
silly distractions, Lucy.

35
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,985
Excuse me!

36
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:35,864
The impossible bottle is a time-honored
craft of which I was recently reminded.

37
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:39,033
Mm-hmm. And what about
the prank you pulled on poor Dan?

38
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,161
Very important business.

39
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:46,207
It took weeks to plan,
and, uh, now that it's over,

40
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,293
I think I'm gonna learn the French horn.

41
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:51,129
Been meaning to do that. [plays off-key]

42
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:54,048
Lucy. Lu... Lucifer!

43
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,093
We need to discuss Father.

44
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:01,890
God might be retiring, Lucy. God.

45
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,933
We need to figure out
what to do if he does.

46
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,351
Oh, that.

47
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,689
Well, if I have been avoiding something,
it's certainly not that.

48
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:13,443
Don't get your feathers in a twist.
There's nothing to figure out.

49
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,863
So Dad's retiring.
He's had quite a run, if you ask me.

50
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,698
The world can't be without a God.

51
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:19,699
You're right.

52
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,160
Somebody will replace him.

53
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,704
And by somebody, I mean you.

54
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,458
- Me?
- Don't play coy, brother.

55
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:32,003
You've been training for this
since you were in angel nappies.

56
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:35,298
God's right hand, the greatest warrior,

57
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,758
his bloody favorite son.

58
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,676
Well, you're not wrong there.

59
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,721
You have wanted this your whole life.

60
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:42,889
I've never said that.

61
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,308
You don't need to say it, brother.

62
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,685
Words are just words.

63
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,438
I know how you feel.[scoffs]

64
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,360
Honey-lemon whiskey sour? [chuckles]

65
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:59,405
I took a mixology course the other day.
Variety is the spice of life, you know.

66
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,115
Lucifer.

67
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,371
Being God isn't simple.

68
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,497
It's...

69
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,625
It's a big job.

70
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,502
The biggest.

71
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,588
How would I even
go about making that decision?

72
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:19,926
Well, in situations like these
when much is at stake,

73
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:23,471
I like to ask myself,
"What's your knee-jerk reaction?"

74
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,848
"You obviously want this,
so leap before you look."

75
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,018
Maybe that's how you used to act,
but, dear brother, you've changed.

76
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,813
Don't pretend otherwise. It's the therapy.

77
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:35,441
Linda has really
helped you to be more mindful,

78
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,819
to really think things through.

79
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,155
How dare you!

80
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:42,991
But maybe you're right.

81
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,159
Therapy has ruined me!

82
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:49,914
I've been overthinking all of my decisions
when really, the answer is at our feet!

83
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,374
"Just do it." [chuckles]

84
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:55,295
Well, not my feet. I'm clearly
a Louboutin man, but you know what I mean.

85
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,839
Thank you, brother. [laughs]

86
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,223
- [sniffles] Okay.
- [horn blows]

87
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,059
[chuckles] Sorry.
It's just, my French horn.

88
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,853
I'm just on my way to chuck it out.

89
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,022
What are you doing here?

90
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:17,317
I need to talk about us. I...

91
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:21,029
I know that I said I could wait
until you figured things out,

92
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:24,490
but now I realize
that I might not be able to.

93
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:29,579
This whole relationship limbo,
it's really hard, you know?

94
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:33,333
And it's now affecting other people,
like Trixie, for one.

95
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,585
And, you know, you are immortal,

96
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:41,090
so that means that I could be waiting
for a very long time. Like, forever.

97
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,676
But my point is, is that I can't wait,

98
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,014
and it's not because
you didn't say, you know, those words,

99
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,600
'cause, look, words are just words.

100
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,228
And I think I know how you feel,

101
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:55,938
but I...

102
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,316
Right now, I just... I need to know. I...

103
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:03,321
One way or another,
I need to know if we're together.

104
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,364
That's it.

105
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:09,659
Yes.

106
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,289
- Yes?
- Yes.

107
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,376
- Let's just do it.
<i>- </i>What?

108
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,962
It's obvious we want to be together,
so let's just stop overthinking it

109
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:23,383
and just be together! [chuckles]

110
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,426
- Okay.
- [chuckles]

111
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,720
- Let's do it.
- Mmm-mmm.

You know what? No.

I am not even gonna ask this time.

123
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:55,790
Because you two are
the couple who cried "relationship,"

124

Okay, fine. I have to know.

Are you together or not?

- We are.
- Definitely together.

[sighs] Well, it's about damn time.

00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:16,310
Hey, guys, you're gonna
wanna brace yourselves for this one.

130
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,062
[Chloe] Brace ourselves? Why?

131
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,689
This seems pretty straightforward.

132
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:23,568
Yeah. Vic is Arthur Sterling,
the homeowner, gunshot would to the chest.

133
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:27,029
Safe was broken into, empty,
seems like a simple robbery gone wrong.

134
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,032
Yeah, and the murder weapon is
a pearl-handled .38 stolen from the safe.

135
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,034
It's not the murder. It's the murderer.

136
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:36,080
It says we already have a full confession
from a perp who was on the scene.

Daniel, are you overthinking this?
Careful, it could ruin your life.

138
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,586
Just follow me.

139
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,046
- Okay.
- [Ella] Hmm?

140
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,883
Aww.

141
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,654
Doctor.

142
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,823
I did it.

143
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,283
I killed him.

144
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,661
Daniel, you could have warned us.

145
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,706
Linda, you killed that man?

146

I said I did, didn't I?

147
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,584
Okay. Why?

148
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,339
I think the more important question is,
why is it so hard to take me at my word?

149
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,882
Trust issues usually stem

150
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,676
from a problematic relationship
with a parental figure.

151
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,303
Mother, perhaps?

152
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:36,140
Oh, Detective, don't be fooled
by her sneaky therapist ways.

153
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,268
She's trying to trick you
into overanalyzing your emotions.

154
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,938
And before you know it, you'll be
second-guessing every decision.

155
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,439
I say we just do it.

174
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,084
Doesn't matter.

175
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,961
Impulse crime.

176
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:49,130
It was a crime of impulse.

177
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:52,633
My kind of crime. All the best decisions
are made in the heat of the moment.

178
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,720
- [chuckles] Hypothetically, of course.
- And how did you kill them?

179
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,598
Really good.

180
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,181
And hard.

181
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,893
All the way dead.

182
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,395
- She's lying.
- We know.

183
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,106
The gun registered to her is a 9mm,

184
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,317
ballistics says
the murder weapon is a .38.

185
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,444
Not to mention, it's the doctor.

186
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,863
We just don't know why she's lying.

187
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,281
I don't either.

188
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,908
I was talking to her last night and...

189
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,871
- Linda.
- Zip it, Maze.

190
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:22,954
If you don't tell...

191
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:23,914
Nope.

192
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,374
- Linda.
- Unh-unh. Nope.

193
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,835
If you don't tell them, I will.

194
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,964
Well, quite the secret
you've been keeping from us.

195
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,051
A biological daughter
who doesn't know you exist?

196
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,177
Adriana.

197
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,262
And you've been stalking her.

198
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,346
More like...

199
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,391
keeping an eye on her. From a distance.

200
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,101
- Secretly.
- Of course, secretly.

201
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,605
A little harmless stalking
never killed anyone.

202
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,858
Okay, um...

203
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,654
After Maze tracked her down, I...

204
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:58,366
I told myself to be patient.

205
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:04,705
Wait for her to find <i>me.</i>
But I couldn't help it.

206
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,041
I had to see her.

207
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,459
So you just did it.

208
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,169
One can definitely understand that.

209
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,921
[Linda] Yes, and good thing I did.

210
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,091
Even from a distance I could
tell she was mixed up in something bad.

211
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,008
Dangerous, even.

212
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,593
Is that why you bought the gun?

213
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,096
No, I bought that
after I was fried by a Goddess

214
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,555
and demons took my baby.

215
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,225
But it is why
I started carrying it with me.

216
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:29,313
Okay, Linda, you need to tell us
what <i>actually happened</i> last night.

217
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,524
Okay.

218
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:35,861
So I was tailing Adriana's car...

219
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:39,949
when suddenly she started
driving like a crazy person.

220
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,076
I knew something was wrong.

221
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,079
So when she went inside the house...

222
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,457
I followed her in,
and that's when I saw the body.

223
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,084
Did you see anyone else?

224
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:57,216
Okay, Linda, um,
I hate to say it, but it looks like...

225
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,636
Yeah, I know what it looks like.
That's why I turned myself in.

226
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,889
I know Adriana didn't do this.
She couldn't have.

227
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,433
- Why not?
- Because...

228
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,144
Because.

229
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:13,232
So I'm buying her time to get away
while the cops find the actual killer.

230
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,568
- Sounds like somebody's in denial.
- [Chloe] Hmm.

231
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,696
But if that's what your gut's telling you,
I'm right with you, Doctor.

232
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,614
Anyhow, we're gonna have to bring her in.

233
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,992
Well, then I hope by now
she's far away from here.

234
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,452
She's here.

235
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,505
She doesn't know about me,
and she can't find out. Not like this.

236
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,257
How would she even know who you are?

237
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,926
I met her once, at an open house.

238
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,429
It's a long story,
just promise me you won't tell her.

239
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,097
[Lucifer] Oh.

240
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,767
I did it. I killed him.

241
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,518
Why?

242
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,480
I'm a realtor.

243
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,732
I just sold Mr. Sterling that house.

244
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,193
I knew he was going to be out of town.

245
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,987
And I knew the combination to his safe.

246
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,782
God, it was just
supposed to be a simple robbery.

247
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,659
Nobody was supposed to get hurt.
[shudders]

248
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,872
But Mr. Sterling came home
before he was supposed to and...

249
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,290
and he caught me red-handed.

250
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,417
So I shot him.

251
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:17,546
Do you have the murder weapon
or any of the stolen items?

252
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,633
No. I got rid of everything right away.

253
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,886
I wasn't going to confess.

254
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,763
But the guilt was too much.

255
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,641
That's all I have to say.

256
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,433
[sighs]

257
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,480
Okay, well,
we're gonna need a written statement.

258
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:46,075
She didn't do it.
I don't know why she's saying this.

259
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,868
Something feels wrong.

260
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:52,498
Hmm, speaking of things that feel wrong,
but the exact opposite,

261
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:56,544
the detective and I are together,
and everything feels right.

262
00:13:56,627 --> 00:14:00,297
Neither of us holding anything back,
no unidentified feelings of unease.

263
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,718
- What?
- Well... any thoughts?

264
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,429
You know, on how splendid that is?

265
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,682
[door opens]

266
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,602
- You know she's lying, right?
- I don't know anything yet.

267
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,039
You said yourself she was
the only one you saw at the house,

268
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,231
and we have no other leads.

269
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,149
The scary guy.

270
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,317
Scary guy?

271
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,361
He's the reason
I thought Adriana was mixed up

272
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,238
in something dangerous in the first place.

273
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,532
The other day, I saw her arguing

274
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:31,203
with this big, intense, scary guy.

275
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,496
Well, there you have it.

276
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,583
First name Scary, last name Guy.
Let's go pick him up, Detective.

277
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:39,670
I memorized his license plate, in case
something bad happened. And it has.

278
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:44,508
Okay, we can put a BOLO out, but until
then, Adriana's gonna have to stay here.

279
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,177
Once we find him, you'll see. Scary guy.

280
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,429
Definitely the killer.

281
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,890
Definitely. Definitely. Definitely.

282
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:51,973
Mm-hmm.

283
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,519
[rock music playing]

284
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,290
All right.

285
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,000
Let's see what you got, Clive.

286
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,281
- [gunshot]
- [grunts]

287
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,367
[coughs]

288
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,327
A beanbag round?

289
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,289
You're not Clive.

290
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,543
[electricity crackles]

291
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,422
[both grunting]

292
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,697
[panting]

293
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,994
[woman grunts]

294
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,913
[panting]

295
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:39,707
Eve.

296
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,457
Maze.

297
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,837
[exhales] Funny seeing you here.

298
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,467
[sighs]

299
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,595
Well, that's what you get
for bringing a beanbag to a demon fight.

300
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,556
- [groans]
- The hell were you thinking?

301
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,932
[chuckles]

302
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,394
That I'd impress you with my ninja moves.

303
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,477
[laughs]

304
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,106
I didn't, did I?

305
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,525
- What are you doing here, Eve?
- [exhales]

306
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,278
Okay, um... [inhales sharply]

307
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,990
[exhales] You know
how I left to go find myself?

308
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:14,825
Yeah.

309
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:18,120
Well, I, uh... [inhales sharply]

310
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:23,542
tried a bunch of stuff,
and nothing quite clicked,

311
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:28,297
so I thought back to when I was happiest.

312
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,721
Do you remember that time we went
after that guy on that case together?

313
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:36,804
Vaguely.

314
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:42,478
Okay, I guess for you it was
just another day at the office, but...

315
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,398
[exclaims]...for me, it was...

316
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,819
different,

317
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,363
and challenging,

318
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:54,947
and...

319
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,784
[sighs]...scary.

320
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,870
In a good way.

321
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:04,583
Anyway,

322
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:09,922
I realized what I had
to do to be happy, you know.

323
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:13,592
It was really quite clear. I don't know
why it took me so long to realize it,

324
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,176
but, um...

325
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,014
I had to become a bounty hunter.

326
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,810
Okay.

327
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,394
Good luck with that.

328
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,817
Wait! Aren't you
going after that Clive guy too?

329
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,985
We could go after him together.

330
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,445
I work alone.

331
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,405
Please! [sighs]

332
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,616
- I could learn so much from you.
- Oh, good.

333
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:41,411
- You caught me on my mentoring streak.
- Uh...

334
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,789
Seventy-thirty split!

335
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,501
Eighty-twenty?

336
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,047
[sighs]

337
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,178
- Deal.
- [shouts]

338
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,973
Yay! [clears throat]

339
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,559
So I already
checked the place, you know,

340
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:07,229
no real clues as to where he could be,
but, um, check this out.

341
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,647
[chuckles]

342
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,026
It's a Hollingshead.

343
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,197
His paintings go
for hundreds of thousands.

344
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,281
[Mazikeen] Huh.

345
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:27,207
What's an expensive piece of art
doing in a crappy house in Van Nuys?

346
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,711
[clicks tongue]
Exactly what I'm wondering, Teach.

347
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,255
Don't call me that.

348
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,089
Right.

349
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,512
[man] Excuse me, where's Adriana?

350
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,931
Who can I talk to about her?
Adriana Nassar.

351
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,684
- Somebody has to know something!
- Excuse me, hi.

352
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,312
I'm the detective on the case.
Can I help you? Thank you.

353
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,271
[man] Oh, God, yes.

354
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,107
I'm Adriana's boyfriend. Owen.

355
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,609
She didn't do it, Detective.

356
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,986
Really? Yes,
I've been hearing that a lot lately.

357
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,613
What? You gonna confess too?

358
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,948
- What?
- Never mind.

359
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,660
Uh, do you have
any actual proof that she's innocent?

360
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,371
No. I don't.

361
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,457
But I think I know who might have done it.

362
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,542
Really? Go ahead.

363
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,460
Okay.

364
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,921
Adriana was having money trouble.

365
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:14,880
Did she tell you?

366
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,799
Uh, no.
She didn't tell us anything, actually.

367
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,510
[sighs] I think she's afraid.

368
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,888
She took a bad loan.

369
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,057
She got mixed up with some sketchy people.

370
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,185
I overheard her fighting
on the phone with one of them earlier.

371
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,979
Do you know,
was it a guy named Clive Winter?

372
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,856
No, no, it was a woman.

373
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:34,732
Jamie.

374
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,526
Jamie.

375
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,242
Okay, well,
that gives me enough to work with.

376
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,160
Thank you so much, gentlemen.

377
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,204
- Oh.
- [Amenadiel] Drinks on the house.

378
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,455
Oh, <i>l'chaim.</i>

379
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:49,831
Table seven, on me.

380
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,084
So what was that all about?

381
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,795
[Amenadiel] Ah, just, uh...

382
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,673
just doing some research.

383
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,092
On what? Unflattering headgear?

384
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:03,178
You don't wanna know, trust me.
It's a lot to take in.

385
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,097
Bro, I've had my mind blown,

386
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,809
figuratively and literally,
so pretty sure I can handle it.

387
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,561
- I think I'm gonna become God.
- [splutters] I'm sor...

388
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,105
What?

389
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,648
Well, my father...

390
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,735
he's retiring, and it appears
that I'm the obvious successor.

391
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:22,114
So that was a little celestial homework.

392
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,615
A focus group, if you will.

393
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,868
Asking people
what they would like to see in a god.

394
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,495
But enough about me, Dan.

395
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,247
How are you doing, buddy?

396
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:33,208
Have you recovered
from Lucifer's prank yet?

397
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,085
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

398
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:38,547
I'm having a little trouble focusing on...

399
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,630
I'm sorry.

400
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,134
Freaking God?

401
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:46,221
You're suddenly gonna
become the father of, like...

402
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,056
the whole world?

403
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,435
It's a little intimidating, honestly.

404
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,936
Sure, I'm sure, bro.

405
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,648
Talk about a promotion.
I couldn't even handle lieutenant.

406
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,900
I'm more of a "boots on the ground" type.

407
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,028
I like the nitty-gritty, day-to-day stuff.

408
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,613
But you're a big picture guy.
You're perfect for this.

409
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,907
The sky's the limit, except not.

410
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,493
[exhales]

411
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,163
Hey, congratulations, man.
I'm happy for you.

412
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,830
Thanks.

413
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,710
[rock music playing]

414
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:24,509
All right, so, the painting
Maze saw at Clive's house

415
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,136
traces back to this gallery.

416
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:29,264
- The owner's name is...
- Jamie. Is it Jamie? Say it's Jamie.

417
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,099
Right, and we're in a tizzy, why?

418
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,661
That's who the boyfriend said
Adriana fought with on the phone.

419
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,521
And she's connected with the guy
I saw threatening my daughter?

420
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,899
Shady. Shady. Let's get her to 'fess up.

421
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:39,982
Linda.

422
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,904
You said I could ride along because my
knowledge of the case could come in handy.

423
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,382
To be fair, you did say
you'd tail us if we didn't bring you.

424
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:47,324
[sighs]

425
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:50,702
I do think your privileged intel
is valuable to the case,

426
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,163
but you can't be there
when we interview a suspect.

427
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,498
Okay, fine.

428
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,249
I'll stay right here, then.

429
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:03,715
Oh. Why don't you
stay here with Linda?

430
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:04,674
Keep her company.

431
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,677
Of course.
Whatever you need, honey. [chuckles]

432
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:13,933
[exhales]

433
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:18,647
Did you notice the words of endearment
between the detective and me?

434
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,774
As I mentioned previously, we're together.

435
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,734
Uh-huh.

436
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:23,819
"Together" together.

437
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:28,240
Completely committed, no more
will-they-won't-they shenanigans. So...

438
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,286
[sighs]

439
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,083
And since you insist on asking,
it's going swimmingly.

440
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,127
I know what you're doing,
and it's not gonna work.

441
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,503
What am I doing?

442
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,672
Trying to get me to ask
about your relationship

443
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,550
so we can discuss whatever
emotional reservations you're having.

444
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,968
In case you haven't noticed,

445
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,429
I'm a little preoccupied
with something else.

446
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:53,140
Emotional reservations,
why would I have any?

447
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,602
Actually, no. Don't answer that.

448
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,980
The last thing I need
is your professional opinion.

449
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:03,525
In fact, I've realized that therapy
has been a complete waste of my time.

450
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,235
- Oh, my God.
- [sighs]

451
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:07,320
[scraping]

452
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,530
Look.

453
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:14,161
Look, that's the exact same van
I saw at one of the houses Adriana sold.

454
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:19,624
Absurd. What kind of art
is transported in a flower van?

455
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,793
The stolen kind.

456
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,629
No, no, no, the detective
told us to wait for her here.

457
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,423
What happened to Mr. I-follow-my-gut?

458
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,384
Ooh! [grumbles]

459
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,469
Therapists.

460
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,846
Always using your own words against you.

461
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,015
[huffs]

462
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:36,600
Fine.

463
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:39,311
But we are following <i>my </i>impulsive lead.

464
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,394
Okay.

465
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:49,529
Jamie Evington?

466
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:51,948
Are you the owner?

467
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,159
Detective Decker.
Can I ask you a few questions?

468
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,494
What about?

469
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,579
Do you know Adriana Nassar?

470
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,122
I don't.

471
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:02,375
Well, didn't she sell your Malibu home?

472
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,169
Oh. [chuckles]

473
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,629
<i>That</i> Adriana.

474
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,506
I barely interacted with her.

475
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,217
And what about Clive Winter?
Does that name ring a bell?

476
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,010
No. Sorry.

477
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,397
That's weird, 'cause he has a painting
from your gallery in his house.

478
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,474
A lot of people have Hollingsheads.

479
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,437
I didn't say it was a Hollingshead.

480
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,237
It's most of my business.

481
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,197
I just assumed.

482
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,535
Now, if you will excuse me,
I have clients to tend to.

483
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,291
- [Lucifer sighs]
- [huffs]

484
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,418
Really, darling, I can pick anything?

485
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,713
Oh, absolutely, darling. Van <i>Gogh</i> ahead.

486
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:49,923
[Linda chuckles]

487
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:55,303
- [gasping]
- [Lucifer] Oh! Oh!

488
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,974
Yes! That would look exquisite
next to your vanity, sweetie.

489
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,476
Oh, the colors are so...

490
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,687
colorful. [chuckles]

491
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,770
[Jamie] Good eye.

492
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,733
The artist chose a vibrant palette

493
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:12,195
to express the complexity
of the couple's emotion.

494
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,198
Or maybe it's not complex at all.

495
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,742
I bet there's nothing
but bliss between these two.

496
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,745
No matter how much my dear Linda
insists on over-analyzing.

497
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:23,665
The only thing I'm getting is that
she's worried about her daughter,

498
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:27,210
and that he keeps making
<i>everything</i> about himself.

499
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,588
What a bold and...

500
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,881
oddly specific interpretation.

501
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,592
[Lucifer hesitates]

502
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,095
- That is what I love about art.
- [Linda gasps]

503
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,305
It is so subjective.

504
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,390
- Isn't it? [chuckles]
- Yeah.

505
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:43,393
- I will give you a few to ponder over it.
- [chuckles]

506
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,022
What are we doing?

507
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,441
Clearly Jamie is running
an art theft operation.

508
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,985
- Doesn't mean she killed Sterling.
- She didn't.

509
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:52,902
Clive did.

510
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:56,281
He's her muscle.
Don't you see? I mean... [exhales]

511
00:26:56,364 --> 00:27:00,368
He and Jamie must have strong-armed
Adriana into their crime scheme,

512
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:04,289
using her to gain access
into high-end houses with valuable art.

513
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:06,916
Perhaps, but without any proof,
we don't have any leverage,

514
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,003
so let's just leave it
to the professionals, shall we? [chuckles]

515
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,212
[Jamie] So?

516
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:16,885
Is the lovely couple
interested in the lovely couple?

517
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,971
- [both laugh]
- Well, actually, uh...

518
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,267
we were wondering if you had
something a tad more exclusive?

519
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:28,063
We understand you have a talent
for acquiring art that is...

520
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,564
[softly]...otherwise engaged.

521
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:33,735
Hmm. I see. And, uh, what is it
that you are in the market for?

522
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:34,818
- Matisse.
- Monet.

523
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,696
Well, either is fine.

524
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,991
We collect impressionists
that start with the letter "M," don't we?

525
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:44,412
As long as they're unattainable,
elusive, prohibitive, beyond reach.

526
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,498
I usually only work with direct referrals.

527
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:50,627
Well, I can assure you
we are very reliable clients.

528
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:54,130
I always like to put
my Monet where my mouth is. [chuckles]

529
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,800
Actually, you know what?
I think we'll take the happy couple too.

530
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:57,759
Yeah.

531
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,094
Okay, then.

532
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:05,392
Victor at the front desk will take care
of the details for this one, and...

533
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,227
I'll be in touch about the impressionists.

534
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,310
Lovely.

535
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,314
[sighs]

536
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,411
For you, Detective.
Call it an impulse buy.

537
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:27,414
Thank you.
Never got a present from a sting before.

538
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,748
You're very welcome.

539
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,291
Sting? How was that a sting?

540
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,002
We got diddly squat.
Why aren't you mad that we went rogue?

541
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,921
- Because we didn't.
- [Linda] Huh?

542
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:38,383
Lucifer secretly called me when you went
into the gallery. I heard the whole thing.

543
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,719
The detective listened in
whilst we charmed Jamie.

544
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:43,430
Well, I charmed. You babbled mostly.

545
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:46,766
Okay, then you know about
the fake floral van and the stolen canvas?

546
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,894
Mm-hmm. I had a feeling your knowledge
of the case would come in handy.

547
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,104
Okay, then you agree.

548
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:54,107
Clive's the killer,
and my daughter is innocent.

549
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,568
Yes, except why would Adriana
take the fall for Clive

550
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,236
if she wasn't involved somehow?

551
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,780
Because Ice Queen Jamie
must have been threatening her.

552
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,949
Didn't you see how intimidating she is?

553
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,034
Bet she could crack a nut with a Kegel.

554
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,746
That's why I needed Lucifer to crack <i>her.</i>

555
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,749
Doctor, what did I tell you
about leaving it to the pros?

556
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,001
The plan is already in motion.
Right, Detective?

557
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,420
Yes, I called in a phone tap warrant
after you baited her.

558
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,797
Now all we need to do
is wait for Jamie to call Clive,

559
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,591
task him with the search of our Monet.

560
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:22,343
Uh-huh. Ping his cell,
bring him in, now with leverage.

561
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:25,180
- If Adriana won't tell us what's going on...
- Maybe Clive will.

562
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,264
[both chuckle]

563
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,934
See, Doctor? Perfect match.

564
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,269
[both chuckle]

565
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,692
Ahh, Charlie.

566
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,778
[sniffs, groans]

567
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,865
[chuckles] Hey.

568
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,909
Hey.

569
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,160
Everything go okay?

570
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,537
Oh, yeah. Totes.

571
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,456
It was so much fun.

572
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:55,210
And you know
I absolutely adore Charlie,

573
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:59,839
but, uh, I will say, I don't know
how you guys do this all day,

574
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,008
every day, like, every day.

575
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,260
Yeah. It gets easier with practice.

576
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,429
And, you know, I...

577
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,892
- I actually really enjoy the nitty-gritty.
- Hmm.

578
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:14,437
The day-to-day, the magical stuff. It...

579
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,525
I don't know, it happens
in the small moments, you know?

580
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:24,447
Well, that was cheesy.
I'm sorry, I, uh... [chuckles]

581
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,492
No, you know what? I... I totally get it.

582
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,119
God is in the details.

583
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,371
[chuckles]

584
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,250
Speaking of God...

585
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,420
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

586
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:45,260
Is there anything that
you would change about him, you know,

587
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:46,803
if you could?

588
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:49,472
- Change? About God?
- Hmm.

589
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,601
No. I mean,
that's the whole point of faith.

590
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:54,686
Acceptance.

591
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,604
Right, but...

592
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,108
just for argument's sake.

593
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:06,531
Imagine if God was standing
right here in front of you, asking you...

594
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,493
"How can I do a better job?"

595
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,704
There's gotta be something you would say.

596
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:14,621
No.

597
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,124
No. I mean...

598
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,002
God is always there for me.

599
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,379
Always. [chuckles]

600
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,505
He loves me.

601
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:27,677
Probably more than anyone should, really.

602
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,179
What does <i>that </i>mean?

603
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,681
I have...

604
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,185
I have a lot of darkness.

605
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,274
And the big guy knows and...

606
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:43,735
he doesn't care.

607
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,404
He's all good.

608
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:49,032
Which is why I don't deserve him.

609
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,870
I disagree, Ella.

610
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:56,706
I do.

611
00:31:56,789 --> 00:32:01,628
You see, I think if God was standing
right here, right now, in front of you,

612
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:05,131
that he would tell you to take
some of that faith that you have in him...

613
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,593
and put it in yourself.

614
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,263
That's...

615
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:20,647
Thank you for saying that, Amenadiel. I...

616
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,485
I'm gonna try.

617
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:29,072

[Eve exhales]

625
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:05,525
So, why do we think this Clive guy's here?

626
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:09,028
Well, the cops traced a call
that artsy-fartsy bitch made to him.

627
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:13,616
His cell number pinged near this shady
warehouse that I'm very familiar with.

628
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,368
- [Eve] Hmm.
- Call it an educated guess.

629

[Eve] Right. Smart.

630
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,455
Good place to store stolen art.

631
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:31,884
Tell me, why is it
you chose this place to stake it out?

632
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:35,680
Because we can see him coming
without him seeing us.

633
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,432
Wow.

634
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,685
Here you go.

635
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,230
What's this for?

636
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:45,648
Oh, it's a flash grenade.

637
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,276
We're not gonna need a flash bang.
This is a stakeout.

638
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:51,904
Smart.

639
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:55,324
Good insight. See,
this is exactly why I'm shadowing you.

640
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:58,036
- [chuckles] So much to learn.
- Okay, know what? Stop.

- What?
- This whole novice act, okay?

642
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,789
- I'm not buying it.
- What?

643
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,584
I saw you fight back there.
You know what you're doing.

644
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,503

00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:14,469
All right, look,
this whole "finding yourself" business

647
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,929
is really freakin' hard, okay?

648
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:20,475
It's not like you turn a corner
and "Whoop, there I am!"

649
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,853
I had to really think
about when I was happiest.

Yeah. Bounty hunting.

651
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,024
You covered that earlier.

652
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,317
Except I...

653
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,903
kind of left some stuff out.

[exhales]

655
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,325
Okay, after I became a bounty hunter,

656
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:41,537
I realized my happiness
had nothing to do with the job.

657
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,038
[sighs]

658
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:47,168
I was happy because I was with you.

659

I know. Duh.

660
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,341
And I had no idea how to get you back.

661
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,593
So I looked you up.

662
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:58,054
I saw you were on this Clive bounty

663
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:01,432
and came up with this wacky plan.

664
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:06,437
I engineered an encounter.
I thought maybe it would be romantic.

665
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,940
But then, when you took my mask off,

666
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:11,484
you didn't exactly jump into my arms.

667
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,821
You looked real mad.

668
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,573
Like, real mad.

669
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:22,620
So I panicked, and I, uh, lied. I'm sorry.

670
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,080
Of course I was mad.

671
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,417
You broke my heart.

672
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,501

674

I mean, that's awful. Awful.

I'm... I'm real sorry.

676
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,936
I didn't mean to hurt you.

00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,320
[gun cocks]

696
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,655
[man shouts]

697
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,074
[Eve shouting]

698
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,410
- [man] Get off of me!
- [gunshot]

699
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,207
[panting]

700
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,795
Not bad for a newbie.

701
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,923
[chuckles] Thanks, Teach.

702
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,092
Hey.

703
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,512
Oh, my God.

704
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,807
Oh, my God, Eve, you're shot.
Hey, look at me.

705
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,392
- Maze...
- You okay?

706
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:50,518
Mm-hmm.

707
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:52,353
[man groans]

708
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:54,689
[gasps]

709
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:57,984
[loud bang]

710
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,777
[high-pitched ringing tone]

711
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,654
[muffled grunting]

712
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,620
[Mazikeen shouts]

713
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:18,337
- [muffled dialogue]
- [Eve groaning]

714
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:21,340
Hey, stay with me, Eve.

715
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:24,510
Eve. Eve! Eve!

716
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,762
[sobs] Come on, stay with me!

717
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,564
- Hang on. I got you.
- [Eve groans]

718
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:54,290
[loud chattering]

719
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,217
[door opens]

720
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,301
Is Eve okay?

721
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,847
Um, I hope so.

722
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,266
She's in surgery at the moment.

723
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,393
Told you Clive was a scary guy.

724
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:17,855
And Jamie's muscle in the burglary scheme.
Right on both counts.

725
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:20,107
Maybe I should become a police consultant.

726
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,275
[chuckles]

727
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,736
So are they letting Adriana go now?

728
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:27,698
Well, it seems that
you were right about something else.

729
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,076
Adriana <i>was</i> part of the scheme.

730
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,953
She was the one
who told Jamie and Clive

731
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,414
about the houses
that were ripe for the robbing.

732
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:39,585
Yeah, because they were forcing her to,
like I said. So who's our new suspect?

733
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:43,421
There is...

734
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,300
There is a new suspect, right?

735
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:51,722
Maze found the murder weapon
at the warehouse with the stolen items.

736
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,725
It had Adriana's prints on it.

737
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,440
Come on, no.

738
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:03,608
No, it can't be.

739
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,320
Why not? And please don't say "because."

740
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,530
Because!

741
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,326
Because if it is, I'm to blame.

742
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,545
It's my fault she's broken.

743
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,257
[sighs]

744
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,053
[hesitates] Anyway.
Enough with the bad news.

745
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,097
On to what really matters.

746
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,516
The detective and I just had...

747
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,144
A spat! A spat, I know! I saw.

748
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:43,983
I know, and now you want <i>me</i>
to weigh in on <i>your</i> relationship.

749
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,610
That's all this has been
from the start, isn't it?

750
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:50,739
You never really cared about helping me.

751
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,701
You just needed a ride-along therapist.

752
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:57,496
For once, I needed you to care
about someone other than yourself,

753
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,582
to care about <i>me!</i>

754
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,293
You know what? Lucifer, you're right.

755
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,087
Therapy has failed.

756
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,425
I've failed.

757
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:15,639
You're just as selfish
and self-absorbed as you...

758
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,935
What is she doing here?

759
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,647
Like I was saying...

760
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,860
the detective and I just had a chat,

761
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:30,070
and we decided to talk to Adriana again.

762
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,823
But all the evidence points to her.
You think she's guilty.

763
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,700
But <i>you</i> don't.

764
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:42,041
My self-centeredness aside,
I <i>am</i> trying to help. We all are.

765
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,293
And we're not giving up.

766
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:46,544
So...

767
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,132
shall we see
what your daughter has to say?

768
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:52,967
[Adriana] <i>Nothing.</i>

769
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:56,931
I have nothing to say.
I wrote down everything I know.

770
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:01,519
Well, we looked at your statement
and did some legwork.

771
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:05,022
There are some pieces missing
that we would like you to fill in.

772
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:09,193
Just close the investigation already.
I did it. That's all I'm gonna say.

773
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:12,655
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Tell me, Adriana.

774
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,533
What is it you desire?

775
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,161
I want...

776
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:23,457
to protect my mother.

777
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,631
[Adriana] My mother's sick.

778
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:33,551
She has been for a while.

779
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,177
The treatment is expensive.

780
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:38,681
Is that why you're having money troubles?
Owen told us that.

781
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:41,767
Yeah. I mortgaged my condo,
depleted my savings.

782
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,686
I had nothing left.

783
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:46,105
Then you met Miss Thomas Crown Affair.

784
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:49,984
- Jamie approached you, didn't she?
- [Adriana] She said I'd make fast cash.

785
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,986
She promised no one would get hurt.

786
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,321
She convinced you
to give up your clients' alarm codes,

787
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,949
where the valuables were,
and when they wouldn't be home?

788
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:58,492
And Clive did the dirty work?

789
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,996
I tried to back out.

790
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,539
- I did.
- But they threatened you?

791
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,249
They said they'd kill my mom.

792
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,835
[inhales] I felt trapped.

793
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,255
I was looking for a way out

794
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:15,676
when I suddenly heard about a last-minute
change in Mr. Sterling's travel plans.

795
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,304
He was coming home early,

796
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:22,433
on the night that Clive was
supposed to rob his place.

797
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:24,059
I panicked.

798
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,812
You tried to warn Clive?
Is that why you texted him?

799
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:30,608
Texted him? No, I called him,
and he wasn't picking up,

800
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,693
so I rushed over to the house and...

801
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,112
it was too late.

802
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:42,411
Clive must have been surprised
by Mr. Sterling and killed him.

803
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:45,748
Except Clive wasn't stripping down
Mr. Sterling's house.

804
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:48,000
He was at some strip club on The Strip.

805
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:50,002
[Chloe]
Records show he was in Vegas that night.

806
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:52,046
According to him,
you called the sting off early.

807
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,631
He said you texted him Friday night.

808
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:54,715
Friday?

809
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:58,636
No, I didn't even hear about
Mr. Sterling's change of plans

810
00:43:58,719 --> 00:43:59,928
until Saturday.

811
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,473
- Right before I rushed over to the house.
- [Lucifer sighs]

812
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,893
I was at the movies on Friday night.

813
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,102
I didn't...

814
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,772
Please, you have to believe me.

815
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,690
All I want is to protect my mom.

816
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:14,276
All of this, I did for her.

817
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:18,322
Got it. Thanks.

818
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:22,368
Hey! So Adriana's mom's safe.
Did you find Linda?

819
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:25,704
No, it appears she's left.
Probably got too emotional for her.

820
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:26,789
Yeah. Oh, hi.

821
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:29,583
Control Freak Lopez for the win!

822
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:33,128
So, I myself didn't personally process
the murder weapon the first time around,

823
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,422
so I said, "Know what?
I should take another look,"

824
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,383
and winner, winner, chicken dinner!

825
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,677
The gun was wiped down, you guys.

826
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,513
And there was just
one Adriana fingerprint on it.

827
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:43,430
That's fishy.

828
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:47,810
And for the double whammy,
I also found methyl acrylate on the gun.

829
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,688
A drug I've never heard of or done.
Now that's fishy.

830
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,064
Oh, no. It's not a drug.

831
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:55,025
It's a substance found
on the sticky side of Scotch tape.

832
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,861
Someone used the tape
to transfer the print to the gun.

833
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,780
So Adriana was framed.

834
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,323
By Clive?

835
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,742
I don't think so,
I checked the phone records.

836
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:04,660
He's not lying.

837
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:07,621
Clive did receive a text
from Adriana calling off the job.

838
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,707
- Doesn't mean Adriana sent it.
- [Chloe] Right.

839
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,710
Who else had access to her phone
when she was in the movies?

840
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,253
If only the doctor were still here.

841
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:16,880
She'd probably know,
with all her stalking and whatnot.

842
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:17,964
[sighs]

843
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,300
I think I know who did this.

844
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,845
And that's a bad thing?

845
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:25,139
Only if Linda figured it out too.

846
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,599
- [Lucifer mutters]
- Okay.

847
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,441
[Linda] Owen.

848
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,653
You need to turn yourself in.

849
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:44,158
I got no idea who you are
and no idea what you're talking about.

850
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:47,244
I'm someone
who actually cares about Adriana,

851
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:51,039
not someone who pretends to care
while framing her for murder.

852
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:54,168
- Wait, what?
- I saw you step out of the theater.

853
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,754
I thought, "Aww, so polite,

854
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,214
he doesn't wanna text during the movie."

855
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:00,716
Well, polite my ass.

856
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:04,970
You were texting Clive on Adriana's cell,
telling him the sting was off,

857
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:09,057
so you could take the spoils for yourself.
You killed Mr. Sterling.

858
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,810
Give me the gun before
somebody throws you in the loony bin.

859
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,312
No, not until you confess.

860
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,731
[chuckles]

861
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,943
You think I won't shoot, huh?

862
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:21,945
Oh, I get it.

863
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,072
I look like a good person.

864
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:25,949
Well, I'm not.

865
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,702
I've been a terrible mother.

866
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:32,998
I've done nothing
for Adriana her entire life.

867
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:39,588
This is the one thing I <i>can</i> do,
so I'm saving her from you.

868
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:40,798
One way or another.

869
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,299
[Chloe] Linda!

870
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,717
Put down the gun.

871
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,594
I can't let him get away with this.

872
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,262
He framed Adriana!

873
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,306
T-this woman is nuts.

874
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:52,768
Careful, that woman is a doctor,
and an excellent one at that.

875
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:54,686
- Linda.
- But... [scoffs]

876
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,688
Why would I frame my own girlfriend?

877
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:59,274
I was the one that told you
she was innocent, Detective.

878
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,485
You're also the one
who pointed the finger at Jamie,

879
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:02,945
which led us to the warehouse

880
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:05,364
and the murder weapon
that you planted, which was smart,

881
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:07,741
but <i>now</i> we have forensic evidence

882
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,494
that Adriana's print
was transferred to the gun.

883
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,037
You're under arrest.

884
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,413
[Owen] No.

885
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,251
You did it, Doctor.

886
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:21,088
You saved your daughter.

887
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,678
- [exhales]
- [sobs]

888
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,349
Thank you.

889
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:38,688
Hey.

890
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:42,442
You look really familiar. Do I know you?

891
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,403
No, I don't think so.

892
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:47,030
Didn't you come
to an open house a while back?

893
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:48,614
I'm a realtor.

894
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:53,370
Oh. Right. Uh, maybe.

895
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:54,454
Maybe.

896
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,917
If you're wondering what I'm doing here
at the police station, I just, um...

897
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:00,626
These are my friends.

898
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:03,171
And, uh,
they were helping me with something...

899
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:05,464
important.

900
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,216
That's nice.

901
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:09,136
They helped me too.

902
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:13,098
Could have been really bad if they hadn't.

903
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:14,181
Yeah.

904
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:16,894
I mean, that's nice.

905
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:22,024
Well, I guess I should be going.

906
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:23,524
Hey.

907
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,156
I'm glad you're okay.

908
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:32,283
Thanks.

909
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:48,300
[sighs] All right, Lucifer,
you have my undivided attention.

910
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:50,052
What is it you wanted to talk about?

911
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:53,138
The only thing
I want to talk about is you.

912
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:56,934
So. Have you told her you're her mom yet?

913
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,439
No. I'm being...

914
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:04,649
respectful.

915
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,027
Well, in the words
of a wise woman I know,

916
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,279
that sounds an awful lot
like avoidance to me.

917
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:10,697
Boundaries are important.

918
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,157
Says the stalker.

919
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,242
[both chuckle]

920
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:21,041
Why didn't you tell her, Doctor?

921
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:26,922
I do think it should be her choice.

922
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,300
But if I'm being honest, I guess...

923
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,134
I'm afraid.

924
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,849
Of rejection, I just...

925
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:42,396
Not that I have
a relationship with her now, I just...

926
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:45,357
I don't know. It doesn't make any sense.

927
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,817
It makes perfect sense.

928
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,070
You want to know her, to be with her,

929
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:54,282
it's everything you've ever wanted,
but you can't completely open yourself up

930
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:57,077
because deep down
you actually believe that you don't...

931
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,287
deserve her love.

932
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,832
Because she's so perfect,

933
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:06,712
and... you're just, well...

934
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:11,215
unworthy.

935
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,473
Awfully insightful of you, Lucifer.

936
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,893
Maybe you should become a therapist.

937
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:22,978
[chuckles]

938
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:24,146
[inhales shakily]

939
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:26,356
[shudders]

940
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,992
[groans] Oh, that was a mistake.

941
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:39,828
Well, you're looking less like death.

942
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:41,663
Ha! Thank you.

943
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:42,873
[chuckles]

944
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:47,127
You know, back there when you got shot...

945
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:49,880
I hated that.

946
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:53,467
Yeah, it wasn't great
for me either. [chuckles]

947
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,261
I never felt like that before.
It was weird.

948
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:59,973
New, and I was...

949
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,349
[Eve] Afraid?

950
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,436
Yeah. I guess.

951
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:10,650
I mean, I've felt fear before,
but that was a whole... other level.

952
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:16,364
Maze, are you saying
what I think you're saying?

953
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:29,252
I wanna be with you too, Eve.

954
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,726
[sighs]

955
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,106
[both laugh]

956
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,066
There's something I want you to have.

957
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:52,442
Okay, it's...

958
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,279
Call it a family heirloom,
if you will. I just...

959
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,281
I just got it back from Lucifer.

960
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,369
[chuckles]

961
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:07,457
I don't do fear,
so this should take care of that.

962
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,961
It has my mother's immortality in it.

963
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:13,213
So I think it will protect you.

964
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:16,508
This will make me immortal?

965
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,802
Mm-hmm. Hopefully.

966
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:22,180
- I almost lost you again.
- [sighs]

967
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:24,808
And I've never hurt like that before.

968
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,937
I guess I have grown a soul.

969
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:34,067
But if this is what a soul feels like,
I don't wanna feel it again.

970
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,652
Sweetie, I...

971
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,988
I don't wanna live forever.

972
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:41,992
Why the hell not?

973
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:47,372
Because I saw what it did to my son, Cain.

974
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:48,540
You saw it too.

975
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,126
Mortality is a gift.

976
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:53,336
It makes you appreciate life.

977
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:56,548
Just like fear made you appreciate me.

978
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:58,133
- [Mazikeen huffs]
- [sighs]

979
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,927
- No, I can't accept this.
- No, you have to.

980
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,598
You have to.

981
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:07,350
Okay? Or I can't do this.

982
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,603
- What?
- I'm trying to protect you.

983
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,605
No, you're trying to protect yourself.

984
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:14,024
I almost lost you, Eve.

985
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,984
I can't lose you again.

986
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:18,069
Don't you understand?

987
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:20,571
I love you.

988
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:24,618
Maze, I love you too, very much.

989
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:26,286
[Mazikeen gasps]

990
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,789
That's why this is so scary.

991
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:33,001
But we have to embrace that.

992
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:39,841
[Mazikeen gasps]

993
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:42,593
I can't.

994
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:44,763
[shudders]

995
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:46,389
- Yes, you can.
- I'm sorry.

996
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:50,268
- M-Maze...
- [exhales]

997
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,063
Maze.

998
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:06,451
- [cooing]
- [laughs]

999
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:09,246
- Yeah? I got you.
- [knock on door]

1000
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:13,291
[Adriana] Hi.

1001
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:15,085
Linda, right?

1002
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:16,710
Hi.

1003
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:21,007
The police weren't helping <i>you,</i> were they?

1004
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:23,802
You were helping <i>them</i> with my case.

1005
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,095
Uh...

1006
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,890
I just wanted to say thank you.

1007
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:32,894
It was no big deal.

1008
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:37,691
Would you like to come in?

1009
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:42,904
Sure.

1010
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:46,407
Okay.

1011
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:56,084
Also, there was
an anonymous donation made

1012
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:59,170
to the clinic
where my mom is being treated.

1013
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:03,800
A very generous one.

1014
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,057
Well, that's... that's wonderful news.

1015
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:17,355
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.

1016
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:19,149
You're my mom.

1017
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:22,527
Aren't you?

1018
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:24,446
How did you know?

1019
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,450
When you're adopted,

1020
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:32,329
you look at everybody
who resembles you even a little bit.

1021
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:35,999
Everybody who's in the right age range.

1022
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:37,082
And you wonder.

1023
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:42,047
So that day that I went to the open house.

1024
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:45,925
I had my suspicions.

1025
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:49,137
You and that other lady
acted so weird. [laughs]

1026
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,931
I wanted to tell you.

1027
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:55,267
But I...

1028
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,813
I didn't know if you'd want me.

1029
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:09,240
I thought I should let <i>you</i> come to <i>me.</i>

1030
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,493
Well... [inhales deeply]

1031
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:12,576
Well...

1032
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:14,828
here I am.

1033
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:17,832
[chuckles]

1034
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:20,543
Here you are.

1035
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,296
[Charlie babbling]

1036
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:27,550
You have a baby?

1037
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:28,927
I do.

1038
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,016
Would you like to meet him?

1039
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:38,852
Okay.

1040
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:41,647
Okay.

1041
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:50,198
Oh! Ooh-ooh! Okay.

1042
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:53,368
[clicks tongue]

1043
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:56,162
This is Charlie. [exhales]

1044
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,498
[both chuckle]

1045
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:03,420
Hiya. Hi, Charlie. [laughs]

1046
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:06,506
Oh, my God. Hi.

1047
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,177
Hi.

1048
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:13,638
Hi, Charlie.

1049
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:14,931
I'm your sister.

1055
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:40,415
That's the kind of God
you're gonna be, isn't it?

1056
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:42,876
- Grave and weary.
- [chuckles]

1057
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:45,836
It's just,

1058
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:50,258
I thought I would be so eager
to take Father's place, you know?

1059
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:52,510
But instead, I'm having doubts.

1060
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:55,263
I think I actually understand.

1061
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,932
You feel unworthy.

1062
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:00,185
Uh, no. That's not it.

1063
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:04,022
I definitely feel worthy.
Who else would be?

1064
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:10,278
Nah, it's just, I spent so much time
looking down on humanity.

1065
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:11,862
And now...

1067
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:16,618
Lucy, I love living amongst them.

1068
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:20,497
I've finally learned how to connect.
Built a life here.

1069
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:24,501
Made friends. A family.

1070
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:27,712
If I'm being honest,

1071
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:29,254
I...

1072
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:32,467
don't want any of that to change.

1073
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:35,303
So what, you're thinking of backing out?

1074
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:36,262
No.

1075
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:39,807
That would be selfish, Lucy.
I must embrace my celestial duty.

1076
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:43,061
- You should do what makes you happy.
- How I wish it were that simple.

1077
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:44,437
Well, maybe it can be.

1078
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:49,901
That is, if someone else
were willing to take the responsibility.

1079
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:51,361
Someone worthy.

1080
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:53,947
Who?

1081
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:56,908
Me, of course! [chuckles]

1082
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:59,410
This is exactly
what I need to prove myself.

1083
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:01,621
- What?
- You heard me, brother.

1084
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,082
I've just decided.

1085
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,127
I'm going to be God.
