1
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,117
Father. [hesitates]

2
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:36,493
You're here.

3
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,747
Well, you've got my attention.

4
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:42,167
Oh, Father, thank you for coming.

5
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,502
You... you saw how they were attacking me?

6
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:48,256
And look what Lucifer did to my face.

7
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,341
Yes, of course, oh, this is all my fault.

8
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:53,553
Go on, go ahead, Dad,
blame it all on me, like always.

9
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:56,097
No, Father, this is all my fault.

10
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:59,726
I lost control
and froze time, and as the eldest brother,

11
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,437
I should've kept a better handle
on my siblings. I'm truly sorry.

12
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,230
I don't care who's at fault.

13
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,443
- I just want my sons to get along.
- [scoffs]

14
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:13,198
Regardless of what's happened,
we're family.

15
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,034
Let's act like it.

16
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:19,162
Good point, Father. [sighs]

17
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,121
Come on.

18
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:22,873
Bring it in.

19
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,794
- Uh...
- Come on. Here.

20
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,716
You've <i>got </i>to be joking.

21
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,594
No! Hell, no!

22
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,471
Come now, Samael.

23
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,181
[shudders]

24
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:42,060
Michael impersonated me,
tried to ruin my life.

25
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,771
Kidnapped the woman that I... [huffs]

26
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:47,690
He is behind every bad thing
that's ever happened to me!

27
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,442
Well, everything apart from you.

28
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,861
And for someone
who's supposed to be omniscient,

29
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,322
it's amazing
that you never actually see that!

30
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,494
And apparently never will. [scoffs]

31
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,329
[scoffs]

32
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:05,874
[mouths] Now?

33
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:20,515
Is that my grandson over there? Huh.

34
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,476
[chuckles]

35
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,904
Well, now, this won't do at all.

36
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,034
[clamoring]

37
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,791
What just happened?

38
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,378
And who are you?

39
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,472
[sighs]

40
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,396
Hey, oh, my God, are you okay?
That must've been a crazy big earthquake.

41
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,685
Yeah.

42
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,729
Yeah, I'm fine.

43
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,191
Hey, wait. Uh... have you seen Lucifer?

44
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,693
Um, no, sorry.

45
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,453
[high-pitched ringing]

46
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,592
Where is he?

47
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,720
- [rock and roll playing on piano]
- [cheering]

48
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:45,516
- Ha-ha! Yeah!
- [shouting]

49
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,269
- [laughs]
- Whoo! [laughs]

50
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,069
Here we go!

51
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,279
Big!

52
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,458
[cheering]

53
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,128
[laughs]

54
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,421
Yeah!

55
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,674
Whoo!

56
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:19,842
Mmm!

57
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,803
[exhales]

58
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:22,720
Hi.

59
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,973
Detective! Where have you been?

60
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,433
Hey. Um, can I talk to you for a second?

61
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,393
Absolutely!

62
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,437
[dance music playing]

63
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:44,284
Hey, so,
uh, what happened back at the precinct?

64
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,706
When we were talking,
and, uh, you were about to say...

65
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,750
or at least I thought...

66
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:56,462
I knew what you were about to say,
and then I blinked, and, well,

67
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,172
suddenly, no you.

68
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,842
Detective, I'm sorry. [exhales]

69
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,594
I needed to get away.
I couldn't take it anymore.

70
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:04,971
"Take it"?

71
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:08,057
People!
Telling me what to do, especially...

72
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,141
Me?

73
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:10,809
No.

74
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,187
No, Detective, I'm sorry, I...

75
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,858
It's okay.
I... I think I pushed you too far,

76
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,152
and it wasn't fair of me to do that,

77
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,404
and I get why you ran away.

78
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,906
- But that's not why I ran.
- No, I... I understand.

79
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:25,950
I really do. Um...

80
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,204
You know, I think, uh,
maybe I'll just give you some time,

81
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,458
and, um, when-when you're ready,

82
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,626
I'll be ready to listen.

83
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,710
Okay?

84
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,558
[Charlie cooing]

85
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,853
Yep.

86
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:57,690
You're really here.

87
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,776
[sighs] I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

88
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,735
I met Eve

89
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,695
and the Goddess of all creation.

90
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:08,576
I even thought
I met you once, but still... [chuckles]

91
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,954
Yeah, I'm never
gonna get used to this. Mnh-mnh.

92
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,539
You can poke all you want.

93
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,376
Because I'm eternally grateful to you...

94
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,128
for this beautiful grandson.

95
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,340
- Yeah.
- Who's the cutest little baby?

96
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,592
Yes, it's you.

97
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,052
- That's right.
- [chuckles]

98
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,723
My angel baby
is technically God's grandkid.

99
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:33,768
Do you need a drink?

100
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,728
Water? Wine?

101
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,688
Is it all the same to you?

102
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,149
Yeah, I'm gonna get some options. Okay.

103
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,117
Father, I do have to
tell you that Lucifer was right.

104
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:53,121
Michael has made
quite a mess here on Earth.

105
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,207
And I'm afraid he's not done.
He's up to something.

106
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,334
Day-to-day isn't important, my son.

107
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,045
This is important.

108
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,799
- Family's important.
- Yes, I agree.

109
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,427
And that's, um...

110
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,347
that's what I wanted to talk to you about.

111
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,101
About Charlie and, uh...

112
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:18,771
Father, is he...

113
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:19,855
Adorable?

114
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:21,941
Yes, he is, my son.

115
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,526
God's honest truth.

116
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,987
- Yes, but, Father, I...
- You know what?

117
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,865
Being here gives me an idea.

118
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,199
Yeah?

119
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,996
I think I know
just what this family needs.

120
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,459
You know, Dan,
you really should stay home.

121
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,918
Just take some time off.

122
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,379
Learning the truth
about Lucifer, it's a lot.

123
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,463
I've been there.

124
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,800
I'm guessing you handled it better.
Or did you shoot him too?

125
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:52,805
[scoffs] I didn't, but I did almost poison
him with the help of an evil priest.

126
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,601
[laughs] I genuinely
can't tell if that's a joke or not.

127
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,519
Take some time, Dan.

128
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,855
Look, I just wanna work.

129
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:06,110
You know? Hell, you're the one who was
kidnapped. You should take some time off.

130
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,194
Touché.

131
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,740
How are you doing, by the way?

132
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,700
I noticed Lucifer's not here.

133
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:16,162
Well, we... we hit a snag,
and he's dealing with some things,

134
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,748
and I may have rushed him a bit,

135
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:22,919
so I'm giving him space,
but he'll figure it out.

136
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,046
We're strong enough to get through this.

137
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,674
Well, at least
Ella's taking some time off.

138
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,885
[scoffs] Yeah.

139
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,305
[Dan] Oh. Hey, Ella.

140
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,184
Before you start, no, I am not going home.

141
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,061
I need to focus on the case.

142
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:41,937
Okay.

143
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,649
Really?

144
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,111
I had, like,
five pretty solid arguments ready.

145
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,173
- I mean, if you wanna hear them...
- No, we're good.

146
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,490
- We're good.
- What do we have?

147
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,866
[Ella sighs]

148
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,287
Vic was Chris Peterson.

149
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,207
COD seems to be
blunt force trauma to the head.

150
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,251
I think he hit his head on the cement,

151
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:07,338
but it's kind of hard to tell,
thanks to his BBQ-ed bod.

152
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,132
[exhales] Looks like someone
was trying to burn down the hole.

153
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,009
Maybe Chris stepped in, tried to stop 'em?

154
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,928
Yeah,
we found gasoline all over this place.

155
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:16,639
Someone was trying
to burn down the entire Kingdom.

156
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:20,059
Lucky for the owners, the cement
stopped the fire from spreading, but...

157
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,852
Who was he? One of the workers?

158
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,980
No, this place is family-owned,

159
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,066
so the dad and the kids
all work here and run this place.

160
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,485
And this was the youngest son.

161
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,736
Any witnesses?

162
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,906
No. But the three kids were here,
working after hours,

163
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,660
but they say they didn't see
any struggle or hear any arguments.

164
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:41,080
They just saw the fire,
rushed out, only to find...

165
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,665
The body of their burned brother.

166
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,644
Well, let's go talk to them, see if
any of them wanted their brother dead.

167
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,379
Oh, way ahead of you.
I know exactly how to find the killer.

168
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,715
- You do?
- [Ella] Hell, yeah.

169
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:54,844
See, all you have to do
is introduce me to all of the suspects.

170
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,305
And whichever one I'm most attracted to,

171
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,724
bam, that's your killer.

172
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,100
Ella.

173
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,893
Hey, I'm at peace with it.

174
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:06,480
If I've got a broken picker, might as well
use it for the greater good, right?

175
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,748
What are you gonna say to her?
Something romantic?

176
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,001
You have that look on your face.

177
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:29,712
Well, not anymore.

178
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:31,881
What do you care?

179
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:35,343
Why even ask? You're all-knowing,
don't you already know the answer?

180
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:38,596
Hmm. Father's intuition.

181
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,057
Well, intuit yourself somewhere else.

182
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,475
Actually, no.

183
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,268
Why <i>are</i> you still here?

184
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,355
Isn't the universe gonna collapse
with your you-like powers on Earth?

185
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,357

- It's fine.
- Is it?

189
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,497
Well, as always, thanks for clearing
that up. Now, if you don't mind...

190
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,876
I've come to ask you something.

191
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:13,923
Well, go on, then.

192
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,925
I'd like you to join me.

193
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,386
For a family dinner.

194
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:21,347
[laughs] Yeah?

195
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,098
No.

196

Pass. Hard pass.

197

[God] Son.

198
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,189
I don't wanna
leave Earth until we've all talked.

199
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,317
Well, enjoy your eternity here, then,

200
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,945
because there is absolutely no way

201
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:40,658
I am sitting down for anything
as absurd or torturous as a family dinner.

202
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,993
I've already done my time in Hell.

203
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,078
Remember?

204
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,211
[exhales] Good morning.

205
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:55,131
Lucifer. I thought you needed space.

206
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:59,009
Nope, no space needed. I'm right where
I need to be. So, where's the family?

207
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,804
Well, the siblings are over there,
but how did you know...

208
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,556
One of them is obviously the killer.

209
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,602
He doesn't even know what the crime is.

210
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:13,649
No, he's probably just
projecting his latest issues.

211
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,446
- He's projecting his latest issues.
- What, and that's a good thing?

212
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,740
He thinks it's the family. I...

213
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:24,118
I thought he was upset with me
for rushing him, but he's not. He...

214
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,997
He's mad at his own family.

215
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,123
Of course.

216
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,627
I should have stayed home.

217
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:47,224
The Kingdom was built
from the ground up by our father.

218
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,853
Everyone in the family
has a role in keeping the place running,

219
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,982
but Chris, he never settled into his role.

220
00:12:55,065 --> 00:13:00,029
In... In fact, he... he left
a few years back to work for himself.

221
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,656
So, what you're saying is

222
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,701
the wayward son rebelled
against the family, forged his own path,

223
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,911
and then you killed him.

224
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,413
What? We... we would never.

225
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,500
We were all still close,
even though Chris left.

226
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,920
And look, he died protecting it. He...

227
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,214
he died a hero.

228
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,509
Do any of you know anyone
who'd wanna burn the place down?

229
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,135
Yeah, Juan Perez.

230
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,136
And who's Juan?

231
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,056
He is the owner of Hole in Juan.

232
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,517
[laughs] See what he did there?

233
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,643
Sorry. You were saying.

We've had a rivalry for years,
but lately it's gotten pretty intense.

236
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,071
We always pranked each other.
He stole our balls.

237
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:46,659
We rearranged his putt-putt statues
in suggestive positions.

238
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,369
Ah, well, if you appreciate that,

239
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,812
you'll love what I did with your squires
on the second hole.

240
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,540
And to their second holes.

241
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:55,626
Yes, but a prank war
isn't motive for murder.

242
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,253
[woman] Things escalated lately.

243
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:03,008
Last week, Juan spray-painted this
on the side of our castle.

Yes, but are you sure it was him?

00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,184
He signed it.

Chris came to you for a job?

285

Yeah, but I would never employ a Peterson.

why wouldn't he just
go back to the Kingdom?

00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:22,952
Or won't?

349
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,127
Still think I'm perfect now?

350
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,048
You... are you.

351
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,052
And I'd never change that.

352
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,556
You know what I think, hmm?

353
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,852
I think you messed up
when you made demons.

354
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,229
When you made me.

355
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,357
I think you made a mistake.

356
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,611
And you don't wanna admit it.

357
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,371
- [door opens, closes]
- [sighs]

358
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:13,629
<i>♪ So down, so deep... ♪</i>

359
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,546
Nope.

360
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,174
<i>♪ Nobody has nothing on me ♪</i>

361
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,259
What are you doing here, brother?

362
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,886
Solving a very important case.

363
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:23,096
A mini-golf murder. High-stakes stuff.

364
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,723
Father is here, Lucy.

365
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,475
On Earth.

366
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,727
You heard me say mini-golf, right?

367
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,771
Wha...?

368
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:32,814
He wants to see us.

369
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,401
Talk to us. I mean,
we can finally get some answers.

370
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,402
[chuckles]

371
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:41,907
Well, based on my conversations
with him so far, not bloody likely.

372
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,661
[sighs] You know, he's hardly said
a word to us our entire lives, brother,

373
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,454
and now he suddenly wants to catch up.

374
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:48,914
What next?

375
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:51,875
A game of rounders in the park?
A little push on the swings?

376
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,878
Would you stop playing silly buggers?

377
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,631
- I like to see it as a gesture, Lucy.
- [scoffs]

378
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:01,009
And one that I think
that we should seriously consider.

379
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,595
[sighs] Brother.

380
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:09,309
You've done so well getting out
from under dear old Dad's thumb.

381
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,019
Becoming your own man.

382
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:13,897
But one fatherly slap on the back

383
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:17,317
and you're back to being
his dutiful lackey, aren't you?

384
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,319
- Lackey?
- Mm-hmm.

385
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,821
Well, look who's talking.

386
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:23,115
Father shows up
for one minute, Lucy, one minute,

387
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,826
and you go right back
to being a spoiled child,

388
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,035
stomping off to pout!

389
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,538
I wasn't pouting! Now look what you did.

390
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,332
[exhales] Listen, Lucy, I...

391
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:39,214
I know that Dad has been
a bit careless in the past, distant.

392
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,716
[scoffs]

393
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,635
- All right, he's been a real ass.
- Hmm.

394
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,387
But he's our father, Lucy.

395
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,470
Yes.

396
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:50,809
Our almighty, all-powerful dad

397
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:54,396
who will never admit
to being anything other than perfect.

398
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,026
Well, guess what, brother. He can
kiss my imperfect, banished backside!

399
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,860
- Lucy.
- Yeah.

400
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,909
[Amenadiel sighs] Right.

401
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,038
Wow.

402
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,709
- Things are looking really clean in here.
- Oh.

403
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:18,920
Yeah, well, I'm waiting on lab results,

404
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,798
so I thought
I'd catch up on some maintenance.

405
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:22,882
[clicks tongue]

406
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:26,428
Beakers are clean,
so you know what that means.

407
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,511
What's that?

408
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,431
Pipette time!

409
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,853
I throw myself into work
when I'm dealing with something too.

410
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,271
Oh, I'm fine.

411
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:41,860
Ella, none of us saw this coming.
Pete had all of us fooled.

412
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:43,487
He had me fooled.

413
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,447
Yeah, I guess you're right.

414
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,699
I mean, after all,
you had sex with him too.

415
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,702
So it's a little different, right?

416
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:53,954
Right.

417
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:58,293
Listen, I can't pretend
to understand how you're feeling,

418
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:02,798
but I did just go through an experience
where someone I thought I knew wasn't...

419
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,634
who I thought he was.

420
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,220
Hard to beat a secret serial killer.

421
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:09,346
[chuckles] You'd think.

422
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,809
Listen, the point is...

423
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,771
so many people wear masks, Ella.

424
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:20,607
They... they hide who they really are.

425
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,690
But not you.

426
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,487
You put yourself out there, heart first.

427
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,989
The downside is you get hurt more easily.

428
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,158
[scoffs] Ain't that the truth.

429
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,993
But the upside is

430
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,246
you put so much love into the world, Ella.

431
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,416
Please don't let this change that,

432
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,334
change you.

433
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,255
We need more people
like you out there, Ella.

434
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:45,673
Not less.

435
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:49,802
[Lucifer] Oh.

436
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,931
[sighs]

437
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,935
Lucifer. Okay, so, new theory...

438
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,146
Unh-unh. Just hold that thought.

439
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,815
Here. It's slightly right edge.

440
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,358
Go on, you were saying?

441
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:07,946
Right. So wayward son Chris
attempted to burn down the Kingdom.

442
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:12,159
One of the siblings,
at least, found him mid-arson.

443
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:15,912
They must have got into a fight
about it, and Chris ended up dead.

444
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,165
[exhales] The poor lad
just wanted a fresh start,

445
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:21,042
and now he
finds himself cast down into Hell...

446
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,627
I'm... I'm assuming.

447
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,589
Anyone that fixated
on mini-golf must have issues.

448
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:26,548
- Right.
- [exhales]

449
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,926
So, say Chris was you.

450
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:30,844
[Lucifer] Hmm.

451
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:34,014
Uh, then the killer would be who?

452
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,097
Michael?

453
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:37,684
Detective, why are you
bringing my brother into this?

454
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:40,604
Well, because you're having family issues,

455
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:44,483
and rather than fight that,
I thought I would use that to help you.

456
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:48,028
You know, to help us to solve the case.

457
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,571
Very well, if you insist.

458
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,115
Great. Let's go find our Michael.

459
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,409
- Okay.
- [exhales]

460
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,288
[Chloe clears throat]

461
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:04,961
Uh, did you have
any grievances with Chris?

462
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:08,507
No. Of course not. We all loved him.

463
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,967
We were one big, happy...

464
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:14,137
- ...family.
- [scoffs] No such thing.

465
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:17,474
- We should arrest them for that lie alone.
- We heard otherwise.

466
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:18,557
You have?

467
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,644
Uh, from who?

468
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:23,855
- Hmm. [clicks tongue]
- Was it Larry? Of course it was.

469
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,483
Did Ted tell you
that I have a problem with April?

470
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:30,237
Huh? Wait! They're both liars.

471
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,740
It wasn't enough for you to manipulate
your poor, misunderstood brother,

472
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:36,535
you had to ruin his life as well?

473
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:37,869
Ruin his life?

474
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:41,081
Kill. He means kill... his life.

475
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,375
- Well, I had nothing to do with it.
- No.

476
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,459
I swear.

477
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:48,129
So all three of you claim to have
been working the night of the murder.

478
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,423
- So what were you doing?
- Maintenance.

479
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:51,633
On the arcade games.

480
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,134
Updating the books.

481
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,679
Cleaning the toilets.

482
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,598
And can your siblings corroborate that?

483
00:25:58,682 --> 00:25:59,682
Sure.

484
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,143
I mean, I don't know if Ted will.

485
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,312
He was gone a while.

486
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,023
I wasn't there the entire night.

487
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:12,571
I went out to the parking lot
to make out with my new girlfriend.

488
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,156
Ugh. Have you seen Ted?

489
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,201
- No one wants to smash that.
- [chuckles] Unless he's paying her.

490
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,578
I wasn't paying!

491
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:23,748
You should talk to April.
She disappeared for a while.

492
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,126
She was "in the bathroom."

493
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:29,879
I was smoking pot. Okay? It's the only way
I can deal with my brothers.

494
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,006
Understandable.

495
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,341
What did April do? Come in here and whine?

496
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,678
You know,
Larry was always jealous of Chris.

497
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:40,140
If either of those idiots did it,
it was him.

498
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:44,060
Jealous. Looks like we found our Michael.

499
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,646
Hmm. He seems
more like an Amenadiel to me.

500
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:52,027
[sighs] Unless he's a Michael
pretending to be an Amenadiel.

501
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:56,197
Michael never pretends to be Amenadiel.
They look nothing alike.

502
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,281
No, I mean...

503
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,327
[sighs] No, just, never mind.

504
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,371
Look, I'm sorry, Detective.
I think I need a moment.

505
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,169
Excuse us. Lucifer, I...

506
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,673
[sighs]

507
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,011
Listen, what if they're all Michaels?

508
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:20,013
Look how quickly
they turned on each other.

509
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,096
Perhaps.

510
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:22,765
[Chloe sighs]

511
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,685
What if they apologized to you?

512
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,311
To me?

513
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:28,772
I mean, to Chris.

514
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:31,733
I don't understand.
What good is apologizing to a dead body?

515
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,109
- [officer] Detective.
- Yes.

516
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,906
I'm Peter Peterson, and I, um...

517
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,867
Have the greatest name ever. [chuckles]

518
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,452
I'm the father of...

519
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:44,579
Chris Peterson, yes.

520
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,164
So sorry for your loss.

521
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:49,626
Thank you. But I'm afraid
you're after the wrong suspects.

522
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,127
Right.

523
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,754
Well, with all due respect...

524
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,839
I killed my son.

525
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,718
And I can't let
another one of my children suffer

526
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,261
because of my mistakes.

527
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:04,974
I dropped by the, uh, Kingdom last night.

528
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:08,895
I saw Chris take a gas can from the shed.

529
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:10,897
I tried to stop him, of course,

530
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,483
but we fought and...

531
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,402
I mean, it was an accident, but...

532
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:20,031
I killed my own son.

533
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,033
I see.

534
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:27,288
Well, thank you for that.
Would you please take his full statement?

535
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,166
- I'll be with you in a minute.
- All right. I'm...

537
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,548
Are you okay?

538
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:42,095
I am, Detective.

539
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:46,266
You know, hearing that
confession felt great, actually,

540
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:48,476
like exactly what I've been searching for.

541
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,397
I think I now know
exactly what I need to do.

but we shouldn't be surprised.

547
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,343
I mean, Lucifer isn't mature enough.

548
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,970

Yeah, I find that, at family events,
a couple of bottles help.

559
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,643
- [chuckles]
- To start.

560
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:15,522
Okay. I'm off.
- You're not joining us, Linda?

561
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:20,568
Well, this is a <i>family</i> dinner,

562
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,738
and, well, I'm... not.

563
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,491
You are the mother of my grandchild.

564
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,410
Of course you're family.

565
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,254

Well, this smells delicious, Father.

568
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,763
You have outdone your always-divine touch.

569
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,431
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

570
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,851
Aren't you forgetting something?

571
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,854
Well, shouldn't we say grace?

572
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,106
[scoffs]

573
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:06,865

- Okay.
- [clears throat]

00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,747
I'd like to thank God for...

[chuckles]

577
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:23,840
I'm used to you
being up there. [clears throat]

578
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:31,806
Thank you, God,
for this food and the company, and...

579
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:39,105
oceans and napkins

580
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,233
and shoes and life.

581
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,068
Yeah, that about covers it, Doctor.

582
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,112
- Thank you. Amen.
- [Linda clears throat]

583
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,822
That was beautiful, Linda.

584
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:48,906
Thank you.

585
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,034
I just thanked God for napkins.

586
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:53,328
- It was better than I would have done.
- Okay.

587
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,411
Well.

588
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,121
Let's dig in.

589
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,252
[Michael sighs]

590
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:03,755
Well, isn't this great?

591
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,799
Wonderful meal with family.

592
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,222
[chuckles]

593
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,751
Oh, my God.

594
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,671
[sighs] I mean, you.

595
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,297
- I mean...
- [God and Linda chuckle]

596
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,675
This is... this is delicious.

597
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:49,592
Almost...

598
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:50,677
Heavenly?

00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,595
- [sighs]
- [laughing]

600
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,723
All it takes is
just the right amount of rosemary.

601
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,267
You know,
I have to compliment you, Michael.

602
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,854
At first, I thought
you exploiting poor Amenadiel's fears

603
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,983
about Charlie's mortality
was just a... a real shit move.

604
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,192
[chuckles]

605
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:09,821
And impersonating me, ravaging my life,

606
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,572
convincing a friend to shoot me

607
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,534
and kidnapping my girlfriend,
downright villainous.

608
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,744
None of these sound like compliments.

609
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:20,081
I started to wonder,
maybe there was an endgame.

610
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:23,501
You create a mess
big enough to bring God himself down,

611
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,253
we all regress in Dad's presence,

612
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,296
noble Amenadiel takes the blame,

613
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,008
rebellious Lucifer
runs off in a huff, leaving you...

614
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,219
looking like the perfect son.

615
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:39,017
But now, I realize it was just
to bring the family together for dinner.

616
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,810
[chuckles]

617
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:41,894
Pass the chicken.

618
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:48,401
I know what you're trying to do, but
I'm not gonna let you ruin this, Samael.

619
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:50,653
Very well, Mi-ka-el.

620
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:53,448
- It's "Michael"!
- Is it?

621
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,366
I mean, we're twins, after all.

622
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,036
Fairly certain
Dad wanted them to rhyme. Dad?

623
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,246
I did like the sound of that.

624
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:03,875
Samael, Mi-ka-el. [chuckles]

625
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,961
- But you boys had other ideas.
- [Amenadiel] Hmm.

626
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,757
You know, I'm glad
you persuaded me to come, brother.

627
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,760
Like you said, it's worth it,
even if Dad has been a real ass.

628
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:16,262
[gulps, coughs]

629
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,599
That's, um... [chuckles]

630
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,976
That's actually not what I said.

631
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,104
I was sympathizing
with my little brother, Dad,

632
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,732
trying to, uh, get him to come to dinner.

633
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:29,734
It's okay, son.

634
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:30,818
Is it?

635
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:31,944
And was he?

636
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:35,990
[chuckles] Now think of what Amenadiel
went through the past couple of years.

637
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,534
All that anguish,
thinking he'd fallen from your favor.

638
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:41,287
He lost his wings, his very sense of self.

639
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,490
Yeah, that's a bit dramatic.

640
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:47,043
Only to discover that
he was doing it all to himself.

641
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,747
Couldn't you have just
told us that's how we all work,

642
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:52,716
instead of letting your favorite son
think he was being brutally punished,

643
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,300
that he was a failure?

644
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:57,053
- Lucy, come on.
- [chuckles] No, don't worry, brother.

645
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,304
We're all being tortured.

646
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:02,892
All in the name
of our father's mysterious ways.

647
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,352
Ooh!

648
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,270
For example, Dad...

649
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:12,860
are you ever going to tell us why Hell
suddenly doesn't need a warden anymore?

650
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:22,703
I have a good reason.

651
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,498
Oh, it's a <i>good</i> reason.

652
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,958
Well, that explains it.

653
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,252
As always, super clear. Thanks, Pops.

654
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,587
What are you even
complaining about, Lucifer?

655
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:34,841
You got your own kingdom
as a reward for bad behavior.

656
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,013
Is that how you see it?

657
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:47,895
Being forced to torture souls for hundreds
of thousands of years was an "attaboy"?

658
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:50,690
Sure, I was king of Hell,

659
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:52,483
but I was still <i>in Hell.</i>

660
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,862
If that's not a poisoned chalice,
I don't know what is.

661
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,865
You have no idea what that was like,

662
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:01,033
how easy you had it.

663
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:02,702
Easy?

664
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:03,828
[scoffs]

665
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:06,873
I spent my entire life
in the worst kind of Hell there is.

666
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:10,835
- Lucy, Michael, come on.
- Oh, what could possibly be worse?

667
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:13,129
Sharing a face with you!

668
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,718
Guess what.

669
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:21,053
When your twin is the light bringer,

670
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,973
turns out you have no choice
but to live in the shadows.

671
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:28,811
We were dealt the same hand,
the same face, the same bloody shoulders,

672
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:32,398
except you had a chip on yours
so big you managed to self-actualize it.

673
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:35,234
Oh, no, no, no, there's nothing
wrong with him, don't be fooled!

674
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:38,571
You have no one to blame
but yourself for who you are.

675
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:39,572
Lucy!

676
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,282
Oh, I blame you plenty.

677
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,577
- Michael!
- Of course you do, you petty little...

678
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:48,539
- Children!

679
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,228
[Lucifer] And there it is.

The Old Testament wrath.

681
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,568
Wasn't sure you still had it in you.

682
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:24,283
All I wanted was a nice family dinner.

683
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:29,038
But apparently that's too much to ask.

I get it.

00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,314
I get it. It's your favorite.

690

That's... that's why
everything tastes like chicken.

I'm sorry, I'm just really uncomfortable.

No, Linda, we're sorry. That you
had to witness something like this.

695
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,376
No. [sighs]

Actually, it's...

697
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:22,216
it's wonderfully normal.

698
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,053
Well, I mean, except for the rain.

699
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,181
No, it's just...

700
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:33,936
three sons who want their father's love.

701
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,274
And who don't feel
like they're getting it.

702
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:40,443
I don't want Dad's love.

703
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:45,865
I just want him to admit
to the fact that he's a bad father.

704
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,575
Although...

705
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:53,331
maybe that's part
of the reason he <i>is</i> a bad father.

706
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,583
Well done, Doctor.
You're as insightful as ever.

707
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,461
No, that wasn't exactly what
I was saying. [sighs] As usual...

708
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:01,047
- You're really being unfair.
- Oh, come on, brother.

709
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,425
Would you treat Charlie
the same way Dad's treated us?

710
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,428
- Well, I...
- Be honest! Please.

711
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,978
I'm sorry, Dad, but I hope not.

712
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:20,107
And you'd do anything
for your son, wouldn't you?

713
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:22,735
I would.

714
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:24,987
[Lucifer] Michael and I
don't agree on much,

715
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:28,908
but the one thing that we all
have in common is you, Dad.

716
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,994
And how much you've screwed us up.

717
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,166
I mean, if all the apples are bad...

718
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,961
maybe it's the tree that's the problem.

719
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,756
I'm sorry you feel that way.

720
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,803
All I ever wanted was to empower you...

721
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,555
all my children,

722
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,266
to make your own choices.

723
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,685
Is that why you've always been so cryptic?

724
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,772
Oh. Before you answer that cryptically,

725
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:04,402
I would like to instead
ask you one simple question

726
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:07,530
and get one simple answer.

727
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,990
A confession, if you will.

728
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,243
Dad, you don't have to do this.

729
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,665
What's your question, Samael?

730
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,088
Dad...

731
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,134
do you love us?

732
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,761
[thunder crashing]

733
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,814
If I have to tell you...

734
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,359
then I really have failed.

735
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,363
A no, then.

736
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:53,284
- That's not what he said.
- [Lucifer] He didn't say yes, did he?

737
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:55,536
When I don't wanna lie,
I don't answer the question.

738
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,580
Picked that up from you, Dad.

739
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,710
[scoffs, inhales deeply]

740
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,670
You know, it's... It's funny.

741
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,674
I thought this moment
would give me some catharsis.

742
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:14,388
But instead, it's just
made me realize one simple truth.

743
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,934
That you will never love us...

744
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,688
because you're incapable of love.

745
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,901
- [huffs]
- [thunder crashes]

746
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:29,695
And that's just sad.

747
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:33,448
For all of us.

748
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,327
[thunder rumbles]

749
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:49,089
[door opens, closes]

750
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:59,016
- More wine?
- [thunder crashes]

751
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,443
[sighs] Hello, ladies.

752
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,947
What exciting new case
are we investigating today?

753
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,324
Hole in Juan?

754
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,868
I don't understand. Peterson confessed.

755
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,120
Yeah, his confession doesn't add up.

756
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:23,457
Yeah, we found traces of ZX3
in the fuel that burned down the Kingdom.

757
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:27,711
Oh! So whoever burned down
the Kingdom used gas from Hole in Juan.

758
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,673
Yeah, but Peterson told us
he saw his son get gas from the shed.

759
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:34,009
So he lied. Fathers do that. [chuckles]

760
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,887
Well, we pulled surveillance footage
from the day before Chris died.

761
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,347
[Ella] There's Chris.

762
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,933
I mean, he does
look like he's applying for a job.

763
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:44,645
- It tracks with what we know.
- Yeah, but something doesn't track.

764
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:47,648
That looks like his girlfriend Betty.

765
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,692
And she told us
she didn't know anything about it.

766
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:52,069
Looks like Peterson
wasn't the only one lying.

767
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:54,738
Right. We need to bring Betty in,
see what she's hiding.

768
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,740
- We have to get Peterson back...
- Hey, guys.

769
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,450
- [Chloe] Yeah.
- Peterson's running.

770
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,494
- [Chloe] What?
- He bailed on house arrest.

771
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:04,039
His ankle bracelet pinged in downtown
traffic. He's headed to Union Station.

772
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:07,960
- If he's innocent, why is he running?
- Well, let's go and find out, shall we?

773
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:17,844
So...

774
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,808
- Charlie.
- Hmm.

775
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:26,312
He's, um...

776
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,983
He's mortal, isn't he?

777
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:33,485
It appears so.

778
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,240
So he'll suffer like all humans, Dad.

779
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,870
Get sick.

780
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:46,914
Grow old.

781
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,254
Die.

782
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,715
That would follow
from the fact that he's mortal.

783
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:01,722
Take me instead.

784
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,265
- Excuse me?
- I said...

785
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,560
take me instead.

786
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,021
Make Charlie an angel. I'll become human.

787
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:12,900
Please, Father.

788
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,571
Let me switch places with my son.

789
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,783
You'd do anything for your son.

790
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,034
Yes, anything.

791
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:24,828
[sighs]

792
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,082
If only fatherhood was ever that easy.

793
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,959
- [scoffs]
- [door opens]

794
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:33,712
[Michael] Good morning, brother.
Good morning, Father.

795
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,674
Are you ready to go home?

796
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,009
Are you ready?

797
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:42,346
[chuckles] Well,
I mean, I think it's time.

798
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:44,556
Good. Then you should go.

799
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,976
I've decided
to stay here a little bit longer.

800
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:49,812
You have?

801
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:52,189
Then I will stay with you.

802
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:54,400
I don't think that would be a good idea.

803
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,694
What...

804
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:58,195
what are you saying, Father?

805
00:44:58,278 --> 00:44:59,278
Michael...

806
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,616
you're no longer welcome on Earth.

807
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:08,330
[gasps, huffs]

808
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,540
You're banishing him?

809
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:12,960
- If you insist on putting it that way.
- But I... I don't understand.

810
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,129
Why am I the one being punished?

811
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:16,880
You're not.

812
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:18,549
[huffs]

813
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:28,016
[door opens, closes]

814
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,100
You see?

815
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:31,185
Never easy.

816
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,233
You have a futon, right?

817
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,038
[Lucifer] There he is.

818
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:09,266
- There he is. There, there!
- [Chloe] Oh.

819
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:11,435
- [Lucifer] Excuse me.
- [Chloe] Excuse us!

820
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,021
[Lucifer] Excuse me.

821
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:18,025
- Excuse me! Sorry, sorry.
- [Chloe] Excuse us.

822
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:22,654
[sighs] He must have seen us.

823
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:25,699
[shouting]

824
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,161
LAPD. Put down the gun!

825
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:32,414
[whimpering]

826
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,878
You weren't running from us.
You were chasing her.

827
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:38,796
Why?

828
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,172
She killed my son.

829
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:42,841
But you said <i>you</i> killed your son.
Make your mind up.

830
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:43,967
I would never.

831
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:46,970
I confessed because I thought
one of my children had done it.

832
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:48,764
I'd already lost one.

833
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:51,850
I couldn't bear to lose another.

834
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:56,063
[scoffs] So you were willing to
sacrifice yourself for your own children?

835
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,315
Of course. That's what fatherhood is.

836
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,693
You see, when I made bail,

837
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:06,782
I talked to all my kids, and I
realized that none of them had done it.

838
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:10,536
So then when I went to Betty
to talk to her, to see how she was doing...

839
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,037
[panting]

840
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,623
...and found she was skipping town,

841
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:18,544
then suddenly, it all came into place.

842
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:21,630
All I wanted to do
was burn that toxic place down.

843
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:25,092
Everything that was broken in him
was because of it, because of you!

844
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,219
He needed to get away.

845
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:33,642
So you stole gas from Hole in Juan,

846
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:36,103
and you tried to burn the place down?

847
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,438
But Chris caught you, didn't he?

848
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:42,776
[sniffles] We... we struggled.

849
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,114
He hit his head on the concrete.

850
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,618
Before I could do anything...

851
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:54,788
the fire was everywhere.

852
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,585
It burned so fast. [shudders]

853
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,337
My poor Chris.

854
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:07,426
I swear I didn't mean
for any of this to happen. [sniffles]

855
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,721
I'm sorry. [sobs]

856
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,934
So my son died...

857
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:18,729
protecting the Kingdom.

858
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:22,524
Protecting us.

859
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:26,820
It looks like
self-sacrifice runs in the family, eh?

860
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,615
Apple, tree...

861
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:31,700
[handcuffs clicking]

862
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:36,537
Lucifer.

863
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:38,498
Get the gun.

864
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:39,582
Right.

865
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:41,584
Right.

866
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:48,050
[dance music playing]

867
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,231
What?

868
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,360
What?

869
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:11,365
I was fully prepared to hunt
you down and kick your ass is what.

870
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:14,034
- [scoffs]
- In fact, I was looking forward to it.

871
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,703
- But you're just here.
- [exhales]

872
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,331
Why aren't you hiding?

873
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:20,414
Want a drink?

874
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,210
No!

875
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:26,630
What I want is a soul.
You promised me one, and I didn't get it.

876
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:29,675
No, I promised you
an audience with my father,

877
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:32,135
the one being who could give you a soul.

878
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:33,761
That's all.

879
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,391
[sighs]

880
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:40,060
[scoffs] Frustrating, isn't he?

881
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:44,398
What annoyingly arbitrary
and inscrutable answer did he give you?

882
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,445
That I'm perfect.

883
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,823
Just the way I am.

884
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:54,366
Ugh.

885
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,203
[sighs]

886
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,957
You wanted me to find you.

887
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:03,458
Why?

888
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,961
Because I'm leaving town.

889
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:09,131
And? You wanted to say goodbye?

890
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:13,427
I guess out of all
the wretched beings I've met,

891
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,054
I don't entirely hate you.

892
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,933
And for what it's worth, Mazikeen,

893
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,269
I'm sorry you didn't get what you wanted.

894
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:27,941
[sighs] I'm sorry you didn't either.

895
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:30,610
Doesn't mean I won't.

896
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:33,822
What does that mean?

897
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,533
That it ain't over till it's over.

898
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,498
- For either of us.
- [whooshing]

899
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:53,675
[sighs]

900
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:56,970
[slow-tempo music playing]

901
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:13,986
Hey.

902
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:15,905
Hello.

903
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:19,785
Do you remember
when I said that it might be useful

904
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:24,581
to draw a parallel between
your emotions and the case?

905
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:26,457
Yes.

906
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,542
So it turns out

907
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:32,714
our killer was an overbearing
girlfriend trying to change her boyfriend

908
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:36,134
because he couldn't deal
with his family issues.

909
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,470
So, you know, no parallel.

910
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:39,471
[both chuckle]

911
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:40,555
Whatsoever.

912
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,099
I think I was wrong.

913
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,975
[sighs] Apparently so.

914
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,268
[chuckles]

915
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:50,565
Lucifer, I'm so sorry.

916
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:54,069
You know, I was supposed to give you space

917
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:55,952
so that you could
deal with your issues and...

918
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,447
I didn't really help there, did I?

919
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:03,120
No, but then I ended up
using the case to rush you anyhow.

920
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:06,373
Detective, you have
been nothing but wonderful.

921
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,878
And you...

922
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:14,131
[sighs]

923
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,758
...you deserve
to hear those three words back.

924
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:22,097
But the truth is...

925
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,521
I'll never be able to say them to you.

926
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,525
I've realized that...

927
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,404
I am my father's son.

928
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,408
And as depressing as that is, it explains...

929
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:43,742
so much.

930
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:47,372
But it also means...

931
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,750
like him, I...

932
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:55,463
I am incapable of love.

933
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,092
Lucifer, I know you.

934
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,553
You do. You know I always tell the truth.

935
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:07,893
[softly] Chloe, I am so sorry.

936
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:12,105
But if I ever said
those three words to you...

937
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:16,026
it would be a lie.

938
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:18,862
<i>♪ Nobody, nobody ♪</i>

939
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:22,157
<i>♪ Nobody, nobody... ♪</i>

940
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:25,452
[Lucifer sighs]
