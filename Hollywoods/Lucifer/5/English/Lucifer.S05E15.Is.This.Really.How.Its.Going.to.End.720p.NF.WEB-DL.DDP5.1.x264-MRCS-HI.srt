He's, like, practically already in charge.

53
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,772
Exactly. Whispering in Dad's ear,

54
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,608

losing his powers in the first place,

55
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,152

What about the bruises?

140
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,846
[Ella] Well,
it looks like he was tied down

141
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,016
and forced to drink wine for
a couple of hours before he was shot.

142
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,602
So you're saying he was water-Bordeaux-ed.

143
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:38,064
- [chuckles] That's actually kind of funny.
- Oh! Ah!

I doubt there's enough
to match with anything.

00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:03,464

and a few days ago,

154
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:07,135
he got a really mean text
from someone named Mo.

00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,833
but I wouldn't want
to do it with anyone else.

174
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,378
And I appreciate
each and every one of you, so...

175
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,505
[inhales]

176
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,465
...it's not goodbye.

177
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,927
It's just goodbye for now. All right?

178
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:32,844
Thank you.

179
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,100
Did you know about this?

180
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:40,852
No.

181
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,732
But I got a pretty good idea
what it's all about. [sighs]

182
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,860
Or should I say who it's about?

183
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,580
- Hey.
- Hey, Dan.

184
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,333
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
- Oh, no, it's okay.

185
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,086
I get it. I think. [chuckles]

186
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,169
It's just...

187
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,215
- Wow. Wow.
- I know.

188
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,759
[chuckles] Ah!

189
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,470
I'm so excited for you, Chloe.

190
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,596
Thank you.

191
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,309
I, on the other hand,
am very <i>mucho</i> not excited for you.

192
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:24,105
I don't wanna solve crimes without you.
Come on, Decker, retire?

193
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,940
Is this really how it's gonna end?

194
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,484
What, you gonna take up scrapbooking?

195
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,194
You gonna foster cats, hmm?

196
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:34,657
I'm actually helping Lucifer
take over the, um, family business.

197
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,410
So you're both leaving?

198
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,161
Mm-hmm.

199
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:40,787
Cheers?

200
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:44,959
[shouts in Spanish]

201
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,043
[sighs]

202
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,670
This was my choice.

203
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,964
[Ella groans]

204
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,047
Sorry.

205
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:52,925
It's just...

206
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,636
Florida? You guys, that is so far.

207
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,054
Mm-hmm.

208
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,558
Oh, that's where
Lucifer's family business is, right?

209
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,893
- Uh...
- We'll be a, um... [clears throat]

210
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,104
...a tad north of Florida,

211
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,315
but, you know,
I'm still gonna be here for you.

212
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,233
I'm always gonna be around, you know,

213
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,735
but from a distance.

214
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,070
At least, I think that's how it works.

215
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,948
And, um, no need to worry.
For now, let's focus on the case.

216
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,534
Uh, did we find out
who sent the threatening text?

217
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,870
Mm-hmm. Odetta Watson.

218
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,498
Apparently, she's a psychic
with an office on Highland.

219
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:27,251
Oh, maybe she can divine us some clues.

220
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:31,297
Yeah, yeah, find out if I'm acquitted
of your murder after you abandon me!

221
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,387
[Lucifer sighs]

222
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:44,185
Let us all just breathe, open our chakras.

223
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:47,455
[Lucifer] Mind if I ask a few questions
before you get to yours?

224
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,983
- [Chloe] Mm-hmm.
- [Odetta] Shh! Listen.

225
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,028
The spirits are very loud today.

226
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,197
Yes, I think I can hear them.

227
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,114
Yes.

228
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,992
[Lucifer] My dad did give
some humans the gift, you know.

229
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,494
Maybe this is one of the real ones.

230
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:02,828
[Odetta] Excuse me.

231
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,038
Nothing.

232
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,415
Now...

233
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,960
Mmm!

234
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:14,548
I can feel your great uncertainty
in this time of change.

235
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,883
[gasps]

236
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:19,970
You are worried about a health issue.

237
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:21,555
[Lucifer] Um...

238
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:27,603
That could potentially develop due
to all the stress you are having over a...

239
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,440
professional opportunity?

240
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:35,069
Yes, I'm up for a big promotion
in the family business.

241
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:38,489
Right. Rig... oh, I can see it clearly now.

242
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,618
But there is strife within the family.

243
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,204
Right. 'Cause all families are functional.

244
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:49,834
And it seems you are not
the only one vying for the job.

245
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,836
Amazing. Yes.

246
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,838
- Mm-hmm.
- My no-good, manipulative bastard

247
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,549
of a brother is trying to steal it out
from under me. [chuckles]

248
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,592
In fact,
there are just a few swing votes left.

249
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:02,555
Can you tell me how to convince
my siblings I'm the right man for the job?

250
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,056
[Odetta sighs]

251
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:12,690
[groans]

252
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:15,776
You must lean into your strengths.

253
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,988
Lean into my strengths, that's genius!
[snaps fingers]

254
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,823
[laughs] I'm sorry.

255
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,283
[clears throat] Go ahead.

256
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,784
[Odetta] Hmm.

257
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,831
I am sensing
you are the skeptic in the relationship.

258
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,875
How is she even doing this? [chuckles]

259
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,419
So, why are you here?

260
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,130
We are here about Jonathan Donnelly.

261
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:38,549
Who is that?

262
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,177
He's the guy that you've
been sending threatening texts to,

263
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,262
and don't bother denying it.

264
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:48,267
Your phone records show
repeated calls and texts to and from him.

265
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:53,898
Oh. <i>That</i> Jonathan, yes.

266
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:57,485
Yes, I didn't know you meant him.

267
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,570
I have read for him in the past.

268
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,114
If you're a real psychic,
surely you would've known that.

269
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,117
Actually,
my specialty is channeling the dead,

270
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,161
and since Jonathan is very much alive...

271
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,663
- Actually, Jonathan is very much dead.
- [Lucifer] Hmm.

272
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,541
Tortured and shot in his wine locker

273
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,836
shortly after receiving
<i>your</i> threatening text.

274
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,631
Hang on, Jonathan is dead?

275
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:22,635
- And you think I did it?
- How did you not see that coming?

276
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,970
Because she's not a psychic.
She's a con artist.

277
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,933
You advertise that you can locate
lost items from dead relatives,

278
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,644
and you know who'd be
the perfect accomplice in that scam?

279
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,395
A tech from the ME's office,

280
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,106
who has access
to bodies and their valuables.

281
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,235
That is absurd. I would never.

282
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,612
One call to a judge,
I subpoena your records.

283
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:44,782
I get proof,
and you go down for fraud and murder.

284
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,243
Hang on now.

285
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,704
I didn't kill anybody. Okay?

286
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,748
Why would I kill Jonathan?

287
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,667
Our hustle was genius.

288
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,627
He would steal a valuable off a body,

289
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:01,757
plant it somewhere and then use targeted
online ads to direct the family to use me.

290
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,260
Mm-hmm. And then you'd magically
find the family heirloom.

291
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,511
Yep.

292
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:09,098
You may not be a real medium,
but that is an excellent scam. Respect.

293
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,224
Oh, thank you.

294
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,809
You're very welcome.

295
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:17,231
But you see why I would be
a total idiot to stop that money train.

296
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,733
- Right?
- Where were you last night at 8:00 p.m.?

297
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,403
Giving a reading...

298
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,781
to a programming exec

299
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,575
at Fox.

300
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,868
Oh, good luck with that.

301
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,287
So, just say that story checks out,

302
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,498
do you know of anyone else
who would wanna hurt Jonathan?

303
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:38,002
Maybe one of the other families
found out that their stuff was being sold?

304
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,587
What do you mean "other families"?

305
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,755
The ones that didn't bite.

306
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:46,927
Jonathan would give whatever he took from
their dead relative to a fence named TJ,

307
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:50,264
and then TJ would sell it
on the black market.

308
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,225
Great. What's TJ's last name?

309
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,395
I don't know.
But I know that he works out of Hollywood.

310
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,478
Helpful.

311
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,025
[Dan] Boom!

312
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:07,364
Rainbow Lasso, which means I get to
take Mr. Narwhal and put him in my stable.

313
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,742
No, Dad, you can only throw Rainbow Lasso

314
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,865
if she's in your hand
at the beginning of your turn.

315
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,412
Oh, come on.

316
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,497
You know what? These rules are confusing.

317
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,917
Or maybe I'm just better
at building unicorn armies.

318
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,252
- [scoffs] Yeah, right.
- I win.

319
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,336
What?

320
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,840
Come on! Again?

321
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,384
- Want another shot at the unicorn title?
- [scoffs] Yeah.

322
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:30,346
But I go first because
I'm wearing the most colorful clothes.

323
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,889
[sighs]

324
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,558
Okay, fine.

325
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,645
I'll lend you my glitter scarf,
and then you can go first.

326
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,854
But you have to wear it.

327
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,147
[chuckles] I promise.

328
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,274
Okay. And I have to go find it.

329
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,276
[Dan] Cool. I'll clean up our mess.

330
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,531
[knock on door]

331
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,784
[hums]

332
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,369
Hey, what's up, man?

333
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,038
Hey, hey, hey, hey. [chuckles]

334
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,082
- Dan, I figured it out.
- What's that?

335
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:01,293
Uh, what I'm gonna do here
now that I've decided to stay.

336
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,545
- Oh, okay.
- [sighs]

337
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:09,468
- I'm gonna become a policeman.
- [both laugh]

338
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,095
I mean, I really like helping people,

339
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,223
and what better way to do that
than putting away criminals?

340
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,266
[both laugh]

341
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,060
You wanna be a cop?

342
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,896
Won't it be great?
I mean, we can even work together one day.

343
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,442
Oh, yeah, yeah, an angel and a detective
solving crimes, makes total sense.

344
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,611
[laughs, stops]

345
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:31,240
- [clears throat]
- You don't think it's a good idea.

346
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,324
No, it's just that...

347
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,829
Bro, you're a freaking angel.

348
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,248
- [sighs]
- You were almost God.

349
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,419
I mean, there's gotta be something
that better suits your skill set.

350
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,506
So you think it's a bad idea
because I wouldn't be any good at it.

351
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,675
No, that's not what I said.
It's just that...

352
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,178
there are different kinds of people.

353
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,347
Different kinds of jobs.

354
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,807
[scoffs]

355
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,934
You know something? Of all people,

356
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,604
I really thought you'd be the one
that would be most excited for me.

357
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,567
- Amenadiel.
- [door opens]

358
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,861
Okay, that... that's not what I mea...

359
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,070
[door closes]

360
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,531
It's not what I meant.

361
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,994
[Saraqael] Why bother, Lucifer?
You're not getting my vote.

362
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,038
Yeah, I supported you once
in the rebellion,

363
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,498
but then I had to suffer
Dad's passive-aggressive wrath.

364
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,251
And try climbing out
of that proverbial doghouse.

365
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,671
And it certainly doesn't
help your case that even Jophiel,

366
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,382
who, let's face it, is an idiot,

367
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,176
even he thinks your pitch is lacking.

368
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:35,554
- Truth is I'm only here as a courtesy.
- [both chuckle]

369
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,557
Saraqael. Sara.

370
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,728
What is it you truly desire?

371
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:48,567
You seriously think I'm going to fall
for your silly little parlor trick?

372
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,904
[chuckles] A not-so-wise woman recently
suggested I lean into my strengths.

373
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,027
Too bad she didn't
teach you how to cut your losses.

374
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,909
I learned I needed to ask
not what the angels can do for you,

375
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,453
but what can you do for the angels?

376
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,330
I have no idea what that means.

377
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,915
It means you're right.

378
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,959
I shouldn't try and convince you
I'd be a better God than Michael.

379
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:09,129
What I should do is
the one thing I can do better than anyone

380
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,048
and that is grant favors.

381
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,884
So, again, I humbly ask you,

382
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,095
what is it you desire?

383
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,932
[scoffs] I'm an angel, Lucifer,
I'm totally above the base passions

384
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,142
and petty desires
that humans fall prey to.

385
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,394
Oh, my God,

386
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,979
is that Michael Voltaggio?

387
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,273
You mean
<i>Top Chef </i>champion Michael Voltaggio?

388
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,692
- Why, yes, it is.
- [laughing]

389
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,754
- Hello, Michael.
- You're Lucifer's sister, right?

390
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,488
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

391
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,573
Michael, is that really you in the flesh?

392
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,492
I mean, you...
I just... I can't, I just, I...

393
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,160
You! [laughs]

394
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,788
Your egg yolk gnocchi is divine,

395
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,582
and I should know, because I am an angel.

396
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:49,086
But you, you are such a bad boy,

397
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,964
and I am feeling hungry. [cackles]

398
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:55,217
[laughs] Anyway, Michael, would you
excuse us for just a moment?

399
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,553
- Sure, I'll just be over at the bar.
- [Saraqael] Okay.

400
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:03,559
So, I have arranged for you
to have the full Volt VIP experience.

401
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:08,438
A Friday night reservation for life
at Estuary, his new restaurant in DC,

for rice pilaf, and...

403
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,364
- ...his personal phone number.
- [gasps]

404
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:21,660
In exchange,
all I ask is for your support.

405
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:25,664
Wow, I mean,
I gotta hand it to you, Lucifer.

406
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:28,083
It's gonna be
really hard to say no after that.

407
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,543
Excellent. [chuckles]

408
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,253
Amazing, thank you.

409
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,922
[sighs] Well,
truth be told, Michael owes me.

410
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,509
How else do you think he won <i>Top Chef?</i>
That squab was inedible.

411
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,220
But still, I mean,
this is a really big favor to ask.

412
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,432
- Mmm.
- [gasps] You must really wanna be God.

413
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,936
Actually, why <i>do</i> you want it so badly?

00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:54,151
Um, well, you know,

415
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:57,613
because who... who wouldn't want it?

416
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,741
[chuckles] Right.

417
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:05,078
[inhales] You know what? I actually
need to think about this a little more.

My campaign to become God,

It can't be that bad.

Unlike this, our final case.

00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,770
[Ella] Size 13. Taken from the rubble
at TJ Ross' house.

466
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,271
Bigger than any of his shoes,

467
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,107
but it does match the shoe print
we found at the wine locker.

468
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,694
So whoever killed Jonathan Donnelly
also ransacked TJ's place?

469
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,697
They had to be looking for something
Jonathan stole off a corpse.

470
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,450
Given what was left behind,
I'd say they haven't found it yet.

471
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,119
But what is this object?

472
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,663
Who wants it? And why?

473
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:59,252

buy his enormous boots?

that you two are never gonna see because
you're running off to stupid Alabama!

We're definitely not going there.

- You would think that.

00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,524
Okay, everybody.
Let's focus on the killer.

480
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,193
Our priority now is TJ Ross.

481
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,277
We find him,

482
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,947
we find what the killer wants,
that might lead us to him.

483
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,491
So Lucifer and I will focus
on his friends and family.

484
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,743
And there are TJ's usual clients.

485
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:35,080
Yeah, but the client list we found
on TJ's computer runs in the hundreds.

00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:37,374

Why don't I get started on that list?

- [Ella] Yeah.

00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,929
You forgot this.

- It's my friend Carol's phone number.

- Come on, please.

but I have a theory. I can check it out.

00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,649
Yeah.

512
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:48,028
You're right.
Nothing says wrath like my demon face.

513
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:52,657
[exhales] But I still feel like I need
something that says, you know...

514
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,996
"I've returned to fiercely
rule over you for all of eternity."

515
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:02,792
But like, not in a needy way.
Think murderously aspirational.

516
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:03,876
Well, I...

517
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,463
I like the blue one.

518
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:07,826
Yeah, you're not helping, Linda.

519
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:11,510
Okay, is it possible that
you're fixating on this outfit because

520
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,553
you're really worried
about something else?

521
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:18,683
Well, I am worried that Lucifer won't pull
his head out of his ass and become God.

522
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,912
No, I was actually thinking
that you might be concerned

523
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,730
about becoming the Queen of Hell.

524
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,733
What would worry me about that?

525
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,986
Well, maybe that you have a soul now.

526
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:35,492
And you might be worried that that soul
might hinder the joy you once felt

527
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:36,826
by torturing others.

528
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,327
Yeah.

529
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,957
The whole soul thing, it isn't for me.

530
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,835
I'm the one who grew it, so I'm just
gonna let it slowly suffocate and die.

531
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:47,546
Like I did with Chad.

532
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,755
Who's Chad?

533
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,339
Doesn't matter.

534
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,010
Okay, so, um, Maze, listen.

535
00:25:55,053 --> 00:26:00,141
You grew a soul through the relationships
that you nurtured here on Earth.

536
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:05,105
Through the moments that you shared
with people who care about you.

537
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:06,356
Like me.

538
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,942
Are you really sure that you wanna just

539
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:12,904
suffocate
the wonderful times we've shared?

540
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,406
Oh, Linda.

541
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:17,951
I know what you're doing.

542
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,955
You don't want me to go so you're
covertly trying to get into my head.

543
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:26,126
No, I'm overtly trying to get
in your head. You don't have to do this.

544
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,752
Yes, I do.

545
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,965
- [door opens]
- The alternative is much worse.

546
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:35,760
Oh, there you are.
What <i>are</i> you wearing?

547
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,679
You look a bony xylophone.

548
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,265
Uh, Doctor,
would you excuse us just a moment?

549
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,309
I thought you'd never ask.

550
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,643
[Mazikeen sighs]

551
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,773
Have you heard of
any demons roaming the Earth lately?

552
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,066
Why?

553
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,652
There appears to be
a human with super strength

554
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,697
and a hurdling technique to match,
running around Hollywood.

555
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,490
I haven't heard of any.

556
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,200
But you never know.

557
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,411
The throne of Hell is empty, after all.

558
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:04,205
If you are concerned,
there is any easy way

559
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,916
for you to get the Underworld in check.

560
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,337
Yes, yes, get elected God
so I can make you Queen, I get it.

561
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:14,174
Just keep an eye out for rogue demons
and don't worry about the election.

562
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:15,884
I have it handled.

563
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,260
[Mazikeen] Do you?

564
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:21,139
Zadkiel is your last swing vote,
and he hates you.

565
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,599
Yes, he does.

566
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:23,850
But I have a plan.

567
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:29,898
I'm going to tell him something
I've never told anyone before.

568
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,317
What's that?

569
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,652
I was wrong.

570
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,114
I know, it's a miracle.

571
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:43,870
But as much as it pains me to say,
my rebellion was ill-conceived.

572
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:47,332
Why? Because
I did it for the wrong reasons.

573
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:50,126
I rebelled out of anger at Father,

574
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,796
out of a desire to prove
that I was better than him,

575
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:55,048
but I've changed.

576
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:59,427
I've spent my time on Earth
growing, getting over my...

577
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,222
[chuckles]...my Daddy issues.

578
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:08,269
I know how monumental his job
actually was and is now.

579
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,899
Those are big shoes to fill,
but I promise you, Zadkiel,

580
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:16,277
I will give it my absolute best.

581
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:18,737
Lucifer.

582
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:20,823
Wow!

583
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,909
That was well spoken.

584
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,869
Emotionally evolved.

585
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,371
Well... [chuckles]

586
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:27,454
Impressive.

587
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:32,127
Impressive enough to possibly
win over the Angel of Righteousness?

588
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,420
I mean, no.

589
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,838
It's always gonna be a no.

590
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:38,466
[chuckles] You don't wanna meet
Michael Voltaggio, do you?

591
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:44,180
I'm just here for the whiskey.
Jophiel said you bribed with top shelf.

592
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,807
[laughs]

593
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,434
And to watch you grovel.

594
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,147
Of course it was
never gonna work, was it?

595
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:58,987
All that nonsense about making peace
with Father and growing as an angel.

596
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,405
[chuckles]

597
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:04,826
Mm. You know,
the crazy thing is, it's all true, but...

598
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,370
[sighs]...it's not the whole truth.

599
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,461
You really wanna know
why I'm doing all of this?

600
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,671
Why I'm trying to become God?

601
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:21,634
I'm doing it for love. [laughing]

602
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,678
And it gets worse.

603
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,431
I'm doing it for the love of a human.

604
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:33,813
I am trying to be God
so that I can finally be worthy of her.

605
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:37,025
So there you have it, enjoy the top shelf.

606
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,903
[Zadkiel] This woman...

607
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,906
is she the gift Father made for you?

608
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:48,536
Her name is Chloe Decker,
and she is much more than that!

609
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,122
So yes,

610
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:54,000
I am doing this
for the wrong reasons again,

611
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,002
but do you know what? I don't care.

612
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:58,046
All I care about is her.

613
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:02,509
Which is why
I have to make this happen, and I will.

614
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,260
No matter what the costs.

615
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:07,013
With or without your vote.

616
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,318
[knocks]

617
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,657
Brooke Frier?

618
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:27,867
I'm Mrs. Frier.

619
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:31,704
Oh, I'm Detective Espinoza, with the LAPD.

620
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,083
Listen, we know that
you were a client of TJ Ross.

621
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,670
I'm not here
to trip you up about that, Mrs. Frier.

622
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:41,714
We have information
regarding a possible threat.

623
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,926
Somebody's after
one of TJ's stolen items,

624
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,887
and they've already killed somebody
trying to get it.

625
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,557
That's horrible.

626
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,100
Yeah. Yes, ma'am, it is,

627
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:55,520
and if I can find you,
well, then the killer can find you.

628
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,774
So I'm wondering if you've noticed
anything out of the ordinary?

629
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:03,528
You know, any strangers
lurking around or anything like that.

630
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:07,866
No, I haven't.

631
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,870
And if that's all, I should go.

632
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,371
Got a roast in the oven.

633
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,081
Sure.

634
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:18,459
Yeah, absolutely, thank you for your time.

635
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,669
You have a wonderful day.

636
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:20,837
Thank you.

637
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,854
[dialing]

638
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,981
[rings]

639
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,064
Hey.

640
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:42,941
Espinoza.

641
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,361
A possible home invasion.

642
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,780
Layton Street, Hancock Park.

643
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,407
Request immediate backup.

644
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,576
- [gun cocks]
- Hang up the phone.

645
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,045
[Ella] Two gunshots
to the chest, .45 caliber.

646
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,505
Same MO as Jonathan Donnelly.

647
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,507
I'd say it's definitely the same killer.

648
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,843
- [Lucifer sighs]
- [Chloe] Thanks.

649
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,680
Were they able to ping Dan's phone?

650
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,391
No. They must have turned it off.

651
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:19,228
I can't believe he came here alone.
I should have gone with him.

652
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:22,440
No, no, no, Ella, we can't go there.
Not yet, you know.

653
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:23,733
This house was ransacked too,

654
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:26,152
so maybe the killer
didn't find what they were looking for.

655
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:28,488
Which means they would
have incentive to keep Dan alive.

656
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:29,906
- Right. Right.
- Right.

657
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:32,158
So let's just do our job
and let's find him.

658
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,076
Okay.

659
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,452
Look at those flowers.

660
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:37,956
Looks like there was a scuffle.

661
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,584
He must have fought back.

662
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:43,543
[Ella] Guys.

663
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,172
He doesn't even have his phone.

664
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:47,882
This is bad.

665
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:52,136
No, no, this is Daniel.
He's... he's more than capable.

666
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:53,971
You're right.

667
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,516
Hey, hey.

668
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,394
I think there's something there, too.

669
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,396
Yeah.

670
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,274
Definitely seems like
there was some kind of fight.

671
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,567
Hey, you guys.

672
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,737
It looks like
there's something down there.

673
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:10,862
[Chloe gasps]

674
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,288
[exhales]

675
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,791
He left us a clue.

676
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,212
Dog tags.
French Foreign Legion, to be exact.

677
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,089
Been using the same one since the '40s.

678
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,590
- Got a name?
- [Ella] Yep.

679
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,260
Sayeed Faisal. Algerian.

680
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,678
Dishonorably discharged.

681
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:36,973
He's been linked to a ruthless
mercenary group led by this guy,

682
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:37,890
Vincent Le Mec.

683
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:41,394
We got running guns, kidnapping, murder,

00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,336
TJ the fence has it.

861
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:19,091
Which explains his super strength.

862
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:21,593
It does? How?

863
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,303
Well, think about it.

864
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,848
Every piece
of the Flaming Sword has a power.

865
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:27,558
Azrael's blade is death,

866
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,560
the hilt, to find love,

867
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:33,147
and your necklace is
the strength that binds them together,

868
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:36,400
strength that apparently lends itself
to whoever's in possession of it.

869
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:38,402
But my necklace has been
in human hands before.

870
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:41,697
It's never granted
any of them super strength.

871
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:46,493
Well, the hilt was only activated
when Azrael's blade was on Earth.

872
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:50,247
I suppose the same
could be true of your necklace.

873
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:55,711
Wait, but I thought you threw
Azrael's blade into Mom's universe.

874
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:56,794
I did.

875
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:00,841
But I also just sent Gabriel there
to send her a message,

876
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:03,761
and something tells me
she did not return empty-handed.

877
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,804
So Gabriel's working with Michael.

878
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:08,223
Smallest of our problems, brother.

879
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:13,437
Biggest being, Michael is trying
to assemble the Flaming Sword.

880
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:16,648
He's not trying to win an election.

881
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,484
He's trying to win a war.

882
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:24,031
[panting]

883
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,796
She's finally asleep.

884
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:41,548
[Lucifer sighs]

885
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,635
- Here.
- No, I can't.

886
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:47,679
[sobs]

887
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,768
It should have been me,
going to that house.

888
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:55,354
No, that's what I've been
trying to tell you, Detective.

889
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:59,566
This is all part of Michael's plan.
This is his fault, not yours.

890
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:03,153
I just keep playing it
over and over in my mind. I just...

891
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,488
[exhales]

892
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:11,036
This was my case,
and I let him go alone, and now he's...

893
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:17,000
[gasps] Please tell me that
this is all for something bigger, please,

894
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:21,421
that... that you're gonna win,
that you can... you can fix this.

895
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,006
That you're gonna be God.

896
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:27,219
[exhales] For that to happen,

897
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:31,306
[sighs]...I'll most likely have to
go to war with Michael, it seems,

898
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:37,604
and I don't have the greatest track record
when it comes to waging wars in Heaven,

899
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:42,901
and insult to injury, I didn't manage
to convince a single swing vote.

900
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,821
Zadkiel said no, surprise, surprise.

901
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:47,573
[inhales, exhales]

902
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:49,449
Honesty.

903
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,369
The engineer of my demise.

904
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:54,496
[sniffles] What does that mean?

905
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,499
Well, in a fit of candor,
I told him the real truth

906
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:01,169
as to why I was doing all of this,
and it went over like a lead balloon.

907
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,338
What's the truth? Why are you doing this?

908
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:06,717
Why do you wanna be God?

909
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:09,886
[sniffles]

910
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:14,600
[sighs] Because if I'm God,
then I'll finally be worthy...

911
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,644
of... of you.

912
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:22,399
So you're telling me...

913
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:27,195
[inhales]...that Trixie is in there
right now crying herself to sleep

914
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:30,282
and the real reason that
she's gonna grow up without a father

915
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:34,536
is because you still
don't know how I feel about you?

916
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,956
How is that even possible?

917
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:40,042
[shudders]

918
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,294
If that's the case, Lucifer...

919
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:47,007
then your brothers
and your sisters are right.

920
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,425
You shouldn't be God.

921
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:52,906
Excuse me, um, Ella? Are you Ella Lopez?

922
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:53,990
Yeah.

923
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:56,450
Hi, I'm...

924
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:58,537
I'm Carol Corbett.

925
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,663
As in...

926
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:04,292
The guy that
Dan was trying to set me up with. Right.

927
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:07,504
Yeah, yeah, um... [chuckles]

928
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:13,635
Look, I'm sorry to even... [exhales]

929
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,221
You know, I just...

930
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:21,852
Dan was always
just looking out for me, you know?

931
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,436
Yeah.

932
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:25,646
Me, too.

933
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:29,526
I think he was always
looking out for everyone.

934
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:31,778
Yeah, yeah, he was. [chuckles]

935
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:37,826
Uh, speaking of which,
there's a friend I need to talk to.

936
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:41,747
Of course, yeah. [sighs]

937
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:48,253
Hey, save me a seat, will you?

938
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:50,881
For sure. I will.

939
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:05,854
I know.

940
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,607
I can't believe he's gone.

941
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:10,817
Last time I saw him...

942
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:15,864
I said some things
that I can never take back.

943
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,617
I know. He told me.

944
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:20,869
He did?

945
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:22,329
Mm-hmm.

946
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,413
Yeah.

947
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:26,249
I was considering becoming a cop and...

948
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,253
I don't think
Dan thought it was a good idea.

949
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:32,297
[chuckles]

950
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,382
That's where you're wrong, Amenadiel.

951
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,886
That's what I came over here to tell you.

952
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,013
Day he died...

953
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:44,267
he turned in your application
to the Police Academy.

954
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:49,356
[both sigh]

955
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,945
At least we both know
he's in a better place now, right?

956
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,280
Yeah.

957
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,221
There's something I have to tell you.

958
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,849
I went to see Dan in Heaven.

959
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:25,016
Oh.

960
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:28,395
Let me guess.
Swimming in a vat of chocolate pudding.

961
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:31,356
He's not there, Lucy.

962
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,066
What?

963
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,192
He's not there.

964
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:35,694
Dan isn't in Heaven.

965
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:38,654
I just...

966
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:40,157
I went to check and...

967
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,617
But that would mean...

968
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:46,412
No.

969
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:49,207
No, Daniel dealt with his guilt.

970
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,333
He told me as much.

971
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:53,253
Lucy, you and I both know that guilt is

972
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:56,464
much more complicated
and deep-seated than we're even aware of.

973
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,090
That isn't...

974
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:01,136
[huffs] It's not fair.

975
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:02,637
None of this is.

976
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:23,241
When I first arrived
in Los Angeles, I was angry.

977
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:25,994
[chuckles]

978
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:31,416
I was angry and confused
about my place in the world.

979
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:33,627
I didn't know how to connect with people.

980
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,920
But Dan...

981
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:39,007
Dan did.

982
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:44,054
And he taught me how to be a good friend.

983
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,514
How to be a good father.

984
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,601
He taught me...

985
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:54,356
how to be a good man.

986
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:56,733
Because he was a good man.

987
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,362
The sad thing is
I think he forgot that sometimes,

988
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:03,281
but he was a good, good man.

989
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:06,201
Always trying to do right by others.

990
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:08,370
Always trying to do better.

991
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:13,416
Even though he was already
the very best of us.

992
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,755
What happened to Dan...

993
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:22,550
it isn't fair.

994
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,889
And you have every right
to feel angry about it.

995
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:30,557
But...

996
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:34,980
you can take comfort in knowing that...

997
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:43,238
that Dan is in a much better place.

998
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:49,535
Dan...

999
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:52,706
you are, and you...

1000
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,626
always will be my best friend.

1001
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,928
I'm gonna miss you, buddy. [sobs]

00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:55,907
<i>♪ It's so hard to say goodbye</i> ♪

1036
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:59,369
<i>♪ To yesterday ♪</i>

1037
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:02,038
<i>♪ To yesterday ♪</i>

1038
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:12,006
We found the people who killed Daniel.

1039
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:14,759
We made them pay.

1040
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:20,138
Okay.

1041
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,475
And how did that make you feel?

1042
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,559
[huffs]

1043
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:27,564
That's irrelevant.
My feelings don't matter.

1044
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:28,647
Yes, they do.

1045
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:30,608
You're grieving.

1046
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:34,028
It's important to acknowledge that.

1047
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:35,446
[chuckles]

1048
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:40,451
Such astute insight
from the doctor, once again.

1049
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:44,622
You know,
you are very good at what you do.

1050
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:49,460
But your job should simply not exist.

1051
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:54,591
You don't think helping people
cope with pain is important?

1052
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,759
I don't think pain should exist.

1053
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:00,887
I see.

1054
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:05,727
But that's life, Lucifer.

1055
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:10,982
Pain is inevitable.

1056
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,987
The suffering, that's optional.

1057
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:20,950
[shouts] Do not counsel me
on suffering and inevitability!

1058
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:26,289
There are no words to convince me
that the system isn't broken.

1059
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:29,834
Trixie shouldn't have to suffer the pain

1060
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:32,045
of seeing her father
ripped from her like that,

1061
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:34,380
and... and Daniel shouldn't be de...

1062
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:40,345
Dan should not be dead.

1063
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:45,391
The system is not only broken.
It's unjust.

1064
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:47,768
Lucifer.

1065
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:52,190
You can't control all the bad things
that happen in this world.

1066
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:55,902
Only how they affect you.

1067
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,487
That's where you're wrong.

1068
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:01,949
See, there is something I can do.

1069
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:07,372
Before, I wanted to be God
for the wrong reasons, but now,

1070
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:12,919
I no longer want to be God.
I have to be God.

1071
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,172
Lucifer, what does that mean?

1072
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:18,174
It means...

1073
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:21,302
[gasps]...that we are going to war.
