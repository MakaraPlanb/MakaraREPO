Thank you for finally agreeing

00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:32,115
Well, after 57 phone calls,
twice as many texts,

8
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,702
and the ill-conceived stripper-gram...

00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:38,580

Roberto came highly recommended.

10
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:40,999

12

but I really don't know what you can say
that's going to make a difference.

13

What are you doing?

19
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:11,154
Years ago, I faced a similar sense
of helplessness,

20
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:14,282
a lack of control in my life,
so I came here

21
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:15,825
to this very spot.

22
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:19,245

obviously, but...

24
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,835

to embrace metaphors...

25
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,295

I hope it brings you
the same catharsis it did for me.

00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,436

but you're not going to like it.

33

Well, tell me.

34
00:01:58,743 --> 00:01:59,828
I need time...

35
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,997

[Lucifer] Ah!

43
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:24,894
My apologies, Doctor. I don't mean
to barge into your home like this,

44
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,062

It's good that you're here, actually.

48

I need to speak with you
about the detective quite urgently.

49
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,075
She doesn't want me around
as she's dealing with her identity crisis.

50
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,243
Lucifer, you should know...

51
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:43,538
I should know better,
I need to be patient. Yes, I am aware.

52
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,330
Not what I was going to say,
but it's a good point.

53
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,918
The problem is,
if the detective focuses on work,

54
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,162
then she's just going to avoid
dealing with her issues.

55
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,590
I need to speed her along to
where everything's good again.

56
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,258
Yeah. Thing is, Amenadiel...

57
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,886
Is down in Hell waiting for me to return,
yes, I'm aware.

58
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,846
Why do you think
I'm in such a bloody hurry?

59

- Lucifer...
- Doctor,

60
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:04,934
I need to clear things up
with the detective before I go home,

61
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,604
because once I relieve my brother...

62
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,148
who knows when I'll be back?

63
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,818
It's... It's not like I can just
leave Hell unattended and...

64

There I was...

76
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,554
wandering the corridors of Hell, when...

77
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,139
I heard a voice.

78
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,809
A voice that I never expected to hear
in Hell.

79
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,269
Who was it?

80
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,772
Mother Teresa, Mr. Rogers?

81

82
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,940
Father.

83
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,611
Dad spoke to you?

84
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,694
Mm.

85
00:03:58,696 --> 00:03:59,696
Well, go on, then.

86
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,074
What did he say?

87
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,493
He told me that Hell no longer
requires a warden.

88
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,454
- And?
- And that's it.

89
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,041
So I came up here to see my son.

90
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,835
I've only been back a few hours, Lucy.

91
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,629
I was going to find you next.

92
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,464
Let me get this straight.

93
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,008
I just spent millennia down there

94
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,803
diligently doing everything He asked
without complaint,

95
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:25,431
and you have one sleepover in Hell
and Dad tells you your watch is over?

96
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,641
You know Father works in...

97
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:30,478
If you finish that sentence, I will
punch you in your "mysterious ways."

98

Is she all right?

102
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,114
Oh, I wouldn't know.

103
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,802
She's been keeping me at arm's length

104
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,867
ever since Michael told her
she's a gift from God.

105

106
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,244

107
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,289
Wait a minute, does she know that...

108
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,915
You're the one
who delivered the gift?

109
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:52,792
No.

110
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:56,462
Her brain was already plenty melted
without adding that to the mix.

111
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,804
I found the bitch.

112
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,849
Well, hi, Maze,
and good morning to you, too.

113
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:11,269
You were right.
That abandonment stuff you talked about?

114
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,396
Definitely her fault.

115
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,486
You found your biological mother.

116
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,570

the bitch.

118
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,451
Maze, I know your mother abandoned you,

119
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,495
but it might help
to understand her perspective.

120
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,289
Maybe...

121
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,294
Maybe she was too young to handle it.

122
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:40,381
My mother was 12,000 years old
when she had me.

183
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:51,781
Victim is Sister Victoria,
a.k.a. Victoria Reynard.

184
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:55,243
She was a novitiate who hadn't even
taken her final vows yet.

185
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,411
Cause of death, blunt force trauma,

186
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,496
back of the head.

187
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,219
Looks like it happened during a struggle.

188
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,166
Contusions on her neck indicate

189
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,418
that she was yanked from behind
by that necklace.

190
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,214
The bruising on her neck
doesn't match the cross.

191
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,675
I know. It's got me stumped, too.

192
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:13,386
Maybe there was something
on the necklace, and the killer took it?

193
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,221
Who were you talking to?

194
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,304
Over there.

195
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,767
[clears throat] Excuse me.

196
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:23,271
- Uh, which one of you found the body?
- I did.

197
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,773
I was the first to leave my cell
this morning.

198
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,650
Cell? Oh, sounds like a prison.

199
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,443
[Ella] Oh, yeah, "cell."

200
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,988
That's an old-school term
for their rooms.

201
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,656
Hi.

202
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,616
Longtime fan, first-time visitor.

203
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,618
Almost signed up myself, actually.

204
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,203
- I was just wondering...
- Excuse me.

205
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,038
Uh, Sister Victoria.

206
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:45,251
Had she been upset lately
or had a falling-out with anyone?

207
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,379
Well, Sister Victoria did just find out...

208
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:51,173
That she was being accepted
into our order.

209
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,050
She was so happy.

210
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,386
We're so blessed God sent you here

211
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,138
to find who did this, Detective.

212
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,305
Oh.

213
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,934
Mm, yeah. Well, yes.
That's what God does. Yep.

214
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,187
Mm. Sends me here, sends me there,
kills a nun,

215
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,899
just so I can meet all of you, and...

216
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,442
Um...

217
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,115
- Excuse us, we'll be right back.
- Frustrating.

218
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,822
Yeah, one second.

219
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,490
- What?
- What are you doing?

220
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,451
You can't insult them like that.

221
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,746
I'm sorry. That was unprofessional.

222
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,331
Yeah, well, more importantly,

223
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,416
you're making me look bad
in front of the nuns.

224
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,293
They're hiding something. It's obvious.

225
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,378
Well, I don't see them
opening up to you now.

226
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,839
Fair point.

227
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,384
Hey, I know I said that I needed space,

228
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,845
but I could really use your expertise
on this case.

229
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,681
I'm at a convent in Silver Lake
off Cole and Galvin.

230
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,785
How long do you think until you can...

231
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,268
[mystical whooshing]

232
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:45,393
...get here?

233
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,605
Oh. Of course.

234
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,440
Angel and all that.

235
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,488
How can I help you, Chloe?

236
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:09,919
Daniel.

237
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,587
[clears throat] Yes?

238
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,173
The detective doesn't want me helping
on her case right now.

239
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:15,503
I really can't imagine why.

240
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,259
You can't, actually,

241
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,680
but, uh, I need to speed along her work,
which is when I realized

242
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,182
that you, for once,
could be the answer to my problem.

243
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,305
Bracelet bros for the win.

244
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,604
No. Regardless,

245
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,982
I thought that you and I could help
her case along from behind the scenes.

246
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:32,983
- Hmm.
- Mm.

247
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,902
Well, what do you think you're sitting on?

248
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,904
This is Chloe's case. I mean, I'm digging

249
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,156
through background checks,
witness statements.

250
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,368
This is what you do every day?

251
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,329
What did you think I did?

252
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,873
Well, I don't know,
solve your own bloody murders?

253
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,041
[laughs]

254
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,419
Daniel, you're just a glorified librarian.

255
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,254
I do solve my own cases, Lucifer.

256
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,423
But we also support each other, and this,

257
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,050
all of this,
this is what real police work looks like.

258
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,845
Right, well, real police work
looks very boring.

259
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,223
Look, you want to help
speed along the case or not?

260
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,850
[sighs deeply]

261
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,569
Standing in these walls, it...

262
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,947
reminds me of being in the Silver City.

263
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,867
Wait, this is what Heaven looks like?

264
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,662
No, but there's so much love
for my father here, it feels similar.

265
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,875
And yet also so very different.

266
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,918
How can I help you, Chloe?

267
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,464
I do have to remind you that, uh...

268
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,591
I can't slow down time like I used to.

269
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,216
What?

270
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,553
I didn't even know that
that was an option.

271
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,514
Wow. Well, what can you do?

272
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,725
Well, I am God's greatest warrior.

273
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:48,642
[scoffs]

274
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:52,521
Well, as much as I love the mental image
of you punching a bunch of nuns,

275
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,149
the issue is they're freezing me out,

276
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,109
and I thought with you
being an angel and all,

277
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,069
maybe you could use that.

278
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,447
Chloe, I can't expose myself to them.

279
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,530
[gasps]

280
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,701
- No, not...
- [groans]

281
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,871
My angelic side, I mean.

282
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,808
That's not what I meant. I was thinking
more along the lines of, like,

283
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:12,917
Lucifer's mojo.

284
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,812
Do you have the same effect on people?

285
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,045
I'm sorry, I don't.

286
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,548
Are you sure?

287
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,135
[angelic choral music playing]

288
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,404
Thank you for coming back,

289
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,573
for being willing to listen.

290
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,498
Uh... [clears throat]

291
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,418
[sighs]

292
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,340
I haven't told anyone this.

293
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,975
I got pregnant when I was 17...

294
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:17,940
and I spent the entire pregnancy
in denial.

295
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,609
[sighs]

296
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,738
Even when I started to deliver,
I thought...

297
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,160
there had to be a mistake.

298
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,626
But then...

299
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,965
after the birth...

300
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,010
when I held her...

301
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,890
Well, there was no denying that...

302
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,769
[sighs]...she was mine...

303
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,023
and I was her mom.

304
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,989
But then they took her to the NICU and...

305
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,577
the whole thing...

306
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,580
seemed like a dream.

307
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,372
One...

308
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,377
One that I was completely
unprepared to handle.

309
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,799
Your baby was a nightmare. Got it.

310
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:26,925
No.

311
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,302
God, no.

312
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,014
No, she was perfect...

313
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,517
and beautiful, and...

314
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,150
And I didn't have the strength
to raise her.

315
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:47,737
[sobs]

316
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,909
And I didn't have the strength to face

317
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,203
giving her up.

318
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:57,997
So...

319
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:05,130
So when the nurses were away...

320
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,389
I left.

321
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,142
So you just...

322
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,230
You just walked away?

323
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,234
Is that why you think
you're going to Hell?

324
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:34,243
I thought I could pretend
it never happened, but the truth is...

325
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,538
The truth is, Maze...

326
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,166
I think about her every...

327
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,086
single day.

328
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,757
I've even tried to find her
a couple of times.

329
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,885
I wonder where she is now.

330
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,096
How she's doing.

331
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,016
She seems good.

332
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,436
What?

333
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,357
[Amenadiel]
We really appreciate you talking to us.

334
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,942
Oh, absolutely. I...

335
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,237
I feel like I can tell you anything.

336
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:15,117
Uh, do you know of anyone who would
want to hurt Sister Victoria?

337
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,082
Do you know of anyone who would
want to hurt Sister Victoria?

338
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,628
Well, I...

339
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,092
I'm not... I'm not sure.

340
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,933
Do you know of anyone who would
want to hurt Sister Victoria?

341
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,894
Yes. I do.

342
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,313
- Who?
- The Devil, of course.

343
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,106
Anyone else?

344
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,275
You are the most beautiful person
I've ever seen.

345
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,485
Thank you.

346
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:54,615
The question was, do you know of anyone
who would want to hurt Sister Victoria?

347
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,157
Oh.

348
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,869
Right. No, I don't. Sorry.

349
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:03,165
I don't know who would want to kill
that wonderful soul.

350
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,168
But you're hiding something, aren't you?

351
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,251
Yes.

352
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,671
It's a secret.

353
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:15,427
But who can lie to those gorgeous eyes?

354
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,640
So the mother superior of the nunnery
is a murderer?

355
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,518
Mm-hmm. Apparently, Mother Angelica
committed the crime years ago,

356
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,394
and then ran away and joined this convent.

357
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,896
She's been here ever since.

358
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,483
Most of the nuns knew about it,
but they were just protecting her.

359
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,277
Well, until you gave them
some of your mojo.

360
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,822
Yeah, I can't explain that.
That's never happened before.

361
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,200
Well, they're nuns, you're an angel.
Maybe they sense that.

362
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:40,827
Maybe.

363
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,789
Maybe. I'm just glad it helped.

364
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:47,960
Well, maybe our victim found out the truth
and wanted to go to the police,

365
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,920
Mother Angelica tried to silence her?

366
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,464
I'll have Dan dig into it,
see if that helps.

367
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,258
[woman] That won't be necessary.

368
00:18:56,552 --> 00:19:01,098
I'm sorry that my sisters tried
to hide my past sins.

369
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:05,394
It's only out of concern for me.
Please do not judge them too harshly.

370
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,354
Shall we?

371
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,822
I can't believe there's so much paperwork
for one single convent.

372
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,532
I mean, they're nuns, after all.

373
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,326
How many interesting things
can happen to them, really?

374
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,998
A single convent? Mm-mm.

375
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,667
These are all just the files
on Mother Angelica.

376
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,127
What?

377
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,211
Mm-hmm.

378
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,463
- This is going to take forever.
- Yeah.

379
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,275
It'd be much faster in person, Daniel.

380
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,967
I could seduce the truth out of them.

381
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,469
Bro, there are 30 nuns there.

382
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,721
I doubt that's faster.

383
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:43,682
- Well, it's certainly more fun.
- Come on, this is fun.

384
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:44,765
Is it?

385
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,686
A murder, man, it's like a...

386
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,646
It's like a gigantic puzzle,

387
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,570
only you don't know
what the corner pieces are,

388
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,447
or what it's going to look like
when it's done.

389
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,777
You just described torture.
Trust me, I know.

390
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,488
It could take hours, days,
years even, man.

391
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:59,615
Definitely torture.

392
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,784
I see all your self-help nonsense
has gone for naught.

393
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,705
But nothing in the world feels better
than when you find that one piece,

394
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:09,082
and then boom!
Suddenly it all clicks together.

395
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,126
Oh, hello.

396
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,672
Oh, I think I found the piece, Daniel.

397
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,718
Let me talk to them.

398
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,054
Shortcuts are not the answer, Lucifer.

399
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,013
Hard work...

400
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,807
[clicks tongue]...pays off.

401
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,643
[Lucifer sighs]

402
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:28,769
[elevator dings]

403
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,147
Ah-ha!

404
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,275
The detective already has a suspect.
Excellent.

405
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:39,780
Brother.

406
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:40,863
Oh, Lucy.

407
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,241
What on Earth are you doing here?

408
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,909
Chloe asked me to help on her case.

409
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,203
[laughs] Right.

410
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,122
You're not joking.

411
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,167
But I need this case solved quickly.

412
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,836
Much as I appreciate you
playing Detective Amenadiel,

413
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,840
perhaps you should leave it
to the professionals.

414
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,048
Like the Devil?

415
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,925
I'm a consultant.

416
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,552
I understand human desire. You're just...

417
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,554
Just the one who found our latest suspect.

418
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,722
Oh, really?

419
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:07,974
Really?

420
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:09,850
You know...

421
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,688
Chloe and I actually make
a really great team.

422
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,982
I can see why you enjoy working with her.

423
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,277
If you'll excuse me, I'm just gonna...

424
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,287
I grew up in Puerto Rico,

425
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,081
in the worst neighborhood
you could imagine.

426
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,041
When I was 16,

427
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,378
I killed a man in self-defense.

428
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,549
I fled here to escape retribution,

429
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:46,096
and eventually found reconciliation
in the arms of God.

430
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,725
But Sister Victoria found out the truth.

431
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,268
She did.

432
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,978
I informed her last week.

433
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,646
But she didn't accept it, did she?

434
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,273
She was going to report you,

435
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:59,443
and you felt like you had
to defend yourself once again, didn't you?

436
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,945
She was so understanding,

437
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,739
as all my sisters have been.

438
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,615
Detective,

439
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,159
I didn't kill her.

440
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:11,872
In fact, I was leading prayers
when Sister Victoria was murdered.

441
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:15,375
Well, unfortunately,
your alibi is a bunch of nuns

442
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,139
who have proven
that they'll cover for you.

443
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,337
[sighs]

444
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,888
Are you sure there isn't anything else
you want to tell us?

445
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:33,185
I can see why my sisters were so eager
to talk with you.

446
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:36,063
- [Amenadiel chuckles]
- If there was more to tell, I would,

447
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,314
but that's all I have.

448
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:40,150
Everything else is in God's hands.

449
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,444
If this is the path He wants me on...

450
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,155
He must have his reasons.

451
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:48,158
You're really willing to give up
your free will, just like that?

452
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,787
I am willing to have faith.

453
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,954
Oh, come on.

454
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,624
I know that look in your eyes.

455
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,877
Over the years our convent has taken in
many women like you,

456
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,339
women who feel powerless, adrift.

457
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:07,344
You have more control than you think,
my child.

458
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,389
[scoffs, clears throat]

459
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:11,931
Which is it?

460
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,517
Control or faith?

461
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,268
You can't have it both ways.

462
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:19,147
I have faith in you, Detective.

463
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,441
You help the helpless.

464
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,444
It takes great strength to do that,

465
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:28,949
and I think you have the strength
to find who really did this.

466
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,455
[Lucifer sighs]

467
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,750
What is taking so long?

468
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,128
[Dan sniffs]

469
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,172
Did you spike my coffee?

470
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,801
It's the only way to get through
yet another tedious and useless task.

471
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:48,884
You're welcome.

472
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:50,637
Phone records.

473
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,720
Come here.

474
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,683
They give us a sense of who she was,

475
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,446
or who might have had
a reason to kill her.

476
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,687
It's all about paying attention
to the details.

477
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,190
Well, how about this detail?
The detective already caught the killer.

478
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,484
You sure I'm the one
who's not paying attention?

479
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,405
Look, this number right here. Come here.

480
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,407
This one, it keeps showing up.

481
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,784
First at regular intervals,
then with increasing frequency

482
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,536
leading up to the time of her death.

483
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,706
Then on the day before her death,
it's all missed calls.

484
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:19,983
Victim wasn't answering her phone.

485
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,294
Maybe somebody got tired
of being ignored.

486
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,004
Well, that can't be right.

487
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:25,172
Why?

488
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,840
That's Destiny Page's number.

489
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,675
No one in their right mind
would ignore her.

490
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,260
Wait, Destiny Page, the pop star?

491
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,823
- Mm.
- How would you know her number?

492
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,930
- Funny story...
- Never mind, don't wanna know.

493
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:35,764
I gotta tell Chloe.

494
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,893
Well, as long as it speeds things along.

495
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,478
It actually might be a new lead.

496
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,103
Great work, Lucifer.

497
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,023
Take that back!

498
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,570
So...

499
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,698
Destiny Page.

500
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:53,949
So you know the name.

501
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,870
Why am I guessing it's not 'cause
you're a fan of her music?

502
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,164
'Cause she wanted to buy our convent.

503
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:02,125
But I didn't think anyone knew about it
other than me.

504
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,502
You turned her down?

505
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,545
Yeah, she was very upset.

506
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:11,593
Wait, do you think she had anything
to do with Sister Victoria's death?

507
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,676
We don't know.

508
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:20,185
Why would Destiny Page be calling a nun
at a convent that she wants to buy?

509
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,480
Well, her latest album was a testament
to a new-found faith,

510
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:26,363
and the one that she's working on
is supposed to continue in that vein.

511
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:29,778
Please don't tell Lucifer.

512
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,780
Your secret's safe with me.

513
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,908
So if Destiny is a new convert,

514
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,201
we should go talk to her.

515
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,293
Ready?

516
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,463
[sighs] Her name is Adriana.

517
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:52,133
I always wondered what they named her.

518
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:54,593
[Maze] Hmm.

519
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,637
Here she comes.

520
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,808
Hello, great to see you.

521
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:03,978
I...

522
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,063
You...

523
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,151
I can't believe it.

524
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,320
Excuse me?

525
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:16,074
That you look exactly like you do
on the bus posters.

526
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:18,159
[laughs] That's sweet, thank you.

527
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:19,827
This is Linda.

528
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,621
- She's your...
- Potential buyer.

529
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,251
I'm sorry,
I know we don't have an appointment.

530
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,669
It's fine, come on in.

531
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,004
Okay, great.

532
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,087
Welcome.

533
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,716
- Welcome.
- So pretty.

534
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,342
Oh! Thanks.

535
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:38,680
If you ladies wouldn't mind signing in,
thank you.

536
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,101
[mouthing indistinctly]

537
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:48,398
Seeing a house for the first time
can be very overwhelming.

538
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:51,651
I just need time to warm up to the space.

539
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:52,861
Take all the time you need,

540
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,504
and if you have any questions as we go,

541
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,114
- feel free to ask.
- I do.

542
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,198
Adoption.

543
00:26:58,742 --> 00:26:59,618
Yea or nay?

544
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:02,245
What my partner is trying to say is,

545
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:06,124
uh, how's the school district?
Because we're considering adoption.

546
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:10,128
Schools are great.
All the way through grade 12.

547
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:14,174
And personally, I think it's wonderful
that you're thinking of adopting.

548
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:17,218
I was adopted, actually.
Best thing that's ever happened to me.

549
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,302
Really?

550
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,806
Yeah, but do you have a problem
connecting with people?

551
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,267
Over Wi-Fi?

552
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:26,686
How's the signal?

553
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,438
I don't think there's been any problems.

554
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,190
How about maintaining relationships?

555
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,817
I'm not sure what this has to do
with the house.

556
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,903
This is... [grunts]

557
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,821
Sorry, you're right.

558
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:39,616
This looks like a beautiful home.

559
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:40,699
It really is.

560
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:43,328
I wonder why someone would abandon it.

561
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,622
- Okay, can you give us a minute?
- Of course.

562
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,250
What are you doing?

563
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,014
Trying to get you
to connect with your kid.

564
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,604
Oh, really? 'Cause it seems like
you're making it about yourself,

565
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,507
while trying to torture me in the process.

566
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:59,094
Or I am trying to get you
to tell your daughter the truth.

567
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,014
I can't.

568
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:06,725
[sighs]

569
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:10,271
You tracked down your mother
because you were ready to see her.

570
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,565
But who knows when...

571
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:17,946
or <i>if </i>Adriana will ever be ready
to see me?

572
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,029
[sighs]

573
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,535
I'm realizing it needs to be up to her.

574
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,412
Coward.

575
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:30,667
I'm not Lilith.

576
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,629
If you have something
you need to say to your mother...

577
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:37,424
you should say it to her.

578
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,357
Ah, wrong suspect. Rookie move.

579
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,641
You sure your powers are gone?

580
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,492
'Cause it feels like
you're slowing down time.

581
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,567
Because you always get the first suspect
right away?

582
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:01,932
Well, I've certainly never arrested a nun,
that's for sure.

583
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:07,203
Lucifer, I want Chloe to resolve
her issues just as much as you do.

584
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,496
Because you're feeling guilty?

585
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:09,872
Why would I feel guilty?

586
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,685
Because you're the one who performed
the miracle on the detective's mom

587
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:13,543
in the first place.

588
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:14,919
- That wasn't my...
- You what?

589
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,096
Go ahead, talk.

590
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,977
Years ago, at Father's behest,

591
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:35,398
I came down to Earth to lay a blessing
on one...

592
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:37,609
Penelope Decker.

593
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:38,692
Huh?

594
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:40,607
When my mom and dad were...

595
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,282
trying to have kids,
they said they'd just about given up.

596
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:45,909
And soon after my visit,

597
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,618
you were born.

598
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:54,249
Amenadiel.

599
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:57,962
You're my dad?

600
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,381
[laughs]

601
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:03,968
[clears throat] Of course not.

602
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:07,388
So "laid a blessing" isn't a euphemism?

603
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,474
Well, not in this case, at least.

604
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,851
No, Chloe, no. Lucy, stop.

605
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,063
Listen, Chloe,
your parents are still your parents,

606
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,358
and I'm so sorry that
I didn't tell you any of this earlier.

607
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,651
- I just...
- It's okay.

608
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:21,735
It's okay.

609
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,570
So...

610
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,699
I'm the only one immune to Lucifer's mojo.

611
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,450
So...

612
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,121
Do I have any powers, or...

613
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:33,872
anything cool?

614
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,586
I don't know, laser beam hands, something?

615
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,550
No.

616
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,845
No. Of course not.

617
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:51,975
They were just concerned with creating
the perfect Mrs. Morningstar.

618
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,228
Why me?

619
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:58,773
I don't know, Chloe.

620
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:03,236
Detective, when I found out
about this... manipulation,

621
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,904
I felt the same way as you.

622
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,825
But then I realized
that it's far from a curse.

623
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,158
It's a gift.

624
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:11,995
I only hope that...

625
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:15,456
in time, you come to see it that way, too.

626
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,835
There is a huge difference, Lucifer.

627
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,796
You were given a gift.

628
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,882
I <i>am</i> that gift.

629
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,136
I mean, I'm not even a person.

630
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,054
I'm just a thing,

631
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,015
created for someone else.

632
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,310
I...

633
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,271
Uh...

634
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,149
I got to get back to work.

635
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,821
- [Lucifer sighs]
- [door closes]

636
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,615
Well, that went well.

637
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:56,456
[woman] On five, six, seven, up, and go!

638
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,665
Give me some life.

639
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,460
Walk, one, two, three, four.

640
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,211
Try and stay on the beat, two,

641
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,589
three, four, and up, six,

642
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:05,548
seven, eight.

643
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,800
Come on, you guys. Two, three, four,

644
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,886
and five... Oh, my God! Cut!

645
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,471
Kill the music.

646
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:15,224
Destiny, you're great, but, guys,
we've done this 45 times already.

647
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,393
It is so bouncy.

648
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,236
Um, Detective Decker, LAPD.

649
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,905
I need to speak with Destiny Page.

650
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:32,075
I'm afraid Miss Page needs total privacy
while she prays.

651
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,159
Ah.

652
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,870
Well, Hank, uh,

653
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,997
as much as I respect that,
I need to talk to her.

654
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:41,292
Well, her schedule is pretty packed.
Uh, maybe next Saturday?

655
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:42,876
Mm.

656
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,379
Unless you have a warrant.

657
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,214
Yeah.

658
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,183
[mystical whooshing]

659
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,772
- [gasps]
- Whoa.

660
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:04,607
It's all right,
I've listened to your music.

661
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,859
I know you're a person of faith, so...

662
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,738
I'm pretty sure that I should have
a, um...

663
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:12,949
calming effect on you.

664
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,411
- That's right.
- Hank!

665
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,662
Hey!

666
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,249
Hey, what are you doing in here, pal?

667
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,559
- What's going on?
- [Chloe] Wait!

668
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,876
- Wait, he's with me.
- Is he?

669
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,378
What's he doing in here?

670
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,049
What are you doing in here?

671
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,811
I thought she might tell me
about the murder,

672
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,346
given how pious she's supposed to be.

673
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:39,934
But her recent music is clearly
just a collection of beautiful lies.

674
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:40,893
[Destiny] Murder?

675
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,145
Was someone killed?

676
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,813
Yeah. Victoria Reynard.

677
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,191
- Destiny, you do not...
- It's okay.

678
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,528
That's why she stopped taking my calls.

679
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,047
- So you admit to knowing her?
- Yeah.

680
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,071
She's my assistant.

681
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:55,408
So Mother Angelica refused to sell,

682
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:58,411
and what, you sent your assistant
to gather intel?

683
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,872
It seemed like a good idea at the time,

684
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:04,042
until Victoria fell in love with the life.

685
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,794
And then what?
You killed her 'cause she betrayed you?

686
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,838
What? You think I killed her?

687
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,423
I loved Victoria,

688
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:11,966
and I was happy for her.

689
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:14,594
Eventually.

690
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:17,346
But if it was all an act,
why were you praying when I came in?

691
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,139
I wasn't.

692
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,936
I've been sober for a month.

693
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,480
I was so tempted.

694
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,857
I guess I should thank you
for stopping me.

695
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,026
Where were you yesterday at 10:00 a.m.?

696
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,528
AA meeting.

697
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:33,612
Got my...

698
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,074
one month chip and everything.

699
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,117
Can anyone vouch for you?

700
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,243
I go in disguise.

701
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,287
Black bob wig, pink hoodie.

702
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:44,040
What about that one-month chip?
That would prove you were there.

703
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:47,210
I went to goat yoga after.

704
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,837
It fell out of my pocket, and you know...

705
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:51,672
they eat everything.

706
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,925
Are you saying a goat ate your alibi?

707
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,261
Hey.

708
00:34:58,805 --> 00:34:59,931
I need a favor.

709
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:01,057
[goats bleating]

710
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,354
[Lucifer] I suppose I deserve this.

711
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,398
Deserve what, exactly?

712
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:13,027
The humiliating tasks,
the tedium, the stink.

713
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,571
I shouldn't have tried
to rush the detective.

714
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,990
But you, on the other hand,
could move faster, Daniel.

715
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:21,536
Lucifer, if you want this to go faster,
you could actually help, for a change.

716
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:22,953
Oh!

717
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,247
Very well.

718
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,177
[woman] Put it in the box.

719
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,429
What is this?
You don't need to wrap everything.

720
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,767
Can you put that in faster?

721
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:48,604
Excuse me.

722
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,399
Uh, where's the woman that lived here?

723
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,651
Lily Rose? She died a couple days ago.

724
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,611
Left a ton of junk.

725
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:00,867
Was she someone to you?

726
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,160
You want any of this stuff?

727
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,243
No.

728
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,539
Maybe, uh...

729
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:08,456
Can I just...

730
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,543
have a minute, please?

731
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,086
Sure. Hey, guys, come on.

732
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,787
We're... We're clearing the room.
Let's get out of here.

733
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:27,185
["Paradise" by Anderson Rocio plays]

734
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,466
[screams]

735
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:12,939
Nice bracelet.

736
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,190
I wouldn't normally wear it,

737
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,984
but my friend Daniel said
he needs his chakras realigned,

738
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,153
so I'm doing it for him, really.

739
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,238
This is how you help?

740
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,321
Really?

741
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,949
Daniel! I'm...

742
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,742
What do you call it? Canvassing.

743
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,662
And it pains me to say you were right.

744
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,145
I put in the work, and it paid off.

745
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:30,997
What do you mean?

746
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,458
Well, I interviewed everyone,

747
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,377
and when I spoke to lovely Amberley here,

748
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,963
she confirmed that someone attended class

749
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,840
with black hair cut into a bob
and wearing a pink hoodie.

750
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,009
Great.

751
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,762
Well, according to the transcript
the detective sent over,

752
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,472
that's what Destiny Page was wearing.

753
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,475
Wait, you actually read the transcript?

754
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,520
No shortcuts, Daniel.

755
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:54,813
[chuckles]

756
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:55,855
[chuckles]

757
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,358
Well, perfect timing,

758
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:00,569
because we just confirmed
that Destiny Page isn't our killer.

759
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,198
So we're back to square one.

760
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:06,993
Yeah.

761
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,160
[Lucifer sighs, groans]

762
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:12,999
Daniel, would you stop staring?
Can't you see the woman's engaged?

763
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:14,499
Yep.

764
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,585
That's exactly what I see.

765
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,258
Ha!

766
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:24,759
Thank you.

767
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:36,646
What?

768
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,482
I admire you.

769
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,191
Oh, yeah?

770
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:41,527
Yeah.

771
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:45,448
You hit dead end after dead end,
but you still keep on searching.

772
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,366
Doesn't deter you.

773
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,411
In fact, it only drives you to try harder.

774
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,538
You make me sound like a sadist.

775
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,999
[chuckles] No.

776
00:38:57,084 --> 00:39:00,296
You see, for eons,
I was God's right hand, you know?

777
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:04,592
And for most of the time, I had no idea
why I was doing what I was doing.

778
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,636
But watching your perseverance,

779
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,264
to see you keep digging
for the truth, it's...

780
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,767
[exhales]...it's inspiring.

781
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:16,687
And I wish I would have had
the same curiosity, because then...

782
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:21,108
maybe I would have had the answers
that you're asking for, Chloe.

783
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:26,405
But unfortunately, I don't.

784
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,202
And neither does Lucifer.

785
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,348
- [Lucifer] I know who the killer is.
- [Dan] <i>We</i> know who the killer is.

786
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,581
- We.
- Yeah.

787
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:38,459
Okay, so that mysterious contusion
around Victoria's neck?

788
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,662
It's consistent with a ring.

789
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,753
An engagement ring,

790
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:43,796
which you wear around your neck to stop
goats from eating it off your hand.

791
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,508
Or when you're undercover in a nunnery.

792
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,351
Those aren't the only two reasons,
obviously.

793
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,011
Bracelet bros for the win.

794
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,095
[mock explosions]

795
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:57,686
Well, I could see why a fiancé would be
upset she had embraced the life of a nun.

796
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,772
However, we have no proof,

797
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,108
no idea who the fiancé is.

798
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:04,485
We don't even know if the fiancé
is a "him."

799
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:05,837
- [Lucifer] Right.
- So for now...

800
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,341
- [Sister Francine] Excuse me.
- Yeah?

801
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,991
Is there somewhere we could speak
in private?

802
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:14,703
- Of course.
- I... I meant with him.

803
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:22,752
You're nervous.

804
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,506
It's all right, Sister Francine.

805
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,589
You can trust me.

806
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,094
I've wanted to do this
ever since I met you,

807
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:31,554
but I'm scared.

808
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:32,638
I understand.

809
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:33,973
I do, but listen...

810
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:38,894
once you admit the truth, you are
gonna be amazed at how good it feels.

811
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,231
I've never done anything like this before.

812
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:43,815
I haven't, either.

813
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,192
It's just...

814
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,695
I'm a woman of faith.

815
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,156
Well, you see, that's all the more reason.

816
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,951
Because you, Sister Francine,

817
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:57,621
you of all people know
what you need to do.

818
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,876
[trembling breaths] Right here?

819
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:04,836
Right now?

820
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:06,754
Yes.

821
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:08,924
Just let it all go.

822
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:13,678
[Amenadiel] Mm...

823
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:15,657
- Wow.
- [grunts repeatedly]

824
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:18,058
Remember, Daniel, there are no shortcuts.

825
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,769
[Amenadiel straining]

826
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,146
Let him put in the work.

827
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:24,063
Good point.

828
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,774
[Amenadiel grunting]

829
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,319
What are you doing?

830
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,029
I'm letting go.

831
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,447
Like you said, I...

832
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,367
I'm admitting the truth
of my feelings for you.

833
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,244
That's... That's not what I meant.

834
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,040
This is wrong.

835
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,043
[shuddering breaths]

836
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,920
I'm a nun.

837
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:49,131
I love God, it's just...

838
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:51,884
when I look at you, I...

839
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,470
get this feeling
that I've never had before.

840
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,224
What does that say about me?

841
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,187
What are you feeling?

842
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,189
It's going to sound absurd, but...

843
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:08,067
I feel as if I'm closer to God.

844
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,239
But that's not exactly it, it's...

845
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:16,242
Like your love for God
is being reflected back at you...

846
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:19,869
through me.

847
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:22,830
Yes.

848
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,167
That's exactly it.

849
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:26,794
How did you know that?

850
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,880
I didn't even know that
until you just said it out loud.

851
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,760
I'm starting to understand something.

852
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:41,559
Wait, this is what you came to talk about?

853
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,143
What did you think I came for?

854
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,770
The murder of Sister Victoria.

855
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:47,982
I wish I could help.

856
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:50,024
Maybe you can.

857
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,320
Did she ever mention a boyfriend?
A fiancé?

858
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:55,948
What about any visitors?

859
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:57,366
She usually liked to be alone.

860
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:01,745
She did say that she discovered
a secret room no one knew about, and...

861
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,582
she liked to go there to be by herself.

862
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,125
Thank you.

863
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:08,919
So if Sister Victoria knew
about a secret room...

864
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,463
Seems like the perfect place
to meet a secret fiancé.

865
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:14,258
Find the room, maybe we can find
some evidence to ID him.

866
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:15,341
Yeah.

867
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:29,273
Lucifer, I know what you're thinking.

868
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:32,276
That once this case is solved,

869
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:36,989
I'll have magically figured everything out
and it'll all be fine, right?

870
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:40,159
Well, I'm definitely not
thinking that now.

871
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:44,412
I...

872
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,665
I want us to be together.

873
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,167
I really do.

874
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:50,835
I just don't...

875
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,256
I don't know how long
it's going to take me to get over this.

876
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:58,719
- I may never...
- I understand, Detective.

877
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:02,388
You do?

878
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,433
There are no shortcuts.

879
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:07,269
Just... take all the time you need.

880
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,230
Are you sure?

881
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:13,274
Okay.

882
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,165
It's gotta be here.

883
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,418
It's gotta be here somewhere.

884
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:34,755
[mechanism unlocks]

885
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,426
[door creaks]

886
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,395
[Amenadiel] How'd you find this?

887
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:53,065
Well, I realized that Destiny Page
might have the blueprints

888
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:55,192
since she was interested
in buying the building.

889
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,659
[Amenadiel]
And since Victoria worked for her,

890
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,405
that's how she knew
about the secret place.

891
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:02,157
Yeah, and one call to her reps,

892
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:03,783
bingo.

893
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:05,327
Secret cellar.

894
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:10,874
Okay, so what are we looking for here?

895
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,668
Something out of place.

896
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:14,628
Something new.

897
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:18,966
Something a nun wouldn't have.

898
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,471
Something...

899
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,350
with fingerprints.

900
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:31,812
[Hank] I really wish you hadn't found that
before me.

901
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:33,307
- [Chloe sighs]
- [gun cocks]

902
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,236
Hi, Hank.

903
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:44,616
I guess when I asked for the blueprints...

904
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:47,177
you figured out what I was looking for.

905
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:48,703
Yeah.

906
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:53,417
Did Destiny Page know
that you were engaged to her assistant?

907
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:56,837
Nah, she was too busy working on
her religious image all day,

908
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:59,089
getting hammered all night to notice.

909
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,758
Not much of a believer, huh?

910
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,843
Oh, it's such a scam.

911
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:06,054
Victoria thought so, too,
until she came here.

912
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,265
She broke up with you, and you killed her?

913
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:10,768
I just wanted to talk some sense into her,

914
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,144
but we started to fight,

915
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,062
and I wanted the ring back. I...

916
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,982
I didn't mean to push her so hard.

917
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:19,525
Why?

918
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:22,237
Why would she choose this place over me?

919
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,322
We had something real.

920
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:24,990
Instead, she left me for

921
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:26,742
made-up nonsense!

922
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:28,869
I think we've heard enough, right?

923
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,621
Plenty.

924
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,710
Now, that is very gentlemanly of you...

925
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,004
to die first.

926
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:44,926
[Chloe gasps]

927
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,930
How the hell?

928
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:49,681
What if it wasn't fake?

929
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:55,771
What if it was more real than even
she could possibly know, and you, Hank,

930
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,857
- you took that away from her?
- No, no, no...

931
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,235
It's impossible.

932
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,071
[gasps]

933
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,032
[Hank] Oh, God.

934
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:11,036
Have faith, Hank.

935
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,621
No.

936
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:14,497
[grunts]

937
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:29,179
[police chatter on radio]

938
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:31,890
Get him away from me.

939
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:35,102
Stay away from me! [grunts]

940
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:39,565
I thought you weren't supposed
to expose yourself.

941
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:41,399
Oh, I'm not.

942
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:44,570
But for what he did, it felt appropriate.

943
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:47,197
Yeah, well...

944
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:52,494
When you find out that it all
really does exist, it can be punishing.

945
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,121
Trust me on that.

946
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:56,706
Yeah.

947
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:59,042
I wanted to talk to you about that.

948
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,629
Chloe, I think I know why
the nuns were drawn to me.

949
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:04,131
Why is that?

950
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:08,886
Sister Francine said she felt God's love
more than ever when she was with me.

951
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,555
You know, when she was in my presence.

952
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:12,723
Well... [chuckles]

953
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,559
Yes, you are an angel.

954
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:19,146
I am, but I'm pretty sure that
she was seeing her own faith

955
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:21,106
reflected back at her.

956
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:23,941
Okay.

957
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,736
Why... Why do you say that?

958
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:28,113
Lucifer, actually.

959
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:33,368
Men, women, they're all drawn to him
because he pulls out people's desires.

960
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:36,079
But what if the reason that
they're drawn to him

961
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,040
is because of that?

962
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,375
So you're saying Lucifer...

963
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:43,503
reflects people's desires back to them?

964
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:46,506
Well, who wouldn't want to be
with their greatest desire?

965
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,049
Well, yes, I...

966
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:53,055
I agree, but when I look at him,
I-I-I don't see that.

967
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,351
Which would mean that...

968
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:00,103
That you're the only mortal
who sees him...

969
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:03,065
for who he truly is.

970
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:05,817
[gasps]

971
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:08,694
So...

972
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:12,282
So everything we shared and...

973
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:17,537
Everything I was afraid
was a manipulation...

974
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,122
Is as real as it gets.

975
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:24,127
You're not the gift, Chloe.

976
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:26,879
That is.

977
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,099
Yes, but I...

978
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,810
But I make him vulnerable.

979
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:44,064
That's something else
I wanted to talk to you about.

980
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,071
What's this?

981
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:55,158
A database release form
for biological parents.

982
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:59,204
So that their adopted kids can find them
if they want to.

983
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:02,249
It's like bounty hunting
for your mother and father.

985
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:08,463
Thank you, Maze.

986
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:11,842
This is perfect.

987
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:17,472
You need to give your daughter
the choice...

988
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,390
okay?

989
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,183
You have to.

990
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,566
You saw your mother, didn't you?

991
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:34,156
What did you say to her?

992
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:35,990
Nothing.

993
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,953
I didn't get to say that "I hate you."

994
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:42,539
I didn't get to say that "I forgive you."

995
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:45,584
I didn't get to say anything.

996
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:52,174
Because she's gone.

997
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,303

Well, I had a...

1007
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:54,569
interesting conversation with Amenadiel.

1008
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,697
Please tell me you're not making him
police consultant.

1009
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,407
- Anything but that.
- [chuckles]

1010
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:04,663
No, actually. He has, um, a theory

1011
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:07,541
about why I make you vulnerable.

1012
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:10,418
Oh. Do tell.

Well...

1014
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,508
His theory is that...

00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,300
I don't.

1016
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:22,055
