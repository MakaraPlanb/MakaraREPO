The new God. Isn't that great?

7
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:29,988
So your Dad's gonna retire,
and he chose you to replace him?

8
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:33,158
Well, not in so many words. He asked
me and Amenadiel to keep it a secret,

9
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:35,201
so it's obvious
he wants it to be one of us.

10
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:38,997
- And Amenadiel doesn't want it?
- Nope. It's all mine.

11
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:42,959
What about all the other angels?
Are they gonna be okay with this?

12
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,045
No, they'll have
more opinions than Twitter,

13
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,338
but Heaven's never been a democracy.

14
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,799
It's best they don't find out
until Dad makes it official.

But why you?

16
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:55,889
Because I would be
a much better God than my father ever was.

17
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:59,184
No, but why would you even want to be God?

Lots of changes when I'm in charge.

21
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:10,445

Sorry.

26
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,007
[sighs] I guess I'm just

27
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:35,095
trying to wrap my mind
around what all of this means.

28
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,097
- Means?
- For us. Yeah.

29
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,101
Oh, well, it won't change a thing.
In fact, things will only get better.

00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,860
I'll be there for you whenever
and wherever you need me.

33
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,279
I'll know exactly what you're thinking.

34
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,448
That's not at all dangerous.

35
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:59,494
Well, I'll know exactly when you want me
to do that <i>thing</i> you like, for example.

You need time to process.
Of course you do.

Well, in the meantime,
how about business as usual?

the water filling your lungs
as you scream

51

from the sheer terror of it all?

Yeah.

56
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:03,892
[Lucifer] Sharks, one of Earth's
most misunderstood creatures.

57
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,686
Definitely correcting that when I'm God.

58
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:11,316
So, who do we have here?

59
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,985
Bruna Lorenzoni, 33,
chief operator of the aquarium.

60
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:17,864
- Pieces were found scattered in the tank.
- Obviously, death by shark, right?

61
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:18,947
Wrong!

62
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:25,413
See, this wound right here
is way deeper than any sort of tooth.

63
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:28,416
Cleaner cut too,
made by some sort of blade.

64
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,627
She was dead before she hit the water.

65
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,088
So the killer dumped the body,
hoping the sharks would hide the murder?

66
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,007
Should've known
we'd smell something fishy.

67
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,844
- Aww, Dad joke, nice.
- Thanks. I'm practicing.

68
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,639
We've located
all of her pieces except her left arm.

69
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,016
And the fingernails
on the hand we do have

70
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:48,353
show some sign of struggle,
so I sent the samples back to the lab.

71
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:51,981
Her pieces were in the water
for a long time, so it's gonna be tough,

72
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,109
but maybe our victim
nabbed some of the killer's DNA.

73
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,320
- Who found the body?
- Elizabeth Newman.

74
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,488
The aquarium's owner.

75
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,407
I came in this morning because
Bruna wasn't returning my calls.

76
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,369
I never imagined I'd find her like...

77
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,662
like that.

78
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,707
Oh, this is a nightmare. I don't know
how to do any of this without her.

79
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,001
Do you know of anyone
who would want Bruna dead?

80
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,920
No, I have no idea.

81
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:17,757
She was a pillar
of our marine conservation community.

82
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,427
Oceans wouldn't need saving if my father
hadn't been slacking. Just saying.

83
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,807
Who had access
to the aquarium grounds after hours?

84
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,143
[hesitates] I don't know.
Bruna ran everything.

85

00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:40,196
when I'm God, I'll know
the answers to all your questions.

89
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,365
No more asking
useless people like Lizzie here.

90
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,702
Okay, well, you are not God yet,
so that is not helpful right now.

Well, I'm just trying to get you as
excited about my new promotion as...

92
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:51,957
I am.

95
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,798
You weren't answering your phone.

96
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,049

98
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,054
Really?

99
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,225
But why do you look so worried?
He's still retiring, isn't he?

100
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,894
Oh, yeah,
that's definitely still happening.

101
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,855
Excellent. Well, I should go talk to him

102
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:17,025
and get his blessing before
our meddlesome siblings find out.

103
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,692
Yeah.

104
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,278
About that...

00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,517
I didn't get an invitation.

00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,102
Not even Gabriel's e-vite?

111
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,147
Well, she emails too much.
I send her straight to spam.

112
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,359
Hi, guys! Heard you talking about me.
Long time no see. Glad you could make it.

113
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,402
- Archangels, assemble!

114
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,446
Azrael says hi, wishes she could be here,

115
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,531
but you know,
no rest for the Angel of Death.

116
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,658
[both sigh] Hey, Gabriel.

117
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:11,412
So, Amenadiel,
someone's been a busy angel.

118
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,915
Spill. I wanna know everything
about your baby mama.

119
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:16,292
Like I would tell anything
to the Angel of Gossip.

120
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,504
- [chuckles]
- It's Angel of Messages, but whatever.

121
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,464
I got plenty of hot goss without you.

122
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,674
Have you heard?

123
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,302
Dad's getting old, and he's losing it.

124
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:27,762
Who told you that?

125
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:28,846
Michael.

126
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,973
At first we were like, "What? No way!"

127
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,434
But then we heard that
Dad was making people sing,

128
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,896
turned himself mortal,
lost his powers, exploded a human.

129
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,564
He put the human back together again.

130
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,025
Can we please talk about
the immediate problem here?

131
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,570
Like all of us archangels
gathered here on Earth,

132
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,407
out in the open
for all of humanity to see!

133
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,368
Relax, brother, this is LA.
No one will even notice.

134
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,495
Anyway, if you'll excuse us, sister,

135
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,622
we would like to have
a chat with dear old Dad.

136
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,000
[chuckles] Remiel.

137
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,836
It's good to see you, brother.

138
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,004
Sister.

139
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,633
Ha! Nothing.

140
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:10,471
Who invited the Devil
to our gathering of angels?

141
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,473
Brother Zadkiel,

142
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:16,185
still taking your Angel of Righteousness
role too seriously, I see.

143
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,521
[inhales, spits]

144
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,483
How dare you!

145
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,780
That's not a godly way to behave, Lucy.

146
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,407
You're right.

147
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,201
Excuse me.

148
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,501
Hello, my sons.

149
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,503
Welcome to my retirement party.

150
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,338
Can you smell what I'm cooking?

151
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,591
I learned that phrase from Linda.

152
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:49,594
Dad, I thought your retirement
was supposed to be a secret.

153
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,157
It was, and thank you for keeping it.

154
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,932
Father, we couldn't find you after
you disappeared from Lucifer's penthouse.

155
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,393
Were you off planning your retirement?

156
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,354
- Oh, I should do that, shouldn't I?
- [Gabriel] So, Dad.

157
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,399
Since you're retiring, there'll be
a new you, right? Who's it gonna be?

158
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,110
If it's a secret, whisper it in my ear.
I won't tell a soul.

159
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,529
[Remiel] It's obvious
who will replace Father.

160
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,865
- It's Amenadiel.
- [woman] Yes!

161
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:14,911
[scoffs] Well, actually,
it's not going to be Amenadiel.

162
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,413
It's going to be
the handsomest of us all.

163
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,539
Hanjobadiel?

164
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,874
No, not Hanjobadiel.

165
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:22,919
It's going to be me.

166
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,462
- [murmuring]
- What?

167
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:27,507
- No.
- Amenadiel, tell him it's you.

168
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,803
Remy, I'm sorry, but, uh...

169
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,390
Lucifer has my full support.

170
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,768
How can that be?
Of all the angels that are worthy...

171
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,686
Who is more qualified than me?
Good point.

172
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,524
I ran Hell for millennia.
Have any of you run your own kingdom?

173
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,026
Even so much as a taco truck?

174
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,822
[exhales] Didn't think so. [sniffs]

175
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,825
Brother, you know
I've always followed your lead.

176
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,036
Okay? But I cannot support the Fallen One.

177
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,289
Father, this is your choice.

178
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,625
Not theirs.

179
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:07,213
Tell us who you choose
to be your successor. Please.

180
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:11,509
Why don't you stay out of this with your
swirly staff and your bloody medieval...

181
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:14,637
Children, children,
please, one thing at a time.

182
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,807
My retirement plan, then my successor.

183
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,890
[groans]

184
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,645
But first, who wants
another hot dog? [laughs]

185
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,652
[groans]

186
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:33,614
Detective, I'm afraid that there has been
a speed bump in my road to becoming God.

187
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,907
Oh, no, really?

188
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:38,619
Yes, before Dad names me God 2.0,
he needs a retirement plan.

189
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,622
So, I thought, what better way
to prove that I'm God material

190
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,916
than to make his plans for him?

191
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,753
Huh. Okay. Got it.
Well, in Earthly matters,

192
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,339
we finished interviewing
everybody at the aquarium,

193
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,259
and aside from
a few endangered fish gone missing,

194
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,011
we've learned that... Lucifer.

195
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,430
- Hmm?
- We have a lead.

196
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,056
On one of these retirement homes?

197
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,641
- No, on the case.
- Oh.

198
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,352
A few employees said
Bruna was arguing with her husband.

199
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:07,607
They overheard him making threats to her
on some screaming match over the phone.

200
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,941
You should bring him in.

201
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,193
You think?

202
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,280
Yes, I threatened my wife.
I threatened to leave her.

203
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:18,659
That stupid aquarium was her entire life.
She paid zero attention to anything else.

204
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,743
Including you?

205
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,413
Me, our children, our dogs, housework.

206
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,790
She couldn't even keep up
with her Fitbit challenges.

207
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,792
The night she died, you know where I was?

208
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:30,963
Home. Taking care
of our two sick kids, by myself.

209
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,925
- So you're giving us your alibi?
- I watch cop shows. I know how this works.

210
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:38,346
You'll find plenty of footage of me
covered in kid vomit on our nanny cam.

211
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,806
Bruna's employees
heard you screaming over the phone.

212
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,642
Was that also
about her never being around?

213
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,561
That was mostly about the affair.

214
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,982
She was making late night calls
to some restaurant owner named Jeremy.

215
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,527
I followed her to his house,
but all they did was argue.

216
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,988
Turns out it wasn't an affair.

217
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,241
It was just about her fish.

218
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,535
[chuckles] Even that was about work.

219
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,913
Part of me hoped she was cheating on me,

220
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,124
just to prove that her aquarium
wasn't her entire universe.

221
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,501
Her universe?

222
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:14,882
Would you say
she was sort of the god of the aquarium?

223
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:15,965
Sure.

224
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:20,262
A god who didn't have time
for the one who loved her the most.

225
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,346
Me.

226
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,435
Lucifer, are you hearing this?

227
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,271
His godlike wife
didn't have time for him.

228
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,649
- God, you say?
- Mm-hmm.

229
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:36,028
[gasps] Which one
of these retirement homes

230
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,615
do you think that your godlike wife
would enjoy the most?

231
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,368
Uh, Golden Oldies has the best salad bar,

232
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,787
but you can't beat
Big Sleep's water aerobics.

233
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,205
Retirement? What are you...

234
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,499
Bruna is dead.

235
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,502
Right.

236
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,130
Right, well, if you were God,

237
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,966
which one do you think
you'd like to spend your eternity in?

238
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,135
I wouldn't.

239
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,054
[sniffles] Not without my wife by my side.

240
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,848
Well, that doesn't help me at all.

241
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,600
My dad's wife is in another dimension.

242
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,269
I'm so sorry.

243
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:12,440
But maybe Dad could do with a new partner.

244
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:16,152
Well, that's it. Forget retirement homes.
You've given me a much better idea.

245
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,905
Excuse me, what about the case?
You haven't even been listening.

246
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,407
Yes, I was.

247
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,745
Aquarium, Fitbit, kid vomit,
restaurant owner named Jeremy.

248
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,329
- [grumbles]
- Wait.

249
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,207
It's not Jeremy
of Jeremy's Fine Food, is it?

250
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:37,381
Oh. Detective,
Jeremy is known in certain circles

251
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,176
for serving rare, illegal animals.

252
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,845
The aquarium's missing fish.

253
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,765
If Bruna found out someone
was selling the fish to Jeremy

254
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:49,059
and confronted him about it,
that's definitely motive for murder.

255
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,143
[scoffs]

256
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:51,854
Hmm?

257
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,564
[groans]

258
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,486
Having a soul is the worst.

259
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:01,030
- But isn't that what you wanted?
- Yeah, until I got one.

260
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,490
Got Eve and...

261
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,702
turns out having
a soul mate that can die...

262
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,288
It's torture.

263
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:16,504
There's also something very special about
the limited time we have with someone.

264
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,048
Maybe you could focus on what you do have

265
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,467
instead of what you don't.

266
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,635
[scoffs]

267
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,347
Not when I know
Eve will end up in Heaven.

268
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,225
Where I can never go.

269
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,062
You don't know that
she's gonna end up in Heaven.

270
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:38,943
She's the brightest, nicest,
most caring, honest person ever.

271
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,653
Of course she's going to Heaven.

272
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,572
Now that you have a new soul,
maybe you'll go too.

273
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,534
With all the terrible things I've done,
Linda? Come on.

274
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,870
Definitely going to Hell.

275
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:54,458
But wasn't there a time that
all you wanted was to go back there?

276
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,461
Yeah, as Hell's torturer.

277
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,465
But with a soul, if I die,

278
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,592
I'll turn up as one of the tortured.

279
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:04,844
[exhales]

280
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,054
Oh, God.

281
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,353
I know how they're gonna torture me.

282
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,148
I've gotta go fix this.

283
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:24,405
<i>♪ If you only knew
How much I loved you ♪</i>

284
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:29,159
♪ <i>The sky would open up
And show from Heaven above... ♪</i>

285
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,035
Detective!

286
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,790
Lucifer. You look handsome.

287
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,375
You look good enough to eat.

288
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,376
[laughs]

289
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:41,797
Um, why are we at Jeremy's
right now, dressed like this?

290
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,674
Weren't we gonna confront him tomorrow?

291
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:47,720
Why put off till tomorrow what we
can do tonight whilst drinking wine?

292
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:51,348
Besides, if we confront him head-on,
he'll surely deny, deny, deny.

293
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:56,645
But if we get him to sell us one of
his deliciously illegal meats, then voila!

294
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,272
[in French accent] <i>Leverage.</i>

295
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:01,317
- [normal accent] Leverage.
- So like a sting-date combo.

296
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:05,195
You know, that's a <i>nice</i>
work-life balance, Lucifer.

297
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,324
Maybe I don't need to be so worried
about you becoming God after all.

298
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,035
- Well, I told you. [chuckles]
- I know.

299
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,456
It'll be nice to have some alone time,
just the two of us.

300
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,624
[Lucifer] Mm.

301
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:17,707
[God] Son.

302
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,920
- Uh, and your dad.
- [Lucifer exhales]

303
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,379
[woman] Chloe.

304
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,757
And my mom.

305
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,593
Oh, ready for our double Decker date?

306
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,763
[chuckles]

307
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,355
[Lucifer sighs]

308
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,231
- [Chloe, God] Hmm.
- [woman] Oh!

309
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,026
- Good to see you two finally together.
- [Lucifer chuckles]

310
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:48,238
Hmm! On a surprise,
totally without warning, double date.

311
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,408
Oh, you didn't know either?
Well, that explains a lot.

312
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,702
My daughter never invites me to dinner.

313
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,912
[chuckles]

314
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,080
I was blindsided too.

315
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,832
Impossible, Dad, you're omniscient.

316
00:15:58,916 --> 00:15:59,916
Dad?

317
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,672
Well, we haven't been properly introduced.

318
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:05,755
I'm Penelope.

319
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:06,632
I know.

320
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,593
Aww, you know my work.
Well, points already.

321
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,095
And your name is?

322
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,346
You can call me God.

323
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,181
Frey! Godfrey is his name.

324
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,266
Yeah, I thought you two would get along.

325
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,978
Dad is retiring,
and Penelope herself is retired.

326
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,730
- [hesitates] I am not retired.
- [Lucifer] No?

327
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,273
Who told you that? My agent?

328
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:27,736
Oh! Sorry, my mistake.
Well, you have other things in common.

329
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,364
You've both lost spouses.
So, there's that.

330
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,657
Your wife died?

331
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,742
No, she's just in her own universe.

332
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,496
Isn't that just
how relationships fall apart?

333
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,915
My John and I, we were the opposite.

334
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,667
We were totally connected.

335
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:46,839
- Totally supportive of each other.
- Hmm.

336
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,507
What? You don't agree?

337
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,635
[inhales] Well, he was...

338
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,847
completely supportive of <i>you.</i>

339
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:59,685
He gave up his dream of becoming
a detective to support <i>your</i> career.

340
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,478
And you're saying that's my fault?

341
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,231
Children. They blame us for everything.

342
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,068
Right? As if we created the world.

343
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,112
[laughing]

344
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,366
So...

345
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:16,827
tell me, Godfrey.

346
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,538
How long have you been this handsome?

347
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:20,831
Hmm.

348
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,295
[barking]

349
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,007
[panting] All right.

350
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,635
[shushing]

351
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:37,890
One, two, three.

352
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,059
[door opens]

353
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,936
Maze! Maze, what are you doing?

354
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,272
[sighs] Nothing.

355
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,359
I can't do it.

356
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,611
Can't do what?

357
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,822
[sighs] Something I'll feel guilty about.

358
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,699
[sighs] Why, Maze?

359
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,534
[sighs]

360
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:01,705
Because that'll be what Squee
tortures me with in Hell, okay?

361
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,125
I know what my Hell loop is going to be.

362
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,546
I was trying to change it.

363
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,715
So you'd rather be a puppy murderer?

364
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:16,178
I'm going to be trapped
in that hospital room, Amenadiel.

365
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,639
Breaking Eve's heart.

366
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:22,643
Losing her over and over and over.

367
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,020
Forever.

368
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:28,982
Maybe not, Maze.

369
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,068
[shudders]

370
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:34,488
When Lucifer becomes God,
you can just ask him for help.

371
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,907
Hold on. Lucifer's doing what?

372
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,034
He's taking over after our father retires.

373
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,955
I'm sure it's gonna be no problem for him
to change the rules of Hell for you.

374
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:46,250
You got this, right?

375
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,459
- What?
- Yep, okay.

376
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:51,046
No. No, no, no, no, no.
Maze, what are you doing?

377
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,383
- Maze! Don't... [groans]
- [urinating]

378
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,557
My little rebel
made such a mess in that garden.

379
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,643
[Penelope and God laugh]

380
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:08,730
Chloe's most difficult phase
were her Goth years.

381
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,275
[chuckling] Hot Topic
almost bankrupted us.

382
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,901
- [God chuckles]
- Okay.

383
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,530
Enough with the childhood
embarrassing stories, thank you.

384
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,866
Godfrey, why don't you
tell us about your old job?

385
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:22,411
What kind of work-life balance
did you have?

386
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,045
I actually didn't have much of a life.

387
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,173
It was pretty much all work.

388
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,757
I'm sure he's exaggerating.

389
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:40,012
Caused a lot of problems
between me and my wife.

390
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,724
She always felt like
I didn't have enough time for her.

391
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,936
Maybe she was right.

392
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,692
- Oh.
- Ready to order entrees?

393
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,194
- I'm not hungry.
- I'm vegan.

394
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:58,280
- What? Since when?
- Okay, I'll order for the table.

395
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,199
[waiter] Would you
like to hear our specials?

396
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,867
Well, actually, um...

397
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,829
[whispers] I'm interested
in your special specials.

398
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,332
I'm in the mood for some Asian arowana.

399
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,335
Sir, we don't serve
endangered animals here.

400
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,045
That's not what I heard.

401
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,047
I'd like to speak with the owner, please.

402
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,007
Sorry, sir, you have the wrong idea.

403
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,261
Well, I think we just blew our shot.

404
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,889
Oh, merely a slight snag.

405
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,850
Anyway, let's concentrate
on what's important here.

406
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,186
Your mom and my dad.
A match made in Heaven.

407
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,230
Excuse me.
Jeremy Morgan, I'm the owner.

408
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:34,274
And I want to apologize
for our waiter's behavior.

409
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,735
He had no idea
we had such an important guest.

410
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,111
That's quite all right.

411
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,405
Miss Decker, I'm a a huge fan.

412
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:44,201
[chuckles] <i>Althea: Queen of the Quarks,</i>
that should have won you an Oscar.

413
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,328
[laughs] Oh, my!

414
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:50,040
Well, thank you. And I totally agree.

415
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,203
[Jeremy] It is an honor
to have you in my restaurant.

416
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,629
Now, we don't normally serve
first-timers from our secret menu,

417
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,923
and sadly, we don't have any arowana,

418
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,676
but I do have a delicacy fit for a queen.

419
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,802
Oh.

420
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:05,264
[Jeremy] Ailuropoda melanoleuca tartare.

421
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,225
Ooh, sounds so European.

422
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,770
- [God] You said you were vegan, right?
- Mm-hmm.

423
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,063
You sure you wanna eat panda?

424
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,231
Panda?

425
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,191
Jeremy Morgan, you're under arrest.

426
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:20,320
And I'm sure PETA will agree,
most likely going to Hell.

427
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:26,159
Yesterday, on my morning run,

428
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:29,788
I saw this guy about to cross the street,

429
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,083
head in his phone, not paying attention,

430
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,295
moments away from walking into traffic.

431
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:43,260
And my mind
started picturing things. Like...

432
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,472
like, really vivid things.

433
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,394
Which car would hit him first?

434
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:56,106
Which of his bones would shatter?

435
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,985
The position his body
would land on the ground.

436
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,365
Exactly how long
it would take him to bleed out.

437
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,703
Detail after detail.

438
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,958
I eventually snapped out of it, but...

439
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:16,793
it was too late.

440
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:17,794
He got hit?

441
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:18,712
No.

442
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,672
No, he... He looked up in time.

443
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,799
- But that, that's not the point.
- [sighs]

444
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:27,971
The point is that helping him
wasn't my first thought.

445
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,098
[voce breaking] Or my second.

446
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,850
Or my third.

447
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,020
[crying] How messed up is that?

448
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:36,771
Ella.

449
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,735
You've been coming to see me
ever since you caught Pete.

450
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:46,865
And over all that time,
you've never taken a single day off.

451
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,494
Maybe it's catching up to you.

452
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:53,497
No, no, no, no,
the job is what centers me.

453
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:57,292
Channels these thoughts
into some kind of purpose.

454
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,007
The truth is...

455
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,345
I've been this way my entire life.

456
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,890
I've hidden it from everyone.

457
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,142
[inhales]

458
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,269
Dan, Chloe.

459
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:20,357
Everyone thinks I'm a good person.

460
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:24,236
I told Amenadiel that
I would try to accept myself, but...

461
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,278
how?

462
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,744
How can I accept myself when
this darkness is such a part of who I am?

463
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,549
[sighs] Why haven't I heard anything yet?

464
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:48,176
- [clears throat] Lucifer.
- I gave my Dad a phone.

465
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,887
The least he can do
is text me how it went.

466
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:54,266
As I was saying, we found
your freezer full of illegal meats.

467
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:57,644
Bruna found out. She was gonna
expose you, so you killed her.

468
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:00,730
I had nothing to do
with Bruna's death. I swear.

469
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,400
- Yes, I serve exotic meats.
- [phone whooshes]

470
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,861
Any idea how hard it is
to run a restaurant in LA?

471
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,321
You have to innovate
just to stay in business.

472
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,240
The savage isn't lying about that.

473
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,325
- Oh, so you <i>are</i> with us?
- [phone chiming]

474
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,577
Sorry.

475
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,163
So, Bruna wasn't aware
of what you were up to?

476
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,915
No, she was,
but she wasn't trying to stop me.

477
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,792
She was trying to sell some of her fish.

478
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:24,045
Marine conservationist Bruna,
whose whole life was that aquarium?

479
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,714
I don't know about any of that.

480
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:29,843
All I know is she approached me months ago
and offered to sell me some bluefin tuna.

481
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:33,763
It's hard to come by, so I bought some.
I have the wire transfers to prove it.

482
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,224
If you were in business,
what were you arguing about?

483
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,935
A week ago,
she offered me her rarest fish.

484
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,354
She said
she needed to sell $47,000 worth,

485
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,732
but I'd just maxed out on my budget on...

486
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:47,027
[sighs] <i>...</i>bald eagle.

487
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,653
So I turned her down.

488
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:53,033
She freaked out and left, and that's
the last time I had any contact with her.

489
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:56,262
- Where were you the night of the murder?
- My restaurant. My employees can verify.

490
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,763
- [chiming]
- [Lucifer] For Dad's sake.

491
00:24:57,787 --> 00:25:01,041
I know he has big fingers,
but these texts are simply indecipherable.

492
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:05,086
I'm just gonna call him.
Excuse me, Detective. Wolfgang Yuck.

493
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,425
We're gonna need those wire transfers.

494
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,096
[cell phone ringing]

495
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:21,311
[Lucifer] Oh, come on,
just answer the bloody phone.

496
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:26,358
Oh, there you are. So?

497
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:31,404
How'd it go? Ready to ride off
into the sunset with a Decker of your own?

498
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,032
Penelope is lovely.

499
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,245
But she's a few millennia
too young for me.

500
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:43,291
Right. Okay. No double Decker. [chuckles]

501
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,253
Well, there's plenty more fish in the sea.

502
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,922
I'll find you a match
if it's the last non-God thing I do.

503
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,967
Lucifer, you're not listening.

504
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:57,097
There is and will always be
only one woman I will ever love.

505
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,851
Fine. Well,
if you're gonna be stubborn about it,

506
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:04,646
I'll plan a different element
of your retirement, then.

507
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,022
Son.

508
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,109
I don't need your help.

509
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:11,444
I need to make sure
that everything's ready.

510
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,237
Unless...

511
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,449
Unless, of course, you just want
to name your successor now.

512
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:20,120
Perhaps someone who's passionate about
making plans, if you know what I mean?

513
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,289
You mean someone
who's trying to get rid of me.

514
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:27,502
I am trying to make your transition
as smooth as possible, Dad.

515
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,755
Get everything moving
so you can just give me the...

516
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,634
give me the throne. [sighs]

517
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,763
Everything in its time, son.

518
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:40,973
For now...

519
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,562
I don't wanna hear you speak
a word of my retirement again.

520
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,399
Eh. Heard and understood.

521
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:52,861
You won't hear another word about
your retirement come out of these lips.

522
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:07,833
Hole in one.

523
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,630
- Again.
- [chuckles]

524
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,258
- This is fun.
- Huh.

525
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,344
But I know why we're really here.

526
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:20,180
Lucifer asked you
to talk to me about my retirement.

527
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,263
He's delegating.

528
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,851
One of the many requirements
of your job, right?

529
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,231
And you're sure
you want Lucifer to take my place?

530
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,319
Believe me, Dad, I...

531
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,447
have my reservations, but...

532
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,493
Lucifer's come a long way.

533
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:45,080
And he does his best
when you put a little faith in him.

534
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,208
Huh.

535
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,378
So how many of these games
do you want me to win

536
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:54,255
before we visit
Lucifer's retirement homes?

537
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,341
[both laugh]

538
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,593
I'm glad you're back, Dad.

539
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:02,055
I'm really enjoying
spending this kind of time with you.

540
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:03,138
Me too, son.

541
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,935
[chuckles]
But something's been bothering me.

542
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:10,605
- I mean, you're playing the perfect game.
- Should I take it easy on you?

543
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,191
No, no, that's not it.
That's not it. It's just...

544
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:14,817
I don't know.

545
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,530
It doesn't seem
to me like you're losing it.

546
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,157
It is strange, isn't it?

547
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,158
I feel fine.

548
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,244
When's the first time
you noticed a problem?

549
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,957
I didn't. Michael did.

550
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:30,709
A few months back.

551
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:32,793
Michael noticed?

552
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:37,465
And did you feel like you were
losing control of your powers then?

553
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:42,804
[exhales] Not right away,
but the more we talked about it,

554
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,431
the more I realized I was.

555
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,687
You know we angels self-actualize, right?

556
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,565
Dad, what if you self-actualize too?

557
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,900
What if you're doing this to yourself?

558
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,529
Oh!

559
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:03,783
Amenadiel says Dad didn't want
to see any of the rest homes I picked.

560
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,160
- Huh.
- [sighs]

561
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:09,164
Do you think maybe
he's reconsidering retiring, maybe?

562
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,751
You don't want me to be God, do you?

563
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,545
Lucifer, this whole case,
you know, your mind has...

564
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:17,464
been elsewhere.

565
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:21,676
And I just wonder if
when you're actually ruling the universe,

566
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,219
you don't have time for us.

567
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:27,223
Just like your dad said that
he didn't have time for your mom.

568
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,977
Detective, I have told you,
I'm going to do things differently.

569
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:35,732
[chuckles] Said every child
of every parent ever.

570
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:39,152
Guys, so I checked
Bruna's secret wire account,

571
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:40,779
and it confirms Jeremy's story.

572
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,655
She was totally
receiving deposits from him.

573
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,800
- So she was selling her fish.
- [Ella] That's not all.

574
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:49,370
A few days before she was murdered,
she received a mondo transfer for $47,000.

575
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,998
The exact same amount
that Bruna told Jeremy she needed.

576
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,167
Mm-hmm.
Now, I don't know who sent the payment,

577
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:58,880
but I was able to track the routing info
to an IP registered to this address.

578
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,804
[grunting]

579
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,730
Huh! That sushi they're eating
could be Bruna's fish.

580
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,023
Recognize anyone?

581
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:20,610
Oh! Yakuza tattoos.

582
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,737
[grunting]

583
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:31,037
- Wonderful. Who do you think's in charge?
- My guess. The impressive chap in red.

584
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,372
I'll get us an audience.

585
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:33,873
But we have a warrant.

586
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,500
Well, respect will get us further.

587
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:39,295
And the quickest way to earn that
is to display superior skills in battle.

588
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,922
Battle? Lucifer, no.

589
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,299
Relax, Detective,
I'm invulnerable, remember?

590
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,802
Besides, my dad has been
driving me up the wall.

591
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,512
I need to blow off some steam.

592
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,098
Lucifer...

593
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,809
[men murmuring]

594
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,812
Fancy another go?

595
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:57,981
- [laughing]
- Oh?

596
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,817
Very well, I'll go first.

597
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,985
[snarls]

598
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,741
Hai! [man grunting]

599
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,244
[grunts]

600
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,416
- [grunts]
- [men laughing]

601
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,212
- [speaks Japanese]
- [man chuckles] Oh!

602
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,220
[gasps]

603
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,016
[growls]

604
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:36,227
Well, this doesn't seem
like a very fair fight.

605
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,187
Let's even things up, shall we?

606
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,485
[grunting]

607
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,331
[chuckling]

608
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,627
[thuds]

609
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:05,924
Yummy.

610
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,676
- Who knows what that is?
- Good point.

611
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,095
[chuckles] Okay,
that's not Bruna's endangered fish.

612
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,056
I only bought her good <i>legal</i> stuff.

613
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,099
$47,000 worth?

614
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:18,895
No. That was purely a donation I made
'cause she was an honorable woman.

615
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:23,024
What's so honorable about making
a profit selling endangered animals?

616
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,193
She wasn't keeping the money for herself.

617
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,738
She was putting the money back
into the aquarium to save the fish.

618
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:32,867
The place was in dire straits. Without
the 47K, the aquarium would go under.

619
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,870
So she was sacrificing
a few fish to save the many?

620
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:36,788
[man] Hmm.

621
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,831
Did anyone else know what Bruna was doing?

622
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:41,542
A woman called from the aquarium
asking about the donation,

623
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,461
implying it was for some missing fish.

624
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:45,546
She sounded angry.
I didn't catch her name.

625
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,630
Huh.

626
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,676
- Oh, thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

627
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,761
- [man exhales]
- See? Easy.

628
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:55,181
Yes, but which female employee
would have motive to kill Bruna?

629
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:56,766
Well, who would be more angry

630
00:32:56,849 --> 00:33:00,770
about the aquarium being used as
a seafood bar than our old friend Lizzie?

631
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:02,271
The woman who actually owns it?

632
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,774
Exactly.

633
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:08,236
- But we have no evidence to prove it.
- [sighs]

634
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:17,662
So, what was it
you wanted to see me about?

635
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,295
Well, don't you wanna keep it?

636
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,923
Eve doesn't want it,
so it's useless to me.

637
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:35,972
[sighs] Maze, I am sorry
that I didn't tell you about your mother.

638
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,683
I wanted to.

639
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,311
I don't know,
maybe I shouldn't have kept my promise.

640
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,564
It's okay. Lucifer, I get it.

641
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:48,609
You were just trying to protect me
from having to face how...

642
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,571
little I meant to her.

643
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:55,866
Yeah.

644
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,662
So I hear you're going to be God.

645
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,623
If all goes well.
Do you wanna talk me out of it?

646
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,750
No.

647
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:05,793
I want you to be God,

648
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,713
so you can change
one of the rules of Hell for me.

649
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:12,175
Ah, yes, Amenadiel told me
you want me to change your Hell loop.

650
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,258
No.

651
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,805
I want you to change
who can sit on the throne.

652
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:21,184
But Father said
Hell no longer needed a warden.

653
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,855
But maybe it deserves one.

654
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,024
You?

655
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,403
Is that what you really want?

656
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,949
I can't stay here, Lucifer.

657
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:41,788
And I want to control
who does the torturing.

658
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:45,707
[exhales]

659
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,046
Well.

660
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:54,217
I can't think of anyone
I would trust more with our old home.

661
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,680
To Mazikeen.

662
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:01,723
Queen of Hell.

663
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:07,188
I was thinking Maziqueen. But whatever.

664
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:08,773
[chuckles]

665
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,108
[glasses clink]

666
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,570
- [typing]
- [sighs]

667
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:22,829
- Daddy Morningstar! Hey.
- [chuckles]

668
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,249
Oh, if you're looking for your son, he...

669
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,627
You know what I just realized?

670
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,547
If you're Lucifer's dad,

671
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:36,134
that would make you God. Right?

672
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,885
Hmm. That would, wouldn't it?

673
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,680
I really wish you were.

674
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:43,933
'Cause I am grasping
at straws in our latest case.

675
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:47,562
And it would be so much easier
if you'd just, you know... [clucks]

676
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:51,065
wink, wink, just tell me
how to catch our killer.

677
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,733
I can't tell you that.

678
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,068
[Ella groans]

679
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,321
But I can tell
you're struggling with something.

680
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,827
Is there anything I can do to help?

681
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,624
Not unless you can
smite the darkness out of me.

682
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,460
Everyone has darkness in them.

683
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:15,256
It's not about getting rid of it.
It's about accepting it.

684
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,970
Yeah, but mine's...

685
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,222
mine's different.

686
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,057
Deeper.

687
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,394
It attracts me to bad people.

688
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,396
I think...

689
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:36,068
I think maybe<i> I'm</i> a bad person.

690
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,361
My child.

691
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,282
The darker the darkness,

692
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:43,534
the brighter the light.

693
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,704
And you, Miss Lopez,

694
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:50,791
shine so very, very brightly.

695
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,086
I can see it all the way from Heaven.

696
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,255
[exhales]

697
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:01,302
- [computer beeps]
- Oh, uh, those are the results!

698
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,181
Oh, my gosh.

699
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,018
My hunch paid off. My...

700
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:20,987
Uh... [clears throat]

701
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,408
So, God is retiring.

702
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,786
And Lucifer's taking his place.

703
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:28,495
Hmm.

704
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,831
Makes an odd amount of sense.

705
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,875
Really? That's your reaction?

706
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:36,921
Well, Lucifer is surprisingly great
at big picture kind of stuff.

707
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:39,632
I mean, he did just pull off
a pretty elaborate prank

708
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:42,969
that made me think... [chuckles]
I got a bunch of people killed. So...

709
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,762
I'm sorry. Lucifer did what?

710
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:45,972
D-Doesn't matter.

711
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:50,101
The... the point is, it was
a pretty transformative experience for me.

712
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,560
In a good way.

713
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:55,106
So, if Lucifer is God,
I can think of crazier things.

714
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:56,189
Wow.

715
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,485
Did not think
I would ever hear that from you.

716
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:04,532
But, um... [clears throat]
that's not what I'm concerned about.

717
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,577
What are you worried about then?

718
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:13,207
That he won't be able to balance
being the ruler of the universe

719
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,459
with being my boyfriend.

720
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,045
Which, when I say out loud,
sounds selfish...

721
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,213
No. Mnh-mnh.

722
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,423
- Yeah.
- I get it.

723
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:21,506
It's a lot.

724
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:26,095
But if it's any comfort,
Lucifer's crazy about you.

725
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,263
And you know that.

726
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,723
And you're crazy about him.

727
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,892
So I think you should just trust that
whatever challenges life throws at you,

728
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,060
you're gonna figure it out.

729
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,356
Prepare to be impressed.

730
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,609
So you guys remember how we couldn't
find the victim's missing arm, right?

731
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:43,070
So based on her husband
saying that she had a Fitbit,

732
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:48,534
I was able to track its serial number,
ping its location and boom, found it!

733
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,329
[Dan] Huh.

734
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:54,332
It's still at the aquarium, you guys.

735
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,584
Doing figure eights in one of the tanks.

736
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,086
So it's inside of a shark?

737
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,087
Bingo!

738
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,006
Now sharks swallow their meals whole,

739
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:05,634
so if there's any sort of evidence
on that arm, it might still be there.

740
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:08,846
Yeah, but the hand that we already have
didn't produce any identifiable DNA,

741
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:12,016
so with water and stomach acid,

742
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,143
the chances are
even slimmer with this arm.

743
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:18,064
Right. But the killer doesn't know that.

744
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,527
[man] Uh, I don't know about this.

745
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,947
It's just a fish.
If I could move it on my own, I would.

746
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:30,534
You're asking us to move a shark.
I'm sorry, lady, but we gotta go.

747
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,954
- Come on.
- [Chloe] You, uh, moving something?

748
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,665
[chuckles] Detective!

749
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:40,920
This, uh...
this shark's grown too large for his tank.

750
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:43,297
I'm transporting him
to the marina to set him free.

751
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,759
Just two hours after I told you
it's digesting a piece of evidence.

752
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:50,429
Hmm. I couldn't imagine a more
suspicious time to suddenly free Willy.

753
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,890
The shark's name is Andrew.

754
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:55,393
And I'm sorry,
but unless you have a warrant,

755
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:58,813
then whatever's in Andrew's stomach
has to stay there while I release him.

756
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:02,108
That's funny because I thought
you were a hands-off kind of boss.

757
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:04,610
Not when it comes
to covering up her crimes, it seems.

758
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,028
Oh, and we do have a warrant.

759
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,072
Our search team is
in your office right now.

760
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,825
Plus, I'm sure we'll find
your DNA on Bruna's arm.

761
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:14,703
So I would say
you are dead in the water, Lizzie.

762
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,581
[hesitates]

763
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,750
I was... I was too hands-off.

764
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:25,881
I... I found out too late
that Bruna was playing God,

765
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:29,718
choosing which fish would live
and which ones would die.

766
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,638
None of these beautiful creatures
deserve that.

767
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:35,558
Sounds to me like
Bruna wasn't the only one playing God.

768
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,476
Did you enjoy smiting her?

769
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,062
I didn't mean to kill her.

770
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,982
I... I confronted her about...
about what she was doing,

771
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,775
and she... she threw it in my face.

772
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:49,280
She said that she'd been telling me
about our financial issues for years.

773
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:52,658
You know, things got heated, and I...

774
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:56,495
I lost control.

775
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:00,291
I didn't even know I had the letter opener
in my hand until I stabbed her with it.

776
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,003
If I had just listened to her...

777
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,465
given her what she needed
when she told me,

778
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:10,843
then none of this
would have ever happened.

779
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:15,764
Well, Elizabeth Newman, you're under
arrest for the murder of Bruna Lorenzoni.

780
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,100
[mutters]

781
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,186
[handcuffs click]

782
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,815
Lucifer, you okay?

783
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:27,568
No, I...

784
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,905
Something our killer said
just made me realize something.

785
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,992
I don't think I've been listening at all

786
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:38,537
to what my father
truly wants for his retirement.

787
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,374
Would you excuse me?

788
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,002
There's something I need to do.

789
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,727
[sighs]

790
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:06,941
Hey, Gabriel. You got a minute?

791
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,742
Oh, come on, I know you're listening.
You always are.

792
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,411
[wings flap]

793
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:26,418
What can I say?

794
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,337
It's one of my God-given talents.

795
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,547
Indeed.

796
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:34,051
But right now I am interested
in one of your<i> other </i>talents.

797
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:37,136
I, uh...

798
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,890
I need you to do me a favor.

799
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,648
[knock on door]

800
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:51,944
[Chloe] Mom!

801
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:54,405
Hi. What are you doing here?

802
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,324
I brought Trixie a chocolate cake.

803
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,367
Oh.

804
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:02,871
How thoughtful.

805
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:06,667
She won't be here until later,
but thank you.

806
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,302
Mom, are you okay?

807
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,721
It's what you said at dinner.

808
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:23,183
I mean, do you really think
I'd make your father give up his dreams?

809
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:29,648
Well, I don't know
if you made him, but he did.

810
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:33,819
Oh, darling.

811
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:37,906
You always think you know everything.

812
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,242
Your father and I had a deal.

813
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,785
We would take turns.

814
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:46,915
He'd hold off on becoming a detective
until I got my acting career going.

815
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,544
And then after a few years,
we would switch.

816
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,172
[hesitates] But when it came time...

817
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,384
for his turn, he, um...

818
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:01,888
He died.

819
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:09,355
[voice cracks] I wanted to see
your father become a detective so badly.

820
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,193
I'm sorry, Mom.

821
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:23,702
I just need you to know that I loved
your father from the bottom of my heart.

822
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:29,667
And I'd give anything to have another
chance at being the supporting partner.

823
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,629
Okay, Mom. [sniffles]

824
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,171
I hear you.

825
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,723
[sniffles] You wanna stay for dinner?

826
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:49,978
- We have dessert.
- [laughs, sniffles]

827
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:00,154
Lucifer!

828
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:03,450
- [chuckles]
- Why'd you call us here, brother?

829
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:07,287
Well, after finally listening to what
Dad's been telling me all along,

830
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:11,667
I realized there's only one thing that's
gonna make his retirement fulfilling.

831
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,837
So, I enlisted Gabriel's help
to make it happen.

832
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:18,632
Did you know our sister can
deliver a message anywhere?

833
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,259
And I mean...

834
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,427
anywhere.

835
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,402
Mom?

836
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,697
Hello, my sweet boy.

837
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:47,411
Husband.

838
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,245
Wife.

839
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:53,584
Lucifer, how?

840
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:57,755
Well, it wasn't easy. Mom says she only
has enough juice for this one time.

841
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,840
I never thought I'd see you again.

842
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,551
I never thought I'd see you retire.

843
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:05,929
Hmm. Well, like I've always said,

844
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:07,639
it's a tough gig.

845
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,268
But you understand that
now that you're doing it.

846
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:16,398
I don't find it nearly as difficult
as you made it out to be.

847
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:17,941
[chuckles]

848
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:24,156
Then clearly
you're better at it than I ever was.

849
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,034
No surprise in that.

850
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:31,830
Well, I must admit, though...

851
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,753
it does get lonely at the top.

852
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:42,216
Lucifer,
you don't have to become God anymore.

853
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:45,844
I found out Dad's not losing his powers.
Michael's been gaslighting him.

854
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:48,013
It's all been inside of his head.

855
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:52,851
Michael? [scoffs] Well, he won't get away
with that sorta thing when I'm in charge.

856
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:56,522
Brother, do you hear what I'm saying?
Dad's fine. He can keep being God.

857
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:58,273
Everything can go back to normal.

858
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,234
Everything.

859
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,279
We can be a family again.

860
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:06,865
[chuckles] Wonderful,

861
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:11,119
except for the part where I don't get
to become God and prove that I'm worthy.

862
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:13,789
[hesitates] Just, I'll deal with this.

863
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:18,252
So looks like my plans
for Dad's retirement

864
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:20,629
have got off
to a smashing start. [chuckles]

865
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:22,673
What's it gonna be, hmm?

866
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:25,300
Good old Florida?
Back up to the Silver City?

867
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,595
Actually, we have decided...

868
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:33,141
we're moving to my universe.

869
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,519
What?

870
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:39,523
But you're both here.

871
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,984
- Together.
- [Lucifer] Yeah.

872
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:45,153
You're just gonna leave us again?

873
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:49,408
Without any ability to come back?

874
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:55,038
Your mother spent a long time in my world.

875
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:01,544
It's my turn...

876
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,591
to spend time in hers.

877
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:11,680
[sighs] Dad, a... a word, please.

878
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:28,530
I can't believe I'm saying this, but...

879
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,700
now that we know you're not losing it,

880
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:35,746
there's no need for you to retire.
You can just keep on being God.

881
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,999
I thought you wanted to be God.

882
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:42,252
Well, I did. I... I do. [hesitates]

883
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:45,464
But you've only just got here.

884
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:47,673
Can't you...

885
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,719
stay and annoy me for a bit longer?

886
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,642
Nothing lasts forever, son.

887
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:00,938
[huffs]

888
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:03,774
I am so...

889
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:09,571
so sorry I didn't get
to say goodbye last time.

890
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:13,825
- No, I never blamed you, Mom.
- No. [chuckles]

891
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,327
Of course you didn't.

892
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:19,414
My kindest, wisest, most perfect son.

893
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:22,000
And now the perfect dad.

894
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,460
I'm far from it.

895
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:25,086
But...

896
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,506
I'm trying my best.

897
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:34,429
That's what <i>makes</i> you perfect.

898
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:39,977
So that's it?
I've got no choice in the matter?

899
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,437
I've given you a life of choice.

900
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:45,482
This one's mine.

901
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,192
[sighs]

902
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,780
Lucifer.

903
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,200
At our family dinner...

904
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:57,661
you were right.

905
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:03,709
[inhales] I could
have been a better father to you.

906
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:09,548
[chuckles] Well,
now you forego your mysterious ways.

907
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,591
Just as you're leaving?

908
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,469
No need for them anymore
now that I'm retiring.

909
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,097
Which means...

910
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:19,057
[Lucifer sighs]

911
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:22,978
<i>...</i>I can say something
I've wanted to for a long time.

912
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,525
I love you, son.

913
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,321
[sighs deeply]

914
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:36,950
And I am very proud
of the man you've become.

915
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:43,915
[Lucifer sobbing]

916
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:55,010
I think Amenadiel
might like to hear that too.

917
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:56,720
- [God laughs]
- [panting]

918
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:00,307
I already told him.

919
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,771
It was an emotional round of golf.

920
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:07,939
[chuckles]

921
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:15,447
Time to go. My universe needs me.

922
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,661
- [Lucifer] Oh.
- [sighs]

923
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:24,414
Thank you, son.

924
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,426
[God sighs]

925
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,262
Dad, wait.

926
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,391
You forgot to name your successor.

927
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,061
It's not up to me anymore.

928
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:48,688
You'll figure it out.

929
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:52,692
Back to your mysterious ways already.

930
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,820
All part of my plan.

931
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,074
Plan.

932
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,998
How much of this was your plan?

933
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,417
[chuckles]

934
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:14,881
Goodbye, my loves.

935
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:22,764
[Lucifer sighs]

936
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:44,995
[sighs]

937
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,960
- Hi.
- [exhales]

938
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:53,962
I'm glad you called.

939
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:56,173
How are you holding up?

940
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:59,259
Oh, nothing lasts forever, I suppose.

941
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:01,803
[huffs]

942
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,184
I decided something.

943
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:09,769
I'm quitting the LAPD.

944
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:14,523
Sorry.

945
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:18,570
Sorry, I thought I heard you say
you were quitting the LAPD.

946
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:20,779
Yeah.

947
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:28,538
I became a cop so that
I could do good and help people.

948
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:34,878
And as God, you'll have
the power to help, well, everyone.

949
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:37,839
So if I can help you become God...

950
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:42,802
then I'll be helping everyone as well.

951
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,474
[hesitates] Are you sure?

952
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:53,939
I mean, how can I call you "the Detective"
if you're not actually a detective?

953
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:55,649
[chuckles]

954
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:57,983
Lucifer...

955
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:03,156
you've been helping me
do my job for the last five years.

956
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:06,201
Now it's my turn to support you.

957
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:09,663
That's what partners do, right?

958
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:11,497
[gasps]

959
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:13,582
[chuckles]

960
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:16,419
I'll take that as a yes.

961
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:19,464
[Lucifer sighs]

962
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,345
- [wings flap]
- [Remiel] Lucifer!

963
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:29,015
Where is Father?

964
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,559
Uh, excuse <i>us, </i>we were having a moment.

965
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:32,769
Where is he?

966
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:35,939
Gone. Retired. Eternally unavailable.

967
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:37,399
Did he name his successor?

968
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:41,319
No, he said it was up to us
to figure it out, but why?

969
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:42,903
Can we talk?

970
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,198
Without the human?

971
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:49,160
No. Whatever you want to say to me,
you can say in front of...

972
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,914
my consultant. [chuckles]

973
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:55,374
So be it.

974
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:59,546
Upon returning to the Silver City,
I discovered something alarming.

975
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:02,507
Michael's been gathering support
from the others.

976
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:03,758
Support for what?

977
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:06,344
Michael wants to be God.

978
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:10,432
The sneaky bastard.
I bet this was his plan all along.

979
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:14,019
If it's up to our brothers and sisters,
it looks like he has a good shot,

980
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,102
which is why...

981
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:18,148
and I cannot believe I am saying this...

982
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:25,613
I am backing you, Lucifer.

983
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:28,325
I may not like you,
but I hate Michael even more.

984
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:31,619
Now there's a ringing endorsement
for my campaign poster.

985
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,248
Michael would never suspect
I'd take your side.

986
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:39,044
So, I'll find out what he's up to.

987
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:41,588
[sighs] Whatever it is, it can't be good.

988
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:44,716
And knowing my brother,
he won't be wasting any time.

989
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,934
[animals shriek]

990
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,018
Hello.

991
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,280
- Who's your favorite brother?
- Oh!

992
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,740
Quit it, dork!

993
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:10,784
Gotcha. [chuckles]

994
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,870
I did the favor for Lucifer,
like you asked me to.

995
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:16,790
Gotta say, Mom's universe is pretty cool.

996
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:19,459
The centaurs freak me out, though.

997
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:21,543
And...

998
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:25,548
You get the thing?

999
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,009
I got the thing.

1000
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:31,137
- You wanna see it?
- Uh-huh.

1001
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:34,933
- Careful!
- [clattering]

1002
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,436
This thing can actually kill us.

1003
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,271
Oh, that's right.

1004
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:41,897
My bad.

1005
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:44,317
[sighs]

1006
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,611
[exhales]

1007
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:50,949
Azrael really should have
kept a better eye on her blade.
