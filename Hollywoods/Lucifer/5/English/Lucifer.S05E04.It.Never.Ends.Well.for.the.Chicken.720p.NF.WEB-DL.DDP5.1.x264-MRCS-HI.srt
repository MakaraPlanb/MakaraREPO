00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,331
[both sighing]

182
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,583
So...

183
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,169
Which one of these ne'er-do-wells
shall we interview first?

184
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,881
Same person everyone talks to.

185
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,429
[cash register rings]

186
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,181
Be with you in two shakes.

187
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,435
What's your poison?

188
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,438
Gin? Tequila?

189
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,899
We're, uh, looking for information
on Lily Rose's ring.

190
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,192
You know who nabbed it?

191
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,280
Word on the street...

192
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:18,576
is folks say a newcomer was seen
lurking around Lily's dressing room

193
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,161
the night the ring disappeared.

194
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,414
Sticky-fingered gent
by the name of Lucky Larry.

195
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:24,665
- Oh.
- Oh.

196
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,042
You get a description?

197
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,004
[Lucifer sighs]

198
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,924
Sure, sure. Handsome.

199
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,092
Kind of beefy.

200
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,178
Short-haired, strong jaw.

201
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,222
Usually wears a plain blue suit.

202
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,224
Oh, and an eye patch.

203
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,292
Well, you might have led with that.

204
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,646
All right.

205
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,316
Hey.

206
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,693
See that fella?

207
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,280
That's the face of a rat
just dying to squeal.

208
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,615
You sit tight.

209
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,117
I'm going to go lend him an ear.

210
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,621
Oh! Lovely.

211
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,456
Just what the doctor ordered.

212
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,918
Jack Monroe, PI.

213
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,678
You got any information on a Lucky Larry?

214
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,262
Seen him around.

215
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,517
Handsome, beefy, strong jaw.

216
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,602
- Eye patch?
- That's the guy!

217
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,104
Listen.

218
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,858
I don't want any trouble,
but if you meet me out back in five,

219
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,944
I might be able to get you the skinny.

220
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,403
All right.

221
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,910
[police sirens wailing]

222
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,162
[dogs barking]

223
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,164
Well...

224
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,918
it appears our rat turned tail and ran.

225
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,879
Yeah, he'll show.

226
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,176
So, what'd you want to tell me?

227
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,886
Hey, you should watch your back.

228
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,722
[cackles]

229
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,264
[Jack grunts]

230
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,892
- Ow!
- [Lucifer] You again?

231
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,937
Oh, dear! Are... Are you certain
you don't want me to get involved?

232
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,148
It feels a little unsporting
just standing here.

233
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,400
I take it back.

234
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,569
[woman screams]

235
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,531
[dogs barking]

236
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,700
[suspensful music playing]

237
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,245
[gun cocks]

238
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,540
[cat screeches]

239
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,843
Warmed them up for you, Mr. Stompanato.

240
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,098
Thanks, boys.

241
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,185
Wait, hold it!

242
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,686
Oh, for crying out loud.

243
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,980
I thought you said <i>Mr.</i> Stompanato.

244
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,982
"Mr." is a man.

245
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:58,194
Did you or did you not request
a gender-balanced narrative?

246
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,362
I'm simply following your instructions.

247
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,577
Perhaps you're wondering
why I gathered you here this fine evening.

248
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,286
Thing is...

249
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:12,917
I don't like folks asking questions
in my club.

250
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,045
Sticking noses where they don't belong.

251
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:17,962
So...

252
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,549
if you could refrain...

253
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,719
oh, I would deeply appreciate it.

254
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,388
Because next time...

255
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,643
I won't be so nice.

256
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,896
That means you're gonna die.

257
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,360
[henchmen laughing]

258
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,824
And you...

259
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,036
You're lucky you're a friend of Lily's.

260
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,873
But don't get too friendly.

261
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,629
Enjoy your evening.

262
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,633
Let's go, boys.

263
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,810
Yeah, thanks for having my six back there.

264
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,437
But you told me to stay behind you,

265
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:18,816
which wasn't easy, considering you spent
so much time on the pavement.

266
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,819
So, what now?

267
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,699
Well, we'll check out Lucky Larry's
usual haunts in the morning.

268
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,826
You know,
petty thieves are like bad pennies.

269
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,744
Sooner or later, they always turn up.

270
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,371
Well, then.

271
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:36,333
I am off to trip the light fantastic
with your city's best and brightest.

272
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,417
[chuckles]

273
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,795
I assume you have plans of your own.

274
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,006
What can I say?

275
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,133
Life's one big party.

276
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:48,888
[Lucifer] <i>Little did I know,</i>

277
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,891
<i>Jack and his wife, Shirley,
were going through a rough patch.</i>

278
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,392
[Shirley] How are the potatoes?

279
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,475
[Jack grunts]

280
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,150
I made them with cream,
just like you like.

281
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:07,655
Um...

282
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,325
What happened with your eye?

283
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:13,661
Nothing.

284
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,223
Jack, I know you're still sore with me,

285
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,648
- but you can't just...
- Excuse me.

286
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,376
Lost my appetite.

287
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,713
[door knocks]

288
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:26,008
God forbid a man gets
a moment's peace around here.

289
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,761
[sighs deeply]

290
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,099
[suspensful music plays]

291
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,435
Lucky Larry?

292
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,561
[groans]

293
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,647
[screams]

294
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,070
[suspensful music crescendos]

295
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,911
Give me that name again.

296
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,459
I have to say,
that dress is a lovely color on you.

297
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:04,338
What say we leave the dishes
and take it for a spin at the Copacabana?

298
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,840
Well, that's sweet of you,
Mr. Morningstar, but...

299
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,134
I already have my dance partner.

300
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,260
Oh.

301
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,304
At least, I thought I did.

302
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,306
All right, thanks.

303
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:23,190
If you know what's good for you,
you stay the hell away from my wife.

304
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,553
Well, I didn't think you'd mind,

305
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:27,069
considering you haven't said
two words to her since I arrived.

306
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,988
I just got off the horn with my informant.

307
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:32,908
Apparently, Lucky Larry got into it
with someone down at the docks yesterday.

308
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:37,287
A, uh, bratwurst heir
by the name of William Kincannon.

309
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,581
Folks call him "Willy the Sausage Prince."

310
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,792
Sounds like an upstanding fellow.

311
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,420
Yeah, well, we'll bust his chops
in the morning.

312
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,299
Jack, where are you going?

313
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,217
[Jack] I, um...

314
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,553
I think it's gonna be
an early morning and, uh...

315
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,137
I'll just...

316
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,348
sleep at the office.

317
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:04,106
So, what did the missus do
to get your trousers in such a twist?

318
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,441
Cheat on you?

319
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,402
Kick your dog? Ruin your favorite shirt?

320
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,987
None of the above.

321
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,655
Couple weeks back, I...

322
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,201
went out with some of my army pals, and...

323
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,245
[sighs]

324
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,581
a few drinks in, the captain says to me...

325
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,461
"You and Shirley were
the best 20 bucks I ever spent."

326
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:31,133
Well, I thought it was fate
that brought Shirley and I together

327
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,135
in the public library that day.

328
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,387
All along, it was...

329
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,097
just about money.

330
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,558
- Shirley was a call girl?
- Yeah.

331
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,560
That's right.

332
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,313
And rousting me out of my shell shock
was her final trick.

333
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:45,855
Well.

334
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,900
Aren't you lucky

335
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,944
to benefit from the experience
your wife has gained

336
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,530
with dozens, maybe hundreds of men?

337
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,201
Firemen, barbers,
sailors, carnival barkers...

338
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,410
Yeah, I get it.

339
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,873
Well, if it bothers you so much,
why not just up stakes and leave?

340
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:06,585
Well, because I love her,
and, uh, she says she loves me.

341
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:11,566
So when you find out the best thing that
ever happened to you started with a lie,

342
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,759
well, it's like building a house
on quicksand.

343
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,428
Sooner or later, it all falls apart.

344
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,849
Sorry, got lost in a daydream,

345
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,478
on account of your problem
being so extraordinarily boring.

346
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,773
Have you considered forgetting about it?

347
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,027
Have I considered forgetting about it?

348
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:33,987
Is that your advice?

349
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,823
- Well, in my experience...
- [chuckles]

350
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:39,118
...problems are like Bible salesmen, or...

351
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,661
genital warts.

352
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:44,081
If you pretend they're not there,
sooner or later, they disappear.

353
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,550
Can you not paint the sword first?

354
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,176
It's ridiculously heavy.

355
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,011
Perhaps you'd like a break, sir.

356
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,095
[groans]

357
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,179
[Jack] Yeah.

358
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,727
Why don't you take a load off, Willy?

359
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,312
Who the hell are you?

360
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,022
Jack Monroe, PI.

361
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,108
Lucifer Morningstar, Devil.

362
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:12,942
Carmina!

363
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,610
Tea!

364
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,078
My dear friend Sigmund
would have had a field day with you.

365
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,037
Where's the ring?

366
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,665
The what?

367
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,333
Never mind, I'll find it myself.

368
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,334
What are you doing?

369
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,296
What is he doing? What is he doing?

370
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,047
Can you please tell me what he's doing?

371
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,425
Hey, I wouldn't worry about that.

372
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,135
What I would worry about is,

373
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:42,389
we heard you had a pretty heated exchange
down at the docks yesterday.

374
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,224
Guy named Lucky Larry.

375
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,017
So?

376
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,771
So Lucky Larry stole my friend's ring
and then wound up dead.

377
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,982
Stabbed in the back,
some sort of fancy knife.

378
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:52,900
[Willy laughs]

379
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,736
Wait, you think I killed him?

380
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,529
I would never.

381
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:01,241
I mean, I could if I had to, but I didn't.

382
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,035
And I don't know anything about a ring.

383
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,120
Does anyone know about your whereabouts
last night?

384
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,204
Yes.

385
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,664
My portraitist.

386
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,918
I was posing as Hannibal crossing the Alps
until almost midnight.

387
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,546
The overtime fees for a rental elephant
are unconscionable.

388
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,632
How do you know Lucky Larry exactly?

389
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,717
- [grunts]
- [armor clanging]

390
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,637
[groans]

391
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,930
[gasps]

392
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,224
[grunting]

393
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,435
From time to time,

394
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:32,105
I purchase a trinket or two from Laurence.

395
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:35,943
How they come into his possession,
I do not ask.

396
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,654
I collect <i>objets de guerre.</i>

397
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,199
If he has something that I enjoy,
he calls me.

398
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,452
I just love war, don't you?

399
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:48,829
Sure.

400
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:50,998
Fifth Infantry.

401
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,501
Battle of the Bulge.

402
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,296
And now, where exactly did you serve?

403
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,464
I would have, but...

404
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,382
asthma.

405
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:02,219
That's why I was so upset when Lucky Larry

406
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,846
insisted that we have our meeting
up on the docks.

407
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,390
There was dirt everywhere.

408
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,809
I'm almost certain I stepped in feces.

409
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:12,020
I'm beginning to think
that Willy here doesn't have the brains

410
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,184
to have nicked Lily's ring.

411
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,523
- [Willy chuckles]
- No kidding.

412
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,400
Where do you and Larry meet normally?

413
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,734
At his apartment.

414
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,653
It's not much cleaner than the docks.

415
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:22,447
And yes, I will have Carmina
write down the address for you.

416
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:24,699
Thanks.

417
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,203
- Quite a unique fellow, aren't you?
- Mm.

418
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,791
There's a word to describe you,
but I can't quite put my finger on it.

419
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,336
It's like a shower, but French.

420
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,964
Oh, I'm sure it'll come to me.

421
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,090
[Willy] Hmm.

422
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,260
[jazz piano playing]

423
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,804
Private dick track down
that ring of yours?

424
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:46,887
Hardly.

425
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,932
Our best lead just turned up dead.

426
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,433
[sighs]

427
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,853
Sounds like that ring meant a lot to you.

428
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:00,819
I was married, a long time ago.

429
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,196
Guy named Adam.

430
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,284
Things weren't great between us.

431
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,828
Even worse between me and his father.

432
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,621
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

433
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,208
By the time they sent me away,
it was almost a relief.

434
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:20,756
I took one little piece of that garden
on the way out.

435
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,759
The stone that was in my ring.

436
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,930
I didn't like much of anything
about my life back then.

437
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,726
But I sure did love that garden.

438
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:37,563
Anyway.

439
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:41,985
The ring reminds me that
I don't need Adam or his family,

440
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:43,862
that I don't need anybody.

441
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:45,947
Oh, Lily.

442
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,157
You're married, right?

443
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,367
Yeah.

444
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,329
To my high school sweetheart, Bill.

445
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,624
We got hitched just before he enlisted.

446
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,001
Wrote each other every day...

447
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:02,005
until he got wounded in Guadalcanal.

448
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,342
But he made it out,

449
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,219
all the way to the VA upstate.

450
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,098
But the doctors, they can't...

451
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,185
We've known each other all our lives.

452
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,105
I just can't believe...

453
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:19,981
I might lose him.

454
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:24,319
Guess I'm lucky I never got attached
to anybody that way.

455
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,445
Don't you say that!

456
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,074
Every day with my Bill is a gift.

457
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,954
Knowing we may not have much time left...

458
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,833
only makes it that much sweeter.

459
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,924
[Lucifer sniffing]

460
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,551
Ugh!

461
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:51,054
Well, I don't know why
they called him <i>Lucky</i> Larry.

462
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:56,268
This apartment is literally
the most depressing hovel I've ever seen,

463
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,687
and I've seen Kafka's Hell loop.

464
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,487
Your friend's ring might not be here,

465
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,323
but there is plenty of useful information.

466
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,159
- You see this rug, crumpled up?
- Mm.

467
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:15,620
I think this is where our killer
bopped Larry right in the kisser.

468
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,373
Larry falls backwards, here,

469
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,624
hits his head

470
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,169
right here on the table,
where you see these wood chips.

471
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,252
[Lucifer] Mm-hmm.

472
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,129
But then...

473
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:26,923
he shakes it off.

474
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:32,137
He gets up and he charges at our killer.
You, like this.

475
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,431
- Oh!
- He knocks the wind out of him.

476
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,451
- Sorry, pal.
- That's all right, I love role play.

477
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:40,061
Things are looking up for our pal Larry,
until the killer pulls out a knife.

478
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,481
- Ah-ha!
- Larry...

479
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:46,026
heads to the window,
but the window was painted shut.

480
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,696
He tried, he wrenched it open.

481
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,367
He got halfway out when the killer...

482
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,662
comes over, stabs him in the back...

483
00:24:58,872 --> 00:24:59,873
creating that

484
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:01,415
blood spatter.

485
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:02,959
Oh!

486
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,961
[sighs] And then...

487
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,882
Larry escapes into the evening.

488
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,885
Only to expire on your doorstep.

489
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,180
I just wish we had some more evidence

490
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,682
pointing us to whoever dusted
poor old Larry.

491
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,435
Well, actually,

492
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,687
I might have something.

493
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:24,897
[sniffs]

494
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:27,108
A very expensive cigar.

495
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,652
Well, just the tip. [chuckles]

496
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:31,780
Romeo y Julieta,
a favorite of Winston Churchill and...

497
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,864
Our old pal...

498
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,658
- Tony Stompanato.
- Tony Stompanato.

499
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,705
[Jack] Huh.

500
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:47,504
So Stompanato finds out
Lucky Larry stole his girl's ring...

501
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,589
poses as a buyer...

502
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,424
gets the ring back.

503
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,385
Then kills the thief to avenge the girl.

504
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:56,137
But if Stompanato did all this
to impress Lily Rose...

505
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,430
Why not give her the ring?

506
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,514
Yeah.

507
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,102
[suspenseful music plays]

508
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,365
[suspensful music crescendos]

509
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,337
Rise and shine, Stompanato.

510
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,774
That certainly explains
why he never gave Lily's ring back.

511
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:54,154
Looks like Mr. Stompanato's bark
was worse than his bite.

512
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,331
They took his heart.

513
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,440
What do you think they did with it?

514
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:08,668
Well, he didn't seem the type
to wear it on his sleeve.

515
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:09,878
I'll check the floor.

516
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:10,961
[Jack] Ugh.

517
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:16,675
Huh.

518
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,513
Looks like we were right about
Stompanato rubbing out Lucky Larry.

519
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,975
Same insignia as the knife
in Lucky Larry's back.

520
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,853
But who rubbed out Stompanato?

521
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,272
I think I know the answer to that.

522
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,191
A man after his own heart,

523
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,276
and Lily Rose's ring.

524
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:37,822
[sighs] But it appears we're too late
on both counts.

525
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,076
Who would have the stones
to carve up Stompanato,

526
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,536
and what's that wackadoo symbol
on his face?

527
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:44,954
They're hieroglyphics.

528
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,875
I believe it's the Eye of Horus,

529
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:51,169
a sacred symbol
in ancient Egyptian culture.

530
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:52,671
Sacred eye.

531
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,423
I've heard that before.

532
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,884
I think I know where to find
our graffiti artist.

533
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,271
[Jack] Hmm.

534
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,236
- Salutations.
- Bloody hell!

535
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,446
[gasps]

536
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,323
Have you come seeking...

537
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,282
books?

538
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:25,704
Yeah, we have come...

539
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,790
seeking books.

540
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,082
Oh.

541
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,962
Thought you were here
for the secret cult ceremony.

542
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,630
Sorry, my friend is new.

543
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,800
We are <i>absolutely </i>here
for the secret cult ceremony.

544
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,334
If you wouldn't mind pointing us
in the right direction.

545
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:42,846
Right through that door.

546
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:45,515
And if you haven't mail-ordered
your robes yet,

547
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,684
there's a few extra
hanging on the coat rack.

548
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,436
Mm. Mm-hmm.

549
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,353
Lovely.

550
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:52,521
Thank you.

551
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,673
Melvin the Magnificent, at your service!

552
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,425
What is it with this place?

553
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,510
Board-certified priest, oracle,

554
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,804
shaman, and justice of the peace.

555
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,347
How may I assist you?

556
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,349
Lift a curse? Cure a nasty rash?

557
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,853
I got a love spell guaranteed
to reel in a dame at 50 paces.

558
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,314
We're looking for something
much stronger than that.

559
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:38,651
Preferably Egyptian, possibly involving
the removal of a heart.

560
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,196
Ah...

561
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:45,950
You seek the ceremony of Anubis.

562
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,871
Yes, we do.
We'll take one of those, please.

563
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:50,954
Very well.

564
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,165
Look over there!

565
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,923
For just 12 dollars, 12 dollars,

566
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,759
our deluxe ceremony of Anubis includes

567
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:05,762
this ceremonial mask, two acolytes,

568
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:08,056
and a drum made from the skin
of a Vestal Virgin,

569
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,933
a gilded sacrificial dagger,

570
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:12,602
and one live...

571
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:13,685
chicken!

572
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,606
- It never ends well for the chicken.
- [groans]

573
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:19,651
Or you might prefer

574
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,236
our economy package.

575
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,196
Uh...

576
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,656
only six dollars!

577
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,784
And the chicken heart comes pre-sacrificed
for your convenience.

578
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:30,036
[Lucifer] Not accurate,
historically speaking,

579
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,704
but quite, uh, bloody.

580
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,748
My old friend
Tutankhamen would've loved it.

581
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:37,377
In the modern age,
we are taught to fear death.

582
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,213
But the ancients understood that death...

583
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,048
is power.

584
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,884
[suspensful music plays]

585
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:46,886
Did you feel powerful

586
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,266
when you were holding Tommy Stompanato's
heart in your hands after you killed him?

587
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,311
Somebody killed Tommy Stompanato?

588
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:00,275
You... You can't possibly believe that
I had anything to do with that.

589
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,068
Oh, yeah. We absolutely do.

590
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:05,071
Yes, tell us, Melvin the Magnificent.

591
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,407
What is it you desire?

592
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,369
- I...
- Yeah...

593
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:12,452
...want...

594
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,079
Yeah.

595
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,332
...a 1941 Pontiac Torpedo.

596
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,088
Eight-cylinder engine, 103 horsepower,

597
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:25,550
zero to forty in under three minutes,
and...

598
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,760
surprisingly affordable.

599
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,847
A few of these deluxe ceremonies a week,

600
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,600
a couple of sacred objects here and there,

601
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,727
and I'm cruising the open road by summer.

602
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:40,315
You killed Stompanato and then you stole
my friend Lilith's very special ring,

603
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,735
so forget the open road.
The only place you're going is downtown.

604
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,069
Hold the line there, pal.

605
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,614
Are you talking about the ring of Lilith?

606
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:48,990
Because my clients...

607
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:54,120
uh, <i>parishioners,</i> would pay top dollar
for even a slightly passable fake.

608
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,413
We could split the profits.

609
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:58,333
Objects of immortality are my bestsellers.

610
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:01,961
Right. Can any of your "parishioners"
account for your whereabouts

611
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,338
from noon to 6:00 today?

612
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,756
Well, sure, I was here.

613
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,841
I did four tarot card readings...

614
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,509
uh, an exorcism...

615
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,554
and a bar mitzvah.

616
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,973
- Oh...
- Tony Stompanato's heart was ripped out

617
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,100
in an identical manner
to your little chicken scam,

618
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,061
so if it wasn't you that killed him,

619
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,646
it had to be one of your customers.

620
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:22,190
Did you tell any of them
about the ring of Lilith?

621
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:25,735
Well, sure. I've been selling maps
to Lilith's tomb for years, but...

622
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,839
I couldn't tell you who bought them
on account of all the robes.

623
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:33,242
[sighs] Well,
that was a clucking waste of time.

624
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,873
I'm afraid we've hit a dead end.

625
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,960
Found a few heart puns,
had a few laughs, but...

626
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:45,296
it seems you'll have to live
without your ring.

627
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:50,593
So, why don't I repay my debt
some other way?

628
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:56,224
A castle, a private island,
a mountain of gold?

629
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,727
The world is your oyster,
and I, your concierge.

630
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,731
Thousands of years, Lucifer,

631
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,943
and that ring has always been with me.

632
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,029
It reminds me of who I am,

633
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:13,324
why I have done the things I've done.

634
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,786
You mean, why you sent
your children to Hell?

635
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,372
I gave you an army!

636
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,666
An army I never asked for.

637
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,333
And...

638
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,837
one I didn't know I needed at the time.

639
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:31,968
But... without them I would have spent
eternity alone, and...

640
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,304
for that, I shall be forever in your debt.

641
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:40,560
Which is why I'm truly sorry
I couldn't get your ring back.

642
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,190
So am I.

643
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,068
[Lucifer sighs]

644
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,444
So...

645
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:54,073
How exactly did everyone get the idea

646
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,451
it's the ring that makes you immortal,
anyway?

647
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,076
Hmm?

648
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:00,872
Uh...

649
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:05,168
So I hitch a ride through the Americas
with this explorer,

650
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,753
Hernán Cortés,

651
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:10,882
obsessed with gold, rains bloodshed
and terror wherever he goes.

652
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:11,966
A real wet blanket.

653
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:19,766
I split the second we hit land and hook up
with this strapping Aztec warrior.

654
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:21,768
Moctezuma.

655
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:27,190
We have a few drinks,
he asks if I'm a virgin.

656
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,402
I say yes because that always got
the folks in Spain going.

657
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,488
- Mm-hmm.
- Next thing I know,

658
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:36,157
some priest fellas
are throwing me in a volcano.

659
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:37,950
I survive, and...

660
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:42,038
somebody writes it on a stone tablet.
You know how these things start.

661
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,248
[laughs] I do.

662
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,125
[sighs] Mortals.

663
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:49,378
Wouldn't mind seeing the look
on that thief's face

664
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:52,632
when they realize that
that ring doesn't do a damn thing.

665
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:53,715
Hold on.

666
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,761
The ring doesn't work,

667
00:34:57,553 --> 00:35:00,681
which means the thief will be looking
for a way to make it work.

668
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:06,521
Lilith, I believe I've found a way
to get your ring back.

669
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:11,067
All we need is a high priest, a jeweler,
and a distraction.

670
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:20,993
Thanks to a certain high priest-
cum-magic school freshman I know,

671
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,912
the word is out that your ring only works

672
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:25,414
when it's attached
to this rather gaudy bangle.

673
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:28,126
So whoever stole the ring
will come back for this...

674
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:29,709
bracelet.

675
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,504
The thief waits till you're on stage

676
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,714
and sneaks into your dressing room
just as before,

677
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,342
except this time,
our pal Jack will be watching.

678
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:39,011
Jack catches thief, thief gives up ring,

679
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:42,116
and before you know it, that little
piece of Eden will be back on your finger

680
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,850
- where it belongs.
- [chuckles]

681
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,605
Hey...

682
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,233
[sighs]

683
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,988
I appreciate you doing this.

684
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:59,240
Well, your friend Lucifer said
you needed me.

685
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:02,243
But when this is over,
I'm taking the bus to Des Moines.

686
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,245
I'm gonna move back in with my mother.

687
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,625
Okay, so...

688
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:13,212
When Lily gives the cue,
you take the bracelet.

689
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,298
- Okay?
- And then I parade it around the club,

690
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:18,509
take it back to the dressing room,
put it in the safe.

691
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,760
Wait.

692
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:24,723
Just, uh...

693
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,517
Be careful, okay?

694
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,982
I'm gonna need more than that, Jack.

695
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:39,405
All this time you've spent on Earth...

696
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,159
have you ever connected with a human?

697
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,287
I've connected with thousands of humans.

698
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,956
Once, Caligula and I made a human train

699
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,418
- of 37...
- I'm not talking about sex, Lucifer.

700
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,337
I'm talking...

701
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,715
about an emotional connection.

702
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,258
Oh!

703
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,094
Absolutely not. [chuckles]

704
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,860
It would take a literal miracle for me
to want something like that,

705
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,558
and I'm fairly certain
my father's not handing those out anymore.

706
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:08,892
Why?

707
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,103
Just wondering.

708
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,569
- [audience chuckling]
- Take my wife. Please!

709
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,447
[audience laughing, applauding]

710
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:25,952
Abe Gantz, the funniest man in Manhattan!

711
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,620
[audience cheers]

712
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:31,874

Neither of them even knew what they had.

[Jack gasps]

769
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:50,841
I knew all about the ring.

770
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,469
I'm the one who hired Lucky Larry
to steal it.

771

Now put the gun down and hand it over.

How could you?

774
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,274
Because it was my plan.

775
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,652
I tracked down the ring.

776
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:13,489
I told Lucky Larry
how and when to steal it.

777
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:16,909
I even told him he could have everything
in the safe if he just gave me the ring.

778
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:18,826
And what'd he do?

779
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:22,790
Sold it to some lovesick wiseguy
who wound up killing him.

[Trixie] Time out!

781
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,335
So both Gertie and Willy
learned about the ring

782
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:27,836
from Melvin the Magnificent?

783
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,338
Correct. Mm.

784
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:33,092
Gertie hired Lucky Larry
to steal the ring,

785
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:37,513
but instead he betrayed her and sold it
to Stompanato for a higher price.

786
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:40,266
But then Stompanato killed Larry
out of revenge

787
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:42,268
for stealing his girl's ring
in the first place?

788
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,936
Indeed. But...

789
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,688

790
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:48,399
Willy the Sausage Prince

791

the Magnificent's fake cult ceremony

the rest of the story or not?

and the Brooklyn Bridge Gang.

00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:33,493
Just one thing.

893
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,829
And it never ends with you, does it?

894
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,582
Although I suppose it will now.

895
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,838
Would you like me to bring
your children up to say goodbye?

896
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:48,550
And undo everything
they've learned in Hell?

897
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,343
Never.

898
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,804
My children are perfect.

899
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:54,972
They can't be...

900
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,893
banished, because they have no home.

901
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:01,438
Can't be abandoned,
because they have no family.

902
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,691
They'll never be cast out
of the proverbial garden.

903
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,110
You can never tell them
what I've done today, Lucifer.

904
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:11,615
Not if they are going to be unbreakable.

905
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:13,951
Well, you have my word.

906
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:16,827
Well...

907
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:19,122
I never thought I'd say this, but...

908
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,708
enjoy the rest of your life.

909
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:23,210
[chuckles]

910
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,925
Right back at you.

911
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:30,926
[chuckles]

912
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:33,053
["This is Ours" by the Peter Sivo Band
playing]

<i>♪ So hold me and smile dear ♪</i>

914
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:40,894

915

916

<i>♪ For this is ours ♪</i>

917
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,998
That ring has Lilith's immortality
inside it?

918
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:04,208
Yes.

919
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:05,836
I suppose it does.

920
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:11,341
Though, as far as I'm concerned,
the only thing special about it is...

921
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:15,095
it reminds me of an old friend.

922
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,683
So, what happened to Jack and Shirley?

923
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,977
Did they live happily ever after?

924
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,063
Well, they moved to Des Moines, so...

925
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,106
probably not.

926
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:27,441
[Lucifer chuckles]

927
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:31,820
My mom says dealing with your problems
is the only way to get past them.

928
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:36,283
I bet Jack and Shirley talked
the whole bus ride and fixed everything.

929
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,951
Yes.

930
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,495
Yes, perhaps they did.

931
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,164
Right.

932
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,666
Story time's over.

933
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:56,470
Thanks, Lucifer. This was fun.

934
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,680
[scoffs] Don't exaggerate.

935
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:08,732
You got the story?

936
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:18,575
I taught you well, kid.

937
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:25,874
Once upon a time,
the Devil went to New York City.

938
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:28,668
The year was 1946.

939
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,630
Are you Lily Rose?

940
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:18,635
Who wants to know?

941
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,720
It's me.

942
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:23,556
Mazikeen.

943
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:30,438
Lucifer told you that I was here,
didn't he?

944
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:35,777
You'd think the Devil would be better
at keeping his trap shut.

945
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:38,280
No, I found you all on my own.

946
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:39,363
Have you...

947
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,783
been here all this time?

948
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,911
I gave something a shot.
It didn't work out.

949
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:46,996
That's it?

950
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,082
That's all you have to say to me?

951
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,585
What do you want from me?

952
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,172
I wanted to come and see you.

953
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:02,262
I wanted to know why you abandoned us.

954
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:05,640
Why you abandoned me.

955
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:10,270
I did it to make you strong,
and it worked.

956
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:13,106
Just look at you.

957
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:17,569
I can see you don't need anyone.

958
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,201
Yeah.

959
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:27,578
Look at me.
