- Daniel.
- [gasps]

15
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,543
You've been staring
at that same file for ten minutes now.

16
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,713
It's like watching
the world's worst nature documentary.

17
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:34,344
Have you lost the power of speech
alongside the ability to read?

18
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:37,222
Have you achieved
your final form? [chuckles]

19
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,724
What am I supposed
to do with that, Lucifer?

20
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,352
How am I supposed to react?

21
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,604
[hesitates] I don't follow.

22
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,940
Well, I know you're the Devil now.

23
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,694
You come at me with these sort of funny,
kind of clever insults, I give back.

24
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,446
We go into a little insult dance,

25
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,365
and that's a Tuesday.

26
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,201
But now everything's changed.

27
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,662
Don't be ridiculous, Daniel.
Nothing's changed.

28
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:04,124
I'm still the same person,
charming, beloved.

29
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:07,460
And you're still the same person too,
useless, tolerated.

30
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,463
Hmm. Doesn't have the same effect anymore.

31
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,174
It's like being teased
by Genghis Khan or Darth Vader.

32
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,469
I'm not some bloody villain, Daniel.

33
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,931
Oh, well,
if you're gonna be cruel about it.

34
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,225
Don't be coming to me for any favors.

35
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,144
Don't worry, I won't.

00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,062
[scoffs]

37
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:30,108
Detective Douche
is a real joy to be around today.

38
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,403
You just have to give him some time.

39
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,655
Remember what I did
when I first found out the truth?

40
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:41,035
Yes, you ran off to Europe for a month.
Oh, maybe Dan could do with a vacation.

41
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,679
Who do I know in one of those countries

42
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,039
where they hunt
American tourists for sport?

43
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:50,879
Right. Look, I'm sorry you're hurt
that you can't annoy Dan.

44
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,463
Why would I be hurt?

45
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:56,092
Uh, well,
because it's the strange little game

46
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,178
that you two play
to show that you're friends.

47
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,141
- But he's not participating anymore.
- [scoffs]

48
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,223
So just give him some time.

49
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:05,852
Detective Douche can take all the time
he needs, as far as I'm concerned.

50
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,271
Now, please tell me we have a case,

51
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,691
some puzzle to solve,
some criminal to bring in and punish.

52
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:14,110
It's right here,
and we do have someone to bring in,

53
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,321
but she's already been apprehended.
Extradition.

54
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:19,407
A Los X banger,
got caught south of the border.

55
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,867
Extradition?

56
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,411
We catch murderers, Detective.
We don't carpool them.

57
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:27,165
Lucifer... we do,

58
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,541
when we're understaffed.

59
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,920
- I know it's grunt work, but we have to...
- Grunt work, you say?

60
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,380
Hmm.

61
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,095
[sighs] All right.

62
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,973
"All right"? That's it?

63
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,601
[sighs] Chloe has Trixie tonight,

64
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:49,354
and honestly,
I think a drive might be good for me.

65
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,355
[Lucifer groans]

66
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,941
It'll give me some time
to think about things.

67
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,024
[Lucifer] Huh.

68
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,654
Hey, Dan.

69
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:03,326
Did you notice the name of
the processing officer on the other end?

70
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,997
- Luis Navarro.
- [Chloe] Uh-huh.

71
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,668
I just wanna remind you of the last time
you worked a task force together.

72
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,671
I remember. Look, you don't have to worry.

73
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,715
Yes, we were friends,
but I know what kind of cop this guy is.

74
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,801
The kind of cop who likes to cut corners,

75
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:23,513
the kind of cop looking to play angles
on a slippery slope to being a criminal...

76
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:27,684
The kind of cop
that I haven't been for a very long time.

77
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,437
I'm sorry, I know.
I'm not your mother, and I'm not...

78
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,566
even your wife anymore,
but I am your friend.

79
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,403
I know it's been a crazy time lately.

80
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:42,782
I think the last voice that you need
in your head right now is one like Luis'.

81
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:46,911
I know you're trying to look out for me,
and I appreciate that, but I'm fine.

82
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,206
[chuckles] I've got it all under control.

83
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,670
Promise.

84
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,186
- [chattering]
- [laughing]

85
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,647
[Dan] What the hell?

86
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:19,068
- Danimal! Oh! Ohhh!
- Hey.

87
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,279
[in Spanish] How's it going, man?

88
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,865
Still banging gorgeous blondes up in LA?

89
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,034
Luis, what are we doing in a bar?

90
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,369
I'm here
for the extradition of a prisoner.

91
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,871
[laughing]

92
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,081
[in English] <i>Hermano, </i>your Spanish

93
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,834
is about as rusty
as that squad car outside.

94
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,253
You need
to stay down here a little longer.

95
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,965
- Get a little Spanish immersion.
- Yeah, I'll talk to my captain about it.

96
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,010
Listen, why are we not meeting
at the police station, bro?

97
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,512
Oh, crap. You didn't get the message?

98
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,555
What message?

99
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,475
Sorry, man.

100
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,061
There was a screwup in the paperwork.

101
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,688
The prisoner won't be discharged
till tomorrow morning.

102
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,524
What, are you kidding me, bro?
I drove all the way down here.

103
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:03,488
I know. I know, but I got it. It's fine.
I made sure that they got you a room.

104
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,406
- It's a few blocks away.
- [sighs]

105
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,243
All right, all right, yeah. Uh... just for
the night. I gotta get back, all right?

106
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,121
Hey, <i>compadre!</i>

107
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,998
- [clears throat]
- Now we get caught up.

108
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,875
- Yeah.
- I wanted you to see this place.

109
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,335
I own a little piece of it.

110
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,754
- Nice.
- Let's get some drinks for old times.

111
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:22,006
I don't know, man.
It's really late, you know.

112
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,134
If I gotta get on the road early
in the morning, I don't think so.

113
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,512
Daniel. I get it.

114
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:28,679
I do, okay?

115
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,556
Maybe those old times,

116
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,393
they weren't so good, okay?
We used to play it fast and loose.

117
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,311
And I know you don't do that anymore.

118
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,606
And the truth is, I admire you for that.

119
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,067
I'm turning myself around too, and,

120
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,737
I just wanted to get some advice
from someone who did it before I did.

121
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,114
That's all.

122
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,451
One drink.

123
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:54,205
- [shouting in Spanish]
- [in English] One, just one. No!

124
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,623
[both laugh]

125
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,291
- [Luis chuckles] Salud.
- [Dan] Salud.

126
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,963
- Oh, man.
- [exhales]

127
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,256
I've had my few beers.

128
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:06,843
I think I should go check out
the hotel room and watch some HBO.

129
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,261
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

130
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:11,806
- One more drink so I can ask you.
- [sighs]

131
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,434
Back in the day,
when you had that old partner.

132
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:18,354
You guys had some fun extracurriculars.

133
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,815
- [chuckles] Yeah.
- What changed that for you?

134
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,485
Uh, it's pretty simple, really. Uh...

135
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:29,031
Couple years back, I got into
some trouble on Palmetto Street.

136
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,118
Long story short,
I got in way over my head,

137
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,329
and I realized that
when your motives are bad

138
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,582
and when you're only out for yourself,

139
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,333
your actions have consequences.

140
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,586
But now?

141
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,045
Ah, it's just...

142
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,551
Let's just say that I had

143
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,052
a moment of clarity.

144
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,599
Think God and the Devil.
Let's say they're real, right?

145
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,018
- Like, as real as you and me.
- Huh.

146
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,352
You find that out...

147
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,398
makes you worry more. Not less.

148
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,692
You mean like your soul?

149
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,944
[laughing]

150
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,655
No, man. Worse, way worse.

151
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,700
Because if God is like you and me,

152
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,076
that means he's fallible.

153
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,787
He makes mistakes.

154
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:22,418
And if God can make a mistake,
what does that say about the universe?

155
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,463
I mean, who's even in charge?

156
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,423
How could anything even matter anymore?

157
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,759
That's heavy, man.

158
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,806
But if you're feeling like
nothing really matters, then...

159
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:40,645
maybe you'll consider joining me
in a business venture.

160
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:41,604
[Dan groans]

161
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,524
I run these holistic crystals up to LA.

162
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,527
Housewives up there love this shit, okay?

163
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,071
I tell them that
they're ancient Aztec <i>cenotes</i>.

164
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,865
But really they're just beach rocks,
my friend.

165
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:56,202
I pick them from my sister's property
in Rosarito. Pure profit!

166
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:59,121
I thought you said you weren't
into anything illegal any more.

167
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,165
Illegal? They're rocks.

168
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,625
So it's legit?

169
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,544
It's legit money. Huh?

170
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,545
It's low-risk.

171
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:09,882
I just need a man on the other end
to make sure that it runs smooth.

172
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,344
Just not me anymore, man.

173
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,136
Can't help you.

174
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,807
I understand.

175
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,560
It's no problem. Stupid idea. Okay?

176
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,811
[laughs]

177
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,813
I'm just happy you're here now.

178
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,231
Benito!

179
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:28,442
- [Benito shouts]
- [laughing]

180
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,070
- [Benito speaks Spanish]
- Oh, come on.

181
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,906
This is Benito. He's my partner.

182
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,742
- You know why Benito is always smiling?
- Why?

183
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:40,037
- He's got the best tequila in town.
- [Dan scoffs]

184
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,124
[speaks Spanish]

185
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,209
- [Luis] Hey, hey, hey! Hmm?
- Ah.

186
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,170
- [Luis speaks Spanish]
- [glasses clink]

187
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,590
- [Dan chuckles]
- To better days ahead.

188
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:54,677
- [Benito speaks Spanish]
- [Luis whooping]

189
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,760
No, no.

190
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,809
[rooster crows]

191
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,395
[groans]

192
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,565
[grunts]

193
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,652
[gasps, grunts]

194
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,660
[gasps, yells]

195
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,544
Luis, Luis, wake up!

196
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,755
Where's my phone? We need help!

197
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:31,672
[panting]

198
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,342
- What? Why are you naked?
- [Dan] What?

199
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:39,347
Oh, uh, uh, because I sleep naked.
It's a thing. Don't worry about it.

200
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,474
Benito. He's dead!

201
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:47,438
If this is some kind of sick joke,
Danimal, I swear...

202
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,232
[groans]

203
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,443
Oh, God. You're right.

204
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:53,861
He's dead.

205
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,613
Yeah. [panting]

206
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,823
Look, man, we need to call this in.

207
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:01,160
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a minute. Wait a minute.

208
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,620
Hold on.

209
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,080
Take a breath.

210
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,998
Let's think this through.

211
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,626
What do you mean, think this through?

212
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,212
Wait, you don't think that...

213
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,050
Luis, I don't fully remember
whatever the hell happened last night,

214
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,885
but I did not kill anybody.

215
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,346
I know you didn't kill anyone, my friend.

216
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,224
Because I know who did.

217
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:29,021
Okay, so those crystals
I was talking about?

218
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,525
Maybe the risk wasn't quite
as low as I led you to believe.

219
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,654
That's why I was hoping
you'd sign up as my man in LA.

220
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,739
To replace the guys who are there now.

221
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:39,657
Russian guys.

222
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,451
So what are you saying,
these are the guys who killed Benito?

223
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,369
Why?

224
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,496
Because they're Russian mob.

225
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,082
And they knew
Benito was in the scam with me.

226
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,543
I figure they must've hit him
when he left here last night.

227
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,626
So then what?

228
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,296
He came in here looking for help maybe?

229
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,758
Goes to the back room,
collapses, and that's that?

230
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,136
Why would they wanna kill Benito?

231
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:04,764
Wait a minute.

232
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,017
How much do you owe them?

233
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,271
- Two hundred thousand dollars.
- [sighs]

234
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:13,274
But I have it. I can pay them,
I was going to pay them.

235
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,067
Okay? I just wanted one more day.

236
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,570
Okay, there was
this horse race this afternoon.

237
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,530
Daniel, I swear. It was a sure thing.

238
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,408
I would've doubled my money,
I could have paid with interest.

239
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,952
I really wanted to believe
that you'd turned things around.

240
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:28,080
But this has gotta be
the most reckless thing you've ever done!

241
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,415
I can't believe this.

242
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,041
Look, I know I screwed up,

243
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:35,004
but I didn't think that the Russian mob
in LA was gonna come after me like this!

244
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,173
I'm all the way down here, and I'm police!

245
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,718
Well, then you obviously don't know
how the Russian mob operates, do you?

246
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:41,927
No.

247
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,724
But you do, don't you?

248
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,519
No.

249
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,523
No way am I getting involved
in this with you, Luis.

250
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:59,278
The thing for you to do right now is turn
yourself in, tell your people about it.

251
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,405
- They'll protect you.
- Protect me?

252
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,074
Half of my department is
on some gangster's payroll.

253
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:09,371
Daniel, they'll come after my family.

254
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,540
Maria, little Oscar.

255
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,083
He's three.

256
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:17,129
I need to stay here
and make sure they're safe.

257
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:21,133
All I ask is that
you deliver the money that I owe.

258
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,638
Luis, I came down here
for a prisoner transfer.

259
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:28,224
Exactly. And that's exactly what you do.

260
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,894
You go get her. By the time you come
back, I'll have the money ready for you.

261
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,979
Okay? It's a small detour.

262
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,564
And while you handle that,

263
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,108
then I'll call in poor Benito's murder.

264
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,695
Please, Daniel.

265
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,031
For my family.

266
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:47,951
[sighs]

267
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,671
So, what's in the box?

268
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,089
Nothing. Stop talking.

269
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,466
Something important, huh?

270
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,968
Maybe not straight-up legal?

271
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,428
I saw that dude's face
when he handed it to you.

272
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,763
Look, can you sit back?

273
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:11,016
- Sit back, please! Thank you.
- Okay, okay. No problem.

274
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,435
You know, just saying.

275
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,398
You all sweaty, with mysterious boxes.
I know corruption when I see it,

276
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:20,442
but, you know, none of my business.
We all got our demons.

277
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,946
It's not corrupt, okay?
It's the exact opposite, actually.

278
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,698
- Hmm.
- I'm helping somebody.

279
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,158
- Hmm.
- And I don't have any demons.

280
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,995
Unless you count the fact
I've been working with the Devil

281
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:34,206
for the last few years, but that's,
you know, out of my control.

282
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,500
Man, I hear you.

283
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:40,087
I was riding with the devil myself
for a few years, you know. Cocaine?

284
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,465
- That's not what I'm talking...
- You don't have to justify yourself to me.

285
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,550
I feel you. It's hard.

286
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,510
It got a hold of me for a while.

287
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:51,098
Yeah, I was banging with the X's,
getting up to notorious shit.

288
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,517
And I wasn't proud of it,
so I turned it around.

289
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,978
Oh, right, you turned it around, huh?

290
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,855
Yeah, man, I did.

291
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,399
- And you know what helped me do it?
- What?

292
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,482
God.

293
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,404
He saved me, man,
and I ain't trying to preach to you.

294
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,864
You wanna get out of this?

295
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,240
Find God.

296
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,659
[laughs]

297
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,202
Oh, I found God.

298
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,998
And he exploded my entire body
for sleeping with his wife,

299
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,834
so I don't think
he's quite the guy you think he is.

300
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,337
Whatever. God is whoever you say he is.

301
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:26,133
And I say that God is someone that
gives me the strength to do better.

302
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,843
And I know I can be better.

303
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,470
Not just for God, but for me.

304
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,058
Look, I hope
this works out for you, I really do.

305
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,393
But you need to be careful, okay?

306
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,729
Because you think you know things,

307
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,273
but then life has
a way of blindsiding you.

308
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,275
[engine revs]

309
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,372
[animals calling]

310
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,915
[Dan groaning]

311
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:05,546
[grunts]

312
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,343
[seat belt unclips]

313
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,137
[grunts]

314
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,349
[panting]

315
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,727
Huh!

316
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,943
[shouts]

317
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,028
[panting]

318
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,409
Of course it's dead! [huffs]

319
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,576
[car approaches]

320
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,298
Dan?

321
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,134
Espinoza?

322
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:52,636
Ryan?

323
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,223
Yeah, it's me, Ryan, and Kevin from class.

324
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:57,808
Hey.

325
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:01,145
Hey, you know,
we haven't seen you in improv in ages.

326
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:05,983
We're just driving back from a show
at the El Cerrito Community Center. Yeah.

327
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,318
You know,
you're missing out on a lot of sweet gigs.

328
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:09,987
Yeah.

329
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,115
Uh, yeah, I've been...
I've been pretty busy lately. [chuckles]

330
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:14,782
Yeah.

331
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:16,869
You got a little, uh...

332
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,455
What? Ugh.

333
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,665
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

334
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,417
- Oh, man.
- Gentle.

335
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,170
[groans] I think it's spray paint.

336
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,631
I was, uh... I was ambushed by Los X's.

337
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,052
- They're a notorious street gang.
- Oh!

338
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,304
They T-boned my car, tagged it.

339
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,139
My face must have been in the way.

340
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,102
Do you need some help?

341
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,273
Uh, y-yeah.
Actually, you think I can get a ride?

342
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,735
- Yes. And?

- Right. Improv 101.
- [laughs] Oh, God!

346
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,577
- Where do you need to go?
- Oh.

347
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,120
- Just get in the back.
- Yeah.

348
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:04,041
Jiggle the handle. The belt doesn't work,
so you just gotta yank it hard.

Fancy seeing you here.

353
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,394
Well, not fancy at all, actually.

354
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:29,108
You look... Well, it's hard to tell
sometimes, but you look truly awful.

355

361
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:54,758
Really, Daniel, I'd do a spit take,
but this is single malt.

362
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,260
[laughing]

363
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,095
Come on, man. Are you done?

364
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,598
Well, I was until I remembered
the last time you lost a fugitive.

365
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,122

yourself on that roller coaster?

366

I didn't soil myself, Lucifer.
And look, this isn't like that, okay?

367
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:11,275
This girl was rescued by her gang.

368
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,152
And I know their hangout.

369
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,904
It's a bike shop in Van Nuys.

370
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,408
- If we go there, we're gonna find her.
- "We"?

371
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,202
Well, why do you need my help?
You're a police officer.

372
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,664
If you need backup making an arrest,
you have the entire LAPD.

373
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,207
It's not that simple, man.

374
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:30,377
Los X's didn't just
spring my fugitive, they also...

375
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,716
sort of, stole something from me.
Something that I need to get back.

376
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,929
Oh, so if the police get involved,
the drugs will be confiscated.

377
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,181
It's not drugs!

378
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,851
[sighs] It's money
that an old friend needs me to deliver

379
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,895
so he can get clear
of some dangerous people.

380
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:51,124
Now it's in the hands of a street gang
who probably don't realize what they have,

381
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:55,569
and you need to get it back
before they do. Oh, Daniel. [laughs]

382
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,446
This could only happen to you.

383
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,407
Oh, man, I swear.

384
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,620
Sometimes it feels like
the entire universe is against me.

You don't think your dad
could be behind this, do you?

388

[laughs] No. Definitely not.

No.

391
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,801
Well, I don't exactly know where he is,

392
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:23,805
but I can guarantee he's dealing
with something much bigger than this.

393
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,351
[exhales] Okay.

394
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,730
So, can you help me?

395
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,899
I mean, you're invincible, right?

396
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:37,069
You can go in there. You can beat up
the entire gang, and I can grab the box.

397
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,196
I'm not your muscle, Daniel.

398
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:42,532
I don't just go in
and beat people up like some hired goon.

399

Look, man, I'm not...
I'm not trying to offend you.

400
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,788
Okay? But there are lives at stake here.

401
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:52,167
[sighs] I can't do it without you.

402
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,169
Fine.

403
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,716
But we'll do things my way,
no vulgar strong-arm stuff.

Hello, gang members.

411
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,452
I understand you sell bikes,

412
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:11,496
and I would like to purchase
your most expensive one, please.

413
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,209

414
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,461
Mm-hmm.

415
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,508
Oh. Oh, I thought you sold motorbikes.

416
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,469
Oh, that's embarrassing.

417
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:29,848
Well, looks like I'm gonna
have to rethink this entire thing.

418
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,559
Nobody rides motorbikes.

419
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,102
All that noise?

420
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,188
Plus, you get killed on those things.

421
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,271
This is the hype.

422

Well, wouldn't be the first time

on something I don't know how to use.

you never learned how to ride a bicycle?

425
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:49,159
Hey, <i>mija</i>,
not everybody had their pops around

426
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,161
to teach them everything
when they was young.

427
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:53,246
Don't go making hurtful assumptions.

428
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,624
You don't know this man's story.

[hesitates] Well,
actually, that <i>is</i> my story. To a T.

I feel you.

431
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,050
My old man was never around either.

I'm trying to make better decisions now,
but it's hard, you know?

433
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,888
Never had my role model.

I haven't seen him in essentially forever,

439
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,213
and then he turns up out of nowhere

440
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:46,133
and announces that
he's getting old and he's retiring.

441
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:49,052
I mean,
what am I supposed to do with that?

[sighs]

443
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:53,348
Or maybe he wants
to spend time with you, <i>ese.</i>

444
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:57,769
When my <i>papi</i> retired
from working as a guard up in Pelican Bay,

445
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:01,982
it was awkward at first, but we actually
got to know each other really well.

446
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,443
Even better than
when I was locked up in there.

447
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,654
Well, my dad was my jailer too.

448
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:10,449
It's a very specific
kind of pain, isn't it?

449
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,702
And mine had to turn me in
for stealing credit card numbers, homes.

450
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,328
It was my birthday too. [sighs]

451

Mm-hmm. Right.

452
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,758
That doesn't belong to you.

453
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:29,718
Hand it over.

454
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,095
Doesn't belong to you either.
You're not a Los X.

455

Actually, it does belong to me.
Or my... my friend.

Whatever, it doesn't matter.
I have the gun, give me the box.

00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:03,395
Yes, and unfortunately, he's with me, and
it appears he's gotten what he came for,

482
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,480
so we'll be off, thank you very much.

483
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,566
We were having a moment, homes.

00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,860
And it was a sincere moment.
We shared, and we bonded, didn't we?

Also, you need to keep
some drinks here other than kombuchas.

514
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,486
What do you do when you have company?

515
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,905
You lied to me, Luis.

516
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:40,784
You didn't send me
to make some payment to the Russians.

517
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,828
You sent me to deliver a message.

518
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:45,622
What are you into, man?

519
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,582
That guy was your friend!

520
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,001
Benito was not my friend.

521
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:51,711
He was an employee.

522
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,714
He kept the books for me,
and he betrayed me.

523
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,218
He was secretly working
with the Russians for months.

524
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,179
[gasps] Wait a minute.

525
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:05,517
The Russians aren't your loan sharks.
They're your competition.

526
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,811
You're in some kind of
a war with them, aren't you?

527
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,021
That's right.

528
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,648
And I'm gonna win too.

529
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,234
[scoffs] I don't understand.

530
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,945
Why would you get me involved in this?

531
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,905
You could've had
anybody deliver that package.

532
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,990
And risk using one of my own guys?

533
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,035
Come on, Daniel,
that's not smart business.

534
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,829
But having you do it is.

535
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,958
If the Russians decide
to kill the messenger, I lose nothing.

536
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,376
They're cop killers.

537
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,461
But if somehow you survive, well,

538
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:38,383
now you're on the hook for transporting
human remains across crime syndicates.

539
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:39,466
And I own you.

540
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:43,012
- It's a win-win.
- [laughing]

541
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:45,348
You're not gonna win anything, Luis.

542
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,809
I am never gonna work for you.

543
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,938
You need to adjust that attitude, Danimal,
because I'm not done with you yet.

544
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:56,443
I had a perfectly good plan
to throw the Russians into chaos,

545
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,028
and you had to screw up
and lose that head.

546
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,072
What are you talking about? It's there.

547
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,615
Now it is.

548
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:05,034
But it got stolen from you. Remember?

549
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:09,247
And when I heard,
I sent my man Vargas to recover it,

550
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,958
and then he runs into you
at the bike shop,

551
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,210
and you go and arrest him.

552
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:15,795
That's your guy?

553
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,757
How the hell am I supposed to know that?

554
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,008
That's all right.

555
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,509
Apology accepted.

556
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:23,678
Small thing, though.

557
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,973
I also tasked Vargas
with a hit on the Russians' bookkeeper.

558
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:31,019
A little eye for an eye,
since they made me kill mine.

559
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,270
What?

560
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,480
And thanks to you,

561
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:36,065
now Vargas is indisposed.

562
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:37,984
So you have to do it.

563
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:42,572
[chuckles] No way, man. No way. Unh-unh.

564
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:45,492
What you need to do
is turn yourself in, Luis.

565
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,828
I can't believe how far gone you are.

566
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,914
What the hell happened to you?

567
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:53,416
Better question is, what happened to you?

568
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,044
The pain on the side of your neck.

569
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,341
Ayquina neurotoxin.

570
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,135
Real nasty stuff from Colombia.

571
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:08,014
One minute you're fine and then wham.

572
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:12,769
Ten hours from now,
you drop dead, like Pablo Escobar.

573
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:15,063
[chuckles] Come on.

574
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,773
That's not for real.

575
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,858
I got a head in a box, Daniel.

576
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,945
Do I look like a man who's not for real?

577
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,990
You have ten hours to kill the bookkeeper.

578
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,367
And then I'll give you...

579
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,453
<i>Cabrón.</i>

580
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,915
[speaks Spanish]

581
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,252
And then I'll give you this.

582
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,419
The antidote.

583
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:40,462
Why?

584
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:42,966
Why are you doing this?

585
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,343
I always liked working with you, Dan.

586
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:53,226
I left you the address
of the bookkeeper on the fridge.

587
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:56,187
Along with a note to get
some LaCroix or something.

588
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,025
[gasps]

589
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,736
[typing]

590
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,447
Hey, Ella.

591
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,534
- What you working on?
- Nothing, just work.

592
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:10,617
Cool.

593
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,412
- Cool.
- Hmm.

594
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:15,290
Listen, um, so I have this case...

595
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,211
where I think, uh, someone
might have actually faked a murder.

596
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,839
And it got me thinking,
how would you do that?

597
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:25,633
You mean, how could you
tell if a murder was faked?

598
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,385
Yeah... Uh...

599
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,095
No, uh, what...

600
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:33,641
um, I wanna... I wanna
get inside the head of the criminal.

601
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:37,979
Really figure out what it would take
to pull something like this off.

602
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,565
It's pretty crucial.

603
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:41,566
For the case.

604
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:45,028
Okay, well, maybe I can look at the file?

605
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,989
[hesitates] Look, here's the thing.

606
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:54,370
You are the best forensic scientist
I have ever worked with.

607
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,165
I mean,
you're probably the best in the city.

608
00:31:57,248 --> 00:32:00,293
So I was thinking, if anyone
could figure this out, it would be you.

609
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,002
Okay.

610
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:03,671
Real talk now.

611
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:05,965
No more bull crud.

612
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:11,554
I actually do know how
to fake the perfect murder.

613
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,389
Because...

614
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,561
I've been working on it for my novel.

615
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,522
Aren't you... oh! Oh!

616
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,858
That's... that's great.
- I know. I know, right?

617
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:27,362
So, it's about a forensic scientist
who talks to ghosts.

618
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:31,824
Right? But I had to confront her
with an almost impossible puzzle,

619
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:35,078
because she herself
is an impossible puzzle.

620
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,997
She's super cheerful, but really tortured.

621
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,166
Totally transparent, but full of secrets.

622
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,210
So what about the, uh, the murder?

623
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,045
Oh, right.

624
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:47,757
So, what I came up with is pretty awesome.

625
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,719
Almost foolproof, but ugh!
It is really hard.

626
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:55,974
I mean, you would have
to arrange the crime scene just right.

627
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:59,560
Could you pull it off in,
say, nine and a half hours?

628
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,522
That's oddly specific, but let me see.

629
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:05,650
That would take about, uh...
Two hours and you add another one...

630
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,026
A two and...

631
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,569
- Ella!
- One second.

632
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:13,074
Yep, yep, you should be able to do it,
but you would need to move it outdoors.

633
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:16,077
Which means wrapping up your footwear
in a specific kind of slipper.

634
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,620
Yeah, hold on, just one second.

635
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,498
You're going really fast.
I'm just gonna write this down. Go.

636
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,261
[panting]

637
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,724
[exhales]

638
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,610
Hi. Svetlana, right?

639
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,030
May I come in?

640
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:58,703
No. <i>Nyet, nyet, nyet.</i>
No police without warrant.

641
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,621
Oh, no, no, no, I'm not a cop.

642
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,041
I mean, I am a cop,
but I'm not on official business.

643
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:06,419
Listen, this is... ha-ha! This is gonna
sound crazy. I was sent here to kill you.

644
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:07,336
[gasps]

645
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,256
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm not actually... I'm not gonna do it.

646
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:11,339
Look. I mean, this...

647
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,302
it's all fake.

648
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,679
This is just to fake your death.

649
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:19,474
- [gasps]
- Why else would I need pig's blood?

650
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,851
Or hamburger?

651
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,062
This is for the brain matter.

652
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,939
Oh, of course, it's very realistic.

653
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,317
Yeah. This is a very professional setup.

654
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,111
You see, I had a forensics friend
give me everything I need.

655
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:35,698
I know... I know it sounds insane,
but I can explain everything.

656
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:38,076
No. No, it makes perfect sense.

657
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,994
[gasps]

658
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:43,664
Oh, look, your pig blood.
It's leaking. Leaking.

659
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,250
[Dan] What? Oh, oh.

660
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,585
Hey, do you have a rag?

661
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,008
[groaning]

662
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,351
[gasps]

663
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,312
[exhales] No.

664
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,395
No.

665
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,358
[gasps] No.

666
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,151
No.

667
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,864
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

668
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,200
[panting]

669
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:22,620
[exhales]

670
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,206
Okay.

671
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,709
[beeps, dials]

672
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,921
[rings]

673
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:34,799
Hey, man, I'm really sorry to bother you,

674
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:37,260
but I think I need some help.

675
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:40,972
I am near Lake Arrowhead,
about 80 miles east of LA.

676
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:45,768
Yeah, it's a cabin with a greenish roof
and smoke coming out of the chimney.

677
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:50,439
I don't know, man. I don't know,
maybe, like, 100 yards south of a pond.

678
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,817
Uh-huh. Yeah, you... hey.

679
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,360
Hello. You there?

680
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,279
- You there?
- [wings flap]

681
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:02,285
- Hey. That was fast.
- [Amenadiel chuckles]

682
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,747
Dan, we really need to work
on your reconnoitering skills.

683
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:10,001
There's a lot of buildings in this area
that match that description.

684
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,253
Hey.

685
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,546
What happened?

686
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:14,839
Oh, this? Yeah.

687
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:17,550
It's... it's a long story.
Don't worry about it.

688
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,970
- [sighs]
- Dan, I'm your friend.

689
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,140
I'm also an angel. I can help.

690
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,433
I... I...

691
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,477
Look, I... [sighs] Look, I'm so sorry, man.

692
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:31,189
I really appreciate your help,
but you know what?

693
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,272
I can figure it out.

694
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:36,277
Hmm. Listen, if you didn't want my help,
why did you call me here?

695
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,236
I do.

696
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,738
I do. I need <i>some</i> help.

697
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:42,325
All right, somebody stole my car,
and they stranded me here and then...

698
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,952
[panting]

699
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,872
[breathes deeply]

700
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:48,956
Dan.

701
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,584
I'm not an Uber.

702
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,168
I know.

703
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:57,173
I know, and I wouldn't call you
if I had any other choice.

704
00:36:57,256 --> 00:37:00,384
But right now
I'm 100 miles away from home,

705
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,845
and I need to get back
as soon as possible.

706
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,222
Please.

707
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,142
[Amenadiel sighs]

708
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,356
[sighs] Okay.

709
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:14,607
So how does this work?

710
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,610
Do, uh... You gonna pick me up,
or do I sort of climb on?

711
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,569
Okay.

712
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,404
Oh!

713
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:25,326
Okay, so just so you know, I may pass out.

714
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,494
Or puke.

715
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:28,662
Or both.

716
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:32,124
- [exhales]
- Okay, I'm ready.

717
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:38,422
Uh, yeah. I'm trying to reach the head
of the chemistry department at UCLA.

718
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,634
I have a question about a substance
called "ayquina." It's something...

719
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,386
- What's up, Dan?
- [gasps]

720
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,388
Maze! [panting]

721
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,181
What the hell are you doing here?

722
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,727
Well, I'm not really talking
to Lucifer right now,

723
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:55,398
but I did overhear him saying that
you were spinning out of control. So...

724
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,276
I had to come see that for myself.

725
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,736
[both laugh]

726
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,447
[sobs]

727
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,031
You okay?

728
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,786
Do I look okay, Maze?

729
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:12,373
I'm having the worst day of my life.
I feel like I'm losing my mind,

730
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:16,127
and I've had, like, three concussions
in six hours. That can't help!

731
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:17,920
[exhales]

732
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,507
[Mazikeen sighs]

733
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:26,178
So, tell me about it.

734
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,014
No.

735
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,601
Amenadiel asked me the same thing,
and I can't get you guys involved.

736
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,145
Amenadiel?

737
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,188
God's greatest goody-two-shoes?

738
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:37,857
Come on, Dan!

739
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,025
I'm a demon.

740
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,527
You think there's something
you can't tell me?

741
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:46,073
- We killed a guy together.
- For the last time, we didn't kill a guy.

742
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,034
We made sure some
dangerous people found him.

743
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,328
Yeah, yeah, blah-blah-blah. Point is,

744
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:52,746
this is me.

745
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,458
No secrets.

746
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:58,626
Fine.

747
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,839
But you gotta promise
you're not gonna laugh.

748
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:07,720
[laughing]

749
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:10,598
Come on, Maze. [exhales]

750
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:13,434
I can't believe Amenadiel carried you.

751
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,686
In his arms.

752
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,522
Like a little baby.

753
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,691
[laughing]

754
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:21,984
Oh, what?

755
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:25,905
Come on, you gotta have
a sense of humor about these things.

756
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:29,283
I've only got six hours
to figure out how to live past tonight

757
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,744
and get out from under Luis' thumb,
even if I do survive.

758
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:34,413
So please excuse me, Maze,
if I don't find that hilarious.

759
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,832
Oh, God, you're such a dumbass.

760
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,918
Just set up a meet with Luis,

761
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:41,962
get your antidote,
and serve him up to the Russians.

762
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,714
Duh, we've done this before.

763
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,841
I can't get the antidote
without showing proof

764
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,219
that I actually killed
the Russian bookkeeper, so...

765
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,930
Well, that's easy. I can get you
proof of death, no problem.

766
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:53,516
Come on,
you can't actually kill her, Maze.

767
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,601
Fine.

768
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,979
I'll whip something up.

769
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,315
First I'll get in touch
with my Russian contacts.

770
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,193
Then I'll set up a meet
with you and them to explain the deal.

771
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:07,405
Then you set up
a meeting with Luis tonight,

772
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,407
with the Russians lying in wait.

773
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,700
- [snaps fingers]
- I'll get you your proof.

774
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,327
Sure.

775
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,956
Easy. Just follow a plan whipped up
spur-of-the-moment by a demon

776
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,458
to deliver a psychopath
to a bunch of murderers,

777
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,253
after I scam him
into saving my life. [chuckles]

778
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,046
It'll work perfectly.

779
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,923
Just don't screw it up.

780
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,260
Also, I'm telling the Russians
your name is Joe Stone.

781
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,387
Why Joe Stone?

782
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,598
Because Dan Espinoza sounds like a cop.

783
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,600
Joe Stone sounds cool.

784
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:40,646
You need to be... cool with these people.

785
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:42,982
Hey, Maze.

786
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:45,484
Thank you.

787
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,487
I'm sorry about the demon stuff.

788
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,990
It means a lot you're helping me.

789
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,827
I'm only helping you because it's you.

790
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:56,911
[exhales]

791
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:12,553
So that's the play.
You hide out on the balcony.

792
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,639
Once I've conducted my business with Luis...

793
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,184
then you swoop in and take him.

794
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,645
Play sounds good.

795
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:29,445
But we don't know
who the hell you are, Mr. Joe Stone.

796
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:34,991
[sighs]

797
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,621
But Mazikeen says you're okay, so...

798
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:39,704
[Linda] Dan?

799
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,208
Hi, Dan.

800
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:45,711
[man] Dan?

801
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:47,087
Who is Dan?

802
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,300
You are Joe Stone, right?

803
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:52,383
Yeah.

804
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,345
Uh, gentlemen, I just need...

805
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,765
one minute. [clears throat]

806
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,645
Linda, what the hell are you doing here?

807
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:06,273
Oh, I have lunch here every Tuesday.
I mean, the pierogis, right? Okay.

808
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:09,443
Are you okay?
Your... your eyes are bulging.

809
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,653
I need you to hit me.

810
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,405
Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but...

811
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,491
[grunts]

812
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,452
- You're undercover, right?
- Yes.

813
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,536
Don't laugh.

814
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,623
I'll explain everything later.

815
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:23,706
Okay.

816
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
[exhales]

817
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:30,965
My side piece. [chuckles]

818
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,050
I never give her my real name, right?

819
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,343
I mean, you can see why.

820
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,553
Cuckoo.

821
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,600
[chuckles]

822
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,772
That's for what you did to me.

823
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,487
Mistresses are like KGB.

824
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,615
Meddle in everything, torture you forever.

825
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,744
[chuckles] I like you, Joe Stone.

826
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,457
See you at club tonight.

827
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,459
[snorts]

828
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,758
So how do I look?

829
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,678
Pretty good, actually.

830
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:21,056
Yeah. I feel pretty good too, man.

831
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,436
I closed Lux for a private party,
and your guests should arrive shortly.

832
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,271
Everything's in place.

833
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,064
We're gonna pull this off, right?

834
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,692
Oh, Daniel.

835
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:36,488
I never lie, and I promise you
the plan is gonna work perfectly.

836
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,198
- [Dan chuckles]
- [glasses clink]

837
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,743
I really appreciate you
having my back out there.

838
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,203
Oh, no, I'm not gonna be there.

839
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:45,789
[gulps] You what?

840
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,625
Well, I have history with the Russians.

841
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,835
Trust me,
this won't work properly if I'm there.

842
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:52,046
Yeah, but I don't have
any backup down there.

843
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:55,132
Maze isn't gonna be there for a while.
If things get hairy, what do I do?

844
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:58,302
Daniel, I realize
this is your first crime-boss summit,

845
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,220
so you'll have to take my word for it,

846
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,097
but there won't be any actual violence.

847
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:05,184
It's all about appearances,
hence why I insisted on the suit.

848
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,353
And as for backup,

849
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,688
all you need are people who can act tough,

850
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:14,610
and I think I have found
exactly the right guys.

851
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,571
[Dan huffs]

852
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:18,906
You've got this!

853
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,740
All over it.

854
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,076
Right.

855
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,051
- [Ryan] Hey, Dan.
- [sighs]

856
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:41,512
How about this place, right?

857
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:45,307
- Ryan, what are you guys doing here?
- Lucifer said you needed us for a gig.

858
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,601
What, uh... How? When?

859
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,104
After we dropped you off,
we stuck around for drinks.

860
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,397

00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:47,534
I woke up this morning
with no clothes on, next to a dead body.

1036
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,202
[laughs]

1037
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:52,122
Daniel Espinoza, naked and afraid.

1038
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:53,205
Cheers.

1039
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:59,254
I don't understand
how you pulled it off, man.

1040
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:02,257
Even you couldn't control everything.

1041
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:06,553
Well, the hardest part was making sure
the detective wasn't involved,

1042
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:09,556
hence all the illegalities I knew
you wouldn't wanna share with her.

1043
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:12,892
I mean, she would've seen
through this charade right away

1044
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,645
because she's, well, a detective.

1045
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:19,107
I'm a detective.

1046
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,651
- [groans]
- [scoffs]

1047
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:24,529
After that,
there was very little to control.

1048
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:26,990
I mean, you're very predictable, Daniel.

1049
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,451
- [chuckles]
- No.

1050
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:32,787
No, no, no, no, no. You had to have known...

1051
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,499
every single decision I would make.

1052
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,210
[chuckles] How's that even possible?

1053
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:41,588
Well, I knew that you would never give up.

1054
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:47,260
At every opportunity to quit, I knew that
your oafish optimism would keep you going.

1055
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:49,888
[sighs]

1056
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:53,600
I suppose I realized
that whenever you're given a choice,

1057
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:57,979
you always at least
<i>try</i> and do the right thing.

1058
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:03,651
[scoffs] Why, thank you, Lucifer.

1059
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:09,157
[chuckles] It's crazy,
but I think I needed this.

1060
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:13,703
I've been
in a really weird place for a long time.

1061
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:17,499
[scoffs] And I think I'm through it now.

1062
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:21,753
[chuckles] I... I can't explain it.

1063
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:24,839
But you really helped me.

1064
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:30,303
Oh. Well,
that's not why I did this at all.

1065
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,057
Well, then why did you do all this?

1066
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,478
Because you fucking shot me, Daniel.

1067
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:44,150
