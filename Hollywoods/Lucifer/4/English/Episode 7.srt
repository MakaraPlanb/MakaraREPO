170
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:11,737
Well, we still don't know why Sam's
body was tossed off the bridge.

171
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,869
Because the killer is a maniacal
monster who needs to be taken down.

172
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,951
<b><font color="#808080">ELLA:</font></b> Er... maybe.

173
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:21,707
But I did discover that the killer
pistol-whipped poor Sam before he died.

174
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,922
- Sounds like it could be personal.
- And aggressive.

175
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,423
And cruel.

176
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:29,585
And a mistake,
because I was able to recover something

177
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,385
from the gun marks on his face.

178
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,601
Gold flakes.

179
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,059
- Gold flakes?
- Mm-hmm.

183
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,113
Er, no.

184
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,694
Golden gun.

185
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:51,359
It's unique and it sounds familiar.

186
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,157
Yes, Roger Moore's Bond films.

187
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,951
Perhaps our killer's Scaramanga,
the man with three nipples.

188
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:57,584
Maybe.

189
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,792
Ella, do you remember
there was a hitman...

190
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,754
or something who carries a golden pistol.
Do you remember that?

191
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,213
<b><font color="#808080">ELLA:</font></b> Ah, let me see.

192
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,384
Er... ooh, right here.

193
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:09,297
Greg Grabowski...

194
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,932
and goes by the nickname "Pony Boy".

195
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,510
Pony Boy? Stay gold indeed.

196
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,055
And you're never able to pin him down
because he's so good.

197
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,929
But if this wasn't a hit
and it was personal,

198
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,976
it would explain why he was so sloppy.

199
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,060
He sounds terrible.

200
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,273
- Let's go punish him!
- You mean, bring him to justice.

201
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,228
That's what I said.

202
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,114

That clears that up. Come on.

203
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,779
When I was a newborn demon...

204
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,119
I was smaller than my opponents.

205
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,537
But I was fast.

206
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,288
So I used my speed, kept low...

207
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,132
and always went for
the major arteries.

208
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:52,343
With my first vanquished
foe on his knees,

209
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,548
I slit my blade across his throat.

210
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:58,604
I felt the heat from his blood
dripping down my face.

211
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:05,397
And then a stranger heat in my loins.

212
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,229
Okay.

213
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:12,244
When I mentioned that the baby could
hear everything from inside the womb

214
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,613
I imagined introducing
him to things like

215
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,867
classical music...

216
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,080

217
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,290
that aren't about graphic murders.

218
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:26,672
Why would you want to hear a story
not about graphic murder?

219
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,004
We can talk about that later.

220

through shell companies
to hide the money.

304

that they get the corporate perks.

Like covering their

So who's paying for Pony Boy
to get so jacked?

307
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,713
It looks like it all tracks back
to Jacob Tiernan here.

308
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,169
That paralyzed dude's dad?

309
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,800
Does this have something
to do with that case?

310
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,377
Tiernan's son shows up
paralyzed from the chest down.

311
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,842
Then this guy dies.
So it has to be, right?

312
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,803

broken before he was killed

00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,514

- What does this have to do with him?

Maybe Tiernan thought that
Sam broke Julian's back.

317
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,558
Normally he'd hire Pony Boy
to do his dirty work,

318
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,265
- but it's his son so...
- He wanted to enact revenge himself

319
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,226
and borrowed Pony Boy's gun to do it.

320
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,937
- Yes.
- I'll get you the ME report.

321
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,277

I broke Julian's back.
Tiernan killed an innocent man.

325

What does that mean?

326
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,955

that now more than ever

spinal injury as your son.

333
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:43,437
So it would seem that possibly
someone is out for revenge.

334
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,279
My son worked with
a lot of bad people.

335

In fact, Julian wasn't exactly
a good person himself,

336

he became a killer, a human trafficker.

then what we've been doing here,
say arresting criminals...

...when I used to believe
in all that stuff,

452
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:04,449

I was doing my part

to uphold right and wrong on Earth

454

accountable, nobody will

No, the ring that Tiernan had on
had a family crest on it.

Do you guys really think he would
wear it after taking it off a dead body?

No.
