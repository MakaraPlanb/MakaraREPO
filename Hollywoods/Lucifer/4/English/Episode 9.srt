before she was murdered?

328
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,616
Anything to help us figure out
who killed her?

329
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,290
Her sister killed her.

330
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,582
Maybe, but murderers don't often use
their first phone call

331
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,955
to accuse someone else.

332
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,958
Megan took over her company's
finances a couple of months ago.

333
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,214
Is that normal?

334
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,585
I figured that she wanted
to be more involved in the business.

335
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,434
But, then, two days ago,

336
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:12,546
she dropped off a thumb drive
with a copy of her financial files.

337
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,351
Which isn't strange, but...

338
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,309
she did seem upset.

339
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,479
Did you notice anything odd in the files?

340
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:22,521
I haven't looked, but the thumb
drive is in the filing cabinet.

341
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,108

- Sure.

- No. It's best you stay covered up.

Yeah.

I was thinking about the name...

Jack.

360

Mm.

Mm.

00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,086
We could definitely
put that on the list.

364
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,717
Right after Azmortiel.

365
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,676
I was hoping for a
more mainstream name.

366
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,675
Our child is going to have
enough challenges considering his nature.

367
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,728
All these names are very mainstream
in the Silver City, Linda.

368
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:46,609
But that's not where he is
going to be living, is it?

369
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:48,858
No.

370
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,494
No, of course not.

371
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,862
But I suppose he could visit.

372
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,619
You could fly him up and
back down on holidays.

373
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,081
Do you guys have holidays?

374
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,291
No, not really.

375
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,502

495
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,163
So she either stopped
to admire her work...

496
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,417
Or it isn't her.

497
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,838
- Does the husband have an alibi?
- No, he's still our best suspect.

498
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,958
Megan's laptop is missing and he
did have easy access to that, so,

499
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:45,006
maybe he was stealing
money from their company.

500
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,050
Maybe she caught him and
they got into a fight.

501
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,974
And after a little brutal murder,
he ran off with the evidence.

502
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,643
Yeah. We're still trying to get
the husband's financial records

503
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,432
to see if he spent
a lot of money recently,

504
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,976
but his lawyer is stonewalling.
Er, Lucifer...

505
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,856
What is Eve doing sitting at my desk?

506
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,565
Detective, I was going
through the case and...

507
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:03,479
Listen, Eve.

508
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,067
If you want to dress like me, 
that's fine.

509
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,775
Weird, but fine.

510
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:11,323
But this is an official LAPD case file.

511
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,082
I think I know how to catch the killer.

512
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,288
Okay, ten seconds, go.

513
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:22,916
Whoever stole the thumb drive
was obviously covering their tracks.

514
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,213
- Right?
- Right.

515
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,916
So clearly,
there's something in that file

516
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,718
that can help us catch the killer.

517
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,850
But Willy never made a copy
of the thumb drive.

518
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,888
But what if he did?

519
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,983
- Er, he didn't.
- What if he did?

520
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:41,521
Well, he didn't,
but if we claimed to have a copy of it...

521
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,978
- And then stage a sting.
- Yeah.

Well.

I don't think Lucifer
wants to go back there.

Perhaps Lucifer simply needs a reason
to go back.

866
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,820
After all...

867
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:21,874
he's never been there before
with a queen by his side.

868
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:27,955
- Why are you helping me?
- I've dedicated my life

to preventing the prophecy.

870
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,589
If you and Lucifer were to go
to Hell together, well...

871
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,051
that would accomplish that.

872
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:37,384
It would solve both our problems.

873
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:39,298
But I...

874
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:43,345
I wouldn't even know
how to convince him to go back.

875
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:46,850
Well, perhaps remind him
of the warm welcome

876
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,314
that awaits him down there.

877
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,482
All his adoring subjects,

878
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,152
eagerly awaiting his return.

879
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,685
Yeah, that actually gives me an idea.

880
00:44:57,444 --> 00:45:01,624
Maze said that demons can enter
the bodies of the recently dead.

881
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,869
So, if one of his subjects
could rise up from Hell,

882
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,333
maybe they'd convince him.

883
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:08,871
That may work.
