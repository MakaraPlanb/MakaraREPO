a moment.

106
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,346

111
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,986

when they have so much to offer.

119

how lucky we are...

120

to do with the Detective?

00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,752
Melinda Hagey.

145
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,964
She was the sweetest
kindergarten teacher ever, you guys,

146
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,966

147
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,945

Yeah, sure.

151
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,726

152

153

actually a pretty good guess.

as a reward on the show?
