Did you notice anything

No. She was her normal, cheery self.

214

Miss Baez was awesome.
She did so much for me.

215
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:43,060
She was also the SAT prep administrator,
so helped me get into my first choice.

00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,270
It was Harvard.

217

- Oh.
- She's also just so good at giving advice

218

219
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,150

Relationships?

What advice would Miss Baez give
to, say, a student in a relationship

who, I don't know,
needed to break up with someone?

223

Oh, well, I wouldn't know.
My boyfriend and I are super-solid.

224
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,120
We'll probably get married.

00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,790

Nah, I didn't really know 
Miss Baez that well.

235
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,400
To be honest, I was thinking
about quitting YEA altogether.

236
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,360
You were going to break up
with the entire club.

237
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,150
How does one specifically
say nay to YEA?

238
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,530
Could we just stay focused, Lucifer?

239
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,160
Lucifer? As in the club
owner who grants favors?

240
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,830
You've heard of the favors?

241
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,830
Some people I hang around with,
they may have mentioned it.

242
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,830
Well, granting favors is much lower
on my resume these days

243
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,500

upon the world.

250

I was pissed because she
was sleeping with my dad.

251
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,190
Miss Baez was having an affair
with your father?

252

My parents are separated,

- But not enough so I'd kill her.

that wouldn't solve your problem.

No! Don't. I'll just tell you what it says

980
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:41,540
This will weigh on you
unless you face it head on.

981
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:45,580
The real truth is what?

982
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:52,260
There is something rotten inside of me.

983
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,340
I find it near impossible

984
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:59,640
to drown out the constant cacophony
of voices whispering in my ear,

985
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:03,100
telling me I am evil.

986
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:04,730
<b><font color="#D900D9">[SHOUTS]</font></b> I'm drowning, doctor!

987
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,110
And I can't stop asking myself...

988
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:12,230
<b><font color="#D900D9">[GASPS]</font></b>

989
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:15,030
<b><font color="#D900D9">[SHOUTS]</font></b>
why do I hate myself so much?
