So you're saying there are two murderous
demons on the loose in Los Angeles?

319
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,718
Yeah. And one appears to
have entered Kinley's body.

And they, or you...

No.

323
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:41,728
The... body has to belong
to a dead, doomed soul

324

or a demon wouldn't know where or
when there was a recent vacancy.

- Yeah.

Yeah, I'm sure Amenadiel
canceled the nurse,

486

some more time with the baby.

Yeah.

694
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,305

695
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,770
I, well...

696
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,943
I killed him.

697
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,110

698
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:56,696
summoned a demon from Hell
into his body.

701
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:06,172
I thought maybe he could convince you
that the prophecy was nonsense.

702
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,798
But he wouldn't budge and
then he gave me this idea

703
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,801
that maybe if I could get you 
out of here, back to Hell,

704

Great. There's what,
only 2, 3,000 of those in LA?

724

a house of worship,

725
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,276
but also a den of sin.

726

about one of those old civilizations.

Aztec? Or Inca?

728
