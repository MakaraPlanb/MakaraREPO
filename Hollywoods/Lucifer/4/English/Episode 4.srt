the apple.

I had nothing to do with that.
I'm a grifter, not a murderer.

Downtown tomorrow night.

There's a black market jewelry auction,

562
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,740
exclusively for the rich and shady.

563
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,200
That's where they're planning

Now that it's Pablo's last work, I bet
the necklace will go for twice as much.

565
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:46,620
The broker realized he could
double his payday if he killed Pablo.

566
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,750
Money.
It's always a solid motive for murder.
