Yeah. Marco Franklin.

372

All three of them served in the

But, wait, there's more.

374
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:44,750
Marco was just released
from prison two days ago

375
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,870
after serving a nine-year
sentence for bank robbery.

376
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,710
He bombed his way into the vault,
got caught coming out and, drum roll,

377
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,960
it is suspected he had two
other accomplices, never apprehended.

378
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,220
So Sid and Derek were his partners.
He gets caught, they don't.

379

984
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:32,580
How are you?

985
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,910
I mean, it is a lot to process.

986
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Yeah.

987
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:38,000
It is, it is.

988
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:42,260
But I didn't know who else to talk to
about this.

989
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,930
Right? My job is to read people, to...

990
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:51,140
understand their motives,
to make sense of the world.

991
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:53,640
And, right now, my world is...

992
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:55,480
celestials and...

993
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,900
immortals and...

994
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:00,940
Okay, look. Is Eve...

995
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:02,860
okay?

996
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,360
Is Eve...

997
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:06,610
secretly evil or...

998
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,820
some supernatural threat to the world?

999
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:12,370
Not that I know of, no.

1000
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:14,250
Okay, good.

1001
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:15,580
I thought so.

1002
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:17,960
Because, you know, I like her.

1003
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:19,790
I do too.

1004
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,670
Yeah, and I think she genuinely...

1005
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,170
cares deeply about Lucifer.

1006
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:29,470
And she is so protective over him.

1007
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:32,810
I practically had to force her
to leave his side and...

1008
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:36,430
I think she might be good for him.

1009
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,360
I think she might be
exactly what he needs.

1010
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,520
I hope that's the case.

1011
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,360
Yeah, me too.

1012
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:50,160
After all that you've been through,
Chloe...

1013
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:55,950
what you're worried about most is
what's best for those that you care about.

1014
00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:00,750
No wonder your dad
is so proud of you.

1015
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,010
Oh, that's sweet,
but, you know, my dad, he...

1016
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:08,220
He...

1017
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:12,890
Oh!

1018
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,720
<b><font color="#D900D9">[CHUCKLES]</font></b>

1019
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:17,350
Right.

1020
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:20,270
Thank you.

1021
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,610
<b><font color="#D900D9">["GOOD AS GOLD" BY MOON TAXI PLAYING]</font></b>

1022
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:37,620
You know, I'm really happy
you're going back to work.

1023
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:42,580
Adam's idea of paradise was laying
around all day doing nothing.

1024
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:45,500
Once we got ESPN up there, forget it.

1025
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:47,710
Well, sadly there'll be a
lot less lying around here

1026
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,720
now that I'm back to catching killers.

1027
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:54,510
But there are certain perks to having
a boyfriend who works with the LAPD.

1028
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:57,350
An endless supply of handcuffs, for one.

1029
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,770
Boyfriend?

1030
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:01,020
Well, I...

1031
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:04,110
once someone tends to you
when you're bleeding to death,

1032
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:06,110
it's only good manners
to make it official.

1033
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,330
So...

1034
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,410
we're really doing this?

1035
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,660
I'll finish making your drink
and we'll toast to it.

1036
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:23,120
- Ooh!
- Careful!

1037
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:26,170
You're fine.

1038
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:31,760
What is it with you
only getting injured sometimes?

1039
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:34,050
Oh, I'm only vulnerable
when the detective's around.

1040
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:35,340
What?

1041
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,680
Oh...

1042
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:41,310
I totally forgot.
My snake costume finally arrived.

1043
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,520
You are going to love this.
