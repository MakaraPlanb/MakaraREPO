About a month ago, she came to Rome

Well, as my therapist would say...
I know, so LA...

that talking about your issues

39
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,970

40
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,510
so if the Detective did have issues
with me...

41
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,500

Now, if that's everything, Father,
you can be on your merry way.

to warn you.

Finally, something we can agree on.

But whatever she went through,
whatever drove her to Rome...

51
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,540
it shook her to her very core.

body on the floor, called it in.

172
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,690
- I'm assuming that's the murder weapon.
- Yep.

173
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,450
A good old knife in the back.

174
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,860
Bit on the nose.

175
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,490

176
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,490
two glasses,

177
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,790
someone brought flowers.

178

She knew her attacker.

179
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,540
It's always the ones you least suspect,
the ones you trust the most,

180
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,830
that hurt you.

In my case, it was tequila.

183
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,130
Riveting.

184

None, but the victim's friend

Oscar.

187
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,310
Do you know anyone who would have wanted
to hurt Susan, Mr. Rivas?

188
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,980
No. Everybody liked Susan.

189
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,690
Who did she trust the most?

190
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,690
To be honest, I don't know much
about Susan's life here.

191
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,950
I just came from El Salvador. She was
supposed to pick me up from the airport.

192
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,910
When she didn't show, I came here and...

193
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,240
I saw all of this.

194
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,530
- And how do you know her?
- <b><font color="#808080">OSCAR:</font></b> We were in a gang.

Los Xs.

196
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,040

Gosh, and I thought I had range.

197
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,460

I wanted to pay it forward.

198

So I helped people like Susan
get out and get clean.

199
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,420
She was a drug addict?

200
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,800
Don't judge her. A lot of us were.

201
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,720
Oh, I'm not judging. I love drugs.

202
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,320
In fact, do you think she might have any
lying around? <b><font color="#D900D9">[GIGGLES]</font></b>

203

Do you know if Susan
still had any connection to Los Xs?

204
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,270
No, she made a clean break.

205
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:07,060

made an amazing life for herself.

Okay. Thank you, Mr. Rivas.

213
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,250
That I don't care
what people think about me.

Okay. I don't think that's necessary.

Right.

I hear congratulations are in order.

Some people claim
to find the life-long burden fulfilling.

I'd rather not talk about the pregnancy

Lips sealed. So, about me...

What do you do
when someone has betrayed you?

244
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,590
Normally I'd go straight to punishment,
fire, brimstone,

245
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,390
public humiliation via YouTube.

246
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,680
But in this case,
the subject happens to be none other...

I caught her in a lie.

A most heinous transgression.

Oh, and she may be plotting
to send me back to hell.

Okay, that's a very serious accusation.

- How do you know this?
- A complete stranger told me.

Have you talked to Chloe about this?

256
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,750
Well, she's lied once.
What's to stop her from lying again?

257

I just need you to tell me
how to deal with her.

Cautiously, Lucifer.

259
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,880
There may be a very reasonable explanation
for Chloe's behavior.

260
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,010
Like a spouse who suspects
their partner's been cheating,

261
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:46,560
an accusation of betrayal
is a bell that can't be un-rung.

Translation, doctor?

Susan survived Los Xs and then made it
as an engineer at Brody Aerospace.

I mean, it's great
that a former criminal got clean

269
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,886

Retribution maybe.

They're a major drug operation.

You're absolutely right,
so I'll call a judge,

took her off the NASA project.

he seems to know the most about babies.

499
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,290
This one shows the baby

500
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:39,370
that all animals poop.

501
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,800
I'm not really sure why the
baby would need to know that.

502
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,380
This one is good...

503
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,220
because it tells you what to do
when a baby is crying.

504
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,320
Although maybe you don't need this one.

505
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,720
I overheard at least three
people crying in here today

506
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,480
- and you handled it like a pro...
- It's too soon.

507
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,140

508
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:05,980
It's very kind of you and I appreciate
the gesture, I really do...

509
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,190
but I...

510
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,780
I told you you were the father
because you deserved to know.

511
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,290
Not to pressure you into helping out.

512
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,620
The truth is
I'm used to doing things on my own.

513
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,410
I don't see why raising a baby
should be any different.

514
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,630
I just wanted to help.

515
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,300

516

518

to do before my next client, so...

519
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,430

another person could get killed

Did she do something?

543
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,130
No.

544
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,590
And she never will.

545
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,350
I'm just here to tell you
that you're wrong about the Detective.

546
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,890
If she's planning anything,
it's an apology.

00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,190
I certainly hope that that's the case.

548

Oh, ye of little faith, Father.

549
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,740
Have you noticed her carrying a vial?

550
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,610
A what?

551
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,660

An ornate thing.
It's about the size of a plum.

553
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:24,500
I got word from a colleague of mine
in Rome that she'd met with a priest

554
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,670
who was hell-bent on banishing
the devil from Earth.

555
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,340
And you all get paid to do this?
I'm genuinely asking.

556
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:35,760
Supposedly, this priest has uncovered
a ceremony that would, and bear with me...

557
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:39,140
trap the devil in hell for all eternity.

558
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,770
He shared the details of
this ceremony with Chloe.

559
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,600
<b><font color="#D900D9">[GIGGLES]</font></b>

560
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:49,440
A ceremony to banish the devil to hell?
That is priceless. Ha-ha!

561
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,400
No, seriously,

562
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,150
you all need to take End of Days

563
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,780
Definitely not one of Arnold's best.

564
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,700
I know.

565
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,160
I know it sounds crazy.

566
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,120
But Chloe was very distressed
last time I saw her.

567
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:07,750
Apparently, the ceremony involves
giving the subject a sacramental liquid...

568
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,670
that would sedate the devil.

569
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,000
Ooh, let me guess.

570
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,710
It's inside the plum vial.

571
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,090
So I'm told.

572
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,930
And if it would sedate the devil,
I fear that it involves some poison.

573
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,970
Something that would kill a normal man.

574
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,970
You're incorrigible, aren't you?

575
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,770
Do you honestly think
that I would travel thousands of miles,

576
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:30,060
tell you these outlandish tales,
if I didn't take them seriously?

577
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,190
I hope beyond hope that I am wrong.

578
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,650
But if there is any chance
that Chloe could try something,

579
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,700
you need to be careful.

580
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,660
Well, consider me warned.
