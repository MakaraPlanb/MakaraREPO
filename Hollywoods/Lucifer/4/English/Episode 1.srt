322
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:19,480
You can watch humans twist themselves
into pretzels to justify what I tell them

323
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,600
instead of considering
the most obvious answer.

324
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,940
- <b><font color="#808080">CHLOE:</font></b> I think it's kind of mean.
- What?

325
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:28,780
Well, no-one in their right
mind is going to believe

- Well, without proof.

328

and figure out the metaphor.

329
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,620

from never figuring it out yourself.

Maybe they didn't like the competition
moving in next door.

334

Destroy the rival hive and suddenly
he's back to being queen bee.

Right.

Yeah. Glenn Dobbs.

What? No.

364
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,710

It was like he was
a different person.

He wasn't angry. He was...

388
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,970
He was so calm.

389
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,560
It made it even scarier, you know?

390

What did you do after he left?

391
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,560

Right. Show me again.

You know, where I'm...

396
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,780
Mm-hmm.

Never mind.

Hm. Apparently not.

so specific.

What was he in witness protection for?
Bad porn?

442
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,150
Bob was an enforcer
for the Paradiso crime syndicate.

443
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,660
His signature was beating people half
to death with a bag full of doorknobs.

ruthless reputation.

My files say you and
Bob hated each other.

570
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:38,200
We had a rivalry. He had his whole
doorknobs thing and, as for me...

571
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,780
You kill people in swimming pools,
hence the name Pool Boy.

572

It's very clever.
I see what you've done there.

573

Allegedly killed.

we learned to respect each other.

Okay, say I believe that.

576
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:52,380
Bob still put your uncle in jail
for 50 years because he testified.

577
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,090
Yeah, and we owe him for that.

578
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,340
- What do you mean?
- Uncle Vin was a bastard.

Bob did everyone a favor
by taking him out.

And as for the honey,
it isn't what it looks like.

whoever wrote it wanted Bob dead.

That's who we need to find.

614
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,220
Did Lenore know about Bob's past?

615
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,430
I don't know. I never met her.

616
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,150
Bob certainly wasn't
supposed to tell her,

to attack a honey bee farmer

Lenore didn't seem to know

Because she was afraid of him?

I think he did. I made a couple
of discreet calls to the Marshals' office.

Two of the ex-cons under
Reynolds' protection

782

- Who killed them?
- That's it.

784
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,760
One was an angry girlfriend.

785
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,430
The other was a hit and run
that looked like it was mob-related.

786
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:09,770
So our dear Marshal weaponized
the very secrets only he knew.

787

He let certain enemies know
where the criminals were hiding.

788
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:15,900
Or told the new wives the truth,
knowing how betrayed they'd feel.

789
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,070
And voila, the dirty work
was done for him.

790
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,440
That is remarkably efficient.

791
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,360
But in Bob's case, nobody took the bait.

792
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:25,620
So maybe Reynolds got frustrated
and decided to get his own hands dirty?

793
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,700

794

see if I can find more.

So, why did Lenore run?

796
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,670
Well, if Reynolds met
with her previously...

797
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,800
then probably she trusts him.

798
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,630
So maybe he reached out to her
