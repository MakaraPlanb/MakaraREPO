00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,554
<i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,992
<i>- What do you desire?</i>
- I want her to choose me.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,078
I never told you
what I want. I want you.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,000
<i>So you thought I wouldn't
find out zour mark is fake.</i>

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,311
Maybe not tonight,
but I am coming for you.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,591
Neither I nor Lucifer
have the power

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,029
<i>to get anyone into Heaven.</i>

8
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,157
I'm going to Hell.

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,510
Well, I was hoping
that you might be able

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,676
to help me out again.

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,440
Any chance to get
in His good graces, I'm in.

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,836
I know you're not trying
to freak Chloe out,

13
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,997
but you're getting
in her head.

14
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,634
- Let's elope.
- I can't marry you.

15
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry, Marcus.

16
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,353
- Oh, no ring.
- No ring.

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,436
Hey.

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,550
You know, I'm really glad
that you told me how you felt.

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,594
Oh, I don't know.

20
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,991
All that unresolved
sexual tension?

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,476
It was kind of fun.

22
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,994
They're gonna
burn the house down

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,759
if we don't get out there.

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,189
I made the batter, Dan.

25
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,191
Oh, yeah?

26
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,956
Well, sweet, because the
waffle king has arrived.

27
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,436
Step aside, my lady.

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,035
Good morning, Micah.

29
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,636
Thanks for your help.

30
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,111
Hey.

31
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,196
Are you okay?

32
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,119
Is it the same nightmare?

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,469
Except this time,
you were in it.

34
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,431
<i>So...</i>

35
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,757
are you going to tell Chloe now?

36
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,390
Tell her what?

37
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,598
Uh, everything.

38
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,911
What we talked about
in your penthouse

39
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,794
before she got engaged?

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,153
When you said,
"I want her to choose me."

41
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,078
Right. Yes.

42
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,511
No, no. No need.

43
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,280
She broke it off with Pierce,
so I win.

44
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,960
Yes, I know that they broke up,

45
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,520
but just because
she didn't choose Pierce

46
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,189
doesn't mean she chose you.

47
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,959
And just because
she un-chose Pierce

48
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,759
doesn't not mean
she didn't choose me.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,195
Point is,

50
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,675
no need to rock the boat.

51
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,115
I mean, we all know
how the detective gets

52
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,436
when you push her.

53
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,434
Plus, you know,
she's on the rebound.

54
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,239
- Those are excuses.
- I think

55
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,956
it's best if everyone involved
just goes back to normal.

56
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,752
Easier said than done, Lucifer.

57
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,270
Yes, you may be right.

58
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,673
Maybe I should <i>do</i> normal

59
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,314
rather than just say it.

60
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,989
Huh? Help speed things
along a little.

61
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,632
Ah. Another nugget.

62
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,115
Thank you, Doctor.

63
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,957
Yep.

64
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,316
Back to normal.

65
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,558
Is that really
Forest Clay's wife?

66
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,431
Chloe.

67
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,994
Before you say anything,

68
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,392
I just really want
to apologize for...

69
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,759
the event
that should not be named.

70
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,235
- The what?
- The bachelorette party

71
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,238
from hell.
I-I got caught up.

72
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,273
- I acted selfish. Just...
- Ella, it's fine.

73
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,317
And...

74
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,074
Is that someone playing piano?

75
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,318
I think so.

76
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,000
At a crime scene?

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,559
You look familiar. Have we met?

78
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:48,838
What?

79
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,791
Then you ask
if I like to play cop.

80
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,554
And I say, "No, I like
to play in general,"

81
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,479
Detective, except you were
on the other side of the piano.

82
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,036
That's right, yes. That's
what we said when we first met.

83
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,640
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?

84
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,031
I'm reminding us both
of a life less complicated.

85
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,356
You know, before all that...

86
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,274
Lieutenant-shaped nonsense.

87
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,235
So we can go back to normal.

88
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,717
For example, I'm sure you
remember this little ditty.

89
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,836
Come on, take the
top line, Detective.

90
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,110
Don't be shy.

91
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,913
Lucifer. For once,

92
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,793
I agree with you,
and I would love nothing more

93
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,320
than for things
to go back to normal.

94
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,431
Oh.

95
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,758
As long as it means
we can get back to work.

96
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,394
Yes, absolutely.

97
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,080
A mystery waits to be solved.

98
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,278
- Onwards, Detective.
- Thank you.

99
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,035
Oh, anyway,

100
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,199
I just really
want to apologize

101
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,993
for ruining
your engagement, Chloe.

102
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,475
You know,
I-I made it about me

103
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,151
when I should have been
listening to your needs.

104
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,033
You know,
what I need is to move on.

105
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,232
Agreed. There's no point
dwelling in the past,

106
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,794
so let's all move on

107
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,356
by moving even further back,
shall we?

108
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,831
I mean,
they're not breast implants,

109
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,793
- but in a pinch...
- Oh, oh, oh.

110
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,229
No, no, no.
No, no, no. Whoa, whoa!

111
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,596
- Whoa... oh!
- Oh!

112
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,115
No, no, no. Please stop.
Please stop that.

113
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,800
- Thank you.
- Why? What, they're not evidence, are they?

114
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,514
'Cause I wouldn't be the
carefree rogue of yore

115
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,358
if they weren't.

116
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,596
Not evidence.

117
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,191
- Just priceless historical artifacts.
- Ooh.

118
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,916
Okay, this baby right here
is from the World Series.

119
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,756
Everyone remembers
Gibson's home run,

120
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,480
but Clay...

121
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,593
pitched a shutout in Game 2
that was like, boom!

122
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,514
Take that, bitches.

123
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,597
Hmm.

124
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,440
Wait, do you not know
who Forest "King" Clay is?

125
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,597
- No idea.
- Cy Young Award.

126
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,230
World Series MVP.

127
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,999
Beloved American legend?

128
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,234
Is that lock broken?

129
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,879
Ella, you think this
might be a home invasion?

130
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,877
Yeah, I know.

131
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,031
I thought that, too,
but unis said

132
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,720
that it didn't look
like anything was taken.

133
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,559
Was Devon home alone?

134
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,598
No. Forest was here, too,

135
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,917
but medics took him to
the hospital for a head injury.

136
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,073
Apparently the killer
knocked him unconscious.

137
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,071
Boom!

138
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,276
Take that, bitches.

139
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,675
Lucifer,
what are you doing?

140
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,478
Oh, right.
You're smoking pot

141
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,512
because you smoked evidence
that one time

142
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,876
next to that suspect's car.

143
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,156
Oh, you remember. Yes.

144
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,874
And the time
at the teen rehab center.

145
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,276
Is it taking you back?
It's taking me, well, somewhere.

146
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,471
Can you...

147
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,110
Guys.

148
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,830
I've got a casing.

149
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,509
Oh, well, that is perfect,
Detective.

150
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,598
My shenanigans
leading to a break in the case?

151
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,235
That is quintessential
Deckerstar.

152
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,317
And the eye roll.
Now you're getting it.

153
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,277
<i>We did it, Charlotte.</i>

154
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,312
We split up
Pierce and Chloe.

155
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,717
Yay.

156
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,236
Sorry.

157
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,716
Truth is,
I don't feel any different.

158
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,797
And if Hell is
definitely based

159
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,350
on your own guilt,
then I'm still screwed.

160
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,153
Look, we did a good thing.

161
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,040
And it's important
to celebrate the tiny victories

162
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,118
- along the way.
- Right.

163
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,951
But how will I know
when it's enough,

164
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,150
Amenadiel?

165
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,830
How will you know?

166
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,072
Well, we're very different,
Charlotte.

167
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,600
I'm an angel.

168
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,593
I'll know
when my wings are back.

169
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,075
What about until then?

170
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,034
Aren't you just as mortal
as I am?

171
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,715
Well, I su...
I suppose you're right.

172
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,637
If I were to die
right now, I'm...

173
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,597
I'm not even sure
that I would go to Heaven.

174
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,031
If that's the case,

175
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,232
then there's definitely no hope
for me.

176
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,796
That's where faith comes in,
Charlotte.

177
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,235
Hope in the face
of hopelessness.

178
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,556
But faith?

179
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,871
Angel or not, what I'm hearing

180
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,356
is that you're pretty much
as clueless as I am.

181
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,594
Maybe we're not so
different, after all.

182
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,160
My God, it's Forest Clay.

183
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,951
Who's that?

184
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,473
Ah, it's just
some famous athlete

185
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,830
whose wife was killed.

186
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,320
That's Forest Clay.

187
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,671
Oh, I didn't
have you pegged

188
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,950
as a sports fan.

189
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,719
No, from my nightmares.

190
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,189
My Hell loop.

191
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,555
If his wife is dead, he did it.

192
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,916
He's the killer.

193
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,678
I was in the kitchen,

194
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,680
eating leftovers.

195
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,036
I saw a reflection
on the fridge,

196
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,471
and I thought it was Devon.

197
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,076
But when I turned around,
all I saw was...

198
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:45,436
a gun, a-a mask before
I was hit in the head.

199
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,874
I woke up on
the kitchen floor,

200
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,958
and I ran to Devon.

201
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,874
But she was, uh...

202
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,917
There was so much blood.

203
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,520
I-I...

204
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,673
I couldn't stop the bleeding.

205
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,109
You don't have
to do this right now.

206
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,231
No, I...

207
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,397
I want to.

208
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,715
Did you see anything
that could help identify him?

209
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,117
No.

210
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,957
I don't understand
who could do this to Devon.

211
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,669
<i>It was him. Forest killed her.</i>

212
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,157
- Why do you believe that?
- 13 years ago,

213
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,800
I was an associate
at Wheeler Law.

214
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,958
I'd only been there
for a few months when my boss,

215
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,436
Ben Sr., shows at my place
in the middle of the night.

216
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,110
He handed me a duffel bag.

217
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,992
Told me simply

218
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,316
to incinerate it.

219
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,473
He said it was
for an important client:

220
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,677
Forest Clay.

221
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,797
Well, what was in the bag?

222
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,311
I don't know.

223
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,830
He told me not to open it
or to ask any questions.

224
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,799
And honestly, I didn't want to.

225
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,311
Here's the thing, though.

226
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,029
There was dried blood
on the outside of that bag.

227
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,230
I'm certain of it.

228
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,755
Yes, but it's quite a leap
to thinking

229
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,952
Forest killed someone then
or now, Charlotte.

230
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,591
After years of working
at that firm, I know

231
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,916
how they operate.

232
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,675
Deep down,

233
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,793
I know what I helped cover up
was murder.

234
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:01,917
I believe her.

235
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,632
Really?

236
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,354
- Mm.
- Why?

237
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,711
Well, which quintessential
response would you like?

238
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,713
The obscure
enigmatic one

239
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,110
or the blunt nonsensical one?

240
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,630
How about the truth.

241
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,511
Well, when Charlotte had her
mini-death, she went to Hell.

242
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,314
Forest haunted her Hell loop

243
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,034
and now is haunting
her nightmares...

244
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:20,958
which, sidebar,

245
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,957
Dan is also a part of,

246
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,355
so things are heating up there.

247
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,910
Oh, well, that sure is nonsense.

248
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,634
Oh, don't worry.
The detective won't believe me.

249
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,160
See? It's classic us.

250
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,710
Look, I know
it sounds far-fetched,

251
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,395
and what Lucifer just said
is flat-out insane.

252
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,795
- Eh.
- Anyway,

253
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,720
if Forest killed someone
13 years ago,

254
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,594
the odds that he killed again
are not unrealistic.

255
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,555
Please, just look into it.

256
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,513
I will do what I always do,

257
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,599
which is investigate
everyone involved.

258
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,598
But until I get a new lead,

259
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,560
I will start with Forest.

260
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,319
Textbook, Detective.

261
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,840
Very good.

262
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,111
Brother, what are
you doing here?

263
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,755
Personally, I'm avoiding
the, uh, boring forensic part

264
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,110
of the case,
like I normally do.

265
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,515
But you don't day drink.

266
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,518
Something Charlotte
said made me think.

267
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,870
Oh.

268
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,957
Maybe celestial
beings and humans...

269
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,952
Luci, maybe they
aren't that different.

270
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,837
What, are we talking in bed?

271
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,673
'Cause we all know
my skills are preternatural.

272
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,030
But I suppose you,
on the other hand...

273
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,436
I'm talking about the rules
of Heaven and Hell, Luci.

274
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,438
It's all based on a
human's subconscious,

275
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,074
what they think they deserve.

276
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,872
What if that applies
to us as well?

277
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,634
Right. That's enough
for you, drunky.

278
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,599
No, listen.

279
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,559
When I first lost my wings,

280
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,120
I thought Dad was punishing me.

281
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,990
And then I thought
that you were somehow my test,

282
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,840
that in helping God's most
wayward soul, that I would

283
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,032
somehow find redemption.

284
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,471
But, Luci,
I've just been guessing.

285
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,239
Dad never told me any
of those things.

286
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,392
Since when does Dad
ever tell us anything?

287
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,592
That's exactly my point,
brother.

288
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,871
What if He wants us
to judge ourselves?

289
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,480
So my wings,
your wings,

290
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,909
your Devil face...

291
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,553
Brother, what if

292
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,480
we're the ones
who control all of it?

293
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,909
Brother,

294
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,158
that is
absolutely absurd.

295
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,671
Dad holds the reins.
End of story.

296
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,639
Because if we
do have control,

297
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,837
why don't you just pop
your wings out right now?

298
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,713
Hmm? Excuse me.

299
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,754
We might need some room here.
Go on. Be an angel.

300
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,632
Listen, I'm not sure.

301
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,638
I-I still haven't figured
that part out.

302
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,196
Well, I'd stop trying
if I were you. It's exhausting.

303
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,519
No, actually,
on second thoughts,

304
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,275
ponder needlessly, 'cause it's
what you normally do, isn't it?

305
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,234
No financial scandals,

306
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,994
no personal accusations.

307
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,795
The only nefarious thing Forest
ever did was steal a base.

308
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,440
This guy's as squeaky
clean as they come.

309
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,676
Well, someone is

310
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,195
a dirty little liar.

311
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,073
I was checking out
Forest's medical report,

312
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,839
and something didn't add up.

313
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,713
He said that the killer knocked
him out with a gun, right?

314
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,798
Yeah.

315
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,117
Well, bam!

316
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,557
Or should I say,

317
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,194
no bam?

318
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,752
Hmm?
If a cut

319
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,792
is caused by a blunt object,

320
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,560
there's a presence of tissue
bridging within the wound.

321
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,080
Plus, there'd be
pretty major bruising

322
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,277
if it was caused by something
that knocked him unconscious.

323
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,915
- But there was neither.
- So what caused the wound?

324
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,470
That right there, my friend,
is an incised cut

325
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,796
caused
by something sharp.

326
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,277
Bottom line,
Mr. Clay's nose

327
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,273
is as long as a Dodger Dog.

328
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,551
He lying.

329
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,392
Maybe Charlotte
is onto something.

330
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,794
Careful, Mr. Clay.

331
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,438
Physical activity may not
be wise after, you know,

332
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,431
being hit on the head.

333
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,909
Detective, hi.

334
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,031
What's this about?

335
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,311
Well, Forensics looked
through your medical report.

336
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,280
You weren't hit
with a gun.

337
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,159
Well, maybe I didn't
see it right.

338
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,914
It happened so fast.
Maybe it was...

339
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,873
Maybe I should just jump
to the old chestnut

340
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,351
where you tell me
what you desire.

341
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,157
I just don't want anyone
to find out.

342
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,555
What, that you killed your wife?

343
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,031
No, no, no. I...
Th-That I wasn't even there.

344
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,790
Ah.

345
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,159
The night of Devon's murder...

346
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,196
I was with someone else.

347
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,039
Ooh. A mistress.

348
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,996
What was her name?

349
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,113
Mia Hytner. I bartend at
the West Hills Country Club.

350
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,591
Okay. And is that
how you met Forest?

351
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,600
Yes. He came in a lot, even
though he hardly ever drinks.

352
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,194
- Ugh.
- Anyways,

353
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,476
before I knew it, we were...

354
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,000
Hitting a home run?

355
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,469
Digging into the dugout?

356
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,114
Slamming it out of the park?

357
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,876
So you confirm
that you

358
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,156
and Forest were having an affair

359
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,589
and that he was
at your apartment

360
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,120
the night
that Devon Clay was murdered?

361
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,714
- Yes.
- And how did he hurt

362
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,917
- his head?
- Things can get a little...

363
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,270
wild...

364
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,633
in bed with us sometimes.

365
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,350
That night,
Forest fell

366
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,550
onto the nightstand,

367
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,234
and he shattered the lamp.

368
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,119
That would explain the sharp
cut that Ella described.

369
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,834
Yes. And
furniture-breaking sex

370
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,760
doesn't exactly fit
with Forest's saintly image.

371
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,599
- And explain why he lied about it.
- Mm.

372
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,154
Try not to judge Forest

373
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,151
too harshly.

374
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,157
He wasn't the first

375
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,880
to cheat on his marriage.

376
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,759
He would never tell you this,

377
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,192
but Devon had been having an
affair with her CEO for years.

378
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,120
Was she, now?

379
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,713
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

380
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,797
Only one way to sneak up
on a demon:

381
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,839
let her think
she's sneaking up on you.

382
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,637
You see, I knew

383
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,116
it was only a matter of time
before you found my new digs.

384
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:12,952
Killing me

385
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,436
won't send you home.

386
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:16,991
Keep talking.

387
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,879
The only way you
can get to Hell

388
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,556
is if Lucifer flies you down.

389
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,591
And the only way he'll do that

390
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,995
is if we destroy his life
on Earth.

391
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,312
That's why framing Lucifer
for your murder

392
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,233
was the perfect plan.

393
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,114
Until you weaseled your way
out of it.

394
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,760
Well, I have a new plan.
Or, rather,

395
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,394
same plan, different victim.

396
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,274
Who's the new sacrificial lamb?

397
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,994
God's favorite son.

398
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,474
You want me
to kill Amenadiel?

399
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,477
Not exactly.

400
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,114
I want you to bring him to me.

401
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,232
Alive but weakened.

402
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,391
Throw me a soft pitch.

403
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,717
I'll kill him.

404
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,154
- You want your mark back.
- Exactly.

405
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,790
There's no better way
to piss off God

406
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,151
than killing his favorite
son. I get what I want.

407
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,953
Then we frame Lucifer,
and you get what you want.

408
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,078
- It's a win-win.
- Why do you need my help

409
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,634
if you're the one
who has to do the killing?

410
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,991
Well, Amenadiel's angelic powers
might be gone,

411
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,317
but he still managed to kill me
nine times when we fought.

412
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,318
Now that I'm mortal...

413
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,556
there's no do-overs.

414
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,037
I mean, come on,
you're a demon.

415
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,072
He's an angel.
This is what you do.

416
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,791
Unless your time on Earth
changed you more than I thought

417
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,832
and you're not the merciless
badass you used to be.

418
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,835
Nothing's changed.

419
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,477
I'm in.

420
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,912
Devon was the heart
and soul of King Clay.

421
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,794
I can't tell you
how hard it's been.

422
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,713
Emphasis on the "hard."

423
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,519
- Excuse me?
- We have reason to believe

424
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,837
that you were having an affair
with Devon Clay.

425
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,951
That's crazy.

426
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,116
Look, I get it.

427
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,515
Being with a married woman,

428
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,154
knowing she could
never leave her husband

429
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,352
because of some
stupid company,

430
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,755
his giant face
staring down

431
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,679
at you all day.
I mean, it can be torture

432
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,872
working side by side with somebody
that you have feelings for.

433
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,959
Especially if you have to deny
those feelings, squash 'em.

434
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,559
You know, it can
be unbearable.

435
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,989
Yeah.

436
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,634
It sounds awful.

437
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,998
But that was not the situation
with me and Devon.

438
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,237
We were just putting in a
lot of hours at the office.

439
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,272
We have to hit the shelves
before the knockoffs do.

440
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,352
Corporate espionage
is a real thing.

441
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,597
Actually caught a spy casing
this place just the other day.

442
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,553
Really? Did you press charges?

443
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,876
Unfortunately, no.
He ran off

444
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,918
- when security approached him.
- Did it occur to you

445
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,316
that he might be stalking
Devon and not your sneakers?

446
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,120
No, God.
Do you think...

447
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,391
I think I'm gonna need to see
all of your security footage.

448
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,280
Yeah. Right this way.

449
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,315
Dr. Canaan.

450
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:46,917
Pleasure.

451
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,600
My office is right this way.

452
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,075
I really hope you
understand just how grave

453
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,920
- the incident was.
- You're in experienced hands.

454
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,552
The firm handles cases like this
all the time.

455
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,837
Really?

456
00:18:59,400 --> 00:18:59,992
Oh, yeah.

457
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,994
How many cases of misdiagnosed
chlamydia are there?

458
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,631
You'd be... surprised?

459
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,956
I'm not
going anywhere.

460
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,874
- Get out of my way.
- Excuse me one moment.

461
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,389
Not until I talk
to Wheeler!

462
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,272
Ben!

463
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,870
Charlotte, what-what's going on?

464
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:14,997
When I left this firm,

465
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,395
you asked me why.

466
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,477
The truth?

467
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,194
It's because I found out

468
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,950
that there are real consequences
to what you're doing here,

469
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,078
what <i>we</i> did here.

470
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,634
You tell yourself

471
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,311
that you're defending
the innocent,

472
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,192
upholding some oath,
but you're pretending.

473
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,070
All of you.

474
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,389
Everything you conceal,
every lie you tell,

475
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,793
it adds up.

476
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,950
You're just as guilty

477
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,431
as the criminals
that you represent.

478
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,155
Hell is real.

479
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,354
And, trust me,
all of you are going.

480
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,509
You need help, Charlotte.

481
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,160
And so do I.

482
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,874
Where the hell
is security?

483
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,790
Thank God.

484
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,390
I don't think
God's on your side, Ben.

485
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,114
It may be too
late for us,

486
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,199
but at least
I'm trying to fix things.

487
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,917
Maybe you can try, too.

488
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,037
Oh.

489
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,556
My apologies for
the interruption, Dr. Canaan.

490
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,316
Shall we continue?

491
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,553
Oh, I'm sorry, but I don't think
this is the firm for me.

492
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,796
Old password still good?

493
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,390
Sure is.

494
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,631
Got him.

495
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,071
Four separate times,
as a matter of fact.

496
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,556
But our facial recognition
software's coming up with squat

497
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,194
because of his hat
and sunglasses.

498
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,997
Average height,

499
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,157
average build,
no visible scars or tattoos.

500
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,993
I mean, even his shoes
are so boring.

501
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,835
- Mm, no wonder he's stealing sneaker secrets.
- I'll go back

502
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,838
over the footage tonight.
Maybe we missed something.

503
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,840
You Dan Espinoza?

504
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,474
How dare you.

505
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,273
Hey, hey. Actually,
uh, that's for me.

506
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:11,912
Whew.

507
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,710
- Ah. Well, this is like old times, isn't it?
- Thanks.

508
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,320
Let me guess,
human head or bomb?

509
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,516
Wager, anyone?

510
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,551
Funny.

511
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,877
No. This is

512
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:21,831
for...

513
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,236
Charlotte.

514
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,036
Ta-da!

515
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,191
It's a waffle maker.

516
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,871
see,

517
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,594
I-I make waffles.

518
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,679
And hers...
uh, iron is really old.

519
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,593
I'm, like, the waffle king?

520
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,558
- Is it weird?
- Very. But I'm glad

521
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,269
to see you're back to your
normal douchey ways, Daniel.

522
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,358
Well, it's between that and...

523
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,631
this.

524
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,391
That's pretty.

525
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,314
- It's a waffle.
- Oh.

526
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,159
- That's better, right?
- It's still weird,

527
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,079
but yes, women tend
to prefer jewelry

528
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,714
over household appliances.

529
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,516
Not really
sure Lucifer's

530
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,359
the authority
on what women want.

531
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,513
This is amazing. See this?

532
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,354
These are
nondisclosure agreements.

533
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,120
Forest Clay and...

534
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,874
14 different women.

535
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,470
Spanning two decades...
the last, Mia Hytner,

536
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,029
barely a week ago.

537
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,954
How does this prove that
Forest is the killer, though?

538
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,080
Well, 300, 400 grand a pop...
I mean, no one spends

539
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,039
that kind of money unless
they're trying to cover up

540
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,350
something really bad.

541
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:30,918
Wait.

542
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,910
Joanne Foles.

543
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,271
June 22, 2005.
That's right around the time

544
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,836
I got rid of the duffel bag.
I remember.

545
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,436
"24-year-old
found strangled in a motel."

546
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,912
No way the timing
is coincidence.

547
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,952
Forest killed that woman,
and the proof of it

548
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,230
- was in that duffel bag.
- Yeah,

549
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,193
but not even one mention
of Forest here.

550
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,234
Yeah, you're right.
I may know that Forest did it,

551
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,751
- but I still can't prove it because of what <i>I</i> did.
- Hey, at least

552
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,236
we have the victim's name now...
maybe that's gonna lead us

553
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,710
to some other proof.

554
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,754
Tiny victories, remember?

555
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,394
- Hey.
- Dan.

556
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,757
I can come back.

557
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,360
No, no.
I should get going.

558
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,872
Thank you.

559
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,437
Hi.

560
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,637
Maze.

561
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,793
What are you doing here?
What's wrong?

562
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,675
Everything.

563
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,189
It's all ruined.

564
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,233
I have no one,
Amenadiel.

565
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,111
And I don't know
how that happened.

566
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,156
Maze, I don't know what
you've been going through,

567
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,193
but it is never too late

568
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,720
to fix things.

569
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:04,952
You can always

570
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,516
be forgiven... that <i>is</i> in your hands.

571
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,796
And, um...

572
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,719
well, for what it's worth,

573
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,072
I will always be
here for you.

574
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,560
Hello.

575
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,036
Hi, Lucifer!

576
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,392
Oh, perfect... you're
exactly where you need to be.

577
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,956
Who is up
for a classic game night, hmm?

578
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,277
Well, actually,
it's a school night for her,

579
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,709
and I was just about to go over

580
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,991
- the King Clay security footage.
- Remember, all work

581
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,040
and no play makes
the detective... a shoe.

582
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:42,997
- Lucifer?
- Hmm?

583
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,600
This is... this is
a little weird.

584
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,359
Well, if by "weird,"
you mean you're transported

585
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,075
to a simpler, happier time,
then agreed.

586
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,836
Uh, no, no, no, I'm afraid
that won't do... you landed

587
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,430
on the little question mark
last time, so come on, do over.

588
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,558
Mom's right, this <i>is</i> weird...
we can't play

589
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,116
the exact same game
as we did before, Lucifer.

590
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,717
It's not fun.

591
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,831
Isn't it?

592
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,071
Sorry, but...

593
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,840
I should finish
my book report.

594
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,840
Yes, and <i>I</i> should
get back to work.

595
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,874
- But don't you want to paint a unicorn on my cheek?
- Ugh.

596
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,957
Well, hold on, wait.

597
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,793
- Um...
- There we go.

598
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,359
- Okay. What?
- Come here. Come here.

599
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,198
Lucifer!

600
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,675
What are you doing?

601
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,431
Here we go.

602
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,876
Wait.

603
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,514
Lucifer, stop.

604
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,680
You liked this before,
didn't you?

605
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,272
Yes. I did.

606
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,311
It...

607
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,197
it meant a lot to me, actually,

608
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,359
which is why I don't understand
why you're doing this.

609
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,352
Are you making fun of us?

610
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,509
No. No, I'm trying to remind us
of how great we are together,

611
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,949
to help us get back to normal.

612
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,630
Right.

613
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,954
Well, uh, you know,
I thought I wanted that, too,

614
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:56,917
but...

615
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,836
maybe we can't.

616
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,918
Or at least maybe <i>I</i> can't.

617
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,389
Look...

618
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,437
right now,

619
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,711
normal, it just hurts.

620
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,831
Detective...

621
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,394
I-I think you should go.

622
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,550
Hey, I got something.

623
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,236
- You do?
- Yeah.

624
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,556
Okay, I cross-referenced

625
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,194
the times the suspect
went to King Clay

626
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,516
with Devon's schedule.

627
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,155
Two of the four days,
Devon wasn't even there.

628
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,675
But guess who was.

629
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,839
- Forest Clay?
- All four times

630
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,396
the skulker was there...
right on Forest's heels.

631
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,395
So what if Forest was
the intended target all along?

632
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,479
What if, what if Devon
just got shot by mistake?

633
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,310
Wow.

634
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,352
That is a great theory.

635
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,276
- Yeah.
- Uh, are you okay?

636
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,436
Yeah.

637
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,678
Yeah.

638
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,392
Well, I...
I couldn't sleep last night,

639
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,512
so I stayed up all night
working, and, you know,

640
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,996
I drank a lot of caffeine.
Like, a lot.

641
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,353
Was it because of Pierce?

642
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,151
No.

643
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,351
No. I... I don't think
any of this

644
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,353
is really about Pierce.

645
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,749
I think if I'm honest
with myself...

646
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,196
all of this is about Lucifer.

647
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,677
Lucifer's the...
the reason

648
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,639
that I said yes
to Pierce, and...

649
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,311
he's also the reason
that I said no.

650
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,759
<i>Wow,</i> again.

651
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,791
I'm just so sorry
that I got wrapped up

652
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,111
in the whole idea
of beautiful "Pecker" babies

653
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,596
that I forgot
to check in with you.

654
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,719
Like... like,
<i>really</i> check in with you.

655
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,155
- Ella, it's okay.
- Tell me

656
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,840
what I can do for you right now.

657
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,157
Uh, you can help me
focus on work.

658
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,716
- You got it.
- Okay.

659
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:48,199
So, if Forest was the
killer's actual target,

660
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,312
what's the motive?

661
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,756
I think I know.

662
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,679
That's A.J. Agholor.

663
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,635
In 2005, he went to jail

664
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,990
for the murder of Joanne Foles.

665
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,190
But A.J.
didn't do it.

666
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,558
Forest did.
A.J.'s motive was revenge.

667
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,989
How did you figure
all of this out?

668
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,631
This is a list of women that Forest
paid off for the last 20 years.

669
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,957
And look.

670
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:12,513
Joanne signed
a $300,000 NDA on June 22.

671
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,479
She was killed
on June 25,

672
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,956
- the same night I got the bag.
- Charlotte,

673
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,514
this could all be a
bunch of coincidences,

674
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,632
especially to a jury full
of Forest Clay fans.

675
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,349
Yes, but a lot of coincidences
is a pattern.

676
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:24,871
And here's the kicker.

677
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,955
A.J. got out of prison
just three weeks ago.

678
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,194
Motive and opportunity.

679
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,478
It all fits.

680
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,319
All right.
We got to find this guy.

681
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,231
Where's Amenadiel?

682
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,559
I decided you were wrong.

683
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,151
Killing Amenadiel won't
get your mark back.

684
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,636
God isn't a drive-thru...

685
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,991
you can't just order
what you want.

686
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,991
No.

687
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,320
You chickened out.
Gone soft, like I thought.

688
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,080
Know what?
I'll do it myself.

689
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,910
Where do you think
you're going?

690
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,359
How's that for soft?

691
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,432
We found this
in your car, A.J.

692
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,519
It matches the casing that was
found next to Devon Clay's body.

693
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,037
Now, I don't think you
meant to kill Devon.

694
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,758
I don't. I think that you
were following Forest for weeks,

695
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,271
you broke into his house when you knew
he'd be home alone, only he wasn't...

696
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,119
Devon surprised you.
You panicked,

697
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,356
and you shot her.

698
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,230
You've been in prison
for 13 years

699
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,511
for a crime you
didn't commit.

700
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,237
It's understandable that
you would want revenge.

701
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,479
Yeah. But not for me.

702
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,676
For Joanie.

703
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,351
We were gonna get married.
She broke it off.

704
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,034
- For Forest?
- Yeah.

705
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,596
Only she didn't tell me
that was his name back then.

706
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,911
She was too scared.

707
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,758
Scared?

708
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,800
He used to hurt her.

709
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,119
She said she
was gonna leave him.

710
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,031
Then one night,
she calls me crying, screaming.

711
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,400
Next thing I knew,
I'm going down for murder.

712
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,115
- When did you find out that it was Forest?
- When I got out of jail,

713
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,993
I went to go see Joanie's mom.

714
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,631
She told me that's who Joanie
was dating when she died.

715
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,234
Did she, or you,
have any proof?

716
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,551
Mm-mm.

717
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,632
Damn.

718
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,109
More hearsay.

719
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,829
Ah, Charlotte.

720
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,391
Who's that?

721
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,349
He killed Devon Clay.

722
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,951
Long story.

723
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,037
So the detective
caught the bad guy.

724
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,711
Without me.

725
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,070
All right, thank you.

726
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,398
Yeah, he's not the
<i>real</i> bad guy.

727
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,317
Thank you.

728
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,113
I know you're gonna say
there's still no proof.

729
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,640
No, I wanted to
say thank you.

730
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,920
Thank you for helping
me solve this case.

731
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,834
And I might have an idea
of how to solve yours.

732
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,596
Okay. Time out. Time out.

733
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,951
Geez. I won't
go after Amenadiel.

734
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,631
- You won't?
- You're probably right... it wouldn't work anyway.

735
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,030
I <i>had</i> to kill you before,
but now I just <i>want</i> to.

736
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,960
Okay, you could kill me, sure,
but Linda would die, too.

737
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,516
- You're full of it.
- Maybe I knew you weren't gonna follow through,

738
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,750
so I needed a fail-safe.

739
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,077
Liar!

740
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,079
Call her. Tell her
to look out her window.

741
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:08,997
Now I'm...

742
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,752
really gonna kill you.

743
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,520
Hey, get me a beer, will ya?

744
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,196
Hello, Forest.

745
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,153
Charlotte Richards,
what are you doing here?

746
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,352
Oh, I just stopped by
to tell you

747
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,716
that I know
about everything.

748
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,558
<i>Everyone,</i> actually.

749
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,113
Stephanie,
Diane, Jaylyn...

750
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,556
about every woman
that you abused

751
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,716
and then paid off.

752
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,877
Most recently,
Mia, of course.

753
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,590
She told me how
you actually got

754
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,280
that cut on your head.

755
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,960
I told her how you
were getting rough again.

756
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,672
How you started
to strangle me.

757
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,238
I tried to get you to
stop, but you wouldn't.

758
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,794
So I pushed you.

759
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,673
And you hit your head
against the lamp.

760
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,800
How much do you want?

761
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,751
Money?

762
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,719
Well, a pattern
of domestic abuse

763
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,957
going back decades
is pretty bad.

764
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,916
But murder?

765
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,079
Whew, let's see,
carry the one...

766
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,270
Yeah, all of it.

767
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,318
Murder? What are you
talking about?

768
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,638
Joanne Foles.
Ring a bell?

769
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,077
You can stop
pretending, Forest.

770
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,390
Cat's out of the bag.

771
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,832
Or rather, the
bloody duffel bag.

772
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,320
Yeah, you remember giving
that to Ben Sr., right?

773
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,759
Well, see, hmm,

774
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,038
he gave it to his young

775
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,870
and hungry first-year
associate: me.

776
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,393
And here's the
thing, I kept it.

777
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,876
I thought it might
come in handy someday.

778
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,277
I'll get my check book.

779
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,437
Turns out
I'm a pretty smart lady.

780
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,436
Not that smart.

781
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,919
Knock, knock.
It's Lucifer.

782
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,799
Come to save the day.

783
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,474
Everybody stay calm.

784
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,516
Just get back
and I mean it.

785
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,517
I mean it!

786
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,676
Forest, let her go.

787
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,239
Hey, I didn't mean
to kill Joanie.

788
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,557
It was an accident.

789
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,753
I'm sick. I need your help.

790
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,351
Thanks for your help.

791
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,194
I am not gonna help you
this time.

792
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,038
Hands up.

793
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,560
Let her go, Forest.

794
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,758
Was that enough of a confession,
Detective?

795
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,394
Yes. We recorded everything.

796
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,349
It's over, Forest.

797
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,470
Let her go.

798
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,637
Turn around.

799
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,870
Wow.

800
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,394
It's a good place
to celebrate.

801
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,869
Yes, it is.

802
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,112
I have been coming here
ever since I realized

803
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,551
that this may
be the closest

804
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,353
to Heaven that
I'll ever get.

805
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,676
Hmm.

806
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,390
Me, too.

807
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,636
You know, I've been
telling myself

808
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,070
that I've been
doing God's work.

809
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,676
But, uh, if I'm honest...

810
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,796
I think I've been
doing it all for myself.

811
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,193
To get my Father
to give me my wings back.

812
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,989
But you know something,
Charlotte? I think, uh...

813
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,354
I think I'm the one
who took my wings away.

814
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,430
Great. We're both broken.

815
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,394
Yeah.

816
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,951
Well, I guess angels really are
just as flawed as humans,

817
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,234
or at least I am.

818
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,000
Hey, at least
we have each other.

819
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,557
Tiny victories, right?

820
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,117
Tiny?

821
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,595
Uh, may I point out

822
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,957
that you just stopped
a serial abuser?

823
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:24,997
A murderer.

824
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,000
Yeah, but that
doesn't change the fact

825
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,756
that he hurt
a lot of women.

826
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,351
No.

827
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,634
But because of you...

828
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,118
he will never hurt
anyone ever again.

829
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,400
And I'm pretty sure
that you didn't do that

830
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,037
just for yourself,
did you?

831
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,596
Maybe not.

832
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,800
Well done, Detective.

833
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,309
And, uh, point taken.

834
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,397
What do you mean?

835
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,160
Well, you put away not one,
but two bad guys today.

836
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,436
All without my help.

837
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,394
So it's become very
clear that you...

838
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,715
well, you don't need me.

839
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,760
That's okay, Detective,

840
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,599
because with
that realization

841
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,351
came another.

842
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:55,958
Hmm.

843
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,799
If you don't need me,

844
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,236
then we've been
working together

845
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,352
all this time
because you want to.

846
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,916
Because you choose to.

847
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,800
You did choose me.

848
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,670
You were right.

849
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,552
I've been trying to go back
to the way things were.

850
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,353
You know, playing
our greatest hits,

851
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,831
because I've been
avoiding dealing

852
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,838
with things in
the present like...

853
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,514
how I feel about you.

854
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,236
I was afraid.

855
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,551
Afraid...

856
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,559
that you'd want me 'cause you've
only seen certain sides of me.

857
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,995
That if you saw
all of me...

858
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,750
<i>knew</i> all of me,

859
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,390
you would run away.

860
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,671
Lucifer.

861
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,071
- Detective, it's true.
- No.

862
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,115
The other side of
me is... it's bad.

863
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,830
It's monstrous, even.

864
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,719
But you wanted the truth,
and you deserve the truth.

865
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,240
Right now, I can't
show it to you,

866
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,551
so I'm just gonna
have to tell you.

867
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,560
Detective...

868
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,670
Chloe...

869
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,958
I am the Devil.

870
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,320
No, you're not.

871
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,355
Not to me.

872
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,558
Oh. Oh.

873
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:41,998
Let me turn this off.

874
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,111
Right.

875
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,670
Oh.

876
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,156
Oh, it's...

877
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,194
I'm so sorry.
I have to take this.

878
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,516
Of course, no.

879
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,357
Yeah.

880
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,874
Detective, what's wrong?

881
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,639
Hey, just hold on, Charlotte.

882
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,714
I'm, uh, I'm gonna get help.

883
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,436
I already
survived death once.

884
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,997
I think twice is asking
too... too much.

885
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,000
No. You're gonna be okay.

886
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,800
Why did you do that?

887
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,710
Why did you jump in
front of me like that?

888
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,360
