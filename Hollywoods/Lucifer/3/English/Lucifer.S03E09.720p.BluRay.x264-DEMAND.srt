1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,999
<i>- Previously on</i> Lucifer...
- He is so into you.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,554
- You're joking.
- Uh, no.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,400
Scorching fire, five-alarm.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,751
I can see why Lucifer
is so affected by you.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,758
It's because you're
special, Decker.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,914
Being a celestial insider...

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,389
really sucks.

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,559
I was in a really
dark place, but someone

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,910
<i>helped me gain perspective.</i>

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,720
<i>NowMazeisoff
bounty hunting again.</i>

11
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,792
Being good takes practice.

12
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,236
Keep at it
and you'll get better.

13
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,033
I guess I should
take that job then.

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,471
- What job?
- The Sinnerman is not a myth.

15
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,235
I butted heads with him in
Chicago. Did not end well.

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,909
<i>Not only did he stick my
wings back on and take my face,</i>

17
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,713
<i>he's stolen my shtick,
as well.</i>

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,070
He gives out favors to people.

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,600
<i>And I think that maybe</i>

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,792
<i>it's about time
I got back in the game.</i>

21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,360
Line's back there, buddy.

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,272
Is the, uh,

23
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,950
big guy in tonight?

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,551
This is a one.

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,473
Nice guy discount?

26
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,996
Make it quick, kid.

27
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,030
You're a prince.

28
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,996
Thank you.

29
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,918
Hey.

30
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,793
Uh, Mr. Morningstar?

31
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,395
I hear you're the guy
to talk to.

32
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,630
I hear you help people.

33
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,354
What, like Ellen?

34
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,791
I think not.

35
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,713
No, I grant people favors.

36
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,070
When it suits me.

37
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,792
Well, I-I could use a favor.

38
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,358
Hear me out, Mr. Morningstar.

39
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,677
You won't regret it.

40
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,836
Victoria, give us a minute,
would you, girl?

41
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,677
Call me Lucifer.

42
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,476
Joey Pileggi.

43
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,194
So, Joey Pileggi,

44
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,274
what is it you desire?

45
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,432
<i>Okay, so,
how do zou angels work?</i>

46
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,471
I know Amenadiel
can slow time,

47
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,792
and your other brother Uriel
could predict patterns.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,356
So why is your
gift desire?

49
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,193
Well,

50
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,397
that's a good question,
actually, I suppose.

51
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,194
When I first went
to angel school,

52
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,558
they sorted us into different
houses for different powers.

53
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,989
There's a school for angels?

54
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,272
No.

55
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,712
There's no Hogwarts in the sky.

56
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,196
Right. Obviously.

57
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,391
Are you using humor to deflect
my very reasonable question?

58
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,110
Look, if you must know,

59
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,277
we were all born this way,

60
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,915
each with our own
God-given abilities.

61
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,310
But what came first?

62
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,640
Do angels' powers shape
their personalities?

63
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,753
Or are your personalities
shaped by your powers?

64
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,517
Haven't a clue.

65
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,590
Look, all I know is that
my powers are perfect for me.

66
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,871
Desire is the ultimate
expression of free will.

67
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,437
I help people do whatever...
or whomever... they want.

68
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,710
But that's it?

69
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,234
There isn't more to it?

70
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,270
Sorry.

71
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,995
- I-I should have knocked.
- It's a late night.

72
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,190
Been trying to catch up
on all the work

73
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,880
since I got out
of the hospital.

74
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,073
Stole a couple hours
on the couch.

75
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,829
Um, thank you again...

76
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,520
for saving my life.

77
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,635
It's, uh...

78
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,513
Looks like you're,
you're healing really well.

79
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,837
It still hurts
like a son of a bitch.

80
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,716
You know what? I'll, um...

81
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,036
I'll just come back
another time.

82
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,839
Now's good. What do
you want, Decker?

83
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,914
Uh, I wanted to request
a personal day.

84
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,391
What for?

85
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,636
Well, it's personal.

86
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,916
I'll take it under advisement.

87
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,713
I didn't think
it'd be an issue.

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,275
<i>It's just one personal day.</i>

89
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,199
I never ask for anything.

90
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,754
You're too low-
maintenance, Detective.

91
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,872
People assume work
is your only desire.

92
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,516
Yeah, well, it's not.

93
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,790
Yeah, what a jerk.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,400
Oh, look who's all
hot and bothered.

95
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,193
Someone got under
your skin.

96
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,511
What do you want
with a personal day anyway?

97
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,474
It's personal.

98
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,513
Looks like some sort of
poor man's penthouse, isn't it?

99
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,035
Hmm.

100
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,670
Boy, he's young.

101
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,393
- Practically a kid.
- Yeah.

102
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,958
What happened here?
Who would have done this?

103
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,190
I'm afraid I might know.

104
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,676
You see, I did
this young man a favor.

105
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,992
Lucifer, can I talk to you?

106
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,430
What exactly does this
have to do with you?

107
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,634
Well, his name's Joey.

108
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,797
Joey Pileggi, he came
to me a few months ago

109
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,753
and asked me for a favor,
and I granted it to him.

110
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,919
You're still doing that?

111
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,550
I'd never stop
granting favors, Detective.

112
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,952
I mean, I may have gotten
distracted for a while,

113
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,231
but then I realized
granting favors defines me.

114
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,477
I mean, you wouldn't ask
Superman not to fly?

115
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,909
A Kardashian
not to selfie?

116
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,919
So I started up again and it was
going splendidly, until...

117
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,158
What kind of favor? And don't
tell me it got Joey killed.

118
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,279
Well, his desire was to become
the new Godfather,

119
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,795
a Scarface for millennials.

120
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,270
You introduced him to the mob?

121
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,591
I may have gotten him
an internship.

122
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,158
Ella.

123
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,800
What do you have
on the cause of death?

124
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,480
Two gunshot wounds
to the chest,

125
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,035
<i>and</i> his legs were broken.

126
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,555
Practically shattered.

127
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,355
But here's the weird part.
I thought that the killer

128
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,199
broke Joey's legs first...
you know, torturing him

129
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,800
before killing him...
but look.

130
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,436
Minimal hemorrhaging.

131
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,990
That's when I realized

132
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,157
Joey's legs were
broken postmortem.

133
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,240
Why? What's the killer
trying to say?

134
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,476
Oh, no.

135
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,871
What?

136
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,757
Well, it may be a commentary
on the job that I got for him.

137
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,194
As a runner for the mob.

138
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,834
- Angel school?
- Okay, what?

139
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,235
It's not that funny, okay.

140
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,315
Okay. Okay, it's
kind of funny.

141
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,956
You really thought
angel school was a thing?

142
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,674
How was I supposed to know?

143
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,870
What's crazier,

144
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,555
angel school, or that
you can slow time,

145
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,316
or that Lucifer can draw
out people's desires?

146
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,239
Okay, I can see how
that would seem strange.

147
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,000
No, it's bananas,
Amenadiel.

148
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,839
I mean, how does
any of it all work?

149
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:27,997
Like...

150
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,669
why is <i>your</i> power
slowing down time?

151
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,351
Maybe my Father wanted me
to be a better emissary,

152
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,632
someone who could
fix things on Earth

153
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,069
and stay invisible.

154
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,878
So, I can slow down time
and do His bidding

155
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,639
without anyone being the wiser.

156
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,834
That seems really...

157
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,357
sad.

158
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,910
- What do you mean?
- I mean,

159
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,356
it... it just seems lonely

160
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,197
to visit humanity without ever
really getting to know anyone.

161
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,189
I guess I was never told
to <i>avoid</i> humanity.

162
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,110
It just seemed easier.

163
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,278
And quite honestly,
I never saw the point.

164
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,550
Until recently.

165
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,391
Hey, stranger...

166
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,232
Maze!

167
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,999
- You're back!
- Yeah!

168
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,120
Oh, I missed you,
too, girl.

169
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,640
Where was your bounty
this time, Mazikeen?

170
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,637
Uh, Cleveland.

171
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,638
Now I'm
banned in Ohio.

172
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,877
- Ah.
- So, uh, what's going on?

173
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,036
What are you
guys up to?

174
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,995
Okay. Well, Linda...

175
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,120
Linda was just catching me up
on how sh...

176
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,711
On how she believed
in "angel school."

177
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,673
Oh.

178
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,954
You... guys
catch up, huh?

179
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,391
Yes. Yeah, we...
we've been hanging out.

180
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,796
Yeah, we're friends.

181
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,117
Right.

182
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,354
Right. Friends.

183
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,639
It's not
just <i>any</i> shoe.

184
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,911
Joey's high-tops were
limited edition.

185
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,952
Easily worth
a grand a pair.

186
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,879
I mean, my brothers
would flip over these.

187
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,355
Sweet kicks indeed.

188
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,836
Sorry I'm late.

189
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,397
Charlotte.

190
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,317
What are you
doing here?

191
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,954
Little early for
opposing counsel.

192
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,991
Are you defending
someone?

193
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,271
No.

194
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,797
I quit my job.

195
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,312
Oh. Well, good for you,
Charlotte.

196
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,158
Had enough of life

197
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,840
as a corrupt defense
lawyer, have you?

198
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,630
That'll help keep
your ledger clear.

199
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,595
Today is my first day in the
district attorney's office...

200
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,551
as a prosecutor.

201
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,989
I'm on your side now.

202
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,554
Surprise.

203
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,836
Did you know about this?

204
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,872
- Not a clue.
- How did this happen?

205
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,719
Who knows
how these things happen?

206
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,071
So random.

207
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,314
Guess we should get back
to the case, right?

208
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,914
- Right.
- Right.

209
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,551
So, Joey had expensive shoes,

210
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,032
plus...

211
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,640
a real Rolex

212
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,477
and ten grand stashed
under his bed.

213
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,750
But Joey worked for the mob.
I mean,

214
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,394
wouldn't that explain
all the swag?

215
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,239
Runners for the mob
don't make that kind of money.

216
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,669
There's no way
he could afford that.

217
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,233
Maybe Joey was skimming
off the top.

218
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,120
No, you don't have to
raise your hand.

219
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,630
Okay, well, um, his bosses
wouldn't like that.

220
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,510
They would
execute Joey

221
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,120
to send a message to
the whole organization.

222
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,198
Whoever brought him in
would do the deed.

223
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,837
Lovely.

224
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,840
What? I know
how these guys work.

225
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,077
I've represented mobsters
like this for years.

226
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,353
<i>Alleged</i> mobsters.

227
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,311
Who did you
introduce Joey to?

228
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,791
Frankie the Knife.
Sweet chap.

229
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,036
Sounds like
a peach.

230
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,230
All right,
let's bring in Frankie

231
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,199
and see where
Joey's education went wrong.

232
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,430
Right.

233
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,920
<i>Okay, that was weird.</i>

234
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,076
Is it...

235
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,037
weird for...

236
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,600
us to be friends?

237
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,631
No.

238
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,076
Of course not.

239
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,876
I mean, can't a...

240
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,713
Can't a woman
be friends with a...

241
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,829
with a brilliant,

242
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,116
tall,

243
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,954
gorgeous angel?

244
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,955
Well, can't an angel
be friends with a...

245
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,359
amazing, accomplished...

246
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,080
...beautiful,

247
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,154
and passionate woman?

248
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,517
Um...

249
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,195
I can't.

250
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,720
This is a mistake.

251
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,636
Okay.

252
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,790
Okay.

253
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,791
Okay. I'm so sorry, Linda.

254
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,271
Detective, Lucifer.
Are you about to talk

255
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,954
- to Frankie the Knife?
- Yep.

256
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,640
Well, I can help. I know him.

257
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,950
I defended him once.

258
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,350
Unknown caller?

259
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,557
Um...

260
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,796
Look, why don't you give
the newbie a shot, Detective.

261
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,117
I mean, I for one would love an
audience when I ream Frankie

262
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:02,998
for what he did.

263
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,799
No one will be reaming anyone.

264
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,751
Fine, Charlotte.

265
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,280
Just keep a low profile.

266
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,596
You won't even know I'm there.

267
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,395
Hello, Frankie.

268
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,511
Mr. Ferrante.
I'm Detective Decker.

269
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,753
We know each other quite
well, don't we, Frankie?

270
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,480
Not sure we've met, buddy.

271
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,955
Oh, please.

272
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,117
- And this is...
- Charlotte Richards?

273
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,880
How are you?
How are the kids?

274
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,311
Hi, Frankie.

275
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,955
Man, the guys
are sure gonna be jealous

276
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,355
when they hear
you're defending me.

277
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,000
Look, Frankie,
I'm not your lawyer.

278
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,680
I'm the prosecutor.

279
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,075
I work with
the cops now.

280
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,430
Against you.

281
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,154
What's the world coming to?

282
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,471
Yeah, tell me about it.

283
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,716
What
happened, Frankie?

284
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,993
You were supposed to
mentor Joey Pileggi,

285
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,991
not kill him.

286
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,720
I got no idea about any killing.

287
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,315
Oh, did
Joey steal from you,

288
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,954
so you made
a brutal example of him?

289
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,316
Well, guess what?

290
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,716
I love making brutal
examples of people.

291
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,236
Like I said,

292
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,511
I don't know any Joey,
and I don't know you.

293
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,390
You do know him.

294
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,156
Yeah, I might've seen him once.

295
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,510
It's hard to say.

296
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,595
Is it true you're the head
of the Ferrante mob family?

297
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,072
Well, come on.

298
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,590
- Answer her.
- You do not need to answer that.

299
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,631
I don't?

300
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,871
But it would be helpful
if you did.

301
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,673
Right. Enough of this
"bad cop, worse cop."

302
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,473
Tell me, Frankie.

303
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,080
What is it you really want?

304
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,072
I want to find out
who killed little Joey,

305
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,120
and I want payback.

306
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,277
Oh.

307
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,110
He was...

308
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,280
He was such a good kid,
that Joey.

309
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,110
A real go-getter.

310
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,119
We all loved him.
He had a real bright future.

311
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,472
We found quite a bit
of contraband on him.

312
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,872
Did he ever steal anything
from you?

313
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,675
Joey? Never.

314
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,599
Everything he had
he got from us.

315
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,996
Oh, quite the lavish employers,
aren't you?

316
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,115
Hey, me and the fellas, we're
real generous to our family.

317
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,514
'Cause that's
who he was: family.

318
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,233
If there's anything I can do
to help with Joey's killer,

319
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,756
you let me know, 'cause I would
love to bring him in.

320
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,835
That means he would kill him.

321
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,274
Oh, thank you, Charlotte.

322
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,870
Thanks.

323
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,800
- Hey, Chloe?
- Yes.

324
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,120
I don't think
Frankie's our guy.

325
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,470
His alibi checks out.

326
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,000
Look what just came in.

327
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,875
Lucifer.

328
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,436
We got another body.

329
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,030
Let's go.

330
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,795
Double tap to the chest,
just like Joey.

331
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,996
Detective, I know
this woman.

332
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,358
What?

333
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,957
I did her a favor,
too, years ago.

334
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,310
This isn't just a murder.
It's another message.

335
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,116
For me.

336
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,315
Someone was definitely
sending a message.

337
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,279
Frieda Marquez, 36.

338
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,836
The noose was made
out of her own hair.

339
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,074
How twisted is that?

340
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,272
But hanging wasn't
what killed her.

341
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,239
She died from two
gunshots to the chest.

342
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,479
So the killer arranged her
after he killed her,

343
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,471
just like with Joey.

344
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:16,952
We need
to find the man

345
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,310
who did this
and punish him.

346
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,996
Lucifer, what
do you know about her?

347
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,237
Frieda wanted to become a
hairstylist to the stars,

348
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,518
so I made a few choice
introductions, that's all.

349
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,271
I can't believe you knew Frieda.

350
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,153
Her hair products are huge.

351
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,073
She had salons
all over the city,

352
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,800
a whole beauty empire.

353
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,480
I use her finishing
cream every day.

354
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,116
Right. Well, then I guess
she got what she wanted.

355
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,197
Until now.

356
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,436
Thanks, Ella.

357
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,120
Can I talk to you?

358
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,075
If these messages really are
for you, I'm worried.

359
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,351
Who's sending them?

360
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,789
What are they trying to say?

361
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,595
Detective, I wasn't
entirely forthcoming earlier.

362
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,751
The real reason I started
granting favors again

363
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,435
was because of the Sinnerman.

364
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,793
Lucifer,
I've told you this before,

365
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,719
I haven't seen any shred
of evidence

366
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,320
that this guy really exists.

367
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,313
Well, now might be the time
to become a believer,

368
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,200
because this appears to be his
way of escalating our rivalry.

369
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,074
You think this is the same guy
that kidnapped you

370
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,276
and dumped you in the desert?

371
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,551
- Amongst other things, yes.
- Okay, well,

372
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,989
I'm gonna need proof
that this guy is real.

373
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,276
Oh, he is real.

374
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,755
And very dangerous.

375
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,273
His organization has
been wreaking havoc

376
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,675
in the Midwest for years.

377
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,436
I ran into him in Chicago.
I couldn't get my hands on him.

378
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,075
See? It's the one thing
the lieutenant and I agree on:

379
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,396
our common enemy,

380
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,477
the Sinnerman.

381
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,830
So you two discussed this?

382
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,191
When were you gonna fill me in?

383
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,550
It's a need-to-know basis
only, Decker.

384
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,796
Feel free to blame me.

385
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,831
- Hmm.
- The thing is,

386
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,599
this does not seem
like the Sinnerman.

387
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,240
He kills for power and influence.

388
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,190
Taunting a nightclub
owner seems petty, small.

389
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,198
Well, perhaps you don't know
the full story.

390
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,394
Okay, we're gonna
treat this murder

391
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,954
as we would any other crime:

392
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,913
we follow the evidence
till we find the truth,

393
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,430
Sinnerman or not.

394
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,552
Sorry, but I don't
have time for that.

395
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,038
Lucifer,

396
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,316
where are you going?

397
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,951
Brother!

398
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,833
I'm about to tear
the criminal underworld apart

399
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,355
looking for
this Sinnerman fellow.

400
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,438
I'd appreciate your help.
Call me back.

401
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,033
Oh, also, it's Lucifer.

402
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,474
Good luck with that.

403
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,116
He's probably too busy
with Linda to answer.

404
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,274
Mazikeen, you're back!

405
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,593
I love the hair.

406
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,791
Can we talk?

407
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,117
We certainly can.
Good timing. I need your help.

408
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,039
Hang on. Do you even care
what I was about to say?

409
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,755
Of course I do. It's just that
my current problem is important.

410
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,917
Well, how do you know
my thing isn't important?

411
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,714
Okay. Fine. What is it?

412
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,990
Did...

413
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,993
Sorry, just...

414
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,632
Telemarketers. They've
been hounding me all day.

415
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,479
This won't take long. Hello?

416
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,752
Unbelievable.

417
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,709
Look, whatever it is
you're selling,

418
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,996
I'm not interested, so...

419
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,190
Really?

420
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,952
And I thought
you were looking for me.

421
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,878
<i>It's the Sinnerman.</i>

422
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,118
You got the Sinnerman's
DNA profile?

423
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,712
- How?
- Our second vic, Frieda...

424
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,435
total fighter.

425
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,359
She struggled with the killer
and scratched him.

426
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,195
So I checked out her fingernail
scrapings and found

427
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,477
blood and skin cells.

428
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,034
And came up
with the killer's DNA.

429
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,630
Which matches a hair that
I recovered from Joey's place.

430
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,433
So, boom,

431
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,199
we can place the killer
at both scenes.

432
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,956
But, that's not even
the cool part.

433
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,637
I did some more digging
and found a perfect match

434
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,194
with a blood spatter sample

435
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,993
from an old Sinnerman case

436
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,270
in Chicago.

437
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,877
Proving that Pierce's Sinnerman
really is operating in L.A.

438
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,680
Ella, you're a miracle worker.

439
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,354
Aw, no biggie.

440
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,593
My peeps in Detroit made
some calls to Chicago PD for me.

441
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,355
Meant hours of sifting
through case files, but,

442
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,957
you know, I just put on

443
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,879
my Beastie Boys
and powered through.

444
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,190
Decker, did you hear
what I said?

445
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,191
What?

446
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,676
Hmm? Sorry. No.

447
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,759
Aw, never mind.

448
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,478
Man, I can't believe nothing

449
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,552
ever sparked between you
and the lieutenant.

450
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,713
I could've sworn
you guys had chemistry.

451
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:03,957
No.

452
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,316
No chemistry.

453
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,876
- Well, win some, lose some, I guess.
- That's right.

454
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,839
That is right.
Okay, I'm gonna call Lucifer.

455
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,713
Awesome work. Hey, Lucifer,

456
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,395
you were right. Call me back.
Try not to gloat too much.

457
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,796
Oh, easy, Decker.
What's the rush?

458
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,956
Hey, Lieutenant.

459
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,311
Um, so Ella found
the Sinnerman's DNA

460
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,079
at both scenes,
and I think we can use that

461
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,316
to lean on Frankie Ferrante.

462
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,989
That's promising.

463
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,876
Where's Lucifer?
You need help?

464
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,957
I mean, I'm free.

465
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,750
Oh, um...

466
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,314
Oh, I'm-I'm good,
thanks. I'm, um...

467
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,631
I'm okay. I'm gonna...
I'm gonna take Charlotte.

468
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,753
I'm sensing some tension here.

469
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,917
Really?

470
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,196
I'm not.

471
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,793
I haven't forgotten about your
request for a personal day.

472
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,320
Things have been crazy here.
I just haven't had a chance

473
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,716
- to look at the schedule yet.
- Yeah. No. All good.

474
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,990
I haven't been thinking
about that.

475
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,156
I-I'm actually gonna
take Charlotte

476
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,635
'cause she's perfect for this.

477
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,077
Keep me posted.

478
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,556
Mm-hmm.

479
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,636
You needed me, Detective?

480
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,597
Sure do.

481
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,797
Let's go.

482
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,710
Oh, Sinnerman!

483
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,194
Where are you?

484
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,236
The slaughterhouse vibe
is a little try-hard,

485
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,635
don't you think?

486
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,672
You know,
it's quite the party foul

487
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,712
when the host
doesn't even show up!

488
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,354
In here.

489
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,873
Ah, so what is it,
hide-and-seek now?

490
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,192
Come on, let's talk.

491
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,069
That is, if you're
man enough to face me!

492
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,915
I do love a captive audience.

493
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,276
Oh.

494
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,719
Well played.

495
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,789
It's a pleasure
to finally meet you.

496
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,279
Likewise.

497
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,718
Always gratifying to find out
that one's nemesis

498
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,832
is altogether lacking
in style.

499
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,196
Never been much
of a dresser.

500
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,312
I express myself
through my work.

501
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,391
I take it you're referring
to Frieda and Joey.

502
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,713
Why harm them
when you wanted me?

503
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,711
Well, you can't have a trap
without bait,

504
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,110
can you, now?

505
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,271
I hate to toot my own horn,
but I got you good.

506
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,709
Yes, indeed you did.

507
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,673
Quite the mousetrap
you've laid out for me.

508
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,039
And, unfortunately for you,

509
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,276
I'm no mouse.

510
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,117
And, unfortunately for you,

511
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,916
that's a foot
of reinforced steel.

512
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,514
Takes a little extra

513
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,310
to hold the Devil.

514
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,836
Who are you?

515
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,520
How did you return my wings
and steal my face?

516
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,230
Hmm.

517
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,916
You're just chock-full

518
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,276
of questions, aren't you?

519
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,112
Questions I'll answer
in time,

520
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,913
'cause you should have
plenty of that.

521
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,592
This place has been abandoned
for at least ten years.

522
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,357
Maybe they'll knock it down
with you still in it.

523
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,994
I tell you what, why don't you
take your sunglasses off, hmm?

524
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,353
Then we can have
a proper conversation.

525
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,995
Want to do your little
<i>desire</i> shtick?

526
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,559
Let me save us both
some time.

527
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,398
I like redheads, strawberries,
and long walks on the beach.

528
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,430
I've got work to do,
now that you're all checked in.

529
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,076
I don't have time
for parlor tricks.

530
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,596
Right.

531
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,797
You hide behind your glasses,

532
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,157
but know this...

533
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,511
when I find out what someone
truly desires,

534
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,031
I find out their
greatest weakness.

535
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,358
And that's not a parlor trick,
Sinnerman.

536
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,471
It's power.

537
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,870
Hmm.

538
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,395
And I promise you

539
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,791
I will find out
what you really want,

540
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,320
and when I do,

541
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,437
I'm going to use it
to destroy you.

542
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,754
Yeah.

543
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,472
I'm right here, pal.

544
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,836
What do you got?

545
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,911
Too slow.

546
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,150
Why?!

547
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,511
Why are you doing this?

548
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,310
You'll see.

549
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,431
No!

550
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,549
<i>The reason I asked you</i>

551
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,280
<i>to come along is 'cause
you know Frankie.</i>

552
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,039
I really need you
to work that connection.

553
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,435
He won't know what hit him.

554
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,351
Wait. Can you
stick to the script

555
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,036
and say exactly what
I told you to say?

556
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,879
Well, of course.
I'm not an idiot.

557
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,711
Let's go.

558
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,998
Last time we talked,
you wished there was a way

559
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,469
that you could help
with Joey's death.

560
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,796
Well, there is.

561
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,989
Our prime suspect is

562
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,074
a criminal who calls himself
the Sinnerman.

563
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,671
Doesn't ring a bell.

564
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,437
Frankie,

565
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,274
you know that you
and your people

566
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,800
are not under
investigation here.

567
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,275
We just want a way
to find this guy.

568
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,839
The Sinnerman is known
to have entrepreneurial ties.

569
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,474
Did you ever
cross paths with him?

570
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,996
Well, Louie here crosses paths
with the Cinnabon once a week.

571
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,954
Can't get enough of 'em.
Am I right, Louie?

572
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,072
Yeah.

573
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,032
If you help us out, I promise
it'll be worth your while.

574
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,469
- Charlotte, we can't do that.
- Look,

575
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,990
Frankie, come on, handy
for an entrepreneur like you

576
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,793
to have friends
in the DA's office.

577
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,832
Sorry, ladies.

578
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,554
- Wish I could help.
- Cut the crap, Frankie.

579
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,240
- Give us something.
- Charlotte...

580
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,198
Thank you, Mr. Ferrante,
for your time.

581
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,277
Good evening, gentlemen.

582
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,550
Good night, ladies.

583
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,630
I'm sorry,
Detective Decker.

584
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,314
I know I went off
script a bit,

585
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,716
but I wanted to get
you what you needed.

586
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,797
And I didn't.

587
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,156
Charlotte,
are you kidding me?

588
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,510
You were perfect.

589
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,394
Frankie had to make sure that
we weren't coming after him,

590
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,757
and coming from you,
he believed it.

591
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,792
Mobsters like that...
they don't talk to the cops.

592
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,315
Then what was the point of that?

593
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,432
How does this get us any closer
to the Sinnerman?

594
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,279
Frankie obviously
cares about Joey.

595
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,596
He's gonna want to get revenge.

596
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,156
I think he's gonna find
the Sinnerman on his own.

597
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,155
And when he does...

598
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,631
you'll be waiting.

599
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,880
You expected me
to fail, didn't you?

600
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,709
Why didn't you just
trust me with the truth?

601
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,519
Charlotte, you know
the things you've done.

602
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,111
You know the reasons
I can't trust you.

603
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,677
Huh. I suppose... I do.

604
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,234
And, look, I want to believe

605
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,920
that this change of heart
is for real,

606
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,035
but you're gonna have to
earn that trust back, okay?

607
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,950
This is a good start, though.

608
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,830
I got to stay here
and watch Frankie,

609
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,396
but let me call you a car,
get you a ride home.

610
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,200
I'll find my own way home.

611
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,032
Good night.

612
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,192
Oh. Night.

613
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,231
Hey, Pierce.

614
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,193
You still working
that Ferrante angle?

615
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,834
Uh, yeah, I am.

616
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,719
It's turned into a stakeout.
But why?

617
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,434
'Cause I brought food.

618
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,955
Mind if I join you?

619
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,189
Come on.

620
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,115
Oh...

621
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,673
So this is
your diabolical plan?

622
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,439
Is it? Hmm?

623
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,360
To <i>bore</i> me to death?!

624
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,789
Lucifer?

625
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,711
Lucifer, I know
you're in here.

626
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,196
In here!

627
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,110
Maze!

628
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,711
Oh, you're a sight
for sore eyes.

629
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,314
I didn't realize
you still kept tabs on me.

630
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,195
What are you
talking about?

631
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,438
I tracked you down because I
have a bone to pick with you.

632
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,037
- What?
- I asked you to talk.

633
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,478
And you blow me off
and hide in a freezer?

634
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,634
I thought we were
past all of this.

635
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,036
Oh, sure, yeah, thought
I'd just hang around in here

636
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,920
like a frozen side of beef
just to avoid you.

637
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,555
Hello! I was a prisoner!

638
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,194
The Sinnerman had me
trapped here.

639
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,231
Uh...

640
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,156
Now would you please
just stand aside?

641
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,277
I need to figure out
what he's up to,

642
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,880
and I've already lost
enough time as it is.

643
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,560
Hang on. You were trapped?

644
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,435
Well, obviously!

645
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,117
Maze!

646
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,037
Oh, for...

647
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,599
Maze! Come on, open up!

648
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,355
I've got places to go,
people to hurt!

649
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,758
Just think of someone else's
needs for a change!

650
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,510
Can you hear me?

651
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,072
You're going nowhere, Lucifer.

652
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,276
You don't get out until you
listen to what I have to say,

653
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,796
<i>and</i> act like you care.

654
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,274
Can't believe this.

655
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,160
What's on your mind, Maze?

656
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,158
Did you know that Linda
and Amenadiel are a thing?

657
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,312
Linda and Amenadiel
are doing what now?

658
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,155
How'd you know?
What makes you say that?

659
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,396
Well, I saw them

660
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,000
in her office.

661
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,870
"Talking."

662
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,358
They were clearly about to bone.

663
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,517
Right, you do realize

664
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,195
that talking in her office
is literally Linda's job?

665
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,200
Interesting point.

666
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,669
Hmm, isn't it?

667
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,075
And, you know, so what

668
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,716
if Amenadiel is playing doctor
with the doctor?

669
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,240
So our old flames
are having a fling.

670
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,954
I don't care.
Why should you?

671
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,790
Unless...

672
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,036
Unless you're still hot
for angel?

673
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,390
- No!
- No?

674
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,477
- No!
- Ah.

675
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,876
Well, I...
I mean, she's just...

676
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,595
my best friend, and he's my ex.

677
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,237
I don't like it.

678
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,830
So, you don't want him,
but nobody else can have him.

679
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,360
That's awfully greedy
of you, Maze.

680
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,240
I've been gone
for too long, okay?

681
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,592
I just need to know
what the hell is going on.

682
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,190
And what <i>would</i> you do
<i>if</i> you knew?

683
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,111
Hmm?

684
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,754
Look, you really want
my advice, Mazikeen?

685
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,440
Ask yourself
what you truly desire.

686
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,633
And be honest.
Otherwise, there's no point.

687
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,917
Maze?

688
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,040
Mazikeen?

689
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,356
You still there?

690
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,871
Thanks, Lucifer.

691
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,753
Great talk.
Glad I could help. Got to go.

692
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,631
<i>I wonder when Frankie's</i>

693
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,320
gonna make his move.

694
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,679
Soon. Bet they're reaching
out to their sources,

695
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,075
probably calling the
Sinnerman right now.

696
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,071
All right.

697
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,556
Out with it, Decker.

698
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,070
I either have food
in my teeth,

699
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,232
or you have something
you want to say to me.

700
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,230
Why is this case
so important to you?

701
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,192
It's not.

702
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,754
It's a high-priority case,
and...

703
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,076
I need to display leadership

704
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,237
to the suits downtown.
That's all.

705
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,990
Really? Showing up out of
nowhere while I'm on a stakeout?

706
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:09,998
You said it yourself.

707
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,271
You and the Sinnerman
crossed paths in Chicago.

708
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,949
This is personal,
isn't it?

709
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,356
It is.

710
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,311
The Sinnerman killed my brother.

711
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,556
I'm sorry.

712
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,630
I thought I could run away
from the pain of it.

713
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,756
From him.

714
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,151
Now I know that I can't anymore,

715
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,195
so I need to find him and
make him pay for what he did.

716
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,280
Do you know why
I asked for that personal day?

717
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,076
The anniversary of

718
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,078
my father's death is coming up.

719
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,871
And, uh, he was killed on duty.

720
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,834
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

721
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,710
It was a long time ago.

722
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,716
But just a few months ago,

723
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,434
we finally found
the guy who did it.

724
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,794
And I had dreamed of
that moment for so long.

725
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,030
Also kind of dreaded it.

726
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,795
I mean, he caused my
family so much pain.

727
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,831
When I finally
found him, I...

728
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,680
I didn't know
what I'd do.

729
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,876
What <i>did</i> you do?

730
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,560
I did the right thing.

731
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,755
I arrested him.

732
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,676
But it wasn't easy.

733
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,996
I get it.

734
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,071
I know why you don't talk
about this stuff.

735
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,391
I don't, either,
not even to Lucifer.

736
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,038
It's just too painful.

737
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,199
Think about what
you really want.

738
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,873
Don't do anything
you're gonna regret.

739
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,871
I guess I have
to give you

740
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,355
that personal day now.

741
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,235
Heads up, we got someone.

742
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,160
He doesn't look
like a mobster.

743
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,433
Maybe one of their sources.
Let's hang tight.

744
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,630
Copy that.

745
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,238
Lucifer.

746
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,357
Detective.

747
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,199
Finally. Look,
I'm on a stakeout.

748
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,352
You were right.

749
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,960
The Sinnerman
is behind this.

750
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,196
You don't say.

751
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,675
I've just gotten
out of cold storage

752
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,075
after being grabbed
by him again.

753
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,239
- What? Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

754
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,194
Just dying to crush that
pathetic excuse for a man.

755
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,517
You saw him? What
does he look like?

756
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,074
Black fellow, early 40s,

757
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,509
though he dresses
like an old man.

758
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,240
Would you believe
he wore a sweater vest?

759
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,675
His greatest crime yet.

760
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,794
That's not a source;
that's him.

761
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,511
Let's go.

762
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,670
Wait, Detective.

763
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,680
Detective?

764
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,516
Bloody hell.

765
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,999
Drop the weapon.

766
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,710
I'm on him! Cut him off!

767
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,956
Chloe, wait!

768
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,159
We've got units outside!

769
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,558
If you give up now,
we can take you in safely.

770
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,230
But this is so much fun.

771
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,194
Oh. Where are you?

772
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,870
Where are you?

773
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,479
Do what you got to do.

774
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:08,997
Pierce, wait.

775
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,512
Hey.

776
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,557
Let me help you.

777
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,640
You already did.

778
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,877
You're under arrest.

779
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,919
Let's go.

780
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,191
Detective.

781
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,669
You're okay. What happened?

782
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,149
- We got him.
- What?

783
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,240
You did it.
You got the Sinnerman.

784
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,798
Actually, Pierce did.

785
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,797
Right.

786
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,235
Right. Well,
where-where is he?

787
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,996
He's, um...

788
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,640
I want to talk to him.

789
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,636
Lucifer.

790
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,157
Don't worry.

791
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,670
You'll get your chance.

792
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,310
Officer, he's ready.

793
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,480
Linda, you there?

794
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,232
What's up?

795
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,478
Are you alone?

796
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,914
Yeah. Why?

797
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,874
'Cause you're acting
kind of strange.

798
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,436
What's going on?

799
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,717
Uh...

800
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,033
I should have told
you this earlier,

801
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,236
but it was... weird

802
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,074
seeing you and Amenadiel so...
chummy.

803
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,632
Oh. Were we?

804
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,110
Yeah, you were.

805
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,117
Made me feel like beating
the crap out of him.

806
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,512
Or at least
throwing rocks at cars.

807
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,080
But, no, I didn't.

808
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,352
I came to tell you how I feel.

809
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,238
Yes.

810
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,756
Please. Tell me.

811
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,278
Okay. Um...

812
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,111
I've been thinking
about it all day.

813
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,116
You're my best friend, you know?

814
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,192
And he's my ex.

815
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,034
And by-by "ex," I mean, like,

816
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,954
one of a million
ex-sexual partners

817
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,113
and not anything special.

818
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,317
Any-Anyway, um...

819
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,277
it makes me feel left out.

820
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,955
So I don't want you two
getting together

821
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,669
if that's possible.

822
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,996
I understand.

823
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,399
You have nothing to worry about.

824
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:15,797
Thank you.

825
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,592
I figured you wouldn't
want my sloppy seconds, anyway.

826
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,193
And you know me,
I was all over that angel.

827
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,596
I went in deep.

828
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,670
Used every tool

829
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,553
in that Swiss Army knife.

830
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,677
Know what I mean?

831
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,192
I touched nerves that he never
knew he had.

832
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,791
I can only imagine.

833
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,111
Yeah.

834
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,390
Anyway...

835
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,675
You're the best, Linda.

836
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,636
You okay in there?

837
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,757
Um...

838
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,713
I'm-I'm fine.

839
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,277
Thank you, Detective Espinoza.

840
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,476
Charlotte?

841
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,478
I just needed
a moment.

842
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,319
And I thought that this was...

843
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,039
the one place that
I wouldn't be disturbed.

844
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,638
I don't want to pry, but, uh,

845
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,039
you don't seem fine.

846
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,591
I'm not.

847
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,714
I switched to prosecution

848
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,434
to try and be
a better person...

849
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,560
but I'm not
helping anyone.

850
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,118
I just keep screwing
things up.

851
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,990
I was really good
at being the old me.

852
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,190
The best.

853
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,716
But I know I need
to make a change.

854
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,072
And I suck at it.

855
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,509
No one expects you
to change overnight.

856
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,032
It's hard to be one
of the good guys.

857
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,993
Look, I screw up, too.

858
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,794
I've made plenty of mistakes,
believe me.

859
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,199
But I don't quit...

860
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,033
and I know that
counts for something.

861
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,354
At least you're trying, right?

862
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,117
Thank you, Dan.

863
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,430
Don't mention it.

864
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,080
Oh, hey, Hernandez.

865
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,235
I'm in the men's room,
aren't I?

866
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,237
Oh, yeah.

867
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,116
My, my...

868
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,234
how the tables have turned.

869
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,920
I don't know if you remember,
but I made you a promise:

870
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,036
to look into your eyes
and find out

871
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,550
what the great Sinnerman
desires...

872
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,714
and then take it from him.

873
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,956
I'm a man of my word,
so let's get to it, shall we?

874
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,557
Look at me.

875
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,671
Look into my eyes!

876
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,711
Now...

877
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,190
you'll never know what I want.

878
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,317
But...

879
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:02,872
Code twenty!

880
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:03,877
Twenty!

881
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,355
Code twenty!

882
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,159
Somebody get a
medic in here!
