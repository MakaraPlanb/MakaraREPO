1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,958
<i>Previously, on</i> Lucifer...

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,875
Doctor, someone is forcing
those wings on me.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,434
They took away my devil face.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,597
I won't stand for someone
making me something I'm not.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,597
But your wings,

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,154
- they grew back?
- They did.

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,232
Look, if you're upset
about what the lieutenant said,

8
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,671
you're not alone...
he's not a fan of mine, either.

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,111
And I still can't believe he
called me "Lucifer's partner."

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,754
<i>And even though
he doesn't realize it,</i>

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,152
everything he does
seems designed to hurt me.

12
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,350
To test you?

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,199
My test is Lucifer.

14
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,959
It's always been Lucifer.

15
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,879
I'm Lucifer
bloody Morningstar.

16
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,231
I do favors better
than anyone else.

17
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,840
Or at least I used to.

18
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,440
<i>And I think that maybe</i>

19
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,672
<i>it's about time
I got back in the game.</i>

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,517
So, tell me, what's
your deepest, darkest fantasy?

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,433
To have sex in the ball pit
at a Chuck E. Cheese.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,480
- Not what I was expecting.
- I mean,

23
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,559
the thought of getting caught,
it just turns me on.

24
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,917
All right, well, I'd rather
eat a plate of warm mayonnaise

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,595
than visit that child-laden
cesspool, but, um...

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,591
you are a
persuasive one,

27
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,519
- aren't you?
- Yay.

28
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,470
Ooh, let's practice.

29
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,477
Why not?

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,390
Lexy, darling?

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,671
- I'm home.
- Oh, no.

32
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,155
No, no, no, no, no.

33
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,760
He's not supposed to be
back until tomorrow.

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,355
Quick. Hide.

35
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,477
Lexy.

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,791
Relax.

37
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,035
I'll handle this.

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,237
What the hell?

39
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,551
Rest easy.
I'm not a thief.

40
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,480
Your valuables are untouched...
unless, of course,

41
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,591
you consider your wife
a valuable.

42
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,678
In that case,
I've touched her several times.

43
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,394
Twice this morning.

44
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,953
Who the hell do you
think you are?

45
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,355
Lucifer Morningstar, Your Honor.

46
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,473
My apologies. I had no idea
I was dealing with a man

47
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,235
of such stature.
In my defense,

48
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,237
when we came in last night,

49
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,035
I was blindfolded
by your wife's underwear, so...

50
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,199
You're messin'
with the wrong guy, pal.

51
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,636
Ah, violence... now we're
getting somewhere interesting.

52
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,433
Come on, let it
flow. Tell me,

53
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,996
is kicking my ass
what you truly desire?

54
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,517
No.

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,911
No, I just...

56
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,953
I... I want a friggin' nap.

57
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,353
Look, I know
I'm a cliché.

58
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,598
I married the yoga instructor.

59
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,996
But you wouldn't believe
the body on that girl.

60
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,429
Wouldn't I?

61
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,675
Right.

62
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,231
So you get it.

63
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,840
- Mm-hmm.
- In the beginning,

64
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,436
it was great... partying
all the time, there was...

65
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,511
Tons of sex.

66
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,989
You must have felt
like a new man.

67
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,032
But then... let me guess...
it became...

68
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,117
Exhausting.

69
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,517
All of that.

70
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,718
Sex, partying,

71
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,077
and... Coachella.

72
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,158
- Ooh.
- That's not who I am.

73
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,436
In all honesty,
I just...

74
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,400
I just want to chill
with my ex, Marsha.

75
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,319
<i>She</i> engaged my mind.

76
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,150
Well, truth be told,
I've been experiencing

77
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,511
an identity conundrum myself.

78
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,997
Well, that was until I realized
that the best way

79
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,795
to remind myself
of the Devil I am today

80
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,635
is to fully embrace
the Devil I used to be.

81
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,037
Are you saying
I should call my ex?

82
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,515
Absolutely.

83
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,353
<i>And</i> I can help you.

84
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,198
How?

85
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,312
By graciously keeping
your new bride

86
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,194
sexually satisfied while you
reconnect with your old wife.

87
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,951
Yeah?

88
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,397
Deal?

89
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,270
Uh, deal.

90
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,920
But don't forget...

91
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,470
now I've done you a favor,
you owe <i>me</i> one.

92
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,875
Of course.

93
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,430
Wh-Whatever you want.

94
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,437
Lovely.

95
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,271
Right.

96
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,158
Mm.

97
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,110
I, uh, better get on with
my end of the bargain.

98
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,314
Lexy, darling,

99
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,398
the Devil's back.

100
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,073
Hey, Lieutenant.
You busy?

101
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,192
Depends what you're
gonna ask me next.

102
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,391
Well, uh, in an effort
to strengthen

103
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,354
my own professional identity
within the department,

104
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,076
I'd like to take on
some added responsibility.

105
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,512
I'd like to be put up
for the open union rep position.

106
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,750
Request denied.

107
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,676
Can I ask why?

108
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,671
See, one of the few benefits

109
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,758
of having the "L" and the "T"
in front of my name

110
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,679
is I don't have
to explain myself.

111
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,717
Anything else?

112
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,117
No.

113
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,830
Detective.

114
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,236
New body just dropped.

115
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,318
Since you're here,

116
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,749
you might as well take it.

117
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,911
Whoa.

118
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,634
What was that about?

119
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,396
- You could tell just by watching?
- Oh, my God, yeah.

120
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,080
He is so into you.

121
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,074
- You're joking.
- Uh, no.

122
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,755
Scorching fire. Five-alarm.

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,673
But all I'm gonna say.

124
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,234
I, uh, heard we
caught a body.

125
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,556
I'll grab my kit.

126
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,673
Lucifer. Where have you been?

127
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,360
Saving a marriage.

128
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,920
Listen, I've been waiting
here to tell you that

129
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,396
I finally figured out
what my task is from Father

130
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,512
- to get my powers back.
- Ah? Well,

131
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,955
this should be
the opposite of interesting.

132
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,116
It's you, Brother.

133
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,312
You...

134
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,630
are my task.

135
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,509
Slightly more interesting.

136
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,240
How am I your task?

137
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,834
I have no idea.

138
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,994
I mean, am I supposed
to help you, teach you?

139
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,669
You see, I was sent down here
to be with you for a reason.

140
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,515
Now, maybe... maybe that means
I'm supposed to learn from <i>you.</i>

141
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,555
Well, if you really <i>need</i> to understand me, Brother,

142
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,160
then you must first...

143
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,236
walk a mile
in my Italian loafers.

144
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,551
Walk a mile in your shoes?

145
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,716
Mm-hmm.

146
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,232
All right.

147
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,633
Well, tell me how to...

148
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,800
- "Lucifer."
- Oh, baby steps.

149
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,912
It took eons to perfect this.

150
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,280
All right, first off,
a... a makeover.

151
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,271
Clothes.

152
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,199
Shoes.

153
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,353
try smiling.

154
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,037
Right.

155
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,912
We can work on that.

156
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,198
Through there, my closet,
I grant you...

157
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,033
entrée to all things me.

158
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,316
And give me your phone.

159
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,231
Okay.

160
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,311
Right.

161
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,356
Now you have access
to all my social media accounts:

162
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,233
Instagram, Snapchat, Grindr.

163
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,078
Go.

164
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,316
Release your inner Devil.

165
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,910
But what should
I do first?

166
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,600
Oh, I don't know.

167
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,632
Get laid. Play the piano.

168
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,109
Punish evil.

169
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,752
Just, whenever you're faced
with a choice,

170
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,953
ask yourself
the question: WWLD?

171
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,676
What Would Lucifer Do?

172
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,276
Hey. Got an ID?

173
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,312
Yep. Meet Emily Goddard.

174
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,314
23.

175
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,590
Counselor here.

176
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,433
Body was found in the trough.

177
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,349
"Firehawk Ranch
Transformational Center."

178
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,478
Yeah, it's a high-end
reform program

179
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,234
for juvenile
drug offenders and addicts.

180
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,157
Oh.

181
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,356
Really?

182
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,670
So, what, she drown?

183
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,678
No.

184
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,031
Stabbed.

185
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,709
In her office, upstairs.

186
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,717
Then took a tumble

187
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,115
out the window,
and...

188
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,197
splashdown.

189
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,712
We have a murder weapon?

190
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,434
Nothing yet.

191
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,200
But... from the depth
of the wound,

192
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,353
blunting on one side...

193
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,473
I'd say we're looking
for either a knife

194
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,160
or a tool with a...

195
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,392
four-to five-inch
serrated blade.

196
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,240
So this, uh, so-called
"reform program,"

197
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,590
it claims to transform
bad kids into good ones?

198
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,240
Only reform program
I ever knew was

199
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,590
my <i>abuelita's</i> boot.

200
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,836
It was pretty effective.

201
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,110
I'm sure.

202
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,955
Oh, there's
the guy in charge.

203
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,432
Hi.

204
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,399
Detective Chloe Decker.
And he is...

205
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,517
Very skeptical.

206
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,196
Jerry Blackcrow...
founder of Firehawk Ranch.

207
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,279
- This is terrible.
- Do you know anyone

208
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,954
who may have wanted
to hurt Ms. Goddard?

209
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,436
No. She was one
of my best counselors.

210
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,040
Everyone adored her.

211
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,515
Any idea what
happened, then?

212
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,592
Someone must have snuck
onto the property and done this.

213
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,360
Well, we're surrounded
by ne'er-do-wells,

214
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,358
and he thinks the culprit
came from the outside.

215
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,437
Delusional.

216
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,155
Killer's
obviously here.

217
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,311
Probably him.

218
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,989
Shifty eyes.
Or... no, sorry... her.

219
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,350
The ginger...
she's got

220
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,631
that "I like to watch the life
drain out of people" look.

221
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,951
- Okay.
- Like I'm the only one who sees it!

222
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,032
No way one of my kids did this.

223
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,079
They all walk the Firehawk Path.

224
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,794
This is a place
of transformation.

225
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,957
Uh, no.
This is a scam.

226
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,476
People can't
be changed.

227
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,000
Trust me, I know.

228
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,237
Perhaps they just need
the right kind of motivation.

229
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,360
As a former addict
and ex-con,

230
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,233
I'm living proof
that people can change.

231
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,478
Our kids graduate
to better lives.

232
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,636
Sorry to get all interrupty,
but they just found

233
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,194
this tool belt
in the victim's office.

234
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,796
Looks like
an item's missing.

235
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,630
Pruning saw's gone.

236
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,150
Let me guess... four to five
inches, serrated blade?

237
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,677
It's our missing murder weapon.
Whose tool belt is that?

238
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,836
One of the residents.

239
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,749
Only they receive them.

240
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,520
Oh, well, game,
set, match <i>moi.</i>

241
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,035
It appears one of your pupils

242
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,471
has just graduated
to murder one.

243
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,358
- "Nine five four four."
- We keep strict records

244
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,279
of all the equipment
issued to the kids.

245
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,797
Taking care
of your gear

246
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,956
is the sixth stepping stone

247
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,350
on the Firehawk Path to healing.

248
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,552
Ah, is stepping stone seven,
"Use said gear

249
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,240
to kill someone
you hate"?

250
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,750
Uh, excuse me.

251
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,040
What is that?
The badge.

252
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,316
Uh, those are
Colin's Firehawk wings.

253
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,237
Highest honor here.

254
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,557
Wings as an honor?

255
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,592
Is this a joke?

256
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,957
No. It's part of
the reward system.

257
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,391
The better the residents behave,
the more benefits they earn.

258
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,515
Wings are only given to those
who have truly reformed.

259
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,831
They get the most sought-after
privileges, like...

260
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,717
- computer time, phone calls...
- So, h-hold on.

261
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,560
You curtail the free will
of these rebellious souls

262
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,796
by making them follow
your rules,

263
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,320
and then you trick them
into thinking

264
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,954
they've changed by
giving them wings?

265
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,551
A most vile manipulation.

266
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,479
And completely unoriginal,
I might add.

267
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,120
- Lucifer...
- Tyson Chase.

268
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,836
The tool belt... it was
assigned to Tyson Chase.

269
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,234
Where can we find Tyson?

270
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,913
Well, it appears Tyson used
his wings to fly the coop.

271
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,600
Still think people can change?

272
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,878
Tell me, what is
it you desire?

273
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,554
For you to move
so I can talk to my boyfriend.

274
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,115
Oh. S-S...

275
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,676
Sorry about that.

276
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,109
Hello, there.

277
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,117
- Guess what?
- What?

278
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,954
You get to have sex with me.

279
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,953
You want to
buy me a drink?

280
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,678
<i>Tyson's father</i>

281
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,111
in jail, mother's dead.
Foster care.

282
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,914
In and out of juvie
since he was seven.

283
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,389
Record is sealed.

284
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,632
Judging by the size
of his file,

285
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,957
Firehawk Ranch was probably
Tyson Chase's last stop

286
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,431
before a long stay
at Chino or San Quentin.

287
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,353
Hmm.
You get something from MTA?

288
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,996
Yup. Camera caught him exiting
a station in Hollywood.

289
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,111
No sign of him after that.

290
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,240
Hey, Decker, how's it going
with the Firehawk case?

291
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,031
Very well, sir.

292
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,118
Uh, murder weapon
still missing.

293
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,959
Although, we've
identified the suspect.

294
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,992
Tyson Chase.
He's a resident.

295
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,396
There's a BOLO out.

296
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,435
So no one's in custody yet?

297
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,552
Not yet.

298
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,590
Thought you'd be further along.

299
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,476
Wow.

300
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,714
Why is Pierce
such a dick to me?

301
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,115
Who cares?
He's a dick to everybody.

302
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,720
No, but I seem
to be getting

303
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,513
extra helpings of
his dickishness.

304
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,313
I know he's
considered a rock star

305
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,671
downtown with the suits, but
if he's got a problem with me,

306
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,236
I want to find out,
I want to fix it,

307
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,278
and I don't want it
messing with my career.

308
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,874
Maybe you're not
the problem.

309
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,477
Lucifer!

310
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,118
Mm.

311
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,075
Well, looks like someone could
use a single malt cappuccino.

312
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,677
Single malt latte?

313
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,870
I'd prefer

314
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,514
if you helped us find
Tyson Chase.

315
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,552
Your focus has been
all over the map on this case.

316
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,594
Well, I forget how much you've
come to rely on me these days.

317
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,315
Allow me to consult.
Catching this little

318
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,715
degenerate is quite simple.

319
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,594
Whatever Tyson's sin was
in the past, he's back at it.

320
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,472
And you know why?

321
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,520
People don't change.

322
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,871
We don't know his crimes.
His record is sealed.

323
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,837
Tyson's a minor.

324
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,912
Well, I'll call a judge,
get it unsealed.

325
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,117
It may take a few days.

326
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,040
Or not. I may have a way
to cut a few corners.

327
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,357
Getting caught cutting corners
is the last thing

328
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,630
I need right now, Lucifer.

329
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,478
It'll be better
if I handle it alone.

330
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,431
Go fish.

331
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,672
Ah. Hello, Judgey.

332
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,589
And this must be Marsha.

333
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,677
Uh, Lucifer.

334
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,798
- What do you want?
- That favor returned.

335
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,110
I need your help proving

336
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,437
a young deplorable
hasn't reformed and never will.

337
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,833
So... your turn to pick

338
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,275
from the pile,
I think.

339
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,157
Bravo.

340
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,199
Quick. I mean, not
Vin Diesel quick,

341
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,073
but impressive nonetheless.
Scoot over.

342
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,278
Well. Tyson Chase.

343
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,278
Your record said you
liked to steal cars

344
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,357
to pay for your drugs.

345
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,119
Vintage muscle cars,
to be precise.

346
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,834
And you've been
arrested here twice.

347
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,760
I guess third time's a charm,
and by charm, I mean me.

348
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,157
Yeah, but my record's sealed.
How'd you know?

349
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,595
I called in a favor.

350
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,190
'Cause I need to prove to that
charlatan at Firehawk Ranch

351
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,836
that you are and always
will be a criminal.

352
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,757
Whatever, man.

353
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,237
Look, if you a cop,
I got nothing to say.

354
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,319
Nothing matters
anymore anyway.

355
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,196
I'd rather die than go back.

356
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,837
Well, that can
be arranged.

357
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,589
Oh!

358
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,994
Chill out. Chill out.
Chill out! Slow down.

359
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,998
- Slow down.
- I'm not gonna slow down, Tyson.

360
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,873
You said you wanted to die.
Do you want a quick death,

361
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,232
- or a slow death?
- No! I take it back. Stop. Stop.

362
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,070
- Hey, man, what...
- what you doing?

363
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,520
Okay, look, I take it back,
all right? I take it back.

364
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,076
I don't want to die. I'll come
with you, tell you anything.

365
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,831
Smells like you
might need a change

366
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,713
of underpants
first, Tyson.

367
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,595
I present to you
one unreformable gnat

368
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,156
- to answer for his crimes.
- Where did you find him?

369
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,352
I witnessed the little reprobate
stealing a getaway car,

370
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,199
so I carried out
a citizen's arrest.

371
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,514
Like I said,
once bad, always bad.

372
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,200
Look, get this psycho dude
away from me!

373
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,231
He almost killed me!

374
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,079
Hello, kettle.

375
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,270
Pot calling.

376
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,556
However, I must commend you on
your choice of murder weapon.

377
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,473
- Murder weapon?
- We found your tool belt

378
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,517
in Emily Goddard's office,

379
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,116
minus the pruning saw
that you used to kill her.

380
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,073
Wait. Emily's dead?

381
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,876
Oh, my God.

382
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,960
- You think I killed her?
- Yes.

383
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,198
No. Look, I loved Emily.

384
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,517
I'd never hurt her.

385
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,120
People heard you fighting,
Tyson.

386
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,840
Because she wouldn't talk to me.

387
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,430
I just wanted to talk.

388
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,596
About what?

389
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,954
Look, I turned 18,

390
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,998
and didn't have to stay
at the ranch anymore.

391
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,073
I wanted her to come with me.

392
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,993
Look, we kissed one time...

393
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,432
but she said it was... she...

394
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,600
she said it was a mistake.

395
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,836
She wouldn't leave.

396
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,595
Oh, no.

397
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,154
She rejected you?

398
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,033
So you killed her!

399
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,760
This is all my fault.

400
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,474
Oh, finally, we're
getting somewhere.

401
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,675
No. Look, if-if I hadn't left,
Emily would still be alive.

402
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,236
- I could've protected her.
- From who?

403
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,314
Uh, she was worried about

404
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,715
expelling a resident.

405
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,195
Said everything had gone
to hell.

406
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,198
That's why
she wouldn't talk with me.

407
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,800
That's why we fought.

408
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,837
Look, please,
you have to believe me.

409
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,475
- Filthy liar.
- I believe him.

410
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,155
My gut tells me
it's not him.

411
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,794
And I want to
explore this mystery

412
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,673
resident that Emily
wanted to expel.

413
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,030
How much walking
and talking

414
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,596
like a murderous,
sociopathic duck is necessary

415
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,156
for us to realize the killer is sitting in our laps?

416
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,791
Something you'd like
to add here, Espinoza?

417
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,872
Uh, no. Sorry.
I just...

418
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,878
I need to go help a
friend who's in trouble.

419
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,993
Well, don't let your day job
keep you.

420
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,597
I'll have
the victim's files sent over.

421
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,713
Maybe we can get a lead
on whoever she wanted to expel.

422
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,836
I doubt I could
be less impressed

423
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,514
by the lack of
consensus here.

424
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,431
All we have now is no murder
weapon and a possible motive?

425
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,233
We got to cut him loose.

426
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,556
Without a murder weapon,

427
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,320
we don't have enough evidence
to keep him.

428
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,352
Hello, Tyson.
Just me again.

429
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,711
Now, why can't you
embrace your true self, hmm?

430
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,831
You're a bad seed.

431
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,793
Just celebrate the
darkness inside.

432
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,832
No, please!
Just leave me alone!

433
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,072
- I won't leave you alone until you tell me the truth.
- Look, please don't hurt me.

434
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,396
I promise I've changed.

435
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,920
Lucifer, let him go!

436
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,318
I take full responsibility
for his actions.

437
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,398
- This won't happen again.
- Why not?

438
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,913
Kid turns out not
to be the murderer,

439
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,276
your friend just
scared him straight.

440
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,957
Well done, Lucifer.

441
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,714
Way to be a good influence.

442
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,833
How dare you say that?

443
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,074
Do you see what
you've done now?

444
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,197
I'll show them
a good influence.

445
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,000
Good morning.
Good morning.

446
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,277
Right, gather 'round, children.
Gather 'round.

447
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,717
Come on.

448
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,991
Don't be shy.

449
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,270
Don't be shy.
I don't bite.

450
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,037
Ah.

451
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,312
- Who's the suit?
- Lucifer Morningstar,

452
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,752
your substitute counselor
and resident bad influence.

453
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,679
Is this some kind
of reverse psychology?

454
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,800
I assure you,

455
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,872
my budding miscreant,
nothing of the sort.

456
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,198
No, the lesson
I'm about to teach you

457
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,831
is pure deviance.
Yes, come on.

458
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,870
Room for everyone. Come on,
you at the back. Right.

459
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,437
Okay, before I start,
I'd humbly like to ask you guys

460
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,593
a little about
yourselves, so, tell me,

461
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,600
what is it you all desire?

462
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,314
- Get rich.
- Instagram model.

463
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,550
- Make people feel good.
- Oh.

464
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,989
- I just want to be alone, man.
- Be my own boss.

465
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,077
Play video games!

466
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,276
My father's love.

467
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,516
- Oh.
- Easy money!

468
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,790
I just want to get high, man.

469
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,310
I hear you. I hear you. Right.

470
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,916
So what I'm getting

471
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,630
is that you all want to get back
to your true selves.

472
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,398
I mean, yes, micro-nutrients

473
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,353
in the soil <i>are</i> important,

474
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,596
but the key here, people,

475
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,793
the key here is
vertical integration.

476
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,799
And it all starts
with solid distribution.

477
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,278
Right. Now, I'm partial
to the Paraguay corridor,

478
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,197
mainly because...

479
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,277
Oh, oh, uh?

480
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,755
Pl... Yes. Hair boy.

481
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,520
Uh, but what about
hands-on experience?

482
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,792
Oh, right.

483
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,912
Well, I do happen
to know some wonderful CEOs

484
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,759
down in Sinaloa, Mexico.

485
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,077
Perhaps I could arrange
some internships.

486
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,640
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, well.

487
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,958
The road to hell really is paved
with bad acne-prone intentions.

488
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,157
So much potential here! But...

489
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,558
Sorry. Am I boring you, darling?

490
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,673
Yeah. Screw Paraguay
and micro-nutrients.

491
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,590
The only things you need
to be your own CEO

492
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,996
is irrigation and
a south-facing slope.

493
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,631
Ah.

494
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,914
Here's your drug empire, Teach.

495
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,835
Well, then.

496
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,434
It appears someone's gunning
for extra credit.

497
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,155
Don't get high on your own supply.

498
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,716
Don't get high on your own supply.

499
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,832
Snitches end up in ditches.

500
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,271
Snitches end up in ditches.

501
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,318
Hugs, not drugs.

502
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,950
No... Sorry,
sorry. Reverse that one.

503
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,799
Drugs, not hugs.

504
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,354
Drugs, not hugs.

505
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,471
Lucifer?

506
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,317
Detective.

507
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,959
What is going on here?

508
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,197
And how did you
get that horse?

509
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,517
What horse?

510
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,557
Ugh.

511
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,755
Bye!

512
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,359
Ah, they should award him
his wings.

513
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,199
Then he'd look like
Pegasus.

514
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,958
What are you
so upset about?

515
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,674
I mean, it was
a valuable teaching moment

516
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,870
for the children.

517
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,233
They are our future, after all.

518
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,113
You're teaching them
to grow drugs.

519
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,312
No, no, no, I'm teaching them
to <i>sell</i> drugs.

520
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,517
Regardless,
what brings you here?

521
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,870
Our job.

522
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,194
Which is to find the kid
that Emily was about to expel.

523
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,880
In her files, it said

524
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,673
that she had recently busted
one of the residents

525
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,076
for apparently running
a drug operation.

526
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,272
No.

527
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,232
Oh.

528
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,709
Right.
So... Well, it appears

529
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,070
I've been doing our job, too.

530
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,634
Carly, front and center.

531
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,150
My prized pupil.

532
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,511
She had her own weed operation
already up and running.

533
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,349
Oh. So, this is all yours?

534
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,000
Not saying a word
without my lawyer.

535
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,277
Sorry, I taught her that.

536
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,790
But I have to say, Detective,

537
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,117
this young lady
really is going places.

538
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,517
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
All the way to jail.

539
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,396
Yo, buddy.

540
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,110
What the hell happened, man?

541
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,635
Detective Espinoza.

542
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,070
It's good to see you.

543
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,232
When I heard the charges,
I mean...

544
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,557
Listen, we had just performed
the act of love,

545
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,752
and then she demanded money.

546
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,549
At first,
I assumed it was for bus fare,

547
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,558
but then she wanted
quite a large amount.

548
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,359
And then her cousin showed up,

549
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,991
who shared very little familial
resemblance, by the way,

550
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,554
and then he also
demanded money.

551
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,315
Right, right.
So when he wouldn't take no

552
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,273
for an answer, you got into
a fight, and you beat him up.

553
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,118
Uh-huh.

554
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,549
You do realize
she's a call girl, right?

555
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,792
I know what a prostitute is!

556
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,792
I just didn't know she was one.

557
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,032
And then, her cousin... well,
he wouldn't listen to reason.

558
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,755
You mean... her pimp?

559
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,871
Yes, of course.

560
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,472
Look, I don't need any of
the details, all right?

561
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,034
The important thing is,
the watch commander's

562
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,954
my old training officer,
so I pulled some strings.

563
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,190
You're cut loose.
Don't worry.

564
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,631
Don't worry.
I didn't say a word to Lucifer.

565
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,879
How we doing
on the investigation?

566
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,673
Well, this investigation has...

567
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,400
...smoked out

568
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,910
Carly Glantz.
Rap sheet a mile long.

569
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,993
Made no progress at reform.

570
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,960
Working theory is
that she found out

571
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,674
Emily was about
to expel her.

572
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,310
So she killed her to protect
herself and her drug operation.

573
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,517
And then, Carly lawyered up
before we could get to her.

574
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,996
- Still no murder weapon?
- And no evidence tying her to the scene.

575
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,270
Lucifer, any thoughts?

576
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:09,997
Lucifer is not

577
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,350
in the state of mind

578
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,438
to offer any constructive advice
right now.

579
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,875
Reach for the unexpected

580
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,318
and allow yourself
to be surprised.

581
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,034
Like crisps
and chocolate.

582
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,515
The results
can be quite pleasing. Mm.

583
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,280
That's good advice.
Decker, throw out the manual.

584
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,357
Think outside the box.

585
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,789
- Yes, Lieutenant.
- What?

586
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,520
I'm sorry. What are you
asking me to do?

587
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,200
Because Carly isn't gonna talk.

588
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,030
I want to talk.

589
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:40,400
Ah. Allow yourself to
be surprised indeed.

590
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,315
So,
you want to make a statement?

591
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,874
Yeah. So...

592
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,554
I guess I've been enlightened
by the Firehawk Path.

593
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,672
And I know
I can't find my happiness

594
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,274
if I don't
present my truth.

595
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,517
The night of the murder,
I saw Tyson Chase

596
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,871
digging by the sundial,
burying something.

597
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,833
- Burying what?
- Don't know.

598
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,271
It was dark, and I was
looking through a window.

599
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,231
Geez, do I have
to do all your work for you?

600
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,999
Carly, tone.

601
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,271
Should I roll over
and fetch, too, Dad?

602
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,398
Parents. Am I right?

603
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,072
So, how do I know
<i>you</i> didn't kill Emily?

604
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,396
Because Carly has

605
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,512
an iron-clad alibi.

606
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,877
During the murder,
she was in the shared room...

607
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,869
on the computer,

608
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,278
video chatting
with her boyfriend.

609
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,710
Now, instead of harassing
my daughter any further,

610
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,435
I suggest you go see
what's under that sundial.

611
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,240
I don't mean to backseat

612
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,477
dig, but aren't you
a bit far from the sundial?

613
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,318
I've got it. Thanks.

614
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,280
At least, I hope I do.

615
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,394
Hey, Ella, you're kind of, sort
of friendly with the lieutenant.

616
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,837
What's his deal?

617
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,880
Regarding what?

618
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,073
Well, no matter what I do,
it seems Pierce wants

619
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,953
to be a complete jerk to me.

620
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,280
Oh, this isn't about
that crazy vibe between you two?

621
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,075
No, this is about professional
respect, which I've earned.

622
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,749
I have the best close
rate in the department,

623
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,519
and it seems like,
no matter where I turn,

624
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,871
Pierce is there,
questioning my judgment.

625
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,639
Are you talking
about the new lieutenant?

626
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,354
I like him.
Very good judgment.

627
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,040
Totally agree. Spot on.

628
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,434
What? It's true.

629
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,279
Okay, you got it all wrong.

630
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,478
Look,

631
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,149
at first, I didn't think Pierce
liked me, either, but then,

632
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,272
a couple of days ago
in the kitchen,

633
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,075
he hands me the creamer

634
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,312
<i>and</i> the sugar.

635
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,795
And I didn't even ask for it.

636
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,274
I know, right?

637
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,831
Right.

638
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,636
See, Pierce had noticed
how I liked my coffee.

639
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:49,034
Just pay attention
to his actions, not his words.

640
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:54,353
And regardless, Decker,
you are a total badass.

641
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,710
Thank you, Ella.

642
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,550
You got something?

643
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,919
"Nine five four four."

644
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,993
It's Tyson Chase's number.

645
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,680
I guess he is our killer.

646
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,152
See? What did I tell you?
Once a bad guy,

647
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,880
always a bad guy.

648
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,318
The blood on Tyson Chase's
pruning saw matches the victim.

649
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,717
Carly Glantz puts
the bloody saw

650
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,116
in his hands
after the murder.

651
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,675
So Tyson Chase equals
homicidal maniac.

652
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,596
- What am I missing?
- Nothing.

653
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,436
Oh, sorry. It's just exhausting
being right all the time,

654
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,960
isn't it?
I'm kidding.

655
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:49,872
It's amazing.

656
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,998
Wait a minute.
What if Lucifer really is right?

657
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,197
Oh, go on.

658
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,040
Then if, per Lucifer,
people really don't reform,

659
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,594
that would also apply
to Carly Glantz.

660
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,354
Once bad, always bad, right?

661
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,153
Right. Finally you get it.

662
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,556
So, then, how the hell did
the worst kid in the program,

663
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,916
on the verge
of expulsion,

664
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,430
earn highly-coveted
computer privileges

665
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,875
to video chat
with her boyfriend?

666
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,311
I don't know.
Sexual favors?

667
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,472
Well, I want to go back
and talk to Jerry Blackcrow,

668
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,876
ask him some more questions.
Something doesn't add up.

669
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,070
You think Blackcrow's involved?

670
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,596
I don't know. Maybe.

671
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,951
I want to know why
Carly is getting these privileges.

672
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:21,991
Lucifer, you coming?

673
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,556
Oh, I can't. Sorry.
Duty calls.

674
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,194
Oh. What's duty's name?

675
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,313
Lexy, if you must know,
a judge's soon to be ex-wife.

676
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,590
It's a long story.

677
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,160
Great. Are you really
not coming?

678
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,033
I made a promise, Detective.

679
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,471
And who am I if I'm not
a devil of my word? Besides,

680
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,592
we both know
this case is already solved.

681
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,631
Lucifer, go.

682
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,635
You've earned
some private time.

683
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,310
Ah, well, thank you,
Lieutenant. See?

684
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,510
Great judgment.

685
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,431
I don't care what you say.
I'm gonna keep digging on this.

686
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,433
I think it's time
I ride along with you.

687
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,794
Frankly, Lieutenant, just
because you and I disagree

688
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,719
does not mean
I need a baby-sitter.

689
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,036
You coming, Decker?

690
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,791
My father is trying to teach me
a lesson about Lucifer.

691
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,796
Problem is, I don't know
what it is.

692
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,030
And he didn't tell you?

693
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,074
He's a bit, uh...

694
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,633
- enigmatic, my dad.
- Ah.

695
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,316
Sounds complicated.

696
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,920
You have no idea.

697
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,314
So I've been, um, walking
a mile in Lucifer's shoes

698
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,871
to learn more about him,
to try and understand him.

699
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,197
Bro, what's there to understand?
The guy does what he wants,

700
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,159
he says what he wants,
he gets away with it.

701
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,392
He parties constantly,
he apparently

702
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,514
has an endless supply of cash,
drives a sick-ass ride. Thanks.

703
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,910
And he gets to have sex with a
different hot girl every night.

704
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,119
What a terrible,
lonely existence.

705
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,960
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sounds awful.

706
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,598
Anyway, Dan,
thanks for bailing me out.

707
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,796
No problem, man.

708
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,237
We all need someone to have
our backs every now and then.

709
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,035
You're right. We do.

710
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,753
You sure this is
the right way?

711
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,430
Positive.

712
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,634
I'm a badass, you know.

713
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,796
Excuse me?

714
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,680
Even though
you don't trust me.

715
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,075
What makes you think
I don't trust you?

716
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,231
Oh, let's see.

717
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,280
You've only been breathing down
my neck this entire case.

718
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,598
Any time Lucifer sneezes,
you praise him, you berate me.

719
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,678
You chose to ride along just
so you could check up on me.

720
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,389
Oh, and you shot down
my request to be union rep

721
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,590
without even considering it.

722
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,797
What?
You think this is all a joke?

723
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,912
I'm laughing because you
think me turning you down

724
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,520
for that union rep
job was a bad thing.

725
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,080
How is it a good thing?

726
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,234
That job is for has-beens.

727
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,360
I'm not gonna waste one
of my best detectives

728
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,319
while you attend
useless meetings.

729
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,354
And the only reason I came here
was so I could finally

730
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,000
see you in action firsthand.

731
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,480
You think that I'm one
of your best detectives?

732
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,477
Decker, gun!

733
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,992
Lieutenant, come on.

734
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,190
Stay with me.

735
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,672
Unit 831. Officer down!

736
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,077
Officer down!

737
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,120
Get their statement and
get back to me, please.

738
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,720
- Detective?
- Thank you.

739
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,598
Are you okay?

740
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,234
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

741
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,079
I mean, thanks to
Lieutenant Pierce.

742
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,117
He saved my life.

743
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,959
Jerry Blackcrow tried
to kill you.

744
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,116
I don't believe it.

745
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,516
Wait. What am I saying?

746
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,872
Didn't he say
he was an ex-con himself?

747
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,794
More proof there's no such thing
as transformation.

748
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,990
Hey, can we talk
about this later?

749
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:24,951
I got to get to the hospital.

750
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,077
I...

751
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,639
Have 'em notify
Union Station, too.

752
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,077
Daniel?

753
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,117
Yeah.

754
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,635
Have you located
the reform guru?

755
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,593
- I'd like to have a word.
- Yeah? Well, get in line, pal.

756
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,956
We put out a statewide APB,

757
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,520
we're checking bus stations,
airports.

758
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,676
So far, nothing.

759
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,952
Look, man, Chloe's fine.

760
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,037
Luckily, Pierce
was with her.

761
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,869
But I wasn't.

762
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,680
Hey, guys, I want you to
check all local ATM cameras.

763
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,395
If Blackcrow is fleeing,
he's gonna need cash.

764
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,240
That's the only way to
get any at this hour.

765
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,152
Unless he's got a stash
somewhere.

766
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,189
So, this is where the
Firehawk Path leads.

767
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,631
A soggy stash of
coke-dusted twenties

768
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,394
and a boat
ride to Mexico.

769
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,996
How did you find me?

770
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,154
My prized pupil mentioned
using her dad's beach condo

771
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,476
as a stash house.

772
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,514
Of course her partner
would know that.

773
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,639
What do you want,
Mr. Morningstar?

774
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,830
To see the look on your face
when you finally admit

775
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,759
it was all a scam,

776
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,558
a ploy to bilk desperate
parents into falsely believing

777
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,229
that you could fix their
malevolent offspring.

778
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,319
I did a lot of good
for those kids.

779
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,359
So I was right
about people not changing,

780
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,159
just wrong about who.

781
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,671
I warned Emily,

782
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,718
but she wouldn't
listen to reason.

783
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,070
It was her own fault.

784
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,350
What about
the detective?

785
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,754
She was just in my way, man.

786
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,636
I'm not going back to jail!

787
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,910
Your punishment will be
far worse than jail.

788
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,159
Lucifer, stop!

789
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,191
You're gonna kill him.

790
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,432
So what?

791
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,791
Once evil,
always evil, right?!

792
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,271
No, Luci. You're not evil.

793
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,078
You're the Devil.

794
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,430
You <i>punish</i> evil.

795
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,395
Your words.

796
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,756
You gonna say hello, Decker,

797
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,514
or just creep
around the room?

798
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,915
Sorry, Lieutenant.
I didn't know

799
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,554
if you were sleeping or not.
I wanted to say

800
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,160
thank you for what you did.

801
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,400
It's just part of the job.
It's no big deal.

802
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,190
No, it's a huge deal.
You saved my life.

803
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,150
I'm so grateful.

804
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,710
And you saved mine.

805
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,071
We're even.

806
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,630
So have you ever been injured
on the job before?

807
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,355
I've had a few scrapes.

808
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,477
The possibility of death
has never felt...

809
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,160
so real before.

810
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,871
Yeah.

811
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,112
You know, when I was shot,
I was completely freaked out.

812
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,592
I kept thinking, like, how
could it all end so suddenly?

813
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,477
But the best thing I did was,
I went back to work, and

814
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,478
I just kept at it, you know?

815
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,480
'Cause you really do realize
life is so short.

816
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,840
And you have to just live it
while you can.

817
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,191
Speaking of work,
I-I should get back

818
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,000
and, uh, finish up
Blackcrow's arrest sheet.

819
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,469
Um, I-I don't know
if you heard, but he turned up

820
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,911
half-beaten, hogtied in Malibu.

821
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,670
Karma, I guess.

822
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,077
Anyhow,

823
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,960
thanks again for the...

824
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,154
whole lifesaving thing.

825
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,276
Couldn't let anything happen
to my best detective.

826
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,877
So now
I'm your <i>best</i> detective?

827
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,957
I didn't want you
to get all full of yourself.

828
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,311
I can see why
Lucifer's so affected by you.

829
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,839
It's because
you're special, Decker.

830
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,113
- Hey, Chloe.
- Hi.

831
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,511
Uh, Lieutenant,
I just wanted to say

832
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,440
that, um, I hope
you feel better soon.

833
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,070
Thanks, Espinoza.

834
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,754
I also wanted to thank you
for putting me up

835
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,236
for the union rep
position. Sorry, Chloe.

836
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,432
I know you wanted that one, too.

837
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,318
And I...

838
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,556
I won't let you down, sir.

839
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:42,917
I know you won't.

840
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,391
You earned it, buddy.

841
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,715
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

842
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,436
So, my guardian angel, I think
this calls for a celebration.

843
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,759
I was lucky you turned up
when you did.

844
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,440
How did you find me,
by the way?

845
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,431
Location service on one
of your dating apps.

846
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,237
Maybe luck had nothing to do
with when I showed up, Luci.

847
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,430
Maybe Father wanted me there.

848
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,958
You give him
way too much credit, Brother.

849
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,070
What's so funny?

850
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,277
Well, nothing.

851
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,551
It's just, it took you
walking a mile in my shoes

852
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,029
to prove my point to me.

853
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,959
Okay. And what point is that?

854
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,594
That I haven't changed.

855
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,037
Wings,

856
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,072
no wings,
unable to show my true face...

857
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,117
it doesn't matter.

858
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,756
I'm exactly
who I always was.

859
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,951
A punisher.

860
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,718
And for reminding me of that,
I salute you.

861
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,915
Oh, that's very kind of you.

862
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,834
But, you see,
I don't think it was the human

863
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,315
that you were trying
to punish today.

864
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,193
Well, who else would I be trying
to punish?

865
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,755
Yourself, Luci.

866
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,109
For not being there for Chloe
when she was in danger

867
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,152
because you care
about her deeply.

868
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,033
And if that truly is the case,

869
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,551
then you really have changed
from the old Lord of Hell.

870
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,278
But this is good, Luci.

871
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,719
This is so good.

872
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,878
Because I've finally figured out
how you are my test.

873
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,832
You see,
Father wants me to just...

874
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,517
just be there for you.

875
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,160
To have your back.

876
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,434
Now that you're evolving.

877
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,910
There was this, uh, soul that
I used to torture back in Hell.

878
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,192
And like a good masochist,
he'd call the shots.

879
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,599
"Burn me."
"Freeze me."

880
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,035
"Hurt me."

881
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,469
So, I did.

882
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,598
And this went on for centuries

883
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,592
until one day, for some reason,

884
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,599
he missed his daily punishment.

885
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,189
And when I returned...

886
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,790
he was crying.

887
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,115
"Please, my king," he said.

888
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,753
"Don't ever forget me again.

889
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,477
I promise I'll be good."

890
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,516
It was then that I realized
he was so full of self-loathing,

891
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,112
void of any
self-respect, that

892
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,154
no matter the depth
of my cruelty,

893
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,280
whatever miniscule attention
I paid...

894
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,797
gave meaning to his...

895
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,353
pointless existence.

896
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,119
Why are you telling me this?

897
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,552
Because he reminds me of you.

898
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,038
And you think I've changed?

899
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,237
You... the former angel,

900
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,598
powerless and pathetic,

901
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,952
a disgraced failure
with no better way

902
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,437
to spend your days than
yipping at my heels for scraps

903
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,350
to remind you of a time
of when you once mattered.

904
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,150
Hmm.

905
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,716
I know what you're doing.

906
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,395
And you can kill the messenger
if you must.

907
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,591
But just know
that I am here for you.
