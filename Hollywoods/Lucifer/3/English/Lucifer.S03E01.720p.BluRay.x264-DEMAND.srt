1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,549
<i>- Previously on</i> Lucifer...
<i>- So, you are the Devil,</i>

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,479
and you've left Hell behind

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,672
to take a vacation
in Los Angeles.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,996
Well, where else would I go?

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,157
I got it. I got it. The name.

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,470
The whole Lucifer thing.

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,955
And desire's, like,
your superpower.

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,634
Mm, it's more like
a gift from God, really.

9
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,957
My God. Your dad
did that to you?

10
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,714
No, that's where
I cut my wings off.

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,513
<i>Mum's powers are returning,</i>

12
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,518
and it won't be long
before we can't contain them.

13
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,552
I'm afraid that this ends now.

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,320
Bloody
hell, it worked!

15
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,999
- Who are you?
<i>- I should never have</i>

16
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,192
got you involved in any
of this from the start.

17
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,358
I just realized something
that I need to do.

18
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,198
<i>Detective,</i>

19
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,516
I'm coming over now

20
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,389
to tell you the truth about me.

21
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,920
Are you blind?

22
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,753
The day I've had, I tell you.

23
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,715
Right. I'd like a ride
to Los Angeles, please.

24
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,037
I... oh.

25
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,230
Dearie me.

26
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,760
At least I'm healing fast.

27
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,360
Do you have any aloe vera?

28
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,074
I ain't going back to L.A.

29
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,476
What...

30
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,880
Hold on, you're not a real
armored truck driver, are you?

31
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:06,992
Wait.

32
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,919
Don't I know you from somewhere?

33
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,591
Oh, yes, yes.

34
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,950
You're that jewelry thief,

35
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,197
the one who left in nothing
but his manties.

36
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,072
You!

37
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,279
You got me put in jail!

38
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,392
Uh, well, I think
that one's on you, sir.

39
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,910
- I wasn't the one with the gun and the ski mask.
- I'm not gonna

40
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,879
let you screw this up
for me again.

41
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,315
It's time for you to go.

42
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,239
Well, you are a tenacious one,

43
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,351
I'll give you that.

44
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,471
Respect.

45
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,239
You one
crazy-ass bitch.

46
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,910
Now, get out
of the truck.

47
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,349
Now.

48
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,917
Look...

49
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,157
I know you don't want
to shoot me, Mr...

50
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,111
What's your name?

51
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,630
- Said out, bitch.
- Mr. Said Out Bitch, tell me,

52
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,433
what is it you really desire?

53
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,472
I just want
to get out of here, man.

54
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,475
Right, freedom, of course.

55
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,956
That hasn't changed.

56
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,437
Well, then we might
be able to help each other.

57
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,636
Suspect heading towards us.

58
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,990
Prepare the blockade.

59
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,870
I can't see through.

60
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,832
- Eyes on.
- Easy, easy.

61
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,591
Don't move!

62
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,439
Hello, there.

63
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,558
Hands in the air!

64
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,910
That won't be necessary.

65
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,554
I'm Lucifer Morningstar,

66
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,240
consultant for the LAPD.

67
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,354
I've apprehended
this stolen vehicle

68
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,119
and all of its contents.

69
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,194
- You're welcome.
- Hands up!

70
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,153
- Down on the ground!
- Well, I'd really rather not.

71
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,158
I've just got into
some clean clothes.

72
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,840
Partner name and badge number!

73
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,077
Oh, for goodness' sake.
Detective Decker.

74
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,074
I'm afraid I don't know
her badge number.

75
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,760
- Detective Decker.
- But I'd say with certainty

76
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,111
she's a 34-B, if that helps.

77
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,834
Hot as hell out here, isn't it?

78
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,675
Well, close, anyway.

79
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,714
- Checks out.
- Well, of course

80
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,389
it does... I'm never wrong
when it comes to cup size.

81
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,111
Okay.

82
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,677
- Hold on! What'd you do with th <i>e real</i> thief?
- Well, unfortunately,

83
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,518
he got away.

84
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,631
But not to worry.

85
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,160
I don't think
he'll be bothering you

86
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,631
for a very, very long time.

87
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,875
Ah. Good.

88
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,551
You're here.

89
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,070
Well, I wasn't sure what
you fancied, so I ordered

90
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,197
a little of everything.

91
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,470
Thank you, Benjamin.

92
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,520
Lucifer, what is all of this?

93
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,632
This is your new
wellness regime.

94
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,395
I thought since
I was responsible

95
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,398
for your current state, the
least I could do is heal you.

96
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,440
And yes, Benjamin is part
of the package.

97
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,080
He'll be back after dark.

98
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,079
Oh, well, don't worry,
he'll be gentle.

99
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,277
Mm.

100
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,119
What? I just want
to take care of you.

101
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,310
Is that so hard to believe?

102
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,516
Yes. Out with it.

103
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,955
What's going on?

104
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,559
Talk about
insult to injury.

105
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,231
I-I-I didn't know
that they could grow back.

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,638
Are wings

107
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,400
like... body hair?

108
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,560
No. Don't be so ridiculous.

109
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,070
This is Dad's
latest stunt.

110
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,272
A celestial spanking,
if you will.

111
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,631
I suppose that's what I get for
giving Mum her own universe.

112
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,076
Holy crap!

113
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,396
Exactly.

114
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,160
Mm. But it's no biggie.

115
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,230
I cut them off once,
and I can cut them off again.

116
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,233
Now, I'd have Maze do it,
but she's off

117
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,874
bounty hunting
again, and...

118
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,591
well, I thought, what,
with your medical expertise

119
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,917
- and training...
- Even if I <i>was</i>

120
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,440
that kind of doctor,
I'm pretty sure

121
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,996
- they're not teaching wing-ectomies in med school.
- No, no, no,

122
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,431
it's quite simple...
it's just snip, snip, and Bob's your uncle.

123
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,552
Well, God's your Father,
Lucifer.

124
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,353
And things are never
simple with Him.

125
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,950
You don't know why for sure
your wings have returned.

126
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,236
They've returned

127
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,318
because Dad is a control freak.

128
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,716
He's pissed off
that He can't get Mum back,

129
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,513
so He stuck my wings back on.

130
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,872
But I am not
His Mr. Potato Head.

131
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,276
And don't worry, I fully plan
to track down Dad's emissary

132
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,790
on Earth, and give him
a return message. But for now...

133
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,072
Emissary? You think God sent
someone to do this to you?

134
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,356
Never mind all that.

135
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,233
Right now I need you to help me.

136
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,954
So come on, chop-chop.

137
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,991
No.

138
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,274
As your therapist,
I'm sorry,

139
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,634
but I can't do this.

140
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,479
- Well, as a friend, then.
- Yes, as a friend

141
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,673
who got caught in the
crossfire, I beg you, please,

142
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,714
think this through
before you do something rash.

143
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:10,952
I...

144
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,318
I almost died
because of your family drama.

145
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,950
Right.

146
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,194
But you can definitely
text me Ben's number, though.

147
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,835
Okay.

148
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,515
Oh, gosh, it's hard enough
just to scratch your own back.

149
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,717
Right, it's okay, it's okay, you
can call off the search party.

150
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,474
I'm unharmed.

151
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,510
Sup, wimp?

152
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,916
Detective, Detective,
I am so sorry.

153
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,191
You must have been
so worried in my absence.

154
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,914
Your absence? I saw
you two days ago.

155
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,117
I thought you were just avoiding
meeting the new lieutenant.

156
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,754
New who? Never mind,
I don't care.

157
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,713
We've got something much more
important we need to discuss.

158
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,559
Oh, is this about
the message you left?

159
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,632
Message? Oh, right.

160
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,712
Uh, well, we will talk
about that later,

161
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,350
but right now we need
to figure out who kidnapped me.

162
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,711
Kidnapped you?

163
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,993
Okay, I'll play.
Who kidnapped you?

164
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,156
I don't know.

165
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,270
Well, what did they look like?

166
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,357
I don't know.

167
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,037
L-L-Look,

168
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,833
I'm fairly certain that
my Father's behind it.

169
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,796
Your father kidnapped you?

170
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,400
Well, no, not
Him personally.

171
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,512
God never gets His own
hands dirty, does He?

172
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,996
Uh-huh.

173
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,111
You don't believe me.

174
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,510
Uh-huh. Sorry.

175
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,030
- This is just a little far-fetched, even for you.
- Right.

176
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,396
- Okay, fine.
- Mm-hmm.

177
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,994
I'll take you to the
scene of the crime.

178
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,430
Come on.
Come on!

179
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,990
Yes, I'm sure.

180
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,998
It's just... past this shrub.

181
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,233
Well, I don't
see anything.

182
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,030
What? I...

183
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,280
Ah! Ha-ha! Footprints.

184
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,391
Those are mine.

185
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,754
Oh. Well...

186
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,114
well, then the wind
must have blown

187
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,430
the crime scene bare, Detective,

188
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,756
because I am not lying.

189
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,077
Someone kidnapped me.
I was outside the hospital,

190
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,555
leaving you a message,
and someone stashed me...

191
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,750
So this <i>was</i> about that message.

192
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,877
Look, Lucifer,

193
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,800
if you regret what you said,
if this kidnapping tale

194
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,469
is some elaborate distraction,
you can just stop.

195
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,794
All right? You don't need
to tell me anything.

196
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,276
- I'm no stranger to the drunken dial.
- Yes, I have been known

197
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,359
to avoid the issue at times,
but that is not the case here.

198
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,270
Detective, I swear, this is
the scene of a despicable crime.

199
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,832
What?

200
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,238
I...

201
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,234
I believe you.

202
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,632
Soaked in sweat,
parched and starving,

203
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,112
he scraped, clawed his way
towards the light,

204
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,674
but, ironically,

205
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,917
the only thing stronger
than his desperate desire

206
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,355
to live was...

207
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,472
the sun... its relentless heat

208
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,354
literally cooking him,
until one last...

209
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,437
breath...

210
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,756
and he's gone.

211
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,316
Tragic. But, now, can we
please get on with it?

212
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,393
Whoever killed this
dehydrated sap

213
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,552
is clearly responsible
for my devil-napping.

214
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,797
I mean, the location's
far too coincidental.

215
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,077
Who is he, and
what does he

216
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,237
- have to do with me?
- Steve Banales.

217
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,200
Owner and CEO
of Angelette Hotel.

218
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,193
Steve Banales.
That's strange.

219
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,590
Never heard of him.

220
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,439
You'd think we'd have
some kind of connection.

221
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,749
I suppose we'll get more answers
once we find our assailant.

222
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,516
Hey, Jerry. I think
I found some footprints.

223
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,279
What?
No, those are mine.

224
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,278
Amateurs.

225
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,551
How did we get stuck with
the "B" team, anyway?

226
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,592
Lucifer, this is Lancaster PD.

227
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,359
The crime scene is
on the L.A. border,

228
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,835
so they're here helping.

229
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,872
I mean, I think
they're doing a great job.

230
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,515
Geez. These Lancaster guys
are a bunch of tools.

231
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,758
Oh.

232
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,155
Speaking of
tools, whoa, whoa.

233
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,158
Whoa, hey, Detective? Detective?

234
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,798
- So, what'd you find?
- Looks like a key chain.

235
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,511
Hey, guys, look at this.

236
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,792
Finally. A clue.

237
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,917
An "A"?

238
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,874
- Right. Off we go, Ms. Lopez.
- Oh, uh,

239
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,912
hold up, bud. I need to do
one more lap of the scene.

240
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,032
Want to make sure we
didn't miss anything.

241
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,158
I mean, not that I
don't trust Lancaster.

242
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,511
I just don't want to
disappoint our new lieutenant.

243
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,074
Oh, my gosh, you
guys, did I tell you

244
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,556
that I saw Lieutenant Pierce
speak at a conference last year?

245
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,435
"The Red Tape
Beyond the Yellow Tape."

246
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,437
Riveting.

247
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,671
- Sounds it.
- Yeah, you told us.

248
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,592
Yup, you did.

249
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,194
Anyway, big fan.

250
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,517
The guy is a
serious rock star.

251
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,870
I can't believe he
transferred here.

252
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,514
We are <i>so</i> lucky.

253
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,355
And I hear he's a total
sweetie pants to boot.

254
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,239
I'm Lieutenant Marcus Pierce.

255
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,640
All right, back to it.

256
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,913
Uh, Detective Daniel Espinoza.

257
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,474
Heard a lot about you,
Lieutenant,

258
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,871
and I'm really excited
to work with you.

259
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,673
I wish I could
say the same.

260
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,478
Aren't you that corrupt cop
that got off easy?

261
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,676
Excuse me?

262
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,076
No. Excuse me.

263
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,994
You must be Lucifer.

264
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,753
Morningstar.
Pleasure.

265
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,639
There was an investigation
last year.

266
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,919
We interviewed... what was it...
92 of your sexual partners?

267
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,080
I think I'll refrain
from physical contact

268
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,231
if you don't mind.

269
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,519
You don't seem reckless.

270
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,712
- Narcissistic, hedonistic... that I see.
- Well, thank you very much.

271
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,957
Not a compliment. Your file
is as long as my Johnson.

272
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,310
Oh. Quick read then?

273
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,874
- Hardly.
- Well, I, for one,

274
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,196
don't need a file to ascertain

275
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,915
you haven't even had a snog
in ages, have you?

276
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,471
Accurate.

277
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,392
Okay!

278
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,638
Hi. I am
Detective Decker.

279
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,400
Lucifer's partner. I know.

280
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,994
Actually, he's mine.

281
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,157
Uh, uh, consultant,
to be exact.

282
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,358
- That's what I said.
- But, uh...

283
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,520
Well?

284
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,275
Isn't he amazing?

285
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,510
We just had the
best conversation

286
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,120
over the doughnuts
I brought for him...

287
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,639
everyone, not
just him. I'm not

288
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,990
- kissing ass or anything.
- Mm-hmm.

289
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,072
Doughnuts for everyone!
Doughnuts!

290
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,310
- Right.
- Wow.

291
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,113
- Wow.
- Lucifer.

292
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,233
I've been looking
all over for you.

293
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,478
Uh, through here. Go.

294
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,516
So what happened?

295
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,234
It was terrible, Brother.

296
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,756
I was kidnapped.

297
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,755
No, Luci. I meant Mom.

298
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,159
Ah. Well, didn't
you get my text?

299
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,239
What? You mean the string
of nonsensical emojis?

300
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,677
Fire, sword, doughnut, spaceman,

301
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,952
clock, dancing lady,
flashlight, thumbs up.

302
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,875
How am I supposed
to know what that means?

303
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,400
I ignited the
flaming sword,

304
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,432
used it to cut a hole
in space and time,

305
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,676
Mum's light
flooded through it,

306
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,633
then it closed up
behind her. All good!

307
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,633
Mom's... Mom is gone?

308
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,196
Yes.

309
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,996
Yes. I mean, she
says good-bye forever,

310
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,637
she loves you very much,
et cetera, et cetera, but

311
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,480
the good news is...

312
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,954
you get your necklace back.

313
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,471
And we all know how
attached to that you are.

314
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,593
So, back to more
current issues.

315
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,756
Me and my kidnapping.

316
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,713
Now, clearly Dad is behind it,

317
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,434
but the question is,
who's his emissary,

318
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,597
and how were they able
to render me unconscious?

319
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,632
Either they used some kind
of celestial weapon,

320
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,274
or the detective was nearby.

321
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,277
And if it's the latter,
then it has

322
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,358
to be someone who knows
she makes me vulnerable.

323
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,717
Hang on.

324
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,592
The "A" on the key chain
is for Amenadiel, isn't it?

325
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,310
- What?
- Of course.

326
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,955
It's you!
Now that God's favorite son's

327
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,312
regained his powers, he's back
to being his little bitch.

328
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,432
Luci,
I didn't get my powers back.

329
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,714
Yes, I was able
to slow time, but...

330
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,911
uh, that appears
to have been a one-time thing.

331
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,511
But... you have got
your wings back, huh?

332
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,312
No.

333
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,516
Not yet.

334
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,390
Well, isn't that ironic?

335
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,671
You want your wings back
and didn't get them, and...

336
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:32,998
I...

337
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,110
get whacked over the head
and hauled out to the desert.

338
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,351
That's not ironic.

339
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,755
Well, not ironic <i>ironic.</i>

340
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,992
More...
Alanis Morissette ironic.

341
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,917
Anyway, the point is,

342
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,316
I'm sure your full powers
will come back in no time.

343
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,398
You probably
just need... a good nap.

344
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,478
Or eat some mangoes.
I've heard they work wonders.

345
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,359
- What?
- We got a suspect.

346
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,830
Prints on the key chain.

347
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,713
First, it looked like
it had been wiped down.

348
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,516
Then, I whipped out the color
fluorescent film, and whammo.

349
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,712
- Well done, Miss Lopez...
- Mm-hmm.

350
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,557
Oh, sorry.
We haven't officially met yet.

351
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,477
I'm Ella.

352
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,796
- Amenadiel.
- I mean,

353
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,279
I've seen you around, doing your
handsome broody thing, but...

354
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,872
Anyway, any bro
of Lucifer's is a bro of mine.

355
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,872
Whoa.

356
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,437
Someone works out.

357
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,712
Now I know who carries

358
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,872
- the guns in the family.
- Right, yes.

359
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,356
Enough of that.
We have a suspect. Shall we?

360
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,756
Oh, Brother?

361
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,553
About your problem... Yeah.

362
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,434
I think I might have
just the remedy.

363
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,239
I'll text you the info later.

364
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,397
Words this time, please!

365
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,909
Josh Hamid,
the victim's business partner.

366
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,196
The two own this hotel.

367
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,591
Well, this is a mug shot.

368
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,631
Has he got a record?

369
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,071
Yeah. Possession
of an exotic animal.

370
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,157
A tiger, I think.

371
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,635
Oh, that's
illegal? Too bad.

372
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,917
Yeah, anyhow, looks like

373
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,391
Josh and Steve both come
from family money.

374
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,791
Basically bought this hotel
just to have a place to party.

375
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,593
Imagine, buying
your own establishment

376
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,991
just to justify your
decadent lifestyle.

377
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,515
It's absurd.

378
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,679
Yeah. Absurd.

379
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:21,837
Thank you.

380
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,390
Josh Hamid?

381
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,431
Who wants to know?

382
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,592
Detective Decker, LAPD.

383
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,393
I imagine you
recognize me.

384
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,552
You got a nice set of cans
for a cop.

385
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,955
Right.
Whilst I don't disagree,

386
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,355
that is incredibly
disrespectful.

387
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,789
Perhaps I should teach you
some manners.

388
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,753
Lucifer, I got this.

389
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,309
Got a nice ass, too.

390
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,638
Yeah? Well, I also got these,

391
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,157
and your sorry ass is a suspect
in the Steve Banales murder.

392
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,835
I told you
Steve was up to something.

393
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,391
You want to cuff me, honey?

394
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,917
You're gonna have to catch me.

395
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,830
Excuse me.

396
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,678
Oh, you've got a gun.

397
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,155
Scary.

398
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,159
Hey, you tell Steve
I am officially impressed.

399
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,476
You think this is funny?!

400
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,234
Lucifer!

401
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,437
Well, maybe
it's a bit funny.

402
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,076
So, Josh...

403
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,595
Why did you kidnap me?!

404
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,120
I swear, I've never seen you

405
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,158
before you tried
to kill me today!

406
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,476
Really, Joshy.

407
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,909
Excuse us.

408
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,197
What?

409
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,591
- What are you doing?
- Consulting.

410
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,154
Then consult less.

411
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,512
So you say you don't
recognize Lucifer,

412
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,031
but you do admit to knowing
Steve Banales, correct?

413
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,879
Then did you do this to him?

414
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,438
This is a joke, right?

415
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,114
We found this at
the crime scene

416
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,549
with your fingerprints
all over it.

417
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,229
I didn't kill Steve, man!
I would never!

418
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,270
That's the key I gave
to the fake kidnappers.

419
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,636
- Fake?
- Yeah.

420
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,678
They get paid to abduct people.

421
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,360
I hired them for Steve.

422
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,835
- It's our thing.
- What?

423
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,999
- To torture each other?
- No! To pull pranks.

424
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,591
The more money we made,
the crazier the prank.

425
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,555
The fake kidnapping
was retaliation

426
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,071
for the tiger
Steve... put in my backyard.

427
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,915
What's the name
of the company?

428
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,270
Snaatched.

429
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,910
Super under the radar.

430
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,554
I-I got the deluxe package.

431
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,234
Ah. Well, they delivered.

432
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,591
They were supposed
to nab Steve for 48 hours,

433
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,429
tie him up in a warehouse,

434
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,679
stick him in the desert,
and then drop him back

435
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,394
at the hotel.
When he didn't show,

436
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,838
I just assumed he was...
busy planning payback.

437
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,430
It's why I thought
you weren't real cops.

438
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,832
I mean, a guy named Lucifer and
the chick from <i>Hot Tub Hotel?</i>

439
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,520
High School. <i>Hot Tub High School.</i>

440
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,676
She wasn't in the sequel.

441
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,554
I'm sorry.
Anyway, can you blame me?

442
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,717
Look, here's the
thing, Joshy.

443
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,520
I can assure you
we are quite real,

444
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,234
and by the looks of it,
so are your kidnappers,

445
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,909
so tell us what you know
about this Snaatched.

446
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,558
All right, Luci,
I got your text.

447
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,436
What's this magical remedy
of yours?

448
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,880
Hi. I'm Remedy.

449
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,953
I'm here to rub you.

450
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,477
Uh, give you a massage.

451
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,076
Oh.

452
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,600
Well, why not?

453
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,073
Lovely. Um, please
remove your clothing

454
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,033
and get under the towel.

455
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,040
We're gonna need a bigger towel.

456
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,470
I know where they are.

457
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,036
I'll be right back.

458
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,230
Oh, man.
I searched the IP address,

459
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,920
like, a zillion times
and it keeps pinging

460
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,560
to some random Russian server.

461
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,150
Surely there's some other way
to track these miscreants.

462
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,840
Something we missed
at the crime scene perhaps?

463
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,191
I wish. All we found there
was that key chain

464
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,356
and our second victim.

465
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,956
- Wait. Second victim?
- Leo.

466
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,272
Once a vibrant rock squirrel.

467
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,030
Now... roadkill.

468
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,269
Judging from his
time of death,

469
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,718
about 16 hours before
Steve died of dehydration.

470
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,149
It's pretty likely
the kidnappers

471
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,516
- are the ones who ran him over.
- Mm-hmm.

472
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,313
Poor guy never even
saw it coming.

473
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,352
So, did you lift
any tire treads?

474
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,670
Sure did.

475
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,317
Leo was squashed by a
Ryuk Road Crusher tire.

476
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,351
Commercial grade.

477
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,995
Only 850,000
sets produced.

478
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,515
- In the world?
- Nope.

479
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,360
- In L.A.
- Oh, for goodness' sakes.

480
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,432
You know, there
still is one angle

481
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,393
that we haven't
quite explored yet.

482
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,512
And that is your
connection to the case.

483
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,877
Oh, and I wasn't sure
you thought there was one.

484
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,436
Well, I'm still not sure I do,
but we're stuck,

485
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,390
so do you think your kidnapping
was intended as a prank?

486
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,233
Or to actually
hurt you, like Steve?

487
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,597
Definitely the latter.

488
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,280
My Father is not a jokester.

489
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,471
Right.

490
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,990
Right. So, say
your father

491
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,634
did hire
these fake kidnappers...

492
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,274
- He did.
- ...to...

493
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,830
- Hmm.
- Any idea why?

494
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,555
Of course. He's angry that
I gave Mum her own universe.

495
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,958
I mean, nothing pisses God off
more than exercising free will.

496
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,192
- I am trying to believe you here.
- something horrid

497
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,357
happened to me and I woke up
in the desert with my bloody...

498
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,072
wi...

499
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,476
What?

500
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,991
Okay, Detective.
I understand your confusion.

501
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,839
And, although I've told you
the truth from the beginning,

502
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,235
you're a woman
of logic and reason.

503
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,150
And... that-that is why
I left you that message.

504
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,710
You require proof.

505
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,278
And I suppose now is as good a
time as any to give it to you.

506
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,039
So perhaps you should sit.

507
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,876
Okay.

508
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,069
Mm-hmm.

509
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,594
Oh, right.

510
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,031
Yeah. Maybe I
should... leave.

511
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,709
You know, uh, third wheel.

512
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,754
Watch out.

513
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,511
Okay.

514
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,719
Lucifer, just show me what
you need to show me.

515
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,434
You know, I don't need
anything to drink.

516
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,995
Well, I do.

517
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,715
I have tried to be
honest with you,

518
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,238
but if I'm being honest
with myself,

519
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,269
and I have held the
real truth back from you,

520
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,115
and you, of all people,
deserve to know that, Detective.

521
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,750
Which is why I want to show you.

522
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,557
Lucifer, whatever it is

523
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,520
that you want to show me

524
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,196
or that you want to tell me,
it's okay.

525
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,636
I'm here for you.

526
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,156
Okay.

527
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,991
Then, once and for all,

528
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,237
I'd like to show you
who I really am.

529
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,556
Okay.

530
00:24:59,200 --> 00:24:59,997
You ready?

531
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,916
Yeah.

532
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,679
Oh, my God. What?
Are you gassy?

533
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,556
Why is it not working?

534
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,790
Why isn't what working?

535
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,199
What? I don't understand.

536
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,796
I do.

537
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,716
You know, I keep caring,

538
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,429
and you... you just...

539
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:40,997
Just...

540
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,595
No, Detective! I...

541
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,551
I...

542
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,275
really am the Devil.

543
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,434
Well, that sucks.

544
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,239
Dead ends piss me off.

545
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,634
Which is why
I don't believe in them.

546
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,951
Now, these kidnappers might be
fake but they're not invisible.

547
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,389
There has to be a way
to find them.

548
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,670
You're right.

549
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,070
If Muhammad won't
come to the mountain,

550
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,509
the mountain must
go to Muhammad.

551
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,200
I have no idea what that means,
Decker.

552
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,754
Well, someone needs
to get kidnapped.

553
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,110
Now, there's an idea.

554
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,436
That I was just suggesting.

555
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,910
No one likes a credit hog,
Decker.

556
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:20,837
Now, who would be the bait?

557
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,156
Well, I'd like to volunteer.

558
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,191
Uh, it's not a good idea.

559
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,993
If these are the same
guys that abducted,

560
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,237
allegedly, Lucifer, they're
gonna recognize him.

561
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,551
Right. We need somebody
who's a lot less, well...

562
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,877
everything.

563
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,197
Esperanza.

564
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,915
Es-Espinoza.

565
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,952
And, sure, that makes,
uh, makes sense.

566
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,640
I have the most experience
in the field,

567
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,876
so if something
goes wrong, then...

568
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,991
You're expendable.

569
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,230
Exactly.

570
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,630
Thank you.

571
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,397
Now go get kidnapped,
Esperanza.

572
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,519
Hey, excuse me, I was wondering
if I could get a...

573
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,557
We're closed.

574
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,870
We ran out of meat.

575
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:00,872
All right, Daniel.

576
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,434
You're not allergic to gerbils,
are you?

577
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,034
Just making some
last-minute adjustments

578
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,310
to the questionnaire.

579
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,191
Hilarious.

580
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,278
Hey, Lucifer, did you
set up the pickup point?

581
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,920
Yes. Tour bus pickup.

582
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,758
Olvera Street.

583
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,360
Exactly one half hour
from now.

584
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,636
All right, good.

585
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,550
Hey. You know the team

586
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,797
will intervene before
anyone gets hurt, yeah?

587
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,197
Yeah.

588
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,231
Okay.

589
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,193
Look, if you're upset about
what the lieutenant said,

590
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,072
you're not alone.

591
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,634
He's not a fan
of mine, either.

592
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,156
And I still can't believe he
called me "Lucifer's partner."

593
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,635
You are my partner!

594
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,358
You know, the truth is,
I am feeling expendable.

595
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,153
- Why?
- It's not because Pierce said it.

596
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,875
It's because of Charlotte.

597
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,951
Oh.

598
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,234
Yeah, after everything
that happened at the beach,

599
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,233
she's acting like she
doesn't even know me.

600
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,753
I'm not an idiot, I know
she was using me at first,

601
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,913
but... but then it seemed
like she actually cared.

602
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,080
- Well, um...
- Whatever.

603
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,595
I'll get over it.

604
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,870
I'm sorry, Dan.

605
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,400
Yes, I'm sorry,
too, Daniel,

606
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,751
that I can't hear you.
Could you speak up, please?

607
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,796
T minus 20, people.

608
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,320
Take your mark, Espinoza.

609
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,518
Right, I'll check in with
McMillian at the lookout point.

610
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,710
Okay.

611
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,430
Uh, Daniel.

612
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,556
- Listen, uh...
- Come on.

613
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,757
Oh, right.
Undercover, yes.

614
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,356
Listen, I know you were
talking about Charlotte.

615
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,917
And as douchey as you may be,
and I know you can't help it,

616
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,710
her current behavior has
nothing to do with you, okay?

617
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,560
And as much as I
appreciate the pep talk,

618
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,399
Lucifer, it was kinda
you that got me

619
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,193
in the whole Charlotte mess
in the first place.

620
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,830
So maybe you should just

621
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,111
take care of your side of the
street for a change, all right?

622
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,276
Good talk.

623
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,799
My side of the street.

624
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,478
That's a good idea.

625
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,550
Leo?

626
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,237
Oh.

627
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,354
Hey. I'm sorry to bother you,

628
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,239
but do you have any idea
where my brother went?

629
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,079
He's ignoring
my phone calls.

630
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,920
Oh, bud, no, no, no.
He's totally not ignoring you.

631
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,511
He's just in the middle
of this sting operation.

632
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,071
Oh.

633
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,470
Can I help?

634
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,239
That's very nice of you, but no.

635
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,349
It's personal.

636
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,316
You a believer?

637
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,998
Well, then, whatever it is
you're going through,

638
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,559
I'm sure it's all part
of His plan.

639
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,315
I mean, even the most

640
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,592
pathetic, sad sack, powerless of
creatures serve a purpose.

641
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,957
Like Leo here.

642
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,673
A van may have cracked his nuts
in the middle of the desert,

643
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,440
but he's still
valuable evidence.

644
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,597
That's the thing.
You never know

645
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,713
when your rock-bottom pain
and humiliation

646
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,434
can end up helping others.

647
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,195
I mean, God works
in mysterious ways.

648
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,598
So you just got to believe
that when He crushes your nuts,

649
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,996
He does it for a reason.

650
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,356
Has this, um,

651
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,156
Leo provided you with
a break in your case?

652
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,310
Not yet.

653
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,593
But you got
to have faith, right?

654
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,196
Right. Right.

655
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,431
The kidnappers
are seven minutes late.

656
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,235
Yeah, well, we didn't give them
a lot of prep time; don't worry.

657
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:36,951
I'm worried.

658
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:37,912
Where are they?

659
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,156
They'll be here.

660
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,596
Come on.

661
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,393
Come on, be here. Be here.

662
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,592
Oh, lovely.
Right on time.

663
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,959
Hello. Right. How do we do...

664
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,873
Oh, careful. I bruise
like a peach.

665
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,831
Easy.

666
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,799
Seriously?

667
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,156
Ah, there you are.

668
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,191
I have to say, the leaky pipe
is a nice touch.

669
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,153
Very <i>Blood Simple.</i>

670
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,556
Coen Brothers movie?

671
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,310
No?

672
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,791
Oh.

673
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,037
Well,

674
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,114
hello, kidnappers.

675
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,472
Finally, I have you
right where I want you.

676
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,032
Let's see,
so many questions,

677
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,800
How did
you abduct me the first time?

678
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,832
Hmm? How did you
render me unconscious?

679
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,872
Ow. What are you doing?

680
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,719
Stop it, that tickles.

681
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,110
We used this
last week, right?

682
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,197
Yeah.

683
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,436
Did you forget
to charge it?

684
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,154
No. I didn't forget
to charge it.

685
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,193
Dude.

686
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,153
- Not cool.
- I just don't get it.

687
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,510
- I don't know.
- I hate to interrupt.

688
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,790
Where were we?

689
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,520
Remind me not to leave Lucifer
in the front seat unattended.

690
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,316
And remind me
to kick his ass

691
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,034
for humiliating me
in front of Pierce.

692
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,879
Well, I'll help you
if we can find him.

693
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:34,831
Look...

694
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,716
don't worry, Chloe.

695
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,320
Lucifer can take
care of himself.

696
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,876
Found Lucifer's phone...

697
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,673
in some bushes
on Alameda Street.

698
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,916
Kidnappers must have
tossed it.

699
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,270
What about, uh, traffic cams?

700
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,352
- Maybe we can pull a plate number.
- No.

701
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,075
I checked everything
within a mile radius. Nada.

702
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,834
Must have grabbed him
in a blind spot.

703
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,318
Unfortunately,

704
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,273
I think we're dealing with
some pretty crafty bad guys.

705
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,072
<i>I...</i>

706
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,152
can't... breathe!

707
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,276
Please don't crush him.
We've only just begun.

708
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,109
Oh, come on, man.
Ask us anything!

709
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,157
All right.

710
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,553
My face...
how did you do it?

711
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,598
- What?!
- Well, the wings are one thing,

712
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,038
but my Devil face...
how did you take that?

713
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,318
We've never seen
you before, man!

714
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,277
Yeah, man.

715
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,994
Never heard of you before today.

716
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,677
I just got a name...
Daniel LaDoosh... a pickup point,

717
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,473
and that you got a thing
for gerbils.

718
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,878
I suppose you also deny abducting Mr. Banales

719
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,037
and leaving him to perish
in the desert, do you?

720
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,232
He's the client
from last week, man!

721
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,317
Right, man.

722
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,193
His friend got him
the deluxe package.

723
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,675
We did the
detail work here,

724
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,200
and then our partner Sam
picked him up,

725
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,880
took him to the spider hole
for a few hours,

726
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,998
- and dropped him back off at the hotel.
- Well, then,

727
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,714
it seems
your colleague took a detour.

728
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,950
Where does this Sam live?

729
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,037
Koreatown!

730
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,311
It's a pink building on Leeward.

731
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,274
- Apartment?
- 5B, man! 5B!

732
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,353
Lovely. Thanks for your help.

733
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,951
Hey, man!

734
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,674
Will you let us go,
man?

735
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,476
So,
prints off the key chain led to Josh.

736
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,189
Right.
Tire treads on the roadkill led to nothing.

737
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,959
There's got to be
something we're missing.

738
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,640
Maybe Lancaster has something.

739
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,591
We're screwed.

740
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,790
Or not.

741
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,275
Remember the detective
who found the key chain?

742
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,756
He doesn't exist, at least
not at Lancaster PD.

743
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,680
They only sent patrol
units to the scene.

744
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,872
Whoa. You think
that was our guy?

745
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,954
Killers often return to
the scene of the crime.

746
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:22,792
Which means

747
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,076
he wasn't finding evidence.

748
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,077
He was trying to steal it.

749
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,472
Should have known.

750
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,352
Why should you have known?

751
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,074
Lancaster doesn't know us,
we don't know them.

752
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,237
Look, let's just look through
these photos, try and find him

753
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,796
- in the background, okay?
- Yes, and then we can nail his ass

754
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,593
with facial
recognition software.

755
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,236
Here he is.

756
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,035
But his back's to us.

757
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,997
You guys... oh, my gosh.

758
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,879
I knew... I knew
he didn't die in vain.

759
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,400
- What?
- Who?

760
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,834
Leo. See, look.

761
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,238
There's our suspect,
right, leaving the scene,

762
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,358
walking towards that van.

763
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,913
Ryuk Road Crusher tires.

764
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,037
Commercial grade.

765
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,158
That's the van
that ran over Leo.

766
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,511
I mean, this
pretty much confirms

767
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,756
- that this guy's our killer.
- Okay.

768
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,155
So maybe we can
get an ID.

769
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,714
Let's run
the license plate.

770
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,995
Remember me?

771
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,720
It's you.

772
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,676
Yes.

773
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,475
You know me as the Devil you so
rudely turned into an angel

774
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,955
and then dumped
in the middle of the desert,

775
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,480
but I don't know you,
so, come on,

776
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,591
introduce yourself.

777
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,433
- I'm Sam.
- Yes, yes,

778
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,313
I know that, but what are you?

779
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,352
And how did my Father
get his hooks into you?

780
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,311
Your father?

781
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,920
Oh, come on,
don't be coy.

782
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,071
Let me see.

783
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,990
Unless Dad got jiggy
with some celestial babe

784
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,271
after Mum, then
you're not my sibling,

785
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,830
so... demon. Hmm?

786
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,791
Changeling?

787
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,674
I work for
an extreme kidnapping company.

788
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,671
Snaatched.

789
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,314
Oh, do you now?
Well, do you know what?

790
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,840
It doesn't matter
what you are because...

791
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,315
this should take care of you.

792
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,431
Whoa! Whoa!

793
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,154
Whoa! I... I'm sorry.

794
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,794
I'm sorry I left you
in the desert.

795
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,911
I really am.

796
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,358
And I'm sorry I left
that Steve guy there, too.

797
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,518
I... He was just a routine gig.

798
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,910
I was gonna swap him for you,

799
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,879
but when I went to
pull you out of the van,

800
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,437
you... you had
friggin' wings, man!

801
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,757
Well, duh!
Wings that you put there

802
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,229
at the behest of my Father!

803
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,272
- Now stop lying!
- I'm not!

804
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,269
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

805
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,831
I swear.

806
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,394
And believe me,
I didn't want to run,

807
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,875
but you scared
the hell out of me.

808
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,230
Right, you listen, Sammy,

809
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,914
I know you're
just the messenger,

810
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,840
so why don't you deliver
a message on my behalf?

811
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,397
<i>I</i> define who I am, not Him.

812
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,511
Me!

813
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,359
Oh, bloody hell.

814
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,760
They're back, aren't they?

815
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,596
How?

816
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,393
How are you doing this?

817
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,472
Did my Father
give you some kind of totem?

818
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,397
A talisman?

819
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,080
- What?
- I'm telling you, I don't...

820
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,716
I don't know what's happening.

821
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,673
And I don't know your dad.

822
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,317
Unless, is your,
is your dad the Sinnerman?

823
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,910
Quite the opposite.
Who's the Sinnerman?

824
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:35,792
That's, that's who,

825
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,759
who hired me to kidnap you.

826
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,919
He's, he's, he's a scary dude.

827
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,550
Huge crime boss.
I owed him big time.

828
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,314
But because I didn't
finish the job,

829
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,556
I'm as good as dead now.

830
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,955
That's why I was running.

831
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,998
And where do I find
this Sinnerman?

832
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,435
You don't.

833
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,836
He finds you.

834
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,116
Lucifer?

835
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,632
Get up.

836
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,632
Up.

837
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,109
Come on, get up.

838
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,435
Put your hands
behind your back.

839
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,113
- What happened to you?
- I...

840
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,280
I don't know.

841
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,800
Decker, it ain't good.

842
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,352
Lieutenant, look, I-I know
what you're gonna say.

843
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,835
And, even though
we caught our guy,

844
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,112
Lucifer was way out of line,
and I-I don't disagree,

845
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,271
but here's what
you got to know

846
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,153
about our unorthodox methods...

847
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,397
- Detective, you...
- I am Lucifer's partner,

848
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,996
yes, you're right,
but you know what?

849
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,236
He's mine, too.

850
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,718
And, for whatever reason,
we make an effective team.

851
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,398
And will be even more so
when I stop investing

852
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,752
on a, um... personal level.

853
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,633
I am here to solve crimes.

854
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,475
Not to see his... his thing

855
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,592
or whatever, which is...

856
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,193
not something
that you need to know.

857
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,439
Right. Look, point is,

858
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,474
you can say what you want,
but I know I'm a good detective

859
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,751
and I have a damn good
solve rate to prove that.

860
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,831
Okay.

861
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,551
Okay.

862
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:16,911
Okay.

863
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,471
I just came down here

864
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,757
to let you know that your perp
has been released on bail.

865
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,717
Oh.

866
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,679
W-Wait, how is that possible?

867
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,717
Don't know.

868
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,150
Friends in high places, I guess.

869
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,476
But there's got to be something.

870
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,915
I mean, don't-don't you care?

871
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,711
You do what you can, Decker.

872
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,036
You can't save them all.

873
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,358
Oh.

874
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,318
But, um, good luck
with Lucifer's... thing

875
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,596
or whatever.

876
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,432
Oh, hello, Brother.

877
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,392
So, did Remedy cure
what ails you?

878
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,114
Did her massage
make anything

879
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,071
pop out?

880
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,674
Talking about your wings,
of course.

881
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,519
No, mine are still absent.

882
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,320
But yours, on the other hand...

883
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,590
Oh.

884
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,235
Lucifer, I'm not angry with you

885
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,796
that you somehow
got your wings back,

886
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,480
or even that you
cut them off again,

887
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,478
as foul as that may be.

888
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,754
I'm angry with myself.

889
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,234
Because somehow I made you feel

890
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,318
like you couldn't confide in me.

891
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,760
Well, comparing body parts
is never good for the male ego,

892
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,269
especially between brothers.

893
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,119
But that's just it, Luci.

894
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,469
My ego should never be an issue.

895
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,555
I am an angel.

896
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,230
A soldier of God.

897
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,874
His favorite son.

898
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,673
Oh, that's gonna be a thing,
isn't it?

899
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,429
Listen, Father, He...

900
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,838
works in mysterious ways.

901
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,197
I was tested once and I failed.

902
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,474
I'm not gonna fail again.

903
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,791
Because this time, I have faith.

904
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,159
Excellent.

905
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,678
And I suppose
this won't bother you.

906
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,391
But you...

907
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,591
you cut them off.

908
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,759
I did, but the pesky things
seem to be a bit more tenacious

909
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,996
this time around.

910
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,238
Well, like I said, I have faith.

911
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,713
I'm sure it's all
a part of God's plan.

912
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,513
Yes!

913
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,553
If you mean his plan
to continually manipulate

914
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,513
and control me, then agreed.

915
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,950
Because, by the way,

916
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,919
he didn't just
give my wings back,

917
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,753
he took my Devil face as well.

918
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,077
Luci, do you realize
what this means?

919
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,876
Perhaps Father is trying
to show you that,

920
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,554
that you've been forgiven.

921
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,797
What if I don't want
His forgiveness?

922
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,717
But, Brother,
if you can be redeemed,

923
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,915
that means that anyone can.

924
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,440
Now, isn't that divine?

925
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,278
I'm not sure that
this is divinity at work here.

926
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:27,349
Have you ever heard
of someone named the Sinnerman?

927
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,070
The Sinnerman?

928
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,317
<i>No.</i>

929
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,197
Why?

930
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,914
That's who kidnapped me.

931
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,471
<i>At first, I thought it was a...</i>

932
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:54,990
an emissary on Earth

933
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,078
working on Dad's behalf, but
then, the more I think about it,

934
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,316
the more I think...

935
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,991
maybe this isn't our Father
who art in Heaven at all.

936
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,476
<i>But something much,</i>

937
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,155
much darker.
