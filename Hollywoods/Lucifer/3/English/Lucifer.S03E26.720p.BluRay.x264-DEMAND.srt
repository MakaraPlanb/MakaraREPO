1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,230
Police! Stop!

2
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,033
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

3
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,434
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

4
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,757
<i>there was a world,</i>

5
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,078
<i>just like ours,
but with one small change</i>

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,478
<i>that changed everything.</i>

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,757
No!

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,956
Why the hell did you do that?
Why'd you go after him?

9
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,959
Damn it, Bonnie.
You should've let him get away.

10
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,599
Not on my watch.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,592
Cut!

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,517
Here you go, Chloe.

13
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,518
Where's that stunt guy?
Get him over here.

14
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,752
- Can I get a coffee?
- Damn it.

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,078
Damn it. We didn't
get it, did we? Here.

16
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,437
You okay?

17
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,150
Yeah, I just choked
on the stupid blood capsule.

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,397
- Hey, nice work.
- Thanks.

19
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,676
Did all the
squibs go off?

20
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,200
Yeah, it was sick.
You killed it.

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,595
This sequence is
gonna be amazing.

22
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,553
You know, you're gonna win one
of those stunt awards for this.

23
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,797
Well, especially after
you get the car chase.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,036
Not sure about that.

25
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,037
What, are you worried about me?

26
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,436
All I got to do is get up
to the top, do that burnout,

27
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,750
and then Debi's gonna take over.

28
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,838
N-No, it's-it's not you.
I'm just kind of...

29
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,154
not going to be
here for it.

30
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,756
Wait, what? Why?

31
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,430
I can't really talk
about it here,

32
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,869
but trust me,
it's a good thing.

33
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,840
Actually, me and some
friends are going out

34
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,072
to celebrate tonight.
Why don't you come?

35
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,430
I'll fill you in
on everything.

36
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,798
Well, I... you may be off the
hook, but I got to drive this

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,832
$6 million James Dean
Porsche tomorrow.

38
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,677
Come on.

39
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,951
One drink.

40
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,791
Thank you.

41
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,914
<i>Amazing what changing</i>

42
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,191
<i>one tiny detail can do.</i>

43
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,357
<i>A butterfly flaps its wings</i>

44
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,392
<i>and good friends are strangers.</i>

45
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,670
Hey, Stryder.

46
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,472
Charlotte Richards.

47
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,559
Ah, to what do I owe
this pleasure?

48
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,991
Oh, just making sure you're
not getting into trouble.

49
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,031
Oh, that's no fun.

50
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,197
Well, true, but it is
my job as your attorney.

51
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,949
And I also brought
some paperwork

52
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,799
for the Vegas Lux expansion.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,037
Oh, well, that is exciting.

54
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,117
Yes.

55
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,119
Shall we, um, go up
to the penthouse?

56
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,516
<i>The butterfly effect also works</i>

57
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,040
<i>on people who might have died</i>

58
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,790
<i>and been inhabited by,
say, your mom,</i>

59
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,480
<i>who now isn't.</i>

60
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,080
Mmm... Ooh.

61
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,199
We haven't had sex
before, have we?

62
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,279
No, trust me,
you would remember.

63
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,960
Oh, I'm sure I would.

64
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,030
Sorry, sorry...

65
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,990
but I'm not sure
I can do this.

66
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,392
Well, that's a first.

67
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,191
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no,
nothing like that.

68
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,840
That's impossible, frankly.

69
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,034
No... I can't believe
I'm saying this, but...

70
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,637
I'm not in the mood.

71
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,475
Still a first.

72
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,991
No, no, no. Don't get me wrong,
Charlotte, you are stunning.

73
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,276
Well, I know that.

74
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,357
Come on. What's wrong?

75
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,037
I don't know. Maybe I've been
in Los Angeles too long.

76
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,599
Perhaps I need to find
someplace new.

77
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,834
- Someplace like Las Vegas?
- Exactly.

78
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,073
Well, then, why don't we sign
these commencement papers?

79
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,629
Once you do that

80
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,194
and get me a down payment,

81
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,393
they will break ground
on Lux Las Vegas.

82
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,120
You'll be packing in no time.

83
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,119
Hmm, well, I am feeling
better already.

84
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,316
Is cash acceptable?

85
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,151
Sin City,
here we come.

86
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,840
You seem...

87
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,036
frustrated.

88
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,357
Yeah.

89
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,200
And I should be
happy, you know?

90
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,915
I... I should
be excited.

91
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,670
I-I'm shooting <i>Weaponizer 5</i> and
everything's going pretty great.

92
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,236
We have this huge
car chase coming up,

93
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,597
and I feel...

94
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,115
I feel bored.

95
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,870
It is the fifth time
you've played this role.

96
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,597
It'd be normal

97
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,919
if you didn't feel a
bit... disenchanted.

98
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,516
Yeah, you're right, you know?
Maybe I should try

99
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,592
and play a different role,
but there's not a lot of things

100
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,029
out there for me, you know?

101
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,916
- And I am good at playing a cop.
- You are.

102
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,993
- Mm.
- You know, maybe it's just a matter

103
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,316
of approaching it
with different eyes.

104
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,671
You've always
said that

105
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,714
you wanted to be a positive
role model for young women.

106
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,951
And you are.

107
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,678
Girls all over the world see
you on-screen, fighting crime,

108
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,157
and they're inspired.
Don't forget that.

109
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,110
You're right. Thank you.

110
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,873
God, it feels like
we're back in session.

111
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,831
I know.

112
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,076
And it's amazing how well

113
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,436
they replicated your old office.

114
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,676
Yeah, it's weird.

115
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,716
- Thank you.
- Yeah, well, don't forget,

116
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,673
you know, that you
inspired me, too, Chloe.

117
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,234
If it weren't for you,

118
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,557
<i>Doctor Linda</i> never
would have happened.

119
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,035
- Right?
- Yeah.

120
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,560
And if it
weren't for you,

121
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,951
I'd be crazy
and out of work.

122
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,318
But... uh, yeah,
I'm fine, I'm good.

123
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,989
I think it's just about finding
something that's challenging.

124
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,995
<i>People accuse me of being controlling.</i>

125
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,751
<i>And yes, I may have put Chloe
in Lucifer's path.</i>

126
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,840
<i>But what if I didn't?
Would they still get together?</i>

127
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,190
Excuse me.

128
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,599
Hey, buddy.

129
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,358
You know the expression,
"I don't care where you go,

130
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,950
but you can't drool
all over my banquette."

131
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,471
Hmm?

132
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,159
Come on, rise and shine.

133
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,999
Ugh, bloody hell.

134
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,715
<i>Normally it would be impossible</i>

135
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,560
<i>to get an answer
to that question, but I can.</i>

136
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,395
<i>Just one of the benefits
of being God.</i>

137
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,078
<i>It's amazing the effect
a family can have</i>

138
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,913
<i>on a man's moral compass.</i>

139
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,595
Yo, Nick, what do we got?

140
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,553
<i>Or in Dan Espinoza's case,</i>

141
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,593
<i>the lack of a family.</i>

142
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,359
Vic's a Hollywood
stunt guy.

143
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,599
Stryder Novac, 28.

144
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,790
Stabbed once to the chest.

145
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,156
Found this on the body.

146
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,031
Figured it didn't have
anything to do

147
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,390
with who killed him, right?

148
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,274
Hide it. You see all
these eyes on us?

149
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,476
Are we smart
or are we dumb?

150
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,035
- We're smart.
- We're smart. That's right. Okay.

151
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,717
Did you find
the murder weapon?

152
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,157
Not yet.

153
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,716
Who found the body?

154
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,599
Well, if it isn't
Detective Dildo of the LAPD.

155
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,957
You still out there
leaving crimes unsolved?

156
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,431
Come on, man, Delilah's case
was open-and-shut,

157
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,437
if that's what you mean.

158
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,630
Agree to disagree.

159
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,836
Just like this appears to be

160
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,116
a pretty cut-and-dried
bar fight.

161
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,075
Ah, yes, of course,
going for the easy answer.

162
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,880
But I know in my gut
that's not the case here.

163
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,437
- Really?
- Absolutely. And I need to prove it.

164
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,278
And why's that?

165
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,391
Because just this morning,

166
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,512
my Vegas expansion deal
was frozen

167
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,229
due to this unfortunate murder.

168
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,078
I get it.

169
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,555
You got to pin it
on somebody else

170
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,830
so that your brand stays clean.

171
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,838
I don't pin things on anyone.

172
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,117
I just want to find the truth

173
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,754
so the right person
is punished for their sins,

174
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,236
and since I know your
corrupt little organization

175
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,072
won't solve it...

176
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,436
Morningstar,
this is police business.

177
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,915
You better stay out of it,

178
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,551
or I swear to God,
you're gonna be sorry.

179
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,558
Must we bring my Father
into this?

180
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,910
Though, actually, I suppose

181
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,472
you two blowhards
might hit it off.

182
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,194
<i>My son and I...</i>

183
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,678
<i>Well, let's just say,</i>

184
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,991
<i>I don't think I could
change anything</i>

185
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,271
<i>that would make
our relationship less...</i>

186
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,070
<i>complicated.</i>

187
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,830
<i>But, then, fathers can have
a dramatic impact</i>

188
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,077
<i>on their children's lives,
can't they?</i>

189
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,356
<i>Take Chloe Decker.</i>

190
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,638
<i>Her dad died 20 years ago
of a gunshot wound.</i>

191
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,155
<i>That loss changed her,</i>

192
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,791
<i>inspired her to follow in
his footsteps and become a cop.</i>

193
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,151
<i>So what was that one
small thing I changed</i>

194
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,073
<i>that changed everything?</i>

195
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,750
<i>All I did was move a bullet
a few inches to the right,</i>

196
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,229
<i>and...</i>

197
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,351
Knock, knock.

198
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,550
Come in.

199
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,435
Oh, hey, Monkey!

200
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,594
How's my superstar doing?

201
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,519
- Hey, Dad.
- Aw, yeah.

202
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,713
So, tell me how the big
death scene went yesterday.

203
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,633
- Oh...
- Oh, before I forget,

204
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,633
your mother said to tell you
to tell them that...

205
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,200
Oh, to favor
my good side.

206
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,351
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I got it.

207
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,075
No, Dad, I'm a-actually here
about a friend.

208
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,274
Okay, Chlo, if this is
about some drug charge

209
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,517
for your co-star, I'm afraid
there's nothing I can do.

210
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,915
No, no, nothing like that.

211
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,077
Actually, a-a friend of mine
was killed last night.

212
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,710
The stuntman?

213
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,319
Oh, you knew him.
Oh, Monkey, I'm so sorry.

214
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,637
- I-I had no idea.
- It's okay. Thanks.

215
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,991
Dad, do you have
any clue what happened?

216
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,800
Well, it's early,
but it looks like a bar fight.

217
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,032
No, he wasn't looking
for a fight.

218
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,750
He was out celebrating.

219
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,150
Well, how do you know?

220
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,714
- Well, I was with him.
- You were?

221
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,031
Yeah, a bunch of us.
He just got his dream job,

222
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,913
driving for NASCAR,
and I just don't think

223
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,514
he would do anything
to screw that up.

224
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,149
Okay, but, look,

225
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,831
i-it's very hard to know
everything about somebody.

226
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,715
And the detective on the case
is pretty solid on his theory.

227
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,639
Okay, so maybe I could
talk to the detective.

228
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,480
Look, I'll pass on
what you told me,

229
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,314
but that's as close
as you're gonna get

230
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,119
to an active
murder investigation.

231
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,079
- Let me just ask him a few...
- No arguments.

232
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,591
Now, this is a lot more
dangerous in real life

233
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,359
than it is in the movies, honey.

234
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,717
Okay.

235
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,550
Hello?

236
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,039
We're closed!

237
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,391
It's just your friendly
neighborhood Devil.

238
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,398
Well...

239
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,074
hello, my little <i>chola.</i>

240
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,632
What'd you do, did you
grind the gears again?

241
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,753
Such an unfit parent

242
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,440
for such a sweet
little baby.

243
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,112
I should have stolen her
from you when I had the chance.

244
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,629
My car is perfectly fine.

245
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,194
I'm here about something else.

246
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,750
Something... delicate.

247
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,675
Well...

248
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,997
I've always thought of you as
someone with a pump-action,

249
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,396
- Ms. Lopez.
- Oh, you mean my little <i>mijo</i>?

250
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,240
It's not loaded.

251
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,440
Sound is all you need

252
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,710
to scare the hell
out of someone.

253
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,515
- Right.
- Well, anyone other than you.

254
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,040
So, why are you here?
What do you want?

255
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,029
Well, you know tools, and
I believe that I have seen

256
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,636
one of these
in your workshop before.

257
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,512
What is it?

258
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,995
It's a T-handled Torx driver.

259
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,429
Right. Of course it is.

260
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,956
Although the end of this one
looks like it's been sharpened.

261
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,958
Maybe to poke a hole
in something?

262
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,157
Well, I know <i>that</i> much.
It was used in my club

263
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,631
last night to poke a hole
in a now-dead young man.

264
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,160
It was used in a <i>murder?</i>

265
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,076
What are you, freakin' <i>loco?</i>

266
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,555
Why'd you let me get
my prints on it?

267
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,989
Just tell me where
it came from.

268
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,310
Oh, what, are you
a detective now?

269
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,194
Listen, my little greasy monkey,

270
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,832
why don't you tell me what you
know about this stabby thing,

271
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,554
and I won't tell
any actual detectives

272
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,234
about your
little enterprise here?

273
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,393
Like I said...

274
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,038
it's a Torx driver, okay?

275
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,038
Nine-inch, alloy steel...

276
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,079
This one looks like it came from
some sort of pro racer tool kit,

277
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,600
you know, like NASCAR.

278
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,276
- Well, how can you tell that?
- Number stamped on it

279
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,915
is the number
of the racer's car,

280
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,629
<i>and</i> the red tape wrapped
around the handle...

281
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,471
crews color-code stuff
they need for specific jobs.

282
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,114
They don't have time
to search for crap.

283
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,470
Oh? Clever.

284
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,273
Something else
was stamped on it, too.

285
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,994
But it looks like
it's been sanded off.

286
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,797
I might be able to dig it out.

287
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,360
Oh, wonderful.
You work on that,

288
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,994
and I'll go visit the
nearest racetrack.

289
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,477
Uh...

290
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,880
Yes, of course.
You humans...

291
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,072
you
love your money.

292
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,840
We sure do.

293
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,517
Pleasure doing business
with you, Mr. Morningstar.

294
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,115
Sorry. Authorized
personnel only.

295
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,989
Oh, I just have a few
questions regarding a murder.

296
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,837
Gotcha.

297
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,920
- Put this on.
- Huh?

298
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,391
Follow me.

299
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,840
LAPD's over here.

300
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,039
What, Detective Dildo
beat me to it?

301
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,750
This
lady's no dildo.

302
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,959
- Oh.
- This guy wants to see you.

303
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,833
Well, hello...

304
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,916
Detective.

305
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,592
Detective Bonnie Gennaro.
How can I help you?

306
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,272
You're investigating the
murder of Stryder Novac?

307
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,075
- That's right.
- Well, this case

308
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,720
seems to be in
very capable hands.

309
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,679
So off I go.

310
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,991
All right.

311
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,994
I mean, after all,
you did take down

312
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,277
the head of the Yakuza
in single-hand combat.

313
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,955
And defeat the
Armenian mob

314
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,072
in a rather spectacular
car chase through Rome...

315
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,114
although, strangely, it looked
a lot more like Vancouver to me.

316
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,549
I get it...
you know who I am.

317
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,871
Yes. And if any crime were to
occur in a hot tub, well...

318
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,150
Please, please,

319
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,680
don't mention that project.

320
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,439
I'm a big fan of your work,
Ms. Decker.

321
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,712
- Thank you.
- I don't understand... why are you here?

322
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,031
Is this research
for a role, or...

323
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,237
We're not on camera now, are we?
Where are they?

324
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,278
Well... if you must know,

325
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,836
I worked with Stryder.

326
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,111
- Oh.
- He was a really great guy, and...

327
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,674
I don't think that he died
in a simple bar fight.

328
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,918
- Really?
- He was gonna drive for NAsCAR

329
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,833
for the first time today...
more importantly,

330
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,316
he was gonna replace
Rex Wilson in his car.

331
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,035
I've heard of Wilson... he was
quite a famous driver years ago.

332
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,390
Yeah. He was huge.

333
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,313
But then this young guy comes
to take his place.

334
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,556
Point is,

335
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,750
thanks to Stryder's death,

336
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,874
Rex is still driving today.

337
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,309
Well, thank you
for the information.

338
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,000
Now I know who to throttle.
I'll take it from here.

339
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,395
Oh, you will, will you?

340
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,795
Who are you, anyhow?

341
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,275
Oh, I do apologize.
Where are my manners?

342
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,800
Lucifer Morningstar.

343
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,515
Oh, right.
The owner of Lux.

344
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,870
- Mm.
- Well, I'd love to leave this

345
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,356
in the no-doubt capable hands
of a boozy,

346
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,074
half-in-the-bag club owner...

347
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,510
Oh.

348
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,790
I have got this.

349
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,320
Really? I think
you'll find

350
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,352
all you've got,
Ms. Decker, is a badge

351
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,552
which reads "Property
of Warner Bros."

352
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,637
I've not only played a cop
in five movies...

353
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,478
...I come from a family of them.

354
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,959
And I can assure you,
I can handle this

355
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,038
<i>way</i> better than you can.

356
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,277
Oh. You can't even
get into the pits.

357
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,834
Detective Gennaro?

358
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,116
Oh.

359
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,676
Right this way.

360
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,958
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

361
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,470
Game on.

362
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,717
Naughty, naughty,
Detective Espinoza.

363
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,954
Just making sure
the bills are real.

364
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,396
Only way to really tell
is to spend it, right?

365
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,750
That's right.

366
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,232
Aren't you tired
of skimming money?

367
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,314
Of arresting criminals

368
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,352
who, if they have
enough money,

369
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,115
to hire someone like me,
they always get away with it?

370
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,952
I know I'm tired of always
solving their problems.

371
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,234
Where are you going
with this?

372
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,034
What if I told you
there was a safe

373
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,875
with hundreds of thousands of
dollars just sitting in it,

374
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,233
and I know the
combination?

375
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,353
And why do you
need <i>my</i> help?

376
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,359
Well, the safe is in
the penthouse of Lux,

377
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,432
and the club is
currently a crime scene,

378
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,756
which means I need access.

379
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,753
Morningstar's place?
Why didn't you just lead with that?

380
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,192
I'd love to screw over
that douchebag.

381
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,711
Well... you get us
in the building,

382
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,237
I'll get us the money.

383
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,916
- Not gonna happen.
- What, you think

384
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,435
I'm just gonna take
the money and run?

385
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,915
Yep.

386
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,873
Look, the penthouse
has only one way in

387
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,110
and one way out.

388
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,796
I need you to
stand watch

389
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,992
to make sure nobody
comes in behind me.

390
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,591
Okay. Fine.

391
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,195
But I'll also be watching
to make sure

392
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,909
you don't sneak out
and disappear.

393
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,117
Because you'd
miss me if I did?

394
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,710
You know what?

395
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,110
Maybe I would.

396
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,396
Excuse me.

397
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,795
Hi. Detective Gennaro.

398
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,912
- I need to speak with Rex Wilson.
- sorry, Detective,

399
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,594
Rex is already
out there on the speedway

400
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,155
for his practice run.

401
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,993
Uh, all right. Thanks.

402
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,271
Yep.

403
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,800
- I don't know!
- Something's wrong!

404
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,278
What is it you're using
my talents for this time, Luci?

405
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,075
Another orgy you want prolonged?

406
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,355
Race cars!

407
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,757
Of course.

408
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,360
Yes, but it's not what it
looks like this time, Brother.

409
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,717
But thank you
for arriving so speedily.

410
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,636
Actually... come
to think of it,

411
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,751
you've been quite fast

412
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,599
at responding to my
summons recently.

413
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,156
I'm just eager to return you

414
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,392
back to where you belong,
Brother... in Hell.

415
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,757
Yes, but you never seem to be
in the middle of anything.

416
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,354
How is the Silver City?

417
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,239
Still Silver. Still a City.

418
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,477
And our siblings?
I hear Uriel's

419
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,592
gone and grown a mustache.

420
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,438
He did?

421
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,632
I wouldn't know.
I'm stuck down here.

422
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,557
But you should.

423
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,750
Well, it's been
a couple of years

424
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,990
since I've been back, Luci.

425
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,630
So where have you been?

426
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,673
Certainly not slumming it
with the humans.

427
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,354
Wait, have you been

428
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,789
flying around this whole time

429
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,838
like some sort
of feathery homeless man?

430
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,397
Wait, that <i>is</i>
what you've been doing.

431
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,835
What choice do I have?

432
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,754
Since you refuse
to return to Hell,

433
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,878
I can't possibly face
our siblings or...

434
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,877
Dad?

435
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,869
Yeah. Quite the judgmental one,

436
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,275
I'm well aware.

437
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,119
Well...

438
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,236
if your pride won't let you back
into the Silver City, Brother,

439
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,671
you should give humans a try.

440
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,400
Oh, come on, Luci,

441
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,080
I'm the foremost
of God's angels.

442
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,471
I can't just intermix
with these humans, like...

443
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,000
What, like me?

444
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,470
Yeah, don't
worry, Brother.

445
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,160
I mean, they are
absurd creatures,

446
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,840
but sometimes they surprise you.

447
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,032
You should try
talking to one.

448
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,635
See what happens.

449
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,440
Now, if you don't mind...

450
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,159
Time for a chat, Rexie.

451
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,834
What the hell happened?
How did you...

452
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,992
Focus! I need
you to tell me,

453
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,431
- why did you kill Stryder Nov...
- Let him go!

454
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,956
- Huh?
- How the hell did you make it out here anyway?

455
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,351
Look, just give me a moment,
and I'll be out of your...

456
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,391
Look, just move.

457
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,036
You're not going anywhere, pal.

458
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,720
Look, I just want to talk...

459
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,960
I thought you
just wanted to talk.

460
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,556
Why are you arresting me?
Did you see what that nutjob did?

461
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,434
How the hell
did he do that, anyway?

462
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,440
I don't care about him.

463
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,956
I want to know about
the murder of Stryder Novac.

464
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,595
Stryder... Oh, man. I was
trying not to think about that

465
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,075
- and just focus on the race...
- I know he was

466
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,875
gonna replace you and force you
into an early retirement,

467
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,312
so you can knock it off
with the weepy act!

468
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,636
I didn't kill him,
if that's what you're thinking.

469
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,990
I would never do that.

470
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,754
All right, we can do this
one of three ways.

471
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,111
the easy way or...

472
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,754
What the hell!

473
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,198
There is no easy way.
We can do this the fast way,

474
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,629
the slow way...

475
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,476
Then, there's my <i>favorite</i> way!

476
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,878
So, try, maybe, 'cause
there is nothing I love more

477
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,753
than making a grown man cry.

478
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,394
I-I'll tell you everything
you want to know.

479
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,120
So that's your
favorite way.

480
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,710
I've always wondered
since I saw you give

481
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,480
<i>Thou Shalt Not Kill.</i>

482
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,796
I thought that sounded
familiar. What...

483
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,271
Wait a minute,

484
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,996
are you Chloe Decker?

485
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,634
She is.
Amazing, isn't it?

486
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,594
What the hell is
going on around here?

487
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,956
He was about to talk.

488
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,753
Well, apologies
for the interruption.

489
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,155
But if you'll allow me
to make amends,

490
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,555
I've got a few skills
of my own.

491
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,480
Tell me... Rex...

492
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,759
what is it you desire?

493
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,551
Wait, I...

494
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,918
want a good story.

495
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,349
- Wh-What...
- What are you talking about?

496
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,236
Uh, people, they don't
follow cars anymore.

497
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,911
They follow drivers.

498
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,079
Drama. Stryder's dad,
he was a NASCAR legend.

499
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,511
And your biggest rival,
if I remember correctly.

500
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,632
When he died,
so did my merch sales.

501
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,069
So, getting Stryder
to replace him,

502
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,794
that-that-that got
the rivalry back.

503
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,872
Yeah, but how does that
help you? You're out of a job.

504
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,400
I started a management firm

505
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,795
about a year ago...
Stryder was a client.

506
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,918
It was my idea to
get him to replace me.

507
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,791
Poor kid. Stryder,
he... he was so happy

508
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,030
when I made him
that offer.

509
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,800
Well, yeah, it was an
opportunity of a lifetime.

510
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,952
Apparently, he needed the money
to get him out of a jam.

511
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,914
What do you mean, "jam"?

512
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,430
He was having some trouble
with a guy at work.

513
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,159
Uh, uh, excuse me.

514
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,629
What the hell
was that back there?

515
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,194
I've already apologized
for interrupting

516
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,595
your monologue,
Ms. Decker.

517
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,196
No, how the hell did you
get Rex to spill like that?

518
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,955
Ah, well, I have the ability
to draw out people's desires.

519
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,355
Well, what are you,
psychic or something?

520
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,791
No, no, I can't read
people's minds.

521
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,514
I'm not a Jedi.

522
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,439
People just like
to tell me things.

523
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,317
Okay, well, we should stop
stepping on each other's toes,

524
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,552
because we both clearly
want the same thing.

525
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,872
Oh, that's very forward
of you, Ms. Decker.

526
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,440
Yes, I will have sex with you.

527
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,552
- We should probably solve this murder first...
- No, no.

528
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,075
I mean that we should
work together.

529
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,432
No.

530
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,233
I mean, you've proven
a very impressive adversary,

531
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,199
but I'm not really
a "work together" kind of Devil.

532
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,880
- So...
- Well, too bad.

533
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,431
Because I know who Stryder was
fighting with at work.

534
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,076
Very well...

535
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,270
Lead the way, Ms. Decker.

536
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,636
So, the second marriage
is going well?

537
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,115
Oh, totally.

538
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,113
Uh, e-even though
I've made mistakes,

539
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,397
the second time around
just feels better. You know?

540
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,869
Mm, yes.

541
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,834
It can be hard
to trust again.

542
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,799
This time I just know
she loves me for me.

543
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,713
I have no doubt...

544
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,560
that you'll stay with us.

545
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,314
More with box office sensation
Nathan Fury when we come back.

546
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,440
And cut.

547
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,829
Wow, Linda, every day I am
in awe watching you work.

548
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,874
Oh...
Thank you, Stacy.

549
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,509
Uh, when we come
back from break,

550
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,632
ask him how he feels about
his new wife cheating on him.

551
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,072
Can you just give us one second,
please? Thank you.

552
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,270
Wait, what?

553
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,751
Our investigator
caught her on tape

554
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,600
kissing her costar
at the Farmer's Market.

555
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,557
Juicy, right?

556
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,831
No. My God,
that's terrible.

557
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,599
That's going to
devastate Nathan.

558
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,274
And make great TV.

559
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,635
As his therapist,
I can't in good conscience

560
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,394
incite a breakdown.

561
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,154
That's not why I do this.

562
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,431
And that is why America
loves you, Linda.

563
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,074
But you know what else
America loves?

564
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,231
Tears.

565
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,874
But Stacy, you can't...

566
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,116
Ratings are down.

567
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,917
We need a boost like this.

568
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,395
What's more important
to you?

569
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,877
set.

570
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,357
Aah!

571
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,279
That's who was arguing
with your stuntman?

572
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,392
- Lara Croft wannabe?
- What the hell, Rogers?

573
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,000
Erika Dunlap.
My costar.

574
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,720
I told you that move
wouldn't work.

575
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,276
Why don't you ever
listen to me?

576
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,437
Well, she seems to be fighting
with a lot of people.

577
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,711
Well, her beef with Stryder
was a lot bigger.

578
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,951
Oh?

579
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,316
Chloe, what
are you doing here?

580
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,351
You on the schedule today?

581
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,711
Hey, Ben. I just forgot
some things in my trailer.

582
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,679
But what's going on
with Erika lately?

583
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,110
I mean, she was giving
Stryder grief, too,

584
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,470
the last time I saw her.

585
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,279
Everyone deals with
death differently.

586
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,039
In Erika's case, she
deals by taking it out

587
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,913
- on my entire stunt team.
- Lovely.

588
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,720
Nothing we can't handle.

589
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,996
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

590
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,153
All right, when you're finished
having a catch-up...

591
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,672
- What?
- What was the bigger beef?

592
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,998
Uh, well, Erika got
hurt during a stunt

593
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,230
and she was looking forward

594
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,671
to a hefty settlement, but
her eyewitness, Stryder,

595
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,439
refused to testify on her behalf

596
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,718
and it-it didn't go over well
with Erika.

597
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,316
Oh, so you think she killed him
out of revenge?

598
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,273
Or knowing that without
an eyewitness,

599
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,960
she'd have a better chance
at winning the case.

600
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,514
And reap the windfall.

601
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,632
Right. You know,
I'd go talk to Erika,

602
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,236
but she and I don't
exactly see eye-to-eye.

603
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,718
I've seen what you
can do to people.

604
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,719
Erika's trailer
is right there.

605
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,197
Why don't you go
and, you know,

606
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,997
do your thing?

607
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,557
Ah.

608
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,920
- I mean...
- Monkey?

609
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,952
Dad. Hi. What-what
are you doing here?

610
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,919
Well, I've been hearing
some crazy stories.

611
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,233
You didn't sneak into
a NASCAR race, right?

612
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,669
And you definitely didn't
impersonate a cop?

613
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,234
Okay, Dad, it's not what
you're thinking.

614
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,590
Good, 'cause if
you're still working

615
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,713
with that mentally ill nightclub
owner, w-what's-his-name.

616
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,235
Lucifer!

617
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,760
- Lucifer!
- That's right,

618
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,520
say my name. Say my name.

619
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,037
<i>Lucifer?</i>

620
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,076
Is anyone here?

621
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,591
Lucifer?

622
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,673
Jackpot.

623
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,316
Um, I work for Lucifer.

624
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,434
He sent me here to
get the cash for...

625
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,074
I don't care
about the money.

626
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,277
You don't?

627
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,437
I care about why you want it.

628
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,754
Tell me the truth
and it's yours.

629
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,319
Lucifer needs it

630
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,000
to finish the
Vegas deal.

631
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,320
Because I deserve it.

632
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,149
What would you do with it?

633
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,680
Whatever I damn well want.

634
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,239
I'll take that
as a promise.

635
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,712
Go.

636
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,193
Embrace your deepest,
darkest desire.

637
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,277
Let those sinful little embers
burn into a flame.

638
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,598
Why?

639
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,117
We'll meet again...
eventually.

640
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,352
Somewhere hotter.

641
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,720
And the more you sin,

642
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,038
the more fun it'll be for me.

643
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,832
Think of this as foreplay.

644
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,756
However...

645
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,874
if I ever see you and that
boy toy in Los Angeles again,

646
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,393
I will gut that pretty
belly of yours.

647
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,199
Everyone knows you don't
steal from the Devil.

648
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,910
Do you have any idea

649
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,316
what a difficult situation
you've put me in?

650
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,710
Dad, I had to do something.

651
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,071
Okay? Stryder wasn't killed
in a bar fight.

652
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,789
And we are on to something.
I can feel it.

653
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,798
- "We"?
- Bye, Erika.

654
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,957
My flexible friend.

655
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,629
Well, your plan worked wonders.

656
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,594
Consider the suspect
well and truly pumped.

657
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,757
F-F-For information.

658
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,917
Uh-huh. He means pumped
for information.

659
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,550
What happened to doing
your hypno-eye thing?

660
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,670
- With the eyes.
- Oh.

661
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,678
- That's what you meant.
- Yes.

662
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,314
Oh, no, we went at it
like little bunnies.

663
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,113
Next time you should be
more specific.

664
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,718
There will be no "next time."

665
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,800
I raised you better
than this, Chloe.

666
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,518
- Dad...
- Oh.

667
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,717
Papa Decker, I presume?

668
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,032
Right. Well,
from what I've seen,

669
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,232
what you've raised is
an intelligent, capable

670
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,035
and frustratingly
stubborn woman.

671
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,833
Don't talk to me
about my daughter.

672
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,679
We'll discuss this later.

673
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,554
Now go home.

674
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,478
I...

675
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,670
Charming.

676
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,720
I don't know why, but I actually
thought he'd be proud of me.

677
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,560
Well, disappointing fathers is
a rite of passage, Ms. Decker.

678
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,274
Take it from someone
who's made a living out of it.

679
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,800
No, no, he's right.

680
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,190
He's right. I'm not a cop.

681
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,030
I'm an actress.

682
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,995
I mean... who really thought
that I could solve a murder?

683
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,357
Well, I did.

684
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,754
And I still do.

685
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,236
There's no evidence,
not of anything.

686
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,874
That's not necessarily true,

687
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,639
'cause I just learned that
that Erika woman

688
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,194
can put her ankles
around my neck.

689
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,597
Okay, that's really
not helping right now.

690
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,756
Thank you.

691
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,070
Wait, if she was
really injured,

692
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,430
she wouldn't be
able to do that.

693
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,990
Precisely.
She was faking her injury.

694
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,317
And she was very
generous with information

695
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,590
after I was very generous
with the ol...

696
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,075
Okay, I don't want to know.

697
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,279
Okay. Well, she said
that she needed money

698
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,154
and that Stryder refused
to lie on her behalf.

699
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,476
But then he said he was coming
into a windfall

700
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,631
and could help her out.

701
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,672
Apparently he and a partner
were planning on stealing

702
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,394
something very valuable
from set.

703
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,472
So maybe Stryder was
backing out of this heist

704
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,636
to have a shot at NASCAR.

705
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,109
Well, his partner
wouldn't take kindly

706
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,834
to being left high and dry, now,
would he?

707
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,356
No. He wouldn't.

708
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,359
So, does that mean
you're still in, Detective?

709
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,754
How do we figure out who Stryder
was working with on set?

710
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,994
Perhaps the murder weapon
will help narrow it down.

711
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,636
Come on.

712
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,711
Okay.

713
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,710
Ah! Ms. Lopez.

714
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,357
Any joy tracing the mark
on that murder weapon?

715
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,911
Sort of, yeah, but not really.

716
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,800
This idiot upgraded
this poor girl's engine.

717
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,160
Amateurs, am I right?

718
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,794
This is who you gave
the murder weapon to?

719
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,150
You brought someone

720
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,396
in here with you?

721
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,354
Without asking?

722
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,280
What did I tell you about...

723
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,436
Oh, my God.

724
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,277
It's you.

725
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,030
Bonnie Gennaro?
I mean,

726
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,597
I-I know you're not <i>her</i> her,
but-but you're her.

727
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,870
I had no idea you were a fan.

728
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,150
My God, are-are you kidding?

729
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,029
Ever since I saw her

730
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,119
shimmy that 1970
Oldsmobile 442's lock

731
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,510
and speed off in
<i>The Weaponizer,</i>

732
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,117
she has been my inspiration.

733
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,396
Wait, wait.

734
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,398
I inspired you
to steal cars?

735
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,517
Living fast and free,
just like Bonnie.

736
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,677
- Just like Bonnie.
- I mean, I was thinking

737
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,837
of taking a very different
career path,

738
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,073
but the way
you brought Bonnie to life,

739
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,351
it-it really spoke to me.

740
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,320
Thank you, but you do know
by the end of the movie,

741
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,637
Bonnie did join
the police force.

742
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,710
Huh, well, no, I never really
watched it to the end.

743
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,957
Tell me.

744
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,640
What did you find on the murder
weapon, or didn't find?

745
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,991
Well, I'm so glad you asked.

746
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,309
Follow me, please.

747
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,871
It did have something
filed off of the handle.

748
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,359
But as far as I can tell, it
doesn't really mean anything.

749
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,517
I mean, "Last Lappers"?

750
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,756
Not exactly

751
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,314
a smoking gun.

752
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,034
Wait, I've heard that
somewhere before.

753
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,760
Well, that's the
name of the racing team

754
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,440
in the seminal '80s movie
<i>Razor's Edge.</i>

755
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,710
Kip Strong's struggle
between the love

756
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,149
of a woman and love of a race.

757
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,111
Fantastic movie, with some ve...

758
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,437
Wait, more importantly,
our stunt coordinator,

759
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,355
Rogers, he always bragged
about working on that.

760
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,519
So if Stryder and Rogers were
stealing something together,

761
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,477
and Stryder backed out...

762
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,554
Maybe Rogers killed Stryder
to tie up loose ends.

763
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,995
- Let's go talk to him.
- Right.

764
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,430
I'll drive.

765
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,316
Thank you, Ms. Lopez.

766
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,636
So great meeting you!

767
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,072
- Sir. Excuse me.
- I can't stop.

768
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,555
Do you know where
we can find Ben Rogers?

769
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,911
Very helpful,
thank you.

770
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,995
Well, look, even if we find him,

771
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,270
how do you plan on
confronting him?

772
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,954
It's not like we have proof
of his theft.

773
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,554
Unless we wait
and catch him in the act.

774
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,276
Okay, so what are the most
valuable items on set?

775
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,636
Uh, well, camera equipment

776
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,160
is worth a ton, uh,

777
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,750
wardrobe has a huge
resale value.

778
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,792
What about
a six-million-dollar car?

779
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,832
What? That's specific.
What makes you say that?

780
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,190
Seeing it drive off.

781
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,473
- Right.
- I got this.

782
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,236
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm trained for this.

783
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,397
What do you think
you're doing, Decker?

784
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,711
Confronting a murderer.

785
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,274
We know you killed Stryder, Ben.

786
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,477
And all because
he wouldn't

787
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,870
steal one little car.

788
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,400
I mean, it is lovely, but...

789
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,760
What? I'm not
stealing the car,

790
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,792
I'm getting it ready
for your stunt tomorrow, Decker.

791
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,429
You know, to keep you safe?

792
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,472
So you're welcome.

793
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,434
We found your prints
all over that murder weapon.

794
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,955
- You did?
- We did?

795
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,470
We didn't, but now I know

796
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,397
you killed him.

797
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,875
Ah.

798
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,839
Nice bit of improvisation
there, Ms. Decker.

799
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,275
I don't care what
the critics say.

800
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,800
You do have range.

801
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,679
Let's split up.
We can't let him get away.

802
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,070
There's nowhere to hide.

803
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,159
Oh, ho, ho.

804
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,959
Hello, murderer.

805
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,034
I didn't want this,
I didn't want any of this.

806
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,191
Well, then, perhaps,
you shouldn't have

807
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,635
killed an innocent man.

808
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,554
Stryder's the one
who backed out of the deal.

809
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,191
I begged him not to.

810
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,231
He forced my hand.

811
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,394
Just like you, right now.

812
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,518
Now, someone is buying me
a new shirt.

813
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,831
What the hell?

814
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,554
Now you're catching on.

815
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,512
Nice takedown, partner.

816
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,273
I heard gunshots, I was worried.

817
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,031
Lucky for you, Rogers
must've grabbed a prop gun.

818
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,310
Lucky for me.

819
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,636
Mm-hmm.

820
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,117
...never rendered
anyone unconscious before.

821
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,879
I mean, in real life.

822
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,190
Thank God
you're all right.

823
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,390
Dad.

824
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,070
- Hey.
- Hi.

825
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,116
Confronting a murderer?

826
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,390
What were you
thinking,

827
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,080
- being so...
- Foolish?

828
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,555
Rash? Reckless?

829
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,234
I've heard this tirade before.

830
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,999
Well, let me educate you, sir.

831
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,360
You underestimate your daughter.

832
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,232
She is...

833
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,510
Brave.

834
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,354
I was gonna say "brave."

835
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,071
Right.

836
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,835
I...

837
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,880
I know I've made
mistakes, Chlo.

838
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,316
Lots of them.

839
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,350
But honey, I've never

840
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,040
underestimated you.

841
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,639
Then how come any time

842
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,798
I've ever shown
any interest in your job,

843
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,391
you-you either change the
subject, or you push me away?

844
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,080
Because you're way
smarter than me,

845
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,157
you're more headstrong
than your mother

846
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,229
and it scared me.

847
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,233
I mean, what if you
wanted to become a cop?

848
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,430
What if I did?

849
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,155
Oh, Monkey.

850
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,116
I've been shot at, beat up,

851
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,070
chased by a naked guy
with a harpoon, once.

852
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,431
And...

853
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,510
none of those things
scare me as much

854
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,838
as thinking of you
in those situations.

855
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,154
It was never about whether
you could handle it.

856
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,360
It was whether I could.

857
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,555
And I'm sorry.

858
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,039
But a parent just wants
what's best for their child.

859
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,276
It's okay.

860
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,115
I love you so much.

861
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,913
I love you, too, Monkey.

862
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,074
So, I, uh, got a crime scene
to clean up now, thanks to you.

863
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,995
Perhaps our dads aren't
so similar after all.

864
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,676
Ah, well, my dad
surprised me.

865
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,750
Maybe yours will, too.

866
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,792
I'm not holding my breath.

867
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,753
<i>Choice is a funny thing.</i>

868
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:05,238
<i>Give someone different options,
different circumstances,</i>

869
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,830
<i>will they themselves
end up different?</i>

870
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,800
<i>Sure, they might end up
with a different job,</i>

871
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,276
<i>find inspiration
from different people.</i>

872
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,598
<i>But will thez still be
the same person at their core?</i>

873
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,834
<i>Some might continue down
a darker path,</i>

874
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,872
<i>never knowing
there was a different way.</i>

875
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,120
<i>The potential buried deep down,
but still there.</i>

876
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,269
<i>Some make immoral choices
instead of moral ones.</i>

877
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,030
<i>But they'll still
have the same conscience.</i>

878
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,196
<i>The question is,</i>

879
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,915
<i>will they ever make the choice
to listen to it?</i>

880
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,872
<i>And sometimes, it isn't the
right moment in someone's life</i>

881
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,673
<i>to make a certain choice.</i>

882
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,796
<i>And no matter
how badly zou want</i>

883
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,595
<i>to nudge them
in the right direction...</i>

884
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,715
<i>...you know they need
to find it on their own.</i>

885
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,917
<i>And some people find love
in the strangest of situations,</i>

886
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,872
<i>and are, somehow,
happier for it.</i>

887
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,230
Well, that was quite
fun, wasn't it?

888
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,031
Hmm?

889
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,199
Not bad for a half-in-the-bag
club owner and an actress.

890
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,955
Well, I...

891
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,751
I don't know if "fun"
is the word I would use.

892
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,189
No?

893
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,958
Yeah, but it certainly
was fulfilling.

894
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,520
You know, it makes me think

895
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,280
maybe I'm tired

896
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,518
of playing a cop
in the movies, you know?

897
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,676
Maybe...

898
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,710
Maybe I'd like
to play detective for real.

899
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,753
What?

900
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,237
Hang up the glitz
and the glamour for a badge

901
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,750
and a naked man
with a harpoon?

902
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,398
Yeah.

903
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,630
Oh.

904
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,270
Maybe I'll tag along.

905
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,880
It's never gonna happen.

906
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,629
Care to wager?

907
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,317
<i>And some,
no matter how you shake things up,</i>

908
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,275
<i>end up making the same choices,
are drawn to the same people,</i>

909
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,994
<i>the same passions.</i>

910
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,359
<i>So all seems
to have ended well.</i>

911
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,710
<i>Does that mean
I never should've</i>

912
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,479
<i>manipulated things
to begin with?</i>

913
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,913
<i>I have a better question.</i>

914
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,874
<i>Wouldn't you do the same
in my shoes?</i>

915
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:56,040
<i>After all, a parent just wants
what's best for their child.</i>
