1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,432
<i>- Previously on</i> Lucifer...
- Cain is alive.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,517
You know, for an immortal,

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,836
you really do bleed a lot,
don't you?

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,350
<i>I still feel all the
pain that comes with death,</i>

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,630
<i>just the wounds heal.</i>

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,559
<i>I am a soldier of God.</i>

7
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,671
His favorite son.

8
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,200
Oh, that's gonna be a thing,
isn't it?

9
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,039
It was weird

10
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,511
seeing you and Amenadiel
so chummy.

11
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,393
<i>It makes me feel left out.</i>

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,273
I'm missing time.

13
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,120
<i>It's like someone else
was living my life.</i>

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,880
I've been pretending
like I remember it all

15
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,436
<i>because otherwise, everyone
would think that I'm crazy.</i>

16
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,154
My Dad screwed us both.

17
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,829
But perhaps there's a way
for us to screw Him back.

18
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,030
<i>If we're gonna kill you,</i>

19
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,118
we have got to do it together.

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,591
What do you got for me?

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,117
I said no phone.

22
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:11,958
Sorry.

23
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,991
Thought I turned it off.

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,270
It's just my sister.

25
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,709
The cops are calling you?

26
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,156
Your sister's a cop?

27
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,510
She works in forensics.

28
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,796
Trust me, okay?
Just...

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,557
put the gun down.

30
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,913
Come on, Jay, I'm your sister.

31
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,952
I'm not supposed to have to
leave a message after the beep,

32
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,594
you're supposed to call me back.

33
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,160
Take off your shirt.

34
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,639
Don't flatter yourself.

35
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,839
In my quest to help you die,
I've done some research,

36
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,799
and I think the key
may lie in understanding

37
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,474
the mark
that my Father placed on you.

38
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,273
Oh, that's a waste of time.
I've already tried

39
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,630
to figure out what it means.

40
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,837
I've read every book, I've
analyzed every language.

41
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,032
Well, have you ever let
the Devil take a gander?

42
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,270
Didn't think so.

43
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,634
Okay.

44
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,351
Well, where's the rest of it?
The tattoo on top.

45
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,750
The skull and the spears.

46
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,360
Well, my body's
constantly healing.

47
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,557
I have to reapply the tattoo
every few months.

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,400
Well, why bother at all?

49
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,394
Because it represents
my immortality, my curse.

50
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,920
- I hate it.
- Yes, yes.

51
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,474
You hate living forever
'cause you can't see

52
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,397
how much fun it is.

53
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,000
I'll never understand you.

54
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,871
What?

55
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,310
Do you have something?

56
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,551
- Seriously?
- Well, it's worth a try.

57
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,433
God, this was much easier
in <i>The DVC.</i>

58
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,391
<i>DVC?</i>

59
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,796
My research text.
Also a movie.

60
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,830
By the way, Tom Hanks
is a national treasure.

61
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,759
Also a movie.
Not as helpful, though.

62
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,270
Your research was watching
<i>The Da Vinci Code?</i>

63
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,312
- And the sequels.
- No offense, Lucifer,

64
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,552
but I don't think
this is in your wheelhouse.

65
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,077
You're right.

66
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,555
Amenadiel's the brainy one.

67
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,955
We should ask him.

68
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,989
That's a good idea.
You think he'll help?

69
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,919
Well, we've grown
much closer, he and I.

70
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,637
I'll convince him.

71
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,273
En garde!

72
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,917
Oh, no!
No, no, no, please. Please,

73
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,554
don't harm me,
fierce warrior.

74
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,114
I-I-I surrender!

75
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,914
I will spare your life.

76
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,796
This time.

77
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,032
We're wearing the same shirt!

78
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,275
- Sushi shirt!
- Sushi shirt!

79
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,757
Come on in.

80
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,996
I don't know
what's going on out there,

81
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,350
but I hate it!

82
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,271
Oh.

83
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,637
Hey, Ellen.

84
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,240
It's Ella.

85
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,317
Decker's not here.

86
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,877
I'm, um, actually looking
for you.

87
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,111
Trix,

88
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,750
sever
their Achilles first.

89
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,590
If they can't walk,

90
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,916
- they can't betray you.
- They can't betray you.

91
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,917
Got it.

92
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,871
Okay.

93
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,596
What's up?

94
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,556
Um, well, my brother
came into town yesterday,

95
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,280
and I can't

96
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,630
get ahold of him.

97
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,271
Good talk. See you later.

98
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,159
No, wait. I-It's not like him

99
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,635
to just disappear.

100
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,479
I can't find him.

101
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,598
Anywhere.

102
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,120
And everyone says

103
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,317
that you are the best
bounty hunter we've got.

104
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,360
Ah, so he's a criminal.

105
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,960
No. No, no, no, no.

106
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,760
But... I got a bad feeling.

107
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,754
Please, I need
your help.

108
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,877
I'll pay!

109
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,590
Next time, lead with that.

110
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,669
So, does that mean
you'll help me?

111
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,552
<i>No.</i>

112
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,076
What do you mean, no?

113
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,237
God cursed Cain because
he killed his own brother.

114
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,556
And you want to
remove that curse,

115
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,192
which God placed on him
for a very good reason.

116
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,037
Does that even sound

117
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,879
like something
that I would help you do?

118
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,800
Well, it did,
until you put it like that.

119
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,270
Look, this is important to me,
Amenadiel.

120
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,437
I need your help.

121
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,074
Just take a look
at the mark, and maybe

122
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,800
it'll jog something
in that geeky brain of yours.

123
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,832
If Father wanted you
to understand Cain's mark,

124
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,757
He simply would've...

125
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,280
Send my angelic brother down
to help me?

126
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,511
Nice try.

127
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,160
We've been through a lot,
you and I.

128
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,000
I thought we were getting along.

129
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,077
I thought we were...

130
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,319
well, brothers, for once.

131
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,351
We are, Luci.

132
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,994
But you're also my test.

133
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,473
The reason Father has placed me
here on Earth without my powers.

134
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,315
So I need to protect you from yourself.

135
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,836
I gave my word, Brother.

136
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,599
That's not my problem.

137
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,911
<i>My sources say your brother</i>

138
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,520
<i>had a meeting here last night.</i>

139
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,837
- Really?
- This place belongs to a diamond dealer.

140
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,076
Fahrid Nasser.

141
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,039
Never heard of him.
But my brother

142
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,351
is a diamond authenticator. I
mean, makes sense he'd be here.

143
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,791
Well,
apparently, this Fahrid guy,

144
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,791
real sketchy dude.

145
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,997
Okay, my brother is
literally the one

146
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,793
who determines
if diamonds are legit.

147
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,271
Okay? That's the polar
opposite of sketchy.

148
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,279
So if he was here,
he had his reasons.

149
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,557
No.

150
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,194
No, no, no. No.

151
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,917
Thank God.

152
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,559
I mean, too bad for
this dude, but...

153
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,550
thank you, Big Guy.

154
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,070
Yeah. Huge relief.

155
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,796
Your brother's not dead.

156
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,639
Instead, he might be
the killer.

157
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,717
Can't believe you
called the cops.

158
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,475
Maze, for the last time,

159
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,712
stop telling people
not to call the cops.

160
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,354
And why wouldn't
I call this in, okay?

161
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,317
Even if Jay

162
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,914
was here, he's innocent.

163
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,277
Which means he might have seen
who did this.

164
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,634
Wait, he might be in danger.

165
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,115
Is this the brother
who steals cars?

166
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,555
Oh, no, Jay's the oldest.

167
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,831
- And you know how older brothers are.
- Yeah.

168
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,953
- Oh. I'm an only child.
- Oh.

169
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,753
Well, Jay is the good one.

170
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,235
The one we all looked up to.

171
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,718
I mean, I know
my family's got its issues,

172
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,593
but not Jay.

173
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,553
I mean,
he really made me believe

174
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,796
I could live a good life.

175
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,475
Mm, well, that's what eldest
brothers want you to think.

176
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,030
Always talking down to you

177
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,833
from their pedestals
that they put themselves on.

178
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,636
But when you need them
to help you kill someone...

179
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,156
where
are they then, hmm?

180
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,153
We still don't know
for sure, guys,

181
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,635
if he was even here.

182
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,115
- He was here.
- Maze,

183
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,198
I know you've got
your sources or whatever.

184
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,760
But I'm just saying,
until fingerprint

185
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,155
and DNA analysis
comes back,

186
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,959
- we don't know...
- I found his wallet.

187
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,030
Maze, where did you get that?

188
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,877
It was in the corner over there

189
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,355
when we first
walked in.

190
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,229
What? He's still my bounty,

191
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,351
and I haven't
found him.

192
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,957
"Jay Lopez."

193
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,911
It's your brother.

194
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,879
Which means
he's definitely...

195
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,634
Not the killer!

196
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,518
Based on the blood spatter,
the bullet was fired

197
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,631
from this angle, right?

198
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,991
It looks that way.

199
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,237
But this looks
like powder burn, okay?

200
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,353
So the only way to shoot
from this angle further back

201
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,756
would be if you were a lefty.

202
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,758
And... drumroll,
please... my brother

203
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,871
is a righty.

204
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,356
So, obviously, there must have
been another person here.

205
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,193
Uh, okay. Okay.

206
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,552
Well, we'll start looking
for this left-handed shooter.

207
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,560
But, in the meantime,

208
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,638
I really think it's
best for everybody

209
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,275
and-and your brother

210
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,393
if you just step away
from the investigation.

211
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,156
Okay, yeah. I-I get it.

212
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,840
But I'm gonna go
and try to find Jay.

213
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,315
I really would prefer you don't.

214
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,590
He could be in danger.

215
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,512
Okay, I'll call you

216
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,790
if we find anything.

217
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,270
Great. Now that we're done
with that charade,

218
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,119
shall we track down
Ms. Lopez's murderous brother

219
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,197
before she does?

220
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,875
I trust Ella's instincts.

221
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,400
It does seem like there was
another person here.

222
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,636
So, just to be safe,

223
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,996
let's pursue
both scenarios.

224
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,510
Brothers can't be trusted,
Detective.

225
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,960
You're just delaying
her inevitable disappointment.

226
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,472
Maybe.

227
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,434
Maybe not.

228
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,197
I've been through some...

229
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,959
trauma.

230
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,112
And I've been avoiding it.

231
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,676
But, recently, um,
events have caused me to realize

232
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,836
that I need to...

233
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,791
face my fears.

234
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,516
Lucifer mentioned that
you worked wonders with him.

235
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,918
I mean, you see someone
who calls himself the Devil.

236
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,510
So anything I say can't sound
too crazy, right?

237
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,114
I haven't been
to therapy before.

238
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,912
Is this where I start...

239
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,749
telling you
what I'm going through?

240
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,757
Um...

241
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,597
a couple of months ago,

242
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,237
I had a near-death experience.

243
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:57,197
And I think that-that
when I was dead, um,

244
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,349
I think that I was in Hell,

245
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,431
reliving the same nightmare...

246
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,960
I can't help you.

247
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,557
Excuse me?

248
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,273
You need to leave.

249
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,717
Now.

250
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,431
Oh, I'm...

251
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,470
Of course. I'm s...

252
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,637
I'm so sorry to have...

253
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,310
to have wasted your time.

254
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,755
I really am beyond help,
aren't I?

255
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,510
Brothers.

256
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,631
Am I right?

257
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,990
I mean, you get it.
You killed yours.

258
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,390
I wish I had that option.

259
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,040
Amenadiel won't
help, I take it?

260
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,555
Nope.

261
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,399
No. I mean,
I shouldn't be surprised.

262
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,034
Ever since he found out
he's Dad's favorite,

263
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,151
he's been a bit of a dick.

264
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,272
- What do you mean?
- Well, lots of chest puffing

265
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,596
and peacocking.

266
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,599
I mean, even more than usual,
with that insufferably smug...

267
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,679
No, I mean, how do you know
that he's God's favorite?

268
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,031
It's a long story,
involving a flaming sword

269
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,356
and a space vagina.

270
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,755
But the quick version:

271
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,480
a book said it,
so it must be true.

272
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,913
Anyway, not to worry.

273
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,993
I'll find a way
to bring him round.

274
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,830
Our victim's Fahrid Nasser...
he's an international diamond salesman.

275
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,793
So it makes sense that
you'd find a loose diamond

276
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,912
in his office, but can you skip
to the part where you help us

277
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,077
track down Ms. Lopez's
disappointment of a brother?

278
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,913
I thought we were looking
for another suspect.

279
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,079
We are. Despite
Lucifer's attempt

280
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,670
to make this case about what's
going on with his own brother.

281
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,439
- You were saying, Dan?
- Well,

282
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,071
it would make sense to find
a diamond in a broker's office,

283
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,192
unless that diamond
was reported stolen.

284
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,118
Fortunately for us,

285
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,834
diamonds are
pretty easy to track.

286
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,236
Each one of them has
a serial number

287
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,760
laser-etched into it.

288
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,000
I usually get them to add crude
drawings to the back of mine.

289
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,393
- Where was it stolen from?
- A diamond boutique

290
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,198
in Beverly Hills.

291
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,357
Here's the kicker...
Fahrid, our victim,

292
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,273
- he's one of the store's diamond brokers.
- So, what,

293
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,113
he sells to them,
uses that as a cover

294
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,993
- to the case the joint, then robs it?
- Maybe.

295
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,475
File on the robbery's
pretty thin...

296
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,990
no security cameras,
no witnesses,

297
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,429
- not a lot to go on.
- All right,

298
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,359
well, maybe Fahrid
had an accomplice?

299
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,756
That could be our
other suspect.

300
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,958
Let's go to the jewelry store,
see if we can drum up

301
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,556
any new leads now that we
know Fahrid is involved.

302
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,873
Ah, the diamond industry...

303
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,753
truly the greatest trick
someone other than me

304
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,916
played on the world.

305
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,157
Thousands of dollars
for lumps of old coal.

306
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,510
Incredible.

307
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,030
Ah. Hello there.
We're here to...

308
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,560
We're here to...

309
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,037
to get a ring.

310
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,959
We are?

311
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,597
Yes. Yeah, he was
gonna surprise me.

312
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,120
But I knew what
he was up to.

313
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,511
- - We're engaged.
- Oh.

314
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,437
How nice.

315
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,356
Mm.

316
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,075
Sweetie, I-I don't know
if we came to the right place.

317
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,237
I expect a, a <i>much...</i>

318
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,672
higher clarity,
and-and the color here is <i>blech.</i>

319
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,151
Oh, I see you have
quite a discerning eye.

320
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,511
I have some
other wonderful options.

321
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,513
- Just a moment.
- Thank you.

322
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,236
I... am confused.

323
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,030
The file said that there was
no security footage.

324
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,800
All these cameras,
they're not new, which means

325
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,832
they were here at the time
of the robbery, which means

326
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,679
this was probably
an inside job.

327
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,600
Yeah, I got that part... flush out
the accomplice, et cetera, et cetera.

328
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,156
No, how do you know
so much about diamonds?

329
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,158
Well, I've watched
enough <i>Real Housewives</i>

330
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,589
to fake it with
the best of them.

331
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,753
Oh. Wonderful.

332
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,517
Really?

333
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,000
No. No.

334
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,395
These still
won't do.

335
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,069
How about this... why don't
I show you what I don't want?

336
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,120
This is what he got me
for Valentine's Day.

337
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,238
I didn't know that
my future husband

338
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,760
was that cheap.

339
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,879
I am not cheap.

340
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,232
That diamond is
of the highest quality.

341
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,638
Is it? Is it of the
highest quality?

342
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,830
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's see.

343
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,235
Oh.

344
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,949
Uh-huh, excellent color, and...

345
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,031
And what?

346
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,597
Uh, I'm sorry, uh...

347
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,519
I recognize
the serial number.

348
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,076
But, uh, this diamond is...

349
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,712
stolen.

350
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,189
- No.
- Stolen?

351
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,072
Can't be.

352
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,600
Stolen?!

353
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,075
You cheap son of a bitch.

354
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,600
I... For the last time,
I am not cheap.

355
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,036
- I'm gonna have to call the police.
- Oh, yes,

356
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,515
please, <i>please</i>

357
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,114
call the cops.

358
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,111
I want my future
ex-husband arrested

359
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,119
- for being cheap.
- R-Right. For the final time, d-darling...

360
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,080
No need to get
the authorities involved.

361
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,237
I'm Tiffany James,
the owner.

362
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,914
Why don't you come with me,

363
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,715
and we'll find you
the perfect diamond.

364
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,589
So, tell me exactly
what it is you're looking for.

365
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,509
It's funny,
Ms. James,

366
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,189
I was waiting for a clerk
to make a run for it,

367
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,551
or a security guard
to start sweating.

368
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,554
But the owner
of the store...

369
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,671
Excuse me?

370
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,195
Why rob your own store?

371
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,717
I don't know what
you're talking about.

372
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,118
- I'm LAPD.
- And I'm <i>not</i> cheap, for the record.

373
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,232
But let's cut to the chase,
shall we, Tiffany?

374
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,114
How did you help Jay Lopez
steal diamonds

375
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,390
and murder Fahrid Nasser?

376
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,711
Who's Jay Lopez? Wait.

377
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,791
Fahrid's dead?

378
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,434
Stop prompting the witness.

379
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,950
Fine. But the sooner we prove
Ms. Lopez's elder brother

380
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,595
is a liar and a disappointment,
the better.

381
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,031
Would you excuse us
for a second?

382
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,794
Thank you.

383
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,355
It's obvious that
you're having

384
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,119
some kind of fight
with Amenadiel,

385
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,119
but right now you need
to focus on the case.

386
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,915
- Fine.
- And for the record...

387
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,599
I wish I had a brother
to fight with.

388
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,110
But...

389
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,232
So, you admit to
knowing Fahrid.

390
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,472
Of course...
he sold diamonds here.

391
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,473
Wow, I can't believe
he's really dead.

392
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,280
Oh, a complete shock to you and
all your associates, I'm sure.

393
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,834
So let's get on with it,
shall we?

394
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,991
Tell me...

395
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,837
Tiffany,

396
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,040
what is it you desire?

397
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,151
To punch every millennial
in the face.

398
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,599
Really?

399
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,597
I mean, I
don't disagree,

400
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,836
but still.

401
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,152
They've ruined
our entire industry.

402
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,194
With their social consciousness
and ethical issues.

403
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,959
Sales are way down
because of them.

404
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,591
- Do you know how hard it is to stay afloat?
- so hard

405
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,235
- that you have to rob your own store?
- No one was supposed

406
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,556
to get hurt.

407
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,800
We just wanted
the insurance money.

408
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,595
This was
an insurance scam?

409
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,957
- Then why kill Fahrid?
- I didn't.

410
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,197
Fahrid was supposed to sell
the diamonds back to us

411
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,834
after he cleaned them, but...

412
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,110
now...

413
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,951
Well, I mean,
if anyone is cheap...

414
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,991
it's her.

415
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,433
Oh, why are we here?

416
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,871
Jay would never, ever stay
in a place like this.

417
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,554
Two days ago, he
used his debit card

418
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,399
at a gas station
around the corner.

419
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,240
So? Dude wanted a Slurpee...
it doesn't mean anything.

420
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,430
You don't come into
this neighborhood

421
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,199
unless you have a reason...
and if you're here

422
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,995
to do criminal activity, you
come to a hotel that takes cash.

423
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,953
- He is not a criminal.
- Yeah.

424
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,034
You've... never seen

425
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,754
this guy, right?

426
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,319
Have you seen him?

427
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,355
Unless you got a warrant,

428
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,234
I ain't answering
either of you.

429
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,110
Aah! Aah!

430
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,833
I'm gonna give you two choices.

431
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,156
I can either
break your arm...

432
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,117
...or I can cut your...

433
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,680
Maze! Just...

434
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,229
Do you have

435
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,556
a brother, sister,

436
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,350
anyone who you care about,
who it would just kill you

437
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,711
if you didn't know where they were,
if they were safe?

438
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,834
Threatening his family?

439
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,316
Hard-core, Ellen.

440
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,077
Ten bucks an hour
ain't worth this.

441
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,679
No Jay here. See?

442
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,670
Oh, no.

443
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,276
Michael Knight.

444
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,517
Who's that?

445
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,470
<i>Knight Rider.</i>

446
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,239
Jay's favorite show.

447
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,711
Doctor.

448
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,116
I got your text.
What's wrong?

449
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,436
Charlotte Richards.

450
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,278
What about her?

451
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,393
She came to see me...
as a client.

452
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,351
Oh, good, good.

453
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,630
She took my advice.

454
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,280
Why would you
send her to me?

455
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,994
Because you're the best.

456
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,475
She tried to kill me.

457
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,040
When she stepped
into my office,

458
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,357
everything she did
came rushing back.

459
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,910
Doctor...

460
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,353
my mother is gone.

461
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,072
Charlotte Richards
has done nothing to you.

462
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,797
She's just an innocent woman
who needs help.

463
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,756
Here.

464
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,160
At least she
didn't try and kiss you.

465
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,391
Hey, Chloe.

466
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,998
This is Don Zeikel,
the insurance adjustor

467
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,395
that covers
Tiffany James's store.

468
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,955
I'm in your debt.

469
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,038
It's rare we actually catch
insurance fraud.

470
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,515
Makes me miss being a cop.

471
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,076
Bet you don't miss the sad amounts
on the pay stubs.

472
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,158
No. Better Scotch and stylish
clothes don't make up

473
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,192
for that rush you get
when you catch a bad guy.

474
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,472
Now that I've gone corporate,
I just pay out the claims.

475
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,712
- Why's that?
- Oh, it's practically an untraceable crime

476
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,990
if the thieves
got a cleaner.

477
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,112
- A cleaner?
- It's someone who can replace

478
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,073
the microscopic serial
numbers on the diamonds.

479
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,593
- Like a diamond authenticator.
- sure.

480
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,433
Why? You know of
an authenticator involved?

481
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,793
- Not yet.
- Well,

482
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,275
please keep me
in the loop.

483
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,511
Great. Thank you.

484
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,431
Why do I get the feeling that
our two-pronged investigation

485
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,551
just lost a prong?

486
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,876
We got to find
Ella's brother.

487
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,554
You got any siblings?

488
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,314
Thousands and thousands.

489
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,115
Yeah. It could
feel like that sometimes.

490
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,637
You close to
any of 'em?

491
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,479
My family
doesn't do "close."

492
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,160
We mostly tortured
each other.

493
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,760
Aw, man, us, too.

494
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,150
My brothers used
to put their knees

495
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,477
on my arms and dangle a
loogie right over my face.

496
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,200
- Sounds horrifying.
- But then,

497
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,113
if I was ever in trouble,

498
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,874
they always had my back.

499
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,756
No matter what.

500
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,590
This is it.

501
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,717
Whoa!

502
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,874
No need to go all kung fu
on this innocent door.

503
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,078
Well, aren't <i>you</i> full
of surprises.

504
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,509
Nice job, Ellen.

505
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,519
It's Ella.

506
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,950
Jay?

507
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,032
So I finally get to meet
the infamous Amenadiel.

508
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,069
Look, I know who you are,
and I know what you want.

509
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,999
But I can't help you.

510
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,835
- Sorry.
- Oh, come on,

511
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,549
- buddy, I just want to chat.
- Yeah? About what?

512
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,996
The weather.

513
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,350
Sports.

514
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,632
By chance, you have any
idea how annoying it is

515
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,274
to be an immortal
human being?

516
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,675
I can't say that I do.

517
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,200
Oh, well, let me
enlighten you.

518
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,790
You see, first you get to
watch everyone you love die,

519
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,270
over and over.

520
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,750
And that sucks.

521
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,629
And on top of that, it's boring.

522
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,919
I've been everywhere
there is to go.

523
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,993
Tried every kind of food.

524
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,350
Sex. Music.

525
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,799
Nothing surprises me anymore.

526
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,840
Have you tried <i>Game of Thrones?</i>

527
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,394
It's been a literal
Hell on Earth.

528
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,751
Well, the punishment
fits the crime, Pierce.

529
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,879
A little harsh
if you ask me.

530
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,793
My Father always
has His reasons.

531
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,150
Right.

532
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,311
I've always wondered

533
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,030
who your Father would assign
such an important task.

534
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,436
It must have been someone
He really trusted.

535
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,719
Maybe... His favorite son.

536
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,200
You marked me, didn't you?

537
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,876
Yeah. It was me.

538
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,999
- And you deserved it.
- I didn't come here

539
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,078
to argue right or wrong.
In fact,

540
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,590
I just need your help.

541
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,313
And, see, the good
news for me is,

542
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,594
this can actually hurt you now.

543
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,400
You put this mark on me.

544
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,273
Now you're gonna tell me
how to get rid of it.

545
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,670
I didn't kill anyone!

546
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,512
And what better way

547
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,712
to prove it than
by swinging a bat at us?

548
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,229
I thought you were
trying to kill me.

549
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,033
No, we're trying
to help you, Jay.

550
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,596
Your wallet was found
at the scene of a murder.

551
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,796
What the
hell's going on?

552
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,559
Fahrid, the dead guy?

553
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,757
- Yeah?
- He was a gem broker I worked with in L.A.

554
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,837
a few times in the past.

555
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,997
He hired me to authenticate
some diamonds.

556
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,714
<i>Stolen</i> diamonds.

557
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,673
If they were stolen,
I had no idea.

558
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,630
But now that I
think about it,

559
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,629
Fahrid was acting
kind of strange.

560
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,510
- Strange how?
- Jumpy. He must have made me jumpy, too, cause I had to pee.

561
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,473
I was in the bathroom
when it happened.

562
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,080
You know how I get
when I'm nervous.

563
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,439
When I was in there,
I heard arguing

564
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,080
and then gunshots.

565
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,273
After I came out, I saw
Fahrid. He was... dead.

566
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,960
I was freaked out,
so I bailed.

567
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,676
Hmm.

568
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,394
Ella!

569
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,876
I work for the cops, Jay!
I could've helped you.

570
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,190
- Why? Why did you...?
- I didn't want to worry you. stop!

571
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,153
Please, be civilized.

572
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,080
I know it looks bad, but
you got to believe me. I...

573
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,600
I didn't kill anyone.

574
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,475
Hey, Chloe.
What's up?

575
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,670
So we've had no luck

576
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,195
finding this supposed
other person.

577
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,112
We may need to

578
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,919
consider other scenarios.

579
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,719
Like that maybe Jay...

580
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,997
wasn't just a witness
to the murder.

581
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,194
Look, I know that this is tough,
but I think it's best

582
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,436
if we talk
to Jay first.

583
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,359
So, have you had any
luck finding him?

584
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,116
No. No luck.

585
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,677
Okay.

586
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,632
Okay. Well,

587
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,836
let us know if you do.

588
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,156
She's lying.

589
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,392
Who's lying?
Your stylist?

590
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,359
Ella. More and more,
it looks like

591
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,114
her brother Jay
might be our shooter.

592
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,397
And because she's
too close to it,

593
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,630
she can't see
the facts clearly.

594
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,320
We need
to get inside Ella's head,

595
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,880
figure out where
she's taking Jay.

596
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,319
If you were her,
where would you guys go?

597
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,592
Ooh. Uh... strip club.

598
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,554
- Comic-Con.
- Bar.

599
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,194
A forensics
convention.

600
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,914
- Strip club.
- Dude, you already said that.

601
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,196
Why would Ella take her
brother to a strip club?

602
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,960
- For the free buffet.
- Above all else, Ella's dedicated

603
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,556
to her job. If she truly thinks
Jay is innocent,

604
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,433
she's gonna want
to prove it, which means...

605
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,040
She'll go back to
the crime scene.

606
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,319
So what's it gonna be,
Amenadiel?

607
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,519
You gonna help me die,
or vice versa?

608
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,672
Do as you must,
because I can't help you.

609
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,679
You're proud. I get it.

610
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,793
You don't want to upset Daddy.

611
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,798
You might not care
if you get killed.

612
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,597
Are you willing to let an
innocent die for pride?

613
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,198
You wouldn't.

614
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,437
I killed my own brother.

615
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,278
What makes you think

616
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,949
I wouldn't kill some random
person to finally have peace?

617
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,559
Maybe the guy wearing
the scarf indoors.

618
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,750
No one'll miss him.

619
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,117
Enough!

620
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,231
Yes. I gave you the mark.

621
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,435
But I was only
the messenger, Pierce.

622
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,956
I have no idea how to remove it.

623
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,679
Actually, I believe you.

624
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,474
Everybody out! Now!

625
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,916
What are you doing?!
I told you everything I know.

626
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,315
I thought you wouldn't
have been of any use,

627
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,517
but I needed to make sure.

628
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,196
So now what?

629
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,716
Well, now I finally get
to kick your angelic ass.

630
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,074
You know, that didn't feel
as good as I'd hoped.

631
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,237
But you know what they say.

632
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,351
At first you don't succeed...

633
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,914
This won't end well for you.

634
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,434
Your Shotokan's not bad.

635
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,750
How's your hapkido?

636
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,230
- Better than yours.
- Yeah?

637
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,156
This is getting fun.

638
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,033
Are you still having fun?

639
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,270
Don't make me do this.

640
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,358
Do what?
You gonna kill me?

641
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,159
Don't think a little death...
is gonna stop me.

642
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,155
Okay, walk me through
exactly what happened.

643
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,159
Like I said, I was
in the bathroom

644
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,874
when I heard
the gunshots.

645
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,316
Then I stayed quiet.

646
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,473
- After I saw the gunman leave, I came out.
- Whoa, whoa, wait.

647
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,110
You saw the shooter?

648
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,390
Yeah, I peeked
out from the door

649
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,034
and saw him standing
over Fahrid.

650
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,596
Jay, if you saw him,
you can identify him.

651
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,553
He wore all black
and a ski mask.

652
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,591
I-I didn't get a
good look at him.

653
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,395
Come on. Think, Jay. Think.

654
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,000
There has to be something
that you remember.

655
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,517
Wingtips. The guy wore
red wingtip shoes.

656
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,672
Does that help?

657
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,156
Everything helps.

658
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,233
Okay, so you said you saw him
from the bathroom, right?

659
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,640
Jay, the... door opens outward.

660
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,158
So?

661
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,149
So... Jay,
from your vantage point inside,

662
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,916
it would have been impossible

663
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,759
for you to see the killer
standing over the body.

664
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,679
Look, I saw what I saw.

665
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,354
Where's the stash room?

666
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,710
If Fahrid is
a diamond thief,

667
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,990
he'd definitely have
a stash room.

668
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,835
And if I were him,

669
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,873
I would hide it right...

670
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,711
here.

671
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,117
Looks like
laser-engraving equipment.

672
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,351
Ella?

673
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,874
What the hell, Ella!
Did you call the cops?

674
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,871
I trusted you!

675
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,878
No. I swear,
I didn't call them!

676
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,959
- This is much more fun than a strip club.
- Is that a stash room?

677
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,880
- Yeah. Full of laser-engraving equipment.
- Ah!

678
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,196
Seems that Don Zeikel fellow

679
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,920
you were telling me about
was onto something.

680
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,760
Who was onto what?

681
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,758
He's the insurance adjuster
for the missing diamonds.

682
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,838
He said that equipment replaces
the serial number

683
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,235
on the stolen diamonds.

684
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,794
Is that what you were doing?

685
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,836
Okay, fine.

686
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,355
Yeah, I was in here

687
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,960
cleaning the diamonds.

688
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,355
But it was a one-time thing.

689
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,439
Jay, stay calm.

690
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,632
Relax, Jay. We'll
go to the precinct,

691
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,560
talk about this,
figure it out.

692
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,918
But first you need
to put the gun down.

693
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,112
Why? No matter what
I say or do,

694
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,671
you're not gonna
believe me.

695
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,196
So what's the point?

696
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,716
Wait! You don't have to do this.

697
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,115
Oh, Ms. Lopez.

698
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,149
You still think he's innocent?

699
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,270
Well, Ellen...

700
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,950
...it's been fun.

701
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,236
You can't leave.

702
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,237
Why? Job's done.

703
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,477
But Jay needs our help! I mean,

704
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,234
so he got mixed up
with some bad dudes.

705
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,669
Okay, he's not a murderer.

706
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,640
He's like Harrison Ford,
but less growly.

707
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,831
The whole police force thinks
that he's guilty now.

708
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,633
<i>We</i> need to get to him first.

709
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,036
You hired me to find
him. I found him.

710
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,631
The fee doesn't include
post-seizure baby-sitting.

711
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:47,877
Please.

712
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,953
Fine.

713
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,990
I could stay...

714
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,310
for a price.

715
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,516
But...

716
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,598
I thought... you and I...

717
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,234
you know, we-we connected.

718
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,033
You really don't care at all

719
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,720
about helping me
find my brother?

720
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,112
You mean the brother
who forged diamonds,

721
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,312
pulled a gun on us,
probably killed a guy,

722
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,910
and who's definitely been
lying to you all this time?

723
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,713
No, not particularly.

724
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,310
Maybe you're right.

725
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,953
Maybe Jay's not who
I thought he was.

726
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,112
Maybe it was... all a lie?

727
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,917
No, but you know what?

728
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,271
Family shouldn't do that
to each other.

729
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,517
I mean, we're supposed
to help each other.

730
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,156
Okay.

731
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,476
Good talk.

732
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,475
No sign of him.

733
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,194
That was certainly exciting,
wasn't it?

734
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,278
- Go ahead. Say it.
- I...

735
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,755
"I told you so,
your brother's a killer."

736
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,992
Come on, say it... that you
were right all along.

737
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,590
Ms. Lopez, uh...

738
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,952
How could I have
been so blind?

739
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,556
I mean, Jay lied to
me about everything.

740
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,031
He obviously lied about
seeing the killer, too.

741
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,880
Not necessarily. Ella?

742
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,717
Wait. Maybe Jay did
see the killer,

743
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,396
not from the bathroom,
but from right here.

744
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,592
What exactly
did he say he saw?

745
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,234
Uh, a guy wearing a mask

746
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,637
and... red wingtip shoes.

747
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,479
Wingtips? Oh.

748
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,911
That's oddly strong
footwear game for a murderer.

749
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,197
Yeah. Stylish.

750
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,194
I think I know
who killed Fahrid.

751
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,072
Fahrid told me
you'd be at this hotel

752
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,075
right before
you killed him.

753
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,353
I'm not letting you get away
with this.

754
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,353
You're Fahrid's
diamond nerd.

755
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,598
I should've figured
you'd be in town.

756
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,554
I'm getting blamed
for what you did.

757
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,400
You're gonna confess
to the murder.

758
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,556
Whatever you want.

759
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,280
Let-let's go to the police.

760
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,716
I-I'll tell the truth.

761
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,991
No!

762
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,276
Do it right now.

763
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,516
Call the cops.

764
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,916
Sure thing.

765
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,674
Uh, can I use your phone?

766
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,637
Mine's dead.

767
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,032
Never held a gun
before, have you?

768
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,799
You're gonna kill me now, too?

769
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,879
No. Need you to clean
those diamonds, first.

770
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,630
Then I'll kill you.

771
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,990
Ella, you're
too close to it.

772
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,919
- No, Chloe, I can help. It's my brother.
- Hey, hey.

773
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,676
Just trust me, okay?

774
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,394
I promise you,
we got this.

775
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,396
That's gonna leave a mark,

776
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,436
at least for a little while.

777
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,709
We don't have to do this.

778
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,271
You didn't have to curse me,
either,

779
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,630
but you did that, didn't you?

780
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,436
Accept the punishment
that you deserve.

781
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,630
You know nothing

782
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,475
about what I deserve.

783
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,633
Oh, I know that my Father is
punishing you

784
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,870
because you killed
your own brother.

785
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,117
Yeah, notice anyone else in here

786
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,993
who plotted to kill
his own brother?

787
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,229
No, that was different.

788
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,110
Well, it was only different
'cause you failed.

789
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,960
We are nothing alike.

790
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,039
Yeah, you're right.

791
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,199
At least I had the balls
to do it myself.

792
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,600
You pawned the task off on
someone else, you're worse.

793
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,917
And if this is the punishment
that I get for my crimes,

794
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,236
what do you deserve?

795
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,593
There it is,
that look on your face.

796
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,513
That's what I wanted.

797
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,710
That feels good.

798
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,517
Little help?

799
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,836
Jay.

800
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,677
Get the hell
out of here,

801
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,360
crazy woman who I don't know.

802
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,631
And leave you with this psycho
killer, Jay? Are you nuts?

803
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,194
See? Left-handed.

804
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,959
- I knew you were innocent.
- Are you two done?

805
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,720
LAPD knows that you killed
Fahrid Nasser,

806
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,519
thanks to your
"on fleek" shoe game.

807
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,353
Look, Fahrid and I
had a good thing going.

808
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,154
For years, he'd
steal the diamonds,

809
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,994
I'd write the claim,
we split the money.

810
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,230
But the bastard
got greedy.

811
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,278
Cut me out.
Nobody cuts me out.

812
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,189
Look, man, I'll do
whatever you want.

813
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,636
Just leave her out of this.

814
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,758
Sorry. She's
seen my face.

815
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,070
You okay?

816
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,038
That's so Maze.

817
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,392
Hi.

818
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,351
Hey.

819
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,869
So, the knife...

820
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,190
just came out
of nowhere, huh?

821
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,711
Yep, just random blade
out of thin air.

822
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,191
I mean, anyone
could've thrown it.

823
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,112
Crazy.

824
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,549
Ella, I know it was Maze.

825
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,960
- Oh.
- Yeah.

826
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,277
She's my roommate.
I recognize the knife.

827
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,597
But don't worry,
she's not in trouble.

828
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,439
She was just trying
to protect you, right?

829
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,956
She saved my life.

830
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,235
So I doubt the DA
will press charges.

831
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,878
All he did was intend to
change the serial numbers

832
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,833
on the stolen diamonds;
it's not a crime.

833
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,951
Lucky Jay.

834
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,437
I'm sure if any other cop
had been working this case,

835
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,996
he would have ended up
in prison or worse.

836
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,675
So, well done, Detective.

837
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,400
Oh, my God.

838
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,233
Did the world just
turn upside down?

839
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,354
Did you just admit
to being wrong?

840
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,592
I wouldn't
quite go that far...

841
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,393
...but I'm sure if you
had a brother, he...

842
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,593
he would be very proud of you.

843
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,677
Thank you.

844
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,272
Anyway, this whole torrid affair

845
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,597
started with a bag
of stolen diamonds,

846
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,280
so where are the diamonds?

847
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,233
Well, we're still
checking Zeikel's stuff.

848
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,715
You know, houses, cars.

849
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,155
I'm sure they'll turn up.

850
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,352
Indeed.

851
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,871
Uh, did I forget something
at your office?

852
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,919
No. I, uh, I actually,

853
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,799
I actually came to apologize.

854
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,716
For what?

855
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,519
For refusing to treat you.

856
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,470
My extreme reaction

857
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,952
had nothing to do with
how scary...

858
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,316
...your story sounded.

859
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,160
Believe me, I've heard
much, much worse.

860
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,436
I was holding you accountable

861
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,677
for things you simply didn't do.

862
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,756
I hurt you, didn't I,
during my lost time?

863
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,271
It doesn't matter.

864
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,436
It wasn't you.

865
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,191
So if you want to come back
for a session,

866
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,471
I'd... I'd like to try and help.

867
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,835
I don't need handouts.

868
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,595
I mean, you don't have
to treat me.

869
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,756
I think I do...

870
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,710
for both of us.

871
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,875
I just have to
check one thing.

872
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:09,838
Ow!

873
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,470
Excellent.

874
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,198
Ah, the slow hand clap,

875
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,914
it never gets old, does it?

876
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,397
Hey, man.

877
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,110
It's not what it looks like.

878
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,151
Save it.

879
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,075
Evil Lopez.

880
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,878
Clearly this wasn't
a "one-time deal."

881
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,514
It seems you're not
quite as virtuous

882
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,598
as your sister would
like to believe.

883
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,673
Whatever, man. You don't know
what it's like

884
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,200
making sure
everyone's looked after.

885
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,396
It all falls on me.

886
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,956
Ah, so you felt entitled

887
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,760
to stick your hand in
the proverbial cookie jar

888
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,440
because it
"took care of your family"?

889
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,595
It started small.

890
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,480
I had to bail a brother out.

891
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,154
Then <i>Abuela</i> needed surgery.

892
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,880
Guess who they
all came to.

893
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,550
I didn't choose this.

894
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,559
But the Armani suit must help
ease the pain.

895
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,470
I take care
of my family,

896
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,311
so if I get a little
bit, too, so what?

897
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,190
I'm not perfect.

898
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,631
But you like them to think
that you are.

899
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,478
When, really, you're no better
than them.

900
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,755
You're gonna tell Ella,
aren't you?

901
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:29,991
All right, just...

902
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,276
let me do it.

903
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,520
She should hear it from me.

904
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,679
You're not gonna tell her
anything.

905
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,354
And neither am I.

906
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,717
You're not?

907
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,711
No.

908
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,916
Ms. Lopez puts a lot
of faith in you,

909
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,032
and losing that faith
would hurt her.

910
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,958
And I won't allow
that to happen.

911
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,914
I'll get my act
together, I promise.

912
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,316
No need to promise, Jay Lopez.

913
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,629
Because I'll be watching you,

914
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,191
and if you ever
disappoint her again...

915
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,874
I'll come for you.

916
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,519
Bloody hell.

917
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,878
What does the other
guy look like?

918
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,916
Immortal.

919
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,200
I'm the one that gave
Pierce his mark, Luci.

920
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,596
Right.

921
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,792
So that's why you wouldn't help.

922
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,717
Didn't want to remove
your handiwork.

923
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,832
All of this has nothing to do
with me.

924
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,473
I... I couldn't just remove it,
even if I wanted to,

925
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,474
because it's supposed
to be there.

926
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,071
Father cursed him for a reason.

927
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,951
I know you think

928
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,230
you're friends with Pierce.

929
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,318
I get it, but I am
warning you, Luci.

930
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,989
He has but one selfish goal.

931
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,793
And working with him

932
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,157
will only incur Father's wrath.

933
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,074
What the...?

934
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,712
That's the bloody point.

935
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,599
Look, I know...

936
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,792
you're just being
a good older brother.

937
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,392
Trying to protect me, 'cause
you think I need protecting.

938
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,474
Yes, that's right, because
I am my brother's keeper.

939
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,557
I am grateful,

940
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,392
Brother, truly, I am.

941
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,320
But I don't need protecting.

942
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,160
All that I am saying

943
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,630
is that this alliance with
Pierce will not end well.

944
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,796
Well, one can only hope.

945
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,400
And all I'm saying

946
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,438
is that if you
continue to meddle,

947
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,915
Amenadiel...

948
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,315
...then you will be in my way.

949
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,560
Well, then, Brother.

950
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,950
Yes.

951
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,832
I guess I'll be in your way.
