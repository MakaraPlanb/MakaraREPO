1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,914
<i>- Previously on</i> Lucifer...
<i>- Still no sign of Lucifer?</i>

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,679
<i>I went by his place.
He's gone.</i>

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,757
<i>Lucifer, who is this?</i>

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,679
Meet Candy Morningstar, my wife.

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,831
The issue? That would be
Lucifer disappearing

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,635
and then popping back up
with zero explanation

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,035
and a ditzy bimbo
on his arm.

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,680
I thought that she meant
something to you.

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,314
I had to save her from...

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,557
From you. You're not ignoring
Chloe, you're protecting her.

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,831
Are you going to Paris?
Can I be your travel buddy?

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,355
I love Paris.

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,951
This is the Paris Hotel
in Vegas.

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,799
Not going there.

15
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,474
Vegas and me... not pretty.

16
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,474
<i>And I have held
the real truth back from you.</i>

17
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,837
Why is it not working?

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,110
<i>You know, I keep caring,</i>

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,232
and you just... just...

20
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,760
No, Detective, I...

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,511
To you.

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,718
Oh, thanks.

23
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,035
No.

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,671
No. No.

25
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,950
Yes!

26
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,716
Finally, an X-rated
office party.

27
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,477
Leave it to you to
steal my thunder, huh?

28
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,396
Well, much as I'd love to
take credit for this, Daniel,

29
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,598
Officer Snake Hips
is not my doing.

30
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,995
Hmm, right.

31
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,231
Make it rain,

32
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,317
birthday girl.

33
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,394
- Was this you?
- Yep.

34
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,511
I did not see
that coming.

35
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,757
Hey, what can I say?

36
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,236
Big surprise, little package.

37
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,079
Big package, by the looks of it.

38
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,158
Slap it.

39
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,919
Slap it!

40
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,156
Oh. I'm sorry.

41
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,029
Lucifer Morningstar.

42
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,072
Las Vegas Police Department?

43
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,472
Candy? No, I-I'm gonna
stop you there.

44
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,478
She's my ex-wife, actually.

45
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,239
Can you believe it takes a year
to annul something

46
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,755
that only lasted
a couple of weeks?

47
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,757
No, I haven't spoken to her
for a few months.

48
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,996
Why do you ask?

49
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,629
What?
She's missing?

50
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,513
Uh, yes, yes, of course.

51
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,235
I-I'm in Los Angeles,
but if you do hear anything,

52
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,556
please contact me.

53
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,156
Aw, don't worry, buddy, look,
I got more singles for you.

54
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,750
Oh, no, no, no, I'm all right
for cash, thank you.

55
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,355
You okay?

56
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,714
That was the Las Vegas
Police Department.

57
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,877
It appears my ex,
Candy, is missing.

58
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,197
Oh, my gosh,
I hope she's okay, buddy.

59
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,669
Yes, as do I.

60
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,470
Candy was caught up
in some rather nasty business,

61
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,909
but I thought I'd
taken care of it.

62
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,395
- Nasty business?
- Yes.

63
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,715
In exchange, she helped me
with a delicate matter.

64
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,877
I hate to think I haven't
fulfilled my end of the bargain.

65
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,840
All right, I'll kill the music.
We'll all help find her.

66
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,680
Oh, no, no, no, no, um...

67
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,158
I don't want to spoil
the detective's celebrations.

68
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,556
No, I'll just beetle on over
to sin City

69
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,876
and check on Candy myself.

70
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,910
Oh, yeah, you know, I kind of

71
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,191
have a thing with Vegas.

72
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,234
Otherwise, I would totally,
totally offer to go with you.

73
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,840
Right. Good to know.

74
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,909
But then, I can tell that
it's really important to you,

75
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,715
and I do have the next
couple of days off, so...

76
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,675
okay, you've convinced me.

77
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,836
I will help you.

78
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,554
- What? I...
- Help him? Help him with what?

79
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,873
- Uh...
- Please don't tell me you guys got another stripper.

80
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,309
- No, he got a...
- Uh, no, no, no, no, no.

81
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,637
Nothing for the birthday
girl to worry about.

82
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,276
I want you to focus on one
thing only, Detective.

83
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,755
That is getting older.

84
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,836
Excuse me?

85
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,036
Wait, you're leaving?

86
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,991
Yeah, I'll call you later.

87
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,031
Wait.

88
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,477
Seriously, Detective,

89
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,875
you just stay here.

90
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,909
It's my birthday.

91
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,440
Shake your booty
while you still can.

92
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,475
Oh, there you go.

93
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,831
Mmm, you smell that?

94
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,636
That is pleather, cigars,

95
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,479
and vomit, my friend.

96
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,758
I have to say, I didn't
have a good Catholic girl

97
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,031
like yourself pegged
as a fan of Sin City.

98
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,600
Mm, not a fan, exactly.

99
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,190
More like a tiny,
helpless space capsule

100
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,869
being sucked into
a deadly black hole.

101
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,791
Anyway, shall we?

102
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,076
Uh...

103
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,917
Chloe again?

104
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,476
You know what they say,
fifth time's the charm.

105
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,397
Lucifer, you should really
tell her what's going on.

106
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,114
It's still her birthday.

107
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,233
And you're still
going with that.

108
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,237
Okay.

109
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,640
Officer.

110
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,591
Either it's someone
else's birthday...

111
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,031
Or this is an
active crime scene.

112
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,439
Oh, no.

113
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,796
Candy?

114
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,514
Oh, Lucifer,

115
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,439
I'm so sorry, buddy.

116
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,435
Man, her face is gone.

117
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,279
Hello.

118
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,710
Look at those dainty feet.

119
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,312
Okay, not judging here,
but really?

120
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,352
Is this really the time
for the pervy stuff?

121
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,471
Dainty feet?

122
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,110
Um, debatable, but that's not
what I was talking about.

123
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,630
No, Candy has ginormous feet.

124
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,796
I mean, regular boats,

125
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,877
huge.

126
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,153
That means that
this is not Candy.

127
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,073
Oh, man, that's awesome!

128
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,680
Shh.

129
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,636
Sorry,
my-my friend here.

130
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,839
Not a fan of the deceased,
I'm afraid.

131
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,951
Mean,

132
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,356
she was just so mean.

133
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,313
- Ah, you...
- Shh. Women.

134
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,275
- We should go.
- Mm-hmm.

135
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,149
Excuse me, I'm Detective Long,
and you are?

136
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,631
Um, Lucifer Morningstar.

137
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,472
Pleasure.

138
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,995
You're Candy's husband.

139
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,316
Ex-husband.

140
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,671
Right. I talked to you
on the phone.

141
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,156
You said you were
in Los Angeles.

142
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,157
Oh, yes.

143
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,238
And you don't seem
very broken up

144
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,994
about your ex-wife's death.

145
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,431
Well, that's because this woman
is not my wife.

146
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,474
Right, 'cause she's
your ex-wife.

147
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,558
Think you made that
pretty clear, buddy.

148
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,075
Hi, how you doing?

149
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,993
Ella Lopez, LAPD CSI.

150
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,550
For the record,
we just got into town.

151
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,114
Arrived at 1300 hours

152
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,754
and 14 minutes,
to be exact.

153
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,469
And, based on
a visual assessment

154
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,518
of the victim's lividity,

155
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,997
she's been deceased for,
oh, I'd say

156
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,760
2100 hours yesterday.

157
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,277
So, my travel buddy here,
not a suspect.

158
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,391
- Uh...
- Uh-huh.

159
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,235
Also, I know,
none of my beeswax, but...

160
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,233
I saw that you were going
with an ultraviolet light

161
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,630
on the couch.

162
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,910
I would have gone
with a straight oblique,

163
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,031
man, but you know what,

164
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,515
to each his own.

165
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,040
Okay, thanks
for the advice.

166
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,230
You got it, Detective.

167
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,639
Ixnay on the <i>ot-nay andy-cay.</i>

168
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,876
Sorry, is that German?
'Cause if it is,

169
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,150
it's absolutely awful.

170
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,919
Trust me, I should know.
Hitler was a talker.

171
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,276
Well, screamer, actually.

172
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,236
No, I'm saying that for now,

173
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,950
we shouldn't let LVPD know that
that's not Candy.

174
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,914
If this gets back
to the killer,

175
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,759
he might try to kill her again.

176
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,356
Oh, right, yes.
Good idea, Ms. Lopez.

177
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,631
- Good idea.
- What's a good idea?

178
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,350
- Um...
- Um...

179
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,476
To give you my card.

180
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,358
Her card.

181
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,593
In case you want
any more advice.

182
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,831
Always happy to help.

183
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,633
- She's very good.
- Very.

184
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,275
Right. I have a feeling
I will be talking

185
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,751
to both of you again
before the investigation's over.

186
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,757
I doubt that.

187
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,633
I mean, hanging out
with a cop in Las Vegas

188
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,718
is like bringing your grandma
to an orgy.

189
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,070
Am I right?

190
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:55,952
No.

191
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,077
Okay, bye.

192
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,714
Bye.

193
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,917
Hi.

194
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,437
Is, uh...
Hi, sorry to interrupt.

195
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,630
Have you heard from Lucifer?

196
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,633
No, why?
Has something happened?

197
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,799
No, not really.
I just, I, uh...

198
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,275
I had a question about a case,

199
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,039
and, um, I can't...
I can't get ahold of him.

200
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,838
Yeah, we were...

201
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,475
we were, uh, celebrating
my birthday at the precinct,

202
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,796
and, um, and then,
all of a sudden,

203
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,469
he just bailed, and now he's
not answering my calls, so...

204
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,713
Would you like to have a seat?

205
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,840
No, no, it's not a big deal.

206
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,157
You sure?

207
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,629
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I'm fine.

208
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:35,798
I'm fine.

209
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,514
It's probably just
Lucifer being Lucifer.

210
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,439
You know? Probably.

211
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:41,877
Yeah.

212
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,030
Please, have a seat.

213
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,037
I don't really, you know...

214
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,754
I know you're busy,
and I don't want to...

215
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,552
take up... I-I checked Lux,
and he wasn't there.

216
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,314
And-and I thought I'd go up
to the penthouse to check,

217
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,476
but last time he went AWOL,

218
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,518
I went up there
to check on him,

219
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,353
and all of his furniture
was covered in sheets,

220
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,273
and he had run off to Vegas.

221
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,920
Of course,
that's when we...

222
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,511
we were getting together,
which we totally are not

223
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,995
anymore, nor will we.

224
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,312
But, you know, it's my birthday.

225
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,396
Mm-hmm.

226
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,512
Wow, good couch.

227
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,631
I know.

228
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,840
And I understand.

229
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,552
Birthdays can be emotional.

230
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,871
I guess.

231
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,480
No, I'm good, I'm good.

232
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,637
He's, um... he's probably
just in the penthouse

233
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,990
passed out or something.

234
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,509
Emphasis on "something."

235
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,315
How about I go with you?

236
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,717
Please.

237
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,870
Seems Candy dodged a
bullet, quite literally.

238
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,514
Or a shotgun blast,
anyway.

239
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,837
Yes, so, we need
to find this killer

240
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,600
before he or she
realizes their mistake.

241
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,598
Detective Nosy in there
could get DNA back

242
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,240
on that body within 24 hours.

243
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,317
Yeah.

244
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,557
So, we got to
find a lead, stat.

245
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,558
- Right.
- Okay, so you were married to Candy

246
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,638
- for a week...
- Uh, two weeks.

247
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,753
Mm-hmm. I mean, any idea
who would want her dead?

248
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,438
Psychic bartender.
My favorite.

249
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:36,872
Who is she?

250
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,912
Not the one singing,
the reason you're drinking.

251
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,715
Not who I thought she was.

252
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,516
Not her fault, though.

253
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,756
Never is.

254
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,111
Ah?

255
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,154
Everyone's reading
my mind today.

256
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,631
Mmm.

257
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,873
Who was that?

258
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,271
That was Candy.

259
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,157
Aye.

260
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,315
Think I'd quite like to
continue my chat with Candy.

261
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,511
Uh...

262
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,230
Where's my money?

263
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,240
And my ring.

264
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,036
Bravo, Candy.

265
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,715
Emergencies.

266
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,120
Ow, you're hurting me.

267
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,760
Just-just give me
some more time, please.

268
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,750
I'll have it for you.

269
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,958
<i>His name's Louie Pagliani.</i>

270
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,675
He's a local loan shark
and all-around dirtbag.

271
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,514
I thought I dealt
with that human stain

272
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,750
last time I was here.

273
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,595
Yeah, well...
this is Vegas.

274
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,678
This town is always up for an encore.

275
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,359
Ah, there you go.

276
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,157
They teach lock picking
in forensic class?

277
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,835
No. Middle school.

278
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,515
Ms. Lopez, you are an enigma,
wrapped in a hoodie

279
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,194
under a jaunty ponytail.

280
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,277
It...

281
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,918
Oh, no.

282
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,875
The annihilation.

283
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,910
Ugh.

284
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,271
Even if Louie didn't
kill fake Candy,

285
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,989
this decor alone is enough
for immediate execution.

286
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,793
I mean...

287
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,070
What was he thinking?

288
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,876
Well, uh, looks like someone
beat you to the execution part.

289
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,792
Louie?

290
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,639
Oh, definitely.

291
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,752
I'd know those hairy
ham hands anywhere.

292
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,433
The trajectory
of the blood spatter

293
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,030
in relation to the stiff
makes zero sense.

294
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,799
There's no way
Louie pulled the trigger.

295
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,390
Typical Vegas.
Even the suicides are fake.

296
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,399
Yeah, and so is
the hair color.

297
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,157
Look at this.

298
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,480
- It's pink.
- Candy.

299
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,359
Well, she was here.

300
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,677
You think Candy
would've killed Louie,

301
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,678
and then faked her own death
to disappear?

302
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,118
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
Candy's not a killer.

303
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,238
No, just a thieving con woman.

304
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,676
- You knew her one week.
- Two weeks.

305
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,835
Well, you don't know
what she's capable of.

306
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,391
Well...

307
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,951
Candy did owe Louie
money once upon a time,

308
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,111
but I paid him off.

309
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,640
Perhaps he wanted more.

310
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,791
Huh.

311
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,757
This must be Mrs. Ham Hands.

312
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,114
Oh, dearie me.

313
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,317
Someone's sending
a painful message.

314
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,631
If Louie was after
Candy's candy...

315
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,431
Maybe his old
lady found out,

316
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,752
followed who she thought was
Candy home from the club,

317
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,634
shot her, and then
framed/finished off Louie.

318
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,911
Then we need to find
this murderous ginger

319
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,117
before she finds the real Candy.

320
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,994
Ah, Roxie Pagliani.

321
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,357
I suppose she's the missus.
Just block the caller I.D.

322
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,074
You can't just call her.
What are you gonna say?

323
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,312
Well, I'm gonna ask her
if she's the killer, of course.

324
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,315
No. Terrible plan!

325
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,795
- Give me that!
- What are you doing?

326
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,871
Hello?

327
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,316
Hi, yeah.

328
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,877
This is Marcia calling
from Sensational Statues.

329
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,718
Who?

330
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,519
"Sensational Statues"?

331
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,313
Yeah, yeah,
we got that new, um...

332
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,670
you know, that new...

333
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,673
oh, bust of Caesar you ordered.

334
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,439
Uh-huh, it came out real sexy.

335
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,717
- "Sexy"?
- Yeah, 30% off

336
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,992
if we can drop it
wherever you are right now.

337
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,873
I'm sorry,
I didn't buy any bust.

338
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,116
Pfft. You sure? Because I...

339
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,039
Bada bing! Bada bing! Bada bing!

340
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,834
Oh, whoopsie, whoopsie,
my mistake, doll, my mistake.

341
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,311
See?

342
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,074
The truth would've been
much more expedient.

343
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,040
Nope. I know exactly
where Roxie is.

344
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,555
I heard the sound

345
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,353
of The Guido's Rainbow
slot machine

346
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,914
in the background of the call.

347
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,560
It's a vintage machine.

348
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,434
And only one casino
in Vegas has it:

349
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,071
The Moonbeam.

350
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,514
Well, ka-ching, Ms. Lopez.

351
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,912
Well, no sheets
on the furniture,

352
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,190
that's a good sign.

353
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,840
And...

354
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,793
it looks like...

355
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,276
yep, the overnight
bag is missing,

356
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,960
so maybe he did
go out of town.

357
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,355
On my birthday.

358
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,239
You know what,
speaking of, this is stupid.

359
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,074
What are we doing here?
We should be celebrating.

360
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,636
Yes! We should
be celebrating.

361
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,832
Yeah.
So, where to?

362
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,951
Hmm.

363
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,200
Actually, I do know this place
with an awesome sound system

364
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,238
and all the top shelf
you can drink.

365
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,795
Best views in the city?

366
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,997
Seems a shame to let
that sunset go to waste.

367
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,476
<i>Hamlet!</i>

368
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,912
Ah.

369
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,956
<i>Hamlet.</i>

370
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,990
"Thanks for the punch up.
Love, Will."

371
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,557
Wow.

372
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,558
What you looking at?

373
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,276
Nothing exciting.

374
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,075
I'm Lucifer Morningstar.

375
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,752
I can play the piano
and I'm a fancy British man.

376
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,159
Let's go
take a peek in his sock drawer.

377
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,431
But, Dr. Martin,
you're his therapist.

378
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,994
Aren't there rules against that?

379
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,600
Trust me,
there's nothing I don't know

380
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,234
about Lucifer Morningstar.

381
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,636
Except what's in
his sock drawer.

382
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,429
It's not like he can see us.

383
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,960
Let's do it.

384
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,230
- Oh!
- Oh.

385
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,590
Oh, oh, oh!

386
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,790
- That's Lucifer, that's Lucifer.
- Oh. Oh.

387
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,831
- Yeah, I can see that.
- That's Lucifer.

388
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,997
Officially,
officially creeped out!

389
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:42,872
Okay, don't answer it.

390
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,480
No, no, no, wait.
Answer it, answer it, uh,

391
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,670
- just don't say we're here.
- Okay.

392
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,951
Mmm. Hello?

393
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,357
Ah, Doctor, I didn't
think you were going to answer.

394
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,756
I'm just calling to reschedule
my therapy appointment.

395
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,036
I'm on a quick trip out of town.

396
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,038
Oh!

397
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,680
Oh. Out of town.

398
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,838
Um, uh... where?

399
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,673
Oh, nowhere special,
it's just Vegas.

400
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,075
Vegas? Again?

401
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,879
What you doing in Vegas?

402
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,591
Well...

403
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,953
don't you look ravishing.

404
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,753
- Lucifer?
- Uh, sorry, I've got to go, Doctor.

405
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,480
- Speak soon.
- Bye.

406
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,916
What did he say
at the end there?

407
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,360
Um, something about...

408
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,350
radishes.

409
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,753
Well, you are
stunning, aren't you?

410
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,878
I almost didn't recognize you,
no offense.

411
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,833
Eh, it's hard to
get your glitter on

412
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,633
when you're stuck
in a lab all day.

413
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,117
But, I mean, Vegas?

414
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,318
Where else can I bust out
the bling?

415
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,795
There's no reason
we can't look fabulous

416
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,400
<i>and</i> catch a homicidal redhead.

417
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,790
Exactly.

418
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,514
<i>He didn't say "radish."</i>

419
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,154
He said "ravishing," didn't he?

420
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,240
He's in Vegas
with someone ravishing

421
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,796
on my birthday.

422
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,152
You know what?

423
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,395
Why-why do I even care?

424
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,633
Why do I care?
This is stupid.

425
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,554
Okay, feelings,
feelings are not stupid.

426
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,393
Well, this one is, okay?

427
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,597
This feeling is stupid.

428
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,031
- Okay.
- Okay?

429
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,720
Lucifer and I are friends,

430
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,753
partners, that's all.

431
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,555
I'm totally past
anything romantic.

432
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,310
Full-on rearview.

433
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,353
- In. The. Past.
- Okay.

434
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,557
It is completely reasonable

435
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,320
for something like
a trip to Vegas

436
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,718
to trigger old emotions.

437
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,876
Emotions...

438
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,999
that maybe you haven't
completely dealt with.

439
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,759
There's no
expiration date

440
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,231
on the process of healing.

441
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,150
We should go.

442
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,112
You're welcome.

443
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,159
Where... where
are my pants?

444
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,995
I was wearing pant...

445
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,071
Oh, this is fine...

446
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,559
Are you okay?

447
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,036
Oh...

448
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,712
Oh...

449
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,513
Screw the sock drawer.

450
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,276
Bada bing! Bada bing! Bada bing!

451
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,915
Oh, that is definitely her.

452
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,035
Mrs. Ham Hands.

453
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,590
It looks like she's
the casino's pit boss.

454
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,634
Right, let's go
and chat up our killer.

455
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,991
Uh, could be a problem.

456
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,795
Pit bosses are notoriously
hard to flush out.

457
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,316
Only clients they pay attention
to are the whales,

458
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,796
the serious high rollers.

459
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,276
So, how about blackjack?

460
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,550
More of a poker man, myself.

461
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,438
Poker?

462
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,995
No, poker involves bluffing,

463
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,350
also known as lying.

464
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,750
Something you claim

465
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,711
you don't do.

466
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,196
Bluffing and lying,
two totally different things.

467
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,959
So I guess what you're doing
with Chloe, and the whole

468
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:35,359
not telling her you're in Vegas
thing, also not lying?

469
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,995
No, that's selective omission.
Get it straight, Lopez.

470
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,431
Potato, potahto,
po-too-toe.

471
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,200
You, my friend,
are compartmentalizing.

472
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,880
Don't even know what that means.

473
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,315
Anyways...

474
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,272
Ooh.

475
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,433
Okay, looks like Roxie's
working the blackjack floor.

476
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,030
- Mm.
- So let's, uh, get you at the table.

477
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,038
What, me?
What about you?

478
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,476
Best I just watch.

479
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,836
Again?

480
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,157
Beginner's luck.

481
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,437
Right.

482
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,717
Let's see if this gets
Roxie's attention.

483
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,071
Oh.

484
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,272
Booyah. That's what
I'm talking about.

485
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,080
Well, it's so much fun to
bet lots and lots of money.

486
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,192
And there's plenty more
where this came from.

487
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,318
Ooh, nice. You have an 11.

488
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,670
Double down, baby,
double down.

489
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,997
Right-o, doubling down,
doubling down.

490
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,200
Yes!

491
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,800
- Very good, Ms. Lopez.
- See?

492
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,360
You're very good at this,
aren't you?

493
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,876
Teamwork is dream work.

494
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,912
Look at all the money, eh?

495
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,554
Do you know, actually,
I fancy a drink, actu...

496
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,631
- Ooh.
- Here you are.

497
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,280
Wonderful service.
Thank you.

498
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,231
What's your name?

499
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,791
Mmm.

500
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,231
Oh, that's
perfect, thanks.

501
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,631
What would you
like, Ms. Lopez?

502
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,194
I-I would like for you
to focus on the game;

503
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,356
you just got two aces.

504
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,875
What? Oh, right.

505
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,833
- Well, maybe you would like...
- Split!

506
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,269
Sorry.

507
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,589
Ah, it's working,
Ms. Lopez.

508
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,234
Whatever you're doing,
keep doing it.

509
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,119
- Yeah, order me one, too.
- Hmm?

510
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,198
Oh, well done, Ms. Lopez!

511
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,754
Well done, indeed.

512
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,674
Excuse me, sir.

513
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,677
Come with us, please.

514
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,518
Oh.

515
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,074
Excellent. It's worked,
it's worked.

516
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,033
Right, off to the high rollers'
suite, are we?

517
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,873
Yeah, I don't think
that's where they're taking us.

518
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,790
<i>What sort of casino
back room is this anyway?</i>

519
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,195
I mean, where's the
dangling lightbulb

520
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,436
and the
bloodstained floor?

521
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,796
Where's Joe Pesci?

522
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,719
Hey, go easy.

523
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,831
I'm going blind here.

524
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,912
It seems maiming us
isn't even in their agenda.

525
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,759
Quite frankly, I'm
disappointed, gentlemen.

526
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,280
Hmm, ooh.

527
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,552
Well, actually, I'm slightly
less disappointed now.

528
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,917
Oh.

529
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,431
It's you.

530
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,632
So maybe this wasn't
a total waste of time.

531
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,672
Mm, maybe we should
stop talking.

532
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,116
And by "we,"
I mean "you."

533
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,674
So, I guess the disguise
didn't do it for you.

534
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,714
Very few people can count cards
like you, Ms. Lopez.

535
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,389
Count cards?
Oh, I'm impressed.

536
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,950
So am I.
Your technique's so infamous,

537
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,197
we were able to spot you in,
what was it?

538
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,032
Half an hour?

539
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,153
43 minutes.
You guys are getting lax.

540
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,629
Question is,

541
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,434
what do I do with you?

542
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,997
If banning you from the casino
didn't work,

543
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,720
maybe I should call
your new friends

544
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,835
at the LAPD.

545
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,192
Okay.

546
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,039
Fine.
Go right ahead.

547
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,151
And, you know,
while you're at it,

548
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,670
why don't you tell them
about your crimes?

549
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,156
- What?
- Yes.

550
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,153
<i>J'accuse.</i>
First of all,

551
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,556
of mixing Corinthian
and Doric columns

552
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,790
in your McMansion.

553
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,753
I mean... and secondly,

554
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,919
of killing your husband and who
you thought was his mistress.

555
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,630
Louie's dead?

556
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,629
Hello.

557
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,796
Yes, Louie's dead,

558
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,560
savagely murdered by you.

559
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,557
Hmm.

560
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,391
Wow.

561
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,956
Her poker face is amazing,
take note.

562
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,636
My husband was a crook.

563
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,910
I knew it was
only a matter of time

564
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,435
before his ticket got punched.

565
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,757
But I certainly didn't kill him
or anyone else.

566
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,076
Okay.

567
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,873
Very well, Roxie,
if you didn't want Louie dead,

568
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,474
then tell me, what do you want?

569
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,072
I, uh...

570
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,396
Yes?

571
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,472
I want the pro golfer
on table four.

572
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,271
Bad.

573
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,313
I've been trying to pick up his
sweet ass for two days straight.

574
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,910
I worked a triple shift just
to keep him in my sights,

575
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,191
and I think I'm really close
to getting a hole in one.

576
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,272
You know what I mean?

577
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,556
Oh, dear.

578
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,156
Well, as the detective
would say

579
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,311
in this situation,

580
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,756
- that means no motive.
- Or opportunity.

581
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,877
Damn it, 6-6-6 didn't work,
either.

582
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,554
Try 8-0-0-8.

583
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,513
8-0-0-8?

584
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,711
It spells "boob."

585
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,713
Ah.

586
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,876
No.

587
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,474
You know, normally,
I wouldn't be so concerned

588
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,114
about trying to get
into this thing

589
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,357
if I didn't think there
were some real clues

590
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,710
as to where Lucifer is,

591
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,191
'cause wherever he is,
maybe he's in danger.

592
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,959
Right. Maybe "ravishing,"

593
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,675
I mean "radish,"

594
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,320
is code for "help."

595
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,876
Yes. Maybe, maybe
that's why he skipped town.

596
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,431
'Cause someone's
after him.

597
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,876
It would be irresponsible for us
not to open this thing.

598
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,800
Or maybe you two
just had too much to drink,

599
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,639
you're a little too curious
to leave well enough alone,

600
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,160
which is why
you hauled my ass out here.

601
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,550
That mean
you're not gonna help us?

602
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,070
I didn't say that.

603
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,399
You really have quite the grip,
don't you? Hmm?

604
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,473
You have a good time
on your own?

605
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,794
Okay. Ugh.

606
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,909
You are just full of surprises,
aren't you, my little <i>Rain Man?</i>

607
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,594
Well, what can I say?

608
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,156
We all have
coping mechanisms,

609
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,113
mine just happens to
be counting cards...

610
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,152
or, was, anyway.

611
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,476
Coping mechanisms,
for what?

612
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,598
Poverty?

613
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,311
No.

614
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,439
It helped quiet
the voices.

615
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,557
What voices?

616
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,675
Never mind, forget I...
said that.

617
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,793
The point is that...

618
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,673
everyone has stuff
that they want to avoid.

619
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,555
You know, like, like the way
you are avoiding Chloe.

620
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,479
Ugh, how many times
do I have to tell you?

621
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,990
I am not avoiding
or lying to the detective.

622
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,278
I'm... protecting her.

623
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,234
Ah, you're protecting her,
or you're protecting yourself?

624
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,476
Look, why are we
even discussing this?

625
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,154
Right now, Candy's the one
who needs protecting,

626
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,555
and we've just hit a dead end.

627
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,035
Right. Okay,
but hold on.

628
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,277
I mean, if we are
gonna find a new lead,

629
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,191
how about we start with
how you two ended up married.

630
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,551
Hello, Candy.

631
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,354
My thieving vixen.

632
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,235
I don't know what
you're talking about.

633
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,677
How'd you get in here?

634
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,872
Impressive grift
you've got going.

635
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,233
But, uh, I'm afraid that you
can't keep this little beauty.

636
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,033
No, please, please, please,
I'm sorry, I'm sor...

637
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,555
Sentimental value.

638
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,717
But, uh, you're welcome
to keep the cash.

639
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,634
Goodness knows
where you've hidden that.

640
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,111
I'm so sorry; please
don't call the cops.

641
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,356
It's just...

642
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,479
my dad died
recently and...

643
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,674
he used to own the
club I was singing at.

644
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,109
- You know, Fletcher's?
- Mm.

645
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,471
But he owed this ginormous
amount of cash

646
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,074
to this super scary loan shark,

647
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,318
Louie Pagliani, and he used
the club as collateral,

648
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,075
and if I don't come up
with 300 grand, like now,

649
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,709
Louie's gonna take it.

650
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,159
And who knows what else.

651
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,075
I didn't know what else to do!

652
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,197
Bravo, you really are
quite the performer, aren't you?

653
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,910
You, you don't believe me?

654
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,834
What, the weepy waterworks?
Not a chance.

655
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,958
But your story
seems legit, though.

656
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,271
It is.

657
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,109
And so is my apology.

658
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,359
I actually felt bad.

659
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,876
From the looks of you
at the bar,

660
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,037
you got your own problems
to deal with.

661
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,352
Yeah.

662
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,553
Nothing I can't handle
on my own.

663
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,716
You sure about that?

664
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,478
And so, you see, I...

665
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,875
I had to leave.

666
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,151
Hmm, I get it.

667
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,437
The part about your dad

668
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,109
putting the detective
in your path is kind of fuzzy,

669
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,679
but it seems like
you genuinely care about her.

670
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,550
Yes.

671
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,950
I do.

672
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,797
A lot.

673
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,038
Then, isn't you going AWOL
gonna kind of throw a big...

674
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,397
flag on that play?

675
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,831
No, I said that
<i>I</i> care about <i>her.</i>

676
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,679
Oh, unrequited love.

677
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,554
Yeah, I get that, too.

678
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,314
No, no, no, it's
not unrequited.

679
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,155
It's... well, the detective
has feelings for me,

680
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,999
but she has no control
over those feelings.

681
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,111
Okay, I don't get that.

682
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,476
Well, look,
it's difficult to explain.

683
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,718
But I just...

684
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,189
I just want to do right by her.

685
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,353
I believe you. Yeah.

686
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,357
Swap.

687
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,799
Do you ever ask yourself,

688
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,511
"How the hell
did I end up here?"

689
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,359
What, eating mint
chocolate chip ice cream,

690
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,676
wrapped in a pink Snuggie?

691
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,120
Pink's a good color for you,
actually.

692
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,073
Ah! You are a good
liar, aren't you?

693
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,077
I don't lie.

694
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,509
Forgive me,

695
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,956
but you are a con woman.

696
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,038
I am not a con woman.

697
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,151
I am a singer,

698
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,878
forced to do some things
that I'm not proud of,

699
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,595
but only so I can dig
my dad's club out of debt.

700
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,554
I grew up on that stage.
It's my home.

701
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,116
Drastic measures
for the things we care about.

702
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,437
That, I get.

703
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,754
I might pretend to be someone

704
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,873
a little less threatening
sometimes,

705
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,600
but I don't lie.

706
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,116
I call it bluffing.

707
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,351
Totally different things.

708
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,513
Oh, well, that I definitely get.

709
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,473
We're quite similar,
you and I, aren't we?

710
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,673
Yeah, we are.

711
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,755
Mm. Except for the fact
that you have ginormous feet.

712
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,757
Oh!

713
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,830
You know...

714
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,590
there might be a way for you and
I to dig each other out, Candy.

715
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,833
I'll pay off your debt
if you don't mind doing

716
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,918
a little "bluffing" for me.

717
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,231
Marry me.

718
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,752
Uh...

719
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,116
<i>And so, we got married.</i>

720
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,436
The end.

721
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,032
Hmm. Okay, so,
you fake-married Candy

722
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,714
to avoid Chloe,

723
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,520
even though you
cared about her.

724
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,435
Who's the enigma now?

725
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,709
- Don't even...
- Excuse me.

726
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,510
Sorry, did I forget to tip?

727
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,517
How rude of me.

728
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,631
Lucifer.

729
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,197
Candy?

730
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,511
What are you doing here?
You're gonna ruin everything.

731
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:05,917
I...

732
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,638
Uh...

733
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,716
As much as I love the
Bettie Page vibe, you've got

734
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,832
a bull's-eye on your back; this
is hardly a good hiding place.

735
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,594
- But it is where my killer works.
- But...?

736
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,474
You're onto Roxie as well?

737
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,998
Until you and your sidekick
derailed things.

738
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,919
Not my sidekick, and
I hate to disappoint,

739
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,237
but Roxie Pagliani
did not kill your look-alike.

740
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,271
Ali.

741
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,150
Her name was Ali.

742
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,757
She broke up with her boyfriend,

743
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,155
so I said
she could stay with me.

744
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,956
I was just trying
to be a good friend.

745
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,471
Oh, man.

746
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,990
I'm so sorry.

747
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,076
Anyway.

748
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,439
Anyway, Roxie Pagliani
did not kill Ali

749
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,239
or her husband in a
jealous fit of rage.

750
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,432
I mean, the woman's about as
passionate as a protein bar.

751
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,154
This has nothing to do
with passion.

752
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,597
The killer wants
my father's club.

753
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,156
Fletcher's?
How do you know that?

754
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,116
After I found Ali dead,

755
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,279
I noticed there was only one
thing missing from my apartment.

756
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,000
The pocket deed for Fletcher's.

757
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,157
Whoever possesses the deed
owns the club.

758
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,271
It was used
as collateral

759
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,800
when my dad
borrowed money from Louie.

760
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,874
But when I went
to confront him,

761
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,309
he was already dead.

762
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,910
Oh, that's why her hair
was at the crime scene.

763
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,635
So I thought, well, maybe Louie
told Roxie about the deed,

764
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,990
and she's the one
who got greedy.

765
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,156
Sadly, no.

766
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,840
Roxie was working
at the time of the murder.

767
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,874
But who else could've known
about that deed?

768
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,476
Well, not to worry.

769
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,280
There's a much faster way
to flush out the killer.

770
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,311
Candy's still my wife.
Legally, anyway.

771
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,996
Which would trump
any sort of deed.

772
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,674
Exactly, which means Fletcher's

773
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,270
now goes
to the grieving widower, me.

774
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,914
Yeah, but
that makes you

775
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,071
the killer's next target.

776
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,192
Oh, I certainly hope so.

777
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,320
Right. Come on.
Showtime.

778
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,598
Showtime?

779
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,914
But not tonight.

780
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,713
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

781
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,112
My name is Lucifer Morningstar,
new owner here at Fletcher's.

782
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,879
That's right, owner.

783
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,432
Please, a warm welcome
for The Morningstars.

784
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,199
Are you buying any of this?

785
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,317
Well...

786
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,318
Lucifer's certainly
made his presence known.

787
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,318
So, any sign of the killer?

788
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,911
Any weird or
suspicious activity?

789
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,674
Other than your high kick,
no, sorry.

790
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,999
You try dancing with a.22
strapped to your thigh.

791
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,995
Creepy hunched fellow,
two o'clock.

792
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,270
Got it.

793
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,671
Blue tracksuit,
big guy, big guy.

794
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,440
Yeah, yeah, that's the guy.

795
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,711
All clear.

796
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,752
The only thing he cares about
are the complimentary crab legs.

797
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,755
Thank you.

798
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,953
Oh, thank you all so much.
I'm here all night.

799
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,159
No, seriously, <i>all</i> night.

800
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,639
And now we wait for
the real show to begin.

801
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,591
Mm-hmm.

802
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,116
- Whoops.
- Whoops?

803
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,276
As in it worked?

804
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,677
Well, uh...

805
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,194
- Oh. Oh, don't worry.
- Oh.

806
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,911
I've had a lot of experience
with giant holes...

807
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,674
- ...in walls.
- Hmm.

808
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,956
A little Spackle
and you're good to go.

809
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,475
Well, it's a good thing
I come packing.

810
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,551
Came packing Spackle?

811
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,399
Of course.

812
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,040
I'll be right back.
Excuse me.

813
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,236
This...

814
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,192
...look at this.

815
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,237
This is nuts.

816
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,517
Yeah, but super fun.

817
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,674
This is...

818
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,633
it's pointless
cracking into this safe

819
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,433
because no matter
what we find,

820
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,429
there are things

821
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,950
about Lucifer that
I will never understand.

822
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,199
Spackle's not gonna help
the Assyrian antique wall.

823
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,799
I think you and I both know
that this isn't about Spackle.

824
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,473
He left on my birthday.

825
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,473
And I wasn't
expecting a big party

826
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,957
or anything huge, maybe a card.

827
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,316
You know, Lucifer
is a nontraditional guy.

828
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,040
And he celebrates

829
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,153
in... nontraditional ways.

830
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,232
Right, like going to Vegas
with some radish.

831
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,430
Lucifer cares for you.

832
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,710
I'm sure he's gonna come back

833
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,838
with some crazy
explanation that...

834
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,317
That I'll probably never
hear about and that's fine.

835
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,790
It's fine.

836
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,356
I just hate that I sound jealous
'cause I'm not.

837
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,596
I'm not jealous.

838
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,079
I'm not, I just, um...

839
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,353
He's just my friend, you know?

840
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,271
I know.

841
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,190
What did I tell you?

842
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,795
I am the man.

843
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,316
Cheers.

844
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,791
To the weirdest birthday
I've ever had.

845
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,474
And thank you for the party,
such as it is.

846
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,040
Oh, dearie me.

847
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,356
Rough night, old boy?

848
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,639
I'm sorry, but-but this place...

849
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,990
is mine.

850
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,831
Well, well, well,
it seems our bad guy

851
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,679
is the good bartender.

852
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,670
You can forget the tip,

853
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,870
by the way.

854
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,390
First of all, excellent bluff,
Mr. Killer Bartender,

855
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,000
but I do need to tell you...

856
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,433
I do need to tell you...

857
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,354
What I was trying to tell you

858
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,119
before you
so rudely interrupted me

859
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,959
is that because
I know you're the killer

860
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,150
and you can't kill me,

861
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,840
you may as well just
hand yourself in now.

862
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,554
- But I just shot you.
- Yes, I know.

863
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,155
It's perplexing,
isn't it, Juddy?

864
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,356
Judd?

865
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,635
How could you?

866
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,276
Candy?

867
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,793
No, you-you can't be here. I...

868
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,550
I killed you!

869
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,513
What the hell is
happening to me?

870
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,880
Who are you talking to?

871
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,276
You can't see her?

872
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,277
- Hmm?
- But...

873
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,670
Oh, God.
What the hell?

874
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,270
Well, interesting turn
of phrase, actually, Juddy,

875
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,755
because I am the Devil

876
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,237
and I believe that
you're being haunted.

877
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,033
Perhaps if you
repent your sins,

878
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,515
all will be forgiven.

879
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,949
The truth will set you free
and all that.

880
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,640
You were like
a son to my father,

881
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,280
a brother to me.

882
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,711
I was gambling again.
I was drowning in debt.

883
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,354
Why didn't you just tell me
you needed money?

884
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,393
Because you
don't have any!

885
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,280
This place is
worth crap.

886
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,119
It's the land that's
worth millions.

887
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,880
I tried to get your dad to sell
and I knew you wouldn't, either.

888
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,595
So, you shot me
in the back of the head.

889
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,790
Yes.

890
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,714
Yes, I did.

891
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,710
Now go away!

892
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,231
Oh! There we go, Juddy.

893
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,476
Leave me alone!

894
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,796
Fire away!

895
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,435
That's it. You're like a kid
in a candy store, aren't you?

896
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,960
That's it, Juddy, go on!

897
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,114
My leg!

898
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,634
Excellent shot, Ms. Lopez.
Another hidden talent.

899
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,996
Thanks.

900
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,751
And don't worry, I'll give
you props for the arrest.

901
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,236
I'm cool like that.

902
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,069
Gee, thanks.

903
00:38:59,200 --> 00:38:59,951
Hi.

904
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,318
I just wanted to say thank you
for saving my ass... again.

905
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,715
It's what any good husband
would've done.

906
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,997
Come on. Drinks
on the house.

907
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,038
Uh, much as I'd love to,

908
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,794
once Lola over there
finishes flirting,

909
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,793
we need to get back to L.A.

910
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,430
Speaking of L.A.,

911
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,394
whatever happened
with the detective?

912
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,871
Mess it up yet?

913
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,310
Not yet, but I-I fear
I may be about to.

914
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,159
Then what the hell
are you still doing here?

915
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,511
Go home, you Devil.

916
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,433
Right.

917
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,359
You take care.

918
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:35,758
Yeah.

919
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,793
Lopez! Get a wriggle on!

920
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,719
Well, I'm sorry I missed it.

921
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,519
Could use a drink myself.

922
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,310
I'm not exactly sure

923
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,671
what you're all doing here,
but I...

924
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,679
imagine it's something to do
with the fact that I wasn't.

925
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,229
And the truth is...

926
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,877
I... went to Las Vegas.

927
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,912
And even though it was
for a very good reason,

928
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,952
I didn't tell you because...

929
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,872
last time I went
on a Vegas jaunt,

930
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,311
there were some very unpleasant
feelings involved

931
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,190
for both of us.

932
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,996
And, well, I didn't want to
dredge any of those up again.

933
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,999
So, I... bluffed.

934
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,954
But I've come to realize
that perhaps bluffing

935
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,879
is the same as lying and that's,

936
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:30,357
as you know,
something I never want to do.

937
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,160
Especially to you.

938
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,595
Hello.

939
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,320
Someone's been busy.

940
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,435
Oh, perfect timing.

941
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,396
You've woken up just in time
for your surprise.

942
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,840
A surprise? What surprise?

943
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,389
Well, forgive
my tardiness,

944
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,911
but I thought it prudent to
deliver your gift in private.

945
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,551
Thank you.

946
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,431
Oh.

947
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,397
Just beautiful.

948
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,920
Oh, it's...

949
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,269
- What is it?
- What?

950
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,797
It's the bullet

951
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,477
from when you shot me.

952
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,831
Remember in the warehouse,
early in our partnership?

953
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,318
Oh. Yeah.

954
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,151
I remember.

955
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,478
Well, I thought since I'll
never likely penetrate you,

956
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,672
I'd commemorate the one time
you penetrated me.

957
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,915
So, uh, happy birthday,
Detective.

958
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,116
Oh.
