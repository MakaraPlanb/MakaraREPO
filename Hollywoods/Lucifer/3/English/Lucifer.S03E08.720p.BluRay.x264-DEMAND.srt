1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,635
<i>- Previously on</i> Lucifer...
- We're separated.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,997
Sign the divorce papers.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,839
What's with the cold shoulder?
You seduced me.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,713
You almost die, and then
you ghost me for weeks.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,879
Nothing about any of that
makes any sense to me.

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,753
Doesn't make any sense
to me, either.

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,510
I used to see a light in you.
All I see now is darkness.

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,712
I just wanted
to say thank you

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,599
<i>for saving my life.</i>

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,671
Decker, gun!

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,837
<i>He saved my life.</i>

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,718
<i>Chloe's fine.</i>

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,711
<i>Luckily, Pierce was with her.</i>

14
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,030
But I wasn't.

15
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,675
- Happy birthday, Detective.
- Beautiful.

16
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,593
- What is it?
- It's the bullet.

17
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,751
From when you shot me.

18
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,598
Oh.

19
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,153
Mm, this is
a new one on me, Detective.

20
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,829
Mm, mm, well,

21
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,269
there's a first time
for everything.

22
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,840
Yes, but I've heard
it can take hours.

23
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,838
I'm not sure even I have
the endurance for that.

24
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,838
- Mm...
- Don't worry, I'll help you.

25
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,796
I'll be the top hat.

26
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,273
I will be the race car,

27
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,314
because I'm gonna
leave you both in the dust.

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,636
Very funny.

29
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,435
Uh, wheelbarrow,

30
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,916
shoe, ah...

31
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,556
Guess I'm gonna have
to be the shot glass.

32
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,797
- Cheers.
- Oh, that's a thimble.

33
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,039
What? What? I want to conquer
real estate, not mend socks.

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,634
- So then be the shoe.
- Please,

35
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,916
I am not a shoe.

36
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,112
Clearly I'm a top hat,
so come on, hand it over.

37
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,915
Want it?
It's gonna cost you.

38
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,671
Oh, well, name
your price, urchin.

39
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,352
Oh, I'm not talking fake money.

40
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,711
Oh, wow, she slammed you.

41
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,511
Imagine my disappointment

42
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,713
when I realized
there was no raging party.

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,840
It's a security thing.

44
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,110
Worked for that
<i>Home Alone</i> kid,

45
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,073
but, obviously,
you can't take a hint.

46
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,953
Wasn't I being clear
last time I kicked you out?

47
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,913
Oh, clearly being a jerk.

48
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,272
Which is exactly why
I came to look in on you.

49
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,676
You see, we need the most love

50
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,916
when we're being most unlovable.

51
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,112
No offense, Brother,
but I don't need love from you.

52
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,754
I get plenty
from naked strangers.

53
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,996
And speaking of,
I'm spent.

54
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,316
So, if you don't mind...

55
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,397
That's where
you've been, then,

56
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,432
having sex with
the nameless masses?

57
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,075
Oh, you know me, Brother,
wine, women and song.

58
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,313
Just, come on, run along.
I don't need a babysitter.

59
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,075
Your cheek says otherwise.

60
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,831
Well, it turns out
"Bruce Lee mid-fly kick"

61
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,799
wasn't in the artist's
repertoire.

62
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,111
Look, I had to cut a deal
with the detective's offspring.

63
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,159
So that's who
you were with...

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,400
Chloe and Trixie.

65
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,439
Well, so much for
wine, women and song.

66
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,637
Technically, all of those things
were represented,

67
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,116
when you count
the post-game karaoke.

68
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,994
Luci, there's absolutely
nothing wrong with...

69
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,078
with enjoying
a quiet night in.

70
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,237
I did not say that I enjoyed it.

71
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,199
Yeah, right. Honestly,
Luci, who cares

72
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,352
how you spend your nights?

73
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,399
Um, everyone.

74
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,196
My exciting lifestyle gives
regular people

75
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,471
something to aspire to...
I provide hope.

76
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,911
I see. And how does
Linda feel about this

77
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,230
little ruse of yours?

78
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,796
I'm sure that the doctor
would love to dissect me,

79
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,110
but she's taken some time off

80
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,039
to deal with a death
in the family, so...

81
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,560
I had no idea.

82
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,871
I should go check on her.

83
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,675
Yes, excellent idea.
You do that.

84
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,238
Luci, I'm liking
this new you.

85
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,680
Boring suits you, Brother.

86
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,676
Now, this poor victim,

87
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,075
she is boring.

88
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,951
- We don't know anything about her.
- Oh, don't we?

89
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,470
Generic artwork,
dull clothes,

90
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,750
beige furniture.

91
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,952
I mean, even her fruit bowl's
so tragically safe...

92
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,554
no mangoes, no papayas.

93
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,160
Not even a measly avocado.

94
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,473
Her name's Kim Jones, 29.

95
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,591
She's a computer
engineer.

96
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,393
We ran a full
background check,

97
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,193
but we couldn't find
anything noteworthy.

98
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,280
A fellow nerd.

99
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,160
I'm sure you're in
a better place now.

100
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,874
Well, even if she's
in the worst place,

101
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,560
it'd be far more interesting
than this,

102
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,951
because this poor lady,
definitely a shoe.

103
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,750
Any idea what he's
talking about?

104
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,040
Oh, the other night
we played Monopoly.

105
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,829
So, that's that story.

106
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,156
Ella, what's the cause of death?

107
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,430
Uh, BABFT.

108
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,712
Hmm?

109
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,718
Big-ass blunt force trauma
to the head.

110
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,600
Murder weapon's missing,

111
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,077
but we are looking
for something small and compact.

112
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,716
Surprisingly heavy for its size.

113
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,914
Kind of like my Aunt Rosalita.

114
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,389
I wish Amenadiel were here
so he could see

115
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,114
what boring actually looks like.

116
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,198
Can you believe that
he said I've become boring?

117
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,390
It's absurd.

118
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,431
Oh, I don't know.

119
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,757
Monopoly doesn't really sound
like the old Lucifer.

120
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,480
And I have to say,
you have become a bit

121
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,080
more normal.

122
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,078
- How dare you.
- Crazy idea.

123
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,192
Let's talk less about Lucifer
and more about the murder.

124
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,232
Crime-scene selfies?
Really?

125
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,710
Classy move.

126
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,799
And that is Esther,
our victim's roommate.

127
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,310
She found the body when she
came home from partying.

128
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,438
Well, what's such
a dynamic young lady doing

129
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,915
living with a... Kim?

130
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,036
Oh, never mind,
she looks traumatized.

131
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,640
- I'll go comfort her.
- Uh-huh.

132
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,594
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Hel...

133
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,515
No photos
at a crime scene.

134
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,110
Sorry.

135
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,440
Not even one last one
with the handsome cop?

136
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,597
Don't let the boring
detective spoil things.

137
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,836
It would be my pleasure.

138
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,911
Right.

139
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,160
Oh.

140
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,589
Bless your heart.

141
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,956
Obviously, I'm far
too well-dressed

142
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,951
to be a cop.

143
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,354
So, I take it that

144
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,313
you aren't close
with your roommate?

145
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,313
No, I don't spend
much time here.

146
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,870
Obviously.
Besides, me and Kim,

147
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,993
totally different squads.

148
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,115
Kim followed more people
than followed her,

149
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,716
if you know what I mean.

150
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,149
# Shoe.

151
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,153
Can you think of anyone
who would want her dead?

152
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,991
I don't think anyone wanted
much of anything from Kim.

153
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,560
Okay, well,
there was no break-in,

154
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,160
there was no struggle,
which likely means

155
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,470
that Kim knew the killer.

156
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,114
So, can you think of anything?

157
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,073
A recent breakup, a fight?

158
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,399
She did get into
a yelling match

159
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,159
- on the phone last night
- Oh.

160
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,319
But I assume that was with
the Thai delivery place.

161
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,079
And I assume that's
the poor dear's

162
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,316
closest relationship?

163
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,159
What time was the...
the argument?

164
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,397
I'll tell you

165
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,074
if you hand me
my phone back.

166
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,355
I was getting ready
to go out,

167
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,752
and I totally remember the pic
I was uploading at the time.

168
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,674
Kombucha martini.
10:39 p.m.

169
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,192
All right, I'll trace
Kim's phone call at that time.

170
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,236
You guys mind if I post
that I'm totes helping

171
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,800
a police investigation?

172
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,956
Absolutely.

173
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,395
Do you mind tagging me?

174
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,751
Ella traced Kim's call
to this business.

175
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,680
Top Meet. Interesting name
for a Thai restaurant.

176
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,953
No, it's a dating app for
L.A.'s most fabulous singles.

177
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,276
Super exclusive.

178
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,800
Seems you need
to get recommended

179
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,912
and meet a bunch
of selection criteria,

180
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,952
even go through an interview
just to create an account.

181
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,629
Well, then, why would our victim
be arguing with someone here?

182
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,116
I mean, this is clearly
a place for top hats, like us.

183
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,276
Please, I would never get
into something like this.

184
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,317
Eh, you're right.
What was I thinking?

185
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,870
It's way too exciting
for you, Detective... I meant me.

186
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,960
And him.

187
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,914
Gosh, kindred souls.

188
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,237
This interesting young fellow
and I, wouldn't you say?

189
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,200
Except that, apparently,

190
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,278
he's slightly more
interesting than you.

191
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,278
Well, journalistic
hyperbole, clearly.

192
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,391
- Eh...
- Can I help you?

193
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,597
Oh.

194
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,992
Mack Slater.
I'm the CEO.

195
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,877
If you are here for the
selection interview,

196
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,560
I'll spare you.
I created Top Meet

197
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,393
for people exactly like you.

198
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,829
Oh, well,
thank you very much.

199
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,074
I'm actually...
I was talking to the lady.

200
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,951
You're exactly my type.

201
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,750
I mean the app's type.

202
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,996
Bit on the nose there,
Big Mack.

203
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,157
We're here for a different
kind of interview.

204
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,716
There's been a murder,
and our victim's last call

205
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,149
was to someone
in this building.

206
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,110
A homicide detective, huh?

207
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,273
- Uh-huh.
- Wow. You just got even more interesting.

208
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,751
Funny, so did you.

209
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,351
Just found out who our victim
was fighting with... you.

210
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,351
Ah. Most interesting
bachelor, indeed.

211
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,956
If you didn't know her,
then how did you fight with her?

212
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,510
'Cause she was nuts.

213
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,352
I'm confused, you just said
you didn't know her.

214
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,949
I know her type.

215
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,190
We get them from time to time.

216
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,517
They want to be on Top Meet,

217
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,120
they can't clear our high bar,

218
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,470
and then they get pissed
about it.

219
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,952
Problem with her was she just
wouldn't take no for an answer.

220
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,960
And then, uh, she hacked
her way onto my app,

221
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,594
and then our users
complained, of course.

222
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,474
Because nobody joins Top Meet
to hook up with some...

223
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,760
random nobody, and so
we had to kick her off.

224
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,394
Okay, and is that
when she got angry

225
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,397
and called to complain?

226
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,796
No, it was more
like she went psycho.

227
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,555
Ah, well, boring people never
like to be told they're dull.

228
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,750
Right, Detective?

229
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,190
What did you do
after the call?

230
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,119
I stayed here, I worked late.

231
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,000
We've been busy as hell
these days.

232
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,554
Not nearly, I can assure you.

233
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,310
Well, I'd like to talk to anyone
who can corroborate your alibi.

234
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,432
Also, I'll need a list
of any of the users

235
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,591
that complained about Kim.

236
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,677
No can do.

237
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,996
With so many celebrity clients,

238
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,237
our entire business model
is based off

239
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,233
our ironclad privacy protocols.

240
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,830
Fine, I'll just
get a warrant.

241
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,111
Good luck with that.

242
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,840
I mean, how long
did it take the FBI

243
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,315
to hack one cell phone?

244
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,880
Yep, I'll have
the tech team get on it.

245
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,833
You got it, Chloe.
Ah!

246
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,400
Hello, Ms. Lopez.

247
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,400
I wanted to ask you something.

248
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,956
You know this darkness
that you say you see in me?

249
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,232
- Mm-hmm.
- I've been trying to address it,

250
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,200
and, uh, details would help.

251
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,149
So, where do you
see it, exactly?

252
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,079
How? When?

253
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,760
Like, now.

254
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,714
Right about there.

255
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,437
Oh.

256
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,797
Hmm.

257
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,072
Little better?

258
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,555
But you know, still,

259
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,593
you don't exactly scream
rainbows and sunshine,

260
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,837
even when you're not
wielding murder weapons.

261
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,158
Well, for the record,
I wouldn't stab you,

262
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,511
not here, with all
these cops around.

263
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,197
Oh, come on, that was funny.

264
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,676
Oh, yeah.
Ha, ha. Funny.

265
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,154
Also dark.

266
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,396
Right. Fair point.

267
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,320
But it's cool.

268
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,512
You know, being dark.

269
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,560
To each their own,
you know?

270
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,237
Wow, you really have this
"being good" thing down.

271
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,317
Huh?

272
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,190
You know, you might be
just the person to guide me.

273
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,152
To where?

274
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,431
Somewhere other than Hell.

275
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,076
See, I've, um, I've learned

276
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,478
that there are consequences
to my darkness.

277
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,310
Really permanent ones,
as it turns out.

278
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,200
And I was thinking
you could help me avoid them?

279
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,311
No way, José.

280
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,391
I mean, I wish
I could help you, I do,

281
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,637
but I'm so busy.

282
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,160
- With what?
- You know.

283
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,431
Cases, forensic stuff.

284
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,032
The lieutenant won't be back
from medical leave

285
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,800
until next week, so it's, like,
cray-cray up in here.

286
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,436
Oh, hey, Dan.

287
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,512
I bet you need me
to go do that thing, huh?

288
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,792
That super urgent
forensic thing.

289
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,070
Yeah, yeah. See?

290
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,556
Cray-cray.

291
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,837
Well...

292
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,277
I'm just gonna...

293
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,751
- I was...
- Yeah.

294
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,197
Bye.

295
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,759
Excuse me.

296
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,710
<i>You know,
you're exposing yourself</i>

297
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,639
<i>to dreadful consequences.</i>

298
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,639
And I'm not talking
bad Yelp reviews,

299
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,876
I'm talking Hell.

300
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,993
Real.

301
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,190
I know.

302
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,629
I know, right?

303
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,115
Shocker to me, too.

304
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,552
But not as much as your dancing
queen candle arrangements!

305
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,151
Hey,

306
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,272
Linda.

307
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,437
- Is everything okay?
- Amenadiel, hi.

308
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,909
I'm so glad you're here.

309
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,199
I'm trying to plan
my ex-husband's memorial,

310
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,835
and I could really use
another opinion.

311
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,319
Um, okay. So, which one
do you like best?

312
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,597
Just, knee-jerk reaction.

313
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,438
Go.

314
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,471
That one?

315
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,511
Really?

316
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,149
Really? You don't think
it's too ornate?

317
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:00,992
That one.

318
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,117
You're right.

319
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,874
This one's simple,
yet elegant.

320
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,279
See, you're just
the insight I needed.

321
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,916
Busy tomorrow?

322
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,718
That looks
absolutely nothing

323
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,916
like our victim.

324
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,395
Take note, Daniel.
These filters

325
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,000
could be the answer
to your dating drought.

326
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,077
Or not... I mean,

327
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,077
Kim only got one match.

328
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,950
What... really?

329
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,230
After all the effort
our shoe went through

330
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,999
to make herself
look like a top hat,

331
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,350
she only got the interest
of one gentleman?

332
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,233
Gentleman? You mean suspect.

333
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,076
Yep. Username,
FOREVER29.

334
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,350
The app arranged
a date for them,

335
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,000
and based on their likes
and locations,

336
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,919
it suggested a sushi place
on Melrose.

337
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,794
Even made a reservation for them
for the night of the murder.

338
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,877
This guy's
using the app

339
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,276
as a hunting ground; he could be
targeting somebody right now.

340
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,231
We got to find him.

341
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,352
Yeah, but how?
We can't even get an I.D.

342
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,880
Yeah. Tech team hasn't
been able to crack

343
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,400
Top Meet's security algo.

344
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,195
Which means Kim had
mad hacking skills.

345
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,471
So can we use
FOREVER29's profile pic

346
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,239
and run it through
facial recognition?

347
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,831
Yeah, I know, I thought
about that, but...

348
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,430
Partial profiles pics.

349
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,512
Such a telltale sign
of low self-esteem.

350
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,274
Or our guy's keeping
his profile secret

351
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,231
because he's the killer.

352
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,159
Wait a minute, there is
some good news, you guys.

353
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,159
He used the app to RSVP
for a mixer at Top Meet.

354
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,157
It's happening tonight.

355
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,350
Okay. We got to get
to this party.

356
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,796
Use what we know about FOREVER29
and single him out.

357
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,911
Okay, fine. I'll go.

358
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,157
Seeing as I'm the only
interesting single person here,

359
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,033
I think I'm our one shot
to catching the killer.

360
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,390
Lucifer, we're looking
for a guy.

361
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,238
Your point?

362
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,072
Uh...

363
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,760
He's a dude. And he's straight.

364
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,639
- Mm-hmm.
- That's never stopped me before, Daniel.

365
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,792
I'm so good at flipping men,
they call me The Skillet.

366
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,190
- Oh, wow.
- Okay.

367
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,834
We need a woman, so I'll go.

368
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,317
What? You, Detective?
Socialize and flirt? Come on.

369
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,479
Yeah, but for the investigation,
I can sacrifice.

370
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,195
Can't be that hard
being frivolous and shallow.

371
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,119
I'll just channel
my inner Lucifer.

372
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,118
What, you want to become
a female version of me?

373
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,511
Okay.

374
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,830
I'll gladly train you.

375
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,191
Chloe does Lucifer?

376
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,720
I wouldn't exactly word it
that way...

377
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,196
Get ready to go
full me, Detective.

378
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,072
Oh, the Paris shows
were glorious.

379
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,475
Yes, worth the jetlag alone.

380
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,636
How was <i>your</i> weekend?

381
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,399
Uh, awesome. Great.

382
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,796
Uh, Saturday,
went camping with my daughter.

383
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,196
And, uh, Sunday,
did a big Costco run.

384
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,359
There's, like,
300 hot dogs in my freezer.

385
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,234
Oh, really?
That is so interest...

386
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,472
Oh, dear. Look what you did
to poor Giancarlo.

387
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,194
Dead from boredom.

388
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,278
Now, look, you're going
to this Top Meet mixer

389
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,311
to hunt down a killer,

390
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,876
not to talk about your hunt
for bulk food bargains.

391
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,758
Okay.

392
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,555
Sorry I'm not fancy-schmancy
enough for Giancarlo.

393
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,870
Okay, let's get
the terminology straight.

394
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,440
Not "fancy-schmancy."

395
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,352
Sophisticated.

396
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,556
Oh, whatever.

397
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,713
Why don't you just
give me some tips

398
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,196
on how to blend in
with that crowd. Okay?

399
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,880
You think being
as fascinating as I am

400
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,112
can be boiled down
to a few tips?

401
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,158
This is not paint by numbers.

402
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,439
Goodness me, I need a drink.

403
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,875
Oh. Thank you.

404
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,879
- I have a tip, Mom. Don't talk about me.
- Mm. Mm!

405
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,472
Yes, definitely,
no mention of the child.

406
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,431
Ugh.

407
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,756
And enough with the tips.

408
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,229
Why don't we do
a little role-play, hmm?

409
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,752
- Okay.
- You be a randy single man,

410
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,592
I'll be...

411
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,870
I'll be the new you.

412
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,596
Okay, I've never once done that.

413
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,350
My point exactly.

414
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,472
Meet Lucinda. Come on.

415
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,632
Gosh, this is gonna be
harder than I thought.

416
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,680
Oh, crap.

417
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,356
Oh.

418
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,839
Need some help there, sir?

419
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,236
There you go.

420
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,996
Good news, Ella.

421
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,552
I've been admitted to
the Forensic Shadow Program.

422
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,078
What is that?

423
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,430
A mentorship program.

424
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,074
Which means I will be
your student.

425
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,391
I am going to stick
to you like glue,

426
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,069
so I can learn how
to be good... at forensics.

427
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,955
Stuff comes up
constantly in court.

428
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,313
- That's great.
- Hold it, please!

429
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,276
Oh, I don't think so, buddy.

430
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,472
I mean, what am I,
Mother Teresa?

431
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,397
My, my.

432
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,869
Detective.

433
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,037
You look...

434
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,914
Like a female Lucifer?

435
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,395
Well, that's what
I was going for.

436
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,630
Well,

437
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,797
close enough,
but you're going to need this.

438
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,512
Do I really need to wear
an ear bug?

439
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,790
Absolutely.

440
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,831
From what we know
of our killer,

441
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,838
blue-eyed sushi snob
who loves surfing

442
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,952
and splooshing, I'd say you're
a bit out of your comfort zone,

443
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,510
so you're going to need
to bring Lucinda's A game.

444
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,551
You mean <i>your</i> A game.

445
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,160
Absolutely.
Oh, and while we're at it,

446
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,431
do you need a refresher on
"splooshing"? It's very simple.

447
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,233
- You just cover yourself in...
- No, no. Stop. I'm good, I'm good.

448
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,760
But... oh.

449
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,514
Except for...

450
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,631
What, you don't want to wear it?

451
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,836
It's not...

452
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,400
really Lucinda's style.

453
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:16,877
Right.

454
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:17,877
Oh.

455
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,556
Okay.

456
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,271
There.

457
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,077
I'm ready.

458
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,600
Yes, you are.

459
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,111
Good luck.

460
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,157
Thank you.

461
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,078
Hi. I'll get a, uh, IPA, please.

462
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,475
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

463
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,353
Not beer. Prosecco.

464
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,279
But I hate Prosecco.

465
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,716
Well, tough luck.
Lucinda loves it.

466
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,599
Beer.

467
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,950
It's a good job I'm here.

468
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,719
Yeah, man. Close call.

469
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,560
Possible suspect, moving in.

470
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,350
Right. Whatever he says to you,

471
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,791
just laugh.

472
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,832
Hey there.

473
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,597
What's your name?

474
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,837
Lucinda.

475
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,395
No, no...

476
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,671
Not like a demented witch
on crack.

477
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,758
A deep, sultry laugh.

478
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,437
Ha, ha, ha.

479
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,869
Ha... I'm sorry.

480
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,595
I think I may have had
a little too much Prosecco

481
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,275
on an empty stomach.

482
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,709
I should have
had that sushi.

483
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,474
Did you try the
sushi? Is it good?

484
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,677
No, no. I didn't.
I'm a, I'm a vegan.

485
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,757
Oh.

486
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,150
Anyway.

487
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,033
You might want to go easy
on the bubbles.

488
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,871
Ah.

489
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,071
Smooth.

490
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,874
Beginner's bad luck.

491
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,870
Look, it's hard
to do justice

492
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,759
to my captivating essence,
but she'll get the hang of it.

493
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,832
Don't be such
a Debbie Downer, Daniel.

494
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,156
Sorry.

495
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,389
- Hey.
- Hey.

496
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,990
Hi.

497
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,152
You're really tan.

498
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,840
Are you, uh, are you a surfer?

499
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,838
Well, I'd like to surf
in your eyes.

500
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,474
Ugh, dearie me.

501
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,632
He's lucky it's not a crime
to be a cheeseball.

502
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,874
Anyway, at least
the ice is broken.

503
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,719
Now, just make small talk.

504
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,560
So I drove up
to this meditation retreat

505
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,637
in Big Sur last week.

506
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,956
No, no, no!

507
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,389
PCH is closed.

508
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,192
Say you helicoptered...

509
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,078
Shush.

510
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,800
Uh, excuse me?

511
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,992
Sploosh. I said "sploosh."

512
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,754
Are you into splooshing?

513
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,193
Time to change tactics.

514
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,310
You know what?

515
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,877
Enjoy the Prosecco, Lucinda.

516
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,276
I don't believe this.

517
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,919
Ditching protocol mid-sting?

518
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,315
Who does that?

519
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,111
Maybe she'll do better
on her own.

520
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,675
Don't be ridiculous, Daniel.

521
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,752
She'll flounder
without my expert guidance.

522
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,791
- Oh, yeah.
- Right.

523
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,229
I'm clearly needed
on the front lines.

524
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,557
You just stay here
and do what you do best.

525
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,990
Nada.

526
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,310
Oh, I love traveling.

527
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,755
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

528
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,917
Any fun plans coming up?

529
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,471
Um, well, I...

530
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,400
I was thinking of, uh,
maybe getting out of the city

531
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,956
and taking my
daughter camping.

532
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,077
Cool.

533
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,396
I-I love the outdoors.

534
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,671
- Oh.
- I'm a surfer.

535
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,798
Really?

536
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,840
Goes well with camping.

537
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,633
I've always wanted
to try surfing.

538
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,796
- But I...
- You should...

539
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,916
Oh, hi, Lucifer.

540
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,076
This is Benji.

541
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,518
He just had

542
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,995
four pieces of sashimi,

543
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,520
and we just started
talking about surfing.

544
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,439
Oh, lovely. Now, I insist

545
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,040
you put your mic back in
immediately.

546
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,316
We can't hear a thing
in the truck.

547
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,159
You are being quite loud.

548
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,830
Nice work.

549
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,109
Bloody hell.

550
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,120
Hey, there goes Benji!

551
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,754
Benji, over here!

552
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,353
Whoa.
You have to save me from them.

553
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,716
Uh, yeah.

554
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,350
They're with me.

555
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,355
Not bad for nada, huh?

556
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,516
Wait, she's a cop?

557
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,029
Detective Decker, LAPD.

558
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,794
We want to talk to you
about a murder.

559
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,440
Benji, you're the best, bro!

560
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,597
You're not paparazzi?

561
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,438
What?

562
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,795
Oh, thank God.

563
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,834
I mean, the things
Dad gets credit for.

564
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,270
Yeah, I went on a date with her.

565
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,636
Just the other night.

566
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,874
Still can't believe she's, uh...
she's dead.

567
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,391
Oh?

568
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,717
Did you think she'd survive
you murdering her?

569
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,400
I told you, I'm innocent.

570
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,556
Well, you're an overpaid DJ,

571
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,160
so that's up for debate.

572
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,798
It seems you were the last
person to see Kim alive.

573
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,637
I couldn't have been.

574
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,076
When I dropped her off
after our date,

575
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,316
her roommate was still there.

576
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,671
How do you know that?

577
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,155
Because that's the reason
I didn't go upstairs

578
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,589
like Kim suggested.

579
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,036
I was trying to avoid Esther.

580
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,833
What, kombucha martini girl?

581
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,751
Do you know her roommate?

582
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,314
To the extent
that you can know someone

583
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,392
who's glued to her phone
and talks in hashtags.

584
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,920
Yep, that's her.

585
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,156
How did you two meet?

586
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,080
We matched on the Top Meet app
a few weeks ago.

587
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,000
Went on two exhausting dates.

588
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,594
Then why go on the second date?

589
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,714
Because I wanted
to see Kim again.

590
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,159
I met her at the apartment
when I picked up Esther

591
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,510
for our first date.

592
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,554
She wasn't there
the second time.

593
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,955
So you can imagine
how stoked I was

594
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,310
when she popped up
on the Top Meet app.

595
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,158
No.

596
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,157
I can't, actually.

597
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,273
You're saying that you used
a top hat to get to a shoe?

598
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,836
He must be lying, Detective.

599
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,269
I'm not lying.

600
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,469
I really liked Kim.

601
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,953
She was different than all
the other women on the app.

602
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,435
What, different as in duller,

603
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,200
more mundane
and dressed for less?

604
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,279
No, as in she
didn't make me feel

605
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,398
like I had to be on
all the time.

606
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,791
With her, I could...

607
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,555
I could just be myself.

608
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,436
Interesting.

609
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,351
Thanks.

610
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,557
What if Esther found out
about Benji and Kim?

611
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,120
Got jealous,
lost control...

612
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,160
This goddess,
jealous of the plain Jane?

613
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,316
It's-it's ludicrous!

614
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,910
It's like me being jealous
of that paper clip.

615
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,911
Or Daniel.

616
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,195
I mean, not to mention

617
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,875
Esther is far too busy
for murder, Detective.

618
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,833
Look. She flew
to Florence last week

619
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,520
just 'cause she fancied
eating some gelato.

620
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,949
She went on a plane
to get ice cream?

621
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,072
Well, when you say it in
English, it sounds silly.

622
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,916
Oh. Hello.
Look at that belfie.

623
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,874
Bet you could bounce
a quarter off that derrière.

624
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,874
Oh. Yeah...

625
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,594
Wait, uh, go back.

626
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,550
- There.
- What?

627
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,549
Something small and compact

628
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,240
and surprisingly heavy
for its size.

629
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,874
Well, what's Miss Lopez's
Aunt Rosalita

630
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,236
got to do with anything?

631
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,638
Look.

632
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,592
The dumbbell.

633
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,194
It wasn't at the crime scene.

634
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,959
It matches the bruises
on the victim,

635
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,350
it's a weapon
of convenience,

636
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,233
and it fits the crime of passion
scenario.

637
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,836
Doesn't mean Esther was
the one to wield it, though.

638
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,872
If my theory of jealousy
is right, she was.

639
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,316
Trust me, Detective,

640
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,392
there's no way that Esther
has ever used a weight...

641
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,200
I refer once again to her
naturally sublime derrière.

642
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,354
Oh, crap.

643
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,560
You're avoiding me, aren't you?

644
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,790
Don't be crazy.

645
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,199
No. I just...

646
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,117
you know,
like my floors spotless.

647
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,274
An evidence lab can
never be too clean.

648
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,677
And that is your Forensic
Lesson of the Day.

649
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,876
More next week?

650
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,958
Why don't you want to mentor me?

651
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,439
It's not that
I don't want to, okay?

652
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,710
I just don't have the time.

653
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,717
Well, I've been watching you.

654
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,671
You have plenty of time.

655
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,633
You just waste it chitchatting.

656
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,832
You mean socializing?

657
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,672
Connecting with people
isn't a waste.

658
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,351
Okay.

659
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,274
Let's be honest here.

660
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,236
You don't really care about
anyone's kids or whatever.

661
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,672
I mean, you're faking it, right?

662
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,595
Just tell me, how do you keep
your eyes from glazing over?

663
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,197
There is no Forensic Shadow
Program, is there?

664
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,671
Even if I had been
tempted to help...

665
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,712
and I'm not saying
that I had...

666
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,673
now that I know you lied?

667
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,477
Poof!

668
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,475
Temptation officially gone.

669
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,317
Okay, so I'm thinking:
big band over here

670
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,911
and two long, two long
buffet tables over here...

671
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,110
or should we do three?

672
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,114
Well, it depends. How
many people are coming?

673
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,390
Uh, just 350.

674
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,756
350?

675
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,677
Wow.

676
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,559
I didn't realize how much
you still cared about Reese.

677
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,477
Of course I do!

678
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,955
I'm heartbroken about his death.

679
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,074
Distraught, really.

680
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,476
Can barely function.

681
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,876
Okay, okay.

682
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,478
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
I'm functioning perfectly.

683
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,631
I only feel terrible

684
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,718
that I <i>don't</i> feel terrible
about his death.

685
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,072
Okay, so all of this
is just a...

686
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,634
A pathetic attempt
to cover up the fact

687
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,436
that I can't stop thinking
about me.

688
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,075
Me, me.

689
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,757
Me and my own brush with death.

690
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,872
- I understand, Linda. I mean...
- How could you possibly understand

691
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,554
what it's like to be rotisseried

692
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,996
by the, by the goddess
of all creation?

693
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,272
Dealing with mortality
was so much easier

694
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,115
when I was just another
clueless idiot.

695
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:16,437
Being a celestial insider...
really sucks.

696
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,160
I used to walk
around thinking

697
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,392
maybe reincarnation <i>was</i> real.

698
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,997
Sure, it sounded bonkers,

699
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,790
but I could still wonder,
still hope.

700
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,075
What if I came back
as a chameleon or something?

701
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,280
Chameleons are cool.

702
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,395
But now I know
that's never happening,

703
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,150
because I know,
you know, everything,

704
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,958
including where I'm headed
when... when this is over.

705
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,471
And where is that?

706
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,716
Where do you think?

707
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,159
I wish I'd never met any of you.

708
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,196
So we wanted
to, uh, ask you

709
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,038
a few...

710
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,799
Would you want
to put on a shirt,

711
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,232
or anything to cover...
your body?

712
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,239
No. Why? Are you cold?

713
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,709
Yes. Would you like
my jacket, Detective?

714
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,030
No. I am great, thank you.

715
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,192
Right.

716
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,598
So, when was this photo taken?

717
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:29,355
Uh, I took that on my way
to Tokyo, I think.

718
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,757
Sorry.

719
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,758
I travel so much,
it's hard to keep track.

720
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,314
It's actually
something else

721
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,789
that we're trying to track down.

722
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,911
This pink dumbbell here?

723
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,634
It went missing
the night of Kim's murder.

724
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,791
Any idea where it went?

725
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,592
Nope.

726
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,951
It's not mine.
I don't work out.

727
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,515
- Ah.
- Everything you see

728
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,439
- is God-given.
- And they say that

729
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,869
Dad doesn't give
with both hands.

730
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,315
So, the dumbbell.

731
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,477
You're saying that's Kim's?

732
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,750
Yeah. Poor thing

733
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,832
tried so hard to be like me.

734
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,355
So how did it feel
when you realized

735
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,994
that Benji preferred Kim to you?

736
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,953
Nuh, uh-uh-uh. Sneaky.

737
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,040
Don't listen
to the detective, darling.

738
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,196
She's trying
to trick you.

739
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,231
You just look
into my eyes

740
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,079
so we can prove to her
that she's wrong.

741
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,720
Now, you're too sophisticated

742
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,230
to care about your boring
flatmate's trifles, aren't you?

743
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,194
Tell me, what is it
that you really desire?

744
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,671
I...

745
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,876
I...

746
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:20,877
Yeah.

747
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,275
...want to...

748
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,995
stop posing and lying!

749
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,319
It takes so much effort

750
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,512
to make these pics look
so effortless.

751
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,631
It's exhausting!

752
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,036
Well, so you're saying
it's just all a facade?

753
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,552
I don't even know
what that word means!

754
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,558
I'm not worldly at all!

755
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,237
# Barbados?

756
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,917
More like
# Bogus.

757
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,236
The most exotic place

758
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,999
I've ever been
is the gym's sauna.

759
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,839
But you said
you didn't work out.

760
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,874
Of course I do.

761
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,117
With real equipment,
at a gym,

762
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,755
not in my living room.

763
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,917
So you're still saying
that the dumbbell is Kim's?

764
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:04,319
Yeah. She tried everything to be
part of my glamorous lifestyle.

765
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,119
She was even planning
on getting surgery

766
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,555
once all the money came in.

767
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,757
What money?

768
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,797
I don't know,

769
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,912
but she made it sound
life-changing.

770
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,111
<i>Maybe the motive</i>

771
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,674
for Kim's murder
was financial.

772
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,951
Maybe she was coming
into some inheritance,

773
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,674
and someone wasn't
happy about it.

774
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,758
I can't believe
Esther was a fake.

775
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,639
I mean, how did I
completely misjudge her?

776
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,950
Lucifer, are you listening?

777
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,435
We need to look
into this windfall.

778
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,995
Detective, I think

779
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,190
I've been spending too
much time with you.

780
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,596
It's turned my
top hat radar rusty.

781
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,393
- What?
- But no offense, but I think I need

782
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,960
to go and hang out with
some interesting people

783
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,879
before you turn
me into a shoe.

784
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,600
- I'm sorry.
- Mm.

785
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,120
I don't regret meeting you.

786
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,671
I just...
It's a lot.

787
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,312
I've calmed down now,
so can we go?

788
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,360
Lie down with me, Linda.

789
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,870
On the... on the sand?

790
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,871
Oh, okay.

791
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,316
Listen,

792
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:16,230
there was a time when I, too,
thought that I knew everything.

793
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,472
This was... this was back
when I was an angel

794
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,075
and spent all my time
looking down on the world.

795
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,317
But, you see, I found

796
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,193
that it takes looking up
to gain perspective.

797
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,959
It's a good reminder
of just how much

798
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,714
there is that we don't know.

799
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,036
Linda...

800
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,999
if you really
think about it...

801
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,190
do you have any fewer
questions than you used to?

802
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,310
When you didn't know?

803
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,716
I mean, they're...
they're different questions,

804
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,713
but there are just
as many, maybe more.

805
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,751
So you're still every bit

806
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,872
the clueless idiot
that you always were?

807
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,560
That helps.

808
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,073
Still sucks about
the chameleon, though.

809
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,874
Thank you.

810
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,991
I can't find any sign
of that windfall.

811
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,550
As far as I can tell, there was
no money coming Kim's way.

812
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,029
Oh, there's got
to be something.

813
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,196
There is.

814
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,760
Charlotte,
what are you doing here?

815
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,155
I felt unsettled
about lying to you.

816
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,795
Um, I thought I could make up
for it by making myself useful.

817
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,472
So, I overheard you talking
about finding a connection

818
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,478
between the dead girl
and that exclusive dating app.

819
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,433
So I did a little digging,
and I found one...

820
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,632
- Well, we're long past that.
- Are you sure?

821
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,399
I had to pull some strings
to get this.

822
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,432
It's an employment
contract

823
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,438
between Kim
and the owner of the app,

824
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,676
Mack something.

825
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,436
Drawn up two years ago
in total secrecy.

826
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,196
But Mack said
that he hadn't met Kim

827
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,311
until she called him that night.

828
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,590
Oh, he met her, all right.

829
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,035
Kim <i>hired</i> him.

830
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,600
She hired <i>him?</i>

831
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,833
And then hacked his app?
It doesn't make sense.

832
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,030
Unless...

833
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,790
she didn't hack it.

834
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,597
Top Meet's encryption protocol
is impossible to crack.

835
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,479
Except to the person
who built it.

836
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,358
Exactly.

837
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,518
So, if Kim created Top Meet,

838
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,916
then who the hell is Mack?

839
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,760
Well, no computer whiz,
that's for sure.

840
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,711
C-minus student,

841
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,400
barely graduated
high school.

842
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,430
Voted Most Likely
to Sleep His Way to the Top.

843
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,552
And guess what he was
doing before Top Meet.

844
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,995
Spin instructor.

845
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,754
Okay, wh-why would Kim
hire him, though,

846
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,117
if she's this genius
computer engineer?

847
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,800
What does he bring
to the equation?

848
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,633
Uh... <i>that.</i>

849
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,395
Look at him
and then look at her.

850
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,829
If both came to you

851
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,838
asking for funding for
an elite dating app,

852
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,190
whose project
would you invest in?

853
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,790
Well, yeah, if you're being
all superfish and whatevs.

854
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,229
Which many people are.

855
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,399
Maybe Kim felt she wasn't
fancy-schmancy enough,

856
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,677
so she hid the fact
that she was the creator,

857
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,475
and hired pretty boy Mack here
to be the facade.

858
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,990
In secret. Explains
why it didn't come up

859
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,157
- in the background check.
- So Kim's insecurities

860
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,595
allowed Mack to take the credit.

861
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,110
And the money.

862
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,199
Which she wanted
to take back.

863
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,834
That's the windfall
she was expecting.

864
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,429
It's a strong motive
for him to kill her.

865
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,120
- Yeah, but didn't his alibi check out?
- He could have

866
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,710
easily convinced one of his
employees to lie for him.

867
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,674
It's a solid theory,
but still,

868
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,076
it's just a theory... we need proof.

869
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,600
I really wish we had
that murderous dumbbell

870
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,274
- right about now.
- Well, if Mack did it,

871
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,915
- I think we know where to find it.
- Hmm? We do?

872
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,312
Uh, there's a good chance

873
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,159
the murder weapon
is at Mack's place.

874
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,272
Seasoned killers know
to leave it at the scene,

875
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,790
but first-timers,
they tend to take it with them.

876
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,198
I can't count the times I've
allegedly helped a client unmake

877
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,629
that mistake.

878
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,396
Really?

879
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,080
What? I said "allegedly."

880
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,751
We need to get a search warrant
for Mack's place.

881
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,997
- Yeah, good luck with that.
- Excuse me?

882
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,397
Mack's lawyer will argue
that all you have is conjecture

883
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,875
based on circumstantial
evidence,

884
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,315
and any judge will agree.

885
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,240
You're never getting
that warrant.

886
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,320
Well, then it's a good thing
I am <i>exactly</i> our killer's type.

887
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,955
Mack! I <i>love</i> the place.

888
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,310
Mr. Morningstar.

889
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,314
How about
a gentlemen's weekend in Vegas?

890
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,751
I need to scrape the rust
off my playboy ways, and you're

891
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,030
just the chap to help this Devil

892
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,390
get his groove back.
What do you say?

893
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,199
That sounds fun.

894
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,516
- Yeah.
- Uh...

895
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,198
but I'm afraid I have
a previous engagement.

896
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,317
Oh?

897
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,751
Some alone time
with the detective?

898
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,191
- Not alone anymore.
- Oh, Mack.

899
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,595
I suppose we all have
our low points.

900
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,677
But not to worry,

901
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,519
I've got a chopper waiting...
if we leave now,

902
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,074
we can still make the
Encore pool party.

903
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,317
I'm afraid
you're gonna have to leave,

904
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,516
Detective... I'm
trying to kick off

905
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,632
a Most Interesting
Bachelors' Bacchanalian here.

906
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,553
You leave. I'm having fun.

907
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,393
Something going on
between you two?

908
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,313
- Absolutely not.
- Absolutely not.

909
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,996
I'm gonna grab a beer.

910
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,676
Decide for yourselves who gets
the pleasure of my company.

911
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,951
Okay.

912
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,480
Well, I didn't have him
pegged for your type.

913
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,670
I thought you
preferred them boring.

914
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,950
You think I'm on a date?

915
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,112
I am here looking
for the murder weapon, Lucifer.

916
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,993
What, so now you think
Mack's the killer?

917
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,994
You're just profiling
fabulous people, aren't you?

918
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,192
Enough with this crusade
against us already.

919
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,754
Mack isn't fabulous.

920
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,229
Kim created Top Meet.

921
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,590
He stole it.

922
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:30,912
What?

923
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,719
- Another phony?
- Yes.

924
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,357
I suppose that explains the
self-aggrandizing artwork.

925
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,311
Would you just help me

926
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,237
find the weapon?

927
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,760
Please?

928
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,112
Okay, fine, in my experience,
it's, uh, usually in the toilet.

929
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:46,992
Oh, I checked there.

930
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,000
Uh... freezer?

931
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,157
It's not there, either.

932
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,556
Well, the fireplace, then.

933
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,440
Oh, Lucifer.

934
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,551
There's no way.

935
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,477
I mean,

936
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,160
could he really be
dumb enough to...

937
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,834
to...

938
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,791
Lucifer.

939
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,991
Wha...

940
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,478
Ah.

941
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,393
Well, I think you put
the dumb into dumbbell.

942
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,194
Decided against the beer...

943
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,636
two cops showing up
at my house on the same day.

944
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,960
Uh, figured that
must not be a coincidence.

945
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,356
Still think I'm dumb?

946
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,911
Basic deduction
doesn't make you a genius, Mack.

947
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,270
But then again,
you're used to taking

948
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,470
more credit than you deserve.

949
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,832
Yes, Mack...
or should I say... Hack?

950
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,155
Waste of a pun. You're
gonna have to spell it out

951
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,316
for him, Detective.

952
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,438
We know that Kim
created Top Meet.

953
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,360
Oh, yeah? You know she was
also gonna destroy it, too?

954
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,673
She sneaks onto the site,
goes on one good date,

955
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,951
and then wants to make the app
more accessible.

956
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,471
So stupid!

957
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,797
What's stupid
about thinking someone deserves

958
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,832
to be loved
for who they really are?

959
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,594
Kim was the
brains, Mack.

960
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,429
You were just the face.

961
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,234
<i>Just</i> the face?

962
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,839
Kim was Wozniak. I'm Jobs.

963
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,753
No one gives a crap
about Wozniak.

964
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,357
Oh, please, Mack.
What you are is a fraud.

965
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,399
Which, unfortunately,
makes you boring.

966
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,233
And predictable. Watch.

967
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,111
- Put that down.
- Or what?

968
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,277
You're gonna blow your own face
to smithereens, Mack?

969
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,039
It's quite heavy,
isn't it? At least

970
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,230
they got the density right.

971
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,078
Ooh!

972
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,350
Heads up!

973
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,595
Nice catch.

974
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,120
Today interesting
enough for you?

975
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,959
Well, beats Monopoly.

976
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,756
<i>But in the end,</i>

977
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,434
the shoe turned out
to be interesting,

978
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,393
and the top hat, boring.

979
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:47,038
Right. So you're gonna
embrace your boring side now?

980
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,038
Well, I would,
but I have no boring side.

981
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,471
- Ah.
- Even the most trivial of nights takes a turn

982
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,074
for the exciting
when I'm involved.

983
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,033
I just got to throw
a man's own head at him.

984
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,790
That sounds... painful.

985
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,832
Oh, don't worry,
he deserved it...

986
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,953
for pretending to be
something he wasn't.

987
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,551
I mean, people really do waste
an awful lot of time

988
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,591
trying to be interesting.

989
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:09,758
People.

990
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,996
Not you, though.

991
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,232
Oh, no. To me,
it just comes effortlessly.

992
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,790
All I have to do
is just be myself.

993
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:16,992
Hmm.

994
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,554
Mm.

995
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,792
But what I really want
to know is,

996
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,710
how have <i>you</i> been doing?

997
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,350
Well...

998
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,391
I was in a really dark place.

999
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,276
But...

1000
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,679
someone helped me
gain perspective.

1001
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,359
How's that saying go?

1002
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,600
We're all in the gutter,

1003
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,632
but some of us are
looking up at the stars.

1004
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,354
The stars are just gas bags,

1005
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,960
and I never would have
fed Oscar that line

1006
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,800
had I known how much I'd have to
hear people quote it back to me.

1007
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,509
Oscar freakin' Wilde?

1008
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,393
- Mm-hmm.
- Really?

1009
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,512
Now, he <i>was</i> an interesting bachelor.

1010
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,310
Anyway, I'm glad to hear
that you are doing better.

1011
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,994
This calls
for a celebration.

1012
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,670
So...

1013
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,280
Oscar, huh?

1014
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,276
Mm.

1015
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,477
- Tell me everything.
- Well...

1016
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,439
he was straight
when I first met him.

1017
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:17,877
Oh, God!

1018
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,716
That one was all you.

1019
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,354
I was about to knock.

1020
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,393
There's...
something I need to tell you.

1021
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,036
Funny.

1022
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,395
There's actually something
I need to tell you, too.

1023
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,036
Thank you.

1024
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,673
That contract helped put
a killer behind bars.

1025
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,317
You did a good thing.

1026
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,516
I stole it.

1027
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,029
Aw, man.

1028
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,596
Seriously?

1029
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,036
You know what?

1030
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,874
It still counts, okay?

1031
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,673
You did a bad thing.

1032
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,552
But it was for
a good reason.

1033
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,711
- Really?
- Yes.

1034
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,957
But only if,
in good faith,

1035
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,312
you try to do it
the right way first.

1036
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,512
Being good
takes practice.

1037
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,832
Okay? So just keep at it,

1038
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,997
and you'll get better.

1039
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,311
I guess I should take
that job, then.

1040
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,276
What job?

1041
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,595
I've been offered a position
in the D.A.'s office to...

1042
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,315
help put criminals away
for a change.

1043
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,512
Yeah, but like you would
ever take that pay cut.

1044
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,995
Yeah, I know.

1045
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,711
But anyway,

1046
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,792
um, sometimes there's
more important things...

1047
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:28,957
than money.

1048
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,995
Oh, yeah. Yeah, like
all the things money can buy.

1049
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,795
Too late...
you talked me into it.

1050
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,277
I did?

1051
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,279
Yes. This job is
the perfect place...

1052
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,196
to practice
this "being good" thing.

1053
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,837
And bonus.

1054
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,559
I'll be around here more.

1055
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,755
Yeah.

1056
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,240
Bonus.

1057
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,793
So, how did
Lucinda do, Mom?

1058
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,276
Uh, she did... okay.

1059
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,677
Helped us catch the
bad guy in the end.

1060
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,793
- Thank you.
- No, I meant...

1061
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,317
how did meeting new people
at the party go?

1062
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,670
Oh.

1063
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,194
Well, um...

1064
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,199
I actually...
had a pretty good time.

1065
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,118
I mean, but only once I...
stopped being Lucinda

1066
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,397
and started being myself.

1067
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,880
You know, it can be scary
sometimes, but...

1068
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,237
being who you really are
is never a bad idea.

1069
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,354
Hey, there's a piece missing.

1070
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,510
Lucifer.

1071
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,432
Are you coming?

1072
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,835
Uh...

1073
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,117
how about a nice
round of Monopoly?

1074
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,471
No?

1075
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,952
Little face-
painting, maybe?

1076
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,675
I didn't think so.

1077
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:05,996
Hmm.
