1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,079
<i>- Previously on</i> Lucifer...
- We need to figure out who kidnapped me.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,800
I'm fairly certain that
my Father's behind it.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,116
<i>Lucifer,
I'm not angry with you,</i>

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,079
<i>that you somehow
got your wings back,</i>

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,879
<i>or even that
you cut them off again.</i>

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,753
<i>I was tested once,
and I failed.</i>

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,996
I'm not gonna fail again.

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,799
I suppose this won't bother you.

9
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,716
But you cut them off.

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,990
The pesky things seem to be

11
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,038
a bit more tenacious
this time around.

12
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,310
I'm Lieutenant Marcus Pierce.

13
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,840
Heard a lot about
you, Lieutenant,

14
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,560
and I'm really excited
to work with you.

15
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,353
Aren't you that corrupt
cop that got off easy?

16
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,431
Excuse me?

17
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,676
People come to me
to ask for favors,

18
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,798
and more often than not,
I'm happy to oblige.

19
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:32,837
What do you get?

20
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,912
Simply to be repaid
at a later date.

21
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,873
A devilish IOU, if you will.

22
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,636
<i>Who's the Sinnerman?</i>

23
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,559
That's who hired me
to kidnap you.

24
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,070
He's a scary dude.
Huge crime boss.

25
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,270
And where do I find him?

26
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,910
<i>You don't. He finds you.</i>

27
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,317
This way.

28
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,035
Ah...

29
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,311
You're an angel.

30
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,314
Oh, gosh.

31
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,880
Uh, my apologies.

32
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,719
And for the record,
I don't usually suffer

33
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,798
from premature unfurling.

34
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,477
Right.
Now, where were we?

35
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,637
No, keep them out.

36
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,237
I'm totally into cosplay.

37
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,152
I could dress up as a devil
and make it really sexy.

38
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,353
I have no desire
to have sex with myself.

39
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,279
Not right now, at least.

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,110
Where are you going?

41
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,080
To do some grooming.

42
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,198
I'd recommend you leave. Now.

43
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,713
I'm about to engage
in a rather gruesome form

44
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,876
of manscaping.

45
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,680
<i>You cut them off, didn't you?</i>

46
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,317
I did, yes.

47
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,677
But then they grew back,
so I cut them off again.

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,150
It's like whack-a-mole
back there.

49
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,396
I'm worried about you.

50
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,710
What you're describing
is self-mutilation.

51
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,594
Doctor, someone is
forcing those wings on me.

52
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,280
They took away my devil face.

53
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,995
And I won't stand for someone
making me something I'm not.

54
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,952
Are you any closer to
finding out who did this?

55
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,880
Yes. Well, a little.

56
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,599
He calls himself
"The Sinnerman."

57
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,837
From what I can gather,

58
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,396
he's a criminal mastermind
who just moved his operation

59
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,035
to Los Angeles, but no one
seems to have ever met him,

60
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,835
which makes punching him in the
face frustratingly difficult.

61
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,111
Well, maybe...

62
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,358
Doctor,

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,673
are you sure you're all right
to be back at work?

64
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,870
I mean, it really
hasn't been that long

65
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,957
since Mum flambÃ©ed you.

66
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,958
Yes. It certainly was a...

67
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,350
traumatic experience.

68
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,119
Fortunately, I'm trained to deal
with that sort of thing,

69
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,760
and I'm doing just that.

70
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,872
And there's nothing
I can do to help?

71
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,952
Yes. You can let me
get back to you.

72
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,234
Oh, if you insist.

73
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,074
Oh, I haven't even told you
the worst part, have I?

74
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,760
Not only did he stick
my wings back on

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,390
and take my face,
he's stolen my shtick as well.

76
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,960
He gives out favors to people

77
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,640
for a price to be named later.

78
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,231
Sound familiar?

79
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,433
Lucifer, you didn't invent
the idea of giving out favors.

80
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,996
Yep,
forgot who I was talking to.

81
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,719
I suppose you did.

82
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,877
But you haven't given
out favors in a while.

83
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,276
And the Sinnerman knows it.

84
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,154
I think he's
taunting me.

85
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,834
Do you think he's human?

86
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,156
Or something else?

87
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,915
I don't know.

88
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,353
But whatever he is, I'm gonna
stop at nothing to find him.

89
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,518
We found him.

90
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,598
Who? The missing link?

91
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,678
Proof of human-rodent
copulation.

92
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,952
It's Mike Alonso.

93
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,753
The guy that skewered your
kidnapper under the pier.

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,310
This is clearly
not the Sinnerman.

95
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,318
Clearly not,
since I'm pretty sure

96
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,791
that no one with that name
actually exists.

97
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,072
He had motive, no alibi,

98
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,153
and, oh, yeah,
he confessed

99
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,079
under interrogation.
He's our guy.

100
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,112
Well, then he must be
working for the Sinnerman.

101
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,311
You're not gonna drag me

102
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,517
into whatever new
weird drama this is.

103
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,677
And could you please

104
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,360
stop saying "Sinnerman"?

105
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,671
Sinnerman.

106
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,356
Big Nina Simone fan?

107
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,789
Well, actually, I am.
But I was just saying - What? Nothing.

108
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,036
- to the detective...
- Nothing. It's nothing.

109
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,954
Are you hiding something
from me, Detective?

110
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,797
No.

111
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,709
I don't care;
I was just asking.

112
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,509
New case came in,
you're up.

113
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,077
Thank you.

114
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,316
Okay. Why did you just stop me
telling the new lieutenant

115
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,193
we're on the cusp of the
greatest case of our lives?

116
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,512
Because the Sinnerman is an
urban myth; he doesn't exist.

117
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,712
He's a boogeyman
that criminals use

118
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,751
to hide their bad behavior.

119
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,280
"Oh, the Sinnerman
made me do it."

120
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,914
Yet another thing
he's stolen from me,

121
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,032
being blamed for
the bad deeds of men.

122
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,994
- He can keep that one, actually.
- So the idea

123
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,153
of telling our new boss...

124
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,233
who I'm just starting
to get a rhythm with...

125
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,392
that you want to arrest
the Easter Bunny

126
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,920
doesn't really thrill me.

127
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,600
I have no intention
of arresting anyone.

128
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,029
I want to grab him by his
neck and see what happens

129
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,430
when I squeeze hard enough.

130
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,350
If you can bring me
any tiny bit of evidence

131
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,517
that the Sinnerman
actually exists,

132
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,279
I will be the first
to look into it.

133
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,397
But...

134
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,072
until then,
consider this case closed.

135
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,357
And let's focus
on this case, please.

136
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,557
Okay.

137
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,553
Daniel?

138
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,592
Guy's name
is JD Woodstock.

139
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,677
He lived right
around the corner.

140
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,200
Neighbors said he
was pretty quiet.

141
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,914
Unemployed, but we
found this on him.

142
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,712
Huh.

143
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,476
So what are these? Jokes?

144
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,552
A charitable description,
Detective.

145
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,792
"Avocado?

146
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,593
How about avoca-don't?"

147
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,632
Would it be rude
to throw tomatoes at a corpse?

148
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,194
Looks like he was
a struggling comedian.

149
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,153
We're trying to figure out
if he performed anywhere.

150
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,840
What'd he do? Make
fun of the wrong person?

151
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,110
Get in a fight with
an audience member?

152
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,675
It's worth exploring,
at least.

153
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,559
You know, there are a lot
of insult comics out there,

154
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,513
and not everybody
enjoys being mocked.

155
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,074
Hmm. We should listen
to Daniel, actually.

156
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,674
He's got a unique
insight into this case.

157
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,437
What's he talking about?

158
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,835
Well, they're
kindred spirits.

159
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,360
A fellow broken
soul who puts

160
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,119
the most embarrassing parts
of his life on display

161
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,760
for his audience
for an easy laugh.

162
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,799
He does stand-up;
I do improv.

163
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,030
They're completely
different things.

164
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,071
- Oh.
- Improv

165
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,634
is all about "yes, and."

166
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,200
Stand-up, well, that's about
telling jokes...

167
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,993
I-I regret starting
this entire conversation.

168
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,157
Wait. Excuse me, Dan.

169
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,476
You do improv?

170
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,959
How did I not know that?
And how did he?

171
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,230
- Well, it's a funny story, actually.
- Actually,

172
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,432
it's because I-I don't
tell a lot of people.

173
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,637
Why?

174
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,876
Yeah... hey, Ella.

175
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,796
How's it going?
What'd you find?

176
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,879
Well, no murder weapon, but I
did find three shell casings.

177
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,560
Running ballistics
on them now.

178
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,431
But, based on the
firing pattern,

179
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,711
I think this dude was tortured
before he finally died.

180
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,191
Oh, well congratulations,
Mr. Woodstock.

181
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,993
At least someone cared enough
about your jokes to...

182
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,276
Did you just
say Woodstock?

183
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,950
As in, JD Woodstock?

184
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,151
Yeah. Why?
You know him?

185
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,680
Yeah. He made big news
a couple days ago,

186
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,553
claiming Bobby Lowe
stole his jokes.

187
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,558
And who is Bobby Lowe?
A rival comedian

188
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,717
who hates himself so much
he stole this drivel?

189
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,158
Uh, no.

190
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,755
Open your eyes, pal.

191
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,156
Yeah. JD claimed
that Bobby's show

192
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,510
was based on
his own material.

193
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,910
And that he
could prove it.

194
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,391
Which is impossible,

195
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,797
because Bobby Lowe's show
is all about his life.

196
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,912
Wait, so you're saying that
this giant-headed buffoon

197
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,793
stole our poor
victim's ideas?

198
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,356
His life's work
and built a business out of it?

199
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,631
Mm. So now he's a "poor victim."

200
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,629
Look, I know you don't
believe me, Detective,

201
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,513
but I happen to be going through
something quite similar,

202
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,989
so if I can't get
my own justice,

203
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,599
I'm gonna get it for
this poor unfunny soul.

204
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,520
Well, I certainly did want you
to focus on this case,

205
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,234
but be careful
what you wish for.

206
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,555
At least the lieutenant
isn't here.

207
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,357
You know, if you keep saying
crazy things around him,

208
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,196
who knows what he might do.

209
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,519
Right. When have I ever
cared about that, Detective?

210
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,194
Ah, that's true.

211
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,119
<i>I sweated over every joke.</i>

212
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,273
Worked my ass off for months.

213
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,314
And Bobby stole it all
like it was nothing.

214
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,953
Created a show
based on my jokes!

215
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,674
Well Bobby, guess what?

216
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,555
I finally found it.

217
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,479
Proof you're a fraud.

218
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,710
And I'm going to show it
to the world.

219
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,234
Well? Which of these boxes
do I click on for the proof?

220
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,711
None. He posted this video
the day before he died.

221
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,071
And we can't find whatever proof
he claimed to have had.

222
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,999
So that's why JD
was tortured,

223
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,873
so the killer could
find and destroy it?

224
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,833
Or he's a liar.

225
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,478
Huh?

226
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,875
I'm not sure who said that,

227
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,434
but I totally agree with them.

228
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,758
Bobby Lowe would never
do something like that.

229
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,189
- Why do you say that?
- Because,

230
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,915
Bobby's show is so personal.

231
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,957
It's so authentic.

232
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,350
There's no way that
you could fake it.

233
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,550
Right. Don't listen to her.

234
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,796
The man is
clearly a thief.

235
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,269
Let's go give him
a good throttling.

236
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,630
I'm leaning towards
just talking to him.

237
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,274
And then throttling.
I suppose a little foreplay

238
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,476
never hurt anyone.

239
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,398
Wait.

240
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,397
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You guys are gonna

241
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,398
go talk to him, like,
right now this second?

242
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,954
Yeah. Why?

243
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,355
Maybe I should go with.

244
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,319
You know, to collect
the evidence.

245
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,234
- Right. Well, if he's innocent...
- He's not innocent.

246
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,716
If he's innocent,
then there won't

247
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,240
be any evidence
to collect,

248
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,675
so probably better
if you hang here.

249
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,714
Yeah. I-I see what
you're saying there,

250
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:53,911
but...

251
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,793
I just think, to be safe,

252
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,992
I should collect
as much stuff as possible.

253
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,317
You know, fingerprints,
a lock of hair, an autograph.

254
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,237
Right.

255
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,791
To be safe.

256
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,792
Okay.

257
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,671
To be safe.

258
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,236
Yeah!

259
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,991
Hey.

260
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,551
Hey.

261
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:24,952
Yeah.

262
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,435
Thanks for meeting
me, Amenadiel.

263
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,593
Is there a shorter version
of that?

264
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,199
Does anyone ever
call you "Amen"?

265
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,917
Probably not.

266
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,349
Oh, you would be the first.

267
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,030
So, Linda,
what's going on?

268
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,992
Um, I just wanted
to say thank you.

269
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,676
For saving my life.

270
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,519
Maze is the one
who saved your life.

271
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,790
And I thanked
her so much,

272
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,360
I think she's avoiding me now.

273
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,109
But I wouldn't be here
without you, too.

274
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,837
I didn't do anything.

275
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,271
Other than miraculously
slowing down time

276
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,153
so that I didn't
bleed to death?

277
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,794
Well, other than that.

278
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,314
How are you really doing,
by the way?

279
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,711
I'm fine.

280
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,559
You have your powers back.

281
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,350
That must be exciting.

282
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,798
Mm. Um, not exactly.

283
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,519
They haven't worked
since that day.

284
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,036
I'm sorry to hear that.

285
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:24,918
Ah, don't be.

286
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,629
I think it's just my Father
testing me again.

287
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,033
But this time,
Linda, I'm ready.

288
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,436
How is He testing you?

289
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,155
Do you have to
fight someone?

290
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,718
Solve advanced
math problems?

291
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,317
Well, if I'm right,
there's something I need to do

292
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,716
in the penthouse and, uh...

293
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,909
I've been avoiding it.

294
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,955
Well, you helped me.

295
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,478
Why don't you let
me help you with...

296
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,270
whatever this is?

297
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,991
Unless it's math.

298
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,515
Oh, it's not math.

299
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,553
Then I'm sure I
can handle it.

300
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,474
Oh. Severed angel wings
in a closet.

301
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,517
Of course.

302
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,594
Totally handleable.

303
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,198
My irresponsible brother
left them here

304
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,790
for any half-drunk human
to stumble onto.

305
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,109
Proof of the divine just
left on the floor like...

306
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,832
like used laundry.

307
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,838
For some reason,
I imagined they just

308
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,238
magically disappeared
when he cut them off.

309
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,437
But this...

310
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,910
yeah, this is gruesome.

311
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,997
Mm-hmm.

312
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,195
You know where
the garbage bags are?

313
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,270
Hi, Lieutenant.

314
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,234
I just wanted to come by
and talk.

315
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,113
Kind of feel like we
got off on the wrong foot.

316
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,994
Pretty sure we're on exactly
the foot I want to be on.

317
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,355
I'm not a bad guy.

318
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,676
And I'm not a dirty cop.

319
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,280
So, you didn't check a gun
out of evidence

320
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,755
that was used to commit a crime?

321
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,280
I mean, yes.

322
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,119
At least it wasn't
a homicide, right?

323
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,070
Well, it, um...

324
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,911
- I-I was... I just...
- Stop.

325
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,476
I was gonna string
this along,

326
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,439
but it's already a
little too sad for me.

327
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,959
I'm actually glad
you came in.

328
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,915
Really?

329
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,352
I want all the intel that
you gathered on Lucifer.

330
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,074
Why would I have any
intel on Lucifer?

331
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,760
Because when he first started
working with Decker,

332
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,480
you were still
married to her.

333
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,236
And I'm guessing
you broke the rules

334
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,999
and dug up everything
you could on him.

335
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,919
I didn't. I mean...

336
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,079
Yeah. I did.

337
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,440
I'd like it all
on my desk in an hour.

338
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,680
That's the biggest cock
I've ever seen.

339
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,916
And, uh,
makeup right now.

340
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,520
Mm-hmm. Oh, whoa, whoa,
excuse me, guys.

341
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,995
- You guys can't be back here.
- We're looking for...

342
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,270
Bobby Lowe!

343
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,711
- Uh, right.
- Oh, no, no.

344
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,717
Oh, my God, please, no.

345
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,400
He doesn't like visitors.

346
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,035
Damn, I can't get fired.

347
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,078
Oh, my God, it's
really Bobby Lowe.

348
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,157
What did I say?

349
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,033
- I'm sorry.
- No eye contact,

350
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,471
no green Skittles
in my candy jar

351
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,319
and no guests!

352
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,029
I'm Detective Chloe Decker,
LAPD.

353
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,039
We want to talk to you about
the murder of JD Woodstock.

354
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,111
Why are you stopping?

355
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,993
Show starts in five minutes,
honey. Chop-chop.

356
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,792
God, he just called her honey.
So sweet.

357
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,673
Is this about that
stupid podcast?

358
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,752
You really think
I stole jokes? Me?

359
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,950
- Very much so, yes.
- Of course not.

360
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,192
What I think is I'd like

361
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,715
to explore his accusations,

362
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,400
starting with where
you were when he died.

363
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,193
You know why people

364
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,874
accuse others
of stealing material?

365
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,116
Because the others are thieves?

366
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,079
Because they're failures.

367
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,515
And instead of facing that,

368
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,757
they blame successful
people like me.

369
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,440
- How dare you...
- Uh...

370
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,676
They're ready for you, Bobby.

371
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,880
Look, some of us
have important work to do,

372
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,352
like entertaining America.

373
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,040
If you'd like to see
how it's done,

374
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,435
take a seat.

375
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,470
Charming.

376
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,074
I can't believe it.

377
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,238
He invited us to a taping.

378
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,512
Are you ready to laugh?

379
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,471
Wait, what, what?

380
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,319
No, I can't hear you guys.

381
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,317
Come on.

382
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,994
I bribed you with T-shirts.

383
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,714
I phoned in all my best jokes.

384
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,717
What more do you want?

385
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,078
Oh, yeah.

386
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,959
More T-shirts!

387
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,272
- Yeah!
- Let's try that again.

388
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,675
Look what I got.

389
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,234
Are you ready to laugh?

390
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,238
- Yeah!
- All right, guys.

391
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,471
Let's start the show.

392
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,910
Yeah!

393
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,080
Oh, there he is,
there he is.

394
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,519
Well, that was the worst date
of my entire life.

395
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,800
Oh, come on now, Bobby.

396
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,354
I'm sure it
wasn't that bad.

397
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,279
She left before
we got dessert.

398
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,240
But dessert's the
best part of the meal, Bobby.

399
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,759
Well, on the upside, you have
been trying to lose weight.

400
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,437
I didn't say I left
before dessert.

401
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,838
- This is what that arrogant fraud is so proud of?
- s h h.

402
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,960
Wait, what's this show about?

403
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,236
Oh. Those are his

404
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,715
imaginary friends.

405
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,758
They help him deal
with his insecurities.

406
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,673
- Oh.
- We've all been there, right?

407
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,479
- I'll just impress her at the party.
- Right.

408
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,477
Excuse me.

409
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,110
Excuse me.

410
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,117
Time out.

411
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,197
Excuse me.

412
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,191
Sorry.

413
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,914
You stole a dead man's work

414
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,474
and turned it into this?

415
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,030
Get lost, <i>Fraggle Rock.</i>

416
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,836
What do you think
you're doing, man?

417
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,791
Stealing your show,

418
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,798
which only seems fair
as you stole it first.

419
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,509
Hey, mind your
own business, Dr. Who.

420
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,870
Pip pip out of here.

421
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,036
Dr. Who?

422
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,310
Don't laugh.

423
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,511
Oh, geez.

424
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,315
It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

425
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,749
Right, what have you got
to say for yourself?

426
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,837
Beat it, handy.

427
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,157
I'm not talking to you.
Get the hell out of my set, man.

428
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,477
Okay. Okay, fine.
Don't talk to me.

429
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,319
Let's have a chat with one of
your old friends, shall we?

430
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,920
- What have we got in here?
- You can't touch those puppets.

431
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,270
Does anyone work here?!

432
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,632
- Ah, here we go. All right, this one looks good.
- No.

433
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,155
No, no, n-no,
put-put that...

434
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,079
- put that down.
- What? What?

435
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,954
Jealous someone else
has their hand up my butt?

436
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,877
Actually, this apparatus
is more difficult than...

437
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,559
- Seriously, put it down.
- Ah, there's the trigger.

438
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,353
- Right. Where was I?
- You...

439
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,038
I'm telling you,
just get down, get down.

440
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,357
Oh, don't worry, everyone.

441
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,392
There's just a gun
stashed inside the puppet.

442
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,831
- Lucifer, put the gun down.
- Right.

443
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,070
Right. Yes.

444
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,711
Well, at least no one was hurt.

445
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,070
Uh... he did it.

446
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,117
Are you insane? You
could've killed him.

447
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,631
Me? I'm not the one who hid
a gun up a puppet's backside.

448
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,316
Or have all the puppets
got guns in them?

449
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,351
If so, I'll set my DVR.

450
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,677
No. We never used that puppet.

451
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,599
It was my imaginary friend's
imaginary friend.

452
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,075
The character didn't land.

453
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,760
- I wonder why.
- So you hid a gun in it?

454
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,871
I didn't think some lunatic

455
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,196
was gonna try to kill me
with it.

456
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,396
It's just a flesh wound.

457
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,920
And you admit
that it's your gun?

458
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,238
Yeah.

459
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,709
Ah, I see.

460
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,957
So you killed our poor victim,
ran back to work

461
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,640
and keistered it
in an old puppet.

462
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,956
Not the murder weapon.

463
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,352
This is a.380, and the
murderer used a 9mm.

464
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,950
All that means is that he hid
his other gun somewhere else.

465
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,351
So come on. Prostate exams
for all the puppets.

466
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,631
- Lucifer...
- I don't have another gun.

467
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,480
I didn't kill JD.

468
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,797
I don't believe you.
You're a thief.

469
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,912
You took everything JD had,
even his life.

470
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,113
So come on, what more
could you possibly desire?

471
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,074
I want out of this hell.

472
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,798
Every day I come to work, and I
tell stupid jokes with puppets.

473
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,351
Puppets!

474
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,830
Bobby.

475
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,957
What are you saying?

476
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,150
This is a dream gig.

477
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,436
It's a nightmare!

478
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,036
You know what
the biggest joke is?

479
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,277
You?

480
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,119
Me!

481
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,835
It's no fun
when they talk to themselves.

482
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,314
And now that JD's dead,
I'm never getting out of here.

483
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,989
What do you mean?

484
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,316
He was telling the truth.

485
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,760
I stole his act.

486
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,114
I based the show on it.

487
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,157
But I defended you!

488
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,919
<i>J'accuse,</i> Bobby Lowe!

489
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,156
<i>J'accuse!</i>

490
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,478
If you wanted out
of the job so bad,

491
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,353
why didn't you
just admit it and quit?

492
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,880
Golden handcuffs.

493
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,078
If I quit, I lose all the money.

494
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,194
And I really like the money.

495
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,474
And if JD revealed
that you were stealing

496
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,160
his act, and they fire you...

497
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,192
I get a golden parachute
instead.

498
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,873
Which is why I had
to keep up appearances,

499
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,270
not let anyone know the truth.

500
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,472
- But why hide the gun on set?
- Yeah.

501
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,273
Because I was getting
death threats.

502
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,593
Someone's pissed, claiming
all my jokes are about him.

503
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,600
The jokes that you stole
like the thief which you are?

504
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,354
That's a big strong,
Miss Lopez.

505
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,316
Yeah.

506
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,272
Any idea who was making
these threats?

507
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,557
They came
from an anonymous e-mail.

508
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,036
But like I said,
I stole the jokes.

509
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,359
The only person who knows
who they're about...

510
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,358
Is the dead guy. Great.

511
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,435
I'm gonna need those e-mails.

512
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,440
All right.

513
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,949
God.

514
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,675
This must be so painful.

515
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,511
Cutting off a piece of
yourself over and over.

516
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,394
Lucifer made it seem
like no big deal, but...

517
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,911
ouch.

518
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,352
We all have pain
that we hide, Linda,

519
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,192
that we're just not ready
to share with the world.

520
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,109
That's very true.

521
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,352
How do you know it's a test?

522
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,559
Because I'm faced with having
to dispose of the one thing

523
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,513
that I so desperately want back.

524
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,395
- Could just be really bad luck.
- No.

525
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,239
My Father always has a plan.

526
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,960
I don't doubt that anymore.

527
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,194
Seems awfully cruel.

528
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,835
Well, if it were easy,
it wouldn't be much of a test.

529
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,432
Would it?

530
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,033
"I know what you're doing.
Stop making fun of me,

531
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,357
or else I'm going to stab you."

532
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,193
"I know you're
making fun of me.

533
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,920
Stop or I'll
kill you."

534
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,829
Dreadfully unoriginal,
aren't they?

535
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,993
Looks like the threats
stopped last week

536
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,953
after JD posted his video.

537
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,399
So you think the killer saw it
and then realized

538
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,876
he'd been threatening the
wrong comedian the entire time?

539
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,918
And then killed JD
after he realized

540
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,038
he was the guy
actually making fun of him.

541
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,391
Seems possible.

542
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,471
So...

543
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,034
what's the joke
that he's so angry about?

544
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,311
Did our killer have
unfunny imaginary friends?

545
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,838
No, that happened later.

546
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,397
I did some research,
and originally,

547
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,319
the show was
much edgier.

548
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,158
Hmm?

549
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,273
About a guy dealing with
his insecurities about his,

550
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,550
um...

551
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,435
W-Well, I really don't
want to tell you.

552
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,433
Ooh. Well, now I need to know.

553
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,833
Dealing with his insecurities
about his, um, micropenis.

554
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,320
All right, well.

555
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,680
Hold me closer, tiny donger.

556
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,553
So you're saying we're looking
for a needle in a penis stack.

557
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,513
See, this is why I
didn't want to tell you.

558
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,998
- Anyhow, after it became a family show...
- Mm.

559
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,270
...the micropenis
got removed.

560
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,675
Did anyone even notice?

561
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,200
Okay.

562
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,678
Okay.

563
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,673
Just go to town.

564
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,479
Get them all out of your system.

565
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,198
What?

566
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,476
Well, perhaps...

567
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,037
perhaps we should
consider this case closed.

568
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,310
Excuse me?

569
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,270
Well, we thought
Bobby stole a joke,

570
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,752
but in actual fact, our deceased
stole this man's very essence.

571
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,872
I mean, his tiny,
microscopic essence, sure,

572
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,594
but his essence nonetheless.

573
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,877
So, uh, in actual fact,

574
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,673
I think our killer
is the victim here.

575
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,076
Yeah, that's actually
not how it works.

576
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,800
We still need to
find our killer.

577
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,354
I'll get these to cyber,
see if they can trace an I.P.

578
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,111
What? No.

579
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,357
Not "cinnamon,"
"Sinnerman."

580
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,279
He's not a spice, Maze.

581
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,353
Well, yes, I know
you have a hectic schedule,

582
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,029
but surely you can find time
to track him down for me.

583
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,191
Right. Stop pretending
the call is cutting out, Maze.

584
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,311
I taught you that trick.

585
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,311
Maze.

586
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,150
Mazikeen!

587
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,880
Lucifer
Morningstar.

588
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,391
I've figured out
what you really are.

589
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,870
So, it's come
to this, has it?

590
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,795
Finally, someone in the police
department realized that I am

591
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,913
the Devil himself.

592
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,554
Well, I'm surprised
it's taken you this long.

593
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,677
I have no idea
why you prance around

594
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,757
and call yourself the Devil.

595
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,871
"Prance"?

596
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,960
This is about the Sinnerman.

597
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,472
Right.

598
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,511
I see what's happening here.

599
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,757
A mysterious figure
handing out favors,

600
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,076
probably dashing and handsome.

601
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,312
You think I'm the Sinnerman.

602
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,317
Well, truth is...

603
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,830
You're not the Sinnerman...
he's smart and calculated.

604
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,350
You don't know me.

605
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,116
Maybe I <i>am</i> the Sinnerman.
Surprise!

606
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,112
No, I followed you
and looked into your history.

607
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,234
You're impulsive
and short-fused.

608
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,954
I am not.

609
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,751
Very well.

610
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,633
What is it that you think I am?

611
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,077
An idiot.

612
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,597
So what, you broke into
my apartment just to insult me?

613
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,473
You could've just waited
till I was in the office.

614
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,473
No, I came here to warn you.

615
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,590
I know you're
looking into him,

616
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,672
but you have no idea
what you're doing.

617
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,354
The Sinnerman is not a myth.

618
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,994
Very aware of that already,
thank you.

619
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,839
It's not a name to throw around.

620
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,437
Not even at the precinct.

621
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,154
That's why I came
here to talk.

622
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,550
He's that dangerous.

623
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,151
So am I.

624
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,796
Maybe so.

625
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,391
Either way, you need to know
who you're dealing with.

626
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,633
I've butted heads with him
in Chicago.

627
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,876
Did not end well.

628
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,549
Then, what? You ran here with
your tail between your legs?

629
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,717
I did, yeah.

630
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,110
Oh.

631
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,080
He killed someone...
close to me.

632
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,954
Really damn close.

633
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,233
I don't want what happened to
me to happen to anyone else.

634
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,397
Even you.

635
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,676
You need to be careful.

636
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,475
He stole from me, Lieutenant,
and I won't stand for it.

637
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,478
- You're not listening.
- Yes, I am.

638
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,273
Now you listen to me.

639
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,319
You can keep your head buried
in the sand if you want to,

640
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,833
while I go mano a Sinnermano,
all right?

641
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,956
I've got this.

642
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,310
<i>So...</i>

643
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,591
Compost?

644
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,637
Recycling?

645
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,117
I've never had to dispose
of pieces of divinity before.

646
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,517
Waste.

647
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,632
I thought this would be
a little more... reverential?

648
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,992
Less angel wing
dumpster fire.

649
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,600
Should we say something?

650
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,435
I feel like we should
say something...

651
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,518
What do you want me
to say here, Linda?

652
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,360
I didn't choose this test.

653
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,756
I don't even know if
this really is a test.

654
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,389
I mean, maybe I'm just
torturing myself here.

655
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,039
But if Lucifer wants to treat
his wings like trash,

656
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,995
then trash they shall be.
Even if it pains me

657
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,350
in my very soul.

658
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,760
I don't think Lucifer knows
how much this hurts you.

659
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,800
He never does.

660
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,680
And even though he
doesn't realize it,

661
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,510
everything he does seems
designed to hurt me.

662
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,550
To test you?

663
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,794
Huh. Wow.

664
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,596
You're right.

665
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,800
It's been right in front
of my face all along.

666
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,880
My test is Lucifer.

667
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,673
It's always been Lucifer.

668
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,559
You're very wise, Linda.

669
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,196
Thanks, Amen.

670
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,672
- Mm...
- Yeah, it doesn't work, does it?

671
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,832
I, uh, had a rather
illuminating conversation

672
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,520
with our new lieutenant
last night.

673
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,074
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

674
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,590
Yet. He warned me not
to talk about the Sinnerman.

675
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,756
Yeah, he's right.

676
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,269
You sound crazy... er.

677
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,834
No. He actually knows...

678
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,117
Cyber tracked all the e-mails
to the same I.P. address.

679
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,238
A comedy club on Sunset
called The Laughmaker.

680
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,960
So do we think
he works there?

681
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,480
Maybe. The e-mails
were always sent

682
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,955
- Thursday nights at 8:00 p.m.
- And that's when

683
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,270
Bobby's show aired.
So it makes sense

684
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,357
that that could set him off.

685
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,789
Yeah, it's also when
they have open mic night,

686
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,798
so it could be any one of
the comedians performing, too.

687
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,390
Or a diehard fan.

688
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,960
Either way,
they're consistent.

689
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,031
It would make sense
that the killer

690
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,475
could be at the next
open mic night.

691
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,591
Which is tonight.

692
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,400
- So how do we draw him out?
- Easy.

693
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,353
Arrest everyone in the club
and pull their pants down.

694
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,994
Tiniest weenie wins, for once.

695
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,715
Or, our guy is clearly
sensitive, right?

696
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,950
Why don't we use that
to flush him out?

697
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,953
What, get someone on stage
that'll really piss him off?

698
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,870
Yeah. Yeah,
that could work.

699
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,510
And I think we all know
the perfect man for that job.

700
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,317
<i>All right,</i>

701
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,473
please welcome to the stage,
for the first time,

702
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,677
the devilishly
handsome...

703
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,913
Dan Espinoza.

704
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,117
Remember "yes, and," Daniel.

705
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,879
Hi, everybody.

706
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,390
Hey. Hi.

707
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,717
So, uh...

708
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,717
Um...

709
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,513
Oh...

710
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,395
Uh, I have a friend.

711
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,079
And... he's got a tiny penis.

712
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,390
- What?
- Uh...

713
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,875
a micropenis.

714
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,000
Uh, in fact,

715
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,878
his penis is so tiny,

716
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,560
it's not even a micropenis.

717
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,029
It's an atomic penis.

718
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,314
Because atoms are small.

719
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,876
Not because it ex... plodes.

720
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,997
- His, uh, penis is so small...
- Boo!

721
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,072
It's a medical condition,
you monster.

722
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,480
- Lucifer...
- What? Can't stop, won't stop.

723
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,909
This is much too
fun, Detective.

724
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,873
No, no, no, keep going.
I want you to keep going.

725
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,718
Copy that.

726
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,231
- Anyways...
- So what?

727
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,434
Next you're gonna tell us
that his willy's

728
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,279
so small that
when he wants to have sex,

729
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,800
he needs to call out
a search party?

730
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,680
Or that his weenis is so small,

731
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,195
it looks like his
testicles are giving

732
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,720
the tiniest thumbs up?

733
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,757
Huh?

734
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,076
Shame on you

735
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,078
for mocking the poorly-endowed.

736
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,237
- Yeah!
- Oh, hold on.

737
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,760
Maybe there's no friend at all,

738
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,792
and you're the one
with the baby carrot.

739
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,400
What? No.

740
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,996
No, I-I... I-I don't
have a micropenis.

741
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,395
I mean, not that there's
anything wrong with having one.

742
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,995
Come on.
Now's your chance.

743
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,112
Show the world your teeny, tiny,
itsy-bitsy baby arm.

744
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,879
I-I... I don't have
a tiny, teeny...

745
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,309
It's okay!

746
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,113
We accept you
for your miniscule manhood.

747
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,278
I don't have a tiny...

748
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,520
- Oh, my...
- Lucifer.

749
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,676
What, you didn't bring any?

750
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,837
Get off.

751
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,157
Or show us
your nubbin. Hmm?

752
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,397
- Yeah!
- Yeah. Boo!

753
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,473
There you go!

754
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,710
Oh, lovely.

755
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,031
What the hell was that, man?

756
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,114
You undermined
the entire sting.

757
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,835
Well, I'd argue
you undermined it

758
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,269
with your botched
attempt at humor.

759
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,312
All I did was throw a drowning man a tomato.

760
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,715
Oh, what are the chances?

761
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,032
I didn't even want to
do this to begin with.

762
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,512
And I told you stand-up and
improv are completely different.

763
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,917
And why didn't you stop him?

764
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,629
Because I realized the killer

765
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,194
might seek out
a sympathetic voice.

766
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,715
- Hmm.
- He wasn't sympathetic.

767
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,876
He just used it as an excuse

768
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,515
to tell even more
micropenis jokes.

769
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,191
There is no way anyone's
gonna appreciate that.

770
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,151
Hey, man.

771
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,160
I just, uh,
wanted to say...

772
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,233
really appreciate you
saying what you did.

773
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,196
- Huh.
- Ah.

774
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,359
Absolutely.
No problem at all.

775
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,995
I mean, someone has to stand up
for the little guy, am I right?

776
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:45,992
Yeah.

777
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,351
Hearing stuff like that just...

778
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,596
makes you
want to murder someone,

779
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,637
doesn't it?

780
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,076
- Sure does.
- Hmm.

781
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,960
Well done, Detective.
Right, just to be sure,

782
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,958
shall I pull his pants down,
or do you want the honors?

783
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,352
You're gonna
do what?

784
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,591
- Follow me.
- What?

785
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,870
- Come on.
- I...

786
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,470
I don't understand.

787
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,717
Having a micropenis
isn't a crime.

788
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,560
So you didn't send
threatening e-mails to Bobby Lowe?

789
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,394
No, I did.

790
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,031
Back when Bobby was nobody,
I toured with him.

791
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,913
And that's when I figured
he heard about my...

792
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,278
condition.

793
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,236
Um, how would he have
heard about that?

794
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,715
All the chuckle bunnies talk.

795
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,552
The what?

796
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,598
Uh...

797
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,069
chicks who like to
have sex with comedians.

798
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,396
Oh, there's a term for that?

799
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,034
Oh, I should get
a term.

800
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,560
- Oh.
- Devil bunnies.

801
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,359
Oh, no. Lucifans.

802
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,756
- Can you please...?
- Or not.

803
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,480
One in particular,
I told some stories,

804
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,076
and then, I heard them
as part of Bobby's set.

805
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,509
So then,
you started threatening him.

806
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,518
I was blowing off steam, okay?

807
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,154
Every time
that stupid show aired,

808
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,834
it was like
a punch in the gut.

809
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,392
And then you found out
that JD was writing the jokes.

810
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,954
And justifiably
murdered him.

811
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,520
I forgave him.

812
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,631
What?

813
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,400
But he stole your life story
and profited from it.

814
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,920
Why would you forgive him?

815
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,630
I don't mind a fellow
struggling comic busting balls.

816
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,753
It's when a millionaire starts
punching down that I get pissed.

817
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,631
Or that good-looking jerk
from the club.

818
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,234
- What? Who's he talking about?
- Oh.

819
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,033
- Dan.
- Oh. Right.

820
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,073
Are you sure?

821
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,840
Besides, JD's life
was pretty sad.

822
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,157
I mean, I think
his last gig was a barbecue.

823
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,399
He even made up this sad story
about a warm-up comic wanting

824
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,915
to meet with him about a gig.

825
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,152
- As if that'd happen.
- Why?

826
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,120
Is telling bad jokes before
even worse jokes a coveted gig?

827
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,111
Are you kidding?

828
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,352
You work an hour a day
and clear six figures.

829
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,040
Not to mention,
you probably get a role

830
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,509
on the show at some point.

831
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,035
- Oh.
- Really?

832
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,115
Do you remember the name
of the, uh, warm-up comedian?

833
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,269
Uh, Shelly maybe, or...?

834
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,358
- Sheila?
- Yeah, that was it.

835
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,676
Do you know her?

836
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,511
We're done here.

837
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,236
What? Detective,
what did I miss?

838
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,078
Who's Sheila?

839
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,511
Sheila's the name of
Bobby Lowe's warm-up comedian.

840
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,951
Right.

841
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,951
Detective, are you sure
that Sheila's here?

842
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:10,073
Her roommate said that she'd be
here working on new jokes, so...

843
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,353
Well, I still
don't understand.

844
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,359
She seemed devastated when
Bobby said he was a joke thief.

845
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,679
Well, maybe she's not
pissed off about the theft.

846
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:23,154
What? Well, then, what else
would she be angry about?

847
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,595
Let's find out.

848
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,391
Okay.

849
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,593
As if these puppets
weren't creepy enough.

850
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,030
Hello?

851
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,840
Anyone here?

852
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,480
Hello?

853
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,870
Lucifer?

854
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,757
Hello, Detective.

855
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,233
Sorry.

856
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,910
Well, don't worry. At least
I don't have a gun up my bum.

857
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,720
If you're not gonna
take this seriously,

858
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,630
then you wait here for me.

859
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,437
Okay.

860
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,949
Okay.

861
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,029
Hello?

862
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,155
Anyone here?

863
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,273
What, what's going on?

864
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,314
- Is she still here?
- Who? She? Sheila?

865
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,631
Did she do this to you?

866
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,280
I told her I was gonna quit,

867
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,711
and-and she freaked out
on me, started screaming

868
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,274
about everything
she-she'd done for me.

869
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,949
But I-I can't
take it any-anymore. My craft...

870
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,356
Okay, midlife crisis
later. How long ago?

871
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,513
Uh, a few minutes maybe.

872
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,154
We-we heard you come in,
and then she hit me

873
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,477
with the butt of her,
of her gun... in the face!

874
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,637
- She has a gun?
- Did-did you hear me?!

875
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,071
I said, in-in the face!
This is my moneymaker!

876
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,789
- Am I okay?
- Lucifer, she's here!

877
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,434
- No.
- She's armed!

878
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,634
Why did you do
it, Sheila?

879
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,196
Get out of the way!

880
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,356
I'm getting out of here.

881
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,914
Well, once you
answer my question,

882
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,879
I'll gladly let you past.

883
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,960
Why kill and torture a man
for this pretentious hack?

884
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,517
Do you know how hard it is to
crawl out of the stand-up world

885
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,120
and get a gig like this?

886
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,079
But he's a fellow comedian.

887
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,040
Why would you kill for someone

888
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,959
who stole jokes from
one of your own?

889
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,116
So he stole material.

890
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,432
Hell, he stole half my set, too.
Who cares?!

891
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,551
You should!

892
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,754
It's yours!

893
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,551
One might say your
very identity.

894
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,873
Jokes don't make a comedian.

895
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,839
Everyone has an itchy butt joke.

896
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,594
It's all about
what you do with it.

897
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,076
What you do with
your itchy butt?

898
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,112
- With the joke!
- Oh.

899
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,355
So, what you're saying is,

900
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,392
it's okay to steal
someone's work as long

901
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,835
as you do it better?

902
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,157
And take me with you?
Hell yeah, it is.

903
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,240
- Oh...
- Now, if you don't get out of my way...

904
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,594
I swear...

905
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,833
Excellent work, Detective.

906
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,557
Okay, so... how do we get her
down from here?

907
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,911
Daniel?

908
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,753
- You're not gonna throw a tomato at me, are you?
- Ugh.

909
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,195
Come now, Daniel.

910
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,551
I only did that for the good of the case.

911
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,633
Also, I ran out,
but more importantly,

912
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,155
did you text me to come here?

913
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,953
I didn't recognize the number,
so I assumed it was you.

914
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,196
You didn't save my number?

915
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,629
It was me.

916
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,198
Too much hard work
to break into my penthouse again

917
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,271
for a heart-to-heart?

918
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,950
I did some digging,
and you were right.

919
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,316
The Sinnerman is here in L.A.

920
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,120
Oh, right.

921
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,631
Are you not gonna
take my advice

922
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,991
- from last night?
- Most definitely not.

923
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,789
I thought so.

924
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,916
You brought the Sinnerman's
murderous thug in.

925
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,510
He's all yours.

926
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,873
I couldn't get anything
out of him. Maybe you can.

927
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,153
Oh. Right.

928
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,317
So, what, is this
you passing the baton?

929
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,880
- Where are you running off to next?
- Nowhere.

930
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,514
I'm seeing this through.

931
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,996
But you need to shut your
damn mouth about the Sinnerman.

932
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,839
We need to play this carefully.

933
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,196
Let's keep it between us.

934
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,513
The less people who know about it,

935
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,870
the less chance
anyone gets hurt.

936
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,276
- But the detective...
- Has a kid.

937
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,789
She stays out of it.

938
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,311
Very well.

939
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,280
Hello, Alonso.

940
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,632
Let's cut to the
chase, shall we?

941
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,074
I know the Sinnerman had you
skewer Sam under the pier,

942
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,634
so tell me everything.

943
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,590
Who the hell's the Sinnerman?

944
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,590
Fine.

945
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,437
Fine. Let's play
a little game, shall we?

946
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,717
Look at me.

947
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:52,957
Tell me.

948
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,633
Why did you really
desire Sam's death?

949
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,516
I... didn't want my girl
to sleep with him anymore.

950
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,477
And?

951
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,195
And... that's it.

952
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,194
I got pissed.

953
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,551
Went medieval on his ass
to send a message.

954
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,755
No one touches my girl.

955
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,474
And what about the Sinnerman?

956
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,959
Man, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

957
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,117
Oh, you must know.
Come on, Alonso.

958
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,470
What about the Sinnerman?

959
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:23,957
I don't know.

960
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,514
You must know!

961
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,917
I don't know
anything... I swear.

962
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,836
I believe you.

963
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,560
<i>He was telling the truth.</i>

964
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,790
I mean, maybe

965
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,549
the Sinnerman manipulated Alonso
without him realizing it.

966
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,360
Or perhaps he was just
a deranged fellow who felt

967
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,870
impaling a rival lover to death
was the way to his girl's heart.

968
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,758
It's a bit old-fashioned,
really.

969
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,032
Lucifer, I want
to talk about your wings.

970
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,550
Oh, bloody hell.
They're not out again?!

971
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,675
So they grew back?

972
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,392
They did... this morning.

973
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,069
Sneaky buggers.

974
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,359
- You can't keep doing this to yourself.
- Oh, I agree.

975
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,910
- You do?
- Yes.

976
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,234
It's getting exhausting...
and quite messy.

977
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,834
No, I need a new solution.

978
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,035
Maybe I should hire someone
to do it.

979
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,074
Or maybe your solution is

980
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,671
to accept that, for now,
you have wings again.

981
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,516
What, and let Dad win,
or whoever it bloody is?

982
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,672
I... I don't think so.

983
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,991
It's easy to let
external factors... define us.

984
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,512
Especially the traumatic ones.

985
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,755
But only if we let them.

986
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,800
We all have itchy butts.

987
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,070
Excuse me?

988
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,636
No, it's just something
a woman said to me

989
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,559
right before
I punched her in the face.

990
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,638
It's not about the idea.
It's about the execution.

991
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,638
It's about how I <i>use</i> the wings.

992
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,914
That's... actually...

993
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:10,917
pretty wise.

994
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,520
Yeah. So I'll just
tuck them away

995
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,518
- and pretend they don't exist.
- Less good.

996
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,911
Someone else is giving favors.
Who cares?

997
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,358
I'm Lucifer bloody Morningstar!

998
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,631
I do favors better
than anyone else.

999
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,713
Amongst other things,
of course.

1000
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,556
Or at least, I used to.

1001
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,994
And I think that maybe...

1002
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,073
...it's about time
I got back in the game.

1003
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,473
Hello.

1004
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,275
So, tell me. What is it
that you truly desire?
