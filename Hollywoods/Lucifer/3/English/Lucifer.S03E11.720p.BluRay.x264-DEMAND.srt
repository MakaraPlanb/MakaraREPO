1
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,837
What, have I mussed
my suit again?

2
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,633
It's impossible
to keep clean, this thing.

3
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,479
You have wings.

4
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,479
Ah. Right, yes, forgot.

5
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,275
Bit of a conversation-stopper
for you humans, isn't it?

6
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,436
There we go. That better?

7
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,279
Ah.

8
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,874
You take care.

9
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,117
All right.

10
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,391
Nice suit.

11
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,159
Oh, well, thank you very much.

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,589
My grandpa had one just like it.

13
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,276
- Grandfather? But...
- Mm-hmm.

14
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,676
This was the height of fashion
last time I visited.

15
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,599
Hmm. You here for business
or pleasure?

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,876
Oh, pleasure.

17
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,469
Always pleasure.

18
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,270
Oh, then you came
to the right place.

19
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,314
Off! Off! Off!
Off! Off! Off! Off!

20
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,795
Mm!

21
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:54,997
How can someone

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,395
who can literally
control time

23
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,557
have such atrocious timing?

24
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,190
Toying with
humans again, I see.

25
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,715
Oh, these poor creatures.

26
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,190
They know not what they do.

27
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,834
I beg to differ.

28
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,793
Everyone here is well aware
that they're doing me.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,514
Enough foolishness.

30
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,639
It's time for me
to take you back to Hell.

31
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,431
As always.

32
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,872
<i>allow zou</i> to take me back, as always.

33
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,275
Please.

34
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,069
Everyone knows I'm the strongest
of God's children.

35
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,392
Uh, not everybody.

36
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,632
I mean, you've never fought me,
have you, huh?

37
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,758
Care to give it a try?

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,320
You know damn well
that celestial beings

39
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,398
aren't allowed to
interact here on Earth.

40
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,319
Now, let's go.

41
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,160
It's dangerous for humanity
to be exposed to divinity.

42
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,840
Well, I wouldn't
sit on that couch...

43
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,520
left a lot of divinity there.

44
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,035
Enough!

45
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,679
Now, you can either
deal with me,

46
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,035
or you can deal with Father.

47
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,550
Yeah.

48
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,676
That's what I thought.

49
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,717
Very well.

50
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,594
Well, at least allow me
to say my good-byes.

51
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,395
I mean, that's just manners,
isn't it? Not that you'd know.

52
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,031
Ten minutes.

53
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,271
Right.

54
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,074
Nice dress.

55
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,236
It's a robe.

56
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,396
You wear it well.

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,195
Humans.

58
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,318
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

59
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,270
I'm just...

60
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,234
My necklace.

61
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,873
And this little demon
went, "Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee,"

62
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,514
all into the valley of sin.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,195
There's been a change
of plans, Luci.

64
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,351
Oh, G...

65
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,831
Oh. Not what I expected,
but, uh,

66
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,872
all right, fine, have fun.

67
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,395
Just go in the other room.

68
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,990
Or not.

69
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,994
Sorry, are you going somewhere?

70
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,354
Uh... listen,
I have an errand to run.

71
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,394
Why are there holes
in your dress?

72
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,590
It's a robe.

73
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,830
Oh, I apologize.

74
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,713
Why are there holes
in your dress?

75
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,670
Look, I don't trust you to see
yourself back to Hell, okay?

76
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,917
So I want you to stay here
for a few hours,

77
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,792
and then we'll go.

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,832
Oh. More time in L.A.

79
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,713
Lucky me.

80
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,558
You see, I respect
the rule of human law,

81
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,194
which is why
I'm seeking your assistance

82
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,993
in a matter
of utmost importance.

83
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,640
A robbery has occurred.

84
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,871
Okay.

85
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,832
What was stolen?

86
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,677
My necklace.

87
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,360
The estimated value?

88
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,230
It's hard to say,
really, uh...

89
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,911
It's not of this world,
so there's that.

90
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,235
Priceless beyond measure.

91
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,395
I'll just put down $40.

92
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,915
Where did the incident occur?

93
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,476
In an alleyway south of
"Cahunana" and Franklin.

94
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,318
Cahuenga?

95
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,040
"Cahunana" and Franklin.

96
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,919
Now, this thief
was armed,

97
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,079
and, oh, yes, uh,
I made a rendering.

98
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,036
And I do believe that this
should help you with your quest.

99
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,837
Okay.

100
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,552
So a jack-o'- lantern
stole your necklace?

101
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,513
So you know this man?

102
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,870
Where can I find
this Mr. O'Lantern?

103
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,757
Did Paolucci put you up to this?

104
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,475
You know it's a crime
to file a false report, right?

105
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,395
You think I would lie?

106
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,235
What?

107
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,550
Sorry, excuse me.

108
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,114
Just two seconds.

109
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,150
Hey, honey, what's up?

110
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,629
I'm not gonna make date night.

111
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,912
Oh, that's all right.

112
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,998
My mom just called,
and she has to shoot tonight,

113
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,793
so she can't watch
Trixie anyhow.

114
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,551
Well, I'm gonna be home
pretty late.

115
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,160
You want me to pick up
some dinner?

116
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,317
No, that's okay. There's stuff
for tacos in the fridge,

117
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,556
and we'll make it a thing.

118
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,796
We'll call it "Taco Tuesday."

119
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,678
Trixie will love it.

120
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,518
Cool.

121
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,157
So, what are you doing?

122
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,953
I caught a body
on Franklin and Cahuenga.

123
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,877
Really?

124
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,560
That's so weird;
a guy just came in,

125
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,080
reporting a mugging near there.

126
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,800
I wonder if it has
anything to do...

127
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,475
with your homicide.

128
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,198
Lucifer.

129
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,351
If only angels came
with a snooze button.

130
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,552
What? What is
it, Brother?

131
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,272
A human shot me
and stole my necklace.

132
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,077
Well, so much for not exposing
humanity to our divinity.

133
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,039
Which is why I need
to get it back, all right?

134
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:09,952
Oh.

135
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,032
Now, I tried to utilize
human law enforcement,

136
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,509
but it failed, so...

137
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,839
...I need
your help, Luci.

138
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,590
Oh, do you now?

139
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,310
Well, you've always
been crafty...

140
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,750
smart...

141
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,917
Craftier,
smarter than you.

142
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,713
Yes, and
more handsome.

143
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,996
Go on.

144
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,676
And because you've spent
more time with humanity,

145
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,194
you may understand them
better than I do.

146
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,478
Well, most of that time, I was
naked, but true nonetheless.

147
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,160
Luci, are you gonna
help me or not?

148
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,192
Hmm.

149
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,996
Okay.

150
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,755
But you have
to follow me.

151
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,394
Detective Espinoza.

152
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,077
Excuse me.

153
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:33,997
Officer Decker.

154
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,037
- Hi.
- Hi.

155
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,591
How's it going?

156
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,074
Dan, not at work, remember?

157
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,316
Sorry.

158
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,836
Hey, remember the, uh, robbery

159
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,355
I told you about,
happened around the corner?

160
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,311
Yeah.

161
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,512
Um, so I searched the area,

162
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,995
and I found this.

163
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,113
It looks like a key fob.

164
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,830
I don't know to what, but it
looks like there's blood on it,

165
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,350
and... do you think this could
be connected to your homicide?

166
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,036
Could be,
but even if it is,

167
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,112
all signs point to
a random attacker.

168
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,756
- A serial mugger on a spree.
- Hmm.

169
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,033
Looks like my guy resisted
and ended up dead.

170
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,875
- That's the guy that got mugged?
- Yeah.

171
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,673
- He's built like a tank.
- Yeah.

172
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,997
And so is the guy that
reported the robbery.

173
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,119
- They're the last two guys that I'd try to mug.
- Yeah.

174
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,793
Yeah, well, a gun can be
a pretty great equalizer.

175
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,152
I don't think
this was random, Dan.

176
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,239
Okay, I'll look
into it, but...

177
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,760
only when I'm done;
it's gonna be a while.

178
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,275
Okay, why don't I
get a jump on it?

179
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,357
No.

180
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,032
Dan, you said to make detective,

181
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,072
I have to
show initiative, right?

182
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,112
- Right. Right.
- Mm-hmm.

183
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,154
Let me know what you hear,
Officer Decker.

184
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,594
Oh, lovely.

185
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,910
Amazing.

186
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,873
Does no one work in this town?

187
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,238
Is this where thieves come
to spend their spoils

188
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,880
on wine and women?

189
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,275
Something like that, yeah.

190
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,560
Oh. Brother, listen to that.

191
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,871
Oh.

192
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,912
I haven't heard music
like that since...

193
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,436
well, since
the Silver City.

194
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,160
What, there's
no music in Hell?

195
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,200
Only for torture,
and usually out of tune.

196
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,160
Lately, we've been playing music
by this chap named Bieber.

197
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,760
Gosh, you should
hear the screams.

198
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,517
Why don't you go and, um,
grab us a couple of drinks,

199
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,399
and I'll do some
reconnaissance.

200
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,596
Do you take requests?

201
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,156
What do you want to hear?

202
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,159
Uh, myself.

203
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:34,991
Thank you.

204
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,993
You didn't come here
to find this thief, did you?

205
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,473
You're just trying to stall
your return to Hell.

206
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,430
Oh, I really hoped to get
a few more drinks in

207
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,391
before you worked that one out.

208
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,159
Luci, this isn't some game.

209
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,393
Now, how many times
do I have to tell you?

210
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,274
Humanity should not
be exposed to...

211
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,119
It's just a necklace,
for crying out loud.

212
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,834
You promised me
that you would help.

213
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,475
And I am by distracting you
from the painful reality

214
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,319
that you're never
going to find it.

215
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,074
...found earlier
today near Cahuenga and Franklin.

216
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,676
The police have identified
the murder victim

217
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,076
as MMA fighter Aiden Scott.

218
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,240
Scott's body was found
this morning,

219
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,397
the victim of
an apparent shooting.

220
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,758
Luci, look.

221
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,798
His family has been notified.

222
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,518
Born in Lancaster, California,

223
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,519
Aiden Scott moved
to Los Angeles...

224
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,677
What?

225
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,190
I know this man.

226
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,640
Uh, the runner,
right before the theft.

227
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,230
What, you think he had
something to do with it?

228
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,920
Exactly, Brother.

229
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,710
Whoever killed this Aiden Scott
must also be the same thief

230
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,391
who tried to kill me,
and then took my necklace.

231
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,672
The LAPD currently
have no leads.

232
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,109
How are we gonna find him

233
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,119
if his own kind
can't even locate him?

234
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,158
Which is why I
recommend drinking.

235
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,678
Coming up,

236
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,953
we will learn more
about the life of Aiden Scott

237
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,954
and who he left behind.
We'll talk to some of...

238
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,759
Actually, do you know,
I think I might be able

239
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,514
to help you, Brother,
but I'm gonna need

240
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,632
more than a few extra
hours here on Earth.

241
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,270
Name your price.

242
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,839
Ooh, well, I can't actually
think of anything right now,

243
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,192
so how about a blank check,

244
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,357
cashed at a time of my choosing?

245
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,869
Agreed.

246
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,196
Well, say it properly.

247
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,440
Say it.

248
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,397
Deal.

249
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,357
Deal.

250
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,790
Right, come on.

251
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,593
Okay, how about that one?

252
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,350
Too douchey.

253
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,595
Too hick.

254
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,110
Ah.

255
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,074
Hello.

256
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,749
Don't you need some sort
of key to start it?

257
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,675
You know me, Brother.

258
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,196
I can turn anything on.

259
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,431
Obviously, "R" is for reverse,
not "really fast."

260
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,356
Hello.

261
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,194
What's going on here?

262
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,312
Uh, well, Brother,

263
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,637
when a man and a woman
really care about each other,

264
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,794
they do a special cuddle
for the cameras,

265
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,751
which they sell
for money.

266
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,155
Luci, I know what porn is.

267
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,476
Oh, do you now?

268
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,870
Focus.

269
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,639
What I don't get is
how this helps us

270
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,513
track down this thief;
why are we here?

271
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,632
Well, two reasons,
actually.

272
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,832
Uh, boobs.

273
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,355
Why am I not surprised?

274
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,236
No, remember
that news report thingy?

275
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,875
Well, there was a picture
of our dead man

276
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,517
standing next to a very
distinctive décolletage.

277
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,155
You identified a
human by her boobs?

278
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,516
Not any boobs, Brother.

279
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,040
These ones are very special.

280
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,800
That mole, those curves,

281
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,193
they could only belong to
the one and only Misty Canyons.

282
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,357
And exactly how does this
help me find my necklace?

283
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,075
Well, if we want to
find Aiden's killer,

284
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,430
what better way
to get information

285
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,557
than from his lover?

286
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,029
Trust me,

287
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,674
a church confessional
has nothing

288
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,200
compared to pillow talk.

289
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,075
Oh, my gosh,
that's her, in the flesh.

290
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,396
That's Misty Canyons.

291
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,669
Oh, my gosh!
That's Penis Demilo.

292
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,996
Ha!

293
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,953
What is this, nirvana?

294
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,876
Do all porn stars
reside in L.A.?

295
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,550
Right, how do I look?

296
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,194
Oh, come on, Luci.

297
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,119
There must be hundreds
of porn stars in Hell.

298
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,271
Sadly, no, on account
of all the good work

299
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,233
they do here on Earth, I assume.

300
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,393
Right, maybe she'll
sign my chest,

301
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,592
or something else.

302
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,720
Sorry, it's a closed set.

303
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,435
I'm here to talk to
Misty Canyons about pillow talk.

304
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,909
Why didn't you say so?

305
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,956
Ms. Canyons.

306
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,551
Hi.

307
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,194
Lucifer Morningstar.

308
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,195
Can I just say that I am
a huge, huge fan of yours?

309
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,472
Oh, my gosh.
Thank you so much.

310
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,080
<i>L.A. Whorey</i>. What a classic.

311
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,755
Aw. I really put my all
into that one.

312
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,713
Yes, you did, didn't you?
And it showed.

313
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,559
One might say that
you were born for it.

314
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,434
Oh. Well, my dream
is to sing,

315
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,155
but until then, porn pays
way better than waitressing.

316
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,191
Ah.

317
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,596
Plus, I kind of like it.

318
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,039
Goodness me,
your parents must be so proud.

319
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,117
I wish.

320
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,040
Well, they told me
to do what I love,

321
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,436
and turns out I love sex.

322
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,955
Oh, so you're a rebel.

323
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,040
I guess so.

324
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,119
And if you really want to rebel,
move to L.A., right?

325
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,750
All I know is that I have
never been happier, freer.

326
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,480
Uh, we're ready for
you on set, Misty.

327
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,477
Okay.

328
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,830
Well, if you ever
do decide

329
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,474
to do something worthy
of damnation,

330
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,909
I'd love to see you again.

331
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,876
Where's the rest of it?

332
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,554
Ooh, I almost forgot.

333
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,951
You must be
the window washer.

334
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,150
Well, good thing,

335
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,671
because I was feeling dirty.

336
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,156
I am here to discuss
a lost necklace.

337
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,633
So, you're
a window-washer

338
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,876
jeweler?

339
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,551
No.

340
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,997
Well, this took a turn,
didn't it?

341
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,550
Well, I haven't seen
your necklace.

342
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,320
Was it made of pearls,
by chance?

343
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,671
It's actually a rod.

344
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,516
Unbreakable, very special.

345
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,758
Time to see the family jewels.

346
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,515
What? No, no, no!

347
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,076
Y-You're not gonna find
my necklace down there.

348
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,277
The man who killed
Aiden Scott has it.

349
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:14,991
What?

350
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,275
Aiden's dead?

351
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,872
Aiden was such a good guy.

352
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,073
He accepted everyone,
you know?

353
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,353
I can't think of anyone
who'd want to hurt him.

354
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,352
Even the people he fought
respected him.

355
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,716
He lost a lot.

356
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,990
But he never quit.

357
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,715
Aiden actually thought
he could win the fight

358
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,357
he had coming up, though,
which is why he was so pissed

359
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,914
when someone asked him
to throw it.

360
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,590
Someone asked him to throw
that fight, but he refused?

361
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,598
For a ton of money, yeah.

362
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,072
But he didn't care,
he just wanted to win,

363
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,630
fair and square.

364
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,993
Whoever tried to bribe Aiden
to throw that fight

365
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,396
must have been pretty angry
when temptation didn't sway him.

366
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,592
Maybe the tempter killed
him in frustration,

367
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,755
and then took my necklace.

368
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,760
You have any idea
who approached him?

369
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,795
No. I mean, the fight was
supposed to be tomorrow

370
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,354
at Rico's in Hollywood.

371
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,390
Maybe someone there would know.

372
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,878
Everyone's real
torn up about Aiden.

373
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,029
We're like family here.

374
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,237
So, uh, you were close
with him, too?

375
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,280
He was a scrawny little thing
when I started training him.

376
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,959
But one dedicated
son of a "B."

377
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,749
Nothing could stop that guy.

378
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,357
Well, almost nothing.

379
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,280
Uh, do you know if Aiden ran
the same route every day?

380
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,949
I think so. Why?

381
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,956
Well, 'cause if somebody
wanted to kill him,

382
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,480
you know, they'd
know where he'd be.

383
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,440
I thought you cops were saying
this was just a random robbery.

384
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,118
Did you notice any unusual
behavior with Aiden lately?

385
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,152
Uh, arguments, grudges?

386
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,798
Well, actually, there was
one guy he butted heads with:

387
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,720
a promoter, Tio Sorrento.

388
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,153
Sketchy guy.
Never paid his fighters.

389
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,837
Tio and his tattooed buddy
got into it with Aiden

390
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,474
a couple weeks back.

391
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,316
But I didn't think
anything of it.

392
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,556
You know where I can find him?

393
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,397
I could get used
to this place.

394
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,233
So what's the plan?

395
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,351
Lucifer!

396
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,279
What's the plan?

397
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,552
I...

398
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,235
Plan is to get a drink.

399
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,840
Can't think
when I'm sober.

400
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,077
Hello.

401
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,475
Apparently, they have, uh,

402
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,319
12 different types
of whiskey.

403
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,234
Yes, humans are funny

404
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,591
with their infinite capacity
for distractions.

405
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,553
It's not distraction, Brother.

406
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,716
It's choice.

407
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,758
LAPD! Freeze!

408
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,871
Excuse me.

409
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,237
If you're through
with your distraction,

410
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,197
I'd like to find
my necklace.

411
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,035
Two fingers of your finest
Scotch, please, neat.

412
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,279
And, uh, who looks
after the fights?

413
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,751
Tio Sorrento. Everything
goes through him.

414
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,594
Thank you.

415
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,759
Apparently,
you arranged the fight

416
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,434
that a recently deceased
Aiden Scott

417
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,199
was going to wage.

418
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,917
Let me guess.

419
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,839
Your fighter wants on the card
tomorrow night.

420
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,360
My fighter?
But...

421
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,638
Oh, yes. No, Amenadiel is
quite the warrior.

422
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,874
Undefeated in battle,
one of God's finest.

423
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,796
Actually, that's true.

424
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,471
How come I've never
seen you two before?

425
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,636
What's your name?

426
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,274
Lucifer Morningstar.

427
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,631
- Pleasure.
- Where are you two from?

428
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,354
- Down south.
- Up north.

429
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,911
Sorry, I don't book strangers.

430
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,317
I'm afraid I must insist.

431
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,959
You just knocked out
the former heavyweight champ

432
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,798
with one punch.

433
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,831
Like I said,

434
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,315
God's finest.

435
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,156
My man.

436
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,951
How does this plan help me
get my necklace back?

437
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,392
Well, our
killer/necklace thief

438
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,957
undoubtedly murdered Aiden Scott
for refusing to throw his fight.

439
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,078
So, in order
to flush out

440
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,840
our killer/necklace thief, we
need to get them to approach you

441
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,754
the same way that he or she
approached our dead fighter.

442
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,229
It's quite simple, really.

443
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,352
- Or stupid.
- Yes.

444
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,596
Well, the jewelry
recovery playbook's

445
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,990
a little thin here, Brother,

446
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,560
so unless you have
any better ideas...

447
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,356
Didn't think so.

448
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,320
But why do I need
to train, Luci?

449
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,398
I am the Silver City's
greatest fighter.

450
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,199
Again, disputable.

451
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,629
You raised
a few too many eyebrows

452
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,069
with your
one-punch knockout.

453
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,033
So no more displays
of celestial strength.

454
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,560
If we want to be approached,

455
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,911
then you need to learn
to fight like a human.

456
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,510
<i>¿Comprende?</i>

457
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,797
Okay.

458
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,831
Give us your worst.

459
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,630
Go!

460
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,800
Uh, uh-uh! No.

461
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,195
No cheating.

462
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,517
Eh.

463
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,751
Very good.

464
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:21,991
Finally.

465
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,998
Lovely. Yes. Yes.

466
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,637
Yes.

467
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,717
There we go.

468
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,956
Oh, Brother.

469
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,070
Your fighter
looks good.

470
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,796
Well, I certainly hope so,

471
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,310
'cause I'm ready
to make some cash.

472
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,798
Which is all
I really care about.

473
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,271
Cold hard cash.

474
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,995
Win or lose?

475
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,834
Whatever it takes.

476
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,915
So he'd take a fall?

477
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,995
For the right price.

478
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,109
Rumor has it that Aiden Scott
was offered a hell of a deal,

479
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,312
so we want the same.

480
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,996
Well, that someone is me.

481
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,550
Lovely.

482
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,836
Dan.

483
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,671
Hey, what's up?

484
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,280
- Hey.
- Who's that?

485
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,359
One of Tio Sorrento's thugs.

486
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,154
The, uh, fight promoter
you were telling me about.

487
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,517
Yeah. Who was seen
arguing with Aiden Scott

488
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,989
just before he was killed.

489
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,157
Tats here has
multiple warrants out,

490
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,993
and after a little squeeze,
I found out

491
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,038
that Tio fixes fights
for the Sarkisians.

492
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,794
As in the Sarkisian
crime family?

493
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,117
Yeah, so what if Tio tried
to fix Aiden's fight,

494
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,640
and he refused,
and he killed him for it?

495
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,550
Well, I'd say that's
a pretty interesting theory.

496
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,310
I sense there's an "and" coming.

497
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,239
And I'd like to talk
to Tio's lawyer,

498
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,397
- see if I can maneuver a deal.
- Not a good idea.

499
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,035
- Why?
- 'Cause you don't have any actual proof yet, Chloe.

500
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,558
All right? If
you're wrong,

501
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,029
you get nothing
and Tio knows we're onto him.

502
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,879
Dan, I'm right. I can feel it.

503
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,759
Chloe, we'll
look into Tio.

504
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,474
But right now, you
got to be patient.

505
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,317
Oh.

506
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,949
So, uh...

507
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,516
has he got your necklace?

508
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,279
He claims to not know
its whereabouts.

509
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,513
I suppose it's time
to torture him.

510
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,875
So, you're up.

511
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,039
Look, just because
I am the King of Hell

512
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,232
doesn't mean I actually
do the torturing.

513
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,320
I'm more of
a delegator.

514
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,876
But I assumed this
was going to happen,

515
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,392
so I popped back down
while you were in there

516
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,199
and brought
up the best.

517
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,875
You remember Mazikeen.

518
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,039
Hello, human.

519
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,150
Where am I?

520
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,391
Who are you?

521
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,229
I'm a demon.

522
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,232
And I've risen from
the bowels of Hell

523
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,511
- to torture you.
- I already told that other guy

524
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,399
I don't know nothing
about Aiden Scott.

525
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,037
That "other guy" wouldn't
know a flanged mace

526
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,030
from this...

527
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,274
...stabbing object.

528
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,072
I'm here for the truth.

529
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,440
You don't have to do this.

530
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,437
No.

531
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,720
I <i>get</i> to do this.

532
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,589
Asphyxiation?

533
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,600
Electrocution?

534
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,070
There are so many ways

535
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,509
I could hurt you.

536
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,438
I just can't decide.

537
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,231
Wow.

538
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,511
I'm on fire,

539
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,910
aren't you?

540
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,631
No.

541
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,952
I thought Hell was hot.

542
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,113
Well, that human
didn't kill anybody.

543
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,675
And he doesn't know where your
stupid necklace is, either.

544
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,678
Also a bit of a crier, it seems.

545
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,360
I hope you didn't
go too hard, Maze.

546
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,279
He's not in Hell yet.

547
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,277
Oh, no.

548
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,472
Those are tears of joy.

549
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,080
Oh, so he's a masochist.

550
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,471
They can be
quite tricky.

551
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,477
What did you use

552
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,477
to inflict the pain?

553
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,355
- Nothing.
- Hmm?

554
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,879
In Hell, I have to use their own
guilt against them as torture.

555
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,355
The method is
chosen for them,

556
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,710
but here, Lucifer...

557
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,470
...infinite possibilities.

558
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,120
I got so excited,

559
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,039
I just had sex with him.

560
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,680
And then he wouldn't shut up.

561
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,837
Enough.

562
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,278
That man tried to bribe me into
throwing a fight, all right?

563
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,593
Now, he practically admitted
doing the same with Aiden Scott,

564
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,075
so he must be lying to you.

565
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,232
Nobody lies to me.

566
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,989
The human said
he wanted to fix

567
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,358
the dead one's fight,
but someone beat him to it.

568
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,757
Said someone placed
a huge anonymous bet.

569
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,072
Half a million dollars
on Aiden Scott losing.

570
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,680
Whoever placed that bet

571
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,991
probably killed Aiden Scott
and stole my necklace.

572
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,630
Tio doesn't know
who that is, either.

573
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,078
Said they only communicated
anonymously...

574
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,000
...through burner phones
and dead drops.

575
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,711
So Tio has no idea
who this man is,

576
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,039
and no way of finding out.

577
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,835
Which basically means
your so-called torture

578
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,116
has been useless.

579
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,831
You want to go, bird boy?

580
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,554
Ooh, now this is
getting interesting.

581
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,080
Luci, we still need
to find this thief.

582
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,470
And you're not gonna...

583
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,960
Very well.

584
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,840
Whoever stole your necklace
tried to gamble on a sure thing.

585
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,596
So, maybe we could persuade
our thief to gamble on another.

586
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,719
So if we convince
this killer thief

587
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,389
to bet on my fight instead,

588
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,398
and I take the fall
I promise to take,

589
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,557
then we wait wherever the money
is supposed to be dropped off,

590
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,916
and then we see who shows up.

591
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,713
You are cleverer than you look.

592
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,232
Maze, do you think you can
persuade Tio to arrange that?

593
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,276
Where should I begin?

594
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,120
Excuse me... oh, no, no.
I'm good. Charlotte Richards.

595
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,437
Hi. I'm here regarding
your client Tio sorrento.

596
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,630
I'm sorry,
Ms. Richards, she just...

597
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,638
Oh, it's fine, Etienne.

598
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,274
I always have time
for law enforcement.

599
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,994
You <i>are</i> law
enforcement, yes?

600
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,796
Yes, I, um...
I'm Officer Decker,

601
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,554
and I'm here to help Tio.

602
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,957
And what makes you think
that I need your help

603
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,038
representing my client? Hmm?

604
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,036
Uh, well, because we know he
works for the Sarkisian family.

605
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,913
- Mm-hmm.
- And he's also implicated

606
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,952
in the murder
of Aiden Scott.

607
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,277
So if he agrees
to speak with us,

608
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,119
we'll go easier on him.

609
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,153
Have you ever heard of
something called "leverage,"

610
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,316
Officer Decker?

611
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,318
If not, let me help you.

612
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,355
It's like pressure or influence,

613
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,677
and it's something
that you currently can't apply,

614
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,794
because none of what you
said actually resembles

615
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,471
proof of a crime.

616
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,030
Why do you say that?

617
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,796
Because when you're out there
writing traffic tickets,

618
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,438
I'm representing families
like the Lings and the Sokolovs.

619
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,596
Actual killers.

620
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,512
Alleged, anyway.

621
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,150
So it's going to take
a lot more than spunk...

622
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,752
especially rookie spunk...
and a prayer to intimidate me.

623
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,959
You represent
the Sokolov family?

624
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,996
And you also represent

625
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,680
Tio and the Sarkisians.

626
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,995
So, I-I thought
the Sarkisians

627
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,520
and the Sokolovs were at war

628
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,837
over their bookmaking
operations.

629
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,680
I wonder how they'd feel
if they knew

630
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,554
that their lawyer
was double-dipping.

631
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,316
You know,
I'm-I'm new at this, so...

632
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,160
I don't know what the term is
for what you're doing,

633
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,551
but I think
it's called "leverage."

634
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,192
Please have a seat, Officer.

635
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,074
Aw, thank you.

636
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,153
I didn't expect you
to be so happy

637
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,033
to lose your first
fight ever, Brother.

638
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,720
And to a human, no less.

639
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,673
Nice try, Luci, but we both
know this doesn't count.

640
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,553
- Ah.
- Not to mention the fact

641
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,558
that no mere mortal could
ever stand a chance

642
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,995
against the full power
of my God-given...

643
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,429
Forget it.
I regret mentioning it.

644
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,992
Looks like you might be
up soon, Brother.

645
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,993
Luci, thanks.

646
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,833
- What?
- Thanks for your help.

647
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,709
I mean, I... will admit
that I was a bit skeptical

648
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,872
of your plan, but this
might actually work.

649
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,639
Yes, of course
it'll work, Brother.

650
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,149
That's why you asked me,
remember?

651
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,079
Someone crafty, smart...

652
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,158
And evil.

653
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,077
Evil?

654
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,279
Well, if you want to find
a deplorable criminal,

655
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,597
you just ask a... well,
you know what I mean, Luci.

656
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,790
Come on.

657
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,480
You are the Devil, after all.

658
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,190
Ladies and gentlemen,

659
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,676
we have a scratch on the card.

660
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:29,358
Please welcome
a new fighter to the cage:

661
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,555
Lucifer...

662
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,077
Morningstar!

663
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,440
You wanted the Devil.

664
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,675
Well, you got him.

665
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,710
Where's the human fighter?

666
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,753
Off to join
the Renaissance fair,

667
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,711
whatever that is.

668
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,116
Apparently, he
loves the mandolin.

669
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,795
So that leaves you

670
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,036
with big bad me.

671
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,475
Why are you doing this, Lucifer?

672
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,872
Well, who better than the Devil

673
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,954
to help you do something
so wickedly dishonest

674
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,514
as to throw a fight?

675
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,835
- You're welcome, by the way.
- This is pointless!

676
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,111
Well, we're finally answering
the age-old question:

677
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,959
"Who'd win in a fight,
you or me?"

678
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,799
This doesn't count!

679
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,200
So be it, Brother.

680
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,314
So be it.

681
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,595
I'll make sure I tell
everyone in Heaven and Hell

682
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,757
how the undefeated
warrior lost

683
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,192
to his loser, evil,
little brother.

684
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,313
Oh, I guess you're not so tough
after all, are you, eh?

685
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,510
Daddy's boy.

686
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,156
See?

687
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,274
You're just as bad
as me, Brother.

688
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,314
Pride is your sin, too.

689
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,230
Get up.

690
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,395
What am I doing?

691
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,871
Fight me.

692
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,911
No.

693
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,750
You see, I won't
stoop down to your level.

694
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,677
Because I am
better than you are.

695
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,319
Fight me!

696
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,680
Winner by submission!

697
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,998
It's been, like,
two hours, Chloe.

698
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,833
I seriously doubt
Tio Sorrento's gonna show up.

699
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,110
Especially now that
he knows he's a suspect

700
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,430
in Aiden Scott's murder.

701
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,830
He swore to Charlotte Richards

702
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,520
that he had nothing to do
with the murder

703
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,040
and that he'd help us
find the killer.

704
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,755
So he's just gonna drop a bunch
of cash off into a locker?

705
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,792
Yeah, if that's what's gonna
clear his name.

706
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,877
And whoever picks it up

707
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,799
either killed Aiden Scott
or knows who did.

708
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,600
And if you're wrong?

709
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,916
Tio doesn't show up,

710
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,873
he alerts his bosses
about our investigation.

711
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,511
Our entire case against
them is destroyed.

712
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,710
You know, going to see
Charlotte Richards,

713
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,240
that was a big gamble.

714
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,351
And I want you
to make detective,

715
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,199
more than anyone,

716
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,596
but I'm worried that this
is gonna set you back.

717
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,030
I know.

718
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,550
I know you are.

719
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,355
But sometimes this job
is about taking risks, right?

720
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,510
Besides, you know,
my gut tells me I'm right.

721
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,073
Most impressive, Brother,
swallowing your pride like that.

722
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,754
Hope you haven't spent
too long on Earth.

723
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,189
It seems to have softened you.

724
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,272
Luci, I just hope
whoever stole my necklace

725
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,432
won't take too long
to pick up their winnings.

726
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,078
The sooner I can grab him
and retrieve it,

727
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,270
the sooner I can leave.

728
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,397
I think we both

729
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,795
stayed here for far too long.

730
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,157
Killer/necklace
thief alert.

731
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,157
Is that Gil,

732
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,350
the owner of the gym?

733
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,232
- Yeah.
- Ugh.

734
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,396
All right, I'll arrest him.

735
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,636
You grab Tio.

736
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,032
Gil. Drop the bag.

737
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,510
Where's my necklace?

738
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,392
Where am I?

739
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,273
Who are you? What necklace?

740
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,834
The one you stole from me.

741
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,150
Wait.

742
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,714
That was you in the street?

743
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,036
H-How'd we get here?

744
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,351
We flew.

745
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,550
Thought we needed
a bit of privacy.

746
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,637
Who are you?

747
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,997
And you, I-I-I shot you.

748
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,833
And yet
he's standing here alive.

749
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,110
It's shocking, isn't it?

750
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,159
Look, I-I don't want
any trouble.

751
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,476
I'll get you a new necklace.

752
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,995
No, see, I want mine.

753
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,157
It's just a necklace.
What's the big deal about it?

754
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,238
Because my father gave it to me!

755
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,557
Look.

756
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,078
Taking the necklace
wasn't part of my plan.

757
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,197
So you planned to
kill the other human?

758
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,114
No, that was a mistake, too.

759
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,635
Aiden was like a son to me.

760
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,116
I got into some money trouble.
I thought of a fix.

761
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,510
Aiden throws his fight.

762
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,231
We bet on it,
take home a huge payday.

763
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,597
Both of us.

764
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,309
But the fighter didn't want
to play his part, did he?

765
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,433
He said he'd rather walk away
from it than throw it.

766
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,631
I went to try to scare him,

767
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,360
but Aiden fought back.

768
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,399
I panicked, I shot him.

769
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,238
Tried to make it look
like a robbery.

770
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,677
That's when I saw you.

771
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,837
I-I didn't know
what you'd seen, I'm sorry.

772
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,311
I'm gonna ask you
for the last time.

773
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,195
Where...

774
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,840
is my necklace?

775
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,991
It's in the gym.

776
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,550
It's in my safe.

777
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,673
Let's go drop him
back at the beach.

778
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,075
Just a moment.

779
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,594
So you killed
your so-called "son"

780
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,200
for refusing
to play a part

781
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,556
in your plan.

782
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,630
Now, that is just pure evil.

783
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,280
And I should know.

784
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,919
Because I am the King of Evil.

785
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,393
No! No!

786
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,234
I did it!

787
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,351
I...

788
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,634
Where the hell
did he come from?

789
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,355
I did it.
I-I killed Aiden Scott.

790
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,710
I'm sorry,
it's-it's all my fault.

791
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,639
I... I killed him.

792
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,198
Sounds like
a confession to me.

793
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,040
Looks like your gamble paid off.

794
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,912
Luci, why are we back here?

795
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,634
It's time for
us to leave.

796
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,397
We've been here on
Earth long enough.

797
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,109
Yes, you see, that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

798
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,512
I'm not leaving.

799
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,874
What?

800
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,471
I'm saying that I've realized
something here

801
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,473
in this City of Angels.

802
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,994
That I really am
no longer one anymore.

803
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,076
And if that's true,

804
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,033
then why am I still
trying to please Father?

805
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,272
Eons... eons... spent condemned
to my fate in Hell,

806
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,319
and yet I'm still trying
to seek His approval.

807
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,752
Still playing a part
in His play.

808
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,358
Well, no more, Brother.

809
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,875
He abandoned me,
so why shouldn't I abandon Him?

810
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,160
It's time I fully accept
how everyone else sees me:

811
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,791
the rebel.

812
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,954
As a wise woman
once said to me,

813
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,720
"If you really want
to rebel, move to L.A."

814
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,070
Stop.

815
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,279
Lucifer, as much as I am moved
by your sentiment,

816
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,789
unfortunately, that's a no.

817
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,798
You are coming back
to Hell with me.

818
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,911
There's no discussion.

819
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,437
Yes, you see...

820
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,359
this is where
it gets interesting.

821
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,514
We made a deal,
didn't we,

822
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,797
for a favor to be named later.

823
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,075
Later is now.

824
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,600
And my ask, it's quite simple.

825
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,157
Leave me be.

826
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,350
You know I can't do that.

827
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,517
Well, isn't it a sin for
an angel to break a vow?

828
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,315
Oh, Luci.

829
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,997
Father will be furious.

830
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,272
And you will suffer His wrath.

831
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,637
Well...

832
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,438
...then He knows
where to find me.

833
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,560
This place could use a piano.
