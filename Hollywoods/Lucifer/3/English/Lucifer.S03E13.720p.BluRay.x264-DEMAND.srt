00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,437
<i>- Previously on</i> Lucifer...
<i>- Hey, Lieutenant,</i>

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,278
<i>are you going somewhere?</i>

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,636
I put in for a transfer.

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,717
Maybe you don't have to go.

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,434
As a thank you
for watching Trixie,

6
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,279
maybe we can go grab
that coffee sometime.

7
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,755
Dinner would be
more romantic.

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,519
Did you know that Linda
and Amenadiel are a thing?

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,915
So our old flames
are having a fling.

10
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,594
I don't care,
why should you?

11
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,556
Unless you're still
hot for angel.

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,750
No!

13
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,590
<i>You know, for an immortal,</i>

14
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,360
<i>you really do bleed a lot,
don't you?</i>

15
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,280
I'm still human.
I still feel

16
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,119
all the pain
that comes with death.

17
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,436
It's just the wounds heal.

18
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,273
Do your thing. Ask me.

19
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,630
Cain.

20
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,473
What is it that
you desire?

21
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,551
To die.

22
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,229
I will find a way to end
your infinite misery

23
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,994
if it's the last thing I do.

24
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,637
Lucifer?

25
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,396
Lucifer!

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,000
Hello, Lucifer?

27
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,517
If it were that easy to kill me,

28
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,154
I would have been dead
a long time ago.

29
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,316
Very well.

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,234
Right, have you tried...

31
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,999
- grenade down the throat?
- Yes.

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,594
- Acid bath?
- Mm-hmm.

33
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,713
Devoured by wolves?

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,558
Yes.

35
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,716
Dropped into helicopter blades?

36
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,637
Mm-hmm.

37
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,717
I've been trying
to kill myself

38
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,320
since the Bronze Age.

39
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,591
I have tried

40
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,234
everything.

41
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,794
Even jumped into a volcano once.

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,559
What, you survived molten lava?

43
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,832
Yeah, it was a rough six months.
Just, whatever I do, I just...

44
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,310
regrow.

45
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,473
Huh, like a blue-eyed,
square-jawed tapeworm.

46
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,673
So if I cut you exactly in half,
would there be two Pierces?

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,435
No. Only one side would heal.

48
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,518
You see, I call it the,
the "master molecule" theory.

49
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,035
Yes, yes, Wolverine rules.
I get it.

50
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,432
But...

51
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,438
there must be some
method that works.

52
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,479
Lucifer, why do you care
so much about this?

53
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,519
Because my Father laid a curse
on you to live forever,

54
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,872
so killing you would be an epic
loogie in the old man's eye.

55
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,957
Well, you are the Devil.

56
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,719
You must have something
shockingly evil

57
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,751
up your sleeve.

58
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,872
Mm, you mean, uh...

59
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,432
- something like this?
- Aah!

60
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,475
Ouch!

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,318
Thanks.

62
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,636
You're most welcome.

63
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,595
'Cause that little bad boy was
forged in the bowels of Hell.

64
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,230
Oh, yes, demon steel.

65
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,511
Can kill even me, so...

66
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,158
time to say good-bye
to Hollywood, Pierce.

67
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,110
Good-bye, Lucifer.

68
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,830
No, I-I don't understand.
How does this not work?

69
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,997
I should have known

70
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,080
that you wouldn't be able
to figure this out.

71
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,751
Well, I mean,
the good news is

72
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,713
we've got all the time
in the world to do so.

73
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,120
For me, that's a bad thing.

74
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,758
Hey, Dan.

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,036
- Hey.
- Thank you.

76
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,592
I feel like I'm having déjà vu.
This street seems so familiar.

77
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,751
Yeah, well, it should.

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,400
We took a look at that house
right there on the corner.

79
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,114
Remember? Right after
Trixie was born.

80
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,438
Oh, yeah. Great public schools,
really safe neighborhood.

81
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,994
Oh... or not.

82
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,920
June Lee, 34.

83
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,237
Local chemistry teacher.
She lived right down the block.

84
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,437
Forestry service left the
wood chipper here overnight,

85
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,836
and someone took advantage.

86
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,914
Did you get a chance to talk
to any of the lookie-loos yet?

87
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,031
Nope.

88
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,031
All yours.

89
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,430
Okay.

90
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,237
Hello.

91
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,396
I'm Detective Decker.

92
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,557
Who would do this to poor June?

93
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,594
Well, I'm hoping that you all
could help me with that.

94
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,712
Um... did any of you hear

95
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,429
or see anything out of
the ordinary this morning?

96
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,712
No. I mean, I heard that
wood chipper going, but...

97
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,151
I didn't know.

98
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,476
And did any of
you know anyone

99
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,756
that would want to hurt June?

100
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,076
No.

101
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,397
Everyone really loved her.

102
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,752
She was very active
in the community.

103
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,600
We just got mani-pedis together.

104
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,356
Mm, sorry.

105
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,752
Ah, thank you
for your help, Maze.

106
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,030
No worries.

107
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,078
This actually gives me
time to brainstorm

108
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,640
a little problem of my own.

109
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,558
Ah.

110
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,150
So, this is for
anything with wings.

111
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,158
- Ooh.
- I grab them like this.

112
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,916
And then I stab 'em
with my blade.

113
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,032
Right.

114
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,471
This beauty...

115
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,115
This is for anything with horns.

116
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,231
Oh, goody.

117
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,794
- So I hook 'em like this.
- Yeah.

118
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,550
And then, bam!

119
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,677
Blade straight to the heart.

120
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,200
Right, I'm just
gonna stop you there.

121
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,630
Do these grisly struggles

122
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,150
always end with you stabbing
a victim with your blade?

123
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,760
My blades were forged in Hell.

124
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,917
How else am I supposed to kill
a celestial being?

125
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,999
Damn. I already stabbed him
with one of your blades.

126
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,670
Well, I wish you
would've told me that

127
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,872
before I hauled all this
out of the basement.

128
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,196
Nothing on Earth.

129
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,197
Nothing from Hell.

130
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,757
I mean, there must be some
way to snuff this candle.

131
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,837
Well...

132
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,832
Decker makes you
killable, right?

133
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:16,792
- Hmm.
- Why don't you

134
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,235
see what's going on there?

135
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,757
Rub some of that on Pierce.

136
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,320
Apples to oranges, Maze.

137
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,556
What's going on there

138
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,031
is just a cruel joke from Dad.

139
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,197
And what's
going on with Pierce isn't?

140
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,358
Your Father

141
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,029
is all about mind games
and loopholes, remember?

142
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,993
Yes, perhaps you're right, Maze.

143
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,274
Maybe I should find out
what makes Pierce vulnerable.

144
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,670
Get inside his head.

145
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,679
Not with the cranial saw.

146
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,317
Well, not yet

147
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,237
anyway.

148
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,237
Why is my couch in
the middle of my office?

149
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,476
Oh, good. You're here.

150
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,750
Please, take a seat.

151
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,039
How are you feeling today?

152
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,478
What are you doing?

153
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,791
Oh, answering a question
with another question.

154
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,434
That's called "evasion."

155
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,112
All right,

156
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,879
and your body language
suggests you're quite upset.

157
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,118
No, I'm just not a fan
of your redecorating.

158
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,909
That's awfully
passive-aggressive

159
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,430
of you, Pierce. Why don't you
tell me how you really feel?

160
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,876
Get out of my office.

161
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,309
Good, good. Anger.

162
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,159
That's called a breakthrough,
yeah.

163
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,517
Oh. Don't worry.

164
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,280
This is a safe place.

165
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,436
Why are you doing this?

166
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,278
Well, how am I supposed

167
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,113
to solve the mystery
of how to kill you

168
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,312
if I don't understand you first?

169
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,233
Your strengths,
your weaknesses.

170
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,272
Because everyone has
a Kryptonite, Lieutenant.

171
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,120
So in other words, you still
have no idea how to kill me?

172
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,637
But... this is the idea.

173
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,600
I'm not a crier.

174
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,950
I'm not a sharer.

175
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,913
So unless you have something
that's case-related,

176
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,955
we're done talking.

177
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,754
And turn my desk around.

178
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,118
Decker.

179
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:09,998
Please tell me
you're working

180
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,515
on something interesting.

181
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,597
Pierce.

182
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,480
Lieutenant, you're still here.

183
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,558
D-Does that mean

184
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,479
you've decided to stay, or...?

185
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,318
Yeah.

186
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,271
At least for now.

187
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,550
Oh, that's great.

188
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,989
That's really, really great.

189
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,793
Two really's? Really?

190
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,111
Yeah, just 'cause...

191
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,156
I have a twist in my case,
and I could use your help.

192
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,953
So the suburban
wood chipper victim,

193
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,514
we recovered a finger,
ran a print.

194
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,759
Turns out June Lee
isn't June Lee.

195
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,030
It's a false identity?

196
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,879
Our vic's real name
is Sandra Jang,

197
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,914
and according to public record,
she died three years ago.

198
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,112
Fascinating. You know,

199
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,040
the lieutenant has a lot
of experience in fake deaths.

200
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,720
You must mean because
I came up through

201
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,797
Missing Persons in Chicago.

202
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,831
Hmm.

203
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,917
Oh, great. We could
really use

204
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,315
your experience on this, then.

205
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,954
Yes, I, too, would love
to learn everything

206
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,429
about your experience.

207
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,391
Sure.

208
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,677
Decker, why don't
you pull

209
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,553
the original death certificate.
There might be something there.

210
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,432
You got it.

211
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,631
I know what you're trying to do.

212
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,911
If you mean solve
a mystery, then yes.

213
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,272
And with you and I working
on this case together,

214
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,312
it'll kill two mysteries
with one stone, hmm?

215
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,318
Emphasis on the
kill, of course.

216
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,550
Oh...

217
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,870
So if we can figure out why

218
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,594
Sandra faked her death
three years ago,

219
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,756
it might point to her killer.

220
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,917
In my experience, people
who fake their own death

221
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,873
are running from
something or someone.

222
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,312
Right, something or someone
that scares them,

223
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,676
makes them feel vulnerable.

224
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,431
Any experience of that in
your own life, Lieutenant?

225
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,920
Sandra definitely
could've been running.

226
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,072
- Check her rap sheet.
- Possession of narcotics

227
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,031
and distribution.

228
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,878
Mm-hmm.

229
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,673
For a gang called
the Korean Power.

230
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,400
Oh, not your
typical gangbanger.

231
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,353
Uh, that's 'cause
she's not a gangbanger.

232
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,710
She's some kind
of a chemist.

233
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,320
Tech unlocked Sandra's laptop,

234
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,876
found, uh, recipes for
synthetic chemical compounds

235
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,952
all filed under
the label "KPOP."

236
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,911
It's a kind of music,

237
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,031
- right?
- Oh, dear.

238
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,799
Poor Daniel,
so behind the times.

239
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,719
K-Pop is a kind of Ecstasy.

240
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,195
It's one of the
best kinds, actually.

241
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,280
Wait, so Sandra wasn't

242
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,240
dealing for the gang,
she was cooking for them.

243
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,313
I wonder if K-Pop
is still on the market?

244
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,354
Oh, well, it was
as of last Tuesday.

245
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,631
It's wonderful stuff.

246
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,877
Yeah, it makes your skin feel
like a baby chinchilla.

247
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,918
And as a nightclub owner,

248
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,117
you might know where
to find some?

249
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,312
Oh, absolutely. Yes, and I'd
be happy to guide you

250
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,476
on your roll, Detective.

251
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,477
Though I would wait
till you have

252
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,551
a day off to recover.

253
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,432
I'm not...

254
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,557
You want to squeeze a dealer.

255
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,110
Right, and work our way up
the chain to the Korean Power,

256
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,276
maybe find Sandra's killer.

257
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,153
There are dozens of homicides
tied to the gang.

258
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,835
Okay, one Ecstasy dealer
coming right up.

259
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,679
You two can meet me
at Lux in an hour.

260
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,234
- Sure.
- Right. Daniel?

261
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,834
- Yeah?
- You can stay.

262
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,240
Oh, here's one.

263
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,397
Some idiot named Ben Simpson.

264
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,876
Absconded in a stolen
ice cream truck.

265
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,395
Six-five.
Aggravated assault

266
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,398
with a blowtorch. Snore.

267
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,237
Don't you clowns have
anything challenging?

268
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,594
What is that?

269
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,716
Do you smell that?

270
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,555
Axe Body Spray.

271
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,917
Oh, hello. Uh, do I know you?

272
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,077
Used to.

273
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,509
I'm Lucifer's... friend.

274
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,037
Oh, so... we're friends?

275
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,789
Hell no.

276
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,430
You were a monstrous bitch

277
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,030
and I hated you.
We were mortal enemies.

278
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,715
Right. I get that a lot.

279
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,755
Yeah, but now
something's different.

280
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,471
It's...

281
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,391
wonderful.

282
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,956
And Lord knows
I could use a distraction.

283
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,160
Oh, well, I have been
trying to make changes.

284
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,551
You know, new leaf and all.

285
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,397
Hasn't been easy,

286
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,109
but I'm glad
it's finally starting to...

287
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,318
come through.

288
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,358
Oh, something's coming
through all right.

289
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,517
Oh.

290
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,554
You smell incredible.

291
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,516
What, um, exactly did you say
our relationship was?

292
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,916
Shh. Don't talk.

293
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,519
I've got to go
hog-tie a fugitive

294
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,359
in an ice cream
truck right now.

295
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,877
But... I will
definitely be back.

296
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,276
Where's Pierce?

297
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,749
He said he was coming.

298
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,792
Well, he's probably
busy at the precinct.

299
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,871
And if you're worried

300
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,912
about him being checked out,
relax.

301
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,072
He's sticking around L.A.
for a while.

302
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,154
I kind of convinced him to stay.

303
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,077
Oh, don't be foolish.

304
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,396
The man's clearly staying
for me.

305
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,512
Turns out we have
quite a bit in common.

306
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,235
Right. So, back to reality,
where we have a case to solve,

307
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,874
where is this dealer
you promised?

308
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,400
Two house specials, please.

309
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,472
Lucifer, you know I don't drink
on the job.

310
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,195
Here you go. Two
house specials.

311
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,553
Your bartender is a drug dealer?

312
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,672
What, you think I hired him
for abs alone?

313
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,111
Where'd you get
the K-Pop?

314
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,673
I get it from
the Korean Power.

315
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,554
Best "E" in town,
or used to be.

316
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,716
Sad but true.

317
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,752
Previously hangover free,
but now in the morning,

318
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,917
your mouth's like
Gandhi's flip-flop.

319
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,310
Hmm, what changed?

320
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,397
Their cook.

321
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,393
The gang used to have
some genius lady chemist,

322
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,590
but I heard she got greedy.

323
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,271
- She stole from the Korean Power?
- Yup.

324
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,712
Big, powerful,
scary, boss dude,

325
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,719
and she pilfered right
from under his nose.

326
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,956
Huh.

327
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,594
Pretty ballsy.

328
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,077
I mean, not that
I would ever...

329
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,191
Yes, yes, get on with it.

330
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,959
So, the boss put a hit
out on her, did he?

331
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,117
Yeah, but her lab blew up
before they could get to her.

332
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,197
Freak accident.

333
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,197
Accident?

334
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,593
Do you know this boss' name
or where we can find him?

335
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,638
Yeah. Brandon Hong.

336
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,479
He likes to hang out at
this one karaoke spot

337
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,750
over on Irolo.

338
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,589
But these guys
don't mess around.

339
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,712
Right, well, mmm...

340
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,434
off we go, Detective.

341
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,835
What? Off we go to where?

342
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,271
To the karaoke parlor,
talk to a gang leader.

343
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,278
Maybe do a duet if you're
feeling adventurous.

344
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,472
We have to verify this testimony
with Vice.

345
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,636
We have to get a warrant,

346
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,035
assemble a SWAT team.

347
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,317
You know, actually plan
to do a gang takedown.

348
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,397
Right. Is that
the sort of thing

349
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,716
the lieutenant
would get involved in?

350
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,475
No, Pierce will not get involved
until we bring him a suspect.

351
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,034
Which is why we should
just go to the parlor

352
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,151
and skip to that part.

353
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,794
Lucifer, this is a
ruthless drug lord

354
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,878
with who knows how
many armed thugs?

355
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,197
You can't just walk in there
with your three-piece suit

356
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,995
"Hello, drug dealers."

357
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,478
I would never do that.

358
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,312
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

359
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,793
- And who are you?
- I'm Lucifer.

360
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,032
Morningstar. But don't worry,
I'm here alone.

361
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,516
- The police raid won't happen for a few more hours.
- Police raid?

362
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,474
Yes. So as you can see,
I'm in a bit of a rush.

363
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,034
Could you point me
to the bigger gun?

364
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,469
- Your boss?
- Get rid of him.

365
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,837
What is it with people
trying to avoid me today?

366
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,518
- I'm only trying to help.
- Help?

367
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,350
- Who?!
- You. The lieutenant.

368
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,153
I'm a giver, damn it.

369
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,989
And now you

370
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,840
are gonna help me.

371
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,272
Mr. Hong,
thank you for coming in.

372
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,757
So, out-out of curiosity,
what... how did you know

373
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,110
that we wanted
to speak to you?

374
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,118
Ah, when you're
in my line of work,

375
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,030
word gets around, you know?

376
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,594
And what line
of work is that?

377
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,677
Oh.

378
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,360
I run the Korean Power.

379
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,318
- Ah.
- Uh, we are a criminal organization

380
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,513
specializing in extortion
and drug dealing.

381
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,310
And, yes.

382
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,313
Sandra Jang used
to cook our Ecstasy.

383
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,152
Oh. And while you're
being so forthcoming

384
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,317
about your felony
distribution,

385
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,314
you care to
confess to murder?

386
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,637
I'd love to help you,

387
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,672
but Sandra's death
wasn't our doing.

388
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,196
What, even though
she stole from you

389
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,754
and faked her own
death to escape?

390
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,514
Yeah, she was
a smart cookie.

391
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,069
I totally fell
for the old

392
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,592
my-lab-exploded-
and-I-died shtick.

393
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,591
But then,

394
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,197
like a voice from beyond,
she called me.

395
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,995
Sandra stole money from
you to start a new life.

396
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,996
Why would she get back
in contact with you?

397
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,311
To pay the money back,
with interest.

398
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,836
She was sick of looking
over her shoulder, I guess.

399
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,396
The suburbs gave her a double
garage and a conscience.

400
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,114
Yeah, I find that
hard to believe.

401
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,430
You and your guys,

402
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,677
you aren't necessarily
known for your kindness.

403
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,634
Thank you.

404
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,191
And you're right.

405
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,675
I never forgave Sandra.

406
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,436
But not for stealing,
for leaving.

407
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,674
When I found out
she was still alive,

408
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,435
I begged her to come back,
but she said no.

409
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,193
Best cook I ever had.

410
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,152
Our profits went down over 40%
when we lost her formula.

411
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,631
So she was worth more
to you alive than dead.

412
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,710
Oh, um...

413
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,078
I've instructed
my guys to cooperate.

414
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,112
You know, alibis and stuff
for the night Sandra was killed.

415
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,830
Whatever the police need.

416
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,480
Okay, you do understand that
even if you weren't involved

417
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,673
in Sandra's death, you have
confessed to several felonies

418
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,234
and we will be arresting you.

419
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,554
Whatever it takes to bring
Sandra's killer to justice.

420
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,911
Right.

421
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,479
That was the most cooperative
arch-criminal I've ever met.

422
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,399
Did you go to that club
on your own?

423
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,831
What did you do to him?

424
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,394
Nothing.
Just made him a deal.

425
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,031
Of course you did.

426
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,640
In exchange
for his cooperation,

427
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,156
I gave him the formula
we found on Sandra's computer.

428
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,278
I mean, a few years in prison
is just a small price to pay

429
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,677
for doubling your profits
with a superior product.

430
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,197
- You can't just hand out random, illicit drug recipes.
- Ah-ah.

431
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,636
Not random,
Detective, the best.

432
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,753
I mean, you don't
want inferior Ecstasy

433
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,440
out there on the streets,
ruining orgies

434
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,393
and dubstep parties,
now, do you?

435
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,910
Rhetorical. My point is,
I got us our suspect,

436
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,117
so can we finally
involve the lieutenant?

437
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,630
We are not involving Pierce
until we check Hong's story.

438
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,991
And if what
he says is true,

439
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,636
he's not even a suspect.

440
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,073
There's one way
to find out.

441
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,591
There is?

442
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,910
Well, what are we
gonna find in there?

443
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,396
We already know about
Sandra's criminal past.

444
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,791
Yes, but what about
her criminal present?

445
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,152
Sandra paid cash for her house,
then two years later,

446
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,955
paid back the Korean mob,
with interest.

447
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,799
Right. How'd she
get that money?

448
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,640
Exactly. You can't do that
on a chemistry teacher's salary.

449
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,876
So, what do we think?

450
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,673
She was hacking into banks?

451
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,556
Or she decided to dust off her
old skill of cooking Ecstasy.

452
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,155
- Right.
- Okay.

453
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,794
Now that we know what
we're looking for,

454
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,600
let's try to find proof
that she was still making

455
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,076
and now selling drugs.

456
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,551
Huh. That's weird.

457
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,989
It's not connecting.

458
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,158
Oh, let me have a look at it.

459
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,158
Oh, Lucifer,
please don't mess with it.

460
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,676
What does this do, anyway?

461
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,076
Stop shaking it.
You're gonna break it.

462
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,710
Ah, you're right, Detective.

463
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,118
It does help to know
what you're looking for.

464
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,912
Are those client lists? Ooh.

465
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,439
One angry one, maybe.

466
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,356
"I know what you're doing.

467
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,755
End it or you're dead."

468
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,032
Ooh.

469
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,839
So, you can take the girl
out of the Ecstasy biz,

470
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,673
but you can't take
the Ecstasy biz out of the girl.

471
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,280
Well, actually,
it's not Ecstasy.

472
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,551
It's more sort of
a homebrew Adderall.

473
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,240
It's very smooth.

474
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,193
Did your partner just admit
to snorting evidence?

475
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,677
The only thing I admit to is
being very focused on this case.

476
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,396
We think Sandra adjusted

477
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,478
her product
to her new environment.

478
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,279
Type-A moms,
high-pressure dads...

479
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,551
And all the Ivy League-bound
brats in between.

480
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,036
And if she was selling,
these death threats suggest

481
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,630
that someone didn't want
those drugs in the neighborhood.

482
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,479
We think she was trying
to determine who sent them.

483
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,239
And maybe looking
got her killed.

484
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,516
All right.
Get close to the neighbors.

485
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,631
See who you can smoke out.

486
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,354
Right. I-I had
the exact same idea,

487
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,517
and there is a house for rent
on Sandra's block.

488
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,757
However, the owner will
only rent to couples.

489
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,394
Great. You and Lucifer
are on it.

490
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,317
No, I'd love to,

491
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,670
but I canvassed the
entire neighborhood.

492
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,200
They know I'm
a cop. Dan, too.

493
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,198
So find another officer
with knowledge of this case

494
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,191
to go undercover.

495
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,477
Oh, don't worry.

496
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,911
We already have.

497
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,911
Hey, hey.

498
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,076
It's the welcome wagon.

499
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,794
Yeah, but not
in the lame way.

500
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,151
We just want
to be the first to say hi

501
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,352
to the, uh, new couple
on the block.

502
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,631
- I'm Brian. This is my wife Anya.
- Hey.

503
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,151
Thank you.
That is so thoughtful.

504
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,237
Honey!

505
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,159
We have guests.

506
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,315
Ah. Right. Brian and
Anya, this is Marc.

507
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,070
Hi. Oh.

508
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,913
Oh.

509
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,196
Mmm.

510
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,557
All right.

511
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,315
What, plastic plates?

512
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,670
What are we, barbarians?

513
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,876
Don't we have any
china in there?

514
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,156
You know this
isn't real, right?

515
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,476
I mea...

516
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,439
You realize this is
just for the case.

517
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,800
This is my chance
to really get to know you.

518
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,559
Pierce, I'm taking
it seriously

519
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,837
and so should you for our cause

520
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,520
and for the case, obviously.

521
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,118
So, let's just get in there
and put on a good show.

522
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,879
Shall we? Just
don't give me

523
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,560
your resting Pierce face.

524
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,871
What face?

525
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,317
So, how did you two
lovebirds meet?

526
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,876
We were high school
sweethearts, actually.

527
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,510
- Aw.
- We were biology partners.

528
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,440
He asked me out while we
were dissecting a crayfish.

529
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,711
My wife.
Oh, the stuff she remembers.

530
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,394
How about you?
How'd you two meet?

531
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,751
- At work.
- Well, um, actually,

532
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,116
we met through my Dad.

533
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,151
Oh!

534
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,476
- So sweet.
- Well, not really.

535
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,194
My Dad's a right bastard.

536
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,950
Oh, right, yes.

537
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,879
Tough, right?
When parents don't approve.

538
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,799
It's true. True.
And my Father would definitely

539
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,191
disapprove of this.

540
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,715
Isn't that right, Marky Marc?

541
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,673
Well, let's not start with that

542
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,513
with these
nice people, Luke.

543
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,599
I'm sorry. Marc loathes
talking about himself.

544
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,950
He's shy.

545
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,270
But don't let that put you off.

546
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,709
I mean, we are
neighbors now, after all.

547
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,354
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

548
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,917
Feel free to ask him...
I mean, us... anything you want.

549
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,230
- Okay.
- All right.

550
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,675
- Shall we?
- Yes.

551
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,276
All right.

552
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,357
Thank you.

553
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,914
Smells delicious.

554
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,630
Ah, I get it.

555
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,835
You know,
when Chloe and I got divorced,

556
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,474
I was so worried about Trixie.

557
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,719
What she would think,
when I would see her.

558
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,032
But I realized,
it's the quality of the time,

559
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,716
not the quantity, you know?

560
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,072
I'm really glad
we did this, Dan.

561
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,954
You're such a nice, normal guy.

562
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,600
Well, thank you, I think.

563
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,391
- I meant that as a compliment.
- Mm-hmm.

564
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,279
I mean, after
the past few months,

565
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,914
normal is exactly
what I need in my life.

566
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,756
Hey, sexy.

567
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,518
What's up, Dan?

568
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,790
Uh, hello.

569
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,956
You two know each other.

570
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,071
Oh, yeah.

571
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,033
We, uh, killed a guy
together once.

572
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,791
Maze...

573
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,997
No.

574
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,556
Uh, what she means is,

575
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,075
we had a killer time,

576
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,396
together, once.

577
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,317
Why are you here, Maze?

578
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,869
Isn't it obvious?

579
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,116
The three of us?

580
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,153
I'm sorry.

581
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,517
Did we...?

582
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,797
Oh, no.

583
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,798
No. No, no, no, no, we didn't.

584
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,354
No. Course n...

585
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,630
But if you wanted to...

586
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,632
um,

587
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,039
now... whatever...

588
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,230
you're into.

589
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,315
I have heard that it's...
can be empowering

590
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,830
'cause I've-I've been reading
this, uh, feminist social...

591
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,230
Well, I'm into it.

592
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,676
If she is.

593
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,475
It's ho... hot.

594
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,952
Oh... uh, can I have
another drink, please?

595
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,516
Thanks.

596
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,391
Milano?

597
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,514
Ooh. They're aren't any nuts
in there, are there?

598
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,279
I-I blow up like a balloon.

599
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,675
Of course, allergies.

600
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,434
- Yeah.
- I didn't think of that.

601
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,712
What makes us vulnerable is
often right under our noses.

602
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,270
Shellfish, maybe?

603
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,152
Huh?

604
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,760
Bees? Latex?

605
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,117
Oh, you know I don't have
any allergies, sweetie.

606
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,835
Let's talk about this
lovely community.

607
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,275
You seem so tightknit.

608
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,119
Yes, yes. It must
have been devastating

609
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,233
when that poor woman was found
ground up like hamburger meat.

610
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,511
Our Realtor told us.

611
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,353
Yeah, it was horrible.
Huge loss. We're...

612
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,280
we're kind of one
big family around here.

613
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,960
Well, most of us, anyway.

614
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,277
Some of the neighbors
can be a little uptight.

615
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,080
Ah, come on, babe, the guys
don't want to hear about that.

616
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,674
Right? We're here
to welcome 'em.

617
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,475
- Hear about what?
- The Neighborhood Watchdog.

618
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,514
Someone has been writing notes
and terrorizing the block.

619
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,633
Uh, "Trim your
hedges, or else."

620
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,872
"Stop using non-organic
weed killer,

621
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,070
or I'll make you drink it."

622
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,630
This Watchdog seems rather
preoccupied with gardening.

623
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,197
No. People have been getting
notes for all kinds of things.

624
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,551
Uh, loud music, parking,

625
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,194
holiday decor.

626
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,235
It's like Martha Stewart
and the Terminator had a baby.

627
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,200
Any idea who
this "Watchdog" is?

628
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,715
No, actually.

629
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,274
Well, I suppose
we all have our mysteries.

630
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,358
Don't we? Speaking of,

631
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,710
wouldn't you two
like to know more

632
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,320
about this little enigma?

633
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,311
- Hmm?
- Well,

634
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,880
this has been nice.

635
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,275
Um, but remember,
we have to get up early

636
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,715
for that thing tomorrow morning.

637
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,356
Uh...

638
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,629
No idea what you're
talking about, darling.

639
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,395
Here you go.

640
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,714
I thought you went
to the bathroom.

641
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,871
No.

642
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,074
I'm sorry, I just...
needed a few minutes.

643
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,800
Truth is, I've...
been through hell lately.

644
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,595
That's it.

645
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,760
No wonder
I wanted you.

646
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,791
That's it.

647
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,878
I can smell it on you.

648
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,399
The pain, the torment.

649
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,394
What, it's that obvious?

650
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,431
Girl,

651
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,915
it is all over you.

652
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,873
I guess I thought I was doing

653
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,719
a better job of covering it up.

654
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,600
You see, um...

655
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,076
I died recently,

656
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:53,071
or... well, almost... died.

657
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,590
And since then,
it's been a struggle

658
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,480
to get my life back
to some semblance of normal.

659
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,876
That's what you want?

660
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,152
Normal.

661
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,114
Yes. Please, God, yes.

662
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,276
Well,

663
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,914
I am definitely not God.

664
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,150
Or normal.

665
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,840
So, guess I'm out.

666
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,630
Oh, y-you are?

667
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,751
I just...

668
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,352
I just told you
my deepest secret.

669
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,831
Yeah.

670
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,791
Sorry.

671
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,116
I thought it was you
I was attracted to,

672
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,795
but turns out,
it's just my old life.

673
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,313
And I'm... not sure
if I want to go back there.

674
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,150
Hey, but Dan's probably
still into it, though.

675
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,671
Hmm.

676
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,790
Thanks so much for dinner, bye.

677
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,030
Bye, have a good one.

678
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,477
This Watchdog weirdo seems
promising.

679
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,553
And those notes sound
just like the one we found

680
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,910
in Sandra's stash.

681
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,672
I just can't imagine someone
so obsessed

682
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,155
with obeying the rules
of suburbia.

683
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,436
Where do you think you're going?

684
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,753
I cook, you clean, remember?

685
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,676
Domesticity can have
a strange effect on people.

686
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,200
Question is, now,

687
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,797
how do we draw out
this Watchdog?

688
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,033
Well, don't you worry
about that, Detective.

689
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:08,912
Trust me,

690
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,869
no one's a worse neighbor
than the Devil.

691
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,437
Lucifer.

692
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,960
What, are you
building something?

693
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,911
Yes.

694
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,589
Our reputation as the most
annoying neighbors on the block.

695
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,555
It's 4:00 a.m.

696
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,080
Maybe we can finish this
in the morning.

697
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,356
"We"?

698
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,320
You're barely involved.

699
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,431
You know, I-I...

700
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,279
I thought this was
supposed to be about you and I

701
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,834
spending time together.

702
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,794
No. No, no. This is about
catching a killer.

703
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,119
Guys, someone's approaching
the house.

704
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,437
You just need to open up to me.

705
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,279
- Guys?
- That won't solve anything!

706
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,436
- Guys, heads up.
- Everyone has their Achilles' heel.

707
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,074
- Someone's approaching.
- We just need to find yours.

708
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,157
Right now, mine is you.

709
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,192
Guys. Damn it.

710
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,315
We've been through this.

711
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,795
Feel like I
don't know you.

712
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,639
What are you talking about?

713
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,519
LAPD. Don't move.

714
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,637
Oh.

715
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,591
Hello.

716
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,154
Have you come
for your casserole dish?

717
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,471
Hands up.

718
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,757
It's not illegal to hold people up

719
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,150
to our community standards.

720
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,635
The police should be
thanking me.

721
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,715
I'm out there every night
helping you guys.

722
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,158
Helping? Is that what you were
doing when you killed June Lee?

723
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,352
What? I di... I didn't hurt June.

724
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,279
I understand.
You're out there,

725
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,312
you're trying to keep
your neighborhood clean.

726
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,432
And then June's there,
dealing drugs.

727
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,149
Wait, you think I was trying to
get June to stop dealing drugs?

728
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,311
I was her best customer.

729
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,789
You were buying her Adderall?

730
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,150
Uh, yeah.

731
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,629
Me and half the block.

732
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,512
How do you think
I had the energy

733
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,951
to be out there
every night, all night?

734
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,152
I mean, June changed my life.

735
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,198
I learned Mandarin.

736
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,638
I built a deck around my...
I-I lost 40 pounds.

737
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,671
Okay.

738
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,631
So you're saying you didn't
write that threatening note?

739
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,479
No, that's not even my
handwrit... look, look at it.

740
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,512
It's so sloppy. Of course,
what do you expect from someone

741
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,350
clueless enough to put a whole
body into a wood chipper? Wha...

742
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,471
I-I mean,

743
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,557
saw before you mulch.

744
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,075
Everyone knows that.

745
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,750
Thanks.

746
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,314
Ah. Now, he would know

747
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,671
not to put onion skins
down the garbage disposal.

748
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,200
You know,
why wouldn't I put onion skins

749
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,396
down the garbage disposal?

750
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,551
They're garbage.

751
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,194
- They're compost.
- You know what?

752
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,920
Thank God
that this marriage is over.

753
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,236
Guys.

754
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,750
Brian's not our killer.

755
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,553
But your cover is still intact

756
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,035
and I have
a new plan.

757
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,476
You lovebirds ready
to go back to suburbia?

758
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,752
Ah.

759
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,390
Till death do us part,

760
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,272
darling.

761
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,318
Well, how's this angle,
Detective?

762
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,037
A little to the right,
and make sure

763
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,640
you put the guest book
where I can see it.

764
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,030
Don't worry, Decker, we'll be
checking handwriting

765
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,879
as we go along,
I just hope people show up

766
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,560
after Lucifer's antics.

767
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,440
Ah, I've simply piqued
their curiosity.

768
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,559
Oh, we... we'd like
everyone to sign.

769
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,637
Please.

770
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,559
Makes it more personal.

771
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,032
Um, why is that hummus so
far away from the crudités?

772
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,114
- What?
- Everyone knows

773
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,676
you put the snacks next
to the dipping sauce. I...

774
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,109
Why do I feel like I'm
the only one putting

775
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,276
any effort into anything?

776
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,278
Probably because you're making
everything about you.

777
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,432
Me?

778
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,835
In case you've forgotten,
I am doing this for you.

779
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,440
- Really?
- Yes, really.

780
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,790
And if you're not committed,
then there's no point

781
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,195
to us even being here.

782
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,596
The only reason I'm here
is because I have to be.

783
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,076
- Ah.
- Everything else is just an empty promise.

784
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,191
You have no idea
what you're doing.

785
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,311
I beg your pardon?

786
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,914
You say you're
a man of your word.

787
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,917
But you're not.

788
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,080
Can't believe
he just said that.

789
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,430
Excuse me!

790
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,910
Lucifer.

791
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,356
Lucifer.

792
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,191
What the hell are you guys
doing back there?

793
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,875
This is a sting... you can't
just leave in the middle of it.

794
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,878
I just can't be
around him right now.

795
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,879
Lucifer, sometimes
when you go undercover,

796
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,834
things get real, people
get on each other's nerves.

797
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:18,871
But here's the thing:

798
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,639
you can't change
your partner.

799
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,115
Tell me about it.

800
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,836
Okay... as hard as
it is right now,

801
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,112
I need you to stick it out
until the job's done.

802
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,791
Pierce is never gonna be
the guy who cares about

803
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,639
where the hummus is,
or whatever.

804
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,993
But he does care
about what matters.

805
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,840
Like solving this case.

806
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,997
He can't do it without you,
and he knows that.

807
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,359
- Does he?
- Yes, he does.

808
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,199
So, please,
get back in there

809
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,319
and get those signatures.

810
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,030
Right.

811
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,315
You moved the nachos.

812
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,872
Well, yeah, I didn't want
anyone to spill salsa...

813
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,480
Into the macaroni.

814
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,760
Wasn't sure
you were coming back.

815
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,280
I made you a promise.

816
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,880
And I am a man
of my word,

817
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,520
no matter what
you may think.

818
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,200
I may have overreacted.

819
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,236
I'm sorry.

820
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,596
Thank you.

821
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,031
But...

822
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,273
you were right
about one thing.

823
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,673
I don't have
all the answers.

824
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,354
But I hope that

825
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,751
we can find them...
together.

826
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,471
I mean, after all, you may be
the only person on this planet

827
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,797
who truly understands me.

828
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,309
I'm not ready
to give up on that.

829
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,032
Aw...

830
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,994
Wow. Cover officially restored.

831
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,952
Okay, now can we please
check the book for signatures?

832
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,117
Forgive me.

833
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,590
Ah, Marcie, uh,

834
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,836
some words for the chef?

835
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:32,917
Ooh, I've got mustard on...

836
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,236
Some words for the chef!

837
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,951
Lovely. Would you mind
working the word "pervert"

838
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,190
in there somewhere?

839
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,439
Could you address it
to "scheming whore"?

840
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,718
Just a little private
joke for Marc.

841
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,314
Brian said he signed
for us both already.

842
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,352
Well, Marc and I would like
everyone to write

843
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,199
- a little message, if you don't mind.
- Oh.

844
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,993
Okay. Uh, let's see.

845
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,192
Actually, um,
I think it's, uh...

846
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,516
I think it's time
for us to go, dear.

847
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,876
But we just got here.

848
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,036
Uh, yeah, I know,
but we really

849
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,472
need to go.

850
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,473
Brian, please.
What-wh-what are you doing?

851
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,352
Just put the book down.

852
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,431
- Brian!
- Brian...

853
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,000
- Brian, please...
- Just a little message.

854
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,316
No, no, no, I know
what you guys are

855
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,550
- trying to do here.
- Brian.

856
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,831
Hey, Brian, just relax, okay.

857
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,837
Just calm down.

858
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,076
Take it easy.

859
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,389
Everybody get back!

860
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,513
Go on, get back.
All right, yeah? Get back.

861
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,989
Brian. Bri...

862
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,037
We're leaving.

863
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,400
Thanks.
It was great.

864
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,318
- What about hedge trimmers?
- Tried it. Didn't work.

865
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,920
- Put it down, Brian.
- Uh...

866
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,636
I didn't want
to hurt anybody.

867
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,112
I know. And I know you don't
want to hurt anyone right now.

868
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,760
You're not a killer,
you're just protecting one.

869
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,389
Brian, what is she
talking about?

870
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,672
You wrote the threatening
note to June.

871
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,720
We accused your husband,
but he must have

872
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,912
recognized your handwriting
when we showed it to him.

873
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,671
That's why he didn't want
you signing the guest book.

874
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:03,872
You know?

875
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,511
How could you do something
so stupid, babe?

876
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,315
I'm not stupid.

877
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,716
I know that you and June
were having an affair.

878
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,434
- No.
- I saw you

879
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,960
sneaking around with her,

880
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,514
and then you lost
all that weight.

881
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,313
I thought I would
just write her

882
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,159
one of those notes
to scare her off,

883
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,432
but then you still kept
sneaking out every night.

884
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,790
And then you went
and confronted her.

885
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,073
Yes, but then she
just kept denying it,

886
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,953
and I got so,

887
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,438
so angry I just... shoved her,
and then she...

888
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,114
she hit her head.

889
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,437
But I d...
I didn't mean to kill her.

890
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,915
I just...

891
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,795
I just didn't want you
to leave me.

892
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,359
But he wasn't having an affair.

893
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,438
June was his drug dealer.

894
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,437
It's true.

895
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,400
I was buying pills from her
to help me lose weight.

896
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,799
For you, so that I could
go back to being the guy

897
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,872
that you fell in love
with in high school.

898
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,794
I didn't want <i>you</i> to leave <i>me.</i>

899
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,239
I'm so sorry
I doubted you.

900
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,790
I just... I don't know what
I would do without you.

901
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,320
Neither do I. Oh...

902
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,470
Okay, show's over.

903
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,359
Yeah, I suppose there's
some cold comfort

904
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,193
in them being
arrested together.

905
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,395
At least they've got each other.

906
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,430
Yeah, they do.

907
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,516
Dan?

908
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,997
Hey.

909
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,793
I just wanted to
come by and apologize

910
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,156
about the other night.

911
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,958
You have nothing
to apologize for.

912
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,591
I absolutely, completely
blame Maze.

913
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,191
That girl is a freak.

914
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,357
She is odd.

915
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,475
But she also made me realize
some things about myself.

916
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,439
Maze isn't
the only odd one.

917
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,829
I'm a mess.

918
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,197
All that talk about
feeling normal again?

919
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,830
Wishful thinking.

920
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,800
I have a long road ahead.

921
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,592
You know, whatever
this is that we have,

922
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,233
it has never been normal.

923
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,760
And I decided that
I just have to own that.

924
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,560
I like you, Charlotte.

925
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,077
You are unlike anyone
I have ever met.

926
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,156
So if you need time
to sort some things out,

927
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,316
I can wait.

928
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,711
You're worth it.

929
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,678
So, I heard
the divorce went through.

930
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,439
What are you gonna do
with your half of Lux?

931
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,313
Very funny, Decker.

932
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,478
What's up?

933
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,637
Some of us from the precinct
are going down to the Paddock

934
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,910
for beers after work,

935
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,349
and I thought
you might want to join,

936
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,596
if you don't have
anything better to do.

937
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,996
I don't think I should.

938
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,359
Oh, yeah, no big deal.

939
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,916
Just, like I said,
a lot of people are going, so...

940
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,511
Listen, Chloe,

941
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,119
you and I, it's not a good idea.

942
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,391
Oh, I wasn't suggesting
anything romantic at all.

943
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,199
- I just...
- Listen, it's just

944
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,200
we deal with death
every day,

945
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,311
and...

946
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,271
everybody's gonna die.

947
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,914
Someday you'll die,
and I just...

948
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,110
Yeah.

949
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,151
Losing your brother,
it's still

950
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,680
really affecting you, huh?

951
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,398
Understatement
of the millennia.

952
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,232
I understand.
I do.

953
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,357
And about tonight,
it's not a big deal.

954
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:36,997
But...

955
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,272
just so I know
that I'm not crazy, um...

956
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,390
in the surveillance van,

957
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,879
when I asked you
to stay in L.A.,

958
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,432
we did have a moment
there, yeah?

959
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,516
We did share a moment.

960
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,030
Which is why I had
to tell you

961
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,436
that I'm not
relationship material.

962
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,751
Mm.

963
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,917
Well, for what it's worth,

964
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,115
it was a really nice moment.

965
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,518
I was really looking forward
to sleeping

966
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,439
far away from you tonight.

967
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,029
Oh, it is good.

968
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,998
I've finally got
you figured out.

969
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,351
- Really?
- Mm, yes.

970
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,712
You're terrified of letting
someone get close to you

971
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,912
'cause you know they'll
eventually leave you.

972
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,390
You'll outlive them.

973
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,272
You want to die because

974
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,920
you don't want to
be alone anymore.

975
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,916
Yeah, well, duh.

976
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,999
- What's your point?
- If we're gonna kill you...

977
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,638
...then we have got
to do it together.

978
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,632
Is that right?

979
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:55,752
Mm.

980
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,794
You see, I don't think you've
been spending time with me

981
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,719
trying to figure out
how to kill me.

982
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,517
I think you want
to spend time

983
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,836
with someone who's been
screwed by your Dad

984
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,400
as much as you've been.

985
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,998
<i>You</i> are the one that
doesn't want to be alone.

986
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,080
I suppose one might
call us friends now.

987
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,191
And it is nice to have
a friend who can relate.

988
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,677
I get you.

989
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,075
No, you don't.

990
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,278
But you've been
on the earth, what, five years?

991
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,517
You'll see.

992
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,793
It's hard not
to get attached.

993
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,118
Okay. Okay.

994
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,119
So we both have some issues
that we need to work through.

995
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,829
But if we're gonna
get revenge on Dad,

996
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,838
we've got to be committed.

997
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,717
I've already married you.

998
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,559
I'm not sure how much
more committed I could be.

999
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,193
True. True.

1000
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,834
But there are
so many things

1001
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,514
that we never got to try.

1002
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,275
Fine.

1003
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,919
Go get the chain saw.

1004
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,000
Oh, I thought you'd never ask.
