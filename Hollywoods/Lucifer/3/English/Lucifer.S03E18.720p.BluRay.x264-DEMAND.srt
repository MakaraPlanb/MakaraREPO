1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,515
<i>- Previously on</i> Lucifer...
- Mama's gone?

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,995
Yes. I mean, she says

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,032
...goodbye forever.
She loves you very much.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,396
I'm missing time.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,716
It's like someone else

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,240
was living my life.

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,999
The one man I've cared about...

8
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,640
I still gave him up.

9
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,320
That's how much I care
about our friendship.

10
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,949
Go... to...

11
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:18,997
Hell.

12
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,151
In the surveillance van,

13
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,476
when I asked you
to stay in L.A.,

14
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,114
we did have a moment there.

15
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,356
Which is why I had
to tell you that I'm not

16
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,710
<i>relationship material.</i>

17
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,838
You're terrified of letting
someone get close to you

18
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,269
'cause you know they'll
eventually leave you.

19
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,039
- You'll outlive them.
- You got to have faith,

20
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,879
<i>because life can surprise you.</i>

21
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,753
<i>Now, if my brother, the Devil,
can have that...</i>

22
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,030
Maybe I can, too.

23
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,191
So, what brings
you here?

24
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,551
Work.

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,960
What you working on?

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,231
A case.

27
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,071
Well, you want to take a break
and buy me a drink?

28
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,715
Not really, no.

29
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,436
Got to admit.

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,677
Watching these women try
to get your attention...

31
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,350
best part of my night.

32
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,391
I don't know what I'm gonna do

33
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,960
when you finally say yes
to one of them.

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,350
Never gonna say yes.

35
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,791
Oh, yeah? 'Cause somebody
already stole your heart?

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,354
It's just not
in the cards for me.

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,235
We got to go, Detective.

38
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,593
Um... duty calls.

39
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,191
All right.

40
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,715
Two more bodies were just found
in Griffith Park holding hands.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,673
Looks like the Broken Hearts
Killer strikes again.

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,320
Stop calling him that.

43
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,110
Why? What's the problem?

44
00:01:59,320 --> 00:01:59,912
Because you never know

45
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,032
when something stupid
like that's gonna stick.

46
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,993
Come on. That'll never stick.

47
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,511
Wow. Last night was so...

48
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,355
- That was quite the concert.
- Yes!

49
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,596
I can't remember the last time

50
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,234
I went to a show
that was so, uh...

51
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,679
- Loud.
- So loud! I still can't hear anything.

52
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,559
They totally boned.

53
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,276
Miss Lopez,
please don't be vulgar.

54
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,994
The detective
doesn't... bone.

55
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,076
Seriously, do you not
see the epic fireworks?

56
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,312
There's more chemistry
over there than in my lab.

57
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,432
And they just went to
the Axara concert.

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,320
It's a natural aphrodisiac.

59
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,398
Well, if you're a pimply
millennial, perhaps,

60
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,239
but the detective
is a grown woman

61
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,510
with sophisticated tastes.

62
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,311
Trust me, she's not
so easily won over.

63
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,230
Oh, my God.

64
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,917
You are totally
freaking out right now.

65
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,278
What?

66
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,796
About this coming
between you and Chloe.

67
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,593
Don't be preposterous.

68
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,871
I'm not freaking out
about anything.

69
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,549
It's okay. Okay, I-I get it.

70
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,752
You're afraid that

71
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,872
they're gonna start spending
all their time together.

72
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,510
You know, joining each
other at crime scenes,

73
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,120
bantering over
dead bodies.

74
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,039
And where does that
leave you, right?

75
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,630
I assure you, Miss Lopez,
that is the least of my worries.

76
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,872
The chemistry in
there is just a...

77
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,110
a flash in the pan.

78
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,470
- Exactly.
- Mm.

79
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,679
A completely hot
flash in the pan.

80
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,036
Lucifer, what you and Chloe
have is on a total other level.

81
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,597
Exactly. Nothing
is changing.

82
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,914
Nope. Nope.

83
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,871
<i>Anyhow, I just...</i>

84
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,600
I wanted
to say thank you for coming.

85
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,359
I just...
I had a really great time.

86
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,556
So when can we do it again?

87
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,592
Um... uh...

88
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,916
a con... a concert, or...?

89
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,714
I was thinking
something quieter.

90
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,394
Maybe dinner?

91
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,433
I know a pretty good Italian
place if you're into that.

92
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,880
Uh, I mean, I love... Italian,

93
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,309
but, uh,

94
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,715
weren't you saying
that you didn't want to...?

95
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,076
Hey, Chloe, I just
wanted to, uh...

96
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,871
I'm sorry.

97
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,237
I didn't mean
to interrupt.

98
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,920
- My bad.
- No, no. You're good.

99
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,156
We were just, um...

100
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,510
Just...

101
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,231
What's up?

102
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,671
Well, uh, we have a case...
double murder.

103
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,791
Some couple found
in a convertible

104
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,229
at a lookout off Griffith Park.

105
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,914
Super creepy scene,
by the sounds of it.

106
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,679
Mm-hmm. Okay,
I'll be right there.

107
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,596
Espinoza, could I get
a copy of that file?

108
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,197
Sure thing.

109
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,200
What would I like?

110
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,232
Well...

111
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,115
sometimes the answer
to that is not so simple, is it?

112
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,916
I mean, I would like to know
what my father's next test is.

113
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,998
I feel pretty confident
that I passed the last one,

114
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,079
but... what's next?

115
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,959
And what am I supposed
to do in between?

116
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,311
Or is that, in itself,
a test?

117
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,237
Okay.

118
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,360
How about a large mocha
with extra whip?

119
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,553
Sure. Sure.

120
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,432
- Okay.
- Okay.

121
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,597
Large Americano
for Charlotte.

122
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,355
Mom? Mom?!

123
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,190
I can't believe
it's you.

124
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,357
Uh, Lucifer said
that you were gone,

125
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,358
that-that he used
the Flaming Sword

126
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,995
and sent you into
another universe.

127
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,360
What are you doing back here?

128
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,037
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

129
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,035
Uh...

130
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,431
no.

131
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,397
No, you don't.

132
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,875
I, um... I'm sorry.

133
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,150
I thought you were
someone else.

134
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,990
No, wait.
You know Lucifer,

135
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,398
so you do know me.

136
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,396
What did you mean,
a "Flaming Sword"?

137
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,349
I'm really sorry,
but I have to go.

138
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,678
For the record,
Detective, I'd like you to note

139
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,071
that I haven't once asked you
about your evening with Pierce.

140
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,760
I realize
it's none of my business.

141
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,871
You're right. It's not.

142
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,753
But Miss Lopez thinks
you boned.

143
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,677
What?

144
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,155
Her words, not mine.

145
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,999
I, uh, simply thought
you should know.

146
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,919
We just went
to a concert, you know?

147
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,792
It's not a big deal.

148
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,480
Right. That's what
Dr. Linda said, too.

149
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,513
Well, for having this
not be your business,

150
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,313
you're certainly talking
to a lot of people about it.

151
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,358
I know. I just wish
people would stop prying.

152
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,119
But regardless, I've
come to the conclusion

153
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,119
that no matter what happens
with you and Pierce,

154
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,630
you and I are
partners, Detective,

155
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,115
and nothing can
come between that.

156
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,629
Prepare yourselves, people.

157
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,479
This is a different
kind of case.

158
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,193
Lieutenant,
what brings you here?

159
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,274
I had a gut feeling
about this case.

160
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,189
I wanted to see
if I was right.

161
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,869
As much as we appreciate your
digestive feelings, Lieutenant,

162
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,833
the detective and I have this
utterly under control,

163
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,157
- so, if you don't mind...
- I don't mind at all.

164
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,995
Ella, what do we have?

165
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,754
Meet Robbie Matthews
and Rachel White.

166
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,360
Looks like they were
drugged unconscious,

167
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,950
and then someone literally
smashed their chests in.

168
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,156
Do we know
how they were drugged?

169
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,829
Uh, best guess, maybe the killer
used some form of anesthetic.

170
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,036
Liquid or aerosol.

171
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,516
And then crushed their ribs,
their sternum.

172
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,553
And finally, their hearts.

173
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,831
Well, it's not hard to figure
out what the desire was here.

174
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,719
Well, the killer was clearly
trying to send a message.

175
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,031
That he couldn't stand
this couple's relationship.

176
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,078
So, what?

177
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,760
We think maybe
she had a jealous stalker?

178
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,917
Or an angry ex.
We need to talk to anyone

179
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,440
who had a problem
with this relationship.

180
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,750
See, we've got this,
Lieutenant.

181
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,189
No need to mess
with success.

182
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,030
Which one of them was married?

183
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,680
Well, no weddings rings, so,
neither of them, obviously.

184
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,678
But good on you
for participating.

185
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,679
Has anyone checked their
chest cavities yet?

186
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,593
What? Why would we do that?

187
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,238
In the '50s, there was
a guy named Clark Hoffman.

188
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,510
He was known for
making his victims

189
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,040
swallow their wedding rings.

190
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,634
Right, the Broken Hearts Killer.

191
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,717
By the time they caught him,

192
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,673
he'd killed seven
cheating couples in L.A.

193
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,434
His crime scenes were
about as gruesome as this.

194
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,597
Wow, you really know
a lot about this.

195
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,109
The cop who solved
the case

196
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,874
was an old mentor of mine.

197
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,794
And didn't Hoffman die
a few days ago in prison?

198
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,559
Making him a particularly
useless addition

199
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,472
to this conversation.

200
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,632
Unless his death
inspired a copycat.

201
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,309
Or maybe they're using this
as an MO to throw us off.

202
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,678
Thank you.

203
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,152
- I hope that's all it is.
- All righty,

204
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,113
guess we'll get out
the old chest spreader

205
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,834
and go fishing
for some wedding rings.

206
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,391
Or, according to their
social media profile,

207
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,751
Rachel was single,
and Robbie was married.

208
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,553
We need to talk
to the spouse ASAP.

209
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,912
Yep.
Don't worry.

210
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,954
Nothing's changing.

211
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,238
- Nothing at all.
- Hmm.

212
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,679
Okay, Monkey,
you grab the backpack,

213
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,274
I'll grab the... brownies,

214
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,516
and we'll get you to school.

215
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,480
Maze, are you home?

216
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,595
Hey...

217
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,831
Daddy...

218
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,231
- there's a man in my bed.
- What?

219
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,671
And he smells bad.

220
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,393
I see you found the band.

221
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,236
Go wait in the car.

222
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,600
Seriously,
what were you thinking

223
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,315
letting a drunken rocker
sleep in Trixie's bed?

224
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,636
I was thinking
he was too drunk

225
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,513
to make it up the stairs
to Chloe's bed.

226
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,797
What's the big deal?

227
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,229
The big deal, Maze,

228
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,874
is that you live
with a nine-year-old.

229
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,591
It's not okay.

230
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,072
Ooh... did I make Dan mad?

231
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,310
Why are you...

232
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,034
Are you going through
something lately?

233
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,959
Other than the band, no.

234
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,872
Fine.

235
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,072
Whatever.
Clean up.

236
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,840
I don't want to have to
tell Chloe about this.

237
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,993
She has enough
on her plate right now.

238
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,557
You know, there
are some things

239
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,160
I could tell Chloe, too.

240
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,359
Like what?

241
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,670
Like...

242
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,598
remember when we had
a guy killed?

243
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,591
Yeah.

244
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,517
That was fun.

245
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,236
Seems we both have things
we'd rather Chloe not know.

246
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,435
Look, I don't know what's
going on with you right now,

247
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,233
but whatever it is...
figure it out.

248
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,234
Emma Mathews just
got brought in.

249
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,519
And Emma Matthews is...

250
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,511
The victim's wife.

251
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,910
Right.
Yes, of course.

252
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,237
Well, mustn't keep the
murderous lady waiting.

253
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,357
Mind if I join?

254
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,670
You sure?
You don't have to.

255
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,075
I know.
I want to.

256
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,314
Great.
The more the merrier.

257
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,751
Uh... I know what
you're doing.

258
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,360
I'm getting ready to
question a suspect.

259
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,710
And I hate to break it
to you, Cain,

260
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,149
but there's only
room for one immortal

261
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:36,992
in the detective's life,

262
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,436
- and that position's already been filled.
- By you.

263
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,639
The detective and I are a team...
a package deal, if you will.

264
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,150
Sadly, there's just no room
for a third.

265
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,709
And I don't understand why

266
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,434
you're trying to spend time
with her anyway.

267
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,994
What happened to the whole
wanting to die thing?

268
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,111
I had a change of heart.

269
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,431
I'm sorry if I upset you.

270
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,676
I didn't think you two
were a thing.

271
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,151
We're not a thing.

272
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,756
We're partners.

273
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,076
Well, if that's all it is,
then you've got nothing

274
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,111
to worry about, do you?

275
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,791
Wait...

276
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,912
Right.

277
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,396
Yeah.

278
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,230
Fine, fine.

279
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,073
I prefer standing anyway.

280
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,752
Emma,

281
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,679
four months ago, your
husband reported that

282
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,759
you slashed his tires.
Then two months ago,

283
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,600
neighbors saw you throwing
rocks through his window.

284
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,950
And then just last month,

285
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,839
you were seen threatening
him with a bat.

286
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,356
Can you explain that?

287
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,116
Look, I'm not proud
of what happened.

288
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,990
But I was upset.

289
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,677
I just found out
Robbie was cheating on me.

290
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,036
Well, completely understandable.

291
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,594
I mean, what else
are you supposed to do

292
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,674
when some parasite inserts
himself into your relationship?

293
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,839
So is that why you did this?

294
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,270
What?

295
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,755
Is this for real?

296
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,631
I... admit I hated Rachel,

297
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,433
but I would never hurt Robbie.

298
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,599
I-I may have gone
a little nuts

299
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,473
when I learned
he was cheating, but...

300
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,832
after the courts forced me
into therapy,

301
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,400
we started talking.

302
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,831
We chose to divorce amicably.

303
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,275
Oh, God.

304
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,311
I can't believe he's dead.

305
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,715
This is preposterous.

306
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,394
Do you really
expect us to believe

307
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,479
that you were okay with someone
tearing you two apart?

308
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,114
- It's the truth.
- Does the name

309
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,915
Clark Hoffman
mean anything to you?

310
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,515
Who?

311
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,750
I know we're gonna check out
her alibi,

312
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,155
but my gut tells me
to believe her.

313
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,914
Oh, please. Just 'cause
she spouted some drivel

314
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,674
about conscious uncoupling?

315
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,758
Because she has no idea
who the Broken Hearts Killer is

316
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,440
and she has no motive
to go after Robbie.

317
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,869
Well, she's
obviously lying,

318
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,673
about her relationships
and the murders.

319
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,200
Please tell me I'm not
the only one who sees that.

320
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,760
- Detective?
- I think we can't take

321
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,997
- Emma's word at face value.
- Mm-hmm.

322
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,560
We don't have to.
Another couple

323
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,876
was just found dead
holding hands.

324
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,480
This time
at a cheap motel.

325
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,790
The Safari Inn.

326
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,433
This isn't just
a lovers' quarrel.

327
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,551
No, you're right.

328
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,955
The copycat's
just getting started.

329
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,230
Lieutenant, we need you
on this case.

330
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,477
And I normally love threesomes.

331
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,235
Meet Mary Lee
and Dennis Horn.

332
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,200
Just like our first lovers,
they were drugged unconscious

333
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,193
before the killer took something
really big and really hard

334
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,231
and literally...

335
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,960
- Bludgeoned their hearts.
- Mm-hmm.

336
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,675
And then moved them here
and staged this whole scene.

337
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,156
And just like the other victims,
one of them's married.

338
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,760
She's got a tan line
on her ring finger.

339
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,596
We actually
ended up finding

340
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,916
a wedding ring inside
the first victim,

341
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,675
so good bet we'll
probably find one here, too.

342
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,155
Any other evidence?

343
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,629
More like
lack thereof.

344
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,194
Place was wiped clean,

345
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,470
just like the
first crime scene.

346
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,319
I mean, this
killer, you guys,

347
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,354
whoever he...
or she... is,

348
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,352
total pro.

349
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,755
Well, Emma's alibi checks out.

350
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,917
There's no obvious connection
between the couples.

351
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,157
I just wonder how the killer's
picking his targets.

352
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,797
Well, Lieutenant,

353
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,992
as our resident
Broken Hearts expert,

354
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,476
wouldn't you say it's time to
enlighten us with your wisdom?

355
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,476
No one knew how the original
killer chose his victims.

356
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,673
I guess we just got lucky
we caught him when we did.

357
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,791
"We"?

358
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,877
The LAPD.

359
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,514
We don't have time
for luck. We got to get back

360
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,915
to the station,
figure out a connection

361
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,435
between these victims.

362
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,790
Yes, I couldn't agree more,
Detective.

363
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,560
After all,
the sooner we finish this case,

364
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,554
the sooner things
can <i>all</i> go back to normal.

365
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:20,952
Oof.

366
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,397
Gnarly.

367
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,360
You're
burning my table.

368
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,317
Hmm?

369
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,199
Oh, I'm sorry.

370
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,591
Um...

371
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,752
You don't ever take
a moment to stop, do you?

372
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,191
No rest for the wicked,

373
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,397
so no rest for me, either.

374
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,438
I've got you
figured out, you know.

375
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,511
You do, huh?

376
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,276
You could work anywhere...

377
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,709
your office, your home,

378
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,798
but you choose
to work in this bar.

379
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:00,998
Why?

380
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,156
I like a stiff drink?

381
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,436
Because you don't actually
want to be alone.

382
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,040
Then why do I sit by myself?

383
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,431
Maybe you feel like you
don't deserve the company.

384
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,797
Well, look who's
a detective now.

385
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,109
So, what are you
spending all these

386
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,794
lonesome hours on, anyway?

387
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,195
I'm working on trying
to find the guy

388
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,629
who kills cheating couples.

389
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,030
The Broken Hearts Killer?

390
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,000
That's what they call him.

391
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,676
Six crime scenes,
not one shred of evidence.

392
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,712
It's like I'm looking
for clues that don't exist.

393
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,556
It never ceases to amaze me,

394
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,035
the lengths people will go to

395
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,919
when they want to make
something just right.

396
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:35,997
What do you mean?

397
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,150
Like when people
come into the bar

398
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,595
for a special occasion,

399
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,235
like a birthday
or a proposal.

400
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,920
Sometimes they'll come
in here days ahead of time

401
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,600
just to make sure
everything's perfect.

402
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,394
Maybe it's the same for

403
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,432
whoever this Broken
Hearts guy is.

404
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,190
- All right, Lieutenant, what did you want to show us?
- I may have a lead.

405
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,119
Ah, did you find it
during A.V. Club?

406
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,834
We already know
the killer disabled

407
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,315
the hotel's
surveillance cameras.

408
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,676
On the day
of the murders, yes,

409
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,917
but then I started thinking
what if the killer

410
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,191
scoped out the location
a week before?

411
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,114
And I found this.

412
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,916
- Wait, is that...
- Our guy? Maybe.

413
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,279
The car's registered to a Neil
Berger, former schoolteacher.

414
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,790
Well, that's it,
a chap snapping photos?

415
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,514
How do we know
he's not scrapbooking?

416
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,832
I put an APB out on him, and...

417
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,995
We just got a hit.

418
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,113
He's been spotted in front
of the original killer's house.

419
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:25,958
Let's go.

420
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,600
We-Well, that's...

421
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,519
actually quite promising.

422
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,671
Hi.

423
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,592
Listen, I know we're not
exactly speaking right now,

424
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,790
but there's something
that I need to tell you.

425
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,351
Okay.

426
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,111
Now, don't freak out, but, uh,

427
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,840
Charlotte Richards is back.

428
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:52,998
Oh...

429
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,072
But you have absolutely
nothing to worry about, Linda.

430
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,835
She's not, uh...

431
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,360
You know,
she's not Mom anymore.

432
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,391
Wow.

433
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,594
It's really kind of you

434
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,473
to come all the way
over here to tell me that.

435
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,117
I mean, especially...
when you must be dealing with...

436
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,636
such a shock yourself.

437
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,920
You knew, didn't you?

438
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,270
I may have run into Charlotte

439
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,233
a few times...
I don't know,

440
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,875
maybe... here.

441
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,236
You're treating her, Linda?

442
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,191
You didn't think,

443
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,754
just once,

444
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,030
that maybe I had the right
to know that she was alive?

445
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,879
I assumed you knew.

446
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,154
Well, maybe you can help me.

447
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,878
For the last time, man,

448
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,555
please, <i>please</i> quit taking
pictures of my house!

449
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,870
<i>Your</i> house?

450
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,759
You're lucky you get
to <i>live</i> here, okay?

451
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,480
This place should be
a freakin' landmark by now!

452
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,909
Do you know who lived here?
A great artist, man.

453
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,031
Who are you?!

454
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,515
Seriously, last warning, dude.

455
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,676
Next time,
I'm calling the cops.

456
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,195
Call the cops.
They'll be on my side.

457
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,237
Oh, whatever.

458
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,995
- Neil Berger?
- Yeah.

459
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,670
Wow. Sorry you had
to witness that.

460
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,151
Um, bah.

461
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,556
Okay, who's ready?

462
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,712
Ready for what?

463
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,355
For the wonder that is
the Broken Hearts Tour.

464
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,677
Duh. You guys are
my 3:00, right?

465
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,397
Uh-huh.

466
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,557
All right, all right.
Let's get some ponchos on you.

467
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,515
When I ran into Charlotte,
I-I-I may have mentioned

468
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,313
a few things that
I shouldn't have.

469
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,791
But by the time I realized
that she wasn't Mom...

470
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,757
it was too late.

471
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,076
Oh, no.

472
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,634
You know, she was just
staring at me

473
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,718
with these...
these lost eyes,

474
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,440
searching for answers.

475
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,034
What are you
asking me, Amenadiel?

476
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,119
I think that maybe she
deserves to know the truth.

477
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,556
I understand that

478
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,154
you miss your mom

479
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,760
and that you didn't
get to say good-bye.

480
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,037
But Charlotte is a woman
who has literally

481
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,874
been to Hell and back.

482
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,714
She's fragile.

483
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,114
When I found out the truth,
it nearly broke me.

484
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,470
And I was stable.

485
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,717
So what are you saying?

486
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,833
I'm saying if you really
want to help <i>Charlotte...</i>

487
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,274
...you'll stay away.

488
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,871
<i>Originally built in 1909,</i>

489
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,679
Hoffman's iconic
Craftsman home

490
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,076
is just blocks away
from what I like to call

491
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,039
"The Last Heartbreak"...

492
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,509
the scene of the final murder,

493
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,790
and where the killer
was ultimately

494
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,349
apprehended by police.

495
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,390
Why are we wasting our time

496
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,875
with these ridiculous
shenanigans?

497
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,833
Let's just grab this
miscreant and be done with it.

498
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,076
Because, unfortunately,
we don't have

499
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,840
enough evidence to arrest him.

500
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,759
Serial killers love
talking about themselves.

501
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,916
The more Neil talks,
the more likely

502
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,349
he'll incriminate himself.

503
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,270
I may as well be
speaking to myself.

504
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,835
Uh, I'm listening.

505
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,430
Um, excuse me,
uh, Neil, is it?

506
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,633
Yeah. Well, I was wondering
what you thought about

507
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,513
this new copycat killer
who surfaced.

508
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,678
Ask me, it was only a matter of
time before someone picked up

509
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,599
where the original killer left
off. You know, someone special.

510
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,234
Someone who knew there was
a need for what he did.

511
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,194
Right. The original killer,
he was an auteur.

512
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,800
But this new guy,
he's just...

513
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,996
Sort of a cheap copy.

514
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,316
Whoa.

515
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,071
Hold on a second.

516
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,509
This new guy is
not the original,

517
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,439
okay, but he is
a damn sweet cover.

518
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,439
He is efficient,
he is precise.

519
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,194
I mean, he gets the
little details right,

520
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,073
down to the
interlocking fingers.

521
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,158
Detective Decker, LAPD.

522
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,120
That information wasn't
public yet, was it?

523
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,796
No, it wasn't.

524
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,515
Finally, this bloody
charade is over,

525
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,313
and things can all
go back to normal.

526
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,590
I'll meet you
back at the precinct.

527
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,991
Ow.

528
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,034
<i>You're burning my table.</i>

529
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,351
Can I help you?

530
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,437
Kay?

531
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,031
Kay. Kay, how is this possible?

532
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,955
Is this a prank?

533
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,355
Did someone put you up to this?

534
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,829
Look, I get it.

535
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,070
I look just like
my grandmother,

536
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,191
but this is taking things
too far.

537
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,550
Your grandmother,
of course.

538
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,317
I'm sorry, I knew her
back in the day.

539
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,840
The resemblance is
incredible.

540
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,594
You knew her back in the day?

541
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,995
How old were you, like, two?

542
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,790
I'm older than I look.

543
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,432
Well, Mr. Older Than
You Look, I'm Maddie.

544
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,790
Hi. Pierce.

545
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,629
I used to come in here a lot,

546
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,870
back when I was just
a detective.

547
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,520
That's what we do here...

548
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,280
cheap drinks,
good cooking and cops.

549
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,276
That's actually how
my grandparents met.

550
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,516
Gramps was a cop,

551
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,354
and he met Nana when
she was waiting tables.

552
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,195
- "Raids" White is your grandfather?
- Yep.

553
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,550
Cops are always
coming in here

554
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,796
and geeking out over him.

555
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,633
Well, yeah.
Kay married the cop

556
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,274
who solved the Broken
Hearts Killer case.

557
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,876
Well, he made the arrest,
but he never really solved it.

558
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,514
He caught the guy red-handed,

559
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,313
staging bodies
in the Chavez Ravine.

560
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,876
True, but he never revealed how
he chose his victims.

561
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,112
It drove Gramps crazy,
so he kept at it

562
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,589
even after he retired.

563
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,513
He would sit in that
booth right there

564
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,235
with his old files when Nana worked.

565
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,200
Where is Ray these days?

566
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,200
Forest Lawn Cemetery.

567
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,752
Uh, Gramps passed about
six years ago.

568
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,917
And her?

569
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,515
Followed a little after.

570
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,350
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

571
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,798
They lived a long,
happy life together,

572
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,793
and went peacefully,
a few months apart.

573
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,640
That sounds nice.

574
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,797
All right, case
closed, I assume.

575
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,992
And not a particularly
interesting one, in retrospect.

576
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,471
Let's find something that's
more challenging, you know?

577
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,399
More "us."

578
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,111
This case isn't over. We have to
get a confession out of Neil.

579
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,234
Oh, so you and Pierce can do
your dynamic duo thing again?

580
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,636
No. It's you and me this time,
no Pierce.

581
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,112
Oh. No Pierce, but we're still
following his lead in absentia.

582
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,515
We are following the case.

583
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,150
Let's go solve this.

584
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,359
So Neil, from your tour,

585
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,831
I saw that you like
to tell a good story,

586
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,032
how'd you do it?

587
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,477
Yeah.

588
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,751
Uh, well, it was early.

589
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,838
And, uh, we met at a bar.

590
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,276
And then, I, uh,
I gave him a sign.

591
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,474
And he came over, at which
point, I think I said, "Hey,"

592
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,160
and then, he was all like...

593
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,075
- "Hey," and then...
- Right. Can you fast-forward

594
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,158
to the part where you smashed
the couples' chests in?

595
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,917
Wait a minute.

596
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,277
You-you think I'm the copycat?

597
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,836
You fit the killer's
psychological profile to a T,

598
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,515
you know things about the case
that no one else could know.

599
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,075
Oh, my God.

600
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,318
This is gonna be
so amazing for the tour.

601
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,512
Now I'm actually part
of the investigation.

602
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,319
Oh, geez, I owe McMillan now.

603
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,835
Mc... McMillan?

604
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,838
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Officer McMillan over in Vice.

605
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,996
He's helped me out
throughout the years.

606
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,991
You know, he would
slip me, uh,

607
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,475
copies of stuff
for the tour.

608
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,830
And then, when these new
killings started happening,

609
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,951
well, I bought
some photos off of him,

610
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,913
and it was the best 400 bucks
I've ever spent.

611
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,397
Ha! So Pierce doesn't know
everything, after all.

612
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,715
Thank you.

613
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,911
Hey, Dan.

614
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,675
If you're looking
for Twisted Ferret,

615
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,195
they've got a gig
in Bakersfield.

616
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,190
They'll be back.

617
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,471
Because this gig is still
the best gig in town.

618
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,911
The school called.

619
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,554
Apparently,
Trixie gave pot brownies

620
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,433
to Ms. Benson
for Teacher Appreciation Day.

621
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,710
Well, did she appreciate them?

622
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,240
No, she didn't, Maze.

623
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,875
She didn't appreciate being
rushed to the hospital

624
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,355
when she couldn't feel
her legs anymore.

625
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,358
The woman's 70 years old.
What the hell were you thinking?

626
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,957
Hey, not my fault the old hag
can't handle the good stuff.

627
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,759
It's not a joke, Maze!

628
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,594
Our one red line
is our daughter,

629
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,593
and things like this
cannot happen.

630
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,951
Or what, Douche?

631
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,590
If you want to live in
the same home as my kid,

632
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,872
you can't keep pulling
stunts like this.

633
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,751
Fine.

634
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,360
I'll move out.

635
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,750
Since none of you
want me here anyway.

636
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,871
That's not what I'm saying.

637
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,957
No.

638
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,236
No, you would all love me
to be something I'm not.

639
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,911
Well, I am not a babysitter.

640
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,839
I am not a roommate.

641
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,233
And I am sick of your
Goody Two-shoes ex-wife,

642
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,955
and that stupid little brat
of yours anyway.

643
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,477
Maze.

644
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,236
Classy.

645
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,914
<i>So Neil isn't our killer.</i>

646
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,392
No, he's just an obsessed
tour guide

647
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,831
who illegally obtained
crime scene photos.

648
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,997
- So we don't have any suspects.
- Yeah, and our killer

649
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,031
could be trying
to find his next victim.

650
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,356
We need a lead.

651
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,671
Hold on.

652
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,312
You said your grandfather kept
copies of all his files.

653
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,596
Do you still have them?

654
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,956
Somewhere in the back, yeah.

655
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,799
My mom didn't have the heart
to throw them out.

656
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,229
You mind if I take a look?

657
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,317
Sure.

658
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,320
Chloe, meet me at The Adams.

659
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,557
I may have something.

660
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,189
Yeah. I'm on my way.

661
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,959
Ah. I
know that look.

662
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,998
Either there are new sandwiches
in the vending machine,

663
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,071
or you have a lead.

664
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,509
Actually, Pierce has a lead.

665
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,790
Oh, for goodness' sake.

666
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,952
- He wants us to meet him.
- Why?

667
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,230
So we can watch him pontificate

668
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,033
while leading us down
another blind alley?

669
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,234
What is your problem today?

670
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,239
My problem, Detective, is that
we don't need a third party

671
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,874
interfering with
our partnership.

672
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,911
You know what?
Maybe it's best

673
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,076
if I meet Pierce alone.

674
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,715
We don't have time
to make this about you.

675
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,673
There is a serial killer
on the loose.

676
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,599
Uh... Detective.

677
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,234
To wrapping up
your latest case.

678
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,590
Sayonara, Broken Hearts Killer.

679
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,950
Well, Ray was actually
the one to catch him,

680
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,396
but I'm happy
to drink to that anyway.

681
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,119
Now, maybe you can take me
on a real date,

682
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,277
instead of just pie
and drinks here.

683
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,272
Let me guess,
you already have your next case.

684
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,675
No, not this time.

685
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,477
Um...

686
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,989
I'm transferring.

687
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,158
Out of state.

688
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,476
Transferring?

689
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,031
Why?

690
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,394
It's just... time.

691
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,829
I don't understand.

692
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,430
This is what I do. I move
forward and I never look back.

693
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,316
But I thought we...
you and I were...

694
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,510
I deal with death
every day,

695
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,359
and someday, you're gonna die,
too, and I just...

696
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,119
You have these
walls up,

697
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,313
and I thought it was part
of your whole tough guy act,

698
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,958
you're scared.

699
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,233
But you know what
the sad truth is?

700
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,675
If you don't
learn to open up,

701
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,360
nobody will ever love you.

702
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,432
I know.

703
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,950
<i>Pierce, look at this.</i>

704
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,431
Hey.

705
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,957
Pierce.

706
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,470
Are you okay?

707
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,751
Yeah, sorry. Um...

708
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,235
What were you saying?

709
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,837
Your mentor,

710
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,191
look at all this stuff
that he found, like,

711
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,880
look... these call logs.

712
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,276
They prove that the
original killer's victims

713
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,200
all had spouses that called
into the <i>Dear Dottie</i> radio show.

714
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,314
That was a radio show about
love and relationship advice.

715
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,512
Yeah.

716
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,160
Yeah. You really know
your history.

717
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,158
A-Anyway,

718
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,591
it's the only connection that
was found between the victims.

719
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,155
But that show went off the air
years ago.

720
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,760
I'm not sure
how it's gonna help us now.

721
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,675
Well, if the original killer
listened to the radio show

722
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,030
to find his victims, then maybe

723
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,720
the copycat's doing
the same thing.

724
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,957
So the question is what
radio show would that be now?

725
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,799
Oh, my God. <i>Chance's Chocolates?</i>

726
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,719
I'm obsessed.

727
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,671
It's a radio show that sets up
cheating couples.

728
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,712
See, Chance brings
someone on who thinks

729
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,639
their spouse is
cheating, and then,

730
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,952
he calls the cheater pretending
to be a candy shop

731
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,833
giving away free chocolates
as a promotion,

732
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,838
and asks
who they should send it to.

733
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,833
- How thrilling.
- Huh. - Right?

734
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,560
And then, the person
either names their partner

735
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,720
and "Aw, happy ending,"
or... they name someone else,

736
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,320
and expose
their dirty,

737
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,351
cheating ways.

738
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,630
Oh, it's so juicy.

739
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,314
So it turns out, both couples

740
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,113
had a significant other
that appeared on the show.

741
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,470
So
we're assuming

742
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,519
that our killer listens
to this juvenile program?

743
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,194
We've narrowed
our suspects down to anyone

744
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,551
who doesn't have
satellite radio, and Ms. Lopez.

745
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,558
Actually, the addresses
are beeped out.

746
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,833
Probably for reasons like this.

747
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,680
Okay, so the killer has to be
somebody that works on the show.

748
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,155
Someone with access
to this info?

749
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,234
Right. So we need to make
ourselves the target,

750
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,271
and flush the killer out.

751
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,392
Great idea.
Decker and I will do it.

752
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,431
We'll give out
my home address

753
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,397
and lure the killer there.

754
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:29,872
Sure.

755
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,039
- That could work.
- Oh, man.

756
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,993
You guys are totally gonna be
the cheating lovers.

757
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,510
Marvelous. Well,
since that's been sorted,

758
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,518
I assume my services
are no longer needed.

759
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,915
Uh, actually,

760
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,600
there is one
more piece

761
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,115
of the sting we'll need.

762
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,960
And we are here
with our jilted lover, Lucifer.

763
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,480
Now, first off,

764
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,997
what is up with that name?
"Lucifer"? I-I...

765
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,277
You think maybe

766
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,994
that is part of the reason
that's driving a wedge

767
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,350
between you and your old lady?

768
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,990
Well, first off,
I am not a "jilted lover."

769
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,669
No, no. No one ever wants
to believe that, do they?

770
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,633
But you wouldn't be here
if you probably didn't think

771
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,274
something was going on, right?

772
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,278
And we're gonna find out
exactly what that is

773
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,920
when we come back.

774
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,590
You're doing great, by the way.

775
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,431
You're late!

776
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,711
Yeah, sorry I'm late.
Traffic was just awful.

777
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,031
Stop.

778
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,560
I ordered a pastrami.

779
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,554
Is this pastrami?
No, it is not pastrami!

780
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,196
Now get out of here!

781
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,236
And we are back
with our guest Lucifer,

782
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,830
who is now gonna tell us
all about his girl Chloe.

783
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,157
Uh, right. Well, um,
she's my partner.

784
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,391
At work.

785
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,074
Oh, so it's
a workplace thing, huh?

786
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,989
When did things change?

787
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,796
Well, she's been spending quite
a bit of time with our new boss.

788
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,480
Cheating on you with the boss?

789
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,909
Oh, that's low.

790
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,076
Well, it's quite
a bit more complex

791
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,357
than your obnoxious braying's
making it out to be.

792
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,914
Well, let's find out, shall we?

793
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,435
Let's get Chloe on the line.

794
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,117
Uh, yes?

795
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,640
Uh, hello, uh, Chloe?

796
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,991
Uh, this is, uh, Pop Sugar.

797
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,715
We are a new Swiss chocolate
shop in Los Feliz,

798
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,111
and we are, uh,
running a big promotion.

799
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,676
Yeah, we are going to send, uh,
a free box of chocolates

800
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,116
to, uh, your special someone,

801
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,959
if you have
a special someone somewhere?

802
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,310
Oh, wow.

803
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,153
Wow, yeah, that's awesome. Um...

804
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,079
and-and actually,
it's perfect timing.

805
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,751
Um, as we're having, um,
a date night tonight.

806
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,110
Oh! Wonderful.

807
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,317
All we need, then,
is his name and address.

808
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,632
Yeah, his name is Marcus,
and he lives at...

809
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,276
Okay, Chloe, that is good.

810
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,880
Listen, I'm just curious,

811
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,470
because we're all
such romantics here,

812
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,996
what is it about, uh,
t-this, uh, guy

813
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,038
that gives you the goose bumps?

814
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,717
Uh...

815
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,591
um...

816
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,080
well, he's, um...

817
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,520
he's...

818
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,836
he's very handsome.

819
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,272
Yeah, but isn't there anything,
uh, more than just looks?

820
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,991
Um, well, he's very brave,

821
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,438
and we both care
about the same sorts of things,

822
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,911
like, well, doing what's right,

823
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,271
and, uh,
and helping other people.

824
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,470
I think he's a good person.

825
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,114
Sounds like
a hell of a guy.

826
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,397
Uh, and we'll make sure
to get that package to him

827
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,474
uh, before the end of the night.

828
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,353
Okay, thanks.

829
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,916
And there you have it, everyone.

830
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,237
Another cheater exposed.

831
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,477
Sometimes,
chocolate can be dark,

832
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,477
but you know what?

833
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,399
Isn't better to always know
the... truth?

834
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,990
Where the hell did he go?

835
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,393
Welcome to my humble abode.

836
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:35,958
Um...

837
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,077
I like rocks.

838
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,713
You have a
rock collection?

839
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,593
Well, the thing about rocks
is they're old.

840
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,029
They never change.

841
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,160
I've taken one from all
the places I've visited.

842
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,675
You've been a lot
of places, huh?

843
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,315
Well, gather no moss
and all that.

844
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,593
I know I don't have
a lot of things,

845
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,469
but what I love about this place
is the killer view.

846
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,917
Oh, my God.

847
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,636
This is beautiful.

848
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,749
Decker, listen.

849
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,151
I know that our, uh,
opportunity for a second date

850
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,589
was interrupted earlier.

851
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,589
Hopefully this will
make up for it.

852
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,989
Hey, you guys all set?

853
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,432
Hey, Dan. Yeah.
We're all set here.

854
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,271
Coast is clear on my end.

855
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,273
Ah, excellent. Daniel.
You're here.

856
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,477
Hey, pal. I didn't know you
were coming in for this one.

857
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,117
I wasn't, but, um, I wanted
to ask you something.

858
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,638
Okay.

859
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,480
How did you move on
from the detective

860
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,875
when I showed up
and replaced you?

861
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,717
And please,
don't say improv.

862
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,991
- You didn't replace me.
- Well, true, true.

863
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,475
I suppose that would imply
we're on the same level.

864
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,994
Look, I get
it. All right?

865
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,839
I get how you feel with this
whole Pierce and Chloe thing.

866
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,838
- Mm.
- And, yes,

867
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,990
I admit, I did feel a little
jealous when you showed up.

868
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,793
Well, justifiably so.

869
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,517
But then I realized
you had nothing to do

870
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,796
with why my marriage ended.

871
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,436
You and I are
different people.

872
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,558
We each have our own
relationship with Chloe.

873
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,513
Once I came to terms
with that, I was fine.

874
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,031
I hope you don't mind.

875
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,357
I asked Lopez what
your favorite dish was.

876
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,200
No, it's, um, it's great.

877
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,756
Is something wrong?

878
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,040
Um...

879
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,516
um, Marcus, maybe we
shouldn't do this.

880
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,355
Are we too visible?

881
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,471
No.

882
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,033
- Is the plan too obvious?
- No, no, no.

883
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,356
I mean you and me.

884
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,831
You know, we work together
and things could get weird.

885
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,030
That's all.

886
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,277
Look, you asked me
out first, Decker.

887
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,319
I, uh... I did

888
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,273
and you turned me down.

889
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,795
And I... I was disappointed,
but, you know, I got it.

890
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,390
And you're the one who said
you're, you know,

891
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,829
"not relationship material."

892
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,597
You're a good man
and I really like you,

893
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,354
but I, uh, I-I need somebody
who can let me in

894
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,871
and I just don't know
if that's... you.

895
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,719
Hello, shadowy figure.

896
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,235
Here to spoil the date?

897
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,393
God! God!

898
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,871
LAPD. You're under arrest.

899
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,150
I know my rights, okay?

900
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,880
Fair use, I want a lawyer.

901
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,073
Pastrami boy?

902
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,472
- You're the killer?
- Killer? What?

903
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,512
What are you talking about?
Dude, I'm here for the show.

904
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,359
- What show?
- The show, the show.

905
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,359
I-I-I try to film an angry ex
busting in on their spouse.

906
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,791
Like you and then I
put it up on my Web site

907
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,600
as a bootleg
after show. Hey!

908
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,151
Hey, look, I'm trying
to be a producer, man.

909
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,555
The only reason
I'm interning

910
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,956
is so I can get access
to those tapes

911
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,391
and I post those tapes raw
and unedited on my Web site.

912
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,397
Unedited?

913
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,355
Without the addresses
censored out?

914
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,313
Well, yeah, I mean,
that's what unedited means.

915
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,000
I'm showing life
at its most raw.

916
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,557
Ow.

917
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,558
The killer could be listening
to those tapes.

918
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,157
Could be anyone.

919
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,350
Maybe I should've waited
until after dinner

920
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,398
to say all that.

921
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,556
No, you're right.

922
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,480
I do have walls up.

923
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,717
I've had them up
for a long, long time.

924
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,431
When I feel like someone's

925
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,074
getting past them, I run.

926
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,435
But with you, Chloe, I don't
want those walls up anymore.

927
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,915
I don't want to run anymore.

928
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,590
You deserve someone
who's gonna let you in

929
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,757
and I want to do that
if you'll give me the chance.

930
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,276
That's...

931
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,231
Chloe?

932
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,071
You all right?

933
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,116
Chloe!

934
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,911
Chloe.

935
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,434
You shouldn't have hurt him.

936
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,075
Too bad.

937
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,519
If you'd started with him,
I would've let you swing.

938
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,996
You... you're the... you're
the guy from the radio.

939
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,793
Yes, and you're the chap

940
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,400
who bought the original
killer's house.

941
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,353
How remarkably
method of you.

942
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,676
Don't-don't-don't
you get it?

943
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,473
I-I-I-I did this for you.

944
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,434
I-I... these-these two,
they-they-they betrayed you.

945
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,233
I didn't
ask for this.

946
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,396
But you deserve it.

947
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,030
I found Hoffman's journals

948
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,390
hidden in the attic.

949
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,320
He understood how hard it is
to lose someone you care about.

950
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,397
We wanted to show the world

951
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,592
that you-you can't
just leave people.

952
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,710
You don't get to decide who
someone wants to be with.

953
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,677
And neither do I.

954
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,953
Does this mean you're-you're
not, you're not gonna...

955
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,636
Detective.

956
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,276
Oh, my God. Are they okay?

957
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,437
They're fine.
They're fine.

958
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,754
Come on. Wakey-wakey, Detective.

959
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,837
Come on, pal.

960
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,589
Lieutenant Pierce.

961
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,200
I've got a
wake-up for Charlotte.

962
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,998
You are following me.

963
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,920
No, this-this is, this is just
where I come to read the paper.

964
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,359
I know when people
are lying to me.

965
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,833
Honestly, this is just,
um, all... it's really...

966
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,394
all a big misunderstanding.

967
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:59,550
So all the crazy
stuff you said earlier...

968
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,711
is a misunderstanding?

969
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,479
Please, I just...

970
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,034
You don't understand
what it's like

971
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,314
not remembering
what you did,

972
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,191
not knowing who you were.

973
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,236
All I want is the truth.

974
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,039
How do we know each other?

975
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,435
You were my mom.

976
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,477
I know.

977
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,592
I know.

978
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,914
Please, have a seat.

979
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,878
There is, uh, there is
so much to explain.

980
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,240
Olga? Wait, I'm sorry.

981
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,909
I thought that Maze was gonna
be here watching Trixie.

982
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,153
No Maze.

983
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,512
She said mean thing
to me and then she go.

984
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,510
What do you mean, "she go"?

985
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,759
She take her knives
and she move out.

986
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,040
Oh.

987
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,838
Thank you, Olga.

988
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,674
I know. Thank you, though.

989
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,753
Olga, did you forget something?

990
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,036
Well, that's a new one.

991
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,720
Never been mistaken
for an Olga before.

992
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,674
What are you doing here?

993
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,550
I, um...

994
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,150
I wanted to explain.

995
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,836
- Look, I know that I've been acting...
- Insecure.

996
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,391
Childish. Possessive.

997
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,756
Well, I was going
to say strangely, but...

998
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,872
...never mind.

999
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,357
The truth is that perhaps
I was slightly insecure

1000
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,793
about Pierce moving in
on our partnership.

1001
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,600
Oh, Lucifer, that's
not what's happening.

1002
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,677
No, I know,

1003
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,758
because I've realized that
there's room in your life

1004
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,192
for all sorts
of relationships,

1005
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,192
even if one of them
is with... with him.

1006
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,157
- I know...
- Just...

1007
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,915
please, be careful.

1008
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,400
Okay.

1009
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,320
Do you want to stay?
I can make some coffee

1010
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,432
- and we can...
- Ah, I can't, unfortunately.

1011
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,878
There's a bachelorette party
at Lux and... well.

1012
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,036
Okay, another time.

1013
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,591
Yes.

1014
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,759
Okay, well... have fun.

1015
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,597
Dinner sounds great.

1016
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,631
How about tomorrow?

1017
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,951
- That's perfect.
- Good. I'll pick you up at 7:00?

1018
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,317
- Yeah.
- I'll see you then, Chloe.

1019
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,310
Someone special, I assume?

1020
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,950
Yes, she is.

1021
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,796
And for the first time in
my life, I'm gonna go for it.

1022
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,271
Good for you.

1023
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,950
You have to risk
a broken heart

1024
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,072
if you want to get something
out of this life, right?

1025
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,515
It's not my heart
I'm risking.

1026
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,032
She's the key to finally getting
what I've always wanted.
