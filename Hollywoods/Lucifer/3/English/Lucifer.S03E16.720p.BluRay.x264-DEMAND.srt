1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,397
<i>- Previously, on</i> Lucifer...
- My dad screwed us both.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,317
But perhaps there's a way

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,472
- for us to screw him back.
- How?

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,431
By killing you.

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,791
- Amenadiel's nice.
- If he were nice,

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,469
<i>he wouldn't be sneaking around
behind my back with my friend,</i>

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,397
and lying about it.

8
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,636
You know, don't you?

9
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,200
You're the ones
who have been

10
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,631
lying to me about
this fling for weeks.

11
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,796
I'd like to try and help.

12
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,315
You don't have to treat me.

13
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,159
I think I do.
For both of us.

14
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,635
<i>In my quest to help you die,</i>

15
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,876
I've done some research.

16
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:27,957
I've read every book,

17
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,355
<i>I've analyzed every language.</i>

18
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,789
<i>I'm completely out of ideas.</i>

19
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,195
We can't rewrite history.

20
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,357
Detective, you're a genius.

21
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,994
You've just given me my idea.

22
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,276
Once upon a time,

23
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,718
there were two brothers...
Cain and Abel.

24
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,470
They fought, as brothers often
do, over everything.

25
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,599
What's that supposed to be?
Are we shaking hands

26
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,154
or holding spiders?

27
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,392
That's you and your brother

28
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,679
pummeling each other
over a pet rock.

29
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,557
And here's you two scamps
tugging on both ends of a snake.

30
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,796
That's not how it happened.

31
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,037
Well, artistic license,
my friend.

32
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,392
The point is that you were
always at each other's throats.

33
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,554
Until...

34
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,752
...you fought to the death.

35
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,675
You killed Abel

36
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,799
and became the world's

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,195
first murderer.

38
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,676
Now, the part where
my father marks you,

39
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,712
cursing you to walk the earth
for eternity,

40
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,400
- it's tricky to draw.
- Now, um,

41
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,518
I've heard this one before...
the ending sucks.

42
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,269
My point exactly.

43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,797
We all know how your story ends.

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,789
But what if we change
how it begins?

45
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,269
What if you never killed Abel?

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,150
What if we did...

47
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,471
this?

48
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,877
Clean slate.

49
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,236
That's impossible.
How would we do that?

50
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,996
Oh, simple.

51
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,393
I shall fly down to Hell,

52
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,712
pluck your brother's soul, and
drop it into a vacant body.

53
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,032
This would make Abel
technically alive,

54
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,233
and therefore not murdered,
and you innocent.

55
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,116
Wait, back up.
My brother is in Hell?

56
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,432
Yes, of course.
In fact, he's our oldest tenant.

57
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,560
I knew it. Do you know how many
times I've tried to tell people

58
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,553
Abel is the asshat?
No one ever believes me.

59
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,877
Right, can we just focus
on my genius plan?

60
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,912
If we bring Abel
back to life,

61
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,640
that would erase your crime.

62
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,834
No crime, no mark,
no curse.

63
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,356
You'd be mortal
and can finally die.

64
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,591
<i>This one's good.</i>

65
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,159
Oh, this one's
even better.

66
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,079
Yeah, a bit past its
sell-by date, I'm afraid.

67
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,680
Wait till Abel
wakes up in this body.

68
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,717
I never thought
I'd say this,

69
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,919
but slow down, Lieutenant.

70
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,272
Time to lay down some
soul-dropping rules,

71
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,392
or what I think the rules are,
at least.

72
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,920
You have done this
before, right?

73
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,036
Not exactly, but based
on a sample size of, uh,

74
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,038
one crooked cop
and one goddess,

75
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,796
I can only drop a soul into
someone who's recently died.

76
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,158
How recent?

77
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,550
The instant after death.

78
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,956
So we need a fresh one.

79
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,037
How are we gonna find that?

80
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,717
Hey, guys?

81
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,718
There's been an explosion
at a high-rise downtown.

82
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,912
There's one dead at the scene,
one on the way to the ICU.

83
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,480
Oh, that's promising.

84
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,439
- Excuse me?
- He means that's a promising chance

85
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,756
to question the witness
at the hospital.

86
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,235
Mm. Yes,

87
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,512
where loads of people
are on the brink of death.

88
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,918
So you want to question
someone who's unconscious

89
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,315
and in critical condition?

90
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,830
The witness may recover,
have some intel.

91
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,680
- Can't hurt to check.
- Hmm.

92
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,512
Okay, we'll work
the crime scene.

93
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,000
Lucifer, you coming?

94
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,353
Lucifer's coming with me
this time.

95
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,397
Shall we?

96
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,200
Bomb squad did
their threat report.

97
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,232
Ruled it as a homicide,
handed it off to us.

98
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,719
Looks like the bomb
came by messenger.

99
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,037
And, uh, an assistant opened the
package, triggering the bomb.

100
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,472
Huh. Is that the messenger?

101
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,357
Yep. Rest in peace, dude.

102
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,314
We tried to track who sent it,
but they covered their tracks.

103
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,556
One thing we do know

104
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,314
is that the assistant
wasn't the target.

105
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,920
Package was addressed
to her boss.

106
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,038
Producer Alexa Lee, she just
came in, she's pretty shook up.

107
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,232
All right.
Let's go talk to her.

108
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,880
Where were you
when the blast occurred?

109
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,117
At home.

110
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,754
My Tuesday
session with Paolo,

111
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,871
my Pilates trainer.

112
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,833
You have any idea
who'd want to hurt you?

113
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,680
Any past enemies, grudges,
anything like that?

114
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,560
How much time you got?

115
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,429
Come on, this is Hollywood.

116
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,597
I get way more hate
mail than fan mail.

117
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,914
Did any one threat
stand out at all?

118
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,113
Uh, my assistant will know.

119
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,111
Bree Garland.

120
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,993
She deals with all my mail
and...

121
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,359
oh, my God,
did Bree open the box?

122
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,835
She's in the ICU.

123
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,076
But we haven't heard word yet.

124
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,476
Oh, no.

125
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,230
It should have been me.

126
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,270
Poor Bree.

127
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,470
Bree Garland?

128
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,712
- She won't do at all.
- Why not?

129
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,400
Well, how much
do you hate your brother

130
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,756
on a scale of one to ten?

131
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,078
One thousand, infinity plus one.

132
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,637
Right, well, if we pop Abel
into a body this young,

133
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,038
you could be stuck with him
for another 70 years.

134
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,151
That's a lot of quality time.

135
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,390
Copy, not her.

136
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,956
Now, what
we need is someone ancient,

137
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,078
someone at death's door.

138
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,432
Someone...

139
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,872
"Do not resuscitate.

140
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,799
"97 years old,

141
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,990
no next of kin."

142
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,230
Perfect.

143
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,512
Yes, we'll put Abel
in this old coot.

144
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,313
He gets a second
chance at life

145
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,115
and you get your chance
at death.

146
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,831
Let's do this.

147
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,837
Right.

148
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,313
Enjoy the show, Dad.

149
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,031
Right.

150
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,990
Any second now.

151
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,391
Any second.

152
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,276
You sure you did this right?

153
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,113
Well, I know I grabbed Abel
down below.

154
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,113
- Did you put him in the right place?
- Probably.

155
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,237
What do you
mean, "probably"?

156
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,709
Well, like
I said, I'm new to this.

157
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,070
But where else would
I have dropped him?

158
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,437
- Did you screw this up?
- I don't know.

159
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,472
I mean, it's not like
there's an instruction manual.

160
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,711
Lucifer.

161
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,956
Where did she go?

162
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,911
Hmm?

163
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,791
Oh.

164
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,038
Okay, I see
what's happened here.

165
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,551
It appears I may have misplaced
your brother's soul.

166
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,716
But in my defense,
what were the chances

167
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,674
of this young lady expiring
at the exact same time?

168
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,031
Tell me you didn't
put Abel in her body.

169
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,879
So I make
one teeny mistake.

170
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,800
Yes, it appears that Abel is
running around as a young woman.

171
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,560
But the point is, we did it.

172
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,675
Abel's alive.

173
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,190
What matters is,
your curse is lifted

174
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,550
and you should no longer
have your mark.

175
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,319
So come on,
let's have a look.

176
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,910
The mark is still there,
which means I'm still cursed.

177
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,557
We failed.

178
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,990
Bugger.

179
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,276
He's a spry one.

180
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,755
Or she.

181
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,230
No sign of her anywhere.

182
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,556
I mean, him.

183
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,671
This is head-spinning,
isn't it?

184
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,712
- We need to find him.
- Why?

185
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,230
You already figured
out a plan "B"?

186
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,477
Another way Abel can help
remove your curse? What is it?

187
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,637
I don't know, but whatever it
is, it has to involve Abel.

188
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,558
Right.

189
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,597
Time to call
the detective.

190
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,637
Yeah, that's a great idea.

191
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,519
"Hey, Decker.
We broke Abel out of Hell,

192
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,035
"dropped his soul
into the wrong body

193
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,469
"and lost him.
Now he's on the lam

194
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,439
"in the body of the victim
from your case.

195
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,513
Also, I'm immortal."

196
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,234
There's no need to get snippy.

197
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,477
Fine, we'll do this on
our own under the radar.

198
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,796
Now, he's your brother.

199
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,990
Where do you think he'd go?

200
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,316
I don't know,
we're not exactly in touch.

201
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,556
It's been a few millennia.

202
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,830
You tortured him in Hell.

203
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,030
You probably know him
better than I do.

204
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,038
Barely saw him, actually.

205
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,272
I was more of a big
picture kind of guy.

206
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,034
The good news is
I do know a demon or two.

207
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,311
Come on.

208
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,752
<i>Who knew a producer</i>

209
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,832
could have this many enemies?

210
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,192
Occupational hazard,
I guess.

211
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,833
Yikes, check this out.

212
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,477
Look at that.

213
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,151
Huh.

214
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,430
"You're going to die."

215
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,439
- Hmm.
- I do believe we have a winner.

216
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,276
Hang on.

217
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,196
Look at the Gs.

218
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,880
It's the same handwriting.

219
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,595
Sent a few weeks back.

220
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,592
They were upset

221
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,076
about one of Alexa's movies,
<i>The Plunge.</i>

222
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,439
"It's full of lies.

223
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,360
If you want the real truth,
read <i>The Z Prophecy."</i>

224
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,598
What is that?

225
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,836
Wait, Alexa made <i>The Plunge?</i>

226
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,757
Have you seen it?

227
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,440
Oh, man. A group of teens,

228
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,960
they have to travel
to the center of the Earth

229
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,236
to unclog
this blocked-up magma.

230
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,113
Oh, man, does it get intense.

231
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,755
Mm-hmm. Whoever
wrote this letter

232
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,196
wants people to read
<i>The Z Prophecy.</i>

233
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,675
Wonder what it is.

234
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,351
"Visionary, Liam Wade,"
author of <i>The Z Prophecy</i>

235
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,519
and a whole bunch of other
conspiracy theories. Wow.

236
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,752
Seems pretty bonkers.
Check out his manifesto.

237
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,797
Look.

238
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,279
It's the same handwriting
as the letters.

239
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,950
Okay, we need to talk to him

240
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,516
and find out exactly why
he was threatening Alexa.

241
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,678
<i>Crap.</i>

242
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,670
Old socks.

243
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,317
Moldy leaves.

244
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,113
If it tastes so bad,
why drink it?

245
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,919
Well, I read that
five doses a day

246
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,952
helps supercharge
your memory.

247
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,920
I've also tried...

248
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,718
meditation, sudoku,

249
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,797
a lot of broccoli,

250
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,509
but no recovered memories
so far.

251
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,949
Just flatulence.

252
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,000
I was hoping
that you had some,

253
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,839
um, memory-jogging techniques.

254
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,111
Perhaps some mental exercises
I could do,

255
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,635
preferably, while I'm sleeping

256
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,792
because that's four hours a day

257
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,832
I don't need to waste
just sleeping.

258
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,953
You do realize you can't win
at therapy.

259
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,600
Oh, please,
I can win at anything.

260
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,870
Let's start there.

261
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,231
Your desire to win tells me

262
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,551
you have a strong need
for control.

263
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,029
Could we focus
on finding my lost memories?

264
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,714
Because that's what
I'm paying you for.

265
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,559
Well, I think
we should slow down

266
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,877
and focus on what
you do remember.

267
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,239
You say that you keep reliving
the same thing over and over.

268
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,672
Is it like,

269
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,035
say, an endless, horrible loop?

270
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,356
One you weren't even aware
you were trapped in?

271
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,753
I know this is scary.

272
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,832
But it's where we need to start.

273
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,430
In your Hell.

274
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,353
No, that's the last thing
I need.

275
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,472
And not what
I asked you for at all.

276
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,911
Okay, well, it's not really
about what you think you need.

277
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,709
Or ask for.

278
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,599
I know you're used
to being in charge,

279
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,514
but I'm the expert here.

280
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,311
You need to let me drive this.

281
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,559
Drive me crazy, so that you can
get me hooked on therapy,

282
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,240
and milk me for every cent.

283
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,837
No, thanks.

284
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,556
Oh, God, Abel.

285
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,440
You never forget your first.

286
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,960
So you'll help us
find him, then?

287
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,237
I'll tell you what I know

288
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,636
so you can do
your own grunt work for once.

289
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,996
Did you know
that Abel

290
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,429
was the first soul in Hell?

291
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,194
Mm, an infernal guinea pig,

292
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,756
- so to speak.
- We all learned to torture

293
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,950
by torturing him.

294
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,355
What'd you do to him?

295
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,029
Well,
Abel would be out partying,

296
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,389
and then, <i>you'd</i> show up.

297
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,750
I don't walk like that.

298
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,155
- Yeah, you do.
- Yes, you do.

299
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,676
Why was I even there?

300
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,872
You were the star
of Abel's Hell loop.

301
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,837
No matter what he did, you'd
always show up, and kill him.

302
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,557
Over and over.

303
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,238
I was his torturer?

304
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,238
Whilst this
is all very illuminating,

305
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,999
Maze, how do we find Abel?

306
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,031
Keep an ear out

307
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,560
for someone babbling
in Sumerian?

308
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,075
Oh, no, no.

309
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,475
He speaks English.

310
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,074
And all the romance languages.

311
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,993
Arabic, Mandarin.

312
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,271
I mean, he's a little dated,
and his Hindi needs work.

313
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,556
Wait, what?

314
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,037
Me and the other demons

315
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,709
would get bored,
so we'd switch up the Hell loop.

316
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,434
Okay? It would always be you
killing him,

317
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,109
but at different times,
different places.

318
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,875
He was a fast learner.

319
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,640
So, what you're saying
is Hell made him multilingual

320
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,069
and completely adaptable?

321
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,192
And we put him in the body
of a young woman.

322
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,757
Smooth move, boys.

323
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,152
Hold on. If Abel's Hell
was constantly changing,

324
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,000
then this may just feel
like another Hell loop to him.

325
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,351
He may have no idea
he's actually alive again.

326
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,758
Do you remember
where he would start his loop?

327
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,235
- Yes.
- Hmm.

328
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,720
Do you know
who he reminds me of?

329
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,840
Total poon hound.

330
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,319
You want to know
where Abel is...

331
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,315
...ask yourself.

332
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,590
Where would

333
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,433
caveman Lucifer go?

334
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,477
Fancy a walk?

335
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,071
Ladies, ladies.

336
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,159
Let's be fruitful,
and multiply, huh?

337
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,240
Allow me to bless you
with my seed.

338
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,517
Would it kill this nutjob
to put in a driveway?

339
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,791
Right, Chloe?

340
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,118
Huh?

341
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,391
Chloe.

342
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,632
What? Sorry, sorry.
I'm distracted.

343
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,160
- It's just...
- Yeah.

344
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,955
Pierce, taking Lucifer.

345
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,040
I'm worried that it's something
I did or said or both.

346
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,037
Why?

347
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,596
What did you do or say?

348
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,991
Well...

349
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,310
uh, you know what? Never mind.

350
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,035
It's not Pierce,
i-it's Lucifer.

351
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,960
When he started here,
no one wanted to work with him.

352
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,630
And I spent all this time
training him, and...

353
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,957
now that he's somewhat
of a decent partner,

354
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,958
Pierce just swoops in
and grabs him?

355
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,999
Lucifer doesn't even blink?

356
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,671
It's not cool.

357
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,518
Right.

358
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,597
Possessive much?

359
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,319
Come on,
I'm just giving you a hard time.

360
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,840
So he's working with Pierce.

361
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,554
Lucifer's still
your partner.

362
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,757
What?

363
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,995
What, do I got something
on my face?

364
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,120
Oh, God, is there a spider?

365
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,430
Is it still there?

366
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,395
It's not a spider.

367
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,197
It's a sniper.

368
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,351
What?

369
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,550
Mr. Wade?

370
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,716
Please put down the weapon.

371
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,355
This is private property.

372
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,353
Leave now.

373
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,035
Did you send this note

374
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,470
to Alexa Lee?

375
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,154
You read my message.

376
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,272
People are finally
starting to listen.

377
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,600
Mr. Wade,
um, we're here

378
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,475
because of a recent attempt
on Alexa's life.

379
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,350
Wait, why do you think
I would want to hurt Alexa?

380
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,356
Well, for starters, in the note,
you said that she was gonna die.

381
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,273
Yeah. Because she is.

382
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,551
She's gonna die.

383
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,911
I'm gonna die.

384
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,760
We're all gonna die
if we don't act now.

385
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,152
I wasn't threatening Alexa.

386
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,995
- I wrote her a wake-up call.
- About what?

387
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,109
Well, I'm glad you asked, ma'am.

388
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,631
You see,

389
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,992
our planet's magma flows
are blocked.

390
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,755
If that flow isn't
released, soon...

391
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,037
...big, molten apocalypse.

392
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,071
Right.

393
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,271
I saw the movie.

394
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,837
And now you don't believe me,
and that is the problem.

395
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,555
<i>The Plunge</i> made the
prophecy into a joke.

396
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,191
Her crappy movie made a mockery

397
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,120
out of a very,
very serious issue.

398
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,113
I don't know, man,
I kind of dug <i>The Plunge.</i>

399
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,595
Seriously?

400
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,872
A jock, a nerd and a princess
save the planet?

401
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,911
I mean, come on.

402
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,190
It was fun.

403
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,509
Wow.

404
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,519
Look. I hated Alexa's movie.

405
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,276
Okay? But I would
never hurt her.

406
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,838
I-I actually kind of owe her.

407
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,630
Because guess who has 196 more
Twitter followers

408
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,950
since <i>The Plunge</i> premiered?

409
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,629
Okay, if you didn't
attack her, then who did?

410
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,593
Alexa had a lot of enemies.

411
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,198
Big Agro, Big Frack.

412
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,629
The Bolivians.

413
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,270
The carnies.

414
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,550
Carnies?

415
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,310
Okay, we're gonna need

416
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,630
to search your property.

417
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,956
Extensively.

418
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,397
Mm.

419
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,432
Look at the bosoms on that one.

420
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,237
This <i>is</i> the land
of milk and honey.

421
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,996
Hello, Abel.

422
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,520
I've been watching you, Abel.

423
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,195
I do not want to lay with you.

424
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,675
Or any other man.

425
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,990
It's not my thing.

426
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,634
Listen, I'm not hitting on you.

427
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,276
You're a pawn.

428
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,120
Brought here by forces
that you don't understand.

429
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,033
Now, I'm here to take you
back to where you belong.

430
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,075
Okay. Does "no"
not mean "no" anymore?

431
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,312
I want one of these fine maidens

432
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,916
to warm my
bed, not you.

433
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,157
Or any of the men
who've been eyeing me

434
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,039
- like I'm some big hunk of...
- Abel.

435
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,114
Have you seen
yourself lately?

436
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,231
Oh.

437
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,519
Are those bosoms mine?

438
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,756
So that's why none
of those menfolk

439
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,076
heard a word I said.

440
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,959
Doesn't all this feel familiar?

441
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,877
Don't you sense
what's about to happen?

442
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,637
Yes.

443
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,632
Every time I seek out revelry,
my brother arrives.

444
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,870
And what
does he do?

445
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,476
He...

446
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,711
He kills me.

447
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,512
Over and over.

448
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,475
And there's nothing
I can do to avoid it.

449
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,275
I've tried everything.

450
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,799
Fighting him, running from him,
all in vain.

451
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,356
I'm trapped.

452
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,672
I can never escape.

453
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,360
You're right, Abel.

454
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,836
You can't fight him.

455
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,911
But I may have a way
out of this for you.

456
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,400
You want me to kill myself?

457
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,994
Well, I've never tried
that before.

458
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,671
How many more strip clubs
are we going to search?

459
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,280
Why, as many as it takes.

460
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,392
What would I and
therefore Abel do next?

461
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,915
Keep up the fun, obviously.

462
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,520
Well, we just spent
the last half hour

463
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,195
wandering past billboards
of women's lingerie.

464
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,470
And your problem is?

465
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,716
"Problems," plural.

466
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,230
No sign of Abel,

467
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,995
We have no idea what we're
gonna do even if we find him.

468
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,998
Well, speak for yourself,
Negative Nelly, 'cause I think

469
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,515
I've worked out exactly
what we need to do.

470
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,149
- Wait, you have?
- Yes.

471
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,874
Well, Dad's an old school kind
of guy, right?

472
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,474
Eye for an eye, and all that?

473
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,469
You killed Abel, so in order to
make things truly even-steven...

474
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,999
- Abel has to kill me.
- Mm-hmm.

475
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,236
It does make sense.

476
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,714
So which way do you think
you're headed?

477
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,950
Once you finally pop off.

478
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,591
Pearly gates or
blazing inferno?

479
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,990
Be ironic if you went to all
this trouble

480
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,429
just to end up in a Hell loop.

481
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,712
I'd never punish myself
like that.

482
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,078
Hell is all about your own guilt
torturing you, right?

483
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,350
- Right.
- Well,

484
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,156
my conscience is clear.

485
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,791
Oh.

486
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,070
Killing your brother
isn't the kind of thing

487
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,191
you just shake off.

488
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,920
Listen, Abel wanted
to kill me just as much

489
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,236
as I wanted to kill him.

490
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,756
Why do you think <i>he's</i> in Hell?

491
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,120
I'm just the guy
who won the fight.

492
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,270
Hello.

493
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,236
Where would I
and therefore Abel go next?

494
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,795
Wherever she's going.

495
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,875
Results from our samples
came back.

496
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,754
Liam told the truth.

497
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,633
No trace of explosive compounds
on the farm.

498
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,240
- Or much else.
- Hmm.

499
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,715
Unless you count
all the turkey jerky

500
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,354
he was hoarding
for the apocalypse.

501
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,159
"Bolivian crime organizations"?

502
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,119
You're not taking Liam
seriously, are you?

503
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,714
Okay, don't laugh,
but I've been looking into

504
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,871
some of his theories.

505
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,833
Ring of evil carnies.

506
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,190
I'm calling it.

507
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,438
All right. Ella got back to me
with her bomb report.

508
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,472
It was made from fertilizer
that's banned in the U.S.,

509
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,830
but guess where
it's still being used.

510
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,514
Bolivia? No way.

511
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,598
Yeah. So I took a closer
look into Alexa's company

512
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,792
to see if I could prove
a Bolivian connection.

513
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,996
Uh-huh.

514
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,518
She's got a lot
of international financiers,

515
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,559
which is pretty normal nowadays.

516
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,393
But I highlighted
the Bolivian ones.

517
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,592
Guess there was a grain of truth
in Liam's craziness.

518
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,875
We should cross-check that list
with the FBI and DHS.

519
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,878
I already did.
These names are linked up

520
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,400
to the Bolivian drug cartel.

521
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,559
This is my contact from the TSA.

522
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,353
One of the Bolivian contractors
landed in L.A. this morning.

523
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,909
Wonder what he's doing here.

524
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,193
I know you can do it, Abel.

525
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,319
Wait. Who are you?

526
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,200
How do you know all of this?

527
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,510
No!

528
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,791
That's her.

529
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,236
What are you
doing here?

530
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,999
Where'd he go? I mean,
where did she go?

531
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,350
I don't know.

532
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,073
I told you
to stay out of my way.

533
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,871
And I told you
Father cursed Cain for a reason.

534
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,553
You actually thought
that I would just

535
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,355
sit around while you two idiots

536
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,034
were raising Abel?

537
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,120
I've been following you, Luci.

538
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,392
So reckless,
even by your standards.

539
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,956
Well, I think
it's rather brilliant, actually.

540
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,836
Using the wings Dad
unfairly punished me with

541
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,316
to undo another one
of his unfair punishments.

542
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,749
Do you seriously not realize

543
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,519
just how dangerous it is
to anger Father?

544
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,069
Have you also forgotten that
He took away your devil face?

545
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,078
Precisely my point, brother.

546
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,875
I've got nothing left to lose.

547
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,799
Oh, don't be foolish, Luci.

548
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,034
There are so many things

549
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,754
that Father can still
take away from you.

550
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,474
Again with the fearmongering.

551
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,720
For the nth time, I'm not going
to just take Dad's abuse.

552
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,071
Cowering from Him
is your jam, remember?

553
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,510
You know what?

554
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,072
It's not you that I am trying
to prove my worth to.

555
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,390
So think what you will,
do what you will.

556
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,840
I'm gonna find Abel and send him
back to where he belongs.

557
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,190
Oh, so we're just gonna
let him leave,

558
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,516
so he can get in our way later.

559
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,115
No, no.

560
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,836
Next time, we'll be ready.

561
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,634
Bad news. Dead guy?

562
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,355
Bolivian cartel hit man.

563
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,477
What?

564
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,560
The Bolivian cartel
wants to kill Bree? Why?

565
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,637
Don't know.

566
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,396
There's no keeping this
from Decker anymore.

567
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,632
Fine. I'll let you tell her.

568
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,231
Okay.

569
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,080
Okay? That's it?

570
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,192
What, you're not gonna
tear him a new one?

571
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,312
Come on, I've gotten
much worse for much less.

572
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,159
I'm not gonna yell at my boss,

573
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,000
even if he lost
our witness twice.

574
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,999
Oh, because you've got
a soft spot for him?

575
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,078
Because I'm not an idiot.

576
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,239
Look, you're the lieutenant,
you call the shots.

577
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,876
But the next time you want
to steal my partner

578
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,197
to tail the target
of my investigation,

579
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,914
you want to clue me in first?

580
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,157
Before it turns into
a public gunfight?

581
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,874
Deal. Next time.

582
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,190
You said "target."

583
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,430
Are you thinking the bomb was
meant for Bree and not Alexa?

584
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,029
Well, maybe the Bolivians knew

585
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,873
that Bree always opened
her boss' mail,

586
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,275
used it as a misdirect.

587
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,357
Well, I still
don't understand.

588
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,632
Why does the Bolivian cartel
want a Hollywood assistant dead?

589
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,433
Did she neglect
to pick the pistachios

590
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,676
off their quinoa salad?

591
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,996
Well, that's the missing piece.

592
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,759
So we should find out
what Alexa knows.

593
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,640
- If I can have my partner back?
- Of course.

594
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,599
I'll track down Bree,
I need to find him before...

595
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,990
You mean her.

596
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,273
I need to find <i>her</i>
before the cartel does.

597
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,637
Mm-hmm.

598
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,112
So the bomb
wasn't for me.

599
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,549
Well, the intended target

600
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,116
was your assistant, Bree.
Have you heard from her lately?

601
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,438
What are you talking about?
Bree's in the hospital.

602
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,517
She fled from the ER.

603
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,439
No one's heard from her.
She could be in a lot of danger.

604
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,756
I guarantee she is.

605
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,440
Well, how's that
possible?

606
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,792
I-I was told she suffered
fatal internal injuries.

607
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,919
Yes, well, you could say
she's like a new man.

608
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,356
Well, thank God,
but we need to find her.

609
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,871
We're doing everything we can
to make sure she's safe.

610
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,237
What?
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

611
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,909
That, too,
but I need her back so bad.

612
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,760
Do you know what it's like
to have someone take away

613
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,076
an assistant you depend on?

614
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,720
Yes, I do, actually.

615
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,640
I mean, I-I am seriously
lost here without her.

616
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,832
I-I don't even know how
to call out of the office.

617
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,031
Do you know how?

618
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,829
So you have no idea
what kind of beef

619
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,714
these Bolivian associates
of yours may have had with Bree?

620
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,990
I don't.

621
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,077
Bree is fluent in Spanish,

622
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,272
so she dealt with those
investors directly.

623
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,914
And you didn't think
to vet them at all

624
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,600
before you went
into business with them?

625
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,440
Have you seen the films I make?
I can't afford to be picky.

626
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,438
Someone offers me money,
I take it.

627
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,836
Okay, well, I'm gonna need to
see any documented interactions

628
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,116
you have with these investors.

629
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,391
- Absolutely, they're in there.
- Okay.

630
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,835
Oh, right.

631
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,277
Only Bree's fingerprint
can unlock it.

632
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,638
Bree installed a biometric lock
on the file cabinet?

633
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,996
Seems a little paranoid.

634
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,675
What did she
have to hide?

635
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,515
Two recent incoming wires
for 50 grand each,

636
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,916
- both from a South American bank.
- Bingo.

637
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,999
Shady side business
with the Bolivians it is.

638
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,273
So Bree was embezzling
from that useless boss of hers.

639
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,357
Huh, who can blame her?

640
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,712
Does loyalty mean
nothing to you?

641
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,276
Alexa gave Bree
her first job in Hollywood.

642
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,710
She trained her.

643
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,236
You don't just
ditch that

644
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,239
the minute some
big-armed, blue-eyed,

645
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,637
toned...

646
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,953
Bolivian drug lord
comes around, okay?

647
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,594
Y-you, you don't, you don't.

648
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,754
Dan, if Bree bolted from the ER,

649
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,753
maybe she left some things
behind, like her phone.

650
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,156
Mm-hmm, which could hold proof

651
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,953
to her connection
with the Bolivians.

652
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,594
That's good thinking.
I'm gonna check on that.

653
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,631
Okay, thanks.

654
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,717
All right,
I'm gonna see if Pierce

655
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,990
had any luck finding Bree.

656
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,919
Oh, well,
he won't need any luck.

657
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,600
He's got something
far better than that.

658
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,151
Decker's right. You're cute.

659
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,869
But I'm mid-bounty
and I just got a lead.

660
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,877
So, if you don't mind...

661
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,276
Lucifer told me to tell you
this is exactly the opposite

662
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,834
of what Amenadiel wants.

663
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,877
I'm in.

664
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,198
Great.

665
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,713
- How do we find him?
- Well...

666
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,075
Your brother's
a predictable one.

667
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,954
He always runs to food or boobs.

668
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,591
Usually boobs.

669
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,160
That's how we found him
the first time.

670
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,795
Now he <i>has</i> boobs, that might
change his itinerary.

671
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,719
That's right,
I totally forgot about that.

672
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,991
Is he hot?

673
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,800
Just tell me how we find him.

674
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,552
Well, every now and again,

675
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,831
the sucker would do something
I never saw coming.

676
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,956
Hello, Cain.

677
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,590
And good-bye.

678
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,910
Just like that.

679
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,437
Yes! Finally!

680
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,630
Slayed you before

681
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,036
you slayed me!

682
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,560
Ashes to ashes,

683
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,194
you bastard!

684
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,560
Enjoy it while
it lasts, Abel.

685
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,436
How do you know my name?

686
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,520
And what is that
supposed to mean?

687
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,430
Thanks for the heads-up.

688
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,553
You said you wanted to die.
Make up your mind, cupcake.

689
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,229
And the mark is still there.

690
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,796
Please, no.
No, please.

691
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:44,958
Please.

692
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,153
Just make it quick, Cain.
Please make it quick.

693
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,836
No.

694
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,159
I need you alive,
so you can help me die.

695
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,710
Wait, what?

696
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,638
This has to be a trick.
You always kill me.

697
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,678
That was when you were in Hell,

698
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,912
where you've spent
the last few millennia.

699
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,316
Maze tortured you
in the afterlife.

700
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,553
Your punishment
was to get killed

701
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,198
by me, over and over.

702
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,990
That's right.

703
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,317
You were trapped in a Hell loop,
but now you're out.

704
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,631
You're alive, brother.

705
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,277
Turns out Abel killing me
didn't remove the mark.

706
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,994
Mm-hmm. Right, yes,
I got that from the whole

707
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,640
"you still being alive"
of it all.

708
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,560
So much for making
everything even-steven.

709
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,080
It's now time for Plan "C."

710
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,760
I didn't realize we had one.

711
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,831
We don't.

712
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,511
But we'll think of something.

713
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,360
Okay, and how is bringing
your she-brother

714
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,960
into the precinct
going to help?

715
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,073
Much as I'm enjoying his <i>Basic Instinct</i> routine.

716
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,350
First things first,
we have to make sure

717
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,670
the Bolivians
don't kill him.

718
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,871
Bree.

719
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,715
I'm Detective Decker.

720
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,632
This is Charlotte Richards
from the DA's office.

721
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,354
Miss Garland,
do you confirm

722
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,552
that you're waiving
your right to legal council?

723
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,680
Yes. Woman, I will waive
whatever you want me to waive.

724
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,239
Uh, Lieutenant said
he had noticed

725
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,556
some PTSD symptoms,

726
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,910
so we should just
kind of roll with it

727
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:15,991
if we can.

728
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,232
Don't take this lightly,
Miss Garland.

729
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,596
It's a big decision.

730
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,639
Mmm. Not as big as my flock.

731
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,197
Do you know how many
sheep I possess?

732
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,479
Enough for two wives.

733
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,799
Enough to feed
our offspring

734
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,276
and our offspring's offspring.

735
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,320
He fits right in.

736
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,358
Is it me, or is your plan
going down in flames?

737
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,630
It'll work.

738
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,799
Well, as impressive
as your flock sounds,

739
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,476
let's get back
to the deal.

740
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,875
The terms are simple.

741
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,351
You share all the
information you have

742
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,677
on the Bolivian cartel
in exchange for immunity.

743
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,633
And the full protection
of the LAPD.

744
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,957
Yes, to whatever
those words mean.

745
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,240
Now, let's discuss who is going
to lay with me first.

746
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,037
Uh, don't you want to read
the terms of the deal, at least?

747
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,233
What for? I've been told
you're very wise.

748
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,637
I trust you.

749
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,957
Just like that?

750
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,159
You're going to
let us drive this,

751
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,033
just completely give up control?

752
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,317
Mm-hmm.

753
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,956
Doesn't that scare you?

754
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,234
Not nearly as much as the place
I just escaped.

755
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,358
I would do anything to avoid
returning to that Hell.

756
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,638
If you'd been there,
you would do the same.

757
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,552
Charlotte.

758
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,872
Yes, sorry,
we're good.

759
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,874
Great. Great.
Okay, Bree?

760
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,640
- Mm-hmm.
- Come on, you're coming with me.

761
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,554
Mm, you smell good.

762
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,596
Well so much for her being
released into <i>your</i> custody.

763
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,274
We can't let him spend
too much time with Decker.

764
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,470
She'll figure out
something's going on.

765
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,916
Let me see
what I can do.

766
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,839
It's time for you
to go home, Abel.

767
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,959
It wasn't easy for me
to track you down,

768
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,157
but you're not getting away
from me this time.

769
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,516
What the...

770
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,234
Meet my
punching bag.

771
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,230
Look familiar?

772
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,397
Mazikeen.
What are you doing here?

773
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,750
What does it look like?

774
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,438
Keeping you out
of Lucifer's way.

775
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,514
I don't want to
fight you, Mazikeen.

776
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,153
Who cares what you want?

777
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,278
So you worked here
for two years,

778
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,636
it's still not ringing a bell?

779
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,274
No, but your backside
is ringing a...

780
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,789
Oh, you poor, forgetful thing.

781
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,713
Thankfully, all we need
is your fingerprint.

782
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,276
Well, my finger goes wherever
the lady tells me it goes.

783
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,552
Hey, Dan. Did you have any
luck finding Bree's phone?

784
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,557
No.

785
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,194
Because guess who collected
her stuff from the hospital?

786
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,071
Alexa.

787
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,873
- That's odd.
- Yeah, right?

788
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,510
So, I dug deeper.

789
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,074
Looked into her Pilates alibi.

790
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,919
Her class

791
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,270
is actually in the morning.

792
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,075
She rescheduled that day
for 2:00 p.m. exactly.

793
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,398
It's like she knew to be
out of the office.

794
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,716
She knew the bomb was coming.

795
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,513
- Who knew?
- Alexa.

796
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,955
What, and the Bolivians
warned her? Why?

797
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,152
Put it on speakerphone.

798
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,353
Okay, maybe the Bolivians were
working with Alexa, not Bree.

799
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,114
Maybe Bree found out
what they were up to

800
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,470
and wanted to blow the whistle.

801
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,955
Well, that would explain

802
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,152
those incoming wires
in Bree's account.

803
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,315
Cartel tried to pay her off,
silence her.

804
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,636
And when the nice way
didn't work,

805
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,400
they tried the not-so-nice way.

806
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,240
Well, hopefully the proof is
behind drawer number one, so...

807
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,751
Wait a minute.

808
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,360
Why would Alexa send us
straight to the place

809
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,233
where we'd find proof
of her crimes?

810
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,317
Makes no sense.

811
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:46,798
Unless...

812
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,356
...it's a trap.

813
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,477
Bree, wait!

814
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,353
Don't move.

815
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,790
Alexa knew Bree would need proof

816
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,639
to turn her in, so she must have
rigged the file cabinet

817
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,400
that contained it.
We walked right into her trap.

818
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,829
If they move,
the whole thing blows.

819
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,474
Call the bomb squad.

820
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,353
Decker, you need to get
out of there, stat.

821
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,994
I'm not going anywhere,
Lieutenant.

822
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,476
What do you mean,
you're not going anywhere?

823
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,797
You need to get
out of there, now.

824
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,474
Don't worry,
I'm staying right here.

825
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,592
Oh, woman,
your loyalty touches me.

826
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,790
What happened to
"You're the lieutenant,

827
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,076
you call the shots"?

828
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,112
There is an innocent victim

829
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,356
glued to a bomb.

830
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,870
"Innocent victim"
is highly debatable.

831
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,191
Lucifer, Bree was trying to do
the right thing.

832
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,357
It's why the Bolivians
and Alexa want her dead.

833
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,670
I'm not leaving.

834
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,950
Oh, my flock

835
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,719
is your flock,
this I swear.

836
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,558
Okay.

837
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,638
No, no, no, o-opposite of okay.

838
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,710
If you're gonna stay, Decker,

839
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,149
I can talk you through
defusing it.

840
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,311
It's safer
than waiting for it

841
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,840
to blow up before the bomb squad
gets there...

842
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,190
Wait a minute.
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

843
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,033
Chloe, Chloe,
think about this, okay?

844
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:58,997
Think about Trixie.

845
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,550
I <i>am</i> thinking about her.

846
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,236
And I'm also thinking
that Bree's a daughter, too.

847
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,476
Oh, come on.

848
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,836
So...

849
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,196
...what do I do now? What,

850
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,039
cut all these wires willy-nilly?

851
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,389
Damn movies. No.

852
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,036
You have to get into the box
and disconnect the trigger.

853
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,276
And, very carefully,

854
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,834
remove the blasting cap.

855
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,110
Ugh, this is madness.

856
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,999
Then toss it as far as possible.

857
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,760
Oh, you want her to toss an
explosive, that sounds safe.

858
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,270
If the cap goes off away from
the charge, it'll be harmless.

859
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,080
Lieutenant!
I understand why your priority

860
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,680
is to save your...

861
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,196
this young woman, but I
will not let you endanger

862
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,760
the detective's life
in the process.

863
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,519
He's not endangering my life.

864
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,916
I am choosing to be here,
and if you're not gonna help,

865
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,514
you should probably just leave.

866
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,598
Well, we both know
I'm not gonna do that.

867
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,795
I'm your partner.

868
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,556
Okay, good.

869
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,199
Then listen to me...
I'm gonna need both my hands,

870
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,311
so please come help me.

871
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,795
Okay? Hold this.

872
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,118
I'll use this,
and, uh...

873
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,829
All right.

874
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,550
Easy...

875
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,240
Got the blasting cap.

876
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,112
And...

877
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,996
Okay.

878
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,555
I think that means you can
take your thumb off now.

879
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,316
All right.

880
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,840
And don't tell us

881
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,309
where you want to put it next.

882
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,789
<i>Up your butt!</i>

883
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,760
That's where I want
to shove this.

884
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,239
And then, I'll press the button.

885
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,352
I don't even understand
why you're so angry.

886
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,231
So what if Linda and I
got together?

887
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,751
You dumped me.

888
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,390
Remember?

889
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,069
No, it's not about that.

890
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,392
Okay? It's about the betrayal.

891
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,156
The dirty...

892
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,631
...sneaky...

893
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,470
...lies!

894
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,396
When will
you understand

895
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,956
that we were trying
to protect you?

896
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,760
And when will you understand
I don't believe you?

897
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:14,951
All right.

898
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,312
Fine.

899
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,629
Well, come on!

900
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,474
Come on! It's no fun
if you just stand there!

901
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,154
It's about as much fun
as watching you

902
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,113
break Linda's heart, I'd say.

903
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,475
Even this, you had to ruin.

904
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,878
Okay, thank you.

905
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:01,997
Hi.

906
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,516
So, we were able to lift

907
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,240
one of Alexa's prints
from the explosive.

908
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,840
Oh, good.

909
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,360
Sounds like enough
to arrest her for murder.

910
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,160
And get her to flip
on the Bolivians.

911
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,714
Apparently, she was using
her movies to launder money

912
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,956
for the cartel.

913
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,992
And that's what Bree
was trying to expose.

914
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,159
Shame. I mean, I had the perfect
title for <i>The Plunge 2.</i>

915
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,516
<i>2 Deep 2 Plunge.</i>

916
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,870
With the number two, each time,

917
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,116
- instead of... the word.
- Instead of the word.

918
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,396
Yeah, I get it.

919
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,590
It's funny.

920
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,871
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

921
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,230
So...

922
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,393
I just wanted to say
thank you again.

923
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,230
I couldn't have done it
without you.

924
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:38,958
Night.

925
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,715
Without me...

926
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,715
you wouldn't have been in danger
in the first place.

927
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,074
<i>I'm sorry about last time.</i>

928
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,800
I'm a bit of a control freak.

929
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,633
Ah. Really?

930
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,910
I hadn't noticed.

931
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,833
So, what's changed?

932
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,870
Well, I realized

933
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,153
that you're right,
you're the expert.

934
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,709
And I should
trust you.

935
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,000
And as scary as that is...

936
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,115
...there's something
much scarier.

937
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,309
I, um, I wake up...

938
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,636
...smell coffee.

939
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:23,877
It's nice.

940
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,157
I have breakfast

941
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,396
with my family.

942
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,273
Uh, we're happy.

943
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,037
At peace.

944
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,792
And then, a man

945
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,957
walks in
and shoots each of them.

946
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,232
Dead.

947
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,600
And I know this man because he's
somebody that I represented,

948
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,350
and I know that he should be
in jail, but he's not.

949
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,669
Because of me.

950
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,919
I just smile,

951
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,791
while my family is killed.

952
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,311
I don't move a muscle.

953
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,630
Because I'm the reason
that it's happening.

954
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,554
I'm the reason that he's free.

955
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,557
And then, I wake up.

956
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,754
It's a new morning.

957
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,198
I smell the same coffee.

958
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,712
Pour the same cereal.

959
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,274
And then, someone else walks in,

960
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,994
and shoots my family.

961
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,353
This time,
it's a different person.

962
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,317
Someone else I set free.

963
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,480
And I just...

964
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,312
smile again.

965
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,674
And I die inside again.

966
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,031
Over and over, and...

967
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,997
I don't know what it'll take
to stay out of that place.

968
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,472
I'm trying my best.

969
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,956
But I don't know
if it'll be enough.

970
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,954
Well, it's a very brave start.

971
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,639
Thank you
for saving my life, Cain.

972
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,433
I suppose we're even now.

973
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,589
Yet, this is still there.

974
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,351
Hmm.

975
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,876
This whole time, you've been
in a kind of Hell, too.

976
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,990
You still are.

977
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,716
I'm sorry.

978
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,800
I'm sorry, too, brother.

979
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,558
Your face is still
the face of my torturer.

980
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,030
Fair enough.

981
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,314
I guess we still
need some space.

982
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,431
That, we can agree on.

983
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,399
Ah, that was
quite civil, actually.

984
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,751
I know I promised to help you
end your curse,

985
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:26,671
but I'm afraid we need
to dissolve our unholy alliance.

986
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,150
Why?

987
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,831
The risk is too great.

988
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,311
I mean, I don't mind
putting myself in danger,

989
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,351
but the detective?

990
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:40,037
If she had died,
it would have been my fault.

991
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,999
But you're the Devil,
you always keep your word.

992
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,117
I do.

993
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,032
So I hope you understand how
difficult a decision this was.

994
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,191
And yet, oddly,
the easiest I've ever made.

995
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,675
Well, I'm not done.

996
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,114
Abel's how my curse started,
he's got to be the way it ends.

997
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,798
As long as he's alive,
I still have hope.

998
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,316
No!
