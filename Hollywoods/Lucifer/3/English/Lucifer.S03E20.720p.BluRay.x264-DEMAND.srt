1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,476
<i>- Previously on</i> Lucifer...
<i>- God cursed Cain</i>

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,796
because he killed
his own brother.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,911
<i>She's the key
to finally getting</i>

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,600
<i>- what I've always wanted.</i>
- Just wish I knew that

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,029
Pierce's intentions were pure.

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,435
If you want to take it slow,
that's okay,

7
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,994
but from where
I stand, I'm all in.

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,277
I told you not to
talk to Charlotte.

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,311
<i>She's a human woman</i>

10
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,840
who isn't ready to hear
what you have to say.

11
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,997
I was in Hell.
And that's insane.

12
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,276
Charlotte,
do you have a minute?

13
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,677
At this point,
things can't get any crazier.

14
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,230
<i>I am done with Earth</i>

15
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,840
in general.
I want to go home.

16
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,756
Last time I took someone
on a celestial Uber ride,

17
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,070
the detective almost died.

18
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,873
You're afraid
of your daddy?

19
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,993
You are gonna regret this.

20
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,873
I can help us both
get what we want.

21
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,595
Where's my money?

22
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,873
I just don't have it. I lost it.

23
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,239
What do you mean
you <i>lost</i> it? Where is it?

24
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,590
What do you want me to say?

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,832
9-1-1. What is your emergency?

26
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,477
- Hello? People are fighting in my house.
- Come on, Kevin.

27
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,756
Kevin, stop.

28
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,436
Oh...

29
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,750
Good morning,
Detective Decker.

30
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,360
- Good morning, Lieutenant Pierce.
- Hey.

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,638
Have you seen
the evidence closet?

32
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,793
Uh... no.

33
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,037
Wow.

34
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,231
This is a great closet.

35
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,470
And, um...

36
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,433
Oh, yeah.

37
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,116
Get some, Decker.

38
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,436
Look at that.

39
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,590
It's always nice
to start the day

40
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,916
nose to nose,
isn't it?

41
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,315
Speaking of,
you'll never guess

42
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,795
what happened to me
last night, Detective.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,992
What's that?

44
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,475
I woke up alone.

45
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,239
- And?
- It's funny because

46
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,880
I usually don't,
because I usually

47
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,549
have women over,
or men, or both for sex.

48
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,114
Okay.

49
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,874
Will he be

50
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,957
coming with you from now on?

51
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,389
Because he is killing
our banter.

52
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,670
Absolutely not, no.

53
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,439
Pierce and I only came...

54
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,597
drove together just
this one time.

55
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,637
One time.

56
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,069
- Right.
- Apparently...

57
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,239
the victim's from
a well-connected family.

58
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,397
The suits downtown want me
to keep them in the loop.

59
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,636
Don't worry,
I won't interfere

60
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,075
with the investigation,

61
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,670
- or the, uh, dream team.
- Uh-uh.

62
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,315
Now, if you'll
excuse me.

63
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,033
Okay. Shall we?

64
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,039
Uh... you have DNA
on your shirt.

65
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,316
What?

66
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,070
Oh... um...

67
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,514
Oh, weird.

68
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,835
Hey, Ella, what's up?

69
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,710
You tell me what's up, player.

70
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,080
So, dead guy?

71
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,236
There must be an I.D.

72
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,749
Right.

73
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,078
Here lies Kevin Winstead

74
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,476
of <i>the</i> Winsteads.

75
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,000
34 years old.

76
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,475
<i>The</i> Winsteads?

77
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,598
The wealthy real estate
family from New York.

78
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,513
Oh. So, what's he doing
getting killed

79
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,114
in such a crappy neighborhood?

80
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,959
Apparently, he rented
a room here.

81
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,629
Not sure why he would,
but Kevin

82
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,000
was notoriously the black
sheep of the Winstead clan.

83
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,839
Heroin addiction.

84
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,315
Although...

85
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,999
from the looks
of these healed track marks,

86
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,596
it appears that Kevin
might have gone clean recently.

87
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,154
Not an easy thing to do.

88
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,919
And, apparently,
a waste of his time.

89
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,911
What was the cause of death?

90
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,549
Gunshot wound to the chest.

91
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,831
- Shot during a home invasion robbery?
- Maybe.

92
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,117
But the killer never got
around to taking anything.

93
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,198
Got interrupted by
the house's owner.

94
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,517
<i>Oh, that poor boy.</i>

95
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,915
He seemed nice.

96
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,157
- Why don't you tell me what happened.
- I was sleeping,

97
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,317
and I heard glass breaking,

98
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,519
so I went down
to check it out.

99
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,955
And then I heard arguing.

100
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,953
Uh, what were they
arguing about?

101
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,278
The voices were muffled,
but I did hear someone say,

102
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,874
"Kevin, stop."

103
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,833
So, the intruder
knew the victim.

104
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,111
The former heroin addict
had nefarious friends.

105
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,113
- Shocking.
- Did you get

106
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,589
a good look at the guy?

107
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,315
He was wearing a mask.

108
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,273
I would be dead for sure

109
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,995
if God hadn't sent
that angel to protect me.

110
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,432
So, there was someone else

111
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,391
in the house.

112
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,437
Not another person.

113
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,154
An angel, who saved me.

114
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,635
It-it flew in here,

115
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,354
and it just chased
the evil man away.

116
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,633
I'm sorry, sorry,
it's just the only thing

117
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,236
my siblings would chase away
are a good time.

118
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,069
I have proof.

119
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,671
The angel...

120
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,872
he took one
of my figurines.

121
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,356
Hmm? Gabriel.

122
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,551
Right.

123
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,837
Try lending him
some money.

124
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,599
Your tune changes
rather quickly.

125
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,836
Mrs. Hernandez,
why don't we get you

126
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,076
checked out
at the hospital?

127
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,193
- Thank you.
- Yes.

128
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,398
All right, let's do
a background check on Kevin.

129
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,034
Let's see if he had issues
with anybody.

130
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,794
Keep an eye out
for this angelic witness.

131
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,719
Hey, maybe it was
one of your brothers.

132
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,190
Seriously, is it
one of your brothers?

133
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,675
Preposterous.

134
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,479
My Father doesn't
send my siblings down

135
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,751
to intervene in petty robberies in Pacoima.

136
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,437
He only sends them
to harass me.

137
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,757
Oh, and speaking of...

138
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,235
Hello?

139
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,071
Right, I'm here.

140
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,475
What's so dastardly
important?

141
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,234
Okay, Luci, I think
we made a mistake

142
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,990
revealing divinity
to Charlotte Richards.

143
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,551
We? It was your idea.

144
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,035
But now I'm having
second thoughts.

145
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,475
What if she
tells someone?

146
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,790
Oh, no, you're right.

147
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,715
'Cause then that person
might tell someone else,

148
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,957
who then might tell someone
else, which could lead to

149
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,915
absolutely nothing happening
'cause no one will believe her.

150
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,879
Okay, look, you
might not care, Luci,

151
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,032
but the concept of divinity
is too big

152
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,640
for humans to handle.

153
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,758
We don't know what she's
gonna do now that she knows.

154
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,195
And I don't care.

155
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,390
You're right.

156
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,473
Oh, question, brother.

157
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,600
You don't happen to know
if any of our siblings

158
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,830
might be in town?

159
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,440
Not that I'm aware of.

160
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,872
Ah.

161
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,911
Why?

162
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,156
Oh, it's probably nothing.

163
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,637
Just an old woman

164
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,150
in some unremarkable home
said an angel

165
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,595
broke into her house.

166
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,910
Saved her life.

167
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,793
Stole one of her
hideous figurines.

168
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,037
All that trouble for
one ordinary human?

169
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,117
Yeah.

170
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,671
I mean, it would have to be
one very bored

171
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,712
or deeply confused angel.

172
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,752
Yea...

173
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,759
I mean, there must be some sort
of reasonable explanation.

174
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,434
And you don't remember
how the figurine

175
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,909
- got into your bedroom?
- No.

176
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,759
I mean, maybe it's
a housewarming gift or...

177
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,875
or a sex toy.

178
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,475
Or a housewarming gift
sex toy.

179
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,750
I just...

180
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,314
And it's identical
to the one missing

181
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,670
- from that woman's house?
- Yes.

182
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,520
But it's coincidence, surely.

183
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,352
You've been complaining about
having weird dreams lately.

184
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,111
Including one where you
couldn't control your wings.

185
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,830
I've also dreamt I was
king of the centaur people.

186
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,673
Doesn't mean I'm gonna
start wearing horseshoes.

187
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,435
There have been instances
where people sleepwalk

188
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,280
when they're having difficulty
dealing with painful situations.

189
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,995
Or, inversely,
not dealing with them.

190
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,271
Is it possible you're
not dealing with something,

191
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,876
and, thus, <i>sleepflying?</i>

192
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,560
That's absurd. I mean,
what in the world

193
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,911
- could I not be dealing with?
- I don't know.

194
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,994
Chloe and Pierce, maybe?
Perhaps you're not as

195
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,556
okay with that relationship
as you think.

196
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,638
Look, I am not an idiot, Doctor.

197
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,674
Clearly, I don't
love them together,

198
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,837
But I'm also not
a 16-year-old

199
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,838
crying in my bedroom
with Adele on repeat.

200
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,993
And I'm definitely
not this angel.

201
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,031
And, I know just
how to prove it.

202
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,117
<i>This was nice.</i>

203
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,830
This was...

204
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,631
Crap.

205
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,955
Wow, not even remotely close

206
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,310
to what I thought
you were gonna say.

207
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,637
No, no, the time.
We got to go.

208
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,711
What? Why?

209
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,195
Trixie's gonna be home
any minute.

210
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,073
And you don't want her
to see me here.

211
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,959
Look, you're pretty much
the first person

212
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,355
that I've dated since Dan.

213
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,115
I haven't introduced Trixie
to anybody.

214
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,836
And I just don't want
to do that until I'm sure.

215
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,550
And it's not that
I'm not sure.

216
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,080
I just,
I-I want to be ready,

217
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,720
and I want to know.
You know?

218
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,671
Maybe I shouldn't
have said all that.

219
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,394
- Anyhow...
- What's the prob...

220
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,392
Listen, fast or slow,
whatever the speed,

221
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,716
I'm into this.

222
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,440
If you haven't
figured it out, Chloe,

223
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,437
I'm in...

224
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,555
I like you.

225
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,557
Sorry.

226
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,873
Oh, it's Lucifer.

227
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,436
- Of course it is.
- Got to go.

228
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,272
Ah!

229
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,112
Good, you're here.

230
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,549
We need to find the killer.

231
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,633
Is this that super
important thing

232
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,354
you said you needed
to talk to me about?

233
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,314
Yes, because this case is of the
utmost importance to me now.

234
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,271
- Really? Why?
- Because if,

235
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,755
in the miniscule realm
of possibility,

236
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,077
that crazy old lady did,
in fact, see an angel,

237
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,278
I need to prove that
the angel wasn't me.

238
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,597
I think I can help with that.
It wasn't you.

239
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,995
Well, I'm sure
you're probably right.

240
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,475
And when the killer
confirms as such,

241
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,431
I'll be one happy Devil.

242
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,790
So, come on, chop-chop.
What do we got?

243
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,556
Okay, two days ago,
Kevin checked out

244
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,996
of a high-end rehab
facility... Sunrise sands.

245
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,833
And according to this
incident report,

246
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,191
he got into a pretty nasty fight
with a fellow resident

247
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,756
right before he left...
a guy named Phil Goldstein.

248
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,395
Yeah, come on.
I'm driving.

249
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,435
I don't understand
why humans waste so much time

250
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,994
resisting their desires.

251
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,199
A rehabilitation center
for drugs and sex.

252
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,117
Mr. Goldstein?

253
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,310
Detective Chloe Decker,

254
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,716
LAPD. We'd like to ask
you a few questions

255
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,751
about Kevin Winstead.

256
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,799
The answer's yes...
he's a douchebag.

257
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,315
Did you know that
he was murdered?

258
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,480
No, but it's nice to get
good news for a change.

259
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,193
The admin office said
that you were gone

260
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,720
for a few hours
last night

261
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,479
during the time
of Kevin's murder.

262
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,353
So, would you like to
tell us where you were?

263
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,513
I went for a drive.
We're not prisoners here.

264
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,676
Can anyone confirm that?

265
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,950
If producing

266
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,760
nine legal shows
taught me anything,

267
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,791
it's that I don't have to
say jack without a lawyer.

268
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,592
If you'll excuse me
while I go take a crap.

269
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,956
- What are you doing?
- Actually,

270
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,634
Phil, I've had enough
of your crap!

271
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,797
Now, I know that you
killed Kevin Winstead,

272
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,992
and then an angel interrupted
your escape.

273
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,997
So, tell me,
what did he look like?

274
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,951
- Lucifer.
- Man, what the hell

275
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,196
are you talking about, man?

276
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,592
Did he look like me?!

277
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,830
Lucifer, stop.

278
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,076
I did not kill Kevin.

279
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,312
But you guys
did fight, right?

280
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,831
That is only 'cause Kevin took
this rehab stuff so seriously.

281
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,918
The rest of us?
It's a smoke screen.

282
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,600
Keep our wives and jobs at bay.

283
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,871
But Kevin wouldn't
shut up about

284
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,115
getting clean,
getting his family back.

285
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,630
He drove me nuts.

286
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,910
So I punched him.

287
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,356
Get his family back?

288
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,517
I... His parents are dead,
and he wasn't married.

289
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,949
I don't know about any of that.

290
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,436
Where were you last night?

291
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,551
Answer her.

292
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,671
Uh, uh...

293
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,870
Uh, with hookers.

294
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,394
That's why I'm in here.

295
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,991
I'm a sex addict.

296
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,200
- Ah.
- It's court-ordered.

297
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,197
Anyway, you know,

298
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,880
two steps forward,

299
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,880
one step back, right?

300
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,070
Hey, what was that about?

301
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,878
It's nothing.

302
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,951
That was not nothing.

303
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,272
Talk to me.

304
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,034
Look, I just haven't
been sleeping well.

305
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,913
That's all... but never mind
that, what's next?

306
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,636
What's next is you
take the afternoon off.

307
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,478
Get some rest.

308
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,194
What? I'd rather go
and find the killer.

309
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,113
It's not a suggestion,
Lucifer.

310
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,590
Look, I'm gonna spend
the rest of the day

311
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,870
poring through Kevin's file,

312
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,480
trying to figure out
who his family is.

313
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,717
We probably won't know anything
until tomorrow morning.

314
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,558
Tomorrow?

315
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,479
Go home. You're tired.

316
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,874
Okay. Fine. But,
only if I can borrow these.

317
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,560
Well, I promise
I'll bring them back.

318
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,837
Please don't.

319
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,472
Ew.

320
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,396
Luci.

321
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:48,872
Lucifer.

322
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,560
Wake up.

323
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,432
Ugh.

324
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,233
No offense, brother,
but on the list of things

325
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,477
I'd like to wake up to,
your face falls somewhere

326
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,151
after a horse's head
and Coldplay tickets.

327
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,073
I just came to show you this.

328
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,717
What...?

329
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,631
"The Angel of San Bernardino"?

330
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,760
See, I thought that maybe
one of our siblings

331
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,871
<i>was</i> in town.

332
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,991
But, Luci,

333
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,594
it appears that, uh...

334
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,236
I am the angel.

335
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,118
"Witnesses say
the unknown samaritan

336
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,760
"appeared to have wings.

337
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,560
Sort of flew in like..."
This is ludicrous.

338
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,114
It-it can't be me.

339
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,437
Can it?

340
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,312
Luci.

341
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,556
Just look around.

342
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,035
Look at your hands.

343
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,471
I think it is you,
and I think it's all my fault.

344
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,639
In what possible way
is this your fault?

345
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,599
Because I made you show
your wings to Charlotte.

346
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,910
Reveal divinity.

347
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,474
And now, Father
is punishing us for it.

348
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,876
Look, Father making
me do angelic deeds

349
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,639
is a divine kick
in the nuts to <i>me.</i>

350
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,718
Well, my punishment
must be forthcoming.

351
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,791
- What?
- And who knows

352
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,275
in what form it will come.

353
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,989
Don't be ridiculous.
You or I aren't being punished

354
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,351
for Charlotte Richards,
same as I wasn't punished

355
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,920
for revealing myself to Linda.

356
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,520
Okay, well, then,
how do you explain all of this?

357
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,836
Well, it's obvious, isn't it?

358
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,952
It's just more manipulation.

359
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,913
Quite possibly, Dad's master
plan all along. I mean,

360
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,635
first, he makes me <i>look</i>
the part of an angel.

361
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,071
And then, he forces me
to act it in my sleep.

362
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,756
I don't know, Luci.

363
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,793
Well, if working
with the detective

364
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,793
has taught me anything,
it's that I need proof.

365
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,317
Only the killer can say
for certain if it was me.

366
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,670
So I'm off to work.

367
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,831
- Might have a shower and stuff first, huh?
- Yeah.

368
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,439
I'll get some takeout, because
being with you is the dessert.

369
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,157
It's a date.

370
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,430
Can't wait to
see you later.

371
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,876
# Dyingofcuteness.

372
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,396
How long have you been there?

373
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,235
Long enough to hear
how totally adorbs that was.

374
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,515
Sounds like things
are going really well.

375
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,354
They are. But...

376
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,317
But...

377
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,670
There's a "but" in there.

378
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,794
I think she's holding back.

379
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,992
She hasn't said the magic words.

380
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,991
What magic words?

381
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,157
You know.

382
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,234
Those three little words.

383
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,954
Rhymes with "my guv boo."

384
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,036
She hasn't said them, yeah.

385
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,038
You and I,
we're the same.

386
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,353
The rock that people break
themselves against,

387
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,519
and you know what happens
to rocks like us?

388
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,071
When we fall, ooh,
we fall really hard.

389
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,194
Kind of
a scary place, huh?

390
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,116
But don't worry, LT.

391
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,717
When the time is right,
she'll say them.

392
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,679
And, when she finally does...

393
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,714
Everything will change.

394
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,200
I'm counting on it.

395
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,235
Hmm.

396
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,997
Your casserole tastes
like roadkill.

397
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,756
Oh, and you.

398
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,793
Stop telling stories
about your children,

399
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,599
'cause no one cares.

400
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,395
Hmm, Sally.

401
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,477
Oh, Charlotte.

402
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,034
It's not the clothes
that make you look fat.

403
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,196
It's the fat.

404
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,390
- Ugh.
- Yeah.

405
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,115
Oof. And you.

406
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,640
You are pretty great, actually.

407
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,113
Uh, thanks?

408
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,110
And you.

409
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,552
You are coming with me.

410
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:05,872
Okay.

411
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,752
Mrs. Bell,
this is a copy

412
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,235
of your son's birth certificate.

413
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,432
It says that Kevin Winstead
is the father.

414
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,439
Kevin and I dated years ago.

415
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,750
We were going
to get married

416
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,031
after I got pregnant
with Jackson.

417
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,349
But I called it off
at the last minute.

418
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,712
- Jackson, stop.
- Oh, no, no, no!

419
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,435
- No, no.
- No, no, no!

420
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,960
- Get off the floor.
- I got it.

421
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,117
Yeah, and people choose
to procreate.

422
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,152
I'm afraid my son
has Kevin's temper.

423
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,352
But you are

424
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,392
the one with
the assault charges.

425
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,359
I did my share
of drugs with Kevin.

426
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,589
I'm not proud of
who I was then.

427
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,472
Right.

428
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,750
The drugs made you wild.

429
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,032
Which is why I stopped using.

430
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,629
But Kevin liked getting high
more than he loved me.

431
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,432
Our relationship
became toxic.

432
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,591
So I left.

433
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,236
And when was the last time

434
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,954
- you spoke to Kevin?
- It's been years.

435
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,595
'Cause it says here
on the phone records

436
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,439
that he called here
three months ago?

437
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,438
Every now and then,
he would call, asking for money.

438
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,080
For drugs.
So, whenever I would see

439
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,475
his name on the caller I.D.,

440
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,319
I would just hand
the phone to Jeremy.

441
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,989
And did Kevin mention having
trouble with anyone?

442
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,156
A drug dealer, maybe?

443
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,191
Last time we spoke, he said

444
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,470
he owed somebody a lot of money.

445
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,270
I didn't care
to ask who.

446
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,680
Right. Well, I'm not saying this
was a complete waste of time,

447
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,439
but... it was.

448
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,519
Mm. So... so then,

449
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,911
I said, "You can
stick that brief

450
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,476
in the circular file
under your robe."

451
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,719
It's his butt.

452
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,400
Aren't you worried
about the fallout?

453
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,956
I had a big revelation recently,

454
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,995
and it's completely
changed my perspective on...

455
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,676
well, everything.

456
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,276
It's liberating.

457
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,272
Another round.

458
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,630
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no.

459
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,990
No, thank you.

460
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,390
- I should go.
- Relax.

461
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,233
You only live once.

462
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,436
Or...

463
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,399
twice, in my case.

464
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,155
Look, I would love to,
but if I show up back to work

465
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,829
completely hammered,
there's gonna be hell to pay.

466
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,076
I got you covered.

467
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,112
I'll put in a word
with the big guy.

468
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,312
With Pierce?

469
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,119
No, think bigger.

470
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,077
The commissioner?

471
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,076
It's an anadrome for D-O-G.

472
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,391
I love how weird you are.

473
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,476
But I should go.

474
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,276
Or, you could duck
into that closet,

475
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,834
take off all your clothes.

476
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,350
I'll go freshen up.

477
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,069
Meet you in there.

478
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,800
Then, do the same.

479
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,273
That's really not a good idea.

480
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,471
Come in.

481
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,672
Oh.

482
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,757
What are you doing in here?

483
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,111
Uh, I'm... was...

484
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,359
- I'm calling the police.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

485
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,074
Don't do that,
don't do that, please...

486
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,160
I am the police.

487
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,635
If I could just, um...

488
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,351
Right there.

489
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,198
I don't understand.
Why is it taking so long

490
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,357
to find Kevin Winstead's
drug contacts

491
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,914
on your computer thingy?

492
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,278
It's easier said
than done, Lucifer.

493
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,470
Well, the man is a degenerate.

494
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,632
He must have been arrested
a thousand times.

495
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,719
Rich families like the Winsteads,
they're all about appearances.

496
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,752
And they've been covering
Kevin's run-ins with the law

497
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,280
since he was a teenager.

498
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,319
Look, getting a hit,
it might take some time.

499
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,717
So why don't you go home,
get some sleep and...

500
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,195
Look, I can't.

501
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,669
Why?

502
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,076
Because if I am
this Angel of san Bernardino,

503
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,039
and I go to sleep,
then I might do it again.

504
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,680
Okay, well,
just don't sleep then.

505
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,109
Hold on.

506
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,913
That is an excellent plan,
Detective.

507
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,480
I'll just never sleep again.

508
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,912
Ah...

509
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,871
Oh!

510
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,833
Perfect. Harder.

511
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:20,992
Again.

512
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,271
Oh!

513
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,153
Come on!

514
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,079
Ha, ha!

515
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,116
Put the first layer in...

516
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,519
Another scavenger's coming...

517
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,116
Hey, Bones, look at that.

518
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,151
Mary, right?

519
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,750
Why do you care

520
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,753
about my relationship
with my father, Booth?

521
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,800
Look, I'm glad you called.

522
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,912
Um, but it's just gonna
take some time.

523
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,958
I'm still upset,
and so is Trixie.

524
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:08,997
I know.

525
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,311
I'm fine to take it at whatever
pace you need me to.

526
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,276
Fast or slow.

527
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,036
Whatever it takes.

528
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,276
Wait, what did you say?

529
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,994
"Fast or slow." Why?

530
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,395
It just... nothing.

531
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,319
Reminds me of something
someone else said.

532
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,518
Well, if you go
by someone else's pace,

533
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,513
it shows how much
you really care.

534
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,798
That's... incredibly insightful.

535
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,873
I learned it from sex.

536
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,116
That's more you.

537
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,114
All right, well, thanks, Maze.

538
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,277
Ha.

539
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,590
I got your text.

540
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,470
Where have you been all week?

541
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,076
- Has it been a week? Huh.
- Yes.

542
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,233
Um, hey, are you okay?

543
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,671
Yeah, I'm fine. Fine.
Rough night, juice cleanse.

544
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,032
So what have we got, Booth?

545
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,557
Booth?

546
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,558
Yes, the FBI agent on <i>Bones.</i>

547
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,399
- The TV show?
- Uh-huh.

548
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,876
Watched all 12 seasons.
It's riveting stuff.

549
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,514
It's like watching
a documentary of us.

550
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,190
Actually, you're
clearly Booth.

551
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,357
- I'm Bones, obviously.
- Obviously.

552
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,877
Kevin's autopsy report. Good.

553
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,400
Now, I've been thinking,

554
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,836
perhaps there was a slight
depression on the occipital,

555
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,197
or slight fractures
to the femur?

556
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,193
Did you know there were
206 bones in a human body?

557
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,238
Each of them a clue,
sometimes twice.

558
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,437
And the coccyx
is not what it sounds.

559
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,710
No coccyx.

560
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,270
What I did find
was surveillance video

561
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,040
of Kevin getting arrested
for possession a few months ago.

562
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,873
Oh, goody.

563
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,270
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

564
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,880
So who's his doltish

565
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,236
- sparring partner?
- Uh,

566
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,840
Matt Kessman,
per the arrest report.

567
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,272
- Kevin's dealer?
- Uh, I guess so.

568
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,596
I spoke to
Kessman's roommate.

569
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,236
He said he's "doing a job"
at the Vido Hotel right now.

570
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,193
- So if we hurry...
- Oh, so if we hurry, we could catch him in the act.

571
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,916
Yes, use it as leverage, get him
to talk about Kevin's murder.

572
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,119
Onward, Boothy!

573
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,951
Excuse me, everyone.

574
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,429
If I could have
your attention, please.

575
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,710
Oh, excuse me.

576
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,350
In the ER...

577
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,676
- Thank you.
- That's Matt Kessman.

578
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,792
...I fix people's hearts
with a scalpel.

579
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,395
Some say it's
a miracle.

580
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,995
The real miracle here

581
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,755
is how Sheila
fixed Kirby's heart.

582
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,198
Let's hear it for the
happy couple, huh? Cheers.

583
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,471
I find it strange
that a heart surgeon

584
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,110
has roommates, and that
he's slugging it out

585
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,913
in an alleyway with
a junkie.

586
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,998
Detective, I've seen
that man before.

587
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,111
What? Where?

588
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,993
He's the killer.
I'm certain of it.

589
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,680
- What?
- Yeah.

590
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,397
Thank you.

591
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,793
Stop what
you're doing. LAPD.

592
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,871
Tell me,
you murderous drug dealer.

593
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:52,918
Was it me?

594
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,755
Uh, drug dealer?
I'm a heart surgeon.

595
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,270
Don't even
try lying to me.

596
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,880
I know you killed
Kevin Winstead.

597
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,278
And I know you killed
that intern at the hospital.

598
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,756
Yeah. Burned her body.

599
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,160
Only her cranium was left in the
smoldering, smoldering ashes.

600
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,760
Lucifer.

601
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,157
Lucifer.

602
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:18,192
Are you talking about
an episode of <i>Bones?</i>

603
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,115
Wha...?

604
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,116
Oh, yes.

605
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,399
Oh, yes, no,
I suppose I am, actually.

606
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,640
Yes, episode 306.

607
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,513
"The Intern in the Incinerator."

608
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,276
Yes, of course.
You were quite good.

609
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,716
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yeah.

610
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,070
Yeah, that wasn't
an easy role.

611
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,549
I thought you were
a heart surgeon.

612
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,630
- Um...
- This is all my fault.

613
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,520
I don't have
many friends.

614
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,670
Any friends.

615
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,917
So I hired Matt

616
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,190
to be my best man.

617
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,471
Make it look like
I know fancy people.

618
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,480
Can I go back to my wedding now?

619
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,593
- Uh...
- Yeah, go ahead.

620
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,239
You were arrested at the park
for fighting with Kevin.

621
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,272
So why? Did he
owe you money? What?

622
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,593
We were fighting because he
wouldn't do any drugs with me.

623
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,191
Because that's the job
I was hired to do.

624
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,639
So I-I don't understand.
So Kevin was your drug dealer?

625
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,479
I'm an actor.
Times are tough.

626
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,160
I was hired
to be Kevin's friend.

627
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,794
Just like the groom.

628
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,957
But instead of giving
best man speeches,

629
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,237
I was supposed to keep him
nodding out.

630
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,990
Eh, partying.

631
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,079
Who hired you to carry out
this ridiculous charade?

632
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,070
No idea. I-I got the job
through the agency

633
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,350
that sets it all up.

634
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,433
They're called Masquerade, Inc.

635
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,315
Breaking and entering
will get you five years.

636
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,714
You'd have to catch me first.

637
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,278
So, you ready for me
to kill you yet?

638
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,714
No. And you can
stop asking me.

639
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,400
I'll let you know when
the brand is finally gone,

640
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,875
but don't worry,
I think it's soon.

641
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,395
Well, I did my part.

642
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,435
So what are we thinking?

643
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,073
- Pain or no pain?
- No pain.

644
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,953
I've had enough painful
death in my time.

645
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,591
Let's keep this last one
quick and clean.

646
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,799
No pain it is.

647
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,830
Not for you anyhow.

648
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,152
What?

649
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,200
Decker's the one
who's gonna suffer.

650
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,074
I got to admit, getting her
to fall for you, and then,

651
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,195
poof, vanishing... ruthless.

652
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,157
And that's saying something
coming from a demon.

653
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,596
Respect.

654
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,918
I don't care who I have to hurt,

655
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,632
as long as it allows me
to finally die.

656
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,680
"No family? No friends?
No problem."

657
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,634
And for a fee,
they'll send actors

658
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,753
to pose as family or friends

659
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,640
at public functions
for the sake of appearances.

660
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,791
- That's clever.
- Yeah, well,

661
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,638
it's creepy.

662
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,758
At least now we know
that whoever hired

663
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,429
that exceptionally talented
actor from <i>Bones</i>

664
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,798
may well be our killer. Hmm?

665
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,071
So, um...
It says, says here

666
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,795
the Masquerade office
is in Hollywood. I'm driving.

667
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,397
Lucifer.

668
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,833
I won't be able to get a warrant
until tomorrow morning.

669
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,394
No. No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

670
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,239
It-it is imperative
that we go now.

671
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,397
It's imperative that you sleep.

672
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,477
You clearly...

673
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,034
I can't sleep!

674
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,880
Detective, I can't sleep.

675
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,671
Lucifer.

676
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,709
- I've had it.
- What... you won't understand, really.

677
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,151
- Hmm?
- It's my wings. They're back.

678
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,874
My Father, he's manipulating me.

679
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,799
He's making me do things
that I would never do.

680
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,559
What? Like flying
through the night,

681
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,320
helping people
like some rogue angel?

682
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,710
- Yes! Yes, exactly!
- Uh-huh.

683
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,515
That is the only
plausible explanation.

684
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,552
Either that or Linda's right,
and I'm suppressing

685
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,275
pent-up feelings
about you and Pierce,

686
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,517
which is obviously absurd.

687
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,915
You hate that I'm with him.

688
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,834
I couldn't care less that you're
with that insolent dullard.

689
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,992
We both know that's not true,

690
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,272
but what I want to know is why
it bothers you so much.

691
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:24,000
Because, Detective, I happen
to know him better than you,

692
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,554
and I know that
you can't trust him.

693
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,916
Care to elaborate on that?

694
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,350
I... Yeah.

695
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,990
- Fine, I will, because you deserve to know the truth.
- Yes.

696
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,156
Yes, okay.

697
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,836
Pierce isn't Pierce.

698
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,713
He's Cain from the Bible.

699
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,718
And he's immortal.
He's been around for eons.

700
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,513
And all he cares about
is ridding himself

701
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,235
- of that stupid curse that my Father put on him...
- Stop.

702
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,874
- ...because he killed his brother.
- stop!

703
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,235
- You're tired, and you're not thinking clearly.
- No...

704
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,909
- No, I'm... it's not because I'm tired, Detective!
- And...

705
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,834
But since you
brought it up,

706
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:00,113
let me tell you what
I think about Marcus.

707
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,758
He is a good man

708
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,515
who treats me right.

709
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,597
And I'm happy, Lucifer.

710
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,714
And all I know is how I feel
when I'm around him,

711
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,832
and, you know, I I...

712
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,430
I...

713
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,036
We're done here.

714
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,357
<i>Seven carats</i>

715
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,472
of pure bliss.

716
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,190
Don't you deserve
a little indulgence?

717
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,311
I'll take it.

718
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,914
Hey.

719
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,432
You got a second?

720
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,836
For you, Amenadiel, always.

721
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,795
Don't go too far.

722
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,154
Dan called me.
He's worried about you.

723
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,559
Well, all is good.
In fact, it's better than good.

724
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,477
It's perfect.

725
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,758
Yeah, what about that
Spartan lifestyle?

726
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,795
What can I say? Things change.

727
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,117
And why is that?

728
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,396
Because when you know

729
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,034
a pair of angels that can

730
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,351
zip you up to Heaven
when the time comes,

731
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,074
worrying is a waste of time.

732
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,516
That's not how it works,
Charlotte.

733
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,151
- What do you mean?
- Okay, look.

734
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,680
Neither I nor Lucifer have the
power to get anyone into Heaven.

735
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,150
I don't have my wings,

736
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,033
and Lucifer, well,

737
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,191
he is, uh, most unwelcome.

738
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,278
So the only thing
that matters,

739
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,512
Charlotte, truly,
is who you are.

740
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,470
It's okay.

741
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,200
Nothing's changed.

742
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,677
No, don't you see?
That's the problem.

743
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,315
The second I thought
I had a free pass,

744
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,557
an excuse not to be good,

745
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,559
I relapsed into my old ways,

746
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,078
into who I really am.

747
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,597
There's no hope for me.

748
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,356
Amenadiel, I can't change.

749
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,319
I'm going to Hell.

750
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,389
- Mommy.
- Hmm?

751
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,273
Did you know if you're
ever mean to me,

752
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,752
I can just go on this site
and order a new mommy?

753
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,713
Oh, yeah? How you
gonna pay for that?

754
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,317
Your credit card.

755
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,989
I've gotten pretty good
at your signature, you know.

756
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,596
I don't doubt that.
All right, come on.

757
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,200
Let's go get some
pizza and ice cream

758
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,595
on the way home.

759
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,950
He seems nice.

760
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,790
He is nice. You know, Monkey,

761
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,436
since Daddy,

762
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,199
I haven't really dated anyone...
well, seriously.

763
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,278
And, uh...

764
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,717
Marcus and I,

765
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,595
we've been spending
a lot of time together.

766
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,714
And the truth is...
I like him, a lot.

767
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,072
And it's just so important to me
that you're okay with that.

768
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,471
Is he the reason
you've been so happy lately?

769
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,630
I think so.

770
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,116
Does he like chocolate cake?

771
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,640
You know what,
I don't know.

772
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,796
Let's ask him.

773
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,674
All right.

774
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,871
Oh, my God.

775
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,440
What is it, Mommy?

776
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,115
That's Jeremy Bell.

777
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,234
The husband we interviewed.

778
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,876
Hello?

779
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,150
Anyone there?

780
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,000
Trouble sleeping?

781
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,477
Mr. Morningstar,
what are you doing here?

782
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,673
Shh. It's probably best
not to wake your family.

783
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,794
Even though...

784
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,760
they're not your family.

785
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,680
I just came
from Masquerade

786
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,151
where a most cooperative
employee

787
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,192
helped me connect the dots.

788
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,550
So, you used to be an actor.

789
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,717
We're in L.A., everybody
used to be an actor.

790
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,674
Mm-hmm, but not everyone gets
such a cushy gig, do they?

791
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,958
Your so-called wife

792
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,279
worried she'd no longer
fit in with the classes

793
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,240
after she broke it off
with her deadbeat baby daddy,

794
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,877
hired you to play
husband and father.

795
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,879
Murdering to keep the gig?

796
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,998
That seems a tad method,
don't you think?

797
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,156
Murder?

798
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,949
Th-That's crazy.

799
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,631
All right, look,
you need to leave

800
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,552
or I'm gonna call the police.

801
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,951
Oh, please.
Spare me the theatrics

802
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,594
because I am in no mood

803
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,752
to hear the half-baked
recitation of innocence

804
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,158
by a, well, mediocre actor.

805
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,991
Was it mediocre acting

806
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,000
that got Mary to actually
fall in love with me?

807
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,079
And Kevin's reappearance
just put all that in jeopardy.

808
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,913
Yeah, I wasn't about
to let that loser

809
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,719
weasel his way back in here.

810
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,672
Just like I'm not gonna let you
mess it up, either.

811
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,349
Too bad you're trespassing.

812
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,391
What the hell?

813
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,239
Most kind of you
to admit your guilt.

814
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,556
The trying to kill me part,
less so.

815
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,996
Aah!

816
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,715
Now, tell me what
I really want to know.

817
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,396
- Am I the angel?
- What angel?!

818
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,199
Did I stop you
from killing that old woman?

819
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,278
What happened the night
you killed Kevin?!

820
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,709
Okay. I'll tell you.

821
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,275
<i>After I shot him, I ran out.</i>

822
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,590
<i>I bumped into that old lady.</i>

823
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,950
<i>But there was
nobody else there.</i>

824
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,755
She fell into some kind of
religious trance so I bolted!

825
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,360
She saw an angel!

826
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,914
- Was it me?!
- No! I...

827
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,194
<i>It was a-a shadow
from-from those figurines.</i>

828
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,880
With the figurines, the angel
figurines. Did you plant

829
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,230
- the figurine in my bedroom?!
- No, no.

830
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,874
<i>I-I touched one of them.</i>

831
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,032
<i>So I took it, but it had
my prints on it.</i>

832
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,674
I destroyed it right
after. I swear.

833
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,839
Then... how...

834
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,434
I was only trying
to protect my family.

835
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,277
It was never your family
to protect,

836
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,994
you pathetic imposter.

837
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,198
You stole it

838
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,959
from Kevin Winstead.

839
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,392
And then you kept him distracted

840
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,075
by hiring someone
to keep the party going.

841
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,431
Driving him
to self-destruction,

842
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,314
stoking the very fires
of his own weakness...

843
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,274
...to keep him out of the way.

844
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,119
How could I be so blind?

845
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,431
Jeremy Bell? LAPD.

846
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,200
It's all my fault.

847
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,713
I killed Kevin Winstead.

848
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,637
I am a pathetic imposter.

849
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,275
What are you doing?

850
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,030
I need to find it, Maze.

851
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,390
Find what?

852
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,431
Your self-respect?

853
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,200
The-the angel figurine.
It's here somewhere.

854
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,040
I-I need to find it
so that I can

855
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,277
convince the detective
that Pierce...

856
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,280
isn't who she thinks he is.

857
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,676
What? I don't understand.
Explain.

858
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,755
I figured it out, haven't I?

859
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,599
Pierce has been
gaslighting me.

860
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,836
He's been tricking me
into thinking

861
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,794
I've been doing good deeds
in my sleep.

862
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,911
Why would he do that?

863
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,117
Because...

864
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,034
to keep me away
from the detective

865
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,515
so he can pursue her.

866
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,837
He must be back to thinking
that she's the key to lifting

867
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,917
his bloody curse.

868
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,190
I mean, I tried to warn her,

869
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,033
but she wouldn't
listen, would she?

870
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,555
And why wouldn't she listen?

871
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,274
Because the detective
always needs proof.

872
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,915
And what better proof than
that trinket that he used

873
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,958
to-to-to deceive me?

874
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:13,798
Wait.

875
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,757
If you want Chloe
to believe you,

876
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,034
you have to do it right.

877
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,796
Take it to Ellen.
Have her do her lab thingy.

878
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,320
Yes, yes, you're right.

879
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,797
First, back up.
Tell me everything.

880
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,793
Start at the beginning.

881
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,400
And don't leave
a single thing out.

882
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,310
It's just...

883
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:37,279
so hard to put everything
together in my mind, Maze.

884
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,239
I mean, you-you
wouldn't understand.

885
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,676
Thank you.

886
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,916
That's very kind of you.

887
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,431
Which is not like you at all.

888
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,960
Why are you even here?

889
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,029
You're helping him.
Aren't you?

890
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,594
"Helping him"?

891
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,555
This was <i>my</i> idea.

892
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,229
After Pierce told me

893
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,000
about that old lady who
thought she saw an angel,

894
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,157
that's when it all
came together.

895
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,879
I planted the figurine
by your bed.

896
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,639
My neck... is still jacked
from wearing those fake wings

897
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,830
to save that dumb family

898
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,599
in San Bernardino.

899
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,992
You came this close
the other night to waking up

900
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,993
after I took those
handcuffs off.

901
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,513
Thankfully, handcuffs in bed,
I got that.

902
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,951
Why would you do this to me,
Mazikeen?

903
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,120
Because I know
the only thing

904
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,357
that matters to you
more than Chloe.

905
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:46,996
You.

906
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,877
Easiest way to spin you out.

907
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,192
Tap into those daddy issues.

908
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,712
"I can't get rid
of my wings.

909
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,755
Daddy's controlling me."

910
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,432
Wah, wah, wah.

911
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,996
You're stalling me.

912
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,760
Aren't you?

913
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,315
I need to get to
the detective!

914
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,118
Hi.

915
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,959
What do you have?

916
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,513
You're lucky you're cute

917
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,118
because I hate surprises.

918
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,071
Come on.

919
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,157
Let me see.

920
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,238
To celebrate solving a murder.

921
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,231
Mm, my second favorite
kind of six-pack.

922
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,120
Thank you.

923
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,874
And this.

924
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,517
I'm more of a key
lime pie guy myself,

925
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,235
but every proper bribe
requires self-sacrifice.

926
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,597
Trixie is
gonna love this.

927
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,597
- It's her favorite.
- Hmm.

928
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,756
She's at a birthday party
right now.

929
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,110
Oh, birthday party.

930
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,192
Maybe she's already had
enough cake for the evening.

931
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,156
Well, then maybe we can
all share it together

932
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,476
tomorrow morning
for breakfast.

933
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,831
You mean I don't have to sneak
out of the house in the morning

934
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:10,996
like a teenager?

935
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,429
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you sure?

936
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,671
Oh, I'm sure.

937
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,839
Yeah. I-I'm done
walking on eggshells.

938
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,875
I'm done worrying about how this
affects everybody else

939
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,232
because the way that
I feel about you is...

940
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,158
just... don't get
a big head.

941
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,119
All right?
We're both adults

942
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,953
and it's not
that big a deal.

943
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,032
But anyhow, here it goes.
Um...

944
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,833
I... really...

945
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,710
like spending time
with you.

946
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,360
And I know why.

947
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,950
Because, Pierce, I I...

948
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,071
Stop.

949
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,910
I can't do this.

950
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,913
What? Wait, no.

951
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,150
Marcus, don't freak out.

952
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,874
I mean, I know that
this is scary,

953
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,719
but sometimes you-you just

954
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,559
have to take a leap of faith.
You know?

955
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:00,792
Hold on.

956
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,911
Did something happen?

957
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,555
Did... is it
something I did or said?

958
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,673
Because, look,
we can take this slow.

959
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,836
I just thought that...

960
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,156
You're just making
this too hard.

961
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,277
What?

962
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,311
It's not worth it.

963
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,680
I'm not worth it?

964
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,280
- I have to go.
- What?

965
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,316
Why?!

966
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,190
Why did you hurt her? Why?!

967
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,638
For the first time, I had it.

968
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,115
It was right there in my grasp.

969
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,318
The one thing I always wanted.

970
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,555
It was so close.

971
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,798
I just had to have her
say the words.

972
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,356
But I couldn't.

973
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,360
I couldn't do that to her.

974
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:50,957
I couldn't...

975
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,360
...hurt her like that.

976
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,752
Well, you hurt her plenty.

977
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,191
And now?

978
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,993
I'm gonna hurt you.

979
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,912
Get up. Come on.

980
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,117
You do what you have
to do, Lucifer.

981
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,630
I deserve it.

982
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,636
Your mark...

983
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,036
it's gone.
