1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,549
<i>- Previouslz on</i> Lucifer...
- There's only room for one

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,240
immortal in the detective's
life, and that position's

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,470
- already been filled.
- By you?

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,319
The detective and I are a team.
There's just no room for a third.

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,080
- You're a good man.
- You deserve someone

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:11,958
who's gonna let you in,

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,594
and I want to do that if
you'll give me the chance.

8
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,871
Mom! Lucifer said
that you were gone.

9
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,713
Do I know you?
You know Lucifer.

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,070
You do know me.

11
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,191
And I am sick

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,312
<i>of your Goody Two-shoes ex-wife</i>

13
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,239
<i>and that stupid
little brat of yours.</i>

14
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,954
Charlotte Richards is back.

15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,436
<i>I think that mazbe she deserves
to know the truth.</i>

16
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,915
She's not so easily won over.

17
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,998
You are totally
freaking out right now.

18
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,034
- What?
- About this coming between you and Chloe.

19
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,469
Don't be preposterous.

20
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,879
Bloody hell!

21
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,072
Easy, Maze! Gah.

22
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,078
Could have taken my eye out
with that spatula.

23
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,836
What on earth are
you looking for?

24
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,759
And... why are we
meeting here, anyway?

25
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,713
- I heard you moved out.
- I did.

26
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,350
I forgot my knife.

27
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,950
Must have...
left it here somewhere.

28
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,111
Oh, no,

29
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,477
not one of your hell-forged
blades... that <i>is</i> a loss.

30
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,478
Not a blade. A knife.

31
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,191
Forged in...
I don't know, China.

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,993
Ah. Right, priceless.

33
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,680
I can't find it anywhere.

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,560
Green tea coconut water.

35
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,476
Worth the trip, at least.

36
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,040
You can't find
this stuff in Hell.

37
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,071
What do you mean, Hell?

38
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,875
I am so done, Lucifer.

39
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,079
I am done
with this apartment,

40
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,509
all humans...

41
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,870
Earth, in general.

42
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,758
I want out. Now.

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,956
I want to go home.

44
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,158
You...

45
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,399
you want me to fly
you down to Hell?

46
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,035
For good? That's a
bit rash, isn't it?

47
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,391
No, it's not.
And I've made up my mind, so...

48
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,556
get your wings out.

49
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,796
- No biggie.
- Wrong.

50
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,231
Big biggie. Huge biggie.

51
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,318
I don't know if you remember,
Maze, but last time

52
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,159
I took someone on a
celestial Uber ride,

53
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,589
the detective almost died.

54
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,714
Seriously?

55
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,351
You're... saying no because
you're afraid of your daddy?

56
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,354
No, I just don't want
anyone to get hurt.

57
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,559
Look, you-you clearly need to
blow off some steam, don't you?

58
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,035
Take your mind
off Ameninda?

59
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,239
No. Lindadiel?

60
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,675
Whatever.
That whole fiasco.

61
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,112
How about a nice weekend
in Catalina?

62
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,953
You went to Hell for Pierce,

63
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,469
a guy you don't
even like,

64
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,194
and you won't do
the same for me?

65
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,431
No.

66
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,194
I swear to you, Lucifer,

67
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,512
you are gonna regret this.

68
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,073
Are you threatening me,
Mazikeen?

69
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,999
Oh, hey.
Hey, guys.

70
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,997
What happened?

71
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,270
Don't worry, Detective.

72
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,676
Maze was just leaving.
Weren't you?

73
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,472
Oh.

74
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,710
Wait, wait, hold on.
Maze, Maze, um...

75
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,754
you know, I've been trying
to explain to Trixie

76
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,636
that there must be some reason
why you hurt her feelings.

77
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,150
You know,
some misunderstanding.

78
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,630
Or at least, I hope.

79
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,717
No.

80
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,634
I just forgot some of
my stuff. That's it.

81
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,991
Maze.

82
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,357
Look, I never asked you
to move out.

83
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,078
Can't you see that you're
doing this to yourself?

84
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,155
So now this is my fault?

85
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,155
Maze, come on.

86
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,237
Demons. Am I right?

87
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,479
Lucifer, name-calling
isn't gonna help.

88
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,357
Um, maybe you
should go talk to her.

89
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,277
You know?

90
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,512
Like now.

91
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,830
Well, I'd rather not, Detective.

92
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,838
It seems like she needs space.
Miles of it.

93
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,316
Well, now's not the best time...

94
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,516
...for you to...

95
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,678
Hey.

96
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,791
Lucifer.

97
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,676
Hello, Lieutenant.

98
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,832
What, uh... what
are you doing here?

99
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,598
Uh...

100
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,360
I mean, I suppose I knew you
two were becoming friendly...

101
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,994
I just didn't expect
to see you here.

102
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,676
On a weekend.

103
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,793
Wearing open-toe,
non-work-related Birkis.

104
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,076
We were at the beach.

105
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,478
Yeah.

106
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,717
To a beach... murder.

107
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,191
There was a murder...
at the beach.

108
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,558
New case.
I-I was gonna tell you.

109
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,792
But I didn't because
I know how much you...

110
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,116
hate...

111
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,271
sand.

112
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,199
Right.

113
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,756
Body's in the ice chest, is it?
I'm sure Ms. Lopez will have

114
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,155
something to say about that.

115
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,840
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

116
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,315
Well, then, um...

117
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,074
...best of luck
with your beach murder.

118
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,914
Do you want to stay, or...?

119
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,431
Beach murder?

120
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,633
I'm sorry. I-I-I panicked.

121
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,878
'Cause he's a coworker, and,
you know, you're a coworker.

122
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,793
Maybe we should talk
about some work...

123
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,634
life boundaries...
Besides, I didn't know

124
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,672
if you wanted everybody to
know that we were dating.

125
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,790
I don't care who knows.

126
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,392
You don't?

127
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,910
No. If you want to take it slow,
that's okay,

128
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,998
but from where I stand,
I'm all in.

129
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,277
So, I was getting coffee,
minding my own business,

130
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,954
and a guy grabs my arm.

131
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,073
Really?
What... kind of guy?

132
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,999
A tall, serious black man.

133
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:01,958
Bald.

134
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,471
Bald, like, in a...
in a very sexy way?

135
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,399
Yes. You know him?

136
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,636
Uh, no. No.

137
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,593
Just, um, painting
a picture.

138
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,599
I can... I can
see it all now.

139
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,440
Well, he called me Mom.

140
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,719
Said some really
strange things.

141
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,917
Sounds like a real nut bar.

142
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,954
It's a good thing
you're not gonna see him again.

143
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,230
That's the thing.

144
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,271
He came back.

145
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,358
- He did?
- Then he claimed

146
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,991
that he could fill in
what happened in my memory gap.

147
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,035
What he said then
was truly bizarre.

148
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,072
Yeah, well, he should have
left well enough alone.

149
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,713
Whoever he is.

150
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,954
Maybe you should
just forget about it,

151
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,516
keep moving forward,
like you've been doing.

152
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,313
You have to hear
how crazy it was.

153
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,597
He said Lucifer was his brother.

154
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,954
Which I guess is possible
if one of them were adopted.

155
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,080
And raised
with a different accent.

156
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,800
- Yeah, it's...
- Then he said

157
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,680
I was his stepmom.
But he's a grown man.

158
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,513
I mean, his father
would have to be ancient.

159
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,359
Oh, right. I...

160
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,280
I mean, as if I would go
running around marrying old men

161
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,437
and then forgetting
all about it.

162
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,117
Would I?

163
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,596
Charlotte, I don't
think this man,

164
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,400
whoever he is...

165
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,912
has your best interests
at heart.

166
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,795
That's the thing.

167
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,511
He seemed
to really care about me.

168
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,792
At least... who I was then.

169
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,559
This man wasn't lying.

170
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,359
At least he believed...

171
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,037
he was telling the truth.

172
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,636
Which means...

173
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,350
I should dig a little deeper
into his story. Right?

174
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,437
Right.

175
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,274
She's being really
self-destructive.

176
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,039
I mean, she's losing
all of her friends.

177
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,119
Maze is definitely
spiraling out of control...

178
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,071
I'm worried about her.

179
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,953
She gets like this sometimes.

180
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,959
Maze just needs to blow off
some steam, that's all.

181
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,994
I told her so myself, and I'm
quite sure she'll see sense.

182
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,236
Thanks.

183
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,558
Hey, Ella.
What do we have?

184
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,000
Mid-30s, male,
multiple stab wounds.

185
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,312
No ID, so... I'm gonna run
his prints through IBIS.

186
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,715
Right. Detective,
do you think

187
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,071
- this might be related to <i>your</i> beach murder?
- Ugh.

188
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,600
I hate beach murders.

189
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,555
So mean. It's, like,
just let people swim.

190
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,432
Mm.

191
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,717
Um, there was
no beach murder.

192
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,353
Ah. So what was Pierce
doing at your house, then?

193
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,836
We had a date.

194
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,351
Right.

195
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,400
Right. I thought as much.

196
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,759
Bully for you, Detective.

197
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,634
Uh, did I mention the vic
was male? And, uh,

198
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,990
would you look
at those earlobes?

199
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,793
So big. Huge. Huge earlobes.

200
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,912
Which tells me absolutely nothing.
But I can keep going.

201
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,794
And the gunsho... Ooh, look!
Oh, wait, looky there.

202
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,957
Oh. Security camera.
Okay.

203
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,958
I'll see if there's,
uh, footage of the crime.

204
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,756
Oh, let it out, buddy.
Even though Pierce and Decker

205
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,077
are totally hot together,
I know change is rough.

206
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,873
Ms. Lopez, please. Enough.

207
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,554
- Thank you.
- Lucifer...

208
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,399
okay, you and Chloe

209
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,478
have this undefined
something or other, okay,

210
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,114
that I never
really understood.

211
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,630
It's-it's on a...
a whole other plane.

212
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,758
Even though Pierce
and Decker, I mean,

213
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,112
whoo-ee, what gorgeous babies those
two would have, or die trying...

214
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,672
But I'm sorry
this is rough for you.

215
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,394
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

216
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,915
I'm more than fine, actually.

217
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,440
I mean,
those two dating

218
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,438
was practically
my idea, so...

219
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,472
Can we...?

220
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,473
- Uh, yeah, so...
- Guys.

221
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,470
We got something.

222
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,158
Yeah.

223
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,677
Oh, no.

224
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,230
That isn't...

225
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,751
You told her to
blow off some steam?

226
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,359
Well, I was really hoping
she'd choose Catalina.

227
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,116
There's no sign of Maze
at any of the usual spots.

228
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,754
And she's not
answering my calls.

229
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,593
Most definitely the actions
of an innocent woman.

230
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,120
Well, let's not jump
to conclusions.

231
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,879
It's not like the
video shows her

232
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,309
actually stabbing our vic.

233
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,636
No. Merely plucking

234
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,473
her knife out of his chest.

235
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,275
Do you really think
she did this?

236
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,273
I mean, yes, Maze is rash...

237
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,800
Or nuclear, more like.

238
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,320
There's got to be
another explanation.

239
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,874
There is. It's about me.

240
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,390
Maze asked me to take
her home, and I said no,

241
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,869
at which point she
flew into a rage

242
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,036
and threatened
to make me sorry.

243
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,833
So she's clearly acting out.

244
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,713
But if she thinks
she can manipulate me

245
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,957
into changing my mind,
then she's sorely mistaken.

246
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,958
So you didn't give her
a ride home one night.

247
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,231
I mean, call me crazy, but
that doesn't make someone kill.

248
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,231
Hey.

249
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,956
Hey there, Lieutenant.

250
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,509
Um... any updates?

251
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,677
Mm-hmm. Our vic
is an ex-con

252
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,870
named Mike Biltz.

253
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,679
Hmm. An active bounty
of Mazikeen Smith.

254
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,831
- Hmm.
- Well, Maze bounties

255
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,150
a lot of people, you know.

256
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,874
She's a overachiever, that Maze.

257
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,275
She's had a prior run-in
with him.

258
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,880
It says she brought him in
once before.

259
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,878
So she knows him...
it doesn't mean anything.

260
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,151
Or one very obvious thing...
guilty.

261
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,472
Chloe, is this case
too personal for you?

262
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,712
Maybe your roommate
isn't who you think she is.

263
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,673
- Ex-roommate. I'm just saying.
- All right,

264
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,070
well, I'll need you
to stay impartial.

265
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,277
Copy that. I'll keep it
completely professional.

266
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,670
Whereas I, on the other hand,

267
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,553
will keep things
entirely personal.

268
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,400
I will not rest until we track
down that manipulative demon.

269
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,557
In fact, I'm gonna go and
look for Maze again now.

270
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,633
All right. Great.
I'm gonna check out a lead

271
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,672
on our vic's last place
of employment... some winery

272
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,031
- called Monte De Oro.
- I'll go with you.

273
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,032
Okay.

274
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,038
Uh, no need, Lieutenant.

275
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,515
Actually, on second thought,

276
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,074
I think I should
make 100% certain

277
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,476
of Maze's guilt before
I find and punish her.

278
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,991
Come on, partner.

279
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,436
Okay.

280
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,359
Hmm. We'll take
my car, shall we?

281
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,355
So romantic, the California
coastline, isn't it?

282
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,633
- Yeah. Yeah, it really is.
- Mm.

283
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,959
Speaking of...

284
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,436
That beach date
that you went on with Pierce,

285
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,869
was it a <i>date</i> date?

286
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,233
Um, it was just
a regular date.

287
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,317
Ah.

288
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,040
Well, you're free
to spend your...

289
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,993
your spare time
with whomever you choose.

290
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,078
I mean, I'm not one
for gorilla-sized ham hands

291
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,671
or stale alcohol breath or,
yeah, just the general blokes,

292
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,560
but I suppose there's no
accounting for taste, is there?

293
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,234
No. No, there's not.

294
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,920
No... also, I-I'm surprised

295
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,396
that you'd date someone
so on in years.

296
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,269
Huh? What are you
talking about?

297
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,359
Oh, believe me, Pierce is, uh,

298
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,592
well, he's much older
than he looks.

299
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,235
And we all know that dating
older men has its downsides:

300
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,233
performance, stamina,
you know, the important bits.

301
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,231
Okay, Lucifer...

302
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,437
Well, I just hate to see you
unsatisfied, that's all.

303
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,950
Lucifer, I'm not
discussing this with you.

304
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,310
- Okay, okay.
- Okay?

305
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,637
Besides, Pierce and I,
we're not even sleeping to...

306
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,836
You know, we're not...

307
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,156
We're not, and never mind,
and it's none of your business.

308
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,760
So, how far are we?
Are we there?

309
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,633
Uh, we're nearly there.

310
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,557
Okay.

311
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,317
Thank you for talking
with us, Mrs. Channing.

312
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,318
Please, call me Margo.

313
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,635
Tragic news.

314
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,520
We want to help any way we can.

315
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,355
Great. Um, well,
what can you tell us about Mike?

316
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,477
Well, Zack would know better.

317
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,679
He's the winery foreman
and Mike's supervisor.

318
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,155
- Okay.
- He was a good worker.

319
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,159
Quiet. Never gave
us any trouble.

320
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,437
Mm-hmm. And did you all know
he had a criminal record

321
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,960
and that he was currently
out on bail?

322
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,794
No, I wasn't.

323
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,434
It's always the quiet ones,
isn't it?

324
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,190
The truth is,

325
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,358
if we looked too closely
at all our workers,

326
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,835
there'd be no one left
to tend the grapes.

327
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,833
Way I saw it, Mike
was a good guy.

328
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,276
He deserved better.

329
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,791
And did you notice anything
strange in the last few weeks?

330
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,791
Uh, any fights

331
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,077
that he got in or money
troubles? Anything like that?

332
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,875
Well, there was
something the other day.

333
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,150
Someone came looking for him.

334
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,034
Ah, was it a...
a hot woman, perhaps?

335
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,993
Angry? Leather? Lots of knives?

336
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,793
Or someone completely different?

337
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,310
- Like a dude? Like a fat, happy dude?
- No.

338
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,671
What he said.

339
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,190
A pretty woman in black leather
came looking for Mike.

340
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,551
Right. Well, Morningstar,
one, Decker, nil.

341
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,672
- Not that I'm counting.
- Anyhow, carry on.

342
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,360
Uh, Mike was out
at the time,

343
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,677
so she hung around his trailer,
then took off.

344
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,437
When I told him,
he kind of freaked out about it.

345
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,871
Then I forgot all about it.

346
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,478
Uh, could we get a look
at that trailer?

347
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,634
Oh. Oh, this is
lovely, isn't it?

348
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,116
Aha!

349
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,234
Her favorite beverage.

350
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,036
Well, surely this is evidence
that Maze is guilty.

351
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,555
And well hydrated.

352
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,397
Well, let's just wait
and see what the lab has to say.

353
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,035
I'm sure lots of people
drink green tea coconut water.

354
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,953
Right.

355
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,712
I told you not to
talk to Charlotte,

356
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,674
and you literally did the
exact opposite of what I said.

357
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,753
Why bother asking
for my advice at all?

358
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,997
I couldn't help it,
Linda, all right?

359
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,318
I'm sorry.

360
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,079
She's not your mother anymore.

361
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,079
She's a human woman in pain

362
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,754
who isn't ready
to hear what you have to say.

363
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,400
Well, I disagree.

364
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,190
She's in pain because
she doesn't know the full story.

365
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,359
Whether or not she's my mother,
Linda, I owe her the truth.

366
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,511
At least some of the truth.

367
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,394
I didn't go into
the celestial details.

368
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,593
And she can tell
you're holding back.

369
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,713
And now she has more questions.

370
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,670
I really thought we decided

371
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,109
we weren't gonna do this.

372
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,595
You mean <i>you</i> decided.

373
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,231
You decided, Linda.

374
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,557
Just like how you decided
that we were over.

375
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,276
Point taken.

376
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,954
But Amenadiel, please,
ask yourself...

377
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,917
are you doing this

378
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,476
because you think
it's what's best for Charlotte,

379
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,035
or what's best for you?

380
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,279
Oh, my God.

381
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,960
You guys are so adorable.

382
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,480
I can't even stand it.

383
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,160
Looks like you caught us, Lopez.

384
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,397
Uh, hey. Did you get anything
back on the coconut water?

385
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,798
Uh, no, but they are
rushing the order.

386
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,398
Chloe.

387
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,353
- Hey.
- Pierce.

388
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,196
I, uh, looked into

389
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,629
other known associates
of the victim.

390
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,069
Surviving family members,
etcetera.

391
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,237
- So far, no leads.
- Okay.

392
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,271
Oh.

393
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,916
Here, have a seat.

394
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,673
- Ah, lovely. Thank you very much.
- Yeah.

395
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,360
It's not like
there's 20 other chairs.

396
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,357
Ooh!

397
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,676
All warmed up for me.

398
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,360
So, any news
on our murderous friend?

399
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,596
Listen, guys, if Maze did this,

400
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,871
would any of you
really be shocked?

401
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,712
- Yeah.
- I would.

402
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,149
- No, not at all.
- There's no way.

403
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,960
Let me settle
it for you.

404
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,150
I did it.

405
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,358
What are you all waiting for?
I just said I did it.

406
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,397
Maze, hold on.

407
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,790
You have the right
to remain silent.

408
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,877
Anything you say

409
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,878
can and will
be used against you...

410
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,594
Don't have time for all of that.

411
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,474
I'm the big, bad killer,
so let's move it along.

412
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,000
Agreed. Let's book her.

413
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,634
Lucifer,
it's called due process.

414
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,717
She doesn't have to do this.

415
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,400
The evidence against her
is circumstantial.

416
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,751
Well, let me help you with that.

417
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,078
Murder weapon should do it.

418
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,119
Put it down. Now.

419
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,836
All yours.

420
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,029
Come on, boys.

421
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,909
You know you want to.

422
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,354
- Stand up.
- Oh.

423
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,710
Stand up.

424
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,509
I know this looks bad.

425
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,471
We have a video,

426
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,750
a murder weapon,
and a full confession.

427
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,437
I know. It just...

428
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,359
It doesn't feel like her.

429
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,550
I thought you said you weren't
gonna let your feelings

430
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,591
get in the way of this case.

431
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,757
- And I'm not.
- Just like you're not letting

432
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,553
your feelings for Lucifer
get between you and me?

433
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,194
W-What?

434
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,550
Is there something going on...

435
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,756
between you and Lucifer?

436
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,511
No. No.

437
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,871
Lucifer and I,
we-we're partners.

438
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,391
We're friends.

439
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,432
Do all your friends
give you jewelry?

440
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,557
This?

441
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,158
Lucifer gave me this as a joke.

442
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,396
It's a funny story, actually.

443
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,956
He says
it was the closest I ever came

444
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,480
to penetrating him.

445
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:19,912
Which, see,

446
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,952
we've never actually had sex.

447
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,791
- Oh.
- Never mind.

448
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,559
It just...
It was funny at the time.

449
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,120
Well, we're gonna book Maze.

450
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,232
If you really believe
she's innocent,

451
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,436
you're gonna have to bring in
the real killer.

452
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,279
I'll start by talking to her.

453
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,072
More talking?

454
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,516
Less of a conversation,

455
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,200
really, more of a "<i>j'accuse."</i>

456
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,909
We just want
to have a chat...

457
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,476
as friends,

458
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,552
- because that's what we are.
- Are we?

459
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,230
Let's talk motive,

460
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,671
because I cannot think
of a single reason

461
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,354
why you would want
to kill that man.

462
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,880
Who needs a reason?

463
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,150
I'm just evil.

464
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,314
I mean, that's
what you all think, right?

465
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,510
- No.
- Right.

466
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,235
Look, I've told you
already, Detective,

467
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,113
she is doing this
to manipulate me.

468
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,674
Well, newsflash, Mazikeen.

469
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,360
I am not taking you home.

470
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,319
Yeah, I heard you the first
time, and I don't care.

471
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,552
This way,
I'll end up in women's prison.

472
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,957
I heard it's hell on earth,
so close enough.

473
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,995
Right. Well, maybe
orange is the new Maze.

474
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,077
Perhaps some time in the clink

475
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,391
might actually make you sorry
for trying to control me.

476
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,795
What are you talking about?

477
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,150
She could get life in prison.

478
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,874
That's a mere time-out
in her lifespan.

479
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,151
All right, let's talk
about the actual crime.

480
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,396
Maze, tell me what happened.

481
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,757
I stabbed a guy.

482
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,717
See?

483
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,270
How many times?

484
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,630
Two or three.

485
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,590
Or four?

486
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,796
You're not even close.

487
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,434
The victim
was stabbed ten times.

488
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,391
Right, well,

489
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,556
I was mad,

490
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,154
so guess I forgot to count.

491
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,636
Did you happen to follow
the victim to a winery?

492
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,071
- Sure.
- Drink anything while you were there?

493
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,471
Wine.

494
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,390
- Now do you believe me?
- I believe you.

495
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,829
- Yes. I knew she didn't do it.
- Yes.

496
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,474
You know what
this means, Detective.

497
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,830
We need to bust Maze out.

498
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,509
Let's smuggle her something
she can use to escape.

499
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,799
- I...
- What happened to "a mere time-out" in women's prison?

500
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,838
Well, we can't punish
the innocent,

501
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,391
or even the usually guilty
but innocent this one time.

502
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,636
It's the principle
of the matter.

503
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,876
We have to find the real killer.

504
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,151
It's the only way
to keep Maze out of jail.

505
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,077
I hear someone's

506
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,317
headed for jail?
I'm ready to draw up

507
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,749
the arrest warrant
for Mazikeen Smith.

508
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,792
Hey, hang on.
I'll grab my paperwork.

509
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,160
I'd love to chat
with you, Lucifer.

510
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,353
Well, I'm terribly busy,
Charlotte. I'm sorry.

511
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,716
It's important.

512
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,719
Maybe somewhere
a little more private?

513
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,918
- Look, I-I really am in a bit of a rush, Charlotte.
- Of course.

514
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,157
I just wanted to mention
I met your brother, Amenadiel.

515
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,760
Oh, dearie me.

516
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,996
I bet that was a snooze.

517
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,079
So you confirm
that he's your brother?

518
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,750
Well, yes, of course.

519
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,600
Well, he had some
interesting things to say,

520
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,115
things that
you never mentioned.

521
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,200
For starters, would've been nice

522
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,437
to know that you were my stepson
before I kissed you that night.

523
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,960
"Stepson"?

524
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,514
- Right.
- Yeah.

525
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,313
That would've been far
preferable, Mum...

526
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,636
Mum...

527
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,599
- my dear Charlotte.
- You said "Mum."

528
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,591
Did I?

529
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,791
So I was...

530
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,236
I was your stepmom?

531
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,910
Well, not anymore.

532
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,039
Look, it... it's
complicated, Charlotte,

533
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,913
and I am horribly
crunched for time, so...

534
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,873
Tell me what you know,
and don't lie to me.

535
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,557
Please, Lucifer.
I feel like I'm going crazy.

536
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,557
Fine.

537
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,239
Fine, I suppose you do deserve
to know the truth.

538
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,791
Okay, then.

539
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,275
No sense dillydallying.

540
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,514
I really am the Devil.

541
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,513
My brother Amenadiel
is a former angel.

542
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,995
That time you thought
you survived

543
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,351
being stabbed by your
junior associate, you didn't.

544
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,552
You died, and your soul
went straight to Hell.

545
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,194
Your empty body
became a-a vessel

546
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,756
for my real mum,
the goddess of all creation,

547
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,076
until her celestial light

548
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,555
started bursting out
of your midsection.

549
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,029
Naturally, I sent her
to another universe

550
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,356
so she wouldn't
destroy this one.

551
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,960
Once she vacated your body,

552
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,879
you, Charlotte,
came back to life.

553
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,151
All right? There we are.
All caught up.

554
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,270
You wanted the truth?

555
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,556
Well, there it is.

556
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,597
Now, I really,

557
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,440
really must be going,
because I have an innocent demon

558
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,994
in the clink, but...

559
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,353
if you have
any follow-up questions,

560
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,319
please, do feel free to...

561
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,070
ask Amenadiel.

562
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,558
Maze.

563
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,430
How you holding up?

564
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,317
Never better.

565
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,797
What do you want?

566
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,275
I'm here to support you.

567
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,910
Okay, I-I will never,
ever forget

568
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,390
how you helped my brother,

569
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,234
so if there's anything you need,

570
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,920
anything at all, I'm your girl.

571
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,310
Even if I'm guilty?

572
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,438
Well, I don't think
that you are.

573
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,516
Even though there isn't

574
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,758
one shred of evidence
that exonerates you.

575
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,314
Like, nothing.
I mean, honestly,

576
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,398
I've never even seen
someone look more guilty.

577
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,397
But...

578
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,836
I have faith in you anyway.

579
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,232
Well, there is one thing
that you could do for me.

580
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,630
Yeah. Name it.

581
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,239
I could use a hug.

582
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,159
Like you even need to ask.

583
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,400
Bring it in!

584
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,471
Mm.

585
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,398
Oh!

586
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,994
- Oh.
- I was just on my way to find you guys.

587
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,278
Got the lab results back from
the green tea coconut water.

588
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,598
No match on the DNA,
unfortunately. It was...

589
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,757
- Demonic?
- Inconclusive.

590
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,035
But I did find a set of prints.

591
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,316
They were yours.

592
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,000
Well, if your
prints are on that can,

593
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,799
that means someone
must've broke into your house

594
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,559
and stolen it
from your wheelie bins.

595
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,640
- What?
- Your trash.

596
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,878
I assume you're the one
who throws 'em out for her.

597
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,470
And whoever stole the can

598
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,797
could've also stolen
Maze's knife. Which means

599
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,474
- someone's framing Maze.
- Someone's framing Maze.

600
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,433
You guys,
I'm really worried about her.

601
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,877
She's hurting.
When I hugged her just now,

602
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,036
she hugged me back.

603
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,318
She...

604
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,475
she hugged you?

605
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,595
Excuse me.

606
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,836
You supposed to be here, ma'am?

607
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,355
Ms. Lopez!
I've heard so much about you.

608
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,353
Only been here a couple weeks,
and everyone says

609
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,950
you're just an absolute ray
of sunshine.

610
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,911
Yeah, that's me.

611
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,679
Rainbows, science, God.

612
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,071
Oh, uh, uh, just need
your old, uh, John Hancock

613
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,920
and your security PIN, uh,
to sign out that file, you know?

614
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,031
Protocol.

615
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,760
How 'bout a hug instead?

616
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,839
- A Lopez hug?
- Mm-hmm.

617
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,476
Oh, I've heard about those, too.

618
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,996
Must-must be my lucky day. Uh...

619
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,192
Oh!
Oh, okay.

620
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,033
Um, getting kind of dizzy here.

621
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,671
Um, okay.

622
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,231
Pleasure to really meet you.
That other Ella was mean.

623
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,035
I can't believe
Maze used me.

624
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,795
She ruined hugging.

625
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,355
Uh, I'll-I'll take that.

626
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,552
Thank you.
Lovely.

627
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,191
Go easy on Maze,
Ms. Lopez.

628
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,035
What, like you did?

629
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,000
Uh, look, yes,
I admit I was a bit miffed.

630
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,396
But that's because I thought
Maze was manipulating me.

631
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,233
Now it's clear
she didn't kill that fellow,

632
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,591
it's obvious
someone is manipulating her.

633
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,598
Which is a terrible feeling,
by the way.

634
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,469
We need to help her.

635
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:23,918
Excuse me,

636
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,077
do you know what
she was looking for in here?

637
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,910
Maze wanted us to lock her up.

638
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,315
- Chloe...
- She's innocent.

639
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,840
The lab results
from the coconut water prove

640
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,871
that she's being framed.

641
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,350
Then why did she
turn herself in?

642
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,871
Because she needed something
from this file.

643
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,638
The booking sheet from
the vic's recent arrest.

644
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,637
Why is the corner missing?

645
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,718
Because that's where
the bail bondsman's name

646
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,997
and address was.
A guy named Barry Hill.

647
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,600
He's the one
who posted the vic's bail.

648
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,553
- What does she want with him?
- Okay, in order

649
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,194
to frame Maze,
someone had to convince her

650
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,232
to go to the crime scene,
you know, make her think

651
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,159
that she was tracking
a normal bounty.

652
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,915
That's where she found
Mike Biltz dead,

653
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:57,991
- with a knife in his chest.
- Yeah.

654
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,236
And pulled it out.

655
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,550
That's a pretty good frame job.

656
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,912
And since Barry the bondsman
hired Maze to find Mike,

657
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,873
he's probably the one
who set her up

658
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,753
or he probably knows who.

659
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,110
Wow.

660
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,797
Not bad, Decker.

661
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,754
Thanks.

662
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,277
Are we okay?

663
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,559
Yeah. Yeah, we're okay.

664
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,991
Uh, look, we'll talk about it
later. But I have to go.

665
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,072
Oh.

666
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,439
Sorry. Hate to interrupt
the canoodling.

667
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,552
Which I am so okay with.

668
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,194
It doesn't fill me
with mistrust at all.

669
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,039
But duty calls, Detective.

670
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,596
Can't have Maze taking justice
into her own hands now, can we?

671
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,231
- Mm-mm.
- No.

672
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,997
Okay.

673
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,958
Hey! Which one of you mid-life
crises is Barry Hill?

674
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,799
Get out of the lane, lady!

675
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,196
You're blocking the way of
the two-time league champs here.

676
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,789
You must be Barry.

677
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,671
You're coming with me.

678
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,316
Need to ask you a few questions.

679
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,676
Oh, well, you know,

680
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,473
I'll give you everything
you need.

681
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,916
After I roll.

682
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,390
So do me a favor, honey.

683
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,034
Just stay there
and look pretty, all right?

684
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,991
What gives?

685
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,720
7-10 split.

686
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,274
Gonna be hard to pick that
up with your face caved in.

687
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,959
Now, just stay there
and look pretty.

688
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,797
Okay! Okay, okay!

689
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,912
I'll tell you everything you
need to know! Ju-Just let me up!

690
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,352
Just let me up!

691
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,960
Lucifer told me... everything.

692
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,591
As in everything?

693
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,635
As in the whole freakin'
enchilada.

694
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,196
As in I was possessed
by the goddess of all creation.

695
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,309
But it's all good.

696
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,796
Because she's
in another universe.

697
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,717
And you believed him?

698
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,592
No.

699
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,591
Yes.

700
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,839
I don't want to.

701
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,433
I was hoping that
you could help clear things up

702
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,160
with one simple question.

703
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,510
What's my husband's name?

704
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,159
Um...

705
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,555
God.

706
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,236
Frey.

707
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,510
Godfrey.

708
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,792
- You're lying.
- Charlotte,

709
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,719
I don't know
what you want me to say here.

710
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,360
Um, the truth.

711
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,830
But a truth that makes sense.

712
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,350
Because right now, the only
thing that feels real to me

713
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,479
is that I was in Hell.

714
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,796
And that's insane!

715
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,800
I mean,

716
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,593
you can't actually be an angel

717
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,032
and Lucifer can't actually be
the Devil.

718
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,353
Because if I believed that,
then...

719
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,474
...then it would mean
that I'm insane.

720
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,350
Easy, lady!

721
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,710
Okay, what's this all about?

722
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,910
Don't play dumb.

723
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,232
You called me to bounty
Mike Biltz.

724
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,036
And funny thing
when I found him: he was dead.

725
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,158
Stabbed with one of my knives.

726
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,239
Security camera was a nice touch
though. Made me smile.

727
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,476
So why'd you set me up?

728
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,637
Okay, yeah. Okay,
someone-someone paid me

729
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,513
to call you, but I don't know
nothin' about any kni...

730
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,439
Who paid you?!

731
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,831
Some corporate guy called me.
I-I don't know who he was.

732
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,158
He said he worked for some place
called, um, Sebastian Corp.

733
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,510
Sebastian Corp?

734
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,518
What's that?

735
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,678
Well, I didn't see that coming.

736
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,753
Long-range round,
large caliber.

737
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,759
Barry here died
from a sniper hit.

738
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,719
Ah, it's definitely
not Maze's style.

739
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,594
She prefers her violence up
close and personal, believe me.

740
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,991
Guesstimating
the bullet's

741
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,635
trajectory,
I'd say the killer shot

742
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,034
from across the street.

743
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,359
Well, an entire bowling team

744
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,994
saw "that crazy hottie"

745
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,799
leave this office
right after the shooting.

746
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,150
Which means she wasn't
across the street when the shots

747
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,993
- were fired... she was here.
- Yeah.

748
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,594
She couldn't have taken
those shots.

749
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,954
But I'm still mad about the hug.

750
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,473
Well, if Maze didn't kill
the Big Lebowski here, who did?

751
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,034
Maybe somebody who framed her

752
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,276
was tying up loose ends.

753
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,596
But who has beef with Maze?

754
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,832
- My money's on someone she bounty-hunted.
- Yeah.

755
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,474
Someone she caught
and brought to justice.

756
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,319
Surely those miscreants
have the biggest grudge.

757
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,831
Well,

758
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,474
time to interview
Maze's ex-bounties.

759
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,234
Oh. Fun and games.

760
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,679
Hello.

761
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,160
Tell us how you
know Mazikeen Smith.

762
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,357
She hunted me down like a dog.

763
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,075
She came from nowhere.

764
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,471
S-So,
what did she do to you?

765
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,029
She ate my goldfish.

766
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,877
Then a rain of
many sharp knives.

767
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,190
And did she do that?

768
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,835
No, she did this.

769
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,239
Oh, dear.
Would you like some Advil?

770
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,280
What?

771
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,119
- She...
- Sorry, Detective.

772
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,557
Fish caught my tongue.

773
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,310
He tried to tell her he already
paid his parking tickets.

774
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,438
You must have been upset
that Maze caught you.

775
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,199
Mm. Perhaps you hated her.

776
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,238
Hated her enough
to frame her.

777
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,551
No. Maze is all right.

778
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,351
After she got me,
she bought me a beer.

779
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,716
She taught me
how to make a shiv

780
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,070
out of a toothbrush.

781
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,751
And you better believe
it came in handy.

782
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,229
The nice thing about Maze...

783
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,353
...she doesn't judge.

784
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,880
She's a nice lady.

785
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,390
Lucifer's always gonna
be in the way, isn't he?

786
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,593
All I know is that they
have a real connection.

787
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,990
They're a package deal now.

788
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,232
It's like...

789
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,279
Say you fall in love
with a woman who has a cat.

790
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,510
What are you gonna do?

791
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,474
You accept the cat.

792
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,956
Because she's worth it.

793
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,638
Lucifer's the cat.

794
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,558
I'd just get rid of the cat.

795
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,397
Come on.

796
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,432
We have one more.

797
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,472
Bloody hell. Let's cut
to the chase, shall we?

798
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,956
- Mm-hmm.
- Hello. Do you hold a mortal grudge

799
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,436
against bounty hunter
Mazikeen Smith?

800
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,916
Nah. I should, but no.

801
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,954
Maze changed my life.

802
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,276
She scared me straight.

803
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,436
Oh. Really?

804
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,638
What, bank job? Mob hit?

805
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,513
No. Winery gig.

806
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,990
Way overpaid.

807
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,270
Definitely fishy.

808
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,320
Maze taught me if it's too good
to be true, stay away.

809
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,354
Uh, what winery?

810
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,153
Monte De Oro Winery.

811
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,320
Gorgeous drive.

812
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,995
Very romantic.

813
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,593
Lucifer, Margo and
Zack are behind this.

814
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,631
We got to get
to that winery.

815
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,035
You really think
that they framed Maze

816
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,230
- and killed those two people?
- Yes.

817
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,669
And I bet Maze knows why.

818
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,155
- Thank you.
- Right. Looks like we'll have to stop her

819
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,431
from actually killing someone
this time. Thank you.

820
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,595
Found you.

821
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,433
Lady, you framed
the wrong demon.

822
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,756
"Sebastian Corp"?

823
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,231
Really?

824
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,079
It took me a second
after Barry mentioned it,

825
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,549
but then I remembered.

826
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:18,675
Four months ago, I tracked down
a bounty named Sebastian.

827
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,594
Yeah, real dirt bag.

828
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,600
Drove drunk,
killed a girl,

829
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,871
and then fled the charges
when his rich mommy

830
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,117
and fancy lawyers
couldn't save him.

831
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,870
Turns out that rich mommy...

832
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,240
...was you.

833
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,240
So why'd ya do it, lady?

834
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,240
Sebastian put you up to this?

835
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,236
Prison not agreeing
with Momma's little boy?

836
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,472
Sebastian is dead!

837
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,599
Killed in a prison fight,

838
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,151
the prison <i>you</i> put him in.

839
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,240
I had you framed
because I wanted you

840
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,635
to suffer like he did.

841
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,429
My boy is dead because of you.

842
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,831
You blame me?

843
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,675
Sure, why not?

844
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,674
Sebastian's a saint.

845
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,832
You're the perfect mom.

846
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,920
And I'm just the big,
bad, evil demon.

847
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,516
And what would someone
truly evil do

848
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,760
to the one who framed her?

849
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,434
Best help money can buy.

850
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:48,080
Yeah,
I've always wanted to do that.

851
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,199
Done that before.

852
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,916
Maze, no!

853
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,077
Maze,
stop!

854
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,992
Drop the knife.
This isn't you.

855
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,560
Isn't it, though?

856
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,914
I destroy things, Chloe.

857
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,356
It's what I do.

858
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,196
Friendships,

859
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,960
relationships,
apartment walls.

860
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,039
And, apparently,
I killed this lady's son.

861
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,752
Maze, I know you
didn't kill Mike Biltz,

862
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,400
and you didn't kill Barry.

863
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,711
And her son isn't
your fault, either.

864
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,030
We're all responsible
for our own choices.

865
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,276
And right now,

866
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,234
you have to make one.

867
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,956
Maze, you don't destroy
everything.

868
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,479
Trixie loves you.

869
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,433
You're the best babysitter
she has ever had.

870
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,234
Other than the time you let
that rock band spend the night,

871
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,591
and when you sent her to school
with the pot brownies.

872
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,439
But the point is,

873
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,960
no one's perfect.

874
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,480
But what matters most

875
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,433
is that you're such
a good friend...

876
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,315
to Trixie, to me.

877
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,840
And I don't know what
you're going through, Maze.

878
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,635
I wish you would talk to me,
but, please,

879
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,157
please put down the knife.

880
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,756
Let me help you.

881
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,596
Help?

882
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,990
You're the reason
he won't take me home.

883
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:18,951
What?

884
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,669
You want a knife, Chloe?

885
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,759
Maze!

886
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,839
Brother, are you sure?
I mean, the old you

887
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,679
would never have
been okay with this.

888
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,119
I don't think
we have much of a choice.

889
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,230
Charlotte.

890
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,990
Do you have a minute?

891
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,511
Sure.

892
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,633
Just getting ready to check
myself into the loony bin.

893
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,551
Charlotte, listen.
I owe you an apology.

894
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,878
I shouldn't have told you
what I did.

895
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,391
Yes. And, well, I suppose

896
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,671
that I didn't
help things either.

897
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,799
So we are here to
make things right.

898
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,759
Now, we can't undo
what we've already done,

899
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,753
but maybe we can help you
move forward.

900
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,791
Last chance to change
your mind, brother.

901
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,356
Going once,
going twice...

902
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,910
Fair enough.

903
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,351
You, um, you may want
to sit down again.

904
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,877
Nah. At this point,
things can't get any crazier.

905
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,157
You'd think.

906
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,875
Okay.

907
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,560
Oh, no, Luci.

908
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,071
We've broken her.

909
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,470
Charlotte.

910
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,990
Are you okay?

911
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,596
It's... it's real.

912
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,994
Then that means I'm...

913
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,951
I'm not crazy.

914
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,317
Hey.

915
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,591
Hey.

916
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,918
I've, uh, I've been thinking
a lot about what you said.

917
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,471
About Lucifer,
and, um...

918
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,872
You know,
I need you to know that...

919
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,151
he... he and I, we're...

920
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,355
we're good partners,

921
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,475
and... we're good friends.

922
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,951
And I... you know,
I don't want to lose that.

923
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,276
It wasn't a fair ask.

924
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,834
No. It's-it's...

925
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,838
it's also unfair of me

926
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,275
to ask you to deal
with this, you know?

927
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,909
You want to take me home?

928
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,040
I'll take you anywhere.

929
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,238
It's okay. You don't
have to ride with me.

930
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,231
I know. I want to.

931
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,474
I'm here.
What do you want?

932
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,480
To apologize.

933
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,716
Look, I thought
you were manipulating me,

934
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,912
but, well,

935
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,550
I'm a big enough devil
to admit when I'm wrong.

936
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,754
Anyway, killer caught.

937
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,554
Demon exonerated.

938
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,517
All good now?

939
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,751
No.

940
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,678
Everything that happened

941
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,678
showed me exactly why
I need to go back.

942
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,593
I don't understand.

943
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,310
It's all so

944
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,598
complicated here, Lucifer.

945
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,870
I mean, caring about humans
always goes wrong.

946
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,677
Feelings suck.

947
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,033
I am not the one who's supposed
to be tortured.

948
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,079
You're the one who does
the torturing.

949
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,270
Yes.

950
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,474
So please, just...

951
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,037
take me home.

952
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,275
I can't. And not

953
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,870
just 'cause of possible
repercussions with Dad.

954
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,834
I...

955
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,315
I can't lose you,

956
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,995
Maze.

957
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,194
Not you, too.

958
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,751
Oh.

959
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,917
What do you mean,
"not me, too"?

960
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,392
The detective.

961
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,079
- Right.
- I just saw her

962
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,316
ride off with Pierce.

963
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,671
She looked so happy.

964
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,560
That's what I want, I suppose,
isn't it, her happiness?

965
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,919
I just wish I knew that
Pierce's intentions were pure.

966
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,512
Anyway, point is, you're right.

967
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,832
Feelings and humans suck.

968
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,310
So...

969
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,958
at least we have each other.

970
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,994
I'm always gonna be
the consolation prize for you.

971
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,153
You only care about me

972
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,560
when you don't have Chloe.

973
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,157
- Maze, now hold on. That's..
- No.

974
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,152
No one puts me first.

975
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,509
Least of all you.

976
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,154
None of you deserve me.

977
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,115
Leaving town?

978
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,274
What are you doing here?

979
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,197
You're angry the people
you trust let you down.

980
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,750
Hmm.

981
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,079
Which is why we should work
together for a change.

982
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,513
Why would I do that?

983
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,195
I don't even like you.

984
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,190
I don't like you either.

985
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,395
But at least I won't pretend
to be your friend,

986
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,676
like everyone else does.

987
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,956
Like I said, why would
I do anything for you?

988
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,874
Because...

989
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,197
I can help us both get
what we want.
