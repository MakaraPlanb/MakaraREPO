1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,709
<i>- Previously on</i> Lucifer...
- You are my brother

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,752
and my test.
So what's the plan?

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:06,598
We need to make

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,597
<i>the detective realize</i>

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,790
<i>that Pierce isn't the man</i>

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,751
<i>she thinks he is.</i>

7
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,235
If we don't get Chloe
to love you,

8
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,476
then I can't kill you,

9
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,479
and I need this
to get back to Hell.

10
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,750
I like you, Charlotte.

11
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,280
So, if you need
time, I can wait.

12
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,197
You're worth it.

13
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,473
What do you desire?

14
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,070
- I want her to choose me.
- Then tell her.

15
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,919
Chloe Decker,
will you marry me?

16
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,758
Yes.

17
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,953
Are you listening?

18
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,635
Get a move on.

19
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:34,757
What part of

20
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,397
"she can't perform without it"
do you not understand?

21
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,393
Great. Just great.

22
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,357
This is the agility trials
in San Fran all over again.

23
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,357
Run.

24
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,352
Run!

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,434
This is an heirloom.

26
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,910
Only the best for Bootsie.

27
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,915
And now, introducing
last year's grand prize winner,

28
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,636
Bootsie.

29
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,197
Situation sorted.

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,436
You wish.

31
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,917
Cornelia's up next and
no one's laid eyes on her.

32
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,795
Ms. Cornelia, showtime.

33
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,831
Ms. Cornelia?

34
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,351
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

35
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,477
Wowzers.

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,956
That is some rock,
girlfriend.

37
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,554
It is exciting, isn't it?

38
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,830
Um, yeah, I mean,

39
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,639
heart melting,
brain exploding.

40
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,637
Wait, clock's ticking.

41
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,160
How much time do we have
before the big day?

42
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,589
- Three...
- Months?

43
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,870
...weeks, actually.

44
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,514
What? That is not
enough time to plan.

45
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,234
Well, Marcus and I
thought why wait?

46
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,476
When you know,
you know, right?

47
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,670
I'm not talking
about the wedding.

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,879
No, I am talking about
the bachelorette party.

49
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,877
Well, it's the
second wedding.

50
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,752
Do I need one?

51
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,030
Uh, yeah, you do.

52
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,357
It sets the foundation
for your whole support system.

53
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,592
And trust me,
you're gonna need one

54
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,632
for the dark days
to come 'cause, I mean,

55
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,840
sleeping with the same dude

56
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,679
for the rest of your life?

57
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,434
Even hot gets boring, Chloe.

58
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,233
Dark days ahead, indeed.

59
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,476
I may have to take my chances.

60
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,636
Uh, Decker.

61
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,837
All of my life,
I have been dreaming

62
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,594
of the chance to plan
a bachelorette party.

63
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,593
But four brothers.
Remember?

64
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,759
And you're the closest thing
I have to a sister right now.

65
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,355
Well...

66
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,710
I guess if you're gonna
play the sister card.

67
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,110
Yes!

68
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,159
Oh, wait.
Let's talk theme.

69
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,319
The bachelorette
and wedding should match.

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,791
You know, color palette, dress,
cake, venue, flowers...

71
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,151
Playlist, DJ, tuxedo,

72
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,396
- marriage license.
- Right.

73
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,960
We have the nice bottle

74
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,310
of single malt for the bar,

75
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,789
which is gonna be open,

76
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,196
which means we need to
get a couple bartenders.

77
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,431
This is a lot, isn't it?

78
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,600
It's, uh...

79
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,038
Do you think we should maybe
postpone the date?

80
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,236
Is that what you want?

81
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,197
No. No.

82
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,834
Totally and completely no.

83
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,350
I... unless...

84
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,833
- unless you do.
- Absolutely not.

85
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,152
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

86
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,559
I mean, look, we solve murders.

87
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,792
- How hard can it be to plan one little wedding?
- Yeah.

88
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,470
But I think I know what'll help.

89
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,598
- Hmm?
- I recently discovered that a certain detective

90
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,877
has weeks
of unused vacation days.

91
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,039
Couple days away from the office
might give you time to plan.

92
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,633
Chloe said yes?

93
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,992
- To marry Pierce?
- It's mind-boggling,

94
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,350
I know.

95
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,710
I mean,
when I said I was at peace

96
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,798
with the detective
making her own choices,

97
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,116
it didn't occur to me

98
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,398
that she'd be capable of making
such a spectacularly bad one.

99
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,670
I mean,

100
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:46,997
why on earth?

101
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,674
Why is besides
the point, Luci.

102
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,030
We can't allow this to happen.

103
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,509
Oh, I like this new you.

104
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,871
I wish you'd realized
I was your test eons ago.

105
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,594
Luci, it is God's will that you

106
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,876
- and Chloe...
- Yeah, don't ruin it.

107
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,197
I'm just happy

108
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,357
that we're on the same side
for once.

109
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,270
So, what's the plan?

110
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,314
The plan... is simple.

111
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,715
The plan is simple.

112
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,354
I'm going to try
to understand why

113
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,950
the detective
would want to marry

114
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,230
that overstuffed man ham

115
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,800
and then make her see
she's deranged.

116
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,560
Or you could just tell her
how you feel.

117
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,633
I already missed my window
for that, unfortunately.

118
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,118
He's weaseled his way
into her heart,

119
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,960
and I don't understand how,

120
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,350
but I need to.

121
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,436
Well, good luck.

122
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,711
And I will come up with a plan
that will actually work.

123
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,831
Of course you will.

124
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,556
Ah, Detective.

125
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,194
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

126
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,835
Uh, anyway, since
changes are afoot,

127
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,674
I'd like to address
things head-on.

128
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,915
Oh. Well,
that's oddly mature of you.

129
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,918
And it's... it's nice to know

130
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,520
that you're not gonna start
acting all weird.

131
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,710
Oh, what's this?
Is this an engagement gift?

132
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,071
It's much better than that.
It's a personality test.

133
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,112
So I can understand why
you do the things you do

134
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,591
and, uh, decide
the things you decide.

135
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,790
A personality test?

136
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,270
So much for not acting weird.

137
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,915
What? You know, to help
optimize our partnership.

138
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,196
Okay, well,
it's gonna have to wait,

139
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,756
because I am taking some
time off to plan the wedding.

140
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,119
I... Well, how am I supposed
to get inside your head

141
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,595
if I can't watch you at work?

142
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,996
The job is who you are,
Detective.

143
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,951
Well, how about

144
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,991
you watch Dan.

145
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,271
Because my cases
have been reassigned,

146
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,278
and I'm sure
he'd appreciate the help.

147
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,154
Well, looks like it's
you and me, Lucinda.

148
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,796
Yippee.

149
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,631
- And then there's potential reason number 54...
- 55.

150
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,231
...55 the detective would accept
Pierce's proposal: drugs.

151
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,352
EUI... Engaged
Under the Influence.

152
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,755
Or craziest reason yet:

153
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,952
maybe Chloe said yes
because it's what she wants.

154
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,475
Well, maybe it's what
she thinks she wants,

155
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,160
but does she know
what she truly desires?

156
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,953
'Cause few do
unless I help them.

157
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,391
And unfortunately,
I can't do that with her.

158
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,440
Not peony, <i>penis.</i>

159
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,318
Peni... Yeah, sure, I'll hold.

160
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,479
Vic is Francis Hoffman.
Time of death roughly 9:00 a.m.

161
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,951
- Husband's on his way now.
- Right.

162
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,712
Well, aren't you gonna ask

163
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,990
about these suspicious
paw prints?

164
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,077
The detective
certainly would.

165
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,232
The prints belong

166
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,391
to Cornelia,

167
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,357
the vic's prizewinning Mastiff.

168
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,556
Currently AWOL, though.

169
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,513
Ah, right. A canine killer.

170
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,519
- Seems they can't trust you with a real homicide, Daniel.
- Nope.

171
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,995
The bitch is innocent.

172
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,193
Cause of death
was blunt force trauma,

173
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,834
so the killer is human.

174
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,310
You can rush the order?

175
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,391
Awesome!

176
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,831
Okay.

177
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,831
It's all in here.

178
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,036
- Oh.
- I got me

179
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,720
a penis piñata to pick up.

180
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,870
Right,
well, by now, the detective

181
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,390
- would have formulated a working theory, so...
- Listen, dude.

182
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,070
I know you're
going through stuff

183
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,873
with this whole
Chloe-getting-engaged thing,

184
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,198
but I can't have you
second-guessing my every move.

185
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,312
Chloe has her reasons for making
the decisions that she makes,

186
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,237
and I have mine.

187
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,035
Only one of us can be detective.

188
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,515
- You're right.
- Yeah.

189
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,033
That is the perfect way to
understand the detective.

190
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,791
I'm gonna take the
lead and be her.

191
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,238
Right.

192
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,675
That is not what I meant.

193
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,959
Francis loved the beach.

194
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,516
We just celebrated our sixth
wedding anniversary in Malibu.

195
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,837
Two daddies and one fur baby.

196
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,276
Has there been any sign of her?

197
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,355
Cornelia's all I have left.

198
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,678
Not yet, but my job
means everything to me.

199
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,917
Solving murders is
my one true passion,

200
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,397
and as such, I promise you
that I will find Cornelia

201
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,916
and get justice
for your slaughtered husband...

202
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,352
because I am empathetic.

203
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,397
I care.

204
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,717
Yeah.

205
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,711
Will you excuse us for
just a second, please?

206
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,436
Thought you never lied.

207
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,279
What? I do care...

208
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,240
about channeling
the detective

209
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,715
so I can find out why she does
the things she does

210
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,394
- and makes the decisions she makes.
- Okay, look.

211
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,398
Whatever it is,
we still have to do our job.

212
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,432
You know, like asking questions
relating to the crime.

213
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,393
Okay? Just let me handle this.

214
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,440
Uh, Frederick?

215
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,711
Do you know of anyone who
had a beef with Francis?

216
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,910
Anyone who would want
to hurt him?

217
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,156
Oh, right, that is exactly

218
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,191
the sort of futile question

219
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,390
the detective would ask.

220
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,950
- Do you?
- I mean,

221
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,594
everyone loved Francis.

222
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,760
But he did get into an argument
with someone in the parking lot

223
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,599
of the training center
last week.

224
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,553
- Did you get a name?
- No, I...

225
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,194
I thought they were just arguing
about a parking spot.

226
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,479
But I did take down
the license plate

227
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,673
in case he came back
to key the car...

228
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,591
if that's helpful?

229
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,756
Is that helpful?

230
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:38,992
Yeah.

231
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,230
Right. Thank you.

232
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,754
I got your message
about the engagement.

233
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,078
- Plan's back on, right?
- Whoa, easy, there.

234
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,919
Oh, relax.
I'm not gonna do it here.

235
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,636
I mean, I remember the plan.

236
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,997
Kill you, frame Lucifer,
blah, blah, blah.

237
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,719
I'm just really excited.

238
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,752
Well, that's not
why I called you.

239
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,314
I called to apologize.

240
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,920
Apologize about what?

241
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,236
I don't want to die anymore.

242
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,512
I'm in love with Chloe.
I want to be with her.

243
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,514
I-I know you
don't understand.

244
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,995
I hardly do, myself.

245
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,795
You know, I've never
felt like this before.

246
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,037
- We had a deal!
- And I will honor it.

247
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,511
I promise to find you
another way back to Hell.

248
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,557
Show me your arm.

249
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,877
Really?

250
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,790
I don't get it.

251
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,436
If Decker loves you,

252
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,710
then the mark should be gone.

253
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,551
Unless she's having
second thoughts about you.

254
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,917
Well, that's not...

255
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,837
Oh, my God.

256
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,793
Maze, super psyched you're here.

257
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,153
I got me
what you might call

258
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,000
an "all hands on Decker"
emergency.

259
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,074
- Would you...?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

260
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,430
- Conference room.
- Yeah.

261
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,275
I'll work on Chloe
and get her back on board.

262
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,796
In the meantime,

263
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,196
you better figure out
that other way...

264
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,956
fast.

265
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,237
<i>Is that</i>

266
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,999
a wedding murder board?

267
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,351
I am just trying to
stay organized here.

268
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,880
Wow. Mug shot for the caterer.

269
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,190
Nice work, Decker.

270
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,629
- You see what I'm dealing with?
- Mm-hmm.

271
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,230
Guys, solving crimes
makes sense to me.

272
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,994
Wedding stuff, not so much.

273
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,680
Why do you think Dan and I
got married at the courthouse

274
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,910
and then went right back
to work?

275
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,759
Decker, trust me,

276
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,316
we will help you deal
with all the wedding details

277
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,472
Blind drunk

278
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,676
at your bachelorette party.

279
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,714
- Mm-hmm.
- Which needs to be awesome.

280
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,637
That's where you come in

281
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,320
while I deal with a
new lead in this case.

282
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,591
Oh, the case. Right.

283
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,031
- What's going on with that?
- I-I ran a partial license

284
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,071
and got a match.

285
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,277
Security footage
shows the suspect's car

286
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,550
at the location of the murder.

287
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,876
Okay, who is it registered to?

288
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,070
You will never know that

289
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,437
because you are
on wedding vacay.

290
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,915
All right.
My dress.

291
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,674
- I need to get a dress.
- Yep. Mm-hmm.

292
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,916
And while you do that...

293
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,751
We will...

294
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,834
seal this wedding dealio

295
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,117
by throwing you
a bachelorette party

296
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,356
you won't forget.

297
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,672
Thanks.

298
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,910
I think.

299
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,712
Perfect. Okay, so you plan the
pregame till I get off of work.

300
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,797
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, my God.

301
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,036
With you on the case,

302
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,277
this night is gonna be insane!

303
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,879
Yes, we're heading
there right now.

304
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,673
Actually, we would've been there
20 minutes ago

305
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,633
if someone didn't have to stop
for a wardrobe change.

306
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,274
I'm committed, Daniel.

307
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,836
Okay, so, uh, Ella tracked
the plate of the guy

308
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,874
Francis fought with to an ex-con
named Vincent Walker.

309
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,074
Car was spotted on 3rd and Main.
So we should, you know, hurry.

310
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,509
Well, I'm going as fast
as I can.

311
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,598
You're going 34 in a 35, man.

312
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,276
I can't risk accidentally
going over the speed limit.

313
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,436
The detective wouldn't.

314
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,953
Why don't you just ask Chloe
why she said yes to Pierce?

315
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,319
Oh, there's no point bothering
the detective on her time off.

316
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,989
But speaking of
baffling unions,

317
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,510
how are you doing? You and
Charlotte still a thing?

318
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,312
Oh, I...

319
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,519
Yeah, she's kind of going
through some stuff right now.

320
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,518
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- And I'm just...

321
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,080
- you know, I'm giving her space.
- Right.

322
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,276
- Or I'm trying to.
- Hmm.

323
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,916
But thank you for caring, man.

324
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,556
Oh, no, I don't care.

325
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,631
Oh, right, right, but Chloe would.

326
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,593
Now you're
getting it, Daniel.

327
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,075
Just drive, man.

328
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,995
Hey, Amenadiel.

329
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,793
- This a bad time?
- I could use a break

330
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,469
from prosecuting the
Malibu State water polo team.

331
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,870
Well, I was hoping
that you might be able

332
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,036
to help me out again.

333
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,436
I know we failed to prove

334
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,670
Pierce is The Sinnerman,

335
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,439
but I've still been digging,

336
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,911
and I am confident
that eventually...

337
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,351
Actually, I'm taking a different
angle this time, Charlotte.

338
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,399
I need to split up
the engagement

339
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,875
between him and Chloe.

340
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,710
Any chance to get in
His good graces, I'm in.

341
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,192
The thing is, Pierce seems
to genuinely be in love.

342
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,637
To stop this, we would
have to understand him,

343
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,356
and that... that guy
is impenetrable.

344
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,029
Well, if being a trial lawyer
has taught me anything,

345
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,039
it's that there's always a way
to get inside someone's head,

346
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,233
get them to have
a change of heart.

347
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,351
Go on.

348
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,394
You're both former immortals
that became mortal.

349
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,918
You could dig into your
own fears and insecurities,

350
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,311
weaponize them.

351
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,592
Not the easiest,
I know.

352
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,234
But worthy of a test.

353
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,357
Hmm.

354
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,431
Well, while I'm doing that,
perhaps you can work on Chloe?

355
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,037
Guess who just got invited
to Chloe's bachelorette party,

356
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,197
co-hosted by Maze,
of all people.

357
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,951
Bring singles.

358
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,350
Exactly.

359
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,560
Chloe will be drunk
in some stripper's arms

360
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,639
questioning her life choices
in no time.

361
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,114
All I have to do
is water the seeds of doubt.

362
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,238
Okay, so,
Vince Walker's record's

363
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,999
chock full of
violence, man.

364
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,271
Worked as a leg breaker
for the mob.

365
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,477
- You gonna pay attention or what?
- Hmm?

366
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,793
Oh, yes, whoever
wanted Francis dead

367
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,878
probably hired this
Vincent chap to kill him.

368
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,150
And I'd say,

369
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,794
based on the security
around that doorway

370
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,480
over there,
and the fact I've been here

371
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,354
many times before,
that is an illegal gambling den.

372
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,835
As such,
it's a reasonable assumption

373
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,440
that our devious
murderer's in there.

374
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,471
Nice work.
You actually have

375
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,831
this whole Chloe thing down pat.

376
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,077
And yet I'm still no closer
to understanding her.

377
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,674
I mean, I'm following
all the rules,

378
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,837
I'm actually paying
attention to the leads,

379
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,912
I'm covering all
the bases like she does.

380
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,157
It gives me
no time to do

381
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,317
the foolish,
impulsive things I normally do

382
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,636
that help solve
a crime.

383
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,830
Oh, hold on.

384
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,915
That's it. That's what's
missing: I need a "me."

385
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,117
- A "you"?
- Yes.

386
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,800
Well, to truly go
full Detective,

387
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,311
I require a partner who's
clever and unpredictable,

388
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,398
handsome, sexual.

389
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,352
Suppose one out of four
will suffice. Well done, Daniel.

390
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,197
Wow.

391
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,796
Which one of
the four am I?

392
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,480
Come on.

393
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,312
Yo, Lucifer.

394
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,118
Hey.

395
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,397
Thank you.

396
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,915
All right, remember,
just be me, Daniel.

397
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,756
Uh...

398
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,557
Hey, everybody.

399
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,950
Who the hell are you?

400
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,994
I'll show you who I am.

401
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,355
Oh, what the heck
happened to my, uh...

402
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,676
- Uh...
- What are you looking for, buddy?

403
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,878
Trouble?
A few lost teeth?

404
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,436
How'd you even get in here?

405
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,275
Right. Just be Lucifer.

406
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,399
I'm here for your money...
and your women.

407
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,590
Teeth it is.

408
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,876
Ah.

409
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,714
You buried the lede.

410
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,277
Maze, this is really sweet.

411
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,950
You helping me with all this
traditional bride stuff,

412
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,478
and-and for me, it's gonna be
really nice hanging out again.

413
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,275
Nice is exactly what
I was going for.

414
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,678
Yeah. Yeah, right.
Wait, where are we going?

415
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,712
There better
not be male strippers.

416
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,072
You underestimate
me, Decker.

417
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,874
- Careful. All right.
- Okay, okay.

418
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,958
- You ready?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm ready.

419
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,792
Oh.

420
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,395
Wow. Hi.

421
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,234
Yes, I-I definitely never
would have guessed this.

422
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,960
Surprise!

423
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,716
It certainly
was for me.

424
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,158
Care for some
non-alcoholic punch?

425
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,070
Come on.

426
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,192
Sorry, not sorry.

427
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,436
Loser.

428
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:09,718
You know what?

429
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,553
Maybe this chair'll be luckier.

430
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,873
So, hit man's greatest hits.

431
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,590
What's the latest, Vince?

432
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,755
I don't know who you are, but
that stuff was a long time ago.

433
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,838
A man of your
reputation and skill?

434
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,316
I can't imagine you'd retire.

435
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,517
New time, new tune.
Not what I want anymore.

436
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,599
So then, uh, tell me,

437
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,472
what do you want or,
uh, desire?

438
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,716
I'm married, pal.

439
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,754
Oh.

440
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,917
No, no, I mean, uh...

441
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,756
Like, what do you <i>want</i> want?
Not, like, me, like...

442
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,390
in life, what do you want?

443
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,996
I want to play.
Are you in or you out?

444
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,391
Yeah.

445
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,470
Is that a dog bite?

446
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,960
Oh, don't tell me,
scars turn you on?

447
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,550
No, man.

448
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,910
It's just that when
I was a kid, I got bit.

449
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,915
She was a rescue,
Chihuahua.

450
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,839
She had been abused,
but, uh, we kept her.

451
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,476
Pebbles... turned into
a real friend, you know.

452
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,595
- Well, this was no Chihuahua.
- What kind of dog was it?

453
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,554
Well... huh?

454
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,277
Go, go, go!

455
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,357
LAPD!

456
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,311
Hands in the air!

457
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,000
I don't want any heroes!

458
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,316
Hands up!

459
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,153
Lucifer. Come here!

460
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,359
What the hell, man? SWAT?

461
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,836
Yes, well, this is when
I normally get into a spot

462
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,872
of danger,
so I called in for backup

463
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,309
like a responsible
detective would.

464
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,034
The suspect was
just about to give me

465
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,310
incriminating
evidence, man.

466
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,397
Daniel, would you quit
making this about yourself.

467
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,398
- Looking for booze?
- Yeah.

468
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,513
And Maze's bong,
and decent music,

469
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,519
and a strapping naked dude
with student loans and a dream.

470
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,040
Not on Maze's itinerary.

471
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,674
- Maze has an itinerary?
- Yep.

472
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,275
And I stole it.

473
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,877
Nail art,

474
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,911
Mahjong,

475
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,713
silent meditation?

476
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,631
Did you guys find the booze?

477
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,714
Exactly. We should be
nipple-deep in Jager by now

478
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,559
and playing pin the tail
on Ryan Gosling.

479
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,476
I can't believe that Maze legit
hijacked my bachelorette party.

480
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,916
- You mean Chloe's bachelorette party.
- That's what I said.

481
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,909
This is odd. What is Maze up to?

482
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,756
Okay. All the things
that you love about Pierce. Go.

483
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,317
Oh. He does this really
adorable, like, scrape-y thing

484
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,715
- when he burns the toast...
- Aw.

485
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,673
- And do-do I really have to do a hundred of these?
- Yes.

486
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,430
Oh, man.
I promised Chloe the moon.

487
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,791
And I gave her burnt toast.

488
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,640
Please. We've got
to do something.

489
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,717
Yeah.

490
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,360
I've got an idea.

491
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,834
I'm not gonna
bite you, Pierce.

492
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,271
Says the guy who's tried
to kill me numerous times...

493
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,756
and now can succeed.

494
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,631
Relax. I asked you here
to celebrate.

495
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,557
So you're not mad
that I got rid of my mark?

496
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,230
I feel this odd
kinship, actually.

497
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,711
I mean, this is like the, uh,
the first official meeting

498
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,594
of the Immortals
Turned Mortal Club.

499
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,520
In that case,
the beer's on you.

500
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,549
It's all my Father's plan,
I have to assume.

501
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,511
Maybe.

502
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,074
But for now, I need
to keep it quiet

503
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,270
from certain people,

504
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,636
until I know it's gonna stick.

505
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,078
cone of <i>silencio.</i>

506
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,273
I've wanted this
to happen for so long.

507
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,914
It's hard to believe
it actually is.

508
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,918
Hey, I'm really happy for you,
Pierce. Truly.

509
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,156
- Thanks, bro.
- I mean,

510
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,432
becoming mortal is the best
thing that ever happened to me.

511
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,719
Everything is so much better
when you know that you can...

512
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,390
you can die
at any moment.

513
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,836
How much time do we
have left? 30-odd years?

514
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,918
40, if we lay off the sauce?

515
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,236
I mean, that's a
drop in the bucket

516
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,994
for a former immortal.

517
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,590
Hadn't thought of it that way.

518
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,032
Every sip of beer,
every blue sky,

519
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,634
every motorcycle ride,

520
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,158
every kiss...

521
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,159
So much more precious

522
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,317
when you realize it
could be your last.

523
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,752
That any random act
could just...

524
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,598
take it all away.

525
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,840
Uh.

526
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,311
Oh, come on.

527
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,992
Definitely strapless. Mmm.

528
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,430
And with a bow.

529
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,712
Yes. Yes.
A big one.

530
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,315
Okay, I'm gonna get
another roll.

531
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,991
I did this two-ply

532
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,997
wedding dress garbage

533
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,714
at my cousin Rita's
bachelorette party.

534
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,876
You know what happened?

535
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,674
Not drunken pole dancing.

536
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,473
You know what else
isn't happening?

537
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,239
Us. Here.

538
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,193
This is torture.

539
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,629
Of course, Maze.

540
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,677
This all makes sense.

541
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,080
Oh, my gosh,
what could that be?

542
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,000
It's probably just, uh, Trixie
and her stupid little friend

543
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,236
next door.

544
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,351
Hold on.

545
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,277
Chloe.

546
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,758
- Is that...?
- You see it?

547
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,678
Oh, my God.

548
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,520
Okay, now, this is what I'm
talking about right here.

549
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,912
You didn't really think
we'd stay home, did you?

550
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,351
- You guys, you shouldn't have.
- Honk, honk.

551
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,516
Honk for "Fun! Fun! Fun!"

552
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,475
No, they really shouldn't have.

553
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,359
The detective always goes first.

554
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,079
So, Vince.

555
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,877
you were hired

556
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,959
to take out Francis so Cornelia
couldn't compete in the show.

557
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,515
Or was the
dog the target,

558
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,195
and she attacked,
so you killed the owner instead?

559
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,431
Hmm?

560
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,750
This is where I'd
make a clever pun

561
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,711
about the underdog.

562
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,990
Look,
I wasn't hired to take out

563
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,520
the competition,
I am the competition.

564
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,517
What do you mean?

565
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,756
I got into dog training through

566
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,838
the "pups and parolees" program
in jail.

567
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,550
That's how I got this bite.

568
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,309
I fell in love
with one.

569
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,717
Elliot.

570
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,713
I found out later
he was a purebred Mastiff,

571
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,832
so I started taking him
to all the shows.

572
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,110
He loves the shows.

573
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,470
You're not in
the competition database.

574
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,319
Daniel, that's my line.

575
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,438
You're not in
the competition database.

576
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,438
If those snobs
ever saw me with my Elly,

577
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,790
they'd never give him
a fair shake.

578
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,430
- So I pay someone to pretend to be his owner.
- Then why were you

579
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,836
- fighting with Francis?
- Look, I don't want to talk about it, all right?

580
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,474
Daniel, time to slam the suspect

581
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,040
up against the wall
to elicit a response.

582
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,878
Wait...

583
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,196
Oh, come on, practice with me.

584
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,151
Look, look, look.

585
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,397
The fight with Francis
was over puppy custody.

586
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,875
Cornelia was pregnant.

587
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,270
With my Elly's babies.

588
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,749
I could never murder
the puppies'

589
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,189
maternal grandfather.

590
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,874
I'm not some monster.

591
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,759
A litter of purebred
Mastiff puppies

592
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,474
is worth tens of thousands
of dollars.

593
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,357
O-Oh, right.

594
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,994
Who else knew about the puppies?

595
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,269
<i>Oh, The Big Easy!</i>

596
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,673
<i>Put them on, put them on.</i>

597
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,315
Okay, okay. Look.
"L'il Miss Can't Behave."

598
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,232
Oh, my gosh.

599
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,517
- Oh!
- Gosh. - Oh, my gosh.

600
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,040
- Oh! Oh!
- Maze.

601
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,391
Oh, don't worry, Decker, there's
lots more where that came from.

602
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,511
- Really?
- There really is.

603
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,393
Did you see that bar?

604
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,557
Is it cool?

605
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,596
What the hell is this?

606
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,271
Uh, the best
bachelorette party ever.

607
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,279
Hells yeah. This bus really
amped things up a notch!

608
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,676
Yeah, and now I need you
to de-notch.

609
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,554
Are you nuts? This is
everything I ever dreamed of.

610
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,952
In genuine pleather.

611
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,471
Ella, I really need this wedding
to happen.

612
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,839
That means no surprises,
no problems,

613
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,600
and definitely no drunken
change of heart.

614
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,871
We all know
Decker can't handle her booze.

615
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,590
I don't know. She seems to
be handling it just fine.

616
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,076
Yeah!
Looks like marrying

617
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,796
ol' reliable is letting her
bust out her inner Lucifer.

618
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,835
Yeah? And we all know
he isn't the marrying kind.

619
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,271
Come on, Maze,
it's one night.

620
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,073
Just let her
have some fun.

621
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,800
What could
possibly go wrong?

622
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,396
No!

623
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,594
Charlotte,
what is happening?

624
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,793
I agreed to waive the charges

625
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,434
on the Malibu State
water polo team

626
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,519
if they agreed to wave
some other things.

627
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,800
- Amazing.
- Right?

628
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,071
Yeah!

629
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,271
The Barkley.
Owned by Dr. Valerie Haynes,

630
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,836
veterinarian to the stars
and the SoCal Dog Show.

631
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,952
Apparently, every canine
contestant is required

632
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,917
to be examined
by Dr. Valerie

633
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,157
- before they can actually compete, which means...
- Mm.

634
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,238
...she definitely would have
known Cornelia was pregnant.

635
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,990
And she would have been
at the crime scene.

636
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,634
No, I still don't think
this is working.

637
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,671
Agree.

638
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,718
- And I think it's my fault.
- Also agree.

639
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,111
See, the problem is, we rarely
work this closely together,

640
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,630
you and I. And you can't
be expected to just know

641
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,111
the delicate
detective-consultant chemistry.

642
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,357
So I think you clearly need

643
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,836
an intensive hands-on
tutelage on how to be me.

644
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,157
That, I don't agree with.

645
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,317
Excellent.

646
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,232
Uh, you might want
to take some notes.

647
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,789
- Oh, yeah.
- Hello there.

648
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,593
Uh, we would love
to see Dr. Valerie,

649
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,633
if possible.

650
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,516
<i>I can assure you</i>

651
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,359
I know nothing about any murder.

652
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,912
Over puppies? I mean,
who would do such a thing?

653
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,959
Well, the rent in this
part of town is pretty hefty.

654
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,560
And those puppies
were extremely valuable,

655
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,910
especially
on the black market.

656
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,833
Oh.

657
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,039
You think I need money?

658
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,995
Imagine how much people spend
on their kids.

659
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,630
Peanuts compared to what
they spend on their pets.

660
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,597
Trust me,

661
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,513
I have more
than I could ever want.

662
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,471
Oh.

663
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,557
Do you, now?

664
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,997
Watch and learn.

665
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,679
Surely, there must be something
that you desire.

666
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,637
I...

667
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,876
Mm.

668
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,117
I'm...

669
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,436
Mm-hmm.

670
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,549
I'm really all good.

671
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,671
Come now,

672
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,436
there's really nothing you want
deep, deep down?

673
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,640
I want the
miracle of birth.

674
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,230
Trying to solve a murder here,
love, but I'm sure

675
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,840
you can find someone
to help you with that.

676
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,150
Eventually.

677
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,470
You don't mean...

678
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,760
for you, do you?

679
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,074
Of course I took the dog
when I had the chance.

680
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,080
Do you know how
little I get paid?

681
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,600
All the missed holidays?

682
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,031
Dr. Valerie spends most
of her time in Hawaii.

683
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,270
So I took Cornelia

684
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,590
and I hid her here.

685
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,439
And when Francis tried
to stop you,

686
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,756
you, what, killed him?

687
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,156
No! I <i>was</i> backstage,

688
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,396
but he was already dead.

689
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,030
Cornelia was frantic.

690
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,031
She came to me.

691
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,475
She's very particular,

692
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,040
and she knew
that I would take care of her.

693
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,720
By selling her precious babies?

694
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,553
I know it was wrong,

695
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,356
but I was gonna return her
right after she gave birth.

696
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,519
Look, I'm not a killer. I swear.

697
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,598
They never are,
are they?

698
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,640
Well, given motive
and lack of alibi,

699
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,314
you leave me with no choice
but to follow

700
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,318
my trusty detective gut
and arrest you

701
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,113
for the murder
of Francis Hoffman.

702
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,391
Tag her and bag her.

703
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,270
Well, suspect
apprehended.

704
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,351
Canine found.

705
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,876
And that is how
it's done, Daniel.

706
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,550
Oh, my gosh.

707
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,911
That's definitely one way
to sober up.

708
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,113
Charlotte. Oh,
Charlotte, hi.

709
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,316
Gettin' your groove on?

710
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,199
My groove is
on pause lately.

711
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,240
But forget about me.

712
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,597
This night is all you.

713
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,274
I got to say,
it's nice forgetting

714
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,119
about the wedding
stress for once.

715
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,071
Why stress?

716
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,955
It's all exciting!

717
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,159
And so bold.

718
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,352
First Dan, now Pierce?

719
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,398
Marrying a second guy
from your office?

720
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,791
But screw the professional
optics, right?

721
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,751
You have a type.

722
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,633
When you know, you know.

723
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,956
Whoa!
What are you doing? Whoa!

724
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,233
Um,
is it just me

725
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,235
or are we short a couple
of giant hot dudes?

726
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,279
Maze! What are you doing?

727
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,277
Hey!

728
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,834
I liked that guy!

729
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,753
He smelled
like chlorine

730
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,560
and butterscotch fudge.

731
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,154
I am five-feet-nothing
of coiled live wire, Maze.

732
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,114
This... means... war!

733
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,630
Linda, Linda,
Linda, Linda, please!

734
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,315
Maybe we can circle back
and-and then pick him up again.

735
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,874
While we're on the topic,

736
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,716
I would love
some relationship advice.

737
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,435
From me? Well, I'm not
an expert. Clearly.

738
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,790
I don't know.

739
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,151
I mean, your faith in some

740
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,478
pretty ruinous odds
is truly inspiring.

741
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,477
Did you know

742
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,319
that L.A. has one
of the highest divorce rates

743
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,716
- in all of the U.S.?
- Does it?

744
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,990
- Yeah.
- Really?

745
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,675
My plan has nothing to do
with you.

746
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,200
It is for Chloe.

747
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,835
I want to get her
exactly what she wants.

748
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:14,797
Pierce.

749
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,474
Married. To her.

750
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,670
No drama.

751
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,640
Yeah. <i>Totally</i> agree!

752
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,236
Total lack of drama

753
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,874
starting right now!

754
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,072
Cupid Maze? Altruism?

755
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,873
Pearls? No way.

756
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,400
People get married now
multiple times.

757
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,630
You're up
to something!

758
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,956
- I mean...
- Tell me!

759
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,640
I suppose there's
nothing stopping you

760
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,796
from getting married again

761
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,990
- after Pierce.
- Charlotte,

762
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,551
I know you're not trying
to freak Chloe out,

763
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,836
but it kind of seems

764
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,270
like you're getting
in her head.

765
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,234
- You really think so?
- Wait,

766
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,951
are you trying
to freak her out on purpose?

767
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,832
Uh...

768
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,918
Let's go.

769
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,758
Bring it.

770
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,879
Stop the freaking bus!

771
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,278
Everyone but Chloe out!

772
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,596
Now!

773
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,471
You know,

774
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,439
we could've sent the dog back
with the rest of the guys.

775
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,320
Nonsense. The detective would
never allow a pregnant lady

776
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,756
to ride in the back
of a filthy police van.

777
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,189
How very sensitive of her.

778
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,033
Yes. And so predictable.

779
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,551
I mean, how can the detective's
actions be so easy to replicate

780
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,593
and yet so hard to decipher?

781
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,280
I still have absolutely no clue

782
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,557
as to why she said yes
to Pierce.

783
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,835
Not to point
fingers, Daniel,

784
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,834
but I do wish you'd tried
harder to be, well, me.

785
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,153
If you weren't so afraid
all the bloody time...

786
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,395
I am not afraid.

787
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,160
Oh. Oh, really?

788
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,352
You say you're giving Charlotte
time and space

789
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,040
because it's what she wants,

790
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,232
but we both know
you're using it as an excuse

791
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,392
- to avoid telling her wha <i>t you</i> want.
- Fine.

792
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,920
Okay. Yeah. Maybe...

793
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,237
maybe I'm not great
at admitting what I want.

794
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,193
And maybe it wouldn't
kill me to...

795
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,869
- Lucifer it up every now and then.
- Mm.

796
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,594
But when it comes
to understanding people,

797
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,634
I'm not taking any pointers from you, man.

798
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,594
In fact, I think
you're the one who's afraid.

799
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,111
Excuse me?

800
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,716
The reason you won't ask Chloe
why she's marrying Pierce

801
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,400
is because you're scared
to hear the answer.

802
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,910
- That's absurd.
- No.

803
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,994
That's why you're playing all
these stupid little head games.

804
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,754
Which aren't gonna work,
by the way.

805
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,234
Because, first off,

806
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,435
you're only thinking about Chloe
as her job.

807
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,394
I mean, you don't even call her
by her name.

808
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,478
Which is Chloe,
not "the detective."

809
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,756
It's endearing.

810
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,030
Oh, come on.

811
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,276
You believe
this guy, Cornelia?

812
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,396
Chloe is so much more

813
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,756
than work, man.

814
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,152
She's a friend.

815
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,999
She's a devoted parent
to Trixie.

816
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,476
- She's the most amazing human being I've...
- Daniel.

817
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,997
You ignorant, fearful
genius... you're right.

818
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,158
Really?

819
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,550
Indeed. To truly
understand

820
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,433
the detective's motivations,
I need to experience

821
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,199
the full spectrum
of her life.

822
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,039
- Okay.
- So what I need is a defenseless,

823
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,397
barely verbal creature
who depends entirely on me

824
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,432
- for her every need.
- What are you talking about?

825
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,438
I need a Trixie. I...

826
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,795
Hello.

827
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,277
- Uh, ew.
<i>- Maze,</i>

828
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,235
what part of co-hosting a bachelorette
party did you not understand?

829
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,830
Hey, nobody asked me
about any damn bus!

830
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,875
Yeah, so you throw my next best
chance for a sex life off it?

831
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,834
- And, you, why are you freaking Chloe out?
- Yeah, I should never

832
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,712
have invited her.

833
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,149
I was trying to help!

834
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,273
You know, a little
prenuptial conflict is healthy.

835
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,920
It's better to get it
out of the system.

836
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,190
Oh, you want conflict?

837
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,518
- Done!
- Okay, ladies, please.

838
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,071
- There's still time to fix this, okay?
- Come on, Maze.

839
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,357
matching tattoos.

840
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,437
What?

841
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,514
Fake tattoos. <i>Fake.</i>

842
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,796
Pierce tipped me off...

843
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,714
- Pierce was looking into fake tattoos?
- Yeah. I mean,

844
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,711
he made me promise

845
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,757
not to tell anyone...
but you know what?

846
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,480
Lying bastard!

847
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,319
Where is Maze going?

848
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,640
Bigger problem, girls.

849
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,590
Where'd Chloe go?

850
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,511
Oh...

851
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,030
<i>No, sit, child.</i>

852
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,920
Oh, goodness me.
<i>Sitzen.</i>

853
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,554
Oh, my
goodness.

854
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,637
This is ridiculous.

855
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,638
I mean, at least
the detective's human dependent

856
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,678
can be bribed
with chocolate and cash.

857
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,440
But apparently, chocolate's
toxic for Ms. Picky here.

858
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,391
And she ate my wallet.

859
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,637
- What is that smell? And why is there...
- Hmm?

860
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,560
- ...crime scene tape all around my desk?
- Because trust me, Daniel,

861
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,355
Cornelia committed a very
serious infraction over there.

862
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,676
Children are

863
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,599
so needy... I mean,
you wouldn't understand,

864
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,871
but being a single parent
is exhausting.

865
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,873
Dude, it's been an hour.

866
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,673
Well, in dog years,
that's an eternity.

867
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,912
Yeah, well, your parenting days
are over, okay?

868
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,315
Francis's husband Frederick
is here.

869
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,269
Frederick! Oh.
Good to see you again.

870
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,880
What a pity.
We were just bonding.

871
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,116
Thank you, Detectives.

872
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,159
I had no idea she was pregnant.

873
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,313
- Now I can start to rebuild our family.
- Well, if you just,

874
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,031
uh, sign the release form,

875
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,354
and she's all yours.

876
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,875
There's my good girl.

877
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,359
Ah...

878
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,990
Girl...

879
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,356
Oh, poor baby.

880
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,356
She's clearly
feeling the strain.

881
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,556
Cornelia?

882
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,592
Come.

883
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,950
Bye, child.

884
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,310
I'll really...

885
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,516
Good-bye.

886
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,395
Right, now, that's...

887
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,996
Where's he gone?

888
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,634
How you doing there, hon?

889
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,831
C... Can you see me?

890
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,595
I see a lot of things
on this bus.

891
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,753
Looks like something's
eating at you.

892
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,157
Well, it just...

893
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,158
it all happened so fast, and...

894
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,355
everyone's wondering
why I said yes, and...

895
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,876
I-I'm wondering
the same thing myself.

896
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,754
I don't know, m-maybe I thought

897
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,593
that marrying a...

898
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,639
a safe, steady guy would...

899
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,316
somehow... change me
into a different person,

900
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,957
and that-that maybe this new,
spontaneous me

901
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,913
would-would somehow...

902
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,190
inspire the...
the person that I still am.

903
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,074
Hey, are you married?

904
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,749
17 years.

905
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,800
He's my everything.

906
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,431
Hopefully, your guy is, too.

907
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,759
How does she even do this?

908
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,677
Well, that's odd.

909
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,272
Cornelia's prenatal examination
was signed by Frederick,

910
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,597
but he said he didn't know
about the pregnancy.

911
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,152
And the signature's a match.

912
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,114
Which means he lied.

913
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,674
Ergo...

914
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,159
he's most likely the killer.

915
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,511
Well done, Detective!

916
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,591
Well...

917
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,069
well done, Detective.

918
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,479
Get in here, you stupid mutt.

919
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,756
Come on!

920
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,631
- Is that how you treat a pregnant lady?
- What the...?

921
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,911
- How did you get in here?
- I had a hunch you were the killer.

922
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,232
When your "fur baby"
wouldn't go to you.

923
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,192
Cornelia only goes...

924
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,520
to people she trusts.

925
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,510
Not killers.

926
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,552
why, Frederick?

927
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,838
I'm more than happy
to discuss this with you

928
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,360
after I tend to Cornelia.

929
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,877
Listen.

930
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,830
You got to understand,

931
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,600
a dog is supposed to be
man's best friend,

932
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,359
not man's best replacement.

933
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,678
Do you know what it's like

934
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,912
to be kicked out
of your own bed by a dog?!

935
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,960
But... I could
never get up the nerve

936
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,958
to just tell Francis
what I wanted.

937
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,480
You were scared
of what the answer could be.

938
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,473
Then I found out
about the puppies.

939
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,156
Six more reasons
for him to neglect me.

940
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,555
And we fought...

941
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,155
and he fell,

942
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,316
and he hit his head.

943
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,751
It was an accident.

944
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,280
Why don't you just
put the gun down.

945
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,555
Come back to the station

946
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,480
and tell your side
of the story.

947
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,393
I should've just
shot the dog!

948
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,550
But it's so hard
to kill a creature

949
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,717
with such intelligence
in its eyes.

950
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,750
LAPD!

951
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,632
Wha...?

952
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,677
Ah. There you are.

953
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,354
Typical.

954
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,552
You leave me with the paperwork
and run off alone.

955
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,679
- No thought of danger, no thought of protocol...
- You really...

956
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,396
don't see the
irony, do you?

957
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,156
All I see, Daniel, is that I
can't rely on you as my partner.

958
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,239
So perhaps I should find someone
steady, someone responsible,

959
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,995
someone who can
actually be there for me.

960
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,598
Oh.

961
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,357
Oh.

962
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,640
I get it now.

963
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,200
So you thought I wouldn't
find out your mark is fake.

964
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,673
You know, for a guy
who's lived for a million years,

965
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,480
you're a real dumbass.

966
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,431
Shh.

967
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,150
She's asleep.

968
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,076
Can't use the kid
as a human shield forever, Cain.

969
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,949
Maybe not tonight...

970
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,034
...but I am coming for you.

971
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,520
Hey. You're here.

972
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,073
Why isn't Trixie
at her sleepover?

973
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,471
I stopped by to check on her,
and she wanted to come home.

974
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,638
Um...

975
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,713
about all this wedding stuff...

976
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,110
It's way too overwhelming.

977
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,198
- Yeah, I agree. It's, uh, it's-it's...
- Yeah.

978
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,959
Listen,
let's forget

979
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,595
about the whole "big event"
thing, okay? Life is too short.

980
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,751
- Too short, yeah.
- Yeah.

981
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:13,952
Let's elope.

982
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,594
We don't need
the whole circus.

983
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,632
It's about you and me.

984
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,750
Yeah.

985
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,952
And-and-and that's why I...

986
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,358
I can't marry you.

987
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,080
I'm sorry, Marcus.

988
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:41,878
Dan.

989
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,236
Are you okay?

990
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,276
Uh...

991
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,271
I don't know.

992
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,759
Got a lot of things on my mind.

993
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,315
Could be kind of serious.

994
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,273
Tell me about it.

995
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,119
I am... whew...

996
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,516
seriously wondering
why I said yes

997
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,200
to that fifth shot of tequila.

998
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,677
What is it?

999
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,839
Charlotte,
I know that, um...

1000
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,834
we've been keeping things
kind of loose,

1001
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,152
and I said that you
could use your space.

1002
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,919
And if that's
what you want...

1003
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,079
if that's what you truly want,
then I respect that.

1004
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,038
But... I never told you
what <i>I</i> want.

1005
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,589
I want you.

1006
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,311
All in.

1007
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,351
The whole deal.

1008
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,796
So, um...

1009
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,556
so there.

1010
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,677
Okay.

1011
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,437
Really?

1012
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,235
Ah. Detective.

1013
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,476
Good. You're back.

1014
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,800
I am. Yeah.

1015
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,594
Excellent, because...

1016
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,280
well, there's a few things
I need to say.

1017
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,240
- Hmm.
- You see, I've, um...

1018
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,197
well, I...

1019
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,754
I've actually learned
something for once.

1020
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,152
Oh.

1021
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,751
No ring.

1022
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,837
Yep, no ring.

1023
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,631
Oh.

1024
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,117
So, you were saying you learned
something?

1025
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,473
Oh. Oh, it's nothing.

1026
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,593
Nothing. Completely irrelevant.

1027
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,750
Right.

1028
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,351
Well...

1029
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,519
a new case just dropped, so...

1030
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,997
I was thinking...
back to work?

1031
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,831
Back to work.

1032
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,909
- After you.
- Thank you.

1033
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,674
- Shall we take my car?
- Yes.
