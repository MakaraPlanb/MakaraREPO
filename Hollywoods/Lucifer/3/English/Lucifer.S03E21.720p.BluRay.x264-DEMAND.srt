1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,430
<i>- Previously on</i> Lucifer...
- Is it possible

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,677
you're not dealing with
something? Chloe and Pierce?

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,234
Perhaps you're not
as okay with

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,960
that relationship
as you think.

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,560
<i>Decker's the one
who's gonna suffer.</i>

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,752
Getting her to fall for
you and then vanishing?

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,711
Ruthless.

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,070
I don't care who I have to hurt,

9
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,118
as long as it allows me
to finally die.

10
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,232
Neither I nor Lucifer
have the power

11
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,840
to get anyone into Heaven.

12
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,309
There's no hope
for me.

13
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,431
I'm going to Hell.

14
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,596
And I am sick

15
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,917
<i>of that stupid little brat
of yours.</i>

16
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,474
Pierce, I Io...

17
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,397
Stop.

18
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,431
I can't do this.

19
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,597
What?

20
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,312
<i>Why?</i>

21
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,876
<i>Why did you hurt her?</i>

22
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,317
Why?!

23
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,272
I couldn't...
hurt her like that.

24
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,994
Your mark. It's gone.

25
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,791
<i>Just like that... it's gone?</i>

26
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,074
I don't understand.
How?

27
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,991
How the hell

28
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,796
did you finally get rid
of your bloody mark?!

29
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,791
I don't know.

30
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,830
I guess the plan worked.

31
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,756
What plan?

32
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,192
The plan to get Chloe
to fall for me.

33
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,312
And why would you have
a plan for that?

34
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,637
'Cause I finally figured out
what makes us vulnerable.

35
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,830
Us?

36
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,195
It's Chloe's love.

37
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,550
Think about it.

38
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,999
She loves you, you bleed.

39
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,237
Now she loves me,
so I can die.

40
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,840
Well, congratulations,

41
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,918
'cause you've just come
to the most absurd

42
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,719
conclusion I think
I've ever heard.

43
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,391
Is it?

44
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,480
I tried to stop her
from saying the words.

45
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,909
I didn't want to hurt her.

46
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,594
I guess I was too late.

47
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,031
She already loved me.

48
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,311
Well, allow me to disabuse you

49
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,115
of your misguided notions.

50
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,154
Regardless of the detective's
possible affections,

51
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,919
I think the reason
that your mark is gone

52
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,156
is glaringly obvious,

53
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,191
isn't it?

54
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,029
The moment you chose
to pull the ripcord

55
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,230
on your dubious plan,

56
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,239
Dad chose to screw with you.

57
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,274
By giving you exactly
what you wanted.

58
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,914
I mean, come on, really.
It's God 101, isn't it?

59
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,395
I really wouldn't be so sure.

60
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,750
Well, you know what?
Who cares

61
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,030
<i>why</i> your mark is gone.

62
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,509
The point is that you,

63
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,677
my mortally challenged friend,
can now die.

64
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,874
So just say
the magic word

65
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,077
and I'll be... I'll be happy
to help you on your way.

66
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,910
Yeah? We'll go
old school, shall we?

67
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,317
Come on!

68
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,636
Let's rock and roll!

69
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,677
Stop.

70
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,837
I got it.

71
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,632
Are you sure?

72
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,439
'Cause really,
really, I don't mind.

73
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,518
I've got it.

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,831
Fine.

75
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,950
Suit yourself.

76
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,670
- I guess this is good-bye.
- Yeah.

77
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,156
But, on the bright side,

78
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,951
see you never.

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,719
Hey, Ella, do we have, uh...

80
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,791
the-the forensics
on the Duckworth case?

81
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,112
Dope shades, missy!

82
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,678
Thanks.

83
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,197
Yeah, I only wear mine inside
when I'm like, super hungover

84
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,631
or, you know, for some reason
I've been crying.

85
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,117
Right.

86
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,390
Oh, no.

87
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,871
What happened?

88
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,950
It's...

89
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,957
Pierce and I broke up.

90
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,957
What?

91
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,830
- Yeah.
- Why?

92
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,316
You were so great together.

93
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,517
Uh, yeah. I... I don't know.

94
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,352
I guess he just,
he freaked out and he ran.

95
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,752
I-I'm guessing

96
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,520
he's terrified of intimacy. I...

97
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,595
I'm just trying
not to take it personally,

98
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,395
'cause it's not like this is the
first time this has happened,

99
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,716
so I just...

100
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,554
wonder if it's something
I'm doing.

101
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,240
No way.

102
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,558
That is some bull to the crap,
right there.

103
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,910
Okay, anyhow...

104
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,395
I'm gonna walk
into Pierce's office

105
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,319
and I'm gonna give
that studly, big-armed man

106
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,317
a serious what for.

107
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,836
Hey.

108
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,635
Please do not say anything.

109
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,914
All right? It's just gonna
make things more complicated.

110
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,551
Fine.

111
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,433
Okay, I-I won't interfere.

112
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,200
How could you do this to her?

113
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,550
You made her so happy!

114
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,637
If you must know,

115
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,990
I was trying to protect her.

116
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,756
I broke things off

117
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,514
because I didn't want
to hurt Chloe.

118
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,234
I know you're my boss, so don't
take this the wrong way,

119
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,032
but do you know

120
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,919
how stupid that sounds?

121
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,480
If you really cared about her,

122
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,353
then what are you
protecting her from?

123
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,314
I guess nothing anymore.

124
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,435
I can actually be with her.

125
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,437
I can grow old with her.

126
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,233
Uh, maybe...

127
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,510
I mean, that's a little

128
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,194
cart before the horse,
don't ya think?

129
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,959
No, you're right, Lopez.
I totally screwed this up.

130
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,230
Yeah. You did.

131
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,837
I need to win her back.

132
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,712
Mm-hmm.

133
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,990
How am I gonna do that?

134
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,437
I have faith.

135
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,513
- Good morning!
- Morning.

136
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,480
Detective, uh, as someone
who goes to therapy,

137
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,273
I understand
you must have many...

138
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,312
feelings following
last night's debacle.

139
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,590
So, if you feel
the need to discuss...

140
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,240
No, it's okay. I really
don't want to talk about it.

141
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,920
Excellent.
I mean, you know,

142
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,395
whatever works for you
works for me.

143
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,311
After all, if all goes
as it should, we'll probably

144
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,955
never be hearing from
that lying lieutenant ever...

145
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,389
...again...

146
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,074
Shouldn't you be, uh,
I don't know,

147
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,436
having tea with
Hitler by now?

148
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,994
Change of plans.
I don't want to die anymore.

149
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,316
I want to win Chloe back.

150
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,317
I beg your pardon?

151
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,835
No time to explain.

152
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,873
Okay, I know you probably
hate me right now,

153
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,873
but please, just hear me out.

154
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,239
You were right, about
last night... I got scared.

155
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,552
Things got very real
between us and I...

156
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,798
...I couldn't handle it. Okay?

157
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,037
And... I'm not used
to feeling this way.

158
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,754
And I realize that
now and that's why

159
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,519
I promise it'll never
happen again, because...

160
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,439
...because I love you.

161
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,512
What?

162
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,190
I love you, Chloe.

163
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,720
Wh-What do you expect me
to say to that?

164
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,354
Well, that you love me, too.

165
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,590
Look, Marcus,
as much as I appreciate

166
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,395
hearing you say those words...

167
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,280
they're just words.

168
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,119
I can't trust them anymore.

169
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,439
<i>Our victim is Reina Markova,</i>

170
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,155
29, prima ballerina
for the L.A. West Ballet

171
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,919
four years and running.

172
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,600
Cleaning staff found her when
they came in this morning.

173
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,318
Any witnesses?

174
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,598
Uh, no. She's known
for taking rehearsals alone.

175
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,120
Especially when
she's two days away

176
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,515
from a big premiere
like <i>Giselle.</i>

177
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,154
Hmm. Hey, Ella.

178
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,750
Any idea of the time of death?

179
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,552
Looks like she was killed
roughly ten hours ago.

180
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,750
Oh, what a coincidence.

181
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,996
She's been dead almost as long

182
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,078
as your dreadful relationship
to Pierce.

183
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,398
They broke up?

184
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,954
Actually, he broke up with her.

185
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,032
- You kidding me?
- What about cause of death?

186
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,192
Right.

187
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,754
Well, according to

188
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,792
the ligature marks
on her throat,

189
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,474
she was strangled...

190
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,560
using the ties from this.

191
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,080
She was killed
with her own shoe?

192
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,680
Not her shoe.
Different size.

193
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,230
But why leave
the murder weapon behind?

194
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,755
Maybe whoever did this
freaked out and ran?

195
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,757
We've seen it before.

196
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,916
Oh, yes, we have,

197
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,715
from the lowest form of scum
on earth... like Pierce.

198
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,232
Well, come on.

199
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,920
I mean, we're all thinking it,
aren't we?

200
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,358
Anyway, time to get the slipper
back to the lab.

201
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,838
Any other questions,
here's my prelim.

202
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,434
Uh... I'm gonna
join her, 'cause...

203
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,710
because this is awkward.

204
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,230
Oh, and, uh,
personally,

205
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,556
I'm with you, buddy.

206
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,831
Screw that guy.

207
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,629
So, we're searching

208
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,751
for a murderous
Cinderella.

209
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,275
Yes, someone timelessly evil.

210
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,550
Almost like a cretinous
lieutenant named...

211
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,876
Enough, Lucifer.

212
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,309
This murder has
nothing to do with Pierce.

213
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,920
Well, not literally, perhaps...

214
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,395
I know you want me
to hate him.

215
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,273
To tell you he's terrible.

216
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,075
But the truth is,
our relationship

217
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,550
is none of your business.

218
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,598
- Former relationship, you mean?
- Yes.

219
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,711
- Yes.
- No, no...

220
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,274
- No?
- I-I don't, I don't know.

221
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,116
Point being,
you need to back off.

222
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,832
Whether I decide

223
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,475
to take Pierce back or not,
it just,

224
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,194
it has nothing to do with you.

225
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,278
Or maybe it still does.

226
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,311
Great news!

227
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,678
The detective still
makes me bleed.

228
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,991
Which means there's hope.

229
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,193
Uh, hope for...

230
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,234
Well, for the detective,
of course!

231
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,240
Hope that she hasn't
fully succumbed

232
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,477
to that intolerable knob,
Pierce.

233
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,916
Even if he has
lost his mark.

234
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,469
Pierce lost his what now?

235
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,160
Allow me to catch you up.

236
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,157
So, the lieutenant has
a ridiculous theory

237
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,119
that, shockingly,
may hold water.

238
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,953
He believes that
the detective's affections

239
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,156
are what make me vulnerable.

240
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,919
And now that
she cares for him...

241
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,800
well, long story short, old ham
hands isn't cursed anymore.

242
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,951
He's mortal.

243
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:08,992
So,

244
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,953
your vulnerability is proof

245
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,200
that Chloe cared for you...

246
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,630
but now she
cares for Pierce,

247
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,156
- so no <i>w he's</i> vulnerable, too.
- Close.

248
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,794
She cares for Pierce and me.

249
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,516
As proven by my bleeding.

250
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,112
Yet, for some
inexplicable reason,

251
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,039
she's on the fence
between the two of us.

252
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,799
And how does that make you feel?

253
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,159
Well, it makes me feel...

254
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,316
like I...

255
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,511
...like I need
to tip the scales in my favor.

256
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,917
Show her

257
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,800
which side
the grass is greener on.

258
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,595
And why do you want
to tip Chloe to your side?

259
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,200
Because, as her partner,

260
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,040
it's my duty to save her
from making a terrible mistake.

261
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,310
Uh-huh.

262
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,510
Pierce has clearly blinded her

263
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,676
with his charming oaf routine.

264
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,274
So I need to open her eyes.

265
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,837
Show her that I'm better
than him in every possible way.

266
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,952
And what if
Chloe does choose you?

267
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,073
Well, then, things can finally
go back to the way they were,

268
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,717
before Pierce, obviously.

269
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,040
Uh...

270
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,235
Why do I feel like I should've
stopped him this time?

271
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,630
<i>What the hell is this?</i>

272
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,554
It's pretty
self-explanatory.

273
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,593
- The plan is off.
- Why?

274
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,237
We were so close to getting
happily-sexed Decker

275
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,078
to fall for you.

276
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,631
Yeah, and I messed it up, okay?
I broke up with her.

277
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,870
You broke up with her?

278
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,200
What happened to getting rid
of your mark?

279
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,550
Doesn't matter.

280
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,317
I'm done with grand plans
and manipulations.

281
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,114
I don't want
to use Chloe anymore.

282
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,074
What about
what I want?

283
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,039
Because if we don't
get Chloe to love you,

284
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,560
then we can't
lift your curse.

285
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,919
And if we can't
lift your curse,

286
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,840
then I can't kill you
and hang it on Lucifer.

287
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,034
Framing Lucifer
for murder

288
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,232
is the only way to blow up
his life on Earth.

289
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,311
Keep your voice down.

290
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,550
What don't you get?

291
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,558
My side of the plan
doesn't work without yours.

292
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,189
And I need this

293
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,874
to get back to Hell.

294
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,630
I'm sorry.
Like I said, the plan's off.

295
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,675
Says you.

296
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,037
Detective.

297
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,196
Pardon my tardiness,

298
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,800
but I come bearing gifts.

299
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,593
What is this?

300
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,957
Well, I know how you like
your seasonal beverages,

301
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,833
so I got you a
"Luck o' the Irish" Latte

302
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,236
and... oh!
To be sure, to be sure,

303
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,351
little something extra.

304
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,471
Oh, y-you got me a lemon bar.

305
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,160
Mm, well, they're your
favorites, aren't they?

306
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,910
- Mm...
- Look, Detective,

307
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,476
I know that you're going through
a difficult time right now,

308
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,636
and what you need

309
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,717
is someone who knows you.

310
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,477
I know. It's just...

311
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,431
- Um...
- It's just what?

312
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,792
Ooh, lemon bars.
My favorite. Mmm.

313
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,112
Oh, man, these are amazing.
Who made 'em?

314
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,311
Uh, Pierce did.

315
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,273
Would you believe
that hunk bakes?

316
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,235
On second thought,
who needs the empty calories?

317
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,271
Hmm.

318
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,640
Hmm, looks like someone

319
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,599
is trying to crawl their way
out of the doghouse.

320
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,478
Mm-hmm

321
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,314
- Is it working?
- Yes, is it?

322
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,477
Let's just focus on the case.

323
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,797
Ella, what do you have?

324
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,560
Uh, so I got a lead
off the murder weapon.

325
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,992
No match on the DNA, but I did
find a signature of sorts.

326
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,634
The ballet shoe
had traces

327
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,991
of olive oil,
Evian and beeswax.

328
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,840
So our killer's a bumblebee
with expensive taste?

329
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,076
Or a ballerina.

330
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,595
Dancers all have
their own unique way

331
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,597
of prepping
their shoes.

332
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,439
And, according
to her social media,

333
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,916
guess who uses
those exact ingredients?

334
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,754
Reina's former
understudy

335
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,357
and L.A. West Ballet's
new prima ballerina,

336
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,194
Amber Fontaine.

337
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,197
So either she took out
her competition

338
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,880
or the killer somehow
got one of her shoes?

339
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,754
No, no, no, definitely looks
like a Black Swan to me.

340
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,516
And bras and up.
Ladies, arms out...

341
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,517
Sorry to interrupt.

342
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,710
We'd like to speak

343
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,718
- with Amber Fontaine.
- For what?

344
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,036
We're extremely busy here.

345
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,276
Yes, us, too.

346
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,830
Solving the crime of
a brutally murdered ballerina.

347
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,394
But Amber didn't have anything
to do with that.

348
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,353
And we only got two days

349
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,359
- to get this show up and running.
- Easy, easy, Gwen.

350
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,233
They're just
doing their jobs.

351
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,517
I'm sorry.

352
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,871
We're just all pretty
emotional right now.

353
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,316
Yes, clearly some
more than others.

354
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,197
We know it
was your shoe

355
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,914
that was used to strangle Reina.

356
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,510
That's crazy.

357
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,591
The killer must've stolen them
out of my locker.

358
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,395
I mean, Reina's locker.

359
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,035
Look, respect for going
full Tonya Harding,

360
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,640
but if you're
gonna kill someone,

361
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,160
you should get your story
straight first.

362
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,031
No, Reina's locker was mine
for, like, a week

363
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,914
when she left the company
for her new gig.

364
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,554
But when she came back,
I had to return it.

365
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,752
I-I must've left
my pointe shoes in there.

366
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,191
Where were you
last night?

367
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,237
Home.

368
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,397
Sleeping like a baby.
You can ask my roommate.

369
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,559
Now that Reina's dead,

370
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,353
I'm back to being tied in knots.

371
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,074
Yes, murder can do that.

372
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,919
No, as much as I
thought that I wanted

373
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,836
her spot, to be able to dance
with a legend like Miguel,

374
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,874
I-I wasn't ready.

375
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,594
I was happy to keep
learning from Reina.

376
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,277
I thought it was
our gain and their loss.

377
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,960
Whose loss exactly?

378
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,356
You know, <i>America's Next
Prima Ballerina.</i>

379
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,757
The TV show Reina
was gonna host.

380
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,158
You know, I'm inclined
to believe our young ingenue.

381
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,039
If there's nothing she and
Reina were competing for,

382
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,118
it makes her motive
far less compelling.

383
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,830
Yeah, we need to look
into this TV show,

384
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,474
see why she
turned it down.

385
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,558
Well, it certainly wouldn't
be art over commerce.

386
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,150
No one has that
kind of passion...

387
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,395
Are those from...

388
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,036
Marcus. Yeah.

389
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,438
Bastard.

390
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,078
Luci, what is so urgent?
Why'd you call me here?

391
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,237
Because enough is enough.
It's time.

392
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,953
We need to get rid of Pierce.

393
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,153
What exactly do you mean by

394
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,715
"get rid of Pierce"?

395
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,349
Well, what do you think I mean?

396
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,273
Yeah, we're not gonna
kill him, Luci.

397
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,592
I know, angels
can't kill humans,

398
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,116
yadda yadda yadda.

399
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,397
Spare me the lecture.
Besides, killing Pierce

400
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,716
isn't the answer anyway

401
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,479
because, inexplicable
as it is,

402
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,000
the detective actually
cares for the man,

403
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,720
and breaking her heart
isn't the goal.

404
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,751
I got to admit, I'm a little
fuzzy on that one myself.

405
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,717
What is the goal?

406
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,680
For the detective to realize
she needs to pick me

407
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,071
over that blithering clod,
Pierce, which...

408
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,240
gah, shouldn't even
be an issue, but...

409
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,399
- I'm in.
- You are?

410
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,990
You are my brother and my test.

411
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,670
Whatever needs to be done.

412
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,038
Well, I have to admit,

413
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,630
I didn't expect that
to be quite so easy,

414
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,957
but I'm not one to look
a gift-angel in the mouth,

415
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,071
I'll take it.

416
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,916
So what's the plan?

417
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,554
We need to make
the detective realize

418
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,991
that Pierce isn't the man
she thinks he is.

419
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,999
We need to prove to her

420
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,233
that he is a two-faced,
loathsome biblical liar.

421
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,112
I mean, how hard can that be?

422
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,356
He is the man behind the whole
Sinnerman thing, after all.

423
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,271
Um... what?

424
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,756
Oh, I'm sorry.
Didn't I tell you?

425
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,471
Pierce equals
criminal mastermind.

426
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,391
Anyway...

427
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,559
You run with that, and I'll
keep working on the detective.

428
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,636
<i>Read my lips:</i>

429
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,355
Dance is pain.

430
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,558
You want to feel sorry
for yourselves?

431
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,515
Then go back to Kansas
or wherever you're from.

432
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,632
That is Myles Druker.

433
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,799
Only one of the most amazing
choreographers in the world.

434
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,560
Choreographer
with a bum leg?

435
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,320
Is this one of those, "those
who can't, teach" scenarios?

436
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,678
He was a dancer who lost his leg
in a car crash.

437
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,518
Oh.

438
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,110
But he never believed
in playing the victim.

439
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,271
Instead,

440
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,995
he turned his tragedy
into an inspirational story

441
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,429
for all of us to follow.

442
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,232
He's also the creator of
<i>America's Next Prima Ballerina,</i>

443
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,635
the show that Reina
was gonna host,

444
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,156
until she reneged on her deal
and it cost him a fortune.

445
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,430
Right. Well, I don't see why

446
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,160
he wouldn't take
such a loss in stride.

447
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,514
- You see what I did there?
- Mm-hmm.

448
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,676
In stride?

449
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,513
You must be aware
that Reina Markova

450
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,790
was killed last night.

451
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,994
Yeah, I heard. Big whoop.

452
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,590
Well, for a potential
cold-blooded killer,

453
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,519
you're being quite... obvious.

454
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,440
I mean, I just don't think Reina
was much of a professional.

455
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,630
Then why'd you hire her?

456
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,275
Let's just say I was...
pressured

457
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,994
into our collaboration.

458
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,357
By whom?

459
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,069
By none of your business.

460
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,036
Look, I'm a very busy man,

461
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,311
so unless you're gonna charge me
with anything, we're done here.

462
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,158
Well, actually, no.

463
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,113
I just have
one more question.

464
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,596
Uh, take note,
Detective.

465
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,240
Here's something I can do
that other people,

466
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,920
rhymes with Shmierce, cannot.

467
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,956
Tell me,

468
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,755
what is it that you
truly desire?

469
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,839
- I wish...
- Yeah.

470
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,397
...that car crash
never happened.

471
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,796
Why? 'Cause it crushed your leg?

472
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,397
No.

473
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,479
Because it didn't crush my leg.

474
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,557
Oh!

475
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,074
Right, well.

476
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,470
Care to explain?

477
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,519
Everyone believes the accident
ruined my career.

478
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,391
Well, the truth is, it made it.

479
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,638
I built my brand
on the notion

480
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,394
that I could
overcome anything.

481
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,710
I walk around with
a prosthetic every day

482
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,195
covering my real leg.

483
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,230
Polypropylene.

484
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,910
Oh. So is that why
Reina left the show?

485
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,156
She found out you were a fraud?

486
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,996
No, she quit because I accused
her of blackmailing me.

487
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,631
I was sent an e-mail

488
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,355
with a video that exposed me...

489
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,075
you know,
with two working legs...

490
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,155
said that if I gave Reina a job,
the video would disappear.

491
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,111
So I did.

492
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,037
But she didn't send it?

493
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,230
Apparently not,

494
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,874
even though it was sent
from her e-mail address,

495
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,833
because when I confronted her,
she went ballistic.

496
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,475
Said that she didn't need any
handouts and quit right there.

497
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,592
But if she didn't blackmail you,
then who did?

498
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,911
Beats me.

499
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,796
Right. Well, you better not
be pulling our legs.

500
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,870
What are you doing here,
Charlotte?

501
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,116
Isn't it obvious?

502
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,312
I'm a terrible person that's...

503
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,477
that's led a terrible life,
so I'm...

504
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,559
I'm preparing myself
for damnation.

505
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,274
In a three-star hotel?

506
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,079
It's what I deserve.

507
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,959
Well, it's time to sober up.

508
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,594
I need your help
with a legal matter.

509
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,033
Don't you want to ask someone
less damned?

510
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:39,952
I don't think so.

511
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,514
I need to find
a way to prove

512
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,514
that Lieutenant Pierce
is the criminal mastermind

513
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,274
also known as
the Sinnerman.

514
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,911
Say again?

515
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,918
Lieutenant Pierce has been
leading a double life

516
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,713
for quite some time now.

517
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,077
I need to prove it,

518
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,240
and then I need get him
out of the picture

519
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,755
so that Lucifer
can be with Chloe.

520
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,232
I'm gonna need a little
bit more information.

521
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,599
A very long time ago,

522
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,593
God tasked me with blessing
a couple with a miracle child.

523
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,952
Now, that child
became Chloe Decker,

524
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,192
who, it appears,

525
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,960
was placed on this Earth

526
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,516
to cross paths with Lucifer.

527
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,639
Now, since Lucifer
is my test,

528
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,477
bringing those two together
must be my final task.

529
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,996
At which point,

530
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,189
hopefully I'll be restored
in my Father's eyes.

531
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,915
Okay, let me see if
I understand this correctly.

532
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,756
I help you,

533
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,349
I help enact God's will?

534
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,390
In a way, yes.

535
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,159
And could that...

536
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,557
put me in His good graces
as well?

537
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,038
Maybe.

538
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,831
Good enough.

539
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,151
I'm in.

540
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,673
And I think I know how
to get started.

541
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,591
Well, I'd say that was rather
impressive, wouldn't you?

542
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,951
I exposed a fraud of a man
and got us a lead.

543
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,356
It's like the whole world
is pointing towards,

544
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,795
well, me, today.

545
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,631
Yes, Lucifer,

546
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,433
very impressive.

547
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,552
Unfortunately,
until cyber traces

548
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,080
this blackmail e-mail,

549
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,515
we have nothing
to do tonight.

550
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,915
Oh, nonsense, nonsense.
The night's still young.

551
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,470
Why don't we, um,
I don't know,

552
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,513
- go for a drive?
- For a drive?

553
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,916
What are we, 80?
Why would we go for a dri...

554
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,677
Ta-da!

555
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,118
I mean, it's not
flowers, but

556
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,155
it does go zero to 60
in, well... fast.

557
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,472
You...

558
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,832
- You got me a car?
- Mm-hmm.

559
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,474
Wait, do you think this is
some sort of competition?

560
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,275
Of course. If it isn't
painfully obvious,

561
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,592
anything Pierce can do,
I can do better.

562
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,073
It's not about stuff,
Lucifer.

563
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,150
Thanks anyhow.

564
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,791
Good morning.

565
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,711
Good morning?

566
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,671
Last I checked,
didn't you move out?

567
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,435
It's mea culpa time.

568
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,036
I came to earn my way back

569
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,310
into the house.

570
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,631
Really? And how do you plan
on doing that?

571
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,152
Well, I tried to think
of something nice,

572
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,636
but that's not really
my strong suit.

573
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,076
But then I heard
you and Pierce broke up.

574
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,076
So, I figured
he hurt you.

575
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,834
Maybe I just hurt him back?

576
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,397
Thanks, but-but no.

577
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,239
I mean, at least not yet.

578
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,271
Ah.

579
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,712
Men are so
fricking confusing.

580
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,794
Yeah, they're dumb.
<i>Really</i> dumb.

581
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,878
Mm-hmm.

582
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,151
What happened?

583
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,791
Well...

584
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,837
one minute, things
with Marcus are great.

585
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,030
- Mm-hmm.
- And then the next,

586
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,999
he ends things, and, uh...

587
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,035
And now he's doing
all of these...

588
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,395
really, really sweet things
to win me back.

589
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,000
And it does seem
really nice,

590
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,032
but I just don't know
if I can trust it.

591
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:44,912
I don't know, ho...

592
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,674
how do you know
if you can trust people?

593
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,876
It's simple.
I can't.

594
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,430
People will always
let you down.

595
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,757
You know what
I do trust? Pain.

596
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,237
And I admit,

597
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,510
Pierce is in
a whole lot of it.

598
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,035
What?
How do you know that?

599
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,635
Well, I may have already gone
to his house to kick his ass

600
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,479
before it occurred to me
I should probably

601
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,239
have asked for permission.

602
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,391
- Maze...
- But I...

603
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,069
I stopped myself.
So there's that.

604
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,639
Oh, Pierce was putting on
a brave face,

605
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,753
but... dude was hurting.

606
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,555
Hey, Mom, what's for break...

607
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,591
Hey.

608
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,436
It's gonna...
take a little time.

609
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,150
Hey, Dan, what's up?

610
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,237
Cyber came back.

611
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,159
Turns out the blackmail
e-mail Myles got

612
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,680
pinged to an apartment
registered

613
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,360
to a William Sterling...

614
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,077
chairman of the board
of L.A. West Ballet,

615
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,080
well-known surgeon,
married, two children.

616
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,511
Why would he be trying
to get Reina a new job?

617
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,759
Uh, maybe he was trying to get
the company some press.

618
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,598
Who knows?

619
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,075
Uh, what's the address?

620
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,476
- Lucifer.
- Detective.

621
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,670
Good morning.
Please,

622
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,877
- come in.
- What are you doing here?

623
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,515
Well... I realized
that you were right.

624
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,393
It's not about the stuff
that I can give you,

625
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,716
it's about actions.

626
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,752
So, I decided to get
a jump on the case

627
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,474
and take a few things
off your plate.

628
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,553
Which, I might add, is
the opposite of Pierce,

629
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,956
whose job it is to
put things <i>on</i> your plate.

630
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,197
- Uh-huh. Where's Sterling?
- Not here.

631
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,039
Which is convenient,
as it's given me time

632
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,799
to learn a few things
about our, well,

633
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,673
slightly deranged
suspect.

634
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,635
Lucifer, did you
break in here?

635
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,916
Detective...

636
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,033
I'm disappointed you'd
think so little of me.

637
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,600
Would you believe it
if I told you

638
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,871
an attractive neighbor
with a key simply let me in?

639
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,750
Unfortunately, yes.

640
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,031
Excellent. Then,
on with the tour.

641
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,038
So, I have come
to the conclusion

642
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,550
that we are inside the lair
of a creepy stalker,

643
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,910
evidenced by photos

644
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,157
of Sterling with Reina.

645
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,396
Clearly photoshopped.

646
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,315
Uh, some of her

647
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,920
undergarments
lying around.

648
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,759
Don't want to know
how he got those.

649
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,675
And, um...
for the grand finale...

650
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,189
a shrine dedicated
to Reina's old costumes.

651
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,551
Probably liked the smell
of her old sweat... disgusting.

652
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,837
Lucifer, I think...

653
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,520
Sterling is a lovesick obsessive

654
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,870
who wanted to see
Reina's star rise?

655
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,309
Yes, me too.
But clearly his gift

656
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,432
of a shiny new job
wasn't met kindly,

657
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,438
and so he...

658
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,431
Aha!

659
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,518
Ha, I caught you,
you sicko!

660
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,677
What did I say, Detective?

661
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,439
Actions, not stuff.

662
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,633
Lucifer, let him go.
He's not a stalker.

663
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,479
He and Reina were
having an affair.

664
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,600
Isn't that right,
Mr. Sterling?

665
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,156
Uh...

666
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,073
I never met anyone
quite like her.

667
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,113
She was the love
of my life.

668
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,876
You mean, the love
of your Tuesday afternoons

669
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,639
and occasional Saturday
mornings, don't you?

670
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,509
You are married,
with offspring,

671
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,631
are you not?

672
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,432
You don't always get to pick
who you fall in love with.

673
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,192
Is that why you
blackmailed Myles Druker,

674
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,432
to show Reina
how much you cared?

675
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,274
I don't know what
you're talking about.

676
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,154
There's a blackmail video that
was sent from Reina's e-mail.

677
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,919
It was pinged from
this physical address,

678
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,310
and that's why
Myles hired her.

679
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,397
And when she
found out, she quit.

680
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,796
Did she confront you?
Rebuff you?

681
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,315
'Cause it can be
quite daunting

682
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,920
when somebody doesn't
appreciate your gifts.

683
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,474
Perhaps you,

684
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,239
oh, I don't know,
lost your temper.

685
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,992
Uh, that's absurd.
I didn't care

686
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,350
who Reina worked with.

687
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,880
I certainly wouldn't
hurt her over it.

688
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,150
But if you didn't
send the e-mail,

689
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,794
- then who did?
- Mm.

690
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,195
I don't know.

691
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,955
Maybe someone snuck
onto her computer.

692
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,072
- Is that her computer?
- Yeah.

693
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,516
Who else knows
about this place?

694
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,594
No one, I thought.

695
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,477
Guess I was wrong.

696
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,870
Okay, well,
we're gonna need to

697
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,918
take the computer
into evidence.

698
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,400
I cannot believe

699
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,875
how well this is working out.

700
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,510
I mean, finding Pierce
with a known fence?

701
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,189
Who knew the LAPD
could be so helpful?

702
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,153
Well, the LAPD
didn't help with this.

703
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,953
I called in a favor,
had Pierce's phone hacked.

704
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,196
Charlotte!

705
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,796
If I wanted
to break the law,

706
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,320
I wouldn't have
gone to a DA.

707
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,079
And if I hadn't cut corners,
we wouldn't be here

708
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,034
as quickly or efficiently
or as... Well, hell, who cares?

709
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,038
We're working
for God now. Right?

710
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,439
Well...

711
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,120
...can't argue with results.

712
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,869
Okay, I think we got
what we need.

713
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,715
Uh, not exactly.

714
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,640
I'm afraid all that you have
are a few photos of an envelope.

715
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,950
If we want to expose Pierce,

716
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,600
we have to find out
what's inside.

717
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,030
Aw, crap.
He's on the move.

718
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,358
Well, maybe we...

719
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,796
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna
need to borrow your bike.

720
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,231
Don't worry, it's for God.

721
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,151
Who are you?

722
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,470
Why are you following me?

723
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,837
I said, who are you?

724
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,869
Ms. Richards.

725
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:46,997
Why are you...

726
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,560
Following you?

727
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,715
Well, it seems I let
my better judgment

728
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,195
get away from me.

729
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,151
I don't understand.

730
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,000
It's complicated.

731
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,191
See...

732
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,030
...when I heard that
you and Chloe broke up,

733
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,880
I started thinking
about you.

734
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,557
I know how hard it is

735
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,757
to be stuck
in a dark place.

736
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,197
Sometimes, all it takes
is the right person

737
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,470
to get you out.

738
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,716
After all...

739
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,510
...we both have needs.

740
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,509
Another time.

741
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,195
Hell, I'd be the luckiest
guy in the world,

742
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,715
but I'm in love with Chloe.

743
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,637
Sorry.

744
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,076
I know we knew
what was on this video,

745
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:42,035
yet somehow actually seeing
Myles' fake-fake leg...

746
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,993
- so much grosser.
- Great.

747
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,156
The man's an embarrassment

748
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,919
to both dance and prosthetics.

749
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,634
Well, we're just lucky
that cyber could retrieve this

750
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,109
from Reina's computer.

751
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,478
Dan, is there any way to tell
who made this from the footage?

752
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,393
Nothing, no voice.
Not even a measly cough.

753
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,114
Whoever did this was
pretty damn careful.

754
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,073
Yeah, we're still waiting
for DNA results

755
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,316
from the computer's keyboard,

756
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,314
but if the killer wore gloves,
I mean, we're out of luck.

757
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,790
It's Pierce.

758
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,039
Well, someone needs
to hit "ignore."

759
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,316
We'll get it.

760
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,231
Hey, Pierce, what's up?

761
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,715
Chloe, hi.

762
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,513
Listen, I realize that
lemon bars and flowers

763
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,597
aren't gonna cut it.

764
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,639
I think I figured out a way
to prove to you

765
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,518
you can trust me.

766
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,030
Can you meet me at my place for dinner tonight?
-00?

767
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,230
Eh, I don't know.

768
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,430
Chloe, please.

769
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,869
Listen, if you don't want
to see me after,

770
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,151
I promise I will never
bother you again.

771
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,830
Just... just come over.

772
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,396
You gotta eat, right?

773
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,716
Okay. Yeah, I can do dinner.

774
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,831
Great. I'll see you then.

775
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,276
- Detective.
- Hmm?

776
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,080
I couldn't help but overhear
a part of your call

777
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,959
and I understand
that you're torn,

778
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,640
but before
you make a decision

779
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,320
about Pierce
I'd like the chance

780
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,239
to express some thoughts
to you, as well.

781
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,397
Okay. Go ahead.

782
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,151
Right, well, I...

783
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,753
Actually, can we do this
in private?

784
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,349
My place, one hour?

785
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,354
Uh... okay.

786
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,276
Lovely.

787
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,229
Detective.

788
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,876
Thank you for coming.

789
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,677
I thought you were having me
over to tell me something?

790
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,633
Well, all shall be
explained in due time.

791
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,911
But please, take a seat.

792
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,276
Now, I hope you like

793
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,630
chateaubriand.

794
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,510
Um...

795
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,870
Lucifer,
what is all this?

796
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,037
This is to help you

797
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,434
make an appropriate decision
about your future

798
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,710
and, dare I say,

799
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,237
our future.

800
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,078
Now, we've been through
a lot, Detective.

801
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,871
But now the two of us are alone
in front of this beautiful meal

802
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,551
in this romantic setting,
I can finally

803
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,633
ask you the question I
brought you here to answer

804
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,436
and I hope, well, I hope you can
answer honestly.

805
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,557
Isn't this better than anything
Pierce could do?

806
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,391
You did all of this to...
to show up Pierce?

807
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,990
It's impressive. I know.

808
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,676
Detective.

809
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,589
Those aren't tears of joy,
are they?

810
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,679
Why are you doing this to me?

811
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,079
To prove to you that you
shouldn't be with Pierce.

812
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,873
Why do you care who I'm with?

813
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,313
'Cause he...
he doesn't deserve you.

814
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,910
Then who does deserve me?

815
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,950
Someone...

816
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,350
someone better.

817
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,277
You can't have it both ways,
Lucifer.

818
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,478
Detective, I...

819
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,111
Hey, Dan. What's up?

820
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,037
We got a lead.

821
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,880
So, DNA on the computer
came back negative.

822
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,596
So, we decided we had to watch
the creepy leg video again.

823
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,950
But that's when we saw it,

824
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,913
hidden in the
window's reflection.

825
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,032
It looked like one of those
Magic Eye pictures.

826
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,118
- You know the ones where it looks like...
- G-Guys, what did you see?

827
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,436
- Oh. Yeah.
- Oh, right. Yes.

828
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,791
We are sending over
the enhanced image as we speak.

829
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,593
Recognize that costume?

830
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,152
Okay, we know
Miguel is behind the video,

831
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,591
but what I don't understand
is why.

832
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,760
Why would he
risk everything

833
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,276
just to get rid of Reina?

834
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,830
Well, isn't it obvious?

835
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,190
He wanted to be with her.

836
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,477
There.

837
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,270
Why did you do it?!

838
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,632
Why did you have to take Reina
away from me?

839
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,751
Answer me.
Why did you kill Reina?

840
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,431
Drop the weapon!

841
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,439
You had no right!
You had no right!

842
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,437
Wa i t!

843
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,397
Don't you see?

844
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,034
He didn't want to kill Reina.

845
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,276
Lucifer, get back.

846
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,596
He tried
everything to simply

847
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,950
get her out of the way.

848
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,992
All those times you
came to pick her up.

849
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,116
She was your friend.

850
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,596
How could you hurt her?

851
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,590
I thought he cared for her.

852
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,435
Yes. But she was
also an obstacle

853
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,435
to being with the woman
Miguel loved... Amber.

854
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,955
But why kill Reina?

855
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,391
Because she found out I was
trying to blackmail Myles.

856
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,397
She was gonna get me fired.

857
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,636
And then he wouldn't
even be able

858
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,194
to work in the same company
as Amber.

859
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,352
Why didn't you just tell Amber
how you feel?

860
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,756
Tell her the truth?

861
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,071
Because...

862
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,950
I was afraid.

863
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,309
Afraid she wouldn't
love you back.

864
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,799
But I do.

865
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,512
I-I do have feelings
for you, Miguel.

866
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,996
I'm sorry.

867
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,634
I'm so sorry.

868
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,637
To think...

869
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,600
you could've had
everything you wanted.

870
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,996
All you needed to do
was tell Amber how you felt,

871
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,876
but you blew it.

872
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,430
And so did I.

873
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,678
It's got to be
around here somewhere.

874
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,431
Oh, I got it.

875
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,991
It's empty?

876
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,794
I don't understand.

877
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,954
Was he on to us?

878
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,595
I mean...
...did he destroy what's inside?

879
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,475
Maybe he just took it with him.

880
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,317
I'm sorry, Charlotte.

881
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,556
We did everything
that we could.

882
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,920
We're just too late.

883
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,440
Don't be ridiculous.

884
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,113
If I believed in "too late"
I wouldn't be doing any of this.

885
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,234
No, we are not giving up.

886
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,434
After all, you don't quit
when you're doing God's work.

887
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,515
I'm so sorry.

888
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,515
Ever since you left my office,
I've been struggling

889
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,712
between my role
as your therapist

890
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,912
and my concern for
you as a friend.

891
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,076
Friendship won.

892
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,394
But too late, it seems.

893
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,194
Well, I royally screwed up
this time, Linda.

894
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,112
Turns out

895
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,198
I'm just as bad as our killer.

896
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,470
Oh, God. You killed Pierce?

897
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,919
No.

898
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,716
No.

899
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,840
But I did try everything to get
that lovesick, former immortal

900
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,191
out of the picture when
really all I should've done

901
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,440
was told the detective
how I felt...

902
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,554
...how I really feel.

903
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,000
Then why don't you?

904
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,360
I can't.

905
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,071
What are you so afraid of?

906
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,955
At first it was
your devil face.

907
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:38,952
What now?

908
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,317
You don't want Chloe to
see that you have wings?

909
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,512
Who cares?

910
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,030
- I do! I care!
- Why?!

911
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,197
Because she doesn't have
a choice, does she?

912
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,870
Neither do I!

913
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,879
It's all part of His master plan
to toy with us,

914
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,197
to make us dance
for His bloody amusement.

915
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,834
That's an excuse.

916
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,749
Don't you see?

917
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,993
You're doing the same
thing as Him now.

918
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,073
By not telling
Chloe the truth,

919
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,832
you're taking her choice away.

920
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,837
No.

921
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,634
No.

922
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,035
No, it's different.

923
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,794
You know, the truth is...

924
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:17,318
no one really knows what
your dad's responsible for.

925
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,239
We're all just guessing.

926
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,271
Even you.

927
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,151
But you know the one thing
He can't control?

928
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:31,200
What you do in this moment
right now.

929
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,240
So I ask you,

930
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,750
the Devil...

931
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,474
what do you truly desire?

932
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,717
I want her to choose me.

933
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,356
Then tell her.

934
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,997
Yes.

935
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,436
Yes.

936
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,189
I'm sorry for
just stopping by,

937
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,516
but when you didn't
make dinner...

938
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,190
No, I, i-it's... I'm sorry.

939
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,830
This case has,
you know, been...

940
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,435
It's okay.

941
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,593
I can say what I need
to say here... now.

942
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,551
Okay.

943
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,952
For days I've been thinking
about how I screwed up.

944
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,319
Tried to figure out how
to make things better.

945
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,239
When you find that person
who gives life meaning,

946
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,675
Chloe, nothing else matters.

947
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,276
Okay, well...

948
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,960
I know you don't trust me.
I know I've made mistakes.

949
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,352
I've made an eternity's worth
of mistakes.

950
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,439
But please, let me spend
the rest of my days

951
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,551
making it up to you.

952
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,880
What? What are you doing?

953
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,198
Chloe Decker,
will you marry me?

954
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,432
Yes.
