1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,196
<i>- Previously on</i> Lucifer...
- I'm going to remove

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,669
<i>Pierce's immortal curse</i>

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,030
so he can finally die.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,560
<i>I shall fly down to Hell,</i>

5
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,594
pluck your brother's soul
and drop it into a vacant body.

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,792
This would make you innocent.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,957
- Amenadiel's nice.
- If he were nice,

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,669
<i>he wouldn't be sneaking around
behind my back with my friend.</i>

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,430
When will you understand that
we were trying to protect you?!

10
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,676
I don't believe you.

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,031
I know this is scary,
but we need to start

12
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,310
- in your Hell.
<i>- There are</i>

13
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,115
so many things that Father
can still take away from you.

14
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,117
<i>There is a bomb.</i>

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,390
<i>If they move,
the whole thing blows.</i>

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,114
I just wanted
to say thank you again.

17
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,073
- I couldn't have done it without you.
- Without me,

18
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,357
you wouldn't have been in danger
in the first place.

19
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,597
If the detective had died,
it would have been my fault.

20
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,631
<i>I know I promised</i>

21
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,990
to help you end your curse,

22
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,954
but we need to dissolve
our unholy alliance.

23
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,958
The risk is too great.

24
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,636
I'll put it on.

25
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,515
Ladies and gentlemen, Axara!

26
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,714
Oh, my God, Jill?

27
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,038
- Jill?
- Stay back! Everyone, stay back!

28
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,117
Jill?

29
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,391
Oh, Jill.

30
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,715
Jill?

31
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,036
Help me!

32
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,674
Someone help!

33
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,198
Somebody help!

34
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,753
I've decided to take myself <i>out</i>
of the spotlight.

35
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,917
My Father's spotlight,
to be exact.

36
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,035
So, no more killing Pierce
to get back at your dad?

37
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:21,997
Correct.

38
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,232
I mean, that whole "mark of
Cain" thing was so dreary,

39
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,840
so nihilistic.

40
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,840
There are far better ways
to spend my time.

41
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,230
- Oh?
- Yes.

42
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,399
Well, I could brew my own
artisanal beer.

43
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,633
Take a nude painting class.

44
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,678
Buy that pet shark
I've always wanted.

45
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,480
Maybe you're taking a step back
because of the bomb scare

46
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,918
that threatened
both you... and Chloe.

47
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,110
Don't be ridiculous.

48
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,232
We're in the line of fire
every day, doctor.

49
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,556
I mean, it's all part
of being heroes

50
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,513
- for the people.
- Don't get me wrong,

51
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,480
If the bomb <i>was</i> God targeting
Chloe for your defiance,

52
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,149
then maybe it's good
that you're quitting.

53
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,512
Well, quitting is a strong word.

54
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,717
I'm just saying,

55
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,479
sometimes we push
boundaries we shouldn't,

56
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,798
and cause rifts with
people we care about.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,638
It's only fair

58
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,196
we take our share
of responsibility in a conflict,

59
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,870
even if the other is...
somewhat irrational,

60
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,319
demonic, even.

61
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,830
Indeed. Nothing wrong

62
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,440
with dousing the flames
of contention.

63
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,915
- Exactly.
- Right.

64
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,672
- Maybe even apologize.
- Well, let's not go crazy.

65
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,000
But perhaps I <i>can</i> stop poking
the bear that is my Father.

66
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,232
Get off his radar
for a bit, you know?

67
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,351
Mellow out.

68
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,800
What do you want, Lopez?

69
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,192
You know, I just noticed that
you may be a little blue.

70
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,198
So...

71
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,037
Ta-da!

72
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,031
To cheer you up.

73
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,152
Nope, it's not new kicks.
It's better.

74
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,716
It's... a compliment box.

75
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,912
I went around the precinct
and asked everyone

76
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,958
to write a positive
little note about you.

77
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,276
- Why?
- So...

78
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,039
that whenever
you're feeling down,

79
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,039
you can just pull one out,
and it'll perk you right up.

80
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,872
Like, maybe <i>now</i> would be a good time.

81
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,712
"Pierce has nice arms."

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,640
Well, agreed. You sure do.

83
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,159
"The lieutenant has
really great arms."

84
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,000
Right again.
Two arms, two compliments.

85
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,356
"Pierce...

86
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,391
"is...

87
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,639
"wicked smart, <i>so</i> funny,

88
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,679
generous and amazing."

89
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,194
Now that is a compliment.

90
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,233
It says I have really nice arms,
doesn't it?

91
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,030
Nah, nah, 'cause
that'd be really awkward

92
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,675
and weird, you and me here
talking about a third arm.

93
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,630
And, um, I need to go
check on a lab thingy.

94
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,316
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

95
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,040
I've been trying so
hard to cheer up Pierce,

96
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,438
but this is some
next level bro-wallow.

97
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,474
You got to get in there
and do something.

98
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,751
Yeah. I don't know.

99
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,553
- What? Why not?
- Well, it's just...

100
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,874
Pierce isn't really a fan of me.

101
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,072
Well, then this is your
chance to change that.

102
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,239
I mean, Dan, if anyone
knows what it feels like

103
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,113
to be in the crapper, it's you.

104
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,994
- Thank you.
- No. What I mean is you can relate, okay?

105
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,396
But when you're
down, you always,

106
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,240
always pull yourself back up.

107
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,032
You are positive
dude <i>numero uno.</i>

108
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,229
Okay. I guess I could try.

109
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,156
Good luck.

110
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,111
You got this.

111
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,390
Hmm.

112
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,354
Okay,
I'm a little confused here.

113
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,791
One of the backup dancers
was dressed as Axara?

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,719
- Yeah. I don't really understand it, either.
- Yeah.

115
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,357
- she was looking to get...
- Okay, but you're the manager, correct?

116
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,556
Rohan Donahue, yeah.

117
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,671
So, here's the deal.

118
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,435
Axara and a backup dancer, Jill,

119
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,518
decided to switch positions
last minute.

120
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,513
Maybe she felt the act
was getting boring.

121
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,672
You'll have to ask Axara
for details.

122
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,678
We got her back to the hotel
as fast as possible.

123
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,599
So was this the first time
she had switched?

124
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,235
Yeah, she didn't say anything
to anyone on the crew.

125
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,716
Except for Jill, of course.

126
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,515
And no one knew, that means
Axara <i>was</i> the intended target.

127
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,995
Let's not jump
to any conclusions

128
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,475
until we've explored
all the angles.

129
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,433
We don't know
if anyone was a target.

130
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,511
Maybe it was an accident.

131
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,392
It wasn't.

132
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,157
This is a piece of big-time
professional firework.

133
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,430
"Ooh!"

134
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,750
"Ah!"

135
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,632
Fireworks weren't even

136
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,796
part of Axara's show.

137
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,680
Let alone pointed
right at the spotlight.

138
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,997
Does this mean we're cancelling
the Asia and the Europe tours?

139
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,159
Let's not panic until we know
exactly what happened here.

140
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,675
Jill's dead, Rohan.

141
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,434
And it was supposed to be Axara.

142
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,236
Yes, which means the shadowy
assassin would likely try again.

143
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,877
And again,

144
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,480
until the butchery
is done.

145
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,350
Statistically speaking.

146
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,192
- He's right.
- Okay.

147
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,629
As long as Axara's
in the spotlight,

148
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,160
she has a target on her back.

149
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,316
Yes.

150
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,319
The spotlight
is dangerous.

151
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,870
Who am I kidding?

152
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,351
I'm not mellow.

153
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,516
I'll never be able
to take myself out

154
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,518
of my dad's spotlight, but...

155
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,154
I can take the detective
out of mine.

156
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,999
And focus
on other people.

157
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,390
What? What are you
talking about?

158
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,717
Nothing.

159
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,274
You'll thank me later.

160
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,516
<i>So you're Axara's
bodyguard, are you?</i>

161
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,831
Now, I've always had an interest

162
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,952
in the personal
protection business, Rob.

163
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,998
- Bob.
- Bob, right.

164
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,196
Is that short
for "Robert"?

165
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,356
No.

166
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,716
Fascinating.

167
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,673
Oh, it's lovely getting
to know you like this.

168
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,872
Your hopes,
your dreams. Hmm?

169
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,919
Been working out as well.

170
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,271
Are you coming?

171
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,358
Uh, no, I'm not really
interested in you

172
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,119
and what you're doing. I think
I'm just gonna stay here

173
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,800
and chat to
my new friend, Rob.

174
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,391
- Bob.
- Bob.

175
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,351
Right. Bob.

176
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,630
Big fan of old
Bobby here.

177
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,310
In fact, if someone
were wondering about

178
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,520
my list of favorite people,
Bob might just be at the top.

179
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:07,952
Really?

180
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,276
Oh, most definitely.

181
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,629
We should go upstairs.

182
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,837
Thank you, Bobby.

183
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,760
I thought rock stars only got the best weed.

184
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,110
It's sage.

185
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,199
After what happened to Jill,
I'm smudging my space,

186
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,110
and my heart.

187
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,636
And my lungs.

188
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,354
It actually changes
the ionic composition

189
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,550
of the air and reduces

190
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,479
the body's stress response
to tragic events.

191
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,750
Oh, such compassion

192
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,711
from one so young.

193
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,354
Please, tell me more.

194
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,358
Can you think of anyone
who may have wanted to hurt you?

195
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,398
You should check
Axara's social media.

196
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,233
So many obsessed crazies.

197
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,476
Love you, Cece.

198
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,273
And she makes a mean
turmeric smoothie.

199
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,879
Wait, speaking of mean,

200
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,999
there was one guy who did
kind of threaten me.

201
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,550
I mean, I didn't take it
seriously at the time

202
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,439
because he's a bit
of a diva, but...

203
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,110
- Patrick.
- Patrick.

204
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,800
And who might Patrick be?

205
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,554
My ex-backup singer.

206
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,349
Really toxic
individual.

207
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,957
Rohan fired him last week, and
like I said, he's a drama queen.

208
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:07,832
But he said something

209
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,791
like, uh,

210
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,794
"I hope Axara dies
a horrible, painful death."

211
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:12,997
Yes.

212
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,957
Mm, mm.

213
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,593
Suppose it might
be worth a glance.

214
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,514
Maze, it's-it's me.

215
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,796
Linda.

216
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,517
Come on, Maze, I...

217
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,791
I brought you a gift to,
you know, bury the hatchet.

218
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,952
I don't want
to lose you, Maze.

219
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,197
And so,

220
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,519
I lost Amenadiel.

221
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,517
No man is worth
what we have.

222
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,151
Please, just hear me out.

223
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,629
Oh, excuse us. I think we're in
the wrong interrogation room.

224
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,513
You're looking
for Patrick Manning?

225
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:26,998
Yes.

226
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,993
- That's me, honey.
- Wow.

227
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,431
I see someone stole some
of Axara's spotlight

228
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,638
<i>and</i> fishnets as severance pay.

229
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,870
Why am I here?

230
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,673
I'll ask the questions, Patty.

231
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,712
Oh, I always knew Cher
was a feisty one.

232
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,594
I'm Donovan McCann,
Patrick's lawyer.

233
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,678
So, why is he here?

234
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,950
We believe
that Patrick made

235
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,192
an attempt on Axara's
life last night.

236
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,880
Killed a backup dancer
by mistake.

237
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,349
- Say what?
- We know that you still

238
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,119
had the backstage security pass,

239
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,436
which means
access and motive.

240
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,756
Yes,
cold-blooded retaliation

241
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,116
for your recent firing.

242
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:56,958
Firing?

243
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:57,957
That's bananas.

244
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,560
So, you're saying you didn't try

245
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,790
and take Axara
out with a bang?

246
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,911
Course not.

247
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,871
Do I hate her?

248
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,752
Yes.

249
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,673
It was a bitch
to work for that bitch...

250
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,758
the long hours,
never getting credit...

251
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,155
but she did not fire me.

252
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,472
I quit.

253
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,875
That's not the story
her people are telling.

254
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,436
I bet. Those sycophants
will say anything

255
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,790
to protect
her fragile ego.

256
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,072
Well, Patrick. Patty.

257
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,437
If you didn't want Axara dead,
tell me:

258
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,240
what did you desire?

259
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,713
Uh... to be Axara.

260
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,471
But my version.

261
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,309
A better version.

262
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,151
Which is why I could never
want her dead.

263
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,913
How could I compete with her
if she was kaput?

264
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,512
Yes.

265
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,637
Where were you last night?

266
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,069
On stage.

267
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,034
Performing my act at
the Hideaway in WeHo.

268
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,074
After which, she was mobbed
by fans in the parking lot.

269
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,157
Tuesday's the new Friday

270
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,794
now that Patty's
doing Axara.

271
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,520
- Mm-hmm.
- Ask around.

272
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,677
Aw, so sweet.

273
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,360
Donovan was right
about last night.

274
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,193
It was cray-cray
at the Hideaway.

275
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,634
Everyone wants a piece
of Axara 2.0.

276
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,600
You wouldn't believe
the obsessive wannabes.

277
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,033
- Sad.
- It's sad.

278
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,831
Axara has more followers
than the Pope.

279
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,879
"You are my life, I would do
anything to meet you.

280
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,514
Literally anything."

281
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,758
Gosh, I can't think of anyone
I care about that much.

282
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,476
Except for Miss Lopez.

283
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,676
World's Greatest

284
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,553
Forensic Scientist?

285
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,353
Oh, my gosh.

286
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,432
That is so sweet.

287
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,120
Wait. Did I miss my birthday?

288
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,551
Well, every day's a celebration
when you're around, darling.

289
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,952
Mwah!

290
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,477
Anyway.

291
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,235
when obsessed people don't have
their love reciprocated,

292
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,954
sometimes they snap.

293
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,475
Well, I've gone through
them all,

294
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,876
and on a scale of #ILoveYouAxara

295
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,600
to #IWantToLiveInYourSpleen,

296
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,314
there's, like,
a zillion suspects.

297
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,279
A zillion and one
if you count me.

298
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,193
You weren't even aware of her
until this case.

299
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,556
Okay, name your favorite song.

300
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,632
Well, um,
there's so many.

301
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,038
Anyway, we're not just
looking for a crazy fan,

302
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,516
we need someone who had
an all-access pass.

303
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,433
Well, Axara's assistant
let me check out

304
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,353
- all of her social media accounts.
- Mm-hmm.

305
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,950
And apparently, she held
an online contest last week.

306
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,040
Winner won a VIP pass to
the Hollywood Bowl show.

307
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,438
Benny Parker.

308
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,109
And these
are some of his tweets.

309
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,591
"I can't wait
for our love to be real."

310
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,880
"I will <i>make</i> you feel
the same way."

311
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,680
"You and I will be
together forever."

312
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,637
That's subtle.

313
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,115
Sounds like Prince Charming

314
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,960
needs some attention
from the LAPD.

315
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,277
Right.

316
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,109
Thank you, Miss Lopez.

317
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,232
I mean...

318
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,836
Oh, no,
poor Pauline.

319
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,191
Pauline?

320
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,756
My friend who works the
intake desk at the precinct.

321
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,474
I'm helping her through
a bad breakup.

322
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,792
We've grown quite close
since yesterday.

323
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,552
Mm-hmm. Right.

324
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,190
I know what you're doing.

325
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,311
Our bomb scare made you realize
just how dangerous this job is.

326
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,995
And that you and I
could lose each other.

327
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,151
At any time.

328
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,113
So you're focusing
on other people,

329
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,754
you're keeping
your distance

330
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,110
as a way of protecting yourself.

331
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,276
And you know what, Lucifer?

332
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,552
That's cool.

333
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,638
If you need to
"reverse-Oprah" me

334
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,195
just to feel
less afraid,

335
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,472
then by all means,
knock yourself out.

336
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,320
What?
I am not afraid.

337
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,472
Just realized I've been
a tad myopic lately.

338
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,120
- Why not spread the love?
- Hmm.

339
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,913
I mean, everyone deserves
a little Lucifer.

340
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,031
How generous of you.

341
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,111
Thank you very much.

342
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,710
After me.

343
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,197
Benny Parker, LAPD.

344
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,193
Seems I'm not the only one
ignoring you.

345
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,000
Perhaps you're just not
that interesting, Detective.

346
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,876
Benny?

347
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,157
Benny.

348
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,871
Well, talk about a dead end.

349
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,552
"Axara's art celebrates life.
I tarnished it with death.

350
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,599
"I have no right
to stay in her world.

351
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,632
"I lived for Axara.

352
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,719
"Now I die for her.

353
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,191
Benny."

354
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,596
Wow.

355
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,076
I hope that no one ever
loves me that much.

356
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,232
So, did the M.E. confirm
that it's suicide?

357
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,760
Still running
the autopsy report,

358
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,394
but the bottle
of sleeping pills

359
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,114
found in his hand,
half empty.

360
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,597
Right. And factor in Benny's VIP pass,
which means he had access.

361
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,517
Yeah, it means that Benny

362
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,120
had tons of time
and opportunity

363
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,680
to plant the firework
that killed Jill.

364
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,990
A textbook post-murder
guilt-driven suicide.

365
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,953
A little too textbook
if you ask me.

366
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,913
Oh, look
what just arrived.

367
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,077
Who wants a T-shirt?
Here you go.

368
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,359
- And, oh, one for you.
- Nice.

369
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,472
One for you.

370
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,156
Definitely for you.

371
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,992
What you can't fix,
decorate, am I right?

372
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,917
Ah!

373
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:09,877
Miss Lopez.

374
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,673
Aw.

375
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,071
What is all this?

376
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,437
Axara swag.

377
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,034
Thank you gifts for
solving the case.

378
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,680
Apparently, she'd have
come in person,

379
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,836
but she's busy rehearsing

380
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,594
for her rescheduled show
at the Bowl.

381
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,473
Well, technically,
the case isn't closed

382
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,797
- till we get the final autopsy report.
- Exactly.

383
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,316
And until then,
it's LAPD jurisdiction.

384
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,431
Which means no shows.

385
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,154
Well, I'm afraid
you'll have to take it up

386
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,953
with the police commissioner
'cause apparently,

387
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,516
he and Axara are poker buddies,
it's all been sorted.

388
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,479
Oh, hello.

389
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,677
An Axara bobblehead.

390
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,039
Who's deserving
of this little, uh...

391
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,797
Ah! My good friend,

392
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,193
Mr. Janitor.

393
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,800
That should cheer you up.

394
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,994
I think you'll be very proud.

395
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,199
I forced myself
to speak to a coworker who

396
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,754
has terrible breath.

397
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,390
It was probably only
for a few minutes,

398
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,398
but it seemed
like a decade.

399
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,278
Hello, I'm trying
to compliment my... you.

400
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,594
Clearly, something is
on your mind.

401
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,479
Come on, I'm all ears.

402
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,036
I am so sorry.

403
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,675
Um, but you're paying me
to listen, so...

404
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,918
Well, yes. But the whole reason
that I'm here

405
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,794
is to learn to be less
self-centered.

406
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,834
Okay, um...

407
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,877
Okay, fine.

408
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,512
Um, I'm, I'm just having
a wee bit of a conflict

409
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,757
with a, with a friend of mine.

410
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,799
Conflict? My specialty.

411
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,877
Mediating... conflict, I mean.

412
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,397
Let me help you.

413
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,030
Uh, that's very nice.

414
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,356
It's a very nice offer, but...

415
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,792
I know. And it feels
so strange. It's...

416
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,032
I feel so good,
it's like I'm floating.

417
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,277
Although that might...

418
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,993
might be the three gimlets
I had at lunch.

419
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,955
So, yes?

420
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,352
Uh...

421
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,353
Oh, my God. Chloe.

422
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,200
Okay, so you know
how you thought

423
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,874
Axara's superfan's "suicide"

424
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,474
was a little too
neatly wrapped up?

425
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,318
Mm-hmm.

426
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,398
You just won the super

427
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,034
totally right hunch
of the millennia award.

428
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,272
- So Benny's not our guy?
- No.

429
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,439
Benny died the day before
that firework exploded.

430
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,150
So Benny is not our killer.

431
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,919
He's our first murder victim.

432
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,198
So Benny's suicide was staged
before the attack at the Bowl.

433
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,710
Yeah. A frame job to cover up
the real killer's tracks

434
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,838
which means major
pre-meditation.

435
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,157
And that Axara's still
in serious danger.

436
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,237
The killer's still out there.

437
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,112
Exactly.

438
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,710
This month's winner is...

439
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,595
Pauline.

440
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,638
And I think we can
all agree that Pauline

441
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,071
deserves her place
in the spotlight

442
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,550
far more than others.

443
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,916
So if you'd all like to

444
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,033
raise a glass,
if you have one, to Pauline.

445
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,074
Lucifer knows
she's a temp, right?

446
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,916
- Yeah, just tell him to meet me in the car.
- Yeah.

447
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,479
I don't know exactly what
you're going through,

448
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,557
but I've been there.

449
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,634
That very stool,
actually.

450
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,149
Have you, Espinoza?

451
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,833
You know, talking about it
might help.

452
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,316
You know,
really opening up to someone.

453
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,318
I mean, that's what...
that's what I did.

454
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,952
And now everything's
coming up Dan.

455
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,399
No, seriously, man,
I'm happy.

456
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,438
You know, I'm-I'm ready
to start dating.

457
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,239
Hell, you and I
are even friends.

458
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,231
Friendlier.

459
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,794
I guess I could try.

460
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,271
Lay it on me.

461
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,750
I'm here for you, bro.

462
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,475
It's just life, you know?

463
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,951
It's like this eternal wasteland
of meaningless existence.

464
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,154
a dark void staring
down at you

465
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,031
like a beaten dog scrounging
on the side of the road,

466
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,755
just waiting to get mowed down
by the next tsunami of crap.

467
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,190
Wow.

468
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,271
Hmm.

469
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,232
Maybe we all are just
dust in the wind.

470
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,320
I am not cancelling my show.

471
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,273
Well, it turns out
that your troubled fan

472
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,437
was framed
for Jill's murder.

473
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,076
So, with the killer
still out there,

474
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,600
I can't let you perform
tomorrow night.

475
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,269
Detective, if I hid under a rock
every time there was an issue,

476
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,880
I'd still be doing bar mitzvahs.

477
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,912
Also, you'd be under
a rock. Most unpleasant.

478
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,118
Okay.

479
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,231
Detective.

480
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,713
Now, I say we let
Pinhead sing.

481
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,671
I mean, after all,
some people

482
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,439
are just destined
to be in the spotlight.

483
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,319
Others not. Like
you, for example.

484
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,550
So not helping.

485
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,069
You know, maybe you
should wait in the car.

486
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,760
You know what?
Maybe you should both go.

487
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,235
I assure you, I'm fine.

488
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,715
Detective, what are you doing?!

489
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,797
This is...

490
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,434
no time for heroics.

491
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,791
Not that I care.

492
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,597
Building searched.
All clear.

493
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,280
You poor, poor dear.

494
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,119
Can I get you something?
Some tea?

495
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,879
More face needles,
perhaps?

496
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,197
Uh, I'm fine, your partner's
actually the one with the medic.

497
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,072
Who?

498
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,311
Oh, her.

499
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,000
No, that's, uh,
that's just a scratch.

500
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,077
No, it's you

501
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,555
that I'm focused on.

502
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,556
Okay, great.
Thank you.

503
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,833
Okay, so I have your
security team in place.

504
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,400
For tomorrow's show, right?

505
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,671
Smart to beef things up.

506
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,871
Yeah, I don't think
you understand.

507
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,831
There's no show.

508
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,116
While you're in danger,
you're under

509
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,636
24-hour LAPD protection,
led by me.

510
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,832
- That's ridiculous.
- Agreed.

511
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,030
She's a terrible choice.

512
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,557
I'll do it.

513
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,560
Look what we found
in the laundry chute.

514
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,513
I'm gonna head back to the
homestead to expedite ballistics.

515
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,995
- You want to come?
- Excellent plan.

516
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,316
Why don't you go
with Miss Lopez,

517
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,115
and I will keep <i>you</i> safe,

518
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,356
you little gem.

519
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,597
So you're gonna be my bodyguard?

520
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,556
Are you even a real cop?

521
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,917
Consultant, actually.
But I can assure you

522
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,952
that my penthouse
has top-notch security.

523
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,193
And every other amenity
you could possibly desire.

524
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,671
Hmm.

525
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,076
We'll see.

526
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,637
Come on, girls.

527
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,397
What a treasure.

528
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,034
Okay,

529
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,840
the only reason I'm agreeing
to this is hiding Axara

530
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,430
at your penthouse is
an unpredictable choice.

531
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,832
But, listen, if there's
even the slightest hint

532
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,394
that she is unsafe,

533
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,750
your duties are revoked.

534
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,070
Right.

535
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:37,952
What?

536
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,759
Just, you said "duties."

537
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,516
Come on.

538
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,516
Bravo, Miss Axara.

539
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,877
Yes, I adore
your shaky groove thing.

540
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,833
And I'm sure
my custom

541
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,793
- Italian leather settee does, too.
- sorry,

542
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,911
I need to rehearse.

543
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,310
Right, yes, of course.
Of course.

544
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,795
Whatever you need.

545
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,515
- Help me.
- Right, uh, chaps,

546
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,836
why don't you, um...

547
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,277
you wait downstairs.

548
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,470
I've got this.

549
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,955
- Thank you, Rob.
- Bob.

550
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,560
Bob. Bob, yes.

551
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,629
Now, please tell me,

552
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,153
how can I better focus
my attention on you?

553
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,714
Mm...

554
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,431
Maybe you can
make yourself useful.

555
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,909
Unless that's just a prop.

556
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,476
Prop? Please.

557
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,156
Mozart, Liberace, Elton.

558
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,194
- Who?
- All the greats were my pupils.

559
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,000
But none as bright as you,
of course.

560
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,033
Whatever.

561
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,596
Right.

562
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,551
"C."

563
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,594
Voice of an angel.

564
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,355
God, it would be if your A-flat
wasn't out of tune.

565
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,199
I beg your pardon?

566
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,750
Perhaps it's you who's...

567
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,000
whose perfect pitch

568
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,759
allows you to hear
what others...

569
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,030
...cannot.

570
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,878
- Um...
- Hmm.

571
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,400
You know what, never mind.

572
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,517
I need a break anyway.

573
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,069
Is this my smoothie stuff?

574
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,432
Yes. Yes, but,
uh, please,

575
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,600
allow me to shower you with
my culinary expertise.

576
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,356
Right.

577
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,516
W-Wait, are...
No, no, no.

578
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,949
Aren't you gonna
wash them first?

579
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,953
Rinse off all the nutrients?
Don't be silly.

580
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,513
Uh...
Hold on.

581
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,559
Wh-Where's my
fresh turmeric?

582
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,114
You can't make it
without the right ingredients.

583
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,231
I couldn't agree more.

584
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,313
Just-just stop.
Just let me do it.

585
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,920
- Please, forget it.
- I will...

586
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,077
- You don't even know what you're doing.
- ...you don't want to...

587
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,192
...do this, Miss Axara!

588
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,312
You've got
to be kidding me.

589
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,230
<i>Everyone loves Axara.</i>

590
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,474
What kind of psycho
would want to gun her down

591
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,915
in cold blood like that?

592
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:02,992
It's you.

593
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,520
- What?
- The gun

594
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,915
that we found
at the Roosevelt,

595
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,193
turns out that it's
registered to you.

596
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,354
Oh, this is insane.

597
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,677
I mean, that looks like my gun.

598
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,678
I keep it in the tour bus
for protection.

599
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,832
- But someone must've stolen it.
- We also uncovered

600
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,714
the insurance policy
that you took out on Axara.

601
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,680
Apparently, if anything
happens to her,

602
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,075
you get a huge chunk of change.

603
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,714
Is that also insane?

604
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,996
First of all,

605
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,789
I would die if anything happened
to that girl.

606
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,392
Secondly, all managers have
insurance policies like that.

607
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,432
But, trust me,

608
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,756
the payout is nothing compared

609
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,917
to managing an entire career.

610
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,511
Why would I kill the goose
for one egg?

611
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,160
I don't know. Maybe the goose

612
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,760
is a pain
in the ass.

613
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,110
Okay.

614
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,433
Unless you got something
else to say, I'm leaving.

615
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,274
I do have something
else to say.

616
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,755
You're under arrest
for the murder

617
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,236
of Jill Murray,
Benny Parker,

618
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,080
and the attempted murder
of Axara.

619
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,357
No!

620
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,311
Wait.

621
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,156
We will start
by stating our grievances.

622
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,157
Who would like
to go first?

623
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,476
She lied and
betrayed me.

624
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,511
Next.

625
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,996
Brave start, Mazikeen.

626
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,472
And you,

627
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,796
- Doctor?
- Well,

628
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,354
no grievances.

629
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,358
Um, Maze is right.

630
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,199
I hid the truth,
which was

631
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,754
a betrayal of our friendship.

632
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,355
And if I could take
it all back, I would.

633
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,871
But I can't.

634
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,676
So, all I can do is say...

635
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,510
I'm sorry.

636
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,833
And I miss you, Maze.

637
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,638
Thank you,

638
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,309
Doctor.
That was really heartfelt.

639
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,791
And now is there
anything that...

640
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,912
you'd like to apologize for,
Mazikeen?

641
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,231
She just said she boned my ex.

642
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,311
I didn't do
anything.

643
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,069
Well, it always takes two
to tango.

644
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,839
Yeah, Linda and Amenadiel.

645
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,395
One, two, naked tango.

646
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,000
Me, screwed.

647
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,873
Resolving conflict
means,

648
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,278
uh, accepting culpability
on both sides.

649
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,517
If you don't let
all the icky feelings out,

650
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,752
things tend to fester,

651
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,679
and turn gangrenous,
and, well...

652
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,040
nobody likes losing a limb.

653
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,236
Not true.

654
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,550
And I didn't do crap.

655
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,713
She called dibs.

656
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,830
On someone she doesn't
even have feelings for.

657
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,918
I'm a demon, Linda.

658
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,871
What do you expect?

659
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,834
You can't admit to a
single thing you did wrong?

660
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,190
I've done a lot of things wrong.

661
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,470
Like, a lot.

662
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,520
But at least I don't claim
to be the good one.

663
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,191
Pretend to stand
on some moral high ground.

664
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,716
You know, despite all
the books you've read,

665
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,474
all the degrees on your wall,

666
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,717
you forgot the one
rule that matters.

667
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,434
Hos before bros.

668
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,120
Well, it's pretty
tricky to follow that rule

669
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,119
when you seem to have slept
with, oh, half of Los Angeles.

670
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,749
And yet,
you begrudge me

671
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,713
the one man I've cared about

672
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,513
in a really
long time.

673
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,312
And yet,

674
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,120
I still gave him up.

675
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,871
That's how much I care
about our friendship.

676
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,233
Go... to... hell.

677
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,511
Okay. Great start.

678
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,030
Um, all part
of the process.

679
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,914
Good time for a breather?

680
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,190
We're done.

681
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,316
Okay.

682
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,316
What on earth
do you think you're doing?

683
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,199
You. Get naked.

684
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,669
I beg your pardon?

685
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,475
You said you wanted to focus
your attention on me.

686
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,393
Well, yes, but, uh...

687
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,671
And I always have sex
the night before a show.

688
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,473
It... it calms me.

689
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,593
Well, I'm sorry, but you'd have
to tie me down with steel chains

690
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,631
to have sex with you.

691
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,035
I'd be up for that.

692
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,516
No! What... it wasn't
a suggestion!

693
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,439
Demanding. I like it.

694
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,551
- Miss Axara.
- Uh-huh?

695
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,672
- I love sex.
- What a coincidence. Me, too.

696
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,389
But, and this may be a first...

697
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,317
Okay.

698
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,910
I'm really not in the mood.

699
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,031
You know what?

700
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,316
I don't think you like me.

701
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,311
Really?

702
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,678
Whatever gave you
that impression?

703
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,475
But... but everybody likes me.

704
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,909
Apart from the person
who tried to rocket you

705
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,032
- into a bloody red glare.
- Okay.

706
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,799
If you don't like me,
why were you so hell-bent

707
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,917
on being my bodyguard?

708
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,473
Because I'm trying
to take my focus off

709
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,000
someone very dear to me.

710
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,194
But... a friend, actually.

711
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,232
Well, no, indeed,
more a coworker.

712
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,190
Oh.

713
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,152
The detective
you work with?

714
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,477
How did you...

715
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,315
I may be a self-centered diva,
but I have eyes.

716
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,070
Why are you trying
to convince yourself

717
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,077
that you don't like her?

718
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,714
I'm not trying to convince my...

719
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,360
It's not me
I'm trying to convince.

720
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,750
It's my Father.

721
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,599
I defied Him,

722
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,714
and He's big on that
"eye for an eye" sort of thing.

723
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,671
So I'm afraid that he's gonna
come after...

724
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,039
the things that I care about
the most.

725
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,953
Well, you're a cop, sort of.

726
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,755
Get a restraining order
or something.

727
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,440
Well, I'm afraid
it's not that simple.

728
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,869
Dad's all-powerful.

729
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,031
Works in government?

730
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,515
Mm, rules the universe.

731
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,200
Frickin' politicians.

732
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,751
Well, hey, if it helps,
I know how you feel.

733
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,390
After what happened at my show,
it seems like everyone's trying

734
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,751
to take away the thing
I care about the most.

735
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,360
What? Fresh turmeric?

736
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,879
Funny. Funny, but no.

737
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,396
Music.

738
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,752
Ah.

739
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,917
But here's the deal.

740
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,789
You can't let anyone
come in between you

741
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,154
and the things you're passionate
about in this life.

742
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,117
Or it ain't worth living.

743
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,553
Well. Thank you,
my self-centered diva,

744
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,717
for your counsel.

745
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,320
It's duly noted.

746
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,756
Hey, I don't know
about you,

747
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,758
but I could use a drink.

748
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,351
Oh, well now you are
talking my language.

749
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,479
As long as it's not orange, right?

750
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,795
Right.

751
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,676
Lovely.

752
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,357
I wasn't sure if you're
a single malt girl...

753
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,158
Bugger.

754
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,432
Epic toxicology report.

755
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,070
It turns out the manager
didn't just kill Benny,

756
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,754
he tortured him, too.

757
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,354
I mean, it's bad enough
that he made him take

758
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,710
all those sleeping pills,
but to force him

759
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,990
to eat all that stuff, too?

760
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,754
I mean, that is just cruel, man.

761
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,076
Wait, so what does
this mean here?

762
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,509
Oh, right, sorry, yeah.

763
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,074
It's the chemical compounds.

764
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,756
So first, he fed Benny
raw turmeric.

765
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,190
- Hmm.
- And kale.

766
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,510
A lot of kale.

767
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,394
And then, a boatload
of spirulina.

768
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,671
But this all sounds
like ingredients for a smoothie.

769
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,075
Yeah, smoothie of death.

770
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,077
No, I mean,
the pills.

771
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,600
It could have been
blended into a smoothie

772
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,075
like the one that Axara drinks.

773
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,794
Be a good way
to disguise the taste.

774
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,032
You know what? I don't think
the manager's the killer.

775
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,591
Beard-to-misery quotient.

776
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,236
It's a science, man.

777
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:14,230
After my divorce,
I went for the old Walter White.

778
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,399
Whatever you do,
do not go full Hagrid.

779
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,955
Kenny Rogers, tops.

780
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,720
Oh, hey, uh,
a buddy of mine's here.

781
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,997
He's a real "glass half full"
kind of guy.

782
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,631
He actually pulled me out
of a dark spot once.

783
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,518
Hey.

784
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,433
Hey.

785
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,919
Maybe he can help you out.

786
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,270
Amenadiel.

787
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,431
Pierce.

788
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,112
Or not.

789
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,470
Uh, since you guys

790
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,997
obviously already
know each other,

791
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,793
how about I just give you
some time to catch up? Hmm?

792
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,431
Yeah, I saw a food truck

793
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,552
on the way in. I'm just gonna
grab myself a burger.

794
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,956
Protein style.

795
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,556
Something... Yeah. Okay.

796
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,035
I'm gonna be back later.

797
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,877
I can't allow you
to defy my father

798
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,759
or drag my brother
into one of your schemes

799
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,753
to remove your mark.
This ends now.

800
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,677
Okay.

801
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,080
- Really?
- Yeah.

802
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,430
Look, I'm way ahead of you.

803
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,069
I got my hopes up

804
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,237
thinking that Decker
was the key, and then Lucifer.

805
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,840
But that's what
the Sinnerman thought.

806
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,430
Then I thought resurrecting
Abel could end my curse.

807
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,951
But I made a mistake.

808
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,640
I was wrong.

809
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,156
'Cause here I am,
alive and well.

810
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,273
Well, alive and miserable,
actually.

811
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,797
So I'm done.

812
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,670
<i>Finito.</i>

813
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,510
I quit.

814
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,870
You happy?

815
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,271
Yes.

816
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,398
Yes,

817
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,670
because this means I did it.

818
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,077
I destroyed your alliance
with Lucifer.

819
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,794
I prevented you
from defying my father.

820
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,440
I passed my test.

821
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,154
If you passed your test,

822
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,280
why don't you have
your wings back?

823
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,631
Well, maybe my test
has multiple parts.

824
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,394
Um, if so, that's okay.

825
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,397
It's God's will.

826
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,636
- Right?
- How do you do that?

827
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,314
How do you stay so positive?

828
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,193
It's called faith, Pierce.

829
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,754
See, I spent a lot of time
doubting myself,

830
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,872
but now I realize
that it's about the journey,

831
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,395
not the destination.

832
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,711
How could you possibly have
any faith or hope

833
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,071
when you're in a loop
of endless suffering?

834
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,511
- Isn't she supposed to be on lockdown?
- Uh...

835
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,116
- I'm calling Chloe.
- No! No, I mean,

836
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,390
no need to get the
detective involved.

837
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,430
I've got this.

838
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,477
Go back upstairs.

839
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,114
You're in danger.

840
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,353
Give me the microphone.
Give me the microphone.

841
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,034
Go on, now, go.

842
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,273
Did you think I'd crumble?
Hmm?

843
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,832
Give me the microphone.

844
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,320
See?

845
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,550
How could I
ever leave this?

846
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,554
No one's ever gonna scare
me out of the spotlight.

847
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,077
Ever.

848
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,999
Yeah? Try me.
Come on.

849
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,437
You.

850
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,192
You were supposed
to keep her safe.

851
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,594
No offense, darling, but
you're the one with a knife.

852
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,510
What's with
the knife, Cece?

853
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,870
You're gonna hurt someone.

854
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,275
Does it even matter?

855
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,437
Two people are dead,
you were shot at,

856
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,876
and you still won't stop.

857
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,439
Don't you see the danger
you're in?

858
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,315
Again, am I the only one
who sees the irony here?

859
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,597
You said you would take a break
after the L.A. shows

860
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,393
and then you added Asia
and Europe to the tour.

861
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,630
That's two more years.

862
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,876
- So?
- So?!

863
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,435
That's two more years now.

864
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,994
And then another two
and another two.

865
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:01,917
When does it end?

866
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,310
Never.

867
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,637
Hopefully.

868
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,879
I am tired of sharing you,
Axara.

869
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,910
Remember high school?

870
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,318
Before all of this.

871
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,673
It was just you and me,
singing along to Beyoncé.

872
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,195
Well, you would sing,

873
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,472
I-I would just watch
and eat cookie dough.

874
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,556
I want that.

875
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,432
You have to know by now.

876
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,160
I love you.

877
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,671
Love me?

878
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,712
Oh, my God, Cece,
what did you do?

879
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,513
She was trying to protect you.

880
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,554
Force you out of the spotlight
by any means necessary.

881
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,518
Even murder?

882
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,393
I-I didn't know what else to do.

883
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,557
You almost killed me.
How is that protecting me?

884
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,080
She was never trying
to kill you.

885
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,350
Oh, what is she doing here?

886
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,550
Cece ran
your social media.

887
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,070
It was easy for her
to start an account as you

888
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,760
and access all of
your private texts.

889
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,559
So you knew about
the choreography switch.

890
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,071
I just wanted to scare you.

891
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,112
I'm never gonna stop singing,
Cece.

892
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,989
Not even for me?

893
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,233
My music means more to me
than anything.

894
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,754
You have to know that by now.

895
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,759
Drop the knife,
Cece, it's over.

896
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,236
No.

897
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,358
No!

898
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,960
No!

899
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,757
I just wanted her
to be safe.

900
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,276
I know you did.

901
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,234
Well, who's the heroic one, now?

902
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,437
- What?
- Oh, my God. Lucifer, are you okay?

903
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,240
Why wouldn't I be okay?

904
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:49,917
Oh.

905
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,839
Oh, God, whatever you do,
don't pull it...

906
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,872
...out!

907
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,396
Oops.

908
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,357
What were you thinking,

909
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,392
tackling somebody with a knife?

910
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,871
It's not me I was worried about,
Detective.

911
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,749
Lucifer.

912
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,200
You see, it's like
I was saying, Pierce.

913
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,594
You got to have faith
because life can surprise you.

914
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,716
Now, if my brother,

915
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,679
the Devil, can have that...

916
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,950
Maybe I can, too.

917
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,877
God.

918
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,670
Hey, look at you, buddy.

919
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,713
Seems like someone's
feeling better.

920
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,470
Okay.

921
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,356
Hi.

922
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,318
Lieutenant.

923
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,839
Congratulations
on another solve.

924
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,830
Thank you.

925
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,514
Thanks, I appreciate that.

926
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,440
I'm just glad
Axara's okay.

927
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,996
Well, I guess more than okay,
her show's back on for tonight

928
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,399
and she sent me two VIP tickets
to say thank you.

929
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,511
Well, you deserve them.

930
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,677
So, who are you taking?

931
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,073
Oh, I don't know, I was just...

932
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,111
I thought you'd never ask.

933
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,310
Oh.

934
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,557
Yeah.

935
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,989
Sure. Yeah, why not?

936
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,038
- Great, I'll see you later.
- Okay.

937
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,515
Morning, Detective.

938
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,234
- What?
- What?

939
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,591
You sure you don't want
to throw a surprise party

940
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,598
for the guy in evidence lockup?

941
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,238
Ah, right, yes, I suppose
I deserve that.

942
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,275
No, no, I am back
to status quo.

943
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,076
- Hmm.
- Since I realized,

944
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,040
ultimately, I can't control you

945
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,594
or the world around you,
for that matter.

946
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,559
So there's no point
trying to extinguish

947
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,632
the proverbial spotlight,
is there?

948
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,715
I may just have to take a knife
to the chest every now and then.

949
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,274
Right.

950
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,750
Hello.

951
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,200
Tickets for Axara's
show. Tonight?

952
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,877
Excellent.

953
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,309
Right, what time
shall I pick you up?

954
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,190
Um...

955
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,637
Well...

956
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,634
it didn't seem like you
were that interested

957
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,956
in hanging out
with me lately,

958
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,590
so Pierce and I
are gonna go together.

959
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,476
Oh. Right, yeah, of course.

960
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,558
Of course. Well...

961
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,511
have fun.

962
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,313
I've heard she's amazing live.

963
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,232
Uh...

964
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,992
I think I've made
a horrible mistake.
