00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,838
<i>Previously, on</i> Lucifer...

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,111
Someone is forcing
those wings on me.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,834
I'm sure it's all a part
of God's plan.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,394
If you mean His plan
to continually

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,512
manipulate and control
me, then agreed.

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,280
I really appreciate how
you handled the whole

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,756
"me not wanting you and
Amenadiel to bone" thing.

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,395
I do really like you.

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,876
You can't die, I know.
But I promise you,

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,270
I will find a way to end

11
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,516
<i>your infinite misery</i>

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,359
<i>if it's the last thing I do.</i>

13
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,639
Thank you for your help, Maze.

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,076
No worries.
This actually gives me time

15
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,556
to brainstorm a little problem
of my own.

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:34,992
Aah!

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,113
<i>I don't understand.
How does this not work?</i>

18
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,674
You still have no idea
how to kill me.

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,439
Lucifer, I'm here.

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,916
Are you ready?

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,876
Lucifer?

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,392
Why is it so dark in here?

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,671
Wha...?

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,591
Lucifer?

25
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,229
Lucifer?

26
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,632
Detective.

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,633
There's been a change of plan.
I'm not going.

28
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,878
What? But we have a case.

29
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,834
Something's happened.
Please leave.

30
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,077
Wait, what's happened?
Are you okay?

31
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,598
I can't...

32
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,473
I can't make them go away.

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,520
Wha...?

34
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,236
Lucifer,

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,957
- what's on your back?
- Detective,

36
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,152
I said leave!

37
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,517
What's going on?

38
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,360
I can't...

39
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,352
I can't control them.

40
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,029
No! Detective!

41
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,356
Detective!

42
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,158
Detective, grab my hand!

43
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,517
Detective!

44
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,150
No!

45
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,235
No...

46
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,950
No!

47
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,034
And then I woke up.

48
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,872
And it's not the sort
of dream I'm used to.

49
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,434
A lot less nudity.

50
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,877
So what do you think
it means?

51
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,070
Well, I think it's
pretty obvious

52
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,430
what it means, Lucifer.

53
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,275
That I need sturdier
guardrails?

54
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,711
Or, maybe there's some
symbolism in there.

55
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,434
- You mean my wings, don't you?
- Yes.

56
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,996
- Well, clearly, you have issues.
- Well, you would, too,

57
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,709
if your father slapped
a pair on your back.

58
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,074
Took away your Devil face,
took away who you are.

59
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,472
I mean, who knows what else
He'll take from me.

60
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,999
Lux? My...
job with the LAPD?

61
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,510
Or Chloe.

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,277
Well, she may be part of it,
but this isn't about her.

63
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,709
This is about me.

64
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,715
So can we please just focus
on what truly matters here?

65
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,953
- Which is?
- Showing my Father

66
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,799
that He can't control me.

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,753
And He's not as powerful
as he thinks.

68
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,440
And how are you going
to do that?

69
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,835
By defying Him.

70
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,517
I'm gonna remove
Pierce's immortal curse

71
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,870
so he can finally die.

72
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,513
There's just
one problem, though.

73
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,672
Just one?

74
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,917
Everything
that I've come up with,

75
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,594
Pierce has already tried.

76
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,914
I'm completely out of ideas.

77
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,431
My well is dry,
and that is why I'm here.

78
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,557
Yeah, well.

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,640
Not sure I know how to remove
an immortal's curse.

80
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,916
No.

81
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,715
I need you to remove
my mental block.

82
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,799
Hypnotize me, or something.

83
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,272
I hear it works with smoking
and insomnia, so...

84
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,311
Unfortunately, that's not
how it works, Lucifer.

85
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,315
There's no easy fix
for a lack of ideas.

86
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,029
- No?
- No.

87
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,834
You just have
to be patient.

88
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,637
You never know when or where
inspiration will strike.

89
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,639
Well, thank you,
Doctor.

90
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,916
For being completely
unhelpful today.

91
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,471
Ah.

92
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,629
Hi, Amenadiel.

93
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,917
Hey, Ella?

94
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,392
Um...

95
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,671
Uh, listen, about tonight?

96
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,837
- I'm gonna have to...
- No!

97
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,751
No.

98
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,679
You better not
be cancelling on me again.

99
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,678
I know,
I'm so sorry.

100
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,951
It's just,
I have so much work to do.

101
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,872
Can't you play hooky?

102
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,671
Not if I want to be
a responsible adult.

103
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,950
Right.

104
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,435
But...

105
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,080
What if...

106
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,280
you <i>weren't</i> a responsible adult?

107
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,554
Just this once.

108
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,269
Come on!

109
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,916
Chloe,

110
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,510
I mean, don't you ever miss
just having stupid fun

111
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,591
like when you were a kid?

112
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,231
I was a pretty grown-up kid,
actually.

113
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,791
Well, never too late to start.

114
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,560
I know.
I'm sorry, babe, I can't.

115
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,597
Can we do a neon party
rain check?

116
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,234
Decker, one of these days,

117
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,273
you're gonna realize
what you've been missing.

118
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,434
It looked
so cute on you.

119
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,074
This is the longest you've
ever gone without talking.

120
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,915
Ever. Is something
on your mind?

121
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,111
Nothing.

122
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,676
That's the problem.

123
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,870
Uh, how so?

124
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,033
Well, I...

125
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,233
I have this puzzle
that I need to solve,

126
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,675
but I've hit a mental block.

127
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,115
- Okay.
- Have you ever just

128
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,432
ran out of ideas when working
a particularly difficult case?

129
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,313
I mean, before I came along,
of course.

130
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,795
Right.

131
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,114
Um... not really.

132
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,438
I-I mean, I've hit dead ends
from lack of evidence,

133
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,599
but no, because there's always
a new angle to consider.

134
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:03,957
Braggart.

135
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,479
Our victim's name was
Kathleen Pike, 33.

136
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,870
She's the author
of a best-selling

137
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,120
futuristic Y.A. series
called <i>Class of 3001.</i>

138
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,640
She was found
with her head bashed in

139
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,479
by her own
vintage typewriter.

140
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,716
The irony's a little
on the nose.

141
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,240
Or on the head, should I say?

142
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,790
What's that white stuff?

143
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,549
I know what you
guys are thinking.

144
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,274
She's a synthetic.

145
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,631
<i>Aliens.</i>

146
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,071
The android who bled white.

147
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,153
No one? Really?
Oh, never mind.

148
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,919
That's melted ice cream, anyway.

149
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,112
It looks like our victim was
about to dig in last night

150
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,471
when someone showed up
and rewrote her dessert menu

151
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,000
with that typewriter.

152
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,472
Real wound's
over here though.

153
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,071
Huh. Who found the body?

154
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,396
Kathleen's editor.
Vincent Green.

155
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,596
He's out by the pool.

156
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,871
Thank you.

157
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,676
Uh, Daniel.

158
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,438
- Your head is mostly empty.
- Huh?

159
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,435
Exactly. And yet, you manage
to do this improv thing.

160
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,199
How do you come up with stuff
on the spot like that?

161
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,352
Well, the first rule of improv
is "yes, and..."

162
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,233
Yes and what?

163
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,555
That's the name
of the technique.

164
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,080
Right. I've heard you talk
about it before,

165
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,600
but I don't actually understand
what it means.

166
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,516
Well, you agree with whatever's
being said... yes.

167
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,117
And then you say the first thing
that comes to your mind... and.

168
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,999
That makes no sense.

169
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,677
But I'm desperate,
so I'll try anything.

170
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,350
Yes, and.

171
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,392
<i>I got the call
from Kathleen late last night.</i>

172
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,910
She finally finished
the new book.

173
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,874
We made plans for me
to come over this morning,

174
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,070
pick up the manuscript.

175
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,158
Do you usually pick up
manuscripts in person?

176
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,590
With Kathleen, yes.

177
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,029
There's only ever
one hard copy

178
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,152
since she does all her writing
on that typewriter.

179
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,959
Yes, and... well, her dying

180
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,594
on that typewriter as well,
it seems.

181
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,393
Do you know anyone who
would have done this to her?

182
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,513
- Any known enemies?
- No, Kathleen was extremely well-liked.

183
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,712
She had millions
of devoted fans.

184
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,310
Ugh, I know how fans can get
obsessed with their idols.

185
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,318
Yes, and... with their boobs.

186
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,113
Like after you did <i>Hot Tub High School,</i> Detective.

187
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,040
- Oh. Uh-huh.
- You don't think this could be my fault, do you?

188
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,550
- Why?
- I was so excited that she was finished

189
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,194
that I tweeted the news
to her fans.

190
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,357
I really talked the book up,
hinting at this huge

191
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,075
action-packed robot rebellion
ending she teased me with.

192
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,237
Well, as long as you didn't
tweet her address as well.

193
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,079
No, of course not,
but someone could find that.

194
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,760
Someone who wanted to
read the book first?

195
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,838
Yes, and... someone who wanted
to tell her

196
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,509
that robot rebellions couldn't
be more dull and derivative.

197
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,234
What is with all this
"yes, and" stuff?

198
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,914
Oh, just some improv thing
I was hoping

199
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,839
would knock me out
of my idea dry spell.

200
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,191
But you're literally just saying
what you would normally say,

201
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,274
with the words "yes, and"
in front of it.

202
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,756
Yes, and...
it's clearly not working.

203
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,394
- Uh-uh.
- Stupid Daniel.

204
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,829
Idea dry spell.

205
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,871
Just like Kathleen.

206
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,031
What do you mean?

207
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,755
She had the worst case of
writer's block I've ever seen.

208
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,477
Took her five years to figure
out how to end the series.

209
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,957
Well, never mind that.
How did she cure her block?

210
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,790
I don't know, she said I would
understand after I read it.

211
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,878
Said she even explained
how she broke through it

212
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,230
in the book's afterword.

213
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,510
But you haven't read it.

214
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,796
No, like I said,
there's only one copy

215
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,956
and I haven't seen it.

216
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,116
Detective.

217
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,035
This afterword
could explain how

218
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,913
to overcome my own form
of writer's block.

219
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,432
- What?
- We need to find it.

220
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,791
The killer. You mean we need
to find the killer.

221
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,798
Exactly. So they can
hand over that book.

222
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,395
Mmm. Linda, I have to say,

223
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,196
these last few weeks have been
absolutely incredible.

224
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,431
Wow.

225
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,590
You're really good at this
sweet, sappy stuff, aren't you?

226
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,795
I feel the same.

227
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,990
Good.

228
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,511
Well, maybe someday

229
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,359
we can actually have
this date in public?

230
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,232
I do hate
sneaking around, but Maze.

231
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,030
I know. I know.
She can't find out.

232
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,157
I...

233
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,792
I want to tell her,
I just don't know how.

234
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,393
I admit, I'm afraid.

235
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,273
Well, you should be.
Maze would...

236
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,880
not take this well.

237
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,158
I feel so guilty, I...

238
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,153
I've been avoiding
her calls.

239
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,396
Are we being cowards?

240
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,829
Yes.

241
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,396
But, Linda, it's...

242
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,472
- Maze.
- Maze. I know.

243
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,836
Do you know how she's doing?

244
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,840
I'm sure she's fine.

245
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,839
Busy hunting bounties and all.

246
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,590
But...

247
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,514
I can check on her if that'll
make you feel better.

248
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,189
Really? Just to make sure
she's okay.

249
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,311
Of course.

250
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,279
I would do anything for you.

251
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,518
What? Is that too sappy?

252
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,718
"Max was plagued with confusion.

253
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,992
"If Jessica truly loved him,
then why'd she kiss Tristan?

254
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,673
"And in the back seat
of her flying car, no less."

255
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,876
This has sold
millions of copies.

256
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,834
Tongueless kissing and stealing
liquor from their parents.

257
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,874
I mean,
where's the sex? The drugs?

258
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,676
That robot rebellion
cannot come soon enough.

259
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,034
Was your high school experience
this pathetically PG?

260
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,757
I didn't have much of
a high school experience.

261
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,118
Oh! Played hooky
a lot did you?

262
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,151
Suddenly I like you more.

263
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,750
No, child actors don't have
much time for regular school.

264
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,719
You're either
auditioning or on set,

265
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,520
- so it's mostly tutors.
- Ah.

266
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,793
Maybe I did
miss out on a lot.

267
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,910
Anyhow, why are you
reading those?

268
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,951
I doubt that that's gonna

269
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,037
lead us to
Kathleen's killer.

270
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,833
Oh, well, Kathleen's
afterword explained

271
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,235
how she overcame
her writer's block.

272
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,511
In order to understand,
I may need context.

273
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,234
Oh, in case she uses examples?

274
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,115
Exactly.
So, speaking of the killer,

275
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,231
any leads?

276
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,990
Yeah, actually.

277
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,193
Someone who goes by
the name of

278
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,875
"Ashley3001fan."

279
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,357
Got into some pretty heated
online arguments with Kathleen.

280
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,755
Apparently,
she wasn't too happy

281
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,679
the book was taking
so long to be completed.

282
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,317
Poor Kathleen. When will people
understand writer's block

283
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,590
is a very serious condition?

284
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,029
Well, Kathleen agreed.

285
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,230
"I don't
have to answer

286
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,476
"to ignorant trolls
like you.

287
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,591
"There's a reason
I'm the writer

288
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,910
"and you're a fan.

289
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,951
"Maybe you should try
contributing

290
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,514
something to society."

291
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,989
Ouch, nicely put, Kathleen.

292
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,476
Yeah. After Kathleen
publicly berated her,

293
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,949
Ashley went completely offline.

294
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,629
You think Ashley
was so humiliated by her hero

295
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,751
that she wanted revenge?

296
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,595
It's possible.

297
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,310
Well, let's hope so 'cause
I need to find that boo...

298
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,640
Killer, the b... killer.

299
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,996
I know you mean book.

300
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:40,952
I did.

301
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,516
Hi, Amenadiel.

302
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,634
Hey, Trixie.
Uh, is Maze here?

303
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,793
Sorry, no.

304
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,037
Oh.

305
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,637
Would you mind telling her
that I stopped by, please?

306
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,117
Sure.

307
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,070
Thanks.

308
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,594
Nice work, Trix.

309
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,119
Why don't you
want to see him?

310
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,356
Amenadiel's nice.

311
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,757
Nice?

312
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,680
If he were nice,

313
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,600
he wouldn't be sneaking around
behind my back with my friend,

314
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,075
and lying about it.

315
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,476
Why are they
doing that?

316
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,512
I don't know.
'Cause they suck.

317
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,473
Mommy says that sometimes,

318
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,717
people are just scared
to tell the truth.

319
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,160
Maybe they need a little help.

320
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,639
That's not a bad idea, kid.

321
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,914
Helping people tell the truth
is kind of my thing.

322
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,077
Huh.

323
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,035
I cybertraced
Ashley3001fan to here.

324
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,674
And the ice cream
from the crime scene,

325
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,916
also from here.

326
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,197
- Ashley could be one of these three.
- Yes.

327
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,557
They do seem like
the insipid Y.A. type.

328
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,195
Though, scooping frozen treats
for others day in, day out,

329
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,669
seems even more boring.

330
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,360
Yeah, but they get to
hang out with their friends.

331
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,960
There's no
adult responsibility.

332
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,350
It looks like
they're having fun.

333
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,239
You know, stupid fun.

334
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,238
Since when do you
like "stupid fun"?

335
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,232
Hi.

336
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,512
Detective Decker, LAPD.
I'd like to ask you all some...

337
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,229
- Freeze.
- Ha.

338
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,715
"Freeze,"
good one.

339
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,236
Please.

340
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,510
Please don't call my mom.

341
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,394
I-It's just one joint.

342
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,752
Claire?
What's going on?

343
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,317
Claire?

344
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,076
You're not Ashley?

345
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,229
No, I'm Ashley.

346
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,029
Ashley's a man?

347
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,756
Yeah, I'm a man.

348
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,039
And I'm the manager.
What's going on?

349
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,720
Oh, what's
going on, Ashley,

350
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,354
is you need to
give me that book.

351
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,960
Otherwise, I'll show you
the true meaning of

352
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,594
"you scream for ice cream."

353
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,591
Okay?

354
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,156
All right.

355
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,598
<i>I'm gonna
ask you nicely, Ashley.</i>

356
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,910
<i>Where's the book?</i>

357
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,313
Dude, I'm telling you.
I don't have any book.

358
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,952
Then why was that found
at Kathleen Pike's home?

359
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,440
"3000 and Yum."

360
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,912
Yeah, that's a flavor I created
special for Kathleen.

361
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,634
I brought it to her house
personally.

362
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,877
Do you always bring ice cream
to your murder victims?

363
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,476
Murder?

364
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,277
Wait...

365
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,435
Kathleen's dead?

366
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,471
Very.

367
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,360
Man, she was the greatest
writer of our generation.

368
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,277
What?

369
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,114
Her books were about
high school drama.

370
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,154
What could a man of your age
possibly find great about them?

371
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,791
I mean, high school
was the best time of my life.

372
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,950
Reading <i>3001</i> makes me
feel like I'm 16 again.

373
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,318
Those books are deeper
than you think.

374
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,790
We know about your online fight
with Kathleen.

375
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,315
Things got very heated.

376
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,159
Must've hurt to have her
insult you like that

377
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,476
in front of everybody.

378
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,949
I never should've
said those things.

379
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,480
So, I sent her
some of my writing.

380
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,000
You know, like an olive branch.

381
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,554
Hold on, you're a writer?

382
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,910
Yeah, man.
I've written, like,

383
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,515
tons of <i>Class of 3001</i>
fan fiction.

384
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,672
Can't imagine that Kathleen
was too pleased.

385
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,719
Kathleen liked my writing.

386
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,231
She even asked me to help her
finish her last book.

387
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,193
She asked you to help?

388
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,518
So Kathleen's solution to
writer's block was to outsource?

389
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,359
Yeah, but when Kathleen
read my version,

390
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,916
she decided she wanted to go
in a different direction.

391
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,473
But she said it did help her
f-finish her book on her own.

392
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,034
So... boom.

393
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,799
It did? How?

394
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,995
What exactly helped Kathleen
overcome her block?

395
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,037
She told me she realized
she needed to be more authentic.

396
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,550
You know, get back
to her original inspiration.

397
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,840
That is completely meaningless.

398
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,556
Well, well, what was
the original inspiration?

399
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,392
Oh? You guys don't know?

400
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,831
So, the characters in Kathleen's
books are based on real people.

401
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,474
And all of her
stories were taken

402
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,796
from her real life
at Westside High,

403
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,956
right here in L.A.

404
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,757
Max, Jessica, Isabel.

405
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,832
She didn't even change
any of the first names.

406
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,356
Did she have any
original ideas at all?

407
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,710
Well, she changed
the last names.

408
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,076
And she did
have to come up

409
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,509
with all that
futuristic sci-fi stuff.

410
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,797
I mean, trust me,
that is not easy.

411
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,076
I'm actually writing
my own book

412
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,396
about a forensic
scientist

413
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,233
- who talks to ghosts.
- You are? Tell me,

414
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,920
what do you do when
you run out of ideas?

415
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,191
Oh, I never run out of ideas.
I've got way too many.

416
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,800
My problem is how to choose.

417
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,070
Well, there's no need
to rub it in.

418
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,953
- Thank you.
- So, this author exposed

419
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,435
all these people's
dirty laundry?

420
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,630
Sounds like motive to me.

421
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,115
Uh, I think Charlotte...

422
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,314
uh, Ms. Richards is right.

423
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,591
If, uh, someone saw
the editor's tweet

424
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,996
announcing another book, then
maybe one of them killed her

425
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,469
to make sure it
didn't come out.

426
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,037
Ella.

427
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,590
The main characters
from the <i>Class of 3001...</i>

428
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,440
if the book's gonna reveal
any secrets, it's theirs.

429
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,960
These are our suspects.

430
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,631
Right. Prom king,
sexpot, cheerleader,

431
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,759
bad boy, valedictorian, jock.

432
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,270
One of these six degenerates has
my book. Let's bring them in.

433
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,279
No, all you have is speculation.
Not enough for arrest warrants.

434
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,279
I mean, even if we did
bring them all in,

435
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,715
we don't have any leverage.
Why would they

436
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,831
admit to anything?

437
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,474
Well, according
to superfan Ashley,

438
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,114
Kathleen was rushing to get
her book done in time

439
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,476
to announce it
at her high school reunion,

440
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,636
which is tomorrow night.

441
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,151
Well, if all our suspects
are in town to attend,

442
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,917
gave them opportunity.

443
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,471
Mm-hmm. And it gives us
an opportunity as well,

444
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,431
to go undercover.

445
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,313
- Well, good. What are we waiting for?
- Well,

446
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,477
it's a high school reunion.
Everybody knows everybody.

447
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,400
Unless...
you're Todd Cornwell.

448
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,116
Who's Todd Cornwell?

449
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,631
Exactly. Todd Cornwell.

450
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,394
Class loner, acne,

451
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,636
Coke-bottle glasses,
whole bit.

452
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,234
Went to college overseas,

453
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,716
and when I stalked Kathleen's
classmates online,

454
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,674
Todd was the only one with
zero social media presence.

455
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,236
Lucifer, you could go as Todd.

456
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,317
Yeah, no, no, seriously.
Look, he looks just like you.

457
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,119
Has all that
masturbation finally caught up

458
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,151
with your eyesight,
Daniel?

459
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,800
No one'll believe that
even if I tell them

460
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,719
I've had a face
and body transplant.

461
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,360
Yeah, but it
might be our only shot.

462
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,596
I mean, I could go
as your plus-one.

463
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,990
Oh, poops. Hold up.

464
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,159
Todd RSVP'd "yes."

465
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,518
Charlotte,
is there any legal way

466
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,676
to prevent him from attending?

467
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,914
Well, it's definitely
not legal

468
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,191
to distract Todd with,
say, a bounty hunter.

469
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,232
If anyone needs me,
I'm gonna be in my office

470
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,510
not hearing the plan.

471
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,113
Okay, great.
Are you gonna call Maze?

472
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,313
Gladly, whilst you
research our suspects.

473
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,797
Enjoy.

474
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,636
Maze.

475
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,710
I'm so glad you're here.

476
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,515
Yeah, well,
you seem pretty busy.

477
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,395
I called a couple of times.
Never heard back.

478
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,799
Yeah, I know, work's been crazy.

479
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,040
Oh. I was hoping that maybe
you found a boyfriend.

480
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,191
- Boyfriend?
- Yeah.

481
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,392
Why would I...

482
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,830
Definitely no boyfriend.

483
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,517
- Really?
- Yup.

484
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,031
So single. So... so single.

485
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,038
Well, in that case,
I should totally set you up.

486
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,836
I have just the guy.

487
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,356
Oh, that it so thoughtful
of you, Maze,

488
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,552
but you really don't
have to do that.

489
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,316
Please, Linda, I want to.
What are best friends for?

490
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,398
I know, it's just me
and blind dates...

491
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,869
- How about tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow night?

492
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,831
Mm.

493
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,552
Oh... shoot. I think I'm busy.

494
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,436
Let me do this.

495
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,956
Tomorrow it is.

496
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,590
No.

497
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,395
Mom?

498
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,752
Baby, what are you doing up?
Get back in bed.

499
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,952
Bed? It's morning.

500
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,035
I'm gonna miss the bus.

501
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,915
What?
I've-I've, uh...

502
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,474
I've been up all night?

503
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,077
Come on, come on.
Get the...

504
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,190
Get-get, go, get your...
Where's the...?

505
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,436
Oh.

506
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,950
Wow.

507
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,999
You know, high school reunion's
a very popular torture in Hell.

508
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,118
This is beautiful.

509
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,200
I... you know, you didn't
even try to look like Todd.

510
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,720
Well...
well, why would I do that?

511
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,474
If I was Todd, I'd
want to look like me.

512
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,478
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh, look.

513
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,110
It's Emily and Bo,
Tristan and Jessica,

514
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,118
and there's Max talking
to Isabel.

515
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,437
She is so not
good enough for him, really.

516
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,512
What did you just say?

517
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,510
Max and Isabel,
two of our suspects.

518
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,710
Oh, oh!

519
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,509
The prom king
and the sexpot.

520
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,949
Oh, Lucifer, don't judge.

521
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,675
There's so much more
to these people

522
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,950
than their stereotypes suggest.

523
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,031
Right.

524
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,191
It's just, ugh.

525
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,550
Are you being serious?

526
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,832
Yeah. Yeah, the books
are much deeper

527
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:53,797
than you'd imagine.

528
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,829
The characters, they're so
compelling and relatable

529
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,673
and rich, and I-I mean...

530
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,149
They're all here.

531
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,919
And one of them
is most likely a killer.

532
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,512
Right.

533
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,876
- Right.
- Right.

534
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,270
Okay, I'm gonna go
sign us in

535
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,517
so that we can
finally meet the, um...

536
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,913
so we can
question the suspects.

537
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,156
What is happening?

538
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,479
Okay, so we each have
three people to question.

539
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,955
Let's figure out
who was worried about

540
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,560
Kathleen's book coming out.

541
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,672
Yes, and where everyone was
the night of the murder.

542
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,030
Oh, yeah.

543
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,757
- Are you even listening to me?
- Mm-hmm.

544
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,675
Do you know,
I can't believe I'm saying this,

545
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,190
but focus, Detective.
I need that afterword.

546
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,754
- Right, sorry.
- Right.

547
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,036
- Oh, my God.
- What?

548
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,511
It's Jessica.

549
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,071
Can you believe

550
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,999
that sophomore year,
she hooked up with Tristan

551
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,238
on the laserball field?

552
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,469
Don't worry,
Jessica's on my list.

553
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,758
Okay, so,
I'm the first one here.

554
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,311
I'll just go have a drink
at the bar.

555
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,789
- Sure thing.
- Linda.

556
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,795
Amenadiel,
what are you doing here?

557
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,434
Well, Maze invited me.

558
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,757
I thought she wanted to talk
after I stopped by yesterday.

559
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,111
Maze is setting me up
on a blind date.

560
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,874
What if you are my blind date?

561
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,309
Well, that doesn't make
any sense.

562
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,910
Unless she knows about us
and is trying to make us squirm.

563
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,039
And torture
is her thing.

564
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,431
Linda,

565
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,676
this is Todd.

566
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:22,877
Your date.

567
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,717
Hello.

568
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,314
This is a blue lobelia.

569
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,151
Native Americans use them
to treat constipation.

570
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,751
Thank you.

571
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,397
But what are you two doing here?

572
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,751
Double date.

573
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,275
Isn't this great?

574
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,870
Hmm.

575
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,597
Yeah, uh, no...

576
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,038
Hi.

577
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,516
Great.

578
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,714
Excuse us. Isabel.

579
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,591
Todd?

580
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,830
Odd-bod Todd?

581
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,712
Are...

582
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,516
I'm sorry. You...

583
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,192
just look so different.

584
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,470
I'll take that as a compliment.

585
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,710
Wow, I...

586
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,475
Do you have a British accent?

587
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,393
Well, I've had many accents
over the years,

588
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,994
but this one is clearly
the best.

589
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,077
You're so funny and... so hot.

590
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,078
- I know.
- Mmm.

591
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,920
Uh, but I need
to ask you a few questions.

592
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,952
Sure. Let's catch up.

593
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,797
Can you believe Kathleen's
coming out with another book?

594
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,514
Oh, I believe it.

595
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,189
That bitch loved
profiting off of us.

596
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,800
Ugh, she sucks.

597
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,035
But honestly, we're all, uh,
just trying to move on.

598
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,232
Man, those books ruined
our lives.

599
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,870
I had to move to Maine.

600
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,309
Do you know
what was in her last book?

601
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,034
What sparked her final idea?

602
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,794
The books
<i>are</i> about you, correct?

603
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,350
- Oh, for...
<i>- So, do you know</i>

604
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,750
<i>what happens in the new book?</i>

605
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,235
Are there any big secrets

606
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,317
that come out or...

607
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,559
Does Isabel actually
get pregnant?

608
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,592
Uh, who are you again?

609
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,870
What were you doing
two nights ago?

610
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,912
I was... at home?

611
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,076
Doing a facial.

612
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,390
I was with Tristan.

613
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,077
I think.

614
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,558
I mean, by the time I flew in,
it was really late.

615
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,830
You're hiding something.

616
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,796
And I think I know what.

617
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,595
It's because
you were with Bo,

618
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,234
and you didn't want Isabel
to find out.

619
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,999
But, like, who cares
what Isabel thinks?

620
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,715
Especially after what she did
to you in chemistry class?

621
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,191
I mean, do you realize you're
still lucky to have your hand?

622
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,039
<i>It doesn't matter
where I was two nights ago.</i>

623
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,111
What matters is that tonight,
we're together.

624
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,559
So where were you
two nights ago?

625
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,039
Let's go talk somewhere
a little quieter.

626
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,030
Right.

627
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,515
Yeah, talk. Uh-huh.

628
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,079
You two have so
much in common.

629
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,232
Yeah.

630
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,596
Linda, you're a therapist.

631
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,675
And, Todd,
you're in therapy.

632
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:57,957
Discuss.

633
00:25:59,240 --> 00:25:59,832
Oh.

634
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,394
- You don't have to...
- I wet the bed.

635
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,438
It's more common
than people think.

636
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,990
You're lovely.

637
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,510
I'm so glad she convinced me
to skip my reunion for this.

638
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,557
Most serial killers wet the bed.

639
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,272
I smell a love
connection, don't you?

640
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,198
Let's crank this
date up a notch.

641
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,552
Waiter.

642
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,317
Linda.

643
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,034
This is getting out of control.

644
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,437
We just have to get through
tonight. We can do it.

645
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,437
So, Todd.

646
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,670
Any hobbies?

647
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,992
I make my own toothpaste.

648
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,399
Where were you two nights ago?

649
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,911
Uh...

650
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,276
Come on, Tristan.

651
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,630
I can't remember.

652
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,275
Well, try.

653
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,954
I told you, man,

654
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,514
I don't, I don't remember
where I was.

655
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,518
Oh!

656
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,072
Tell me the truth now.

657
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,953
Okay.
A couple nights ago,

658
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,640
we all broke into
the school pool.

659
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,076
You know, just a little party
before the party, you know?

660
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,316
Well, why is that a secret?

661
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,671
Because we didn't
invite everyone.

662
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,633
Well, you, for instance.

663
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,674
- What?
- I'm sorry, man.

664
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,234
If we knew how cool
you had gotten,

665
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,834
we totally would've
invited you.

666
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,114
So what you're saying is
you all have the same alibi?

667
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,795
Wasting our time here.

668
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,480
Where's the detective?

669
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,280
I dig you, Chloe.

670
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,439
You...
you're different.

671
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,872
Too bad you didn't go
to high school with us.

672
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,431
Yeah.

673
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,036
That would have been great.

674
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,350
Yeah.

675
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:38,040
So, you were gonna tell me

676
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,715
where you were two nights ago?

677
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,630
Is that really what you want
to talk about, hmm?

678
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,960
Well, I mean,

679
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,880
I would really like to know.

680
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,236
Max!

681
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,833
What are you doing? Who is that?

682
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,599
- Uh...
- We were talking.

683
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,035
And what do you care?

684
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,876
You cheated on Max
with Tristan.

685
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,960
That was 15 years ago.

686
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,035
- Actually, I am still kind of pissed...
- Right.

687
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,078
- ...about that.
- I'm sorry I cheated on you,

688
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,237
but I only did it because
I thought you slept with Emily.

689
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,240
I would never
cheat on you, Jessica.

690
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,950
I know that now.

691
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,920
I read <i>3001.</i>

692
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,073
It showed me how much
you really loved me.

693
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,590
- Hmm.
- You know, sometimes I think about

694
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,350
getting back together.

695
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,557
Mmm.

696
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,320
- Me, too.
- Oh.

697
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,120
What's
going on here?

698
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,750
Max, I thought it
was gonna be just us.

699
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,320
I'm not really down
for a four-way.

700
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,789
Make that five.

701
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,276
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I'm not down, either.

702
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,232
- Oh. So you were sleeping with Emily...
- Oh.

703
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,597
...weren't you? And then you
bring this rando in here, too?

704
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,597
- I'm not a "rando."
- I-I just met

705
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,029
- this rando.
- We are never...

706
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,396
- Hey.
- ...getting back together.

707
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,590
- You didn't tell her about us?
- Jessica, I...

708
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,950
- this rando...
- Us? - Yes, us.

709
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,350
- That's what you said.
- I never said...

710
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,755
- Oh, really, Max?
- ...anything like that to you.

711
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,714
Detective! None of these people
killed Kathleen.

712
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,713
- What?
- "Killed"?

713
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,030
- What?
- "Detective"?

714
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,435
I have discovered
that they all

715
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,710
have the same alibi.

716
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,314
They broke onto
the campus two nights ago

717
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,510
and had a party
by the pool.

718
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,830
Didn't you? Hmm?

719
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,437
So, Kathleen's killer, not here.

720
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,034
Look at me,
being the responsible one.

721
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,118
So that's why you were
all acting so strangely.

722
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,516
Yeah.

723
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,518
Sorry we didn't invite
you, Todd, but, uh...

724
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,677
you're not mad, right?

725
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,950
You were hanging out
with Kathleen anyway.

726
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,991
What?

727
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,917
Todd was hanging out

728
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,554
with Kathleen two nights ago?

729
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,114
Yeah, it's what he said
in the e-mail.

730
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,999
I did? I...

731
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,475
What? He was an
awesome math tutor,

732
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,830
and now he helps me
with my taxes.

733
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,156
Detective.

734
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,795
I think I'm the killer.

735
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,672
Apparently, Maze took Todd
to a steakhouse in Hollywood.

736
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,316
It is an odd place
for a kidnapping, even for Maze.

737
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,797
And what motive would Todd have
to kill Kathleen?

738
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,117
- He's not even in the books.
- Well, exactly.

739
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,755
Odd-bod Todd's probably tired
of being left out.

740
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,280
Oh, right, should have
thought of that.

741
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,954
Yes, you should have,

742
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,516
but someone was making the case
all about themselves.

743
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,350
Slightly unprofessional,
but I forgive you, Detective.

744
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,472
I know. I can't believe
I let myself

745
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,239
get so wrapped up
in all of that.

746
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,436
Think I was just trying
to make up

747
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,758
for all the fun, teenage drama
that I missed out on, you know?

748
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,599
I didn't even get to go
to my own prom.

749
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,393
It's ridiculous, I know.

750
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,750
No, it's not.

751
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,994
And that's the best way
to clean out an abscessed tooth.

752
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,237
How delightful.

753
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,238
I am so glad we did this.

754
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,194
I have missed you guys.

755
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,159
I mean...

756
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,679
what's not
to miss, right?

757
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,637
Mmm.

758
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,716
- Mmm.
- Okay, stop.

759
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,076
Uh,
that's inappropriate.

760
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,231
We're in a restaurant, Maze.

761
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,596
Who cares?

762
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,519
I care. I mean, I'm just...

763
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,757
it ju... it just makes me
uncomfortable.

764
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,030
Oh, it does?

765
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,792
Well, does this make you
uncomfortable, too?

766
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,390
Maze!

767
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,273
Maze! Why are you
acting like this?

768
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,834
Because she knows.

769
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,434
You know, don't you?

770
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,955
And you're torturing us.

771
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,954
That is so incredibly mean.

772
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,719
I'm the one who's mean?

773
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,036
You're the ones who've been
running around,

774
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,630
lying to me about this fling
for weeks.

775
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,513
Of course we lied, Maze.
Look at you.

776
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,040
You have a tendency
to overreact.

777
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,674
I do not...

778
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,075
- overreact.
- Maze.

779
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,078
- Can we just calm down here?
- No!

780
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,877
No.

781
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,950
I will not take orders from
some pathetic daddy's boy.

782
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,272
Tell me,
Amenadiel.

783
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,678
Is this the divine purpose
your Father sent you here for?

784
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,794
So you can bang
some... selfish human?

785
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,918
Selfish? Selfish?

786
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,035
All I do
is listen to your problems!

787
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,390
Everyone's problems!

788
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,832
So, yeah, for once,
I put myself first

789
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,952
and did what makes <i>me</i> happy.

790
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,356
So, sue me. Or torture me.
Or better yet,

791
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,876
why don't you just skewer me
with one of your knives?

792
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,674
But before you do,

793
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,150
know that this wasn't
some fling,

794
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,478
that what Amenadiel
and I found

795
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,320
was completely unexpected,

796
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,837
but 100% real.

797
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,880
But you were my friend.

798
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,356
Maze?

799
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,077
LAPD, drop
the weapons.

800
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,674
Yes, I indeed visited Kathleen
two nights ago.

801
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,030
The night she was murdered.

802
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,475
Kathleen was murdered?

803
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,190
Oh, my.

804
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,679
And y-you think I did it.

805
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,632
Of course you do.

806
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,237
The weirdo.

807
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,870
The outcast.

808
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,230
I'm used to people
judging this book by its cover.

809
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,511
That's why I swore off
social media.

810
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,879
I still don't even know
how Kathleen tracked me down.

811
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,755
Kathleen tracked <i>zou</i> down?

812
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,437
She wanted to discuss

813
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,637
the final installment
of her series with me.

814
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,035
Well, why would she talk
about that with you?

815
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,276
You're not even
in the books.

816
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,239
Yeah. I was surprised, too.

817
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,749
Turns out, not only was
she going to include me

818
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,871
in the final book,

819
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,074
she was making me the hero.

820
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,676
Wait, h-hold on, does that mean
she let you read the book?

821
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,269
Uh, no.

822
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,914
She didn't want me
to read it yet.

823
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,113
Kathleen was waiting
for the reunion.

824
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,756
She was excited
about finishing it in time

825
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,757
to show everyone there.

826
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,236
So you have no idea
what's in the afterword?

827
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,272
The afterword? No.

828
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,197
But she did tell me
about the story itself.

829
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,237
How it had
a peaceful, grounded ending.

830
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,956
No scandals,
no insiders versus outcasts.

831
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:58,991
Just...

832
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,595
people finally understanding
each other.

833
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,040
The way
she described it, it...

834
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,799
...it sounded beautiful.

835
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,798
- And boring.
- And not at all like

836
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,754
the action-packed robot ending
that the editor told us about.

837
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,314
I smell a new theory brewing.

838
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,194
I got to go make a phone call.

839
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,791
<i>Mr. Green.</i>

840
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,476
Hi, uh,
Detective Decker, LAPD.

841
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,830
Detective, how can I help you?

842
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,154
Um, I was just wondering,
did Kathleen ever talk to you

843
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,317
about working
with a ghostwriter?

844
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,354
A ghostwriter? No, wish she had.

845
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,194
Maybe she would have finished
the book sooner.

846
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,510
Oh, I see.

847
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,993
So-so, she never mentioned
a-a fan-fic writer

848
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,520
named Ashley Collins?

849
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,632
He's a-a manager
at an ice cream shop.

850
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,399
I think the name's
Scoop Science.

851
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,233
Actually, yeah,
Kathleen did mention some sort

852
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,040
of overeager fan who invented
some special flavor for her.

853
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,634
Kind of creeped her out.

854
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,550
Wh-Why are you asking?
Is this Ashley a suspect?

855
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,674
Oh, well, I can't divulge any of
that information at this time.

856
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,190
But you've been
incredibly helpful, Mr. Green.

857
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,390
Thank you.

858
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,634
You in the mood
for some ice cream?

859
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,032
Hello, Vincent.

860
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,520
Looking for Ashley?
Sorry to disappoint.

861
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,479
- What are you doing here?
- Drop the gun.

862
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,238
You're under arrest
for the murder of Kathleen Pike.

863
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,039
You lied to us, Vincent.

864
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,760
I called Ashley.
He confirmed

865
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,355
that the robot ending was
his version and not Kathleen's.

866
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,552
- Th-That means nothing.
- But it is suspicious.

867
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,160
So I looked at traffic footage.

868
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,113
You went to Kathleen's house
the night of the murder.

869
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,471
But, Detective, didn't
he tell us he didn't go

870
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,034
over there
till the next morning?

871
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,313
Fine. Yes,
I was at Kathleen's that night.

872
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,390
If you had waited five years
for that damn book like I did,

873
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,399
you wouldn't want to wait
another second for it either.

874
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,080
But once you got it,
you didn't like what you read,

875
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,919
- did you?
- I was horrified.

876
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,760
She ended the series
in the most boring way possible.

877
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,553
And you were worried
about the sales.

878
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,591
We'd lose millions

879
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,598
without the right ending.
Ashley's.

880
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,917
So you and Kathleen argued
over which one to use.

881
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,913
She refused to use
the good version.

882
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,313
So, yeah, I threw
her stupid typewriter at her.

883
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,159
But even with Kathleen gone,
you knew

884
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,676
that you couldn't publish
Ashley's ending as hers.

885
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,031
So you came here
to tie up the one loose end.

886
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,919
Now, tell me, Vincent...

887
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,280
Kathleen's manuscript,

888
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,238
where is it?

889
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,396
I don't have it.

890
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,477
I destroyed it.

891
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,995
You did what?

892
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,120
I couldn't let anybody read
that pathetic joke of an ending!

893
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,276
But I needed to read
the afterword

894
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,994
so I could fix my problem,

895
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,395
- and now you're saying it's gone?!
- Lucifer,

896
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,556
back off.

897
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,677
What did it say?

898
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,280
- The afterword?
- Yes!

899
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,711
How did she fix her block?

900
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,593
I don't know!
She said inspiration came

901
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,711
when she realized
she couldn't go back

902
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,910
and change what she'd done.

903
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,349
Well, that doesn't
help me at all!

904
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,590
Lucifer, stop!

905
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,280
Now I'm never gonna
figure out how to...

906
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,840
Are you okay?

907
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,440
No, Detective.

908
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,714
Far from it.

909
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,879
Remind me to never go on
another blind date ever again.

910
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,712
Mm-mm. Oh, I don't know,

911
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,515
I thought you and Todd
really made a connection.

912
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,635
Okay, so I've been thinking.

913
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,399
- Yeah.
- A lot.

914
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,314
Pretty crazy what Maze did.

915
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,596
I'll say.

916
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,830
But she was right.

917
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,318
We never should have lied
to her.

918
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,557
And I never should have lied
to myself.

919
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,230
Yourself?

920
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,396
What do you mean?

921
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,078
As much as I tried
to tell myself otherwise,

922
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,517
I knew what we were doing
was going to hurt her.

923
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,479
And I did it anyway.

924
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,231
That's how much I wanted
to be with you, Amenadiel.

925
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,954
Look, you've made me happier
than I've been

926
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,311
in a long, long time.

927
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,391
But...

928
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,473
I <i>was</i> being selfish.

929
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,796
Maze is my friend.

930
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,159
I can't be with you anymore.

931
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,719
Not when it does this to her.

932
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,071
You know, it's not fair for her
to take this away from us.

933
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,159
I know. I don't expect you
to understand.

934
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,718
But I don't want to be
that kind of person.

935
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,714
It's just not who I am.

936
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,190
Actually, I do understand.

937
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,317
Um...

938
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,752
I may have strayed
from who I am as well.

939
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,717
So I guess this is it.

940
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,117
I guess so.

941
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,876
Lucifer!

942
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,197
I'm here.

943
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,720
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes,

944
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,274
I wanted to check on you.

945
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,598
That you were back to being
the good detective.

946
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,113
"The good detective"?

947
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,232
Mm. Well, I like
our partnership much better

948
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,120
when you do all the work and
I'm the fun, irresponsible one.

949
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,880
Oh. Yeah.

950
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,640
- I did get a little carried away at that reunion.
- Hmm.

951
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,717
Just a smidge.

952
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,519
Y-You know,
it made me realize something.

953
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,116
All of that high school
drama that I missed out on...

954
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,358
the-the girly gossip,

955
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,313
the hallway crushes,

956
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,193
all those school dances...

957
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,157
that's just not who I am. I...

958
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,474
I like being
the responsible adult.

959
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,270
Right.

960
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,196
So you no longer desire any
of that high school poppycock?

961
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,640
No.

962
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,040
Well then...

963
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,640
I guess
you won't be wanting this.

964
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,757
Detective...

965
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,234
...will you go to the prom
with me?

966
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,757
I can't believe you did this.

967
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,869
Thank you, Lucifer.

968
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,240
I'm just glad you got
what you needed.

969
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,794
But you, you never found
that inspiration

970
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,559
that you were looking for.

971
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,040
Are you ever gonna tell me what
it is you were trying to solve?

972
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,031
Uh, it's-it's complicated.

973
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,433
Well, tell me anyhow?

974
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,870
Very well.

975
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,995
A long time ago,

976
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,750
dear old Dad put a curse on a...

977
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,715
well, a friend of mine.

978
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,472
And I want to break that curse,

979
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,236
show my Father He's not
as powerful as He thinks,

980
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,079
that He can't control him.

981
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:04,872
Or me.

982
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,791
Well, crazy metaphor aside,

983
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,599
can I offer some advice?

984
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,519
Oh...
please.

985
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,120
If I've learned anything
from this experience,

986
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,040
it's that it's better
to move forward

987
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,754
than stay stuck in the past.

988
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,751
It's just like Kathleen
realized.

989
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,160
We can't rewrite history.

990
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,680
You can't.

991
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,590
But maybe I can.

992
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,076
Detective, you're a genius.

993
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,071
Thanks?

994
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,720
You've just given me my idea.

995
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,314
All I need to do is go back

996
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,115
and undo the reason it exists
in the first place.

997
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,116
Oh.

998
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:45,798
Thank you.
