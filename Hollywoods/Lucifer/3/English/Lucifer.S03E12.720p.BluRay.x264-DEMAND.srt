1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,117
<i>- Previously on</i> Lucifer...
<i>- I figured out that you're</i>

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,595
<i>the one who grabbed
the Sinnerman.</i>

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,519
- I told you, I did this for us.
- For us.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,791
I had your back on this,
and for whatever reason,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,878
<i>you still felt the need
to go behind mine.</i>

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,993
I just read the crime scene
report, and holy burrito bowl!

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,879
Lopez, just stop talking!

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,999
<i>It was weird</i>

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,436
seeing you and Amenadiel
so chummy.

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,677
I don't want you two
getting together.

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,791
<i>I understand.</i>

12
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,316
I can see why Lucifer's
so affected by you.

13
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,000
It's because you're
special, Decker.

14
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,476
<i>What if the Sinnerman</i>

15
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,439
was the one working
for someone else?

16
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,678
<i>The world's first murderer,
marked by God</i>

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,112
and doomed to walk the Earth
alone for a tortured eternity.

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,040
<i>It's quite the moniker.
Wouldn't you agree, Cain?</i>

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,397
Thanks for the drink.

20
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,479
Figured it's the least
I could do.

21
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,955
After all, I am the reason

22
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,919
you're leaking
all over my floor.

23
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,032
Well, gosh, we have so much
to catch up on, don't we, Cain?

24
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,637
Or would you
prefer Mr. Cain?

25
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,597
Make it sound official?

26
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,196
Let's just stick with Pierce.

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,271
Very well.

28
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,392
Why all the games, Pierce?

29
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,114
- No games.
- Oh, really?

30
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,360
Now you'll claim your arrival

31
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,029
- on my doorstep's simply coincidence?
- No.

32
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,232
I'm the one that had you knocked
out and left in the desert.

33
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,191
- I see.
- That's all I did.

34
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,478
So you're gonna blame everything
else on your eyeless stooge?

35
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,712
He wasn't a stooge.
He was my right-hand man.

36
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,070
Until you shot him dead.

37
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,357
Excellent way to repay
his loyalty, by the way.

38
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,630
He went rogue.

39
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,354
I have no idea
why he did what he did.

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,279
That's why I had
to take him out.

41
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,876
You know, for an immortal,

42
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,960
you really do bleed a lot,
don't you?

43
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,911
Yeah.

44
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm still human.
I still feel

45
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,112
all the pain that
comes with death.

46
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,109
It's just the wounds heal.

47
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,358
- Oh, sounds like a bitch.
- Yeah, well, I don't have to tell you

48
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,677
what sort of sick sense of humor
your father has.

49
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,318
Which is why I'm surprised
that you're working with Him.

50
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,673
Well, there's no sense
in denying it now.

51
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,192
I know

52
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,432
you gave me back
my wretched wings.

53
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,996
I know you took
my devil face.

54
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,394
So tell me, what did
He offer you in return?

55
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,760
I would never work
for your father.

56
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,155
And I had nothing to do with
your wings or your devil face.

57
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,550
I don't believe you.

58
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,830
I don't care.

59
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,995
Now, after getting stabbed

60
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,112
and killing the closest thing
I had to a friend,

61
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,640
I've had a long day.

62
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,231
Where do you think
you're going?

63
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,273
You can't just
walk out on me.

64
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,911
Or what?
You'll kill me?

65
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,319
I'll tell everyone
who you really are!

66
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,516
Go ahead.

67
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,913
They don't even believe
you're the Devil.

68
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,552
Maze, what the hell was that?

69
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,075
Testing a new blade.

70
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,673
Making sure
it's kill ready.

71
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,917
It is.

72
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,440
Maze, you can't just throw
knives at Trixie's door.

73
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,960
It's dangerous, and
now we have to pay

74
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,117
- to have this fixed.
- Relax.

75
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,436
I got it covered.

76
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,790
Trixie's already working on

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,320
another one of
her alien drawings.

78
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,555
Is that why you've been putting
up all of Trixie's artwork?

79
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,359
- To cover up the damage?
- What?

80
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,114
Kid's got to make cash somehow.

81
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,949
Seriously, Maze?

82
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,994
You live in a house with people.

83
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,433
Is it too much to ask for
just a little consideration?

84
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,757
This is that human thing

85
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,076
where you're mad about
something else

86
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,913
but you're taking it out
on me, right?

87
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,996
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to snap at you.

88
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,113
I'm just, I'm-I'm upset about
what happened with Lucifer.

89
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:55,958
Ah.

90
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,231
After everything he did...
betraying me,

91
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,352
kidnapping a prisoner
right under my nose...

92
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,153
he hasn't even apologized yet.

93
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,159
And?

94
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,317
And what? It's not funny.

95
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,955
I trusted him enough
to break the rules with him.

96
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,034
He didn't care
what happened to me.

97
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,192
All right.

98
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,360
Look, you're upset.

99
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,916
I get it.

100
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,160
But you have to
understand, Chloe,

101
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,392
you're never gonna
change Lucifer.

102
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,799
He is who he is.

103
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,911
Yeah.

104
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,471
I-It was so dark,

105
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,711
we couldn't see anything.

106
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,997
I thought it was just stupid
kids goofing around again.

107
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,316
These transients

108
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,360
keep coming through here
to get to our beach.

109
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,876
We can't stop them.

110
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,959
We put up signs,
but they just ignored them.

111
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,640
And now they're
committing murder.

112
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,399
I mean, what kind of monster
would do this?

113
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,235
That's what we're
gonna figure out.

114
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,196
Excuse me, please.

115
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,120
Hey, morning.

116
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,476
What do we got?

117
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,552
Uh, a male vic,
24 years old,

118
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,274
known as Manny
"The Moondog" Taylor.

119
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,231
Moondog?

120
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,635
Yeah, he's
a pro surfer.

121
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,991
Top of the circuit three
out of the last five years.

122
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,318
And, man, if you only saw what
this kid could do.

123
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,273
Wait a minute.
Are you surfing again?

124
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,913
Uh, I'm trying to get in
the water before work

125
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,998
as much as possible,
but you know how it is.

126
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,913
Yeah, only so many hours.

127
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,436
Yeah, that, and I'd never be
as good as this kid was.

128
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,911
So, blunt force trauma

129
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,634
to the head is
cause of death, Ella?

130
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,638
Nope.

131
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,911
No? Okay. Then what is?

132
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,677
Choking.

133
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,115
Like on a chicken bone?

134
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,155
Or did someone else do it
with their hands, or...?

135
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,916
Surf leash.

136
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,270
From his own board?

137
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,677
Not his own board.
No DNA.

138
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,357
Ella.

139
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,391
Are you okay?

140
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,711
Uh-huh.

141
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,837
- Hey.
- All right.

142
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,151
Well, I guess we're looking
for another surfer, then.

143
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,080
- Yeah, I'll start digging into Manny's personals.
- Wait. Hey.

144
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,198
Let's keep this quiet,
keep the press from pouncing.

145
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,360
- Yeah.
- It's okay, Detective!

146
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,635
I assume you got held up with
that needy offspring of yours

147
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,911
and simply forgot to call,
but no matter.

148
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,237
I'm here.

149
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,193
Actually, I chose
not to call you.

150
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,631
Okay.

151
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,077
Well, whilst I'm sure there's a
perfectly reasonable explanation

152
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,430
for that, there's something
very important

153
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,960
I need to discuss
with you first.

154
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,271
- Oh. Okay.
- Um...

155
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,274
I need your help
investigating someone.

156
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,072
What?

157
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,118
Someone very clever and cunning,
but they're lying to me,

158
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,834
and it's imperative
I get to the truth.

159
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,916
You came here to get my help?

160
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,640
- Very much so, yes.
<i>- My</i> help?

161
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,194
Are you having a senior moment?

162
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,674
No. No, I'm not having
a senior moment.

163
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,070
I'm finally
accepting you

164
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,677
for what you really are, which
is an egomaniacal narcissist!

165
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,311
But...

166
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,074
the only thing I can do...

167
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,680
is control how I respond.

168
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,276
By helping me?

169
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,150
By working
without you today.

170
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,074
Time to go home and be with
the person you love most.

171
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,956
Yourself.

172
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,557
Detective!

173
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,833
<i>So Cain from the Bible</i>

174
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,991
is alive.

175
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,951
Yes.

176
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,232
Is he dangerous?

177
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,590
Oh, probably.
I mean, we are talking about

178
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,876
the world's first murderer.

179
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,555
His own brother, no less.

180
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,269
Mm. And if anyone can find out
what he's up to,

181
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,834
it's the detective.

182
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,117
I just...

183
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,312
I don't understand
why she won't help me.

184
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,834
May I remind you
that you did break her trust

185
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,996
and kidnap a man

186
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,520
while working on a case
together.

187
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,871
Well, technically,
we kidnapped each other.

188
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,710
The point is...
perhaps it would help

189
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,276
if you saw Chloe's perspective
for a change.

190
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,750
I mean, friendship is
a two-way street.

191
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,997
Yes, but right now,
mine is clearly

192
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,270
the more important lane.

193
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,994
Okay, let's try
a different tack.

194
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,072
Maybe, if you thought about
how your actions affected her,

195
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,478
she might be more receptive
to how you feel.

196
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,669
So what you're saying is

197
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,872
I need to make it
all about <i>her</i> for a change?

198
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,151
Exactly.

199
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,317
And then she can make it
all about me.

200
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,713
Oh, that is brilliant, Doctor.

201
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,756
Yes.

202
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,950
Very good.

203
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,269
Should've seen that one coming.

204
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,796
<i>What the hell was that, Manny?!</i>

205
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,272
Hey, don't blame me 'cause you
cherry bombed your wave, dude.

206
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,357
I'm done with you.

207
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,789
You're dead, you hear me?!

208
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,070
You're totally dead!

209
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,797
Walk away.

210
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,713
This is "Dangerous Doug" Libby,

211
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,475
a nationally-ranked surfer
with a known history with Manny.

212
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,115
This fight took place
a week ago at Bells Beach.

213
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,993
Mm. It speaks
to motive,

214
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,600
but there's no
connection to the crime.

215
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,157
You can't get a
search warrant

216
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,714
for something as
flimsy as that.

217
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,880
At least, I wouldn't
give it to you.

218
00:08:59,280 --> 00:08:59,918
Oh.

219
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,159
You know, Doug is
supposed to compete

220
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,551
at the Huntington
Swell Classic later.

221
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,111
If I can get him to voluntarily
turn over his surf leash,

222
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,556
can you match that to the wound
on Manny's throat?

223
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,517
Sure.

224
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,319
Okay. I'll update
the lieutenant.

225
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,957
You are not being
your excessively

226
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,634
cheery self today.
What gives?

227
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,794
Fine, don't tell me.

228
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,832
Pierce yelled at me yesterday.

229
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,116
He said that I talk too much.

230
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,591
So I'm trying to talk less.

231
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,599
If I fell apart
every time a man told me

232
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,280
that he didn't like
what I was doing,

233
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,793
I'd be in a million pieces
right now.

234
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,356
But instead, I pushed through,
rose through the ranks,

235
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,836
built my own firm,
and here I am.

236
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,233
In this entry-level D.A. job.

237
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,280
But he's like a hero of mine.

238
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,596
You need to get a thicker skin.

239
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,156
Stand up for yourself,
because the truth is,

240
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,714
nobody's gonna do it for you.

241
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,636
Hey, Lieutenant.

242
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,392
Hey.

243
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,470
You going somewhere?

244
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,949
I put in for a transfer.

245
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,271
Only a few days left here.

246
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,310
Wow. That was fast.

247
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,154
What can I say? I got pull.

248
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,994
Uh, no, no. That's
not what I mean.

249
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,680
I-I just mean, why?

250
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,714
This, uh, about what
happened with the Sinnerman?

251
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,274
It's about a lot of things.

252
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,440
I thought coming here
would fix some of them,

253
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,996
but nothing changes,
not for me.

254
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,478
Well, maybe you should take
some time to think about it.

255
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,955
You know? Just, um...

256
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,474
Look, I know how hard it is,

257
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,752
and confusing it is
to deal with a shooting,

258
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,913
and, um, if you ever need
anyone to talk to...

259
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,270
It's done, okay?

260
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,239
Let's not make a big deal
out of this, Decker.

261
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:58,998
<i>You know,</i>

262
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,350
I just don't understand it.

263
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,358
I've never had
a human illness before.

264
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,835
But sore throat,

265
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,474
itchy eyes, a fever...

266
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,313
Is it a cold? The flu?

267
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,832
It's chlamydia.

268
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,838
Excuse me?

269
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,554
It's a sexually
transmitted disease.

270
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,389
Right, but I can't
have chlamydia.

271
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,511
I'm an angel.

272
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,590
Not to worry.

273
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,877
A round of antibiotics

274
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,394
and you'll be back
to your, uh,

275
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,869
angelic ways.

276
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,279
Now, the important thing
is to focus on next steps.

277
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,517
Do you know
how you got it?

278
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,995
I have no idea.

279
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,874
Well, have you been engaging
in any risky sexual behavior?

280
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,593
Well, I did have sex
with a prostitute.

281
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,075
But I...

282
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,150
didn't know
she was a prostitute.

283
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,471
Uh-huh.

284
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,711
I've also been making love
to an amazing woman

285
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,513
who I have genuine feelings for.

286
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,430
But we have a mutual friend
that doesn't want us together,

287
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,758
and she is not one
to be trifled with, so...

288
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,597
It's, um...

289
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,910
complicated.

290
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,711
Right. Call all
your recent partners,

291
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,434
even the ones
before the prostitute

292
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,677
just in case it wasn't her.

293
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,390
They all need to be tested.

294
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,354
Hello, Detective.

295
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,075
Lovely day for a bit of sunshine
and sand, don't you think?

296
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,232
Lucifer, why are you here?

297
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,790
Well, I realize
that I have been remiss

298
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,912
in prioritizing you
in our friendship.

299
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,634
So I'd like
to make it up to you

300
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,435
by deeming today Detective Day.

301
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,640
What does that even mean?

302
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,160
Well, it means
that for the rest of the day,

303
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,670
everything that I do
shall be for you.

304
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,396
Thanks, but I'm working a case.

305
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,750
Ah, now, I know

306
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,110
that you need
to get close

307
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,959
to Mr. Dangerous Doug Libby.

308
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,913
But since you don't have
a warrant, you need to do so

309
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,440
without blowing your cover.
Am I right?

310
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,398
Maybe.

311
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,193
Well, that's gonna be
quite difficult, isn't it?

312
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,239
Unless, of course...

313
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,117
someone signed you up
for the competition.

314
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,513
This might actually help.

315
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,154
Yes, I know.
But wait!

316
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,994
There's more.

317
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,396
Now, since you're
going in undercover,

318
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,035
why not do it
with a little panache?

319
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,876
Nice try.
I'm not putting that on.

320
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,350
But I will keep the access pass.

321
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,277
Right.

322
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,312
- Uh, Detective?
- What?!

323
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,552
Well, you don't want to damage

324
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,479
that perfect skin of yours,
now, do you?

325
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,111
So...

326
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,198
how should we get close
to this Dangerous Doug?

327
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,557
You do nothing.
I'll handle this.

328
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,035
Hey, there.

329
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,756
Dangerous Doug?

330
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,079
I just wanted to say hi.
I-I'm such a huge fan.

331
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,633
Well, aloha.

332
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,071
I'm, um,
I'm new to the circuit.

333
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,919
I joined down in San Diego.

334
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,600
It's nice to meet you.

335
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,075
Who's the sugar daddy?

336
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,031
What?

337
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,994
Oh. Oh.

338
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,117
Him.

339
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,477
He's-he's just...
He's my sponsor.

340
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,160
He's totally
overbearing

341
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,999
and absolutely not needed.

342
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,511
Right.

343
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,952
So, anyhow, I just wanted to see

344
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,919
if maybe you'd want to
go surfing sometime.

345
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,679
I found this really
rad beach up in Malibu.

346
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,957
It's, um, called Carbon.

347
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,077
Oh, yeah, I've been there.

348
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,760
I know all the secret beaches.

349
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,997
Well, I just,
I really admire your style,

350
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,476
and, you know, I'd love
to check out your board...

351
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,598
- Is-is this your board?
- Oh, yeah.

352
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,069
- Oh, yeah. Oh.
- This right here,

353
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,670
this is my Bonzer.
She's great on turns.

354
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,280
Perfect for roundhouses.

355
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,000
She's insane
in the barrel.

356
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,510
So, Dougy,

357
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,798
did you, uh, hurt yourself?

358
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,075
No. Why?

359
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,672
Looks like someone bit it
really hard here.

360
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,516
Did you hit someone?

361
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,955
Who'd you say you were again?

362
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,159
Next up,
Chloe "The Detective" Decker.

363
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,233
Got to be kidding me.

364
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,477
You're a cop?

365
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,352
Sorry, Dougy.

366
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,437
LAPD.

367
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,478
Sorry!

368
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,313
I'm afraid
this is evidence, Dougy.

369
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,034
- Let go!
- Okay.

370
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,435
See?

371
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,560
Detective Day.

372
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,909
Now, wasn't that refreshing?

373
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,077
A lovely day at the beach,
and you caught a murderer.

374
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,391
It's like the whole world
revolves around you, Detective.

375
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,750
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

376
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,280
We still need to get a
confession out of Doug

377
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,278
or match the blood
on the board to Manny.

378
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,311
Well, whatever you
need, Detective.

379
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,074
I am solely here for you.

380
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,272
Look, I know what you're doing.

381
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,239
Being the most selfless devil
you've ever met?

382
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,836
You're only helping me
so that I help you back,

383
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,800
which is actually worse
than not helping me at all.

384
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,480
So thanks but no thanks.

385
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,120
But, Detective,
surely you can appreciate

386
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,754
- a benevolent gesture.
- Save it.

387
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,758
Lucifer, I know this case
doesn't matter to you.

388
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,714
- That's not...
- Ready?

389
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,751
Yeah.

390
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,677
<i>He's dead, isn't he?</i>

391
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,439
Yes, Doug. He's dead.

392
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,871
Oh, God.
I can't believe it.

393
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,800
I'm totally a killer.

394
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,276
Look-look, you don't understand.
He-he just came out of nowhere.

395
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,472
All right,
just calm down.

396
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,119
Take a breath and take
us through everything.

397
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,840
From the beginning, okay?

398
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,635
I was surfing, man,

399
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,280
and I caught
this killer wave, and...

400
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,073
he just came out of nowhere.

401
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,476
I slammed into him
with my board.

402
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,514
God, there was so much blood.

403
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,633
It was everywhere.
God.

404
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,638
Anytime I close my eyes,
I can...

405
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,953
can hear that awful sound.

406
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,640
He just wouldn't stop barking.

407
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,835
Um, I'm sorry.
Did you say barking?

408
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,430
That poor seal. I killed him.

409
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,073
I killed the dog of the sea.

410
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,795
Hold on a second. You...

411
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,753
you think you're here
'cause you killed a seal?

412
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,155
Yeah.

413
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,356
Why else would I be here?

414
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,756
Well...

415
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,711
Whoa.

416
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,595
Manny's dead, too?

417
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,396
Oh. Pardon me.

418
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,717
Cream? Sugar?

419
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,711
Or do you take it
dark and bitter like your soul?

420
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,875
Uh...

421
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,832
What?

422
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,999
Do you enjoy beating up on
your subordinates, Mr. Pierce?

423
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,873
Is that why you became
a lieutenant?

424
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,312
Have we even met?

425
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,920
Oh, Charlotte Richards.

426
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,516
I'm your new prosecutor,

427
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,359
and you are
just that kind of bully

428
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,358
that makes me miss
my old self.

429
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,236
If I wasn't on the road
to virtue and righteousness,

430
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,157
I would crush you
like a cockroach.

431
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,232
I believe you.

432
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,033
But, look, I don't know
what this is about.

433
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,594
I'm sorry
if I offended you somehow.

434
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,071
Oh, I'm not the one
you should be apologizing to.

435
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,551
Ella Lopez

436
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,360
may be astonishingly perky
and optimistic,

437
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,916
but she doesn't deserve to have
her spirit crushed by anyone,

438
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,710
especially not
a man who,

439
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,800
for some unknown reason,
she looks up to.

440
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,556
Hmm. Shame on you.

441
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,151
Ah, Detective, please.
I really need your...

442
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,800
Ah, Detective Douche.

443
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,317
Daniel. Sorry. Sorry, old habit.

444
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,830
I think it's because
I'm distressed,

445
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,878
and I need your advice.

446
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,199
Now, you've managed

447
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,238
to offend the detective
more than anyone,

448
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,874
to the point where
she actually divorced you.

449
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,789
Yet, you always seem
to bounce back. How?

450
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,639
- Okay, first off...
- Hmm.

451
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,116
our divorce was mutual.

452
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,551
Mm-hmm. Right. And?

453
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,150
And it's not brain surgery, man.
Y-You just...

454
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,073
You got to find a way...

455
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,877
to be thoughtful
without getting in her face.

456
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,912
Like, this one time,
I made her breakfast in bed.

457
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,754
French toast, whipped
cream, homemade jam.

458
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,275
Man, she really loved it.

459
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,315
And, you know, maybe

460
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,757
if I had done
more things like that, sh...

461
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,636
Sh...

462
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,236
I wouldn't be standing alone,
talking to myself.

463
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,753
<i>This is the RX-5500.</i>

464
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,474
World's most deadly
hunting knife.

465
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,719
Made with
Friction Forging,

466
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,311
it's so sharp it can literally
cut bone like butter.

467
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,635
And now...

468
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,955
I want you

469
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,033
to get what
you deserve.

470
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,637
Oh, God.

471
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,473
It's a gift, stupid.

472
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,954
For being such a great friend.

473
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,640
Look, I really appreciate
how you handled

474
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,516
the whole me not wanting you
and Amenadiel to bone thing.

475
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,478
This is unnecessary, Maze.

476
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,431
Stop it.

477
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,519
Okay? You deserve it.

478
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,156
Look...

479
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,355
there's something
I need to tell you.

480
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,355
Oh.

481
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,630
What?

482
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:17,991
Uh-huh.

483
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,953
Yeah. Is that it?
Whatever.

484
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,036
Stupid Amenadiel.

485
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,350
Sorry. You were saying?

486
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,677
- Is everything okay?
- Eh, no big deal.

487
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,352
He's just whining
about having chlamydia.

488
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,796
Yeah.

489
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,191
Dodged that bullet, huh?

490
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,156
Yep.

491
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,715
Bullet dodged, all right.

492
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,355
Hey. So, forensics came back,

493
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,154
and I can't believe
I'm saying this.

494
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,636
Blood on the board?
Definitely seal blood.

495
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,874
Well,
I did some digging myself.

496
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,151
Apparently there is
a Huntington surf gang

497
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,436
known as the Orcas.

498
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,676
Know what their M.O. is?

499
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,435
Using surf leashes
to choke people

500
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,869
and scare them off their turf.

501
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,232
- Any confirmed murders?
- No, not yet.

502
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,590
But there's always a first.

503
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,995
Their leader,
known as Wildchild,

504
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,118
has been picked up
almost a dozen times

505
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,710
for battery, vandalism,
assault with a deadly weapon.

506
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,316
These guys do not mess around.

507
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,319
Okay, but if the Orcas
are from Huntington Beach,

508
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,670
what were they doing
up at Carbon?

509
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,235
According to these,

510
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,352
the Orcas tag
was recently put up all around

511
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,710
where Manny's
body was found.

512
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,912
So, I don't know.
Maybe they're expanding?

513
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,760
Okay, only problem is a graffiti
tag doesn't prove murder.

514
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,832
Right. We need leverage.

515
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,920
We need to force one of
the Orcas to roll over. But how?

516
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,875
These surfers are like a tribe.

517
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,870
I have an idea.

518
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,914
This isn't a good idea.

519
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,079
Trust me. It's gonna work.

520
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,429
Okay, maybe it'll work.

521
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,396
Dan, do you see anything?

522
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,835
I see some Orcas,

523
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,672
but no sign
of their big bad leader yet.

524
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,760
Don't let your guard down
just yet.

525
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,036
Wildchild just pulled up.

526
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,509
Should be coming
at you any minute.

527
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,598
Are you sure
Espinoza's up for this?

528
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,720
He's fine.
All he has to do

529
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,480
is get the Orcas riled enough
that they try and rough him up.

530
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,275
He yells the safe word, we
move in; it's a piece of cake.

531
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,153
Although, I don't know
how I'm supposed

532
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,158
to get "surf's up"
casually in a sentence.

533
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,840
I mean, maybe we should consider
using a different safe word.

534
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:35,991
Good luck, Espinoza.

535
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,317
Copy.

536
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,791
All right, Dan,
you're up.

537
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,315
Wildchild's
on the beach.

538
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,750
How do I look?

539
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,077
You look like
you're about to get

540
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,555
your ass kicked by a girl.

541
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,829
When you pick up your
jaw, remember that the Orcas

542
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,997
don't move a muscle
without Wildchild's nod.

543
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,078
So stay on task, okay?

544
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,752
Trust me.

545
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,320
I know how to tick off a lady.

546
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,913
No, Mazikeen, I don't think
the detective wants a knife.

547
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,356
I'm trying to be
thoughtful here.

548
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,996
Hello?

549
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,192
Well, someone's in a mood today.

550
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,154
What, as if the detective
doesn't have

551
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,158
enough on her plate already!

552
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,074
Deary me...

553
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,670
Good thing for her she's got
a partner to pick up the slack.

554
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,591
Right.

555
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,074
Now what do I do?

556
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,472
Okay, I've done
everything I can imagine

557
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,875
to be helpful
to the detective,

558
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,753
and I'm literally
out of ideas.

559
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,509
Can you think of anything?

560
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,310
No. But you know
what would help me?

561
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,280
You... scrubbing
these test tubes.

562
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,159
I want them spick-and-span.

563
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,271
And, if you don't mind,

564
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,352
how about you do it
with a frickin' smile!

565
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,159
Are you feeling all right,
Ms. Lopez?

566
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,912
This isn't me, is it?

567
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,679
Afraid not. No. Uh...

568
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,270
I'm sorry, okay? I'm just...

569
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,550
I'm trying to practice

570
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,399
standing up for myself
against Pierce.

571
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,273
And I've got, like,
no time to figure it out,

572
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,516
- 'cause he's leaving soon...
- Wait.

573
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,830
What do you mean
Pierce is leaving?

574
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,636
Yeah. Didn't you hear?

575
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,274
He's about to transfer
out of the department.

576
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,040
No. No, no, no.

577
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,832
Good job.

578
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,750
Here goes nothing.

579
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,232
<i>I guess we finally</i>

580
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,238
found Espinoza's true calling.

581
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,720
Pissing people off.

582
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,674
I might actually miss
making fun of that guy.

583
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,316
Maybe you don't have to.

584
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,438
I mean, you might
find this surprising, but...

585
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,915
Dan has become way more
fond of you lately.

586
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,517
And I-I think
he appreciates your quirks,

587
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,394
and I'm pretty sure
he's gonna miss you.

588
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,477
<i>He</i> is?

589
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,637
Mm-hmm.

590
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,752
And so might... some others.

591
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,557
You know?

592
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,311
But point is, maybe
you don't have to go.

593
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,359
Ah! There you are.

594
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,677
What, did you come to make it
"all about me" again?

595
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,513
Nope. It's all
about him now.

596
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,677
'Cause he's crazy if he thinks
I'm letting him leave town

597
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,230
without finishing
our conversation.

598
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,119
Give us a sec, will you?

599
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,593
Keep an eye on Dan, will you?

600
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,434
After all, this is a sting.

601
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,875
You know, a sting?

602
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,556
I want answers.

603
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,110
<i>You</i> want answers?

604
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,919
- Mm.
- Okay.

605
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:39,957
Fine.

606
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,517
Go ahead.

607
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,917
Do your thing.

608
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,477
What?

609
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,796
- Ask me!
- Oh.

610
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,836
Very well... Cain.

611
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,313
What is it that you desire?

612
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,717
I want...

613
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,910
...to die.

614
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,712
What?

615
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,760
To die? I...

616
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,712
What does that have to do
with coming here, or me?

617
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,479
It has nothing to do with you.

618
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,759
And everything to do with her.

619
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,475
But... why?

620
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,117
I don't understand.

621
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,558
<i>What does the detective
have to do with wanting to die?</i>

622
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,517
I've walked this Earth
for thousands of years.

623
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,916
I have seen everything,
I have done everything.

624
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,958
I have watched everything
I've ever known

625
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,198
turn to ashes
over and over again.

626
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,470
It's almost like you're in...

627
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,870
Hell? Yeah.

628
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,600
And I've been searching
for a way out forever.

629
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,033
Keeping an eye on
every celestial on Earth

630
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,037
and what they're doing.

631
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,998
<i>How and why they seem
to come and go.</i>

632
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,077
So imagine my surprise
when I find out

633
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,677
there's a detective who somehow
made the Devil bleed.

634
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,993
For the first time, I had hope.

635
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,590
Maybe she could do for me
what she did for you.

636
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,433
Then finally you'd be free.

637
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:19,798
Yeah.

638
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,434
Then why kidnap me?

639
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,989
Because in order
to test my theory,

640
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,873
I needed you out of the way.

641
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,519
<i>So I hired someone to knock
you out when Chloe was close.</i>

642
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,752
<i>Then zou sprouted wings
and came back early,</i>

643
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,030
<i>and screwed up
the entire plan.</i>

644
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,916
So I had to think on the fly.

645
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,996
Hold on.

646
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,154
The shooter at the ranch?

647
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,152
Yeah.

648
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,755
You let him know
you were coming?

649
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,592
<i>Hoping he'd react
the way that he did?</i>

650
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,473
You put the detective in danger!

651
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,510
And even then, with Chloe
right beside me, it didn't work.

652
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,919
So that little bit
of hope I had?

653
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:03,951
It's gone.

654
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,238
Oh, boo-hoo.

655
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,990
What about everything else
that happened to me?

656
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,672
Honestly, I don't know.

657
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,270
You're telling the truth.

658
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,396
Stage one's complete.

659
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,072
But I got to tell you,
I think these guys are all talk.

660
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,235
I've pissed every single one
of them off,

661
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,669
and no one's moved yet.

662
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,596
Oh, hey, guys.

663
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,917
What's up?

664
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,196
Dan?

665
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,076
Dan, are you all right?

666
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,911
Wow.

667
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,558
I guess that means surf's up.

668
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,439
I said, surf's up.

669
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,117
Did I just
knock something loose,

670
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,595
or are you always this lame?

671
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,150
Well, you didn't think that a...

672
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,393
that a punch was gonna
scare me off, did you?

673
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,592
No.

674
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,320
Should've just
walked away, kook.

675
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,631
I guess that's, uh...

676
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,754
that's how it went down
for Moondog, huh?

677
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,911
What'd you say?

678
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,478
I-I said that must have been
what you did to my boy Moondog.

679
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,237
Before he died.

680
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,510
Doesn't make any sense.

681
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,870
I mean, there must
have been a reason

682
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:46,991
my wings appeared
at that moment.

683
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,594
There has to have been.

684
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,793
Maybe, but it wasn't
because of me.

685
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,151
I lost audio on Dan.
What's going on?

686
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,831
Is that blood?

687
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,070
Well, I mean, that could mean

688
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,396
any number of things,
couldn't it?

689
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,833
They couldn't have
gotten far. He's injured.

690
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,440
What in the hell
are they doing?

691
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,273
It's a paddle-out ceremony.

692
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,678
When you told us
Manny was dead, I was stunned.

693
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,273
'Cause Moondog was like
one of us...

694
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,476
a free spirit who wanted
to be one with the ocean.

695
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,149
At least now we know he is.

696
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,358
Go ahead.

697
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,471
Say something.

698
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,511
Uh...

699
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,114
Manny was...

700
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,950
a great guy.

701
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,790
And he meant

702
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,679
so much to...

703
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,231
a lot of people,

704
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,392
which is why

705
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,239
I came here today
to find his killer.

706
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,110
I thought it was
one of you guys.

707
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,239
Why would you think that, man?

708
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,799
'Cause he was strangled
by a surf leash.

709
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,673
And the Orcas' tags
are all over Carbon,

710
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,633
which is where
his body was found.

711
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,835
That's crazy.

712
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,557
Yeah, maybe,
but I saw it myself.

713
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,359
We don't
go up to Carbon.

714
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,154
Those private beaches
are all blocked off.

715
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,238
Those rich snobs make it clear
we're not welcome there,

716
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,396
so why bother?

717
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,392
The ocean's a big place.

718
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,832
Now, enough of that.

719
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,674
Let's take this moment.

720
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,920
For Moondog.

721
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,717
For Moondog.

722
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,953
Moondog.

723
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,272
<i>I'm telling you guys,
I believe them.</i>

724
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,472
Why? Just 'cause they put
flowers in the water?

725
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,719
No. Because they didn't
know I was a cop,

726
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,593
and their motive's
all but vanished.

727
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,035
I think someone's
trying to set them up.

728
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,790
I mean, they don't
even go up to Carbon.

729
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,877
It's too much
of a hassle.

730
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,675
Sloth... truly one of the world's
most deplorable sins.

731
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,757
If you want something,

732
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,997
you have to be willing
to go the extra mile.

733
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:29,997
What do you think?

734
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,919
I'm particularly proud
of the new filing system,

735
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,237
complete with a
"Sexy Victims" pile,

736
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,676
"Obvious Killers" pile.

737
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,156
Oh, and "Boring Crimes" pile,
to be ignored, of course.

738
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,079
Cannot even.
Cannot even.

739
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,237
Should have gone with
the French toast.

740
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,596
As if it wasn't bad enough
you betrayed me,

741
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,396
nearly costing me my job,
almost getting Dan killed...

742
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,239
I mean, did you really think
I was dumb enough

743
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,000
to help you just because
you tried to clean up my desk

744
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,873
and actually made it worse?

745
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,799
I mean, what even is that?

746
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,956
It's me.

747
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,710
Are you that self-absorbed

748
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,112
that you don't realize
how your actions hurt people?

749
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,152
Hurt me?

750
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,629
- Detective.
- And I can only assume

751
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,712
that you asked Pierce
for help, too,

752
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,912
which is nuts, by the way.

753
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,072
But I want to make
one thing clear:

754
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,751
you can just stop
with this selfless charade,

755
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,832
because I am never
going to help you

756
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,639
with this investigation
of yours.

757
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,069
Oh, I don't need
your help anymore.

758
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,112
Then why are you still here?

759
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,719
Because this case
matters to you.

760
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,630
Therefore, it matters to me.

761
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,634
We're... we're partners,
Detective.

762
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,158
Next time,
you want to just start there?

763
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,794
Next time. So we're...?

764
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,832
Okay.

765
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,995
"Hot Suspects"?

766
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,233
An entire folder for graffiti?

767
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,278
This is gonna take me forever
to re-sort, you know.

768
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,550
No, wait, w-what
are you doing?

769
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,070
It took me ages to line up these right angles.

770
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,117
Holy crap.
That's it. You did it.

771
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,756
Okay, Detective,
I get it.

772
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,155
You don't like the
new filing system.

773
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,714
- But this is a bit excessive.
- No.

774
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,479
The Orcas.
Remember how they said

775
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,478
that they never go up to Carbon
because it's private?

776
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,110
California has no private
beaches, which means...

777
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,158
Someone must have put
the signs up illegally.

778
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,115
And look here.

779
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,880
One person was cited
dozens of times

780
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,116
for posting at Carbon.

781
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,115
To you, Detective.

782
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,636
Hey! Hey.

783
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,833
What do you think
you're doing?

784
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,312
This is private
property.

785
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,670
Didn't you see the signs?

786
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,394
Oh, I'm so sorry.

787
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,477
I must have missed those.

788
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,511
Did you happen to see them?

789
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,070
No.

790
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,551
No.

791
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,831
You know, someone must have
taken them down.

792
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,076
I don't know who
you two think you are,

793
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,670
but I'm calling the police.

794
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,633
What, you mean
like those police?

795
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,636
The beach signs you posted
are illegal, Justine,

796
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,071
and you know what that
helps with? A search warrant.

797
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,834
I wonder if
the officers will find

798
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,520
anything of interest
in there.

799
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,951
Yes, I wonder.
Maybe a surf leash

800
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,117
used to strangle a
young surfer, perhaps.

801
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,354
I don't know what
you're talking about.

802
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,671
This is insane.

803
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,031
Oh, come on,
tell us the truth.

804
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,509
Did he steal from you?

805
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,200
Hmm? Did he
owe you cash?

806
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,074
Or perhaps it was some kind of
sexual liaison that went awry.

807
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,031
Really, I must know.

808
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,072
What the hell is wrong
with you people?

809
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,871
You come to my house
and accuse me of murder?

810
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,879
This isn't your home, Justine.

811
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,117
This beach doesn't belong
to anyone.

812
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,879
But that was the problem,
wasn't it?

813
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,950
You are wasting your time here.

814
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,039
Manny came here to surf,
you had enough, and you snapped.

815
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,720
No, that's not true.

816
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,636
Well, you say
that, Justine,

817
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,799
but the police officer up there
holding a surfboard says yes.

818
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,359
Sorry.
You were saying?

819
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,880
You don't get it.

820
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,557
I paid for this land.

821
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,638
I even put up signs,
but they trampled

822
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,320
this whole beach
like it was their own.

823
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,512
They trashed
this whole area,

824
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,915
and I just couldn't
take it anymore.

825
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,833
I-I had to send a message.

826
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,800
And that's why you framed
the Orcas for Manny's murder.

827
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,114
If people
were scared enough,

828
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,511
then finally
they would stay away.

829
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,837
Hold on.

830
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,112
So you're saying
your brazen act of violence,

831
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,277
it wasn't personal at all?

832
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,512
Manny was just a means
to an end.

833
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,872
You're under arrest, Justine,
for the murder of Manny Taylor.

834
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,599
After all that, I could
really use a glass of champagne.

835
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:47,877
Chee...

836
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,878
He is who he is.

837
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,634
<i>This sneaking around,</i>

838
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,591
I can't do it anymore,
Amenadiel.

839
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,875
I'm so relieved
to hear you say that,

840
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,116
because I feel the same way.

841
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,915
- You do?
- I do.

842
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,391
You see, I realize

843
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,240
that I don't want to hide
our relationship anymore.

844
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,360
Well, that's not
exactly what I mean.

845
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,392
I'm not sure if we should be...

846
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,196
intimate together at all.

847
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,640
Is this because
I have chlamydia?

848
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,277
Uh...

849
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,279
No. I mean...
I mean, it doesn't help.

850
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,390
I mean, I can't believe
you slept with a prostitute.

851
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,559
First off, I didn't know
she was a prostitute.

852
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,957
Secondly, you had sex
with my brother,

853
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,916
the biggest whore
on the planet.

854
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,713
How do I know you didn't
give <i>me</i> chlamydia?!

855
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,832
- Okay, how dare you?
- How dare you?

856
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,956
Uh, it's my doctor.

857
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,111
What do you know?

858
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,352
False positive on the chlamydia.

859
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,316
So, I guess
we fought for nothing.

860
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,232
Well, it's not
for nothing, Amenadiel.

861
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,317
I mean, yes,

862
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,753
I'm relieved
we don't have... chlamydia.

863
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,395
I don't think
we should be together.

864
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,790
I don't understand.

865
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,520
I feel like I'm being
a bad friend to Maze.

866
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,991
It doesn't matter
how much I like you.

867
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,556
I can't date
my friend's ex anymore.

868
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,671
But I do... really like you.

869
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,399
And I really like you.

870
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,076
Lopez, you got a second?

871
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,673
No. Me first.

872
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,556
I talk a lot, okay? I know that.

873
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,556
But most people seem
to like it, okay?

874
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,594
And-and what's more important
is I like it.

875
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,754
Okay, so even
if you hate it,

876
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,999
which you shouldn't,
but-but even if you do,

877
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,239
it doesn't give you the right to
yell at me the way that you did.

878
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,995
I-It was rude

879
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,352
and unprofessional, and-and
I think you owe me an apology.

880
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,431
You're right.

881
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,439
I was in a bad place,
and I took it out on you,

882
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,080
and there's no excuse for that.

883
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:04,871
I'm sorry.

884
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,632
You were in
a bad place? Really?

885
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,160
Is there anything I can do?
D-Do you need a hug?

886
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,751
Sure. Why not?

887
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,795
You're gonna miss me.

888
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,079
Where do you think you're going?

889
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,554
I didn't figure you
for the sentimental type.

890
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,872
Oh, believe me, I'm not.

891
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,438
I'm here because
I finally figured out

892
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,314
why my father returned my wings.

893
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,433
And as it turns out,

894
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,550
it had nothing to do
with me at all.

895
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,711
It was about you.

896
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,316
How many times
do I have to tell you

897
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,749
I had nothing to do
with your wings?

898
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,674
I know, but my father did.

899
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,396
He wanted to stop

900
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,071
you defying Him,
and He used me to do it.

901
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,271
You said yourself

902
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,711
you needed me out of the way.

903
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,196
And since my wings ruined
your kidnapping plan,

904
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,394
it seems I was
a means to an end.

905
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,111
So what?

906
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,511
It means my dad screwed us both.

907
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,754
But perhaps there's a way
for us to screw him back.

908
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,711
How?

909
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,920
By killing you, of course.

910
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,357
I thought we went
over this already.

911
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,233
You can't die, I know.

912
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,950
But I promise you,

913
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,549
if you stay,

914
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,235
I will find a way to end
your infinite misery,

915
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,318
if it's the last thing I do.

916
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,958
What makes you think
you can do that?

917
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,436
Well, you may have
crossed paths with God,

918
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,314
but you've certainly
never made a deal

919
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,557
with the Devil before,
now, have you?

920
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,440
What say we change that?

921
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,476
What do I have to lose?

922
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,590
Well, hopefully,

923
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,310
your life.
