00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,634
<i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,559
I'm really glad
that you told me how you felt.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,878
The one man I've cared about,
I still gave him up.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,037
That's how much I care
about our friendship.

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,476
Go to hell.

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,195
Chloe Decker, will you marry me?

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,470
<i>Lucifer's the reason</i>

8
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,875
<i>that I said yes to Pierce.</i>

9
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,474
<i>He's also the reason
that I said no.</i>

10
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,594
Okay, you could kill me, sure.

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,551
But Linda would die, too.

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,752
<i>I was afraid</i>

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,593
that if you saw all of me,

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,438
you would run away.

15
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,313
Chloe, I am the Devil.

16
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,670
No, you're not.

17
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,150
Not to me.

18
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,238
I have been coming here
ever since I realized that

19
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,470
this may be
the closest

20
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,995
to Heaven that I'll ever get.

21
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,350
Let's go home.

22
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,472
I'll never get to
see her again.

23
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,311
I know.

24
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,593
I still can't believe it.

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,552
Well, at least you'll get
to see her, Detective.

26
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,079
Eventually. In Heaven.

27
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,274
But I... well, sadly,
she's gone somewhere

28
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,914
I simply can't follow.

29
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,435
You know I'm here
for you, right?

30
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,072
And I you, Detective.

31
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,510
How's poor Daniel?

32
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,234
Hmm, about as good
as you could expect.

33
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,870
He's throwing himself
into work,

34
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,595
but so far we've come up empty.

35
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,551
No witnesses.

36
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,560
No security cameras up here.

37
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,594
Hey, Ella.

38
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,790
You have anything?

39
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,238
Uh, no, nothing yet.

40
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,113
I'm trying, I-I really am,

41
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,357
but there's, uh, no DNA,

42
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,755
no fingerprints.

43
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,000
Uh, bullets are
nine millimeter.

44
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,796
Pretty common, so
that's not helpful.

45
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,710
Who would do something
like this?

46
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,639
Okay, everyone,
I know this is hard.

47
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,070
But time is of the essence.

48
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,232
Lopez, I want you

49
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,709
to expand the search area.

50
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,389
Decker, build a suspect list.

51
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,911
Espinoza...

52
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,238
go home.

53
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,113
- I need to be here, Lieutenant.
- Dan...

54
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,312
you need to grieve.

55
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,431
I will grieve...

56
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,517
when it's done.

57
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,750
We're gonna find
who did this.

58
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,600
I'm on it, Lieutenant.

59
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,471
Uh, Lucifer, hold
back a second.

60
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,716
Have you spoken
to Amenadiel?

61
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,237
- Why?
- Well, I know

62
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,671
he and Charlotte were close.
He might know something.

63
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,437
I can talk to him myself
if you have an idea where he is.

64
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,433
Well, I think I know
exactly where he is.

65
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,197
You do?

66
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,910
Yes.

67
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,474
I'm-I'm not following.

68
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,911
Well, it appears

69
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,873
that my brother
got his wings back.

70
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,957
How is that possible?

71
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,074
Amenadiel had a crazy theory...

72
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,276
or so I thought...

73
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,790
that everything
that's happened to us,

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,753
him losing his wings,
me gaining mine,

75
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,235
even my lost Devil face...

76
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,319
- And you believe that?
- Well, I didn't.

77
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,433
But I'm fairly certain
he's up in Heaven now

78
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,994
and took dear Charlotte
with him,

79
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,917
so perhaps
there's something to it.

80
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,038
- You think Amenadiel's gone forever?
- Well, who knows

81
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,878
if he'll ever return,

82
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,992
now he's finally home
in the Silver City.

83
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,360
Okay. No Amenadiel. Great.

84
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,357
Excuse me?

85
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,870
It's one less thing to juggle

86
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,196
as we try to track down
this killer.

87
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,358
Right.

88
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,795
Oh, wow.

89
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,397
The Sinnerman
himself returns.

90
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,153
You know,
the boys will be thrilled.

91
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,474
Everyone's ready
to get back to business.

92
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,034
I'm not back.

93
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,078
I just need something
taken care of.

94
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,312
Any luck so far?

95
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,795
Well, I went through the list.

96
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,192
I found the perfect favor
to cash in.

97
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,880
Should do
just the trick.

98
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,436
Good work.

99
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,156
You okay, boss?

100
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,754
I've never seen you scared.

101
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,154
You're right, you haven't.

102
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,793
Because I've never been
scared of dying before.

103
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,640
Of losing everything.

104
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,830
But that doesn't make me weak,
it makes me more dangerous.

105
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,440
Yeah. Sure.

106
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,789
Okay, boss.

107
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,195
Uh...

108
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,557
What do you want us to do with
the woman back at your place?

109
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,637
I may still need her.

110
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,796
Keep her alive.

111
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:44,952
For now.

112
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,716
Don't worry.

113
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,400
My best men are on her.

114
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,631
Linda.

115
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,638
Wouldn't worry about
your friend, sweetie.

116
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,280
You got bigger problems.

117
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,950
She doesn't seem that scary.

118
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,031
My nose!

119
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,833
She broke my damn nose!

120
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,276
<i>I hope Maze is okay.</i>

121
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,273
- Why is that?
- Well, I had to book another sitter,

122
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,510
'cause I couldn't
get a hold of her.

123
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,597
She's Maze.

124
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,677
I'm sure she's fine.

125
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,599
- Yeah.
- This is astounding.

126
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,116
Who knew Charlotte was
prosecuting so many cases?

127
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,589
I know, and she wasn't afraid

128
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,678
to go after
the most dangerous criminals.

129
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,310
That's our Charlotte.

130
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,557
Yeah.

131
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:12,952
Guys.

132
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,589
There's something
you need to know.

133
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,474
Now, it's gonna sound
completely crazy,

134
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,400
but I need you
to hear me out, okay?

135
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,632
Of course.

136
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,717
What is it?

137
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,480
Try not to react.

138
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,031
If anyone realizes what we know,

139
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,151
our lives are in danger.

140
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,752
Okay. Okay. What's up, Dan?

141
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,960
I figured out
who killed Charlotte.

142
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,913
What?
It was Pierce.

143
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,395
What are you talking
about, Daniel?

144
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,312
Why would he do that?

145
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,877
Charlotte was investigating him.

146
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,911
She was? Why?

147
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,636
Well, that's the craziest part.

148
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,717
Pierce...

149
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,840
Pierce is The Sinnerman.

150
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,674
Dan, listen, uh...

151
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,917
I can't imagine what you're
going through right now.

152
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,276
But this does sound a little...

153
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,231
Insane?

154
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,596
Completely nuts? No, I get it.

155
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,234
I know what it sounds like,
Chloe, but do you believe me...

156
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,271
Daniel's right.

157
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,517
- Excuse me?
- Pierce is indeed The Sinnerman.

158
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,949
I mean, I don't know
if he killed Charlotte,

159
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,675
but he certainly seemed mightily
relieved Amenadiel was gone.

160
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,637
Wait, you knew?

161
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,711
Yes. He told me months ago.

162
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,677
- What?
- You knew?

163
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,956
You freakin' knew?

164
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,116
- Daniel, Daniel!
- You...

165
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,834
Daniel, like you said.

166
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,076
Please, be careful,

167
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,430
people are watching.

168
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,591
Okay?

169
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,714
Good? Yes?

170
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,957
This cannot be true. Can it?

171
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,994
I mean... if you knew this,
why wouldn't you say something?

172
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,600
I mean, I almost married him.

173
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,793
I mean,
I almost married him.

174
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,639
I tried to tell you,
but you wouldn't listen.

175
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,593
No, you said he's immortal,

176
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,154
and that is something
completely different.

177
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,999
Is it? If I'd told you
he was The Sinnerman as well,

178
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,720
- would you have believed me?
- I don't know,

179
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,717
maybe!

180
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,671
Maybe, because that's something
that actually exists,

181
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,360
and not some metaphor
that you've made up.

182
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,199
I haven't made up anything,
Detective,

183
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,993
I always tell you the truth,
no matter what.

184
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,190
Okay, ignoring

185
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,154
all the craziness,
do you believe me, Chloe?

186
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,033
I-I...

187
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,838
I don't see anything in here
that proves it.

188
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,360
Pierce wants
to talk to everyone.

189
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,552
<i>Charlotte Richards
was one of us.</i>

190
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,910
She fought tooth and nail

191
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,833
to make sure
that our arrests stuck.

192
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,200
To make sure that the bad
guys stayed off the streets.

193
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,591
And now...

194
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,509
Pierce doesn't get emotional.

195
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,757
Now she's gone.

196
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,034
I don't like this. He's lying.

197
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,152
But we will find
whoever did this.

198
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,036
We need to get justice
for Charlotte.

199
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,598
If it's the last thing
that we do.

200
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,109
He did it, didn't he?

201
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,757
He killed Charlotte.

202
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,553
It appears so, Detective.

203
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,879
And now he's overseeing
the whole damn investigation.

204
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,755
How do we take him down?

205
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,796
How do we approach this?

206
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,118
You buy me five minutes
in interrogation with that dick,

207
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,477
- and I swear to you, I will break him.
- Dan.

208
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,114
You're gonna need to get
a hold of your anger.

209
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,436
I know
it's not easy.

210
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,678
It's the only way
that we can bring him down.

211
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,950
Can you do that?

212
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,552
Yeah.

213
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:16,958
I can.

214
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,913
- I have no choice.
- Yeah, she's right.

215
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,157
Pierce is more formidable
than either of you realize.

216
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,431
We are talking about the world's
first killer, after all.

217
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,751
And you.
No more of your metaphors.

218
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,872
- They're not metaphors.
- We need to focus on Pierce.

219
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,719
But when this is all done,
you and I are gonna talk

220
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,559
about everything that you've
been keeping from me.

221
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,471
Very well.

222
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,431
Great.

223
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,080
What's our first move?

224
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,631
Well, Pierce still needs
to cover his tracks,

225
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,230
so if I were him,
I'd be looking for a fall guy.

226
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,636
This was just found
at the crime scene.

227
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,916
I totally missed
the little bugger

228
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,276
in the first couple
of canvasses.

229
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,153
I mean, thank God
Pierce held off

230
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,317
on releasing the scene
until we did a third sweep.

231
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,317
We may have never found it.

232
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,670
Oh, I guarantee
you wouldn't have.

233
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,956
Did you find any DNA on it?

234
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,753
Yeah and we got a match.

235
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,395
A guy named Steve Chamberlain.

236
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,478
That's one of the men that
Charlotte was gonna prosecute.

237
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,030
A hedge fund manager
that was using a charity

238
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,991
to embezzle money.

239
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,680
Sounds exactly like
the kind of dirtbag

240
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,553
- who would do something this terrible.
- Hey, Ella,

241
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,956
there's something
that I need you to...

242
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,595
There's something that you should do.

243
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,790
Okay, so if they found this,

244
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,116
at the scene, there's probably
more evidence,

245
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,680
so have the team
do another sweep.

246
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,196
- You got it.
- We have a lead?

247
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,797
Yeah.

248
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,272
Uh, DNA at the scene points
to one of the criminals

249
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,960
that Charlotte
was gonna prosecute.

250
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,231
That's great.

251
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,195
Well, keep me posted.

252
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,629
Let me know if there's
anything you need.

253
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,035
Yeah, will do.

254
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,190
Espinoza.

255
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,311
Uh, yeah, Lieutenant?

256
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,074
Thought I told you to go home.

257
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,674
Yes, sir, you did.

258
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,757
Well, if I were you,
I would still be here, too.

259
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,276
If there's anything
you need...

260
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,394
I need... to catch the bastard
that killed Charlotte.

261
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,791
Good luck.

262
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,594
The improv's paying off.

263
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,031
Admirable work, Daniel.

264
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,436
For whatever good it does.

265
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,835
If we don't arrest
Pierce's fall guy,

266
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,315
he's gonna know we're onto him.

267
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,795
But if we do, then we lose
the time that we need

268
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,918
to prove that Pierce is really
the one who did it.

269
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,470
Maybe not.

270
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,032
Think Pierce has gone back
to his Sinnerman network?

271
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,072
It makes sense.
Pierce needs to move quickly,

272
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,555
and there are thousands
of people in Los Angeles

273
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,557
that owe him a favor.

274
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,717
Well, maybe one of them is
in Chamberlain's orbit.

275
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,559
If we can figure out
who owes Pierce the favor,

276
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,876
maybe we can get him
to flip on him.

277
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,400
It's a long shot, but...

278
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,671
Yeah, but it's the best
one we got so far, so...

279
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,360
Yeah.

280
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,349
I told you not to park
under that tree.

281
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,119
You need to
clean this crap.

282
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,357
LAPD.

283
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,471
Want to ask you some questions
about Charlotte Richards.

284
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,836
Yeah, sure.

285
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,594
Can we take this inside?

286
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,029
Nosy neighbors and all that.

287
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,120
Not sure
why you came all this way.

288
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,556
I'm not answering any questions
without my lawyer.

289
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,679
We're not here about
the embezzling case.

290
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,510
Charlotte Richards
was murdered.

291
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,558
What?

292
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,320
Yeah. And your DNA was found
at the scene of the crime.

293
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,199
I didn't murder her.

294
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,794
- We know.
- You got to listen to me.

295
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,117
I... You do?

296
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,800
You see, we think
you're being framed.

297
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,190
And we'd like your help
in trying

298
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,436
to find out who framed you.

299
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,353
Is this some weird
reverse psychology?

300
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,391
What's your angle?

301
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,833
Never mind.
I'm calling my lawyer.

302
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,594
If you do that,
we can't help you.

303
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,719
Sorry, but this good cop,
bad cop, sad cop thing

304
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,797
isn't working on me.

305
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,390
Besides, a cigarette butt
is pretty flimsy evidence.

306
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,272
He's right. A good frame job
would need more.

307
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,351
Like the murder weapon.

308
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,920
- Where would you hide it?
- Nowhere,

309
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,156
because I didn't murder her.

310
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,517
If you did,
where would you hide the gun?

311
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,154
- In my desk.
- What, that one?

312
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,073
I don't... yes.
That one.

313
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,397
You know, it's not gonna
be there, because I'm not a...

314
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,751
...murderer. W-Whoa.
That is not mine.

315
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,713
For the last time, we know.

316
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,149
Someone planted
this gun here.

317
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,510
We need to know who had access

318
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,989
to this area
in the last 12 hours.

319
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,596
- Oh, no.
- What?

320
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,320
Had a few friends over today,
have you?

321
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,832
Oh, just a hundred or so.

322
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,236
I think we made a real
breakthrough today, Simon.

323
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,231
Thanks.

324
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,352
A-And I know you're right,
Linda.

325
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,512
Not everyone's
out to get me.

326
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,673
Yeah. Okay. Good.

327
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,912
- Are you here to kill her?
- No, no!

328
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,676
That's exactly what someone
trying to kill her would say.

329
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,791
No. No, I...

330
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,354
Maze, he's a patient.

331
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,950
See you next week?

332
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,674
What the hell happened?!

333
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,636
Are you okay?

334
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,394
Yes! I'm fine.

335
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,031
Good.

336
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,717
All right, we need to figure out

337
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,400
who would get a favor
from The Sinnerman.

338
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,199
Well, you did bring along
your own master of favors.

339
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,993
I could suss out
who needed one the most.

340
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,237
Dude, we don't have time
to go person to person.

341
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,712
Pierce is gonna start wondering
where we are soon.

342
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:26,798
Yeah, you're right.

343
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,639
We need to narrow down
the list fast.

344
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,990
You know everybody here.

345
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,195
I mean, who would
have a dark secret

346
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,197
that they would
want erased?

347
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,159
Uh, everyone.

348
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,436
What? It's a charity event.

349
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,434
Ah, charity
is the perfect way

350
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,790
for criminals to launder
their images.

351
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,156
Donate a thousand dollars
to distract

352
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,396
from the million
you just filched.

353
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,670
He's not wrong.

354
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,595
That guy.
Sweatshop abuse.

355
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,837
Him? Insider trading.

356
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,279
Her? Stole the idea for
a company from her own sister.

357
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,834
So it could be anyone.

358
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,917
Everyone here is guilty.

359
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,396
Which means The Sinnerman's
not very good at what he does.

360
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,109
Should've left it to
the professionals, namely <i>moi.</i>

361
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,193
- Y-You're right.
- Well, thank you.

362
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,079
No, I mean he is good
at what he does.

363
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,430
If somebody made a deal
with The Sinnerman,

364
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,994
he's gonna make
their skeletons vanish.

365
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,634
And no one would know
about their crimes at all.

366
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,797
Which means we're not
looking for a criminal.

367
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,431
We're looking for somebody
as clean as can be.

368
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,311
Dan.

369
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,352
Dan.

370
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,991
Who hired you
to frame your boss?

371
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,429
What? What are you
talking about?

372
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,676
- Dan.
- You are innocent.

373
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,314
And that's a bad thing?

374
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,836
You're the only one who has
access to Chamberlain's office

375
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,110
and the only one
with no dirty laundry.

376
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,160
Now, the woman I loved is dead,
so if you don't start talking...

377
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,079
Daniel, Daniel!
Daniel, Daniel.

378
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,270
I understand your anger,

379
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,596
but perhaps a lighter touch

380
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,029
might help reveal
the truth faster.

381
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,516
I mean, after all, this
young man did ask for a favor

382
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,511
from The Sinnerman,

383
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,838
so you must've wanted something
very badly, didn't you?

384
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,754
Yeah. Tell me.

385
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,720
What is it you desired?

386
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,760
I wished I never sneezed.

387
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,073
You interrupted me
for a stupid parlor trick?

388
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,595
Dan, it's not a trick.

389
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,110
I-I don't know what
it is, but it works.

390
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,190
Calm down.

391
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,436
What happened
when you sneezed?

392
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,437
I...

393
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,310
I took my eyes off the road
for a second.

394
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,352
And... this...

395
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,835
this motorcycle
pulled in front of me

396
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,871
at just the wrong time.

397
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,590
So you killed a biker

398
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,792
and then found somebody
who could make it all disappear.

399
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,630
I heard about a guy
who gave out favors,

400
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,990
so I called him.

401
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,714
And the next morning I...

402
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,070
it was like it
never happened.

403
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,870
But it did happen.

404
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,396
No matter how much time
has passed,

405
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,035
every time I look in the mirror,
all I see is...

406
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,396
A monster.

407
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,512
And then this morning

408
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,796
he called in his favor.

409
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,113
How'd he contact you?
Would you recognize him?

410
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,470
I never saw anybody.

411
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,591
A burner phone showed up

412
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,677
at my doorstep this morning

413
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,475
and everything after was handled
through dead drops.

414
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,074
All right.
We're gonna need that phone.

415
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,431
Okay.

416
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,950
We're running out of time.

417
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,152
Okay, so then we buy more.
We bring Chamberlain in.

418
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,479
We let him lawyer up
so he doesn't talk.

419
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,393
And then what?
Pierce works with the pros.

420
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,279
There's a good chance there's
no evidence on the burner phone.

421
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,951
Well, perhaps it's time
we asked for some help.

422
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,274
Hey. I got your
text. What's up?

423
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,510
I need something from you.

424
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,230
Of course you do.

425
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,475
I do, too, actually.

426
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,277
That's not what I meant. I...

427
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,153
Hey. Hey.

428
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,679
You have been
through so much.

429
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,236
Okay?

430
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,514
You need to go home.

431
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,160
You need to take
care of you.

432
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,717
We got the guy.

433
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,151
That's just it.
I need you...

434
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,397
What's up?

435
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,754
I need you
to do me a favor.

436
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,917
Something you can't tell
anyone about.

437
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,753
Lopez, you want to
come in or what?

438
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,117
Uh...

439
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,357
Hey, boss.

440
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,317
What is it?

441
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,240
Dan gave something to me.

442
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,589
Asked me to examine it,

443
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,275
but told me not to tell anyone.

444
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,675
What is it?

445
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,030
A phone?

446
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,077
That's it?

447
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,636
Yeah. I mean, he...
honestly, he sounded

448
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,671
kind of crazy.

449
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,791
He was going on and on

450
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,879
about some frame job
or something.

451
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,517
Huh. Well, what all did he say?

452
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,949
Uh, not much more than that.

453
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,119
He-he claimed that
"people might be listening."

454
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,635
I know, it sounds insane.

455
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,599
I-I know he's not
in a great place.

456
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,634
I told him he should just
go home and get some sleep.

457
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,920
I'm-I'm really worried
about him.

458
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,192
It's okay. I'm glad you came
to me with this, Ella.

459
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,314
But I don't want Dan
to get into any trouble.

460
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,277
He's not in any trouble.
I promise.

461
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,677
Okay.

462
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,797
Yeah, it's me.

463
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,753
One of my officers is on to you.

464
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,231
I don't need excuses.

465
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,960
I just need you
to take care of it.

466
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,754
Hello, Pierce.

467
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,070
It's time for a reckoning.

468
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,437
What are you talking about?

469
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,194
I know you killed Charlotte.

470
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,918
So, why'd you do it, Piercy?

471
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,993
Why kill Charlotte?

472
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,799
I don't know what
this is about, Lucifer.

473
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,959
We caught the murderer.
I don't know why you think...

474
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,396
The detective isn't here,
which means

475
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,314
I'm invulnerable
and you're not, so...

476
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,951
sit...

477
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,516
down.

478
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,196
Or I'll make you.

479
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,638
Lucifer...

480
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,958
For every lie,
I will break a body part.

481
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,637
I didn't mean to kill Charlotte.

482
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,876
It was an accident.

483
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,514
I was trying to kill Amenadiel.

484
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,074
And that's supposed to spare
your life, is it?

485
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,993
You wanted my brother
dead instead?

486
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,356
It's the truth.

487
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,670
But why?

488
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,150
God took my mark away.

489
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,397
I thought killing his favorite
son might bring it back.

490
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,554
Did you, now?

491
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,357
You know, when I first
landed in Hell...

492
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,678
...I'd just led a rebellion
against dear old Dad.

493
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,676
I failed.

494
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,276
Everyone hated me for it.

495
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,433
Myself included,
I've come to realize.

496
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,479
I felt like a monster.

497
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,399
And then, when I looked
at my reflection,

498
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,954
there was my Devil face.

499
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,875
Your Father's punishment.

500
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,277
So I thought, but...

501
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,119
after speaking with a sneezy,
murderous driver today,

502
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,199
I realized
I felt like a monster

503
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,198
before I became one.

504
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,277
I think I gave myself that face.

505
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,837
You actually believe
Amenadiel's theory?

506
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,600
And what about your wings?

507
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,116
Well, I'd just
saved Mum, hadn't I?

508
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,837
And I'd decided to tell
the detective the truth.

509
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,397
I felt better about myself
than I had in...

510
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,635
well... ever.

511
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,111
Maybe so much so that,
deep down,

512
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,278
I felt like I wasn't
a monster anymore.

513
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,156
What does any of this
have to do with me?

514
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,111
My curse was lifted
when Chloe fell in love with me.

515
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,313
Yeah. You see...

516
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,200
I don't think
that's what happened.

517
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,157
You were willing
to sacrifice

518
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,317
the one thing you wanted
to protect someone else.

519
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,958
For the first time
in your miserable life, Cain,

520
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,629
you were selfless.

521
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,670
And maybe, deep down,

522
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,475
you felt that you
finally deserved

523
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,350
the mortality that
you so desperately desired.

524
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,957
You fell in love
with the detective, Pierce,

525
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,350
not the other way around.

526
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,399
She never loved you.

527
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,240
Oh, go ahead, hit me.

528
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,272
Yeah, be good to see you
break your hand.

529
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,314
You think you're not vulnerable
because Chloe's not here.

530
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,675
But guess what, you're
still very vulnerable.

531
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,679
Oh, please, do go on.
I like this desperate you.

532
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,109
You do have a weakness.

533
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,197
Mm.

534
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,591
You want to be good.

535
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,154
What?

536
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,917
Help! Help, I'm
being attacked!

537
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:30,758
What on earth
are you doing?

538
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,474
- Let go of me.
- Lucifer's trying to kill me!

539
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,040
No, no. What?
No. No, no, no, no.

540
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,794
Let go of me.
Let go of me!

541
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,912
Leave me alone!
I don't want to hurt you!

542
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,640
It's not me that you want!

543
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,719
Get off! Oh...

544
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,637
Get off of me!

545
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,634
So you just let him go.

546
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,190
You were supposed
to keep Pierce distracted,

547
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,631
not confront him
in the middle of the precinct.

548
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,600
I... overestimated
my abilities

549
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,830
and underestimated his.

550
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,759
It's not his fault. I mean,

551
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,832
I wish I'd had a chance to
give Pierce a piece of my mind.

552
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,235
Thank you, Ms. Lopez.

553
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,631
When Dan asked me
to give Pierce that phone,

554
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,479
and told me
the whole crazy theory,

555
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,037
I got to be honest, I had
a really hard time believing it.

556
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,277
Yeah, well, the fact that
you do, Ella, it means a lot.

557
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,833
Hey, we're O.G.

558
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,394
Okay, you ask me
to take a leap of faith,

559
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,795
I'm already jumping.

560
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,713
But, you guys,
when I handed him that phone,

561
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,389
that look in his eyes...

562
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,037
I just wanted to tear
his damn throat out right there.

563
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,153
Okay, so now what?

564
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,158
We have no idea
where Pierce has gone,

565
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,191
who's still loyal to him.

566
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,595
Hell, we can't even
go back to the precinct

567
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,230
to run this guy's fingerprints

568
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,760
to figure out
who the hell he is.

569
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,758
Pierce has completely
reinvented himself before.

570
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,916
He'll do it again.

571
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,231
Disappear forever.

572
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,794
Which means our
window is tight.

573
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,029
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling him.

574
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,034
- Chloe.
- Hey.

575
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,471
I-I just heard that
Lucifer attacked you?

576
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,200
Wha-What's going on?

577
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,396
What did Lucifer tell you?

578
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,829
That you're an immortal.

579
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,111
That, uh, you're Cain
from the Bible.

580
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,120
Just a bunch
of, uh, uh, crazy stuff.

581
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,994
It's all true.

582
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,560
Hey... Marcus...

583
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,316
are you okay?

584
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,397
I'm fine.

585
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,716
It's good to hear your voice.

586
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,917
Yeah, you, too.

587
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,079
Where are you?
I'm worried about you.

588
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,079
Lucifer's next to you,
isn't he?

589
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,511
Espinoza, too?

590
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,672
What? No.

591
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,753
You're a good liar,
but I know you, Chloe.

592
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,472
Yeah.

593
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,712
Yeah, they're here.

594
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,438
Ella, too,

595
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,199
and the guy
you sent to kill Dan.

596
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,318
Chloe, I can explain.

597
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,797
You know what, I don't believe
a word you say.

598
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,118
Was anything that happened
between us real, any of it?

599
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,276
I did love you.

600
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,675
I still love you.

601
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,156
Life was a curse
until I met you.

602
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,794
Since then,
I've done whatever it takes

603
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,110
to stay alive for you.

604
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,630
All right, well, I want you
to do something then.

605
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,835
I want you to turn yourself in.

606
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,590
It's not happening.

607
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,475
Okay, we've got your guy here,

608
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,239
and he is gonna crack.

609
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,636
He's not gonna say anything.

610
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,638
He knows I can get
to his sister.

611
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,190
Chloe, you need to know.

612
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,437
No, I want you to know.

613
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,998
One way or another, Pierce,
I am going to find you.

614
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,436
I doubt that.

615
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,230
It's okay.
It's okay.

616
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,796
How are you feeling?

617
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,991
I'm fine.

618
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,840
Maze, you need to rest.

619
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,234
No, I can't stay here.

620
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,509
Pierce is right.

621
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,556
Being on Earth...

622
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,432
around all these humans...

623
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,874
...all these emotions,
makes me weak.

624
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,800
You look like you
fought ten people

625
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,390
and ran a mile
to get here.

626
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,756
12 people.

627
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,559
Four miles.

628
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,195
My point is...

629
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,958
you did that... for me.

630
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,759
To save me.

631
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,640
Emotions...

632
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,519
emotions are hard.

633
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,953
But that's why
they make you strong.

634
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,476
And this is...

635
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,359
This is the strongest
I've ever seen you.

636
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,871
Linda, I'm...

637
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,560
You don't have to
say anything.

638
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,398
Your actions speak plenty.

639
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,551
Ah.

640
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,029
That's the thing.

641
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,391
Actions are easy for me.

642
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,152
That's why I need
to say it.

643
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,994
I'm sorry.

644
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,794
Me, too.

645
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,840
But I got to ask.

646
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,313
Is somebody really
trying to kill me?

647
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,271
Don't worry.

648
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,390
You're safe.

649
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,432
Everything's gonna be fine.

650
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,430
I miss Charlotte.

651
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,274
So do I, Ms. Lopez.

652
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,152
I can't believe
she's really gone.

653
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,954
And that Pierce would do
what he did.

654
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,791
I know,

655
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,793
God works in mysterious ways,

656
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,839
and bad things happen
for a reason.

657
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,829
But this many bad things,

658
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,996
I just...

659
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,639
I'm having a hard time
finding any reason.

660
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,030
Why would He do all this?

661
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,313
Well, I can't believe
I'm saying this,

662
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,870
but I don't actually think

663
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,639
it's my Father's fault.

664
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,000
See, all this time
I thought it was Him

665
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,430
pulling the strings.

666
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,000
I've started
to realize that

667
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,475
we are the responsible parties.

668
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,555
It's quite devious of Him,
if you think about it.

669
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,670
We've no one to blame
but ourselves.

670
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:00,991
Screw that.

671
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,516
I blame Pierce.

672
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,790
And, Big Guy?

673
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,877
You and I are
on rocky ground.

674
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,556
<i>We know about your sister.</i>

675
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,551
Yeah? Then you know why
I'm not talking.

676
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,873
If you cooperate,
we can protect her.

677
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,036
You can protect her?

678
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,832
I'm tied to a chair
in a penthouse

679
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,791
above a nightclub.

680
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,639
You, him,

681
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,229
you can't protect
anyone.

682
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,317
Where's your safe house?

683
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,836
The walk-in closet?

684
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,911
That's what I thought.

685
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,873
Chloe, can I have a second
alone with him, please?

686
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,239
Can I leave you alone with him?

687
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,717
Okay.

688
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,679
Oh, God, listen, save whatever
threats you think...

689
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,836
A corrupt cop.

690
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,272
What?

691
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,834
A corrupt cop.

692
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,719
That's what Pierce called me...

693
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,909
when we first met.

694
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,400
And it pissed me off
when he said it.

695
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,876
Well, you know what?

696
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,470
He was right.

697
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,080
I have stolen evidence.

698
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,834
I've had someone killed.

699
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,356
And I never regretted it
for a split second.

700
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,634
So if you're
wondering,

701
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,671
would I kill the guy who tried
to murder me in my sleep?

702
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,956
With the gun

703
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,598
that killed the woman I love?

704
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,360
What do you think the answer is?

705
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,477
My s... my sister,

706
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,400
Kelsey, she's...

707
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,235
all I care about...
the only thing.

708
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,193
So, if you can prove to me

709
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,280
that you can really... and I mean
really... protect her...

710
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,196
I'll tell you
whatever you want to know.

711
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,157
I... just...

712
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,920
I'll tell you
whatever you want to know.

713
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,910
His sister's address.

714
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,994
Once we can prove
she's safe,

715
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,115
he promised he'd give us
everything we need.

716
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,919
Okay, Lucifer and I will
go get her.

717
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,959
You guys, stay here,
keep an eye on him.

718
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,599
Right, the sister's loft
should be right up here.

719
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,797
All right.

720
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,791
Detective.

721
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,312
This is all my fault.

722
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,751
What? No, no, no, you can't
blame yourself for Pierce.

723
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,071
No, you were right.

724
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,396
You tried to warn me about him,

725
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,795
and I didn't listen to you.

726
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,640
But... although, who could
believe anything you say?

727
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,593
Angels, demons, immortal men.

728
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,957
Detective, I always
tell you the truth.

729
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:05,832
No.

730
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,155
You tell me <i>your</i> truth.

731
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,712
And I know

732
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,992
that all of these metaphors,
they're real for you.

733
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,671
But I think...

734
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,717
I think
humoring them

735
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,470
has just encouraged you,
and that's on me, but I'm done.

736
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,750
Detective.

737
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,469
No more metaphors.

738
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,751
No more "devil" talk.

739
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,634
I've told you before,

740
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,032
you may think that
that's what you are,

741
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,870
but... I don't see you that way.

742
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,237
Lately, I'm not sure
I do, either.

743
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:51,437
All right, well,
first things first.

744
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,075
- Right.
- Yeah.

745
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:53,912
Come on.

746
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:54,758
Okay.

747
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,996
Hello?

748
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,074
Kelsey, are you here?

749
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,076
Your brother sent us.

750
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,077
<i>Are you sure?</i>

751
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,640
Okay. All right, thanks.

752
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,478
What's going on?

753
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,034
I called in a favor
to Detroit PD.

754
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,640
Had them run
that dude's prints on the DL.

755
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,711
Uh-huh. And...?

756
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,360
He's an only child.

757
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,670
There is no sister.

758
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,957
So that means that they're
walking into a trap.

759
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,913
Something doesn't
feel right.

760
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,194
I wouldn't do that, Chloe.

761
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,270
You don't have to do this,
Pierce.

762
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,960
Yes, I do.

763
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,035
And normally, I would just
skip town and reinvent myself.

764
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,833
But this time, I can't.

765
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,440
Not before I kill Lucifer.

766
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,797
What?

767
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,480
- Why?
- Because I know

768
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,713
that he'll never
stop hunting me.

769
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,877
And I can't
afford to spend

770
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,037
the rest of my days
looking over my shoulder.

771
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,640
But you don't
have to die, Chloe.

772
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,751
Step away from him.

773
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,191
Detective, for once,
I agree with this imbecile.

774
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,111
Step aside.

775
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,158
No.

776
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,231
Detective.

777
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,430
Chloe.

778
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,996
I believed everything you said,

779
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,196
Marcus.

780
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,994
That you loved me.

781
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,319
That you did all of this for me.

782
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,714
Which is why I know

783
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,197
that you won't shoot.

784
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,872
You made me realize
that life is worth living.

785
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,635
And I will do anything
to stay alive.

786
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,759
And if you get
in the way of that...

787
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,670
Okay.

788
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,877
I believe you.

789
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,440
I don't want to die.

790
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,069
And I can't.

791
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,515
Not without stopping you.

792
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,030
No! No! Detective!

793
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:05,918
What?

794
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,150
No, no, no, no, no, no.

795
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,714
This... this can't happen.

796
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,112
This...

797
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,753
Finish it. Finish it!

798
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,597
No!

799
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,237
What happened?

800
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,709
You're safe.

801
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,550
That's all that matters.

802
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,760
We need to find Pierce.

803
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,038
I guess it's just you
and me now.

804
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:38,958
Dan?

805
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,514
Hey, Chloe, uh, it's a trap.

806
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,995
Dan, I-I know.

807
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,111
I know.

808
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,875
We had to find out the hard way.

809
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,634
Pierce, he tried to kill us.

810
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,030
What? Are you okay?

811
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,509
- Yeah, I am.
- Is she okay?

812
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,429
I-I don't know how,

813
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,080
but I am.

814
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,514
Or maybe I do know.

815
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,316
Maybe I've been avoiding
the biggest truth this whole...

816
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,511
I have to go.

817
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,154
Chloe, don't go in there
without backup.

818
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,429
There's no point.

819
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,798
The detective's
a safe distance away now.

820
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,597
Ah, that's good.

821
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,790
I came prepared.

822
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,589
As I recall...

823
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,514
...this can kill you
pretty well.

824
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,279
A fair fight it is, then, Cain.

825
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,873
Someone's been working out.

826
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,715
I promised you...

827
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,037
...that I would find a way
to kill you.

828
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,194
I am a Devil of my word.

829
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,675
Is Chloe okay?

830
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,715
She's fine.

831
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,194
No thanks to you.

832
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,871
Now that I know I'm dying,

833
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,673
I don't know
what I was so afraid of.

834
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,436
I'm going to Heaven.

835
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,000
You really believe that.

836
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,996
I told you, Lucifer, I don't
regret anything I've done.

837
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,832
Yes, but that was before
you killed Charlotte Richards.

838
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:57,917
No.

839
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,755
No, that was an accident.

840
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,320
Well, you pulled
the trigger.

841
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,037
You ended her life.

842
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,913
You chose to kill her.

843
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,116
Oh...

844
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,596
Deep down,

845
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,476
you know you're a monster.

846
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,033
And that you belong in Hell,

847
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:17,314
where you will torture yourself
with that truth for eternity.

848
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,236
'Cause no matter what
you tell yourself,

849
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,596
you can't outrun
what you've done.

850
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,879
What you truly are.

851
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,874
And neither can you.

852
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:42,718
Lucifer.

853
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,591
Lucifer.

854
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,960
It's all true.

855
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,436
Detective?

856
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,512
It's all true.
