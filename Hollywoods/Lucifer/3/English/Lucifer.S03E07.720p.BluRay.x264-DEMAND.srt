1
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,430
Welcome back to the land
of the living, Mr. Getty.

2
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,876
What...?

3
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,830
What happened?

4
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,474
Just a little brush with death.

5
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,479
You had us worried there
for a while.

6
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:38,912
Oh.

7
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,156
Is my wife here?

8
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,316
No.

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,516
I'm sorry, you haven't
had any visitors.

10
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,876
Well...

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,271
we have been having
some trouble lately.

12
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,035
But you know what?

13
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,840
Second chance on life.

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,751
Maybe it's not too late
to turn things around.

15
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,796
No, you wouldn't.

16
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,950
No.

17
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,275
So, sorry to shag and run,
darling, but, uh,

18
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,036
I'll see you
next time.

19
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,637
All right.

20
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,399
Ah. Lovely.

21
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,553
Who the hell
does he think he is?

22
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,110
Lucifer Morningstar.

23
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,272
You're serious?
That's his name?

24
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,399
What kind of idiot
calls himself that?

25
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,752
The kind who owns this place.

26
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,877
Don't think I haven't noticed
you watching me.

27
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,920
I know what
this is about.

28
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,557
You do?

29
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,751
Yes,

30
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,595
and the answer is no.

31
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,790
I will not sleep with you.

32
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,438
Excuse me?

33
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,632
It's not because you're a man.
It's just because...

34
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,400
Well, I don't
find you attractive.

35
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,912
But maybe I could

36
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,039
introduce you to someone more,
you know, your league?

37
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,594
There's a chubby fellow
over there.

38
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,439
I'm sure he wouldn't mind giving
you a reach-around or something.

39
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,075
I'm married... to a woman,
thank you very much.

40
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,873
Oh. Does she know you're gay?

41
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,196
My wife,

42
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,717
who's the smartest
and funniest person I ever met,

43
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,111
and the only woman
that I've ever loved,

44
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,960
is sleeping with another man.

45
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,430
A sleazy, arrogant,
womanizing piece of garbage.

46
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,475
Well, then, why are you wasting
time trying to pick me up?

47
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,830
You should be punishing him.

48
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,269
Oh, don't worry.
I'm going to.

49
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,960
Oh, are you? Great.

50
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,833
What are you gonna do,
spoons to the eyes?

51
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,156
Ants inside his urethra?

52
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,192
A Urethra Franklin,
as I like to call it.

53
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,198
I think I'm just gonna
punch him in the face.

54
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,473
Well, that's not enough
for someone who stole your wife.

55
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,991
- You're right.
- Yeah.

56
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,919
You should destroy him.

57
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,631
Tear his very life apart
piece by piece.

58
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,960
And normally,
I'd help you do that,

59
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,516
but I've picked up a new hobby
recently. Detective!

60
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,917
Detective?

61
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,316
Yes. LAPD,
and I'm a consultant.

62
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,631
You? You work with the police?

63
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,150
Started a couple of weeks ago.
It's quite fun, actually.

64
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,794
Hey, you know,
I've been trying to reach you.

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,117
Detective, meet
my new friend. Uh...

66
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,675
- Uh, Reese.
- Hi.

67
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,679
Ah. Owner of the pieces.

68
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,518
Good to meet you.

69
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,756
Uh, sorry to interrupt,
but I need

70
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,192
my consultant to sober up
and join me at a crime scene.

71
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,756
Oh, sounds lovely. All right.

72
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,917
Nice meeting you.

73
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,832
Yes. Oh.

74
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,354
Good luck with the punishing.

75
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,395
<i>Hey, boss, I got something.</i>

76
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,035
Sleeping in your
office again?

77
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,999
No, I'm working
on my new story.

78
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,350
It's about
a shady nightclub owner.

79
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,155
My top investigative
reporter wants me to approve a piece

80
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,397
about overpriced booze
and go-go dancers?

81
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,915
No, no, it's a con man.

82
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,640
On paper, didn't even exist
five years ago.

83
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,599
Tells everyone
he's the Devil.

84
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,678
So he's a weirdo.
I don't see a story.

85
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,599
He's consulting for the LAPD.

86
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,873
I've got a bad feeling
this guy's up to no good.

87
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,600
Remember the last time
I had a bad feeling?

88
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,796
How can I forget your Pulitzer

89
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,070
when you won't stop
reminding me?

90
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,754
This son of a bitch
is hiding something.

91
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,000
Who he is,
how he's exploiting the police.

92
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,797
Whatever it is, the people
deserve to know the truth.

93
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,030
Bringing this guy down,

94
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,630
there wouldn't be a personal
reason behind it, would there?

95
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,077
No. Of course not.

96
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,151
Lucifer!

97
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,991
Reese. Excuse me.

98
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,756
What are you
doing here?

99
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,679
Have you come to tell me about
the punishment you delivered?

100
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,758
Probably not best to go into
detail in a police station.

101
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,431
No. After we met last night,
I realized how...

102
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,910
fascinating you are.

103
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,713
Oh, well, I can't
argue with that.

104
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,718
I'm a journalist
for the <i>LA Telegraph.</i>

105
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,640
So I pitched my editor, and she
said I could do a piece on you.

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,357
No. What, an entire
article dedicated to me?

107
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,789
Right. Well, let's
start with a talk.

108
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,838
Gosh, this'll be fun.

109
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,994
Can you tell me
about this guy, Lucifer?

110
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,000
Yeah, he calls himself
"the Devil."

111
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,430
He helped me out
with some gambling debts.

112
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,638
Saved my life.

113
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,990
Five years ago?

114
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,836
I heard he was somewhere
terrible down south.

115
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,110
He introduced me to my husband.

116
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,111
And my horse.

117
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,591
Maybe Florida?

118
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,878
It's weird, but this is L.A.

119
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,270
I don't know what to tell you.
I love the guy.

120
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,670
Just love that guy.

121
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,156
Everyone here
just loves Lucifer.

122
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,511
I don't like Lucifer.

123
00:05:59,160 --> 00:05:59,752
Really?

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,116
For starters,

125
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,675
someone's been
stealing my pudding.

126
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,515
And I don't think
it's a coincidence

127
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,035
that it all started
when he showed up.

128
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,152
No.

129
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,317
And I'm not exactly in love
with the idea of my wife

130
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,712
putting herself in danger
just so some club owner

131
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,070
can have fun playing cop.

132
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,476
You and Detective Decker
are married?

133
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,791
We're separated.

134
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,638
Oh, but still,

135
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,717
that's got to be hard
watching them

136
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,990
frolic around in front of you.

137
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,480
I wouldn't say "frolic."

138
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,595
Happy to keep this
off the record.

139
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,200
Separated is not divorced.
There's still time.

140
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,553
Excuse me. Hi.

141
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,750
Uh, I know you.

142
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,990
Aren't you the
guy from Lux?

143
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,872
Reese Getty,
<i>LA Telegraph.</i>

144
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,956
I'm here to write a story
about you and Lucifer.

145
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,071
Oh, right.

146
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,756
"Former B-movie Actress
Turned Detective

147
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,600
Works With a Whack-Job
Consultant."

148
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,637
Sounds about right.

149
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,912
Yeah. No thanks.

150
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,311
Detective Chloe Decker.
I did my research.

151
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,156
<i>Hot Tub High School,</i>
your dad, I get it.

152
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,637
You don't like the press.

153
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,876
I don't have time for this.

154
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,800
I have work to do that actually
contributes to society.

155
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,036
I hate to be the one
to break it to you,

156
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,800
but your lieutenant
and my editor are like this.

157
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,673
I've been assigned to ride along
with you, Detective.

158
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,440
So we can either
make this a pleasant experience,

159
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,670
or we can do it the hard way.

160
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,590
I'll pick the hard way.

161
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,913
So, you just started
showing up at crime scenes,

162
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,793
and eventually,
she let you work with her?

163
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,480
Uh, more or less.

164
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,192
Yeah. Um, excuse us.

165
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,993
No, no, no, just...
I'll stay out of your way.

166
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,356
Just pretend
I'm not here.

167
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,591
Here you go.

168
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,230
What am I supposed
to do with these?

169
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,951
Wear them... like
you always do.

170
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,560
- Oh, right, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

171
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,876
- I don't.
- Hi.

172
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,514
Our victim's name
is Poppy Parker.

173
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,518
She owns an organic
cosmetics line.

174
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,792
Sort of a local celebrity
for all-natural skin care.

175
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,555
And, uh, what are all these?

176
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,071
These are boobs.
Yes, I'd know them anywhere.

177
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,880
C-cups to be precise.

178
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,837
Oh, look at these.

179
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,797
Please don't...

180
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,636
juggle the evidence, Lucifer.

181
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,719
But it's fine if he does,
'cause,

182
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,189
you know,
they've already been processed.

183
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,198
They're called
"fun bags" for a reason.

184
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,198
Actually, this one is
a calf implant, so you should

185
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,516
have that,
Detective Douche.

186
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,433
Looks like
you've been skipping leg day.

187
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,195
Yeah, they're very, um,
low quality, actually.

188
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,277
More outdated

189
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,477
than Dan's flip phone.

190
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,636
Don't think any

191
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,194
surgeon in L.A. would use these.

192
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,113
Hmm. Okay.
We'll look into it.

193
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,720
Lucifer, he does this.

194
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,754
He notices things
that normal people are too...

195
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,713
normal to notice,

196
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,990
but it, uh,

197
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,794
has a tendency of paying off.

198
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,917
It does.

199
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,997
Why would he do this

200
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,475
to someone
who values natural beauty?

201
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,632
To punish her?

202
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,559
Well, that is
a very good question, Daniel,

203
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,274
but as an expert in punishment,

204
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,197
because I'm the Devil...

205
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,993
- Hmm.
- ...this isn't punishment.

206
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,838
This looks like

207
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,032
someone making a statement.

208
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,393
Well, maybe you're right.

209
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,030
Needle mark on the lip,

210
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,154
bruising around the injection.
This wasn't postmortem.

211
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,000
Poppy wasn't as all-natural as
she wanted everyone to believe.

212
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,276
She's a fraud.

213
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,878
Someone wanted

214
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,197
to reveal that the people
around her can't trust her.

215
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,436
Ah.

216
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,793
If that's the case,
I've seen this before.

217
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,079
Oh, very good.
Go, Reese Lightning.

218
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,432
So, Daniel Moore, vegan chef.

219
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,154
Curiously found with
raw meat in his mouth.

220
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,320
Ah. So vegans can't enjoy
a healthy sex life?

221
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:27,957
Tough crowd.

222
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,879
Turns out, he
owns a cattle ranch

223
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,197
in Montana, and the
environmentalist who was found

224
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,040
drowned in jet fuel, he
actually owned a private plane.

225
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,800
So, someone's killing
charlatans. Ah.

226
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,990
The worst kind of scum.

227
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,111
Next to boy bands.

228
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,800
All three victims
had trace amounts of

229
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,753
the exact same poison
in their system.

230
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,553
Same profile, same M.O.

231
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,910
This is a serial killer.

232
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,954
Yes. The Completely Justified
Killer of Phonies.

233
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,880
If that's what you name him,
I want credit.

234
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,910
The first scene was
found over a month ago.

235
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,758
Mm-hmm.

236
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,111
The environmentalist,
a week ago.

237
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,751
And Poppy here was found
just a few days later.

238
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,391
I think the killer is
becoming more obsessed.

239
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,239
He's accelerating
his timeline.

240
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,117
We have to catch this guy
before anyone else dies.

241
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,800
Why does Lucifer work with you?

242
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,150
I told you, it's an...

243
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,635
unconventional partnership,
and it just...

244
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,757
That's not it.

245
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,356
What's he get out of it?

246
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,160
You'll have to ask him.

247
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,357
Hi, hon.

248
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,479
I know you've been avoiding me.

249
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,080
I mean, things have
been... off lately.

250
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,516
But I want to try
and turn things around.

251
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,311
Can we talk?

252
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,231
I miss you.

253
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,358
Leave Lucifer Morningstar alone.

254
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,154
Or you'll be too dead
to regret it.

255
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,800
I'm onto something, aren't I?

256
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,476
You can't scare me off.

257
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,114
I've been threatened
by worse than you.

258
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,800
I guarantee you haven't.

259
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,871
Oh, Mr. Getty.

260
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,400
I need you to look up
this address.

261
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,071
Something shady

262
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,033
- going on here.
- O-Okay, but there's, uh...

263
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,720
Got to be a drug den,
human trafficking...

264
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,400
Mr. Getty, your wife's
in your office.

265
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,876
Really?

266
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,236
My wife?

267
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,392
How do I look?

268
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,556
Uh...

269
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,876
Reese.

270
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,920
We need to talk.

271
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,557
Linda.

272
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,600
You look... wow.

273
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,356
We should go to dinner.

274
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,679
Our favorite Italian
place is still open.

275
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,552
I'll make reservations.

276
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,918
Reese, why are people in your
office calling me your wife?

277
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,311
Because you are my wife.

278
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,836
No. We're separated.

279
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,993
It's been two years.

280
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,000
That's actually why I'm here.

281
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,239
I have been more
than patient, but it's time.

282
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,714
Sign the divorce papers, please.

283
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,758
Is this because
you're seeing someone else?

284
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,630
No. No, this isn't because
I'm seeing someone, Reese.

285
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,595
You can't keep leaving me
voicemails like that.

286
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,394
Things are not "off lately,"
things are over.

287
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,469
You need to move on.

288
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,916
I can't move on.

289
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,478
Don't you know
how much I love you?

290
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,310
You never give up.

291
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,870
It's one of the reasons
I fell in love with you.

292
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,360
But that was a long time ago.

293
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,755
Not that long ago.

294
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,519
This is classic denial.

295
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,040
It's a self-defense mechanism
that you...

296
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,475
Don't analyze me, Linda.

297
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,037
Sorry.

298
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,470
We're over.

299
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,035
Sign them.

300
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,438
I'm working on something,
and I need a little more time.

301
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,758
Why? Nothing you're working on
is gonna change anything.

302
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,872
24 hours, that's all
I'm asking for.

303
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,515
Okay, if I do...

304
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,959
you'll finally sign the papers?

305
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,671
I promise.

306
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,799
Hey. Did you find anything
about that address yet?

307
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,599
It's a known hot spot
for trading stolen goods.

308
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,029
I knew he was up to something.

309
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,515
Fencing? Smuggling? Or worse?

310
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,915
Well, I can do some research
on the building.

311
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,349
No, I need proof right now.

312
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,110
Lucifer's duffel bag.

313
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,396
I need to get it.

314
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,194
Another piano?

315
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,230
What the...?

316
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,191
Uh, uh, don't worry.

317
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,556
I'm gonna get you out of here.

318
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,755
Well, hello.

319
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,551
What the hell are you
doing here?

320
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,480
Well, it appears I've caught you
sneaking into my penthouse.

321
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,592
So perhaps you should
answer that question.

322
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,794
What story are you really
looking for, reporter?

323
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,952
I'm gonna expose you
for the fraud you are.

324
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,991
And save this woman.

325
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,231
Don't you try and stop me.

326
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,075
I won't. She
might, though.

327
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,349
Who is this guy, Lucifer?

328
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,994
He doesn't seem very fun.

329
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,793
You're not tied up
against your will?

330
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,919
Um, no.

331
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,270
I'm pretty into this.

332
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,994
At least I was
until you got here.

333
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,751
All right, that
doesn't matter.

334
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,800
I know I'm onto something.

335
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,640
Otherwise, why would you send
that crazy ninja woman after me?

336
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,957
Crazy ninja wom... oh, Maze?

337
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,230
No, I didn't send her.

338
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,472
She's just a tad
overprotective, that's all.

339
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,678
Demon bartenders,
you know how they can be.

340
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,599
What about that pile of cash
I saw you give that cop?

341
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,359
Yes, to buy his duffel bag.

342
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,960
Hard to find
quality leather

343
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,156
with such tensile strength.

344
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,111
The bag.

345
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,790
That's right.

346
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,952
This will prove everything.

347
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,150
What is this?

348
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,595
Are these sex toys?

349
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,156
Edible sex toys,

350
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:32,998
to be precise.

351
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,475
Not exactly FDA approved,

352
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,677
so I had to sneak
the delicious things

353
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,836
through customs.

354
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,474
How could I be so wrong?

355
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,320
About so many things?

356
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,193
Look, I know why
you're upset.

357
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,958
You thought you had a nice,
juicy scoop for your paper.

358
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,470
And I don't blame you.
You're just doing your job.

359
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,715
Unfortunately for you,
the only juicy thing here

360
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,957
is the, uh...
Watermelon Willies.

361
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,235
They're pretty good.
You should try one.

362
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,238
- Mm.
- I'm allergic to watermelon.

363
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,037
Oh. Look, why don't
you come with me?

364
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,550
The detective just called
with some sort of lead.

365
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,792
I always find
catching a killer cheers me up.

366
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,157
I mean, I was gonna
do Veronica first, but...

367
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,550
you don't mind waiting,
do you, darling?

368
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,030
- Not at all.
- Good.

369
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,117
Come on.

370
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,351
Excuse me.

371
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,710
Do you mind?

372
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,990
Thank you.

373
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,800
<i>You were right
about the implants.</i>

374
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,035
They were pulled from the market
years ago due to rupturing.

375
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,512
Oh, a moment of silence for all
those poor, mishandled breasts.

376
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,631
They're illegal
to sell anywhere,

377
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,638
but we pulled a
partial serial number

378
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,320
that pointed to a
plastic surgeon's office

379
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,636
in Beverly Hills.

380
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,472
Wait, you, Scarface?

381
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,872
You resent your clients,
don't you?

382
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,477
- I don't...
- You want them to suffer.

383
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,632
I do.

384
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,234
I want them all to suffer.

385
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,955
<i>Good work on the case.</i>

386
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,720
Realizing
that his scar

387
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,798
made him resent other
people around him...

388
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,877
that was good.

389
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,956
<i>Good detective work.</i>

390
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,793
Reese, you okay?

391
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,431
Reese.

392
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,911
You were right.

393
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,637
About?

394
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,711
I wanted to write a piece that
showed that your partnership

395
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,354
was a dangerous joke.

396
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,359
That Lucifer was a fraud.

397
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,709
But the truth is

398
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,992
he's just frustratingly,
annoyingly...

399
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,756
a charming guy.

400
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,671
And you and him...

401
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,709
you two work
well together.

402
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,034
There's no story here.

403
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,754
I'm just gonna drop it.

404
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,679
Is this some weird
journalist tactic

405
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,200
to get me to
lower my guard?

406
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,117
I wish.

407
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,836
No, this is just me
getting out of the way,

408
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,156
so you can do your job.

409
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,994
Catch more killers.

410
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,078
Unfortunately,
Barry's not our killer.

411
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,313
He sold expired
medical goods

412
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,995
from the office,
including some tainted Botox

413
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,515
that poisoned a few people.

414
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,551
And although

415
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,830
he'll spend a very
long time in jail,

416
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,632
he's not our guy.

417
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,513
But if he sold supplies
to the killer,

418
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,120
he should
know something.

419
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,397
Well, he wouldn't give us
any information on the buyer.

420
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,432
Probably scared, but
we'll get it out of him.

421
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,275
Detective, the lieutenant's
asking for you.

422
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,357
Okay.

423
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,357
Uh, excuse me.

424
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,000
Be right back.

425
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,356
Thank you.

426
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,749
Right.

427
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,758
Now the detective's gone,
let's have a chat.

428
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,519
Just the two
of us, shall we?

429
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,313
Look, I don't
know anything, okay?

430
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,319
Yes, yes, you plead ignorance,

431
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,279
and then we sweat you until
you finally give us a name.

432
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,079
I'm sorry, I don't
have time for that.

433
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,118
I've got a lovely lady
tied up back at my place.

434
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,794
So I'd like to speed things up.

435
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:45,957
Listen, listen, man,

436
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,759
I... wait...

437
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,394
Please stop! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

438
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,477
I don't know his name!

439
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,512
I only know his,
his username, okay?!

440
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,360
"TruthDog21"!

441
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,552
Please! Stop!

442
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,872
Oh, oh!

443
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,391
Oh.

444
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,916
Oh...

445
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,712
You have to stop seeing
Lucifer Morningstar.

446
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,631
How did you get that name?

447
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,360
- Uh...
- Okay, invading my privacy

448
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,471
is one thing,

449
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,830
but if you're stalking
my clients...

450
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,110
I'm not stalking him.

451
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,920
I was working on a story
with him.

452
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,272
Oh, okay, so you just happened
to be working on a story

453
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,231
with Lucifer.

454
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,840
Okay, I know
this sounds crazy, it...

455
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,357
He's the Devil.

456
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,916
And I-I don't
mean in-in a,

457
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,236
in a douchebag,
club-owning kind of way.

458
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,391
I mean...

459
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,876
he's the actual Devil.

460
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,391
Yes, Lucifer is insistent
on this Devil persona.

461
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,080
No, he isn't some patient.

462
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,357
That's just a ploy that
he used to seduce you.

463
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,833
Okay, so that's
what this is about.

464
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,480
It is none of
your business

465
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,670
who I sleep with.

466
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,519
It is if it's Satan himself.

467
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,110
I don't think you've understood
exactly what it is you're doing.

468
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,710
Oh, I know exactly
what I'm doing.

469
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,960
I'm enjoying myself with someone

470
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,072
who doesn't make me
feel trapped.

471
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,633
Lucifer is someone who is

472
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,832
completely present
in the moment.

473
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,792
Who gives me 100%
of his attention.

474
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,636
And doesn't demand
anything from me.

475
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,275
I guess if you want
to vilify him

476
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,476
and call him the Devil...

477
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,636
No, he is the Devil.

478
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,193
But being with him

479
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,034
is the most liberating
experience of my life.

480
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,750
I see, he's-he's got you
under some sort of spell.

481
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,874
You know, I've been
incredibly patient with you,

482
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,075
because I still care about you,

483
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,316
still worry about you.

484
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,549
But I just can't take it
anymore.

485
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,792
Okay, if I can come up with
proof that he is the Devil...

486
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,952
Sign the papers!

487
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,997
You've got a lot
you need to figure out, Reese.

488
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,596
You're right.

489
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,036
I do.

490
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,158
Reese?

491
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,589
It's Detective Decker.

492
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,393
We could really
use your help.

493
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,716
How can I help you, Detective?

494
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,877
Shower and a shave,
maybe.

495
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,640
We're here about the serial
killer case from last year.

496
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,870
I thought
the killer went dormant.

497
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,831
He has,

498
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,635
but we're still investigating
the case, and we've had a break.

499
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,671
All the victims were

500
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,394
local celebrities
who were featured

501
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,670
in the <i>Telegraph's</i> style section.

502
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,109
You think he read the article?

503
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,874
And we hope he commented
on them. We have a handle

504
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,992
we think he used, TruthDog21.

505
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,800
- Well, the comments are public. You can search them.
- We have.

506
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,600
We didn't find anything,
but we want...

507
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,598
But I was complaining
to the detective

508
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,632
about some posts of mine
that have been removed

509
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,515
from a web site for roosters
of award-winning size.

510
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,473
You see, I was
posting pictures of my...

511
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,511
Okay.

512
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,271
Okay.

513
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,319
Does your paper archive
redacted comments?

514
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,910
Uh, anything that's threatening
or violent.

515
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,110
Or of award-winning size.

516
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,879
Uh, yeah, sure.

517
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,879
Just give the information
to my assistant.

518
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,477
He'll gather the info.
It might take a day or two.

519
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,189
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

520
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,514
You still haven't
destroyed him, have you?

521
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,837
Excuse me?

522
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,952
That sleazy piece of garbage

523
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,594
who was sleeping
with your wife.

524
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,351
No.

525
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,118
I'm starting to think

526
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,199
that he might be undestroyable.

527
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,356
Well, perhaps you're not

528
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,472
thinking outside the box
enough, Reesey.

529
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,353
Don't be afraid to
take a big swing.

530
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,829
It can be therapeutic.

531
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,520
Oh, speaking of...

532
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,394
I'm late
for my own therapy. Again.

533
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,711
She's gonna kill me.

534
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,198
She said that was
a ridiculous idea...

535
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,160
- Linda.
- Reese.

536
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,113
What, you know him as well?

537
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,558
- My ex-husband, Reese...
- Linda.

538
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,079
- Stay back.
- Your ex-husband?

539
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,509
So we're tunnel buddies.

540
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,557
Hey.

541
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,279
You realize what
you just did?

542
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,152
You just ruined
a perfectly good Burberry.

543
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,079
- What kind of monster are you?
- See?

544
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,749
- He's the Devil! I told you.
- Y-You tried to kill him.

545
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,156
Yeah, but I didn't.
He's invincible because he's the Devil.

546
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,629
- See? There's your proof.
- Reese...

547
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,320
You're lucky the detective
isn't here.

548
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,874
You'd be cleaning my blood
out of the couch.

549
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,355
Put the gun down, Reese.

550
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,392
Right, I don't need it anymore.
Look, I...

551
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,912
I know it's a lot to process,

552
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,271
but you've got to believe me.

553
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,119
Reese, I know he's the Devil.

554
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,592
What?

555
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,437
You... you... you do?

556
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,916
Is this what you were trying to
tell me all those months ago?

557
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,870
I saw his real face.

558
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,516
If you see it,
then you'll know.

559
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,830
I have seen it.

560
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,917
And I know.

561
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,518
I know

562
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,433
- how unsettling it can be.
- Yes.

563
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,909
And if you're
this unsettled by me,

564
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,997
I'd hate to see
what you're gonna do

565
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,077
to the scoundrel who's
been sleeping

566
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,316
with your wife.

567
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,436
I'm so sorry.

568
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,677
I didn't realize
what you were going through.

569
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,160
I didn't know the truth,

570
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,913
and I didn't think
you did either.

571
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,554
But you know now.

572
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,836
And you're still seeing him?

573
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,633
Only professionally, Reese,

574
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,956
much to my disappointment.

575
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,273
When I first learned
who he really was, it...

576
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,630
it-it turned my
world upside down.

577
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,395
But he's not
what you think.

578
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,477
He's the Devil!

579
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,909
Oh, it's not like I've
hidden that fact.

580
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,077
- He's evil incarnate!
- No.

581
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,469
No, he's a good man.

582
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,069
He's my friend.

583
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,560
All this time I've been...

584
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,831
trying to prove to you
who he really is.

585
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,518
And not only

586
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,154
did you already know...

587
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,351
you didn't care.

588
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,596
Sit down, Reese, let's
talk this through.

589
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,120
- No, no.
- Please, Reese.

590
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,709
Your assistant left
your redacted comments research

591
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,360
on my desk.

592
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,472
Are you still working on
this nightclub owner thing?

593
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,153
He's not just
a nightclub owner.

594
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,034
So do you have a story for me,
something I can actually print,

595
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,276
or just arts and crafts?

596
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,351
This has to stop.

597
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,274
- Now.
- I can't.

598
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,191
I can't let this guy win.

599
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,238
You have filed, <i>barely,</i>

600
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,358
a dozen other stories
this year.

601
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,358
And you have nothing to show
for all this work.

602
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,438
Reese!

603
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,872
This guy has won.

604
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,559
I'm telling you this
as your friend.

605
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,037
If you don't

606
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,436
let this go, it's going to be
the end of your career.

607
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,880
<i>You're lucky
the detective isn't here.</i>

608
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,594
<i>You'd be cleaning mz blood
out of the couch.</i>

609
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,471
- Alvin Kapitski?
- Yeah.

610
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,558
Registered on the
<i>LA Telegraph</i> web site

611
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,240
as "TruthDog21"?

612
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,840
I wanted to ask you
a few questions

613
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,639
about some comments
that you posted

614
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,470
on some stories we ran
about Poppy Parker

615
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,431
and Daniel Moore.

616
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,790
Okay.

617
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,430
Okay.

618
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,440
I knew this day would come.

619
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,110
I'll surrender quietly.

620
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,390
Oh, no.

621
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,230
I'm not a cop.

622
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:38,997
I'm a reporter.

623
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,990
I just want to
talk to you.

624
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,198
You're here to
do a story on me?

625
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,553
Well, my job is to
dig up the truth.

626
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,230
Expose people for
who they really are.

627
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,840
And once I saw your work,

628
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,794
I-I realized that

629
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,032
- you were just doing the same thing.
- Yeah.

630
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,560
Yeah, I was.

631
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,234
I'm back on my meds now.

632
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,229
I'm trying to be good.
It's hard, but I'm trying.

633
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,033
- I'm trying, I'm trying.
- I get it.

634
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,957
It's just, I met this guy

635
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,116
recently.

636
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,356
Biggest fraud
I'd ever encountered.

637
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,472
Yeah?

638
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,029
I tried to expose him,

639
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,719
show everybody the liar
that he really is.

640
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,391
What happened?

641
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,357
He won.

642
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,670
They always do,
don't they?

643
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,159
Unless someone does something.

644
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,910
What's his name?

645
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,471
Hi.

646
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,555
- Thanks for coming.
- Hey,

647
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,753
you're helping me,
so thanks.

648
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,838
Although I have no idea
why we had to meet here.

649
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,157
Those them?

650
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,990
Yeah, uh,

651
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,114
all the redacted
comments.

652
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,954
Uh, but first,

653
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,674
I never did get
to interview you.

654
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,479
You know, you really
had me fooled.

655
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,757
Thought you were different.

656
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,119
Fine, ask away.

657
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,993
What do you think
Lucifer gets

658
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,720
out of this partnership?

659
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,596
You already asked me that.

660
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,400
Uh, but you never answered.

661
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,599
Um... I think,

662
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,990
a long time ago,

663
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,634
somebody wronged Lucifer.

664
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,360
I think he avoided
dealing with it,

665
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,960
and he hides

666
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,799
behind the partying

667
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,038
and the women and the drinking,
and who knows what else.

668
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,994
And with the LAPD,

669
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,476
working on each case,
it gives him an opportunity

670
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,632
to right those wrongs,
to fight back.

671
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,593
Oh.

672
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,117
You think that's funny?

673
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,120
Uh, no, no.
I'm sorry.

674
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,680
I just think, uh,

675
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,800
you give him more credit

676
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,150
than he deserves.

677
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,589
Well, I don't think
you give him enough.

678
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,755
You may be right.

679
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,155
Thanks, Detective.

680
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,830
Um...

681
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,791
these, uh...

682
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,036
these look incomplete.

683
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,957
Help! Help, help!

684
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,992
- Help! Help!
- Help! Help!

685
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,351
She's dead.

686
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,790
<i>What happened?</i>

687
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,273
Yeah, you were right.

688
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,156
Looks like the same poison

689
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,680
that was used by that
serial killer

690
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,631
you guys were after.

691
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,352
They did this under
my own roof.

692
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,917
My <i>home.</i>

693
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,280
How-how could the killer
be here

694
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,836
the exact same time we were?

695
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,432
Must be something,
must...

696
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,071
It must be you.

697
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,674
What?
What do you mean?

698
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,075
He was here for you.

699
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,196
He must have figured out
that you were gonna

700
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,119
pass over information
about him.

701
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,670
I'm so sorry.

702
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,320
This is... this is all my fault.

703
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,840
I'm to blame.
I put you in danger.

704
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,713
No, no, no,
this is not your fault.

705
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,992
There's only one person
who's to blame for this.

706
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:43,992
Yeah.

707
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,917
I'm in no mood for
whatever it is.

708
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,837
You.

709
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,554
This is all your fault.

710
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,034
You ruined my life.
You drove me to do things

711
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:10,991
I never would've done.

712
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,759
And now...

713
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,798
there's a dead girl
down there because of you.

714
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,313
What is it with you humans?

715
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,156
Huh? Always blaming me.

716
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,199
I never make any of you
do anything.

717
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,436
That's not true.

718
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,757
You trick us

719
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:26,911
into sin,

720
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,270
damnation.

721
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,275
I have a story for you,
reporter.

722
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,951
One I've never told
a human soul before.

723
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,039
I take no part
in who goes to Hell.

724
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,670
Then who does?

725
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,270
You humans.

726
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,392
You send yourselves.

727
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,195
Driven down by your own guilt.

728
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,720
Forcing yourselves

729
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,236
to relive your sins
over and over.

730
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,193
And the best part...

731
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,993
the doors aren't locked.

732
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,879
You could leave anytime.

733
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,437
It says something

734
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,433
that no one ever does,
doesn't it?

735
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:05,871
No.

736
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,590
You're to blame.

737
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,269
I am responsible for
a lot of things, Reese,

738
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,955
but not your soul,
not your actions,

739
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,113
and not whoever killed
that poor girl downstairs.

740
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,636
Eh, you...

741
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,830
you have to be.

742
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,271
Otherwise...

743
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,073
Hurting me is not what you
really want to do, is it?

744
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,550
What are you doing to me?

745
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,999
Oh, you're a complicated one,
aren't you, Reese?

746
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,031
Strong.

747
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,557
Tell me...

748
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,837
what do you truly desire?

749
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,590
I...

750
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,717
I just want Linda to love me.

751
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,000
You're still in love
with your ex?

752
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,077
What about your wife?

753
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,430
She is my wife.

754
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,520
She'll always be my wife.

755
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,275
So... hold on,

756
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,711
that-that sleazy,
piece of garbage, that...

757
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,276
that was me?

758
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,559
It was me.

759
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,514
The way she looks at you.

760
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,551
Ah...

761
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,513
She cares for you.

762
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,630
How'd you do that?

763
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,192
How did you convince her
that the Devil, of all people...

764
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,357
was good?

765
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,749
I don't know.

766
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,151
I just...
showed her my true self.

767
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,272
But how could she
accept you after that?

768
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,511
Well, maybe she did...
because of that.

769
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,550
Hmm.

770
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,398
Before you say anything,
hear me out.

771
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,240
There's nothing
you can say.

772
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,317
I was a bad husband.

773
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,717
Put my work
above everything,

774
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,797
above us.

775
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,552
Our marriage failing

776
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,716
was all my fault.

777
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,071
And I'm sorry.

778
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,076
You deserved better.

779
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,036
Well, if we're...
if we're being honest...

780
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,592
it wasn't all
your fault.

781
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,960
I wasn't perfect either.

782
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,676
Truth is...

783
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,876
neither one of us could be
what the other one needed.

784
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,237
That's why it's good

785
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,238
that we're going
our separate ways.

786
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,318
But, Linda, no, no, I...

787
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,200
I thought me opening up
would bring us closer.

788
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,393
Like it did with
you and Lucifer.

789
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,231
Reese,

790
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,719
that's not how this works.

791
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,714
You forgave the Devil.

792
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,156
Why can't you forgive me?

793
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,720
You know, for a second,

794
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,438
I thought that you were honestly
taking responsibility.

795
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,640
But it's always the same
with you, over and over.

796
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,480
So determined, you never listen,
never learn.

797
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,909
Do you know
how much I love you?

798
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,713
The things that
I've done for you.

799
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,036
I went up against the Devil.

800
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,516
I risked everything getting
involved with a serial killer.

801
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,473
A poor girl got killed!

802
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,796
Wait, what?

803
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,197
I-I can explain...

804
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,231
Reese, what have you done?

805
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,556
No, it-it wasn't my fault.

806
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,910
- I'm calling the police.
- No.

807
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,116
It was an accident.

808
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,357
I-I didn't mean for
any of this to happen.

809
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,716
- Reese.
- Stop.

810
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,679
- Let me explain.
- Reese, let go of me.

811
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,637
- Reese.
- No, no!

812
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,593
- No!
- Reese, no!

813
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,033
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.

814
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,351
You're right.

815
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,756
Call Detective Decker.

816
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,919
Tell them they can
find me at my office.

817
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,830
I'll give them everything
that I have on Kapitski.

818
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,634
And I'll turn myself in.

819
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,351
I'm sorry.

820
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,030
You were right.

821
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,510
Let me make this right.

822
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,510
Good-bye, Reese.

823
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,072
You sent me
to kill the wrong man.

824
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,440
Lucifer wasn't a fraud.

825
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,831
He's an honest man.

826
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,996
As honest as they come.

827
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,954
No, no, the fraud is you!

828
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,432
Reporter lying to people.

829
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,110
A coward trying to get another
man to do his dirty work.

830
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,277
You're the one
who deserves to go next.

831
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,470
And now you will.

832
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,556
What are you laughing about?

833
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,271
I caught you.

834
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,717
Crap!

835
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,474
Let go! No!

836
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,470
Stay down.

837
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,675
Oh, Reesey.

838
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,754
You laying down on the job?

839
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,518
Don't tell me, asthma.

840
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,071
That...

841
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,319
or the poison I drank.

842
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,557
Well...

843
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,510
you didn't drink all of it.

844
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,514
I set things right.

845
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,872
Maybe this will
turn things around...

846
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,791
with Linda.

847
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,516
Welcome back to the land
of the living, Mr. Getty.

848
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,075
What...

849
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,836
what happened?

850
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,474
Just a little brush with death.

851
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,638
You had us worried there
for a while.

852
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,070
Is my wife here?

853
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,311
No.

854
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,352
I'm sorry, you haven't
had any visitors.

855
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,790
Well...

856
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,197
we have been having
some trouble lately.

857
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,830
But you know what?

858
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,954
Second chance on life.

859
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,712
Maybe it's not too late
to turn things around.
