1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,839
<i>- Previously on</i> Lucifer...
<i>- But I didn't</i>

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,997
<i>leave Hell to be a bartender.</i>

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,953
<i>You exist to protect me.</i>

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:07,952
<i>Whatever the danger,</i>

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,435
<i>I'll be there to stop it.</i>

6
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,915
<i>Now that we are stuck here,</i>

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,112
I need to figure out
where I fit in.

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,191
I got paid.

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,516
As a bounty hunter.

10
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,040
I need you to help me.

11
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,158
I'd have Maze do it,
but she's off bounty hunting.

12
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,680
Demons don't have a soul.

13
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,158
If I die, I just... die.

14
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,555
Ah.

15
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,479
How do you do
this every night?

16
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,591
How do you not?

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,393
Fear of liver failure, mostly.

18
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,837
We've been drinking
for three hours.

19
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,560
But I know
you've been going since...

20
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,750
Tuesday.

21
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,198
Why do you always
push yourself like this?

22
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,751
Because it's fun, Linda.

23
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,792
No rest for
the soulless.

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,718
Okay.

25
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,752
I've been meaning to
ask you about that.

26
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,270
You can't really mean
that you don't have a soul.

27
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,954
Ah, that she does.

28
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,640
No demons have souls.

29
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,556
That's why they're notorious
for living in the moment.

30
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,080
Yeah, when I die, that's it.

31
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,471
Maze out.

32
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,909
So don't waste a single second.

33
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,759
You humans could learn
a thing from her.

34
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,111
And me. Well, mostly me.

35
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,396
That's terrible.

36
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,239
I'm so sorry, Maze.

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,636
I have no complaints.

38
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,320
I just try and keep things
interesting.

39
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,274
I mean, I was getting
a little bored with the constant

40
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,470
drinking,

41
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,319
violence, sex.

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,717
You know how it is.

43
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,116
Yes, of course.

44
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,920
All those things,
all the time, for me.

45
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,634
Yeah, but now
I hunt humans, too.

46
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,196
Adds a little spice to things.

47
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,873
In fact, my next bounty
should be here any minute.

48
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,839
- You got your bounty to come to you?
- Mm-hmm.

49
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,316
- How'd you pull that off?
- Let me guess. Blackmail.

50
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,835
No. Promise of a threesome.

51
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,635
Drink coupon to Lux.

52
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,717
Coupon?

53
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,640
Maze, this isn't
some sort of student disco.

54
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,433
- No one in their right mind...
- I have a coupon

55
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,040
for a free margarita.

56
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,792
Oh.

57
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,596
Yeah.

58
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,794
Though I have to admit,
the job is losing its thrill.

59
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,676
I don't know.

60
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,032
I think I need... more.

61
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,911
Maybe you should take a breath

62
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,760
and appreciate
all that you have.

63
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,310
Slow down.

64
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,318
Like I wish
this spinning room would.

65
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,076
The room's not spinning, is it?

66
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,918
- No.
- No.

67
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,917
No. Okay.

68
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,476
Oh, this is cold.

69
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,273
This is cold and nice.

70
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,840
Don't listen to her.

71
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,156
You take it
from me, Maze.

72
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,393
The best thing to do is always
to follow your greatest desire.

73
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,593
Burn brighter, Mazikeen.

74
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,193
You should hunt the most
challenging human you can.

75
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,436
Sure the doctor will agree.

76
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,109
Once she wakes up.

77
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,479
Burn brighter it is.

78
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,955
Game on.

79
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,071
Cheers.

80
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,633
They were both screaming.

81
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,074
He didn't even seem to notice.

82
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,039
He killed them
like it was nothing.

83
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,594
There was so much blood.

84
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,797
I'll never forget...

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,229
Excuse me.

86
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,755
Is this your office?

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,956
Nope.

88
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,154
Uh, didn't think so.

89
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,634
Pretty sure it's mine.

90
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,038
This is the part

91
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,311
where you explain what the hell
you're doing at my desk.

92
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,989
You're, uh...

93
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,597
Lieutenant Herrera
of Organized Crime.

94
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,870
Yeah, I am.

95
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,198
Was it the "at my desk" part
that clued you in?

96
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,639
What are you doing
looking at old interviews

97
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,035
of the Ben Rivers case?

98
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,230
I want to find him.

99
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,880
What are you, an old
girlfriend or something?

100
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,833
I'm Mazikeen Smith.

101
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,951
Oh.

102
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,160
You're that bounty hunter
that works with Homicide.

103
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,476
Impressive record.

104
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,796
This says that Rivers
was in a small town in Canada

105
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,837
a couple weeks ago.

106
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,151
Yeah, he's been moving around
for the last couple months.

107
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,114
Always three steps ahead of
whoever's gone after him.

108
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,590
Not anymore.

109
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,276
Listen, if you're serious
about this,

110
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,115
you need to know that
Rivers is manipulative.

111
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,515
He's dangerous.

112
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,796
Oh, does he know kung fu?

113
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,798
Uh...

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,911
I don't think so.

115
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,634
Mm. Too bad.

116
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,234
You were getting me excited.

117
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,871
Don't.

118
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,472
Don't underestimate him.

119
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,070
All right?
He's killed two people

120
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,800
in broad daylight
because he felt like it.

121
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,951
Who knows what
else he's done?

122
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,874
Every bounty hunter who's
ever gone after him has failed.

123
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,835
Perfect.

124
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,716
Maze, really?

125
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,910
Do you even know what you're
getting yourself into?

126
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,918
Uh, h-have you even
been to Canada?

127
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,236
No. Come on.

128
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,760
Same humans,
different city.

129
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,917
Country.

130
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,919
Canada's a country, and it's
very different from here.

131
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,112
Okay, this, this is not

132
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,118
- cold-weather clothing.
- Yeah.

133
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,720
You know it's winter
there, right?

134
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,559
What's this? Is this
your cold-weather gear?

135
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,955
No, that's my whips and knives.

136
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,437
Uh...

137
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,877
Well, your whips and
knives are moving.

138
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,550
Trixie.

139
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,400
I can't let Maze
go alone.

140
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,552
Someone needs
to cover her back.

141
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,560
Thanks, little human.

142
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,037
No.

143
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,711
Listen,
I'm gonna be okay.

144
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,873
Besides, I need you

145
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,231
To stay here
and watch your mom.

146
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,717
That's true.

147
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,389
Without the two of us,
she's defenseless.

148
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,509
I don't know if I
like what you're whispering about.

149
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,835
Here. Take Miss Alien
with you, at least.

150
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,036
Knuckles.

151
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,874
Ugh. Come on.

152
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,116
Good luck, Maze.

153
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,199
Get some while I'm gone,
won't you, Decker?

154
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,474
Hey, Monkey.

155
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,075
Maze is gonna be
just fine.

156
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,839
Then why do you look
worried about her?

157
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,277
I'm not worried about Maze.
I'm worried about Canada.

158
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,360
Help!

159
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,631
Hey, give me my coat!

160
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,833
Hey! Come back here! Help!

161
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,716
Mm-hmm.

162
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,875
Yeah, that sounds like her.

163
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,276
Thanks.

164
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,550
Hey, hey, hey.

165
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,353
Someone's ready
for their vacation.

166
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,676
Ah, so ready.

167
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,360
This is my itinerary.

168
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,392
I will be available
by phone at all times.

169
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,114
If anything happens to Trixie,

170
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,310
I'll be on
the first flight back.

171
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,317
Daniel.

172
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,159
Where are you off to? The '80s?

173
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,550
Ha. Nice one. Hawaii.

174
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,874
I want you to enjoy Hawaii,
okay? You deserve it.

175
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,992
Thank you. Finally got
enough points together.

176
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,594
No crime scenes,
no paperwork.

177
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,757
I'm just gonna surf, I'm gonna
do a little bit of hiking,

178
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,632
and I'm gonna read a book.

179
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,035
- Good.
- Self-help, I assume.

180
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,435
Any man who chooses
three layovers

181
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,835
is clearly torturing himself.

182
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,952
I had to use travel points, man.
Not everyone has cash to burn.

183
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,594
Well, you should.
I mean, sometimes

184
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,314
I'll just light it on fire
and throw it up in the air

185
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,431
to see who...

186
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,189
That was a turn of phrase,
wasn't it?

187
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,037
Yeah.

188
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,237
Well, I'm gonna catch you guys
in a couple weeks.

189
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,800
- I'm out.
- Have fun!

190
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,789
Ooh, goody.

191
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,996
New dots.

192
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,920
So, where have you tracked Maze
tracking her bounty to now?

193
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,476
Yeah, okay.
A taxi theft in Vancouver.

194
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,115
A brawl with a curling team
in Montreal.

195
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,909
Oh, and the, uh, "bear attack"
that happened

196
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,311
in Prince Edward Island
I think was her, too.

197
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,954
Sounds like she's having
a splendid time.

198
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,116
I'm glad I suggested it.

199
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,993
So you're the reason
Canada's in danger?

200
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,475
Look, this is good
for Maze, Detective.

201
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,239
She needs a change of pace.

202
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,712
What Maze needs is our help
before she does any more damage.

203
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,956
This isn't about help.

204
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,958
This is about you being
an overprotective mother.

205
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,950
Look, trust me, Detective.

206
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,680
I've known Maze for eons.

207
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,280
She's got all of this
under control.

208
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,796
So...

209
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,909
Okeydokey, you betcha.

210
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,030
Beautiful morning, eh?

211
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,390
Welcome to
the best ski lodge

212
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,000
this side of
the Saskatchewan River.

213
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,954
No offense to the others,
of course.

214
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,276
Do you know this guy?

215
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,234
Not much of a chitchatter,
are you?

216
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,709
Do you know him?

217
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,955
Hmm.

218
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,992
"Hmm" you know him or not?

219
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,953
Gosh, I'm sorry.

220
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,435
I-I couldn't tell you
either way.

221
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,518
We pride ourselves
on our discretion.

222
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,480
And Flapjack Fridays.

223
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,034
Uh, would you like
a room, or...?

224
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,717
Do you know how to torture
someone... Norm?

225
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,956
Can't say that I do.

226
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,714
Well, I do.
I know how to find

227
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,072
a human's weakness
and use it against him.

228
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,315
For maximum pain.

229
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,920
Oh, I can't see
a nice lady like you

230
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,110
doing something like that.

231
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,680
What's your weakness, Norm?

232
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,990
- Money?
- Golly, no.

233
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,316
- Kink?
- That a band?

234
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,720
How about I break your fingers?

235
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,558
Oh, no.
If you did that,

236
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,439
I wouldn't be able to give
my wife her back rubs.

237
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,431
Though I suppose I could use
the old elbows in a pinch.

238
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,759
You love your wife,
don't you, Norm?

239
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,675
Oh, more than anything.

240
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,753
Yeah, I'm one lucky
son of a biscuit.

241
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,474
What-what are you doing?

242
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,273
You're a good husband.

243
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,317
Um...

244
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,271
A faithful...

245
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,317
Oh.

246
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,559
- ...husband.
- Uh...

247
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,153
How sweet.

248
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,954
I would hate

249
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,634
for anything...

250
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,631
to get in the way of that.

251
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,720
This... th-this is
not nice at all. No.

252
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,680
L-Lady, please don't.
Please don't take a photo.

253
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,950
Oh, no.

254
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,474
Now there's proof.

255
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,751
No, there's no proof.
Th-There's nothing happening.

256
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,792
Tell your wife that, hmm?

257
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,116
I'm sure she'll agree.

258
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,920
Hey, lady, can I
get a copy of that?

259
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,271
He-He's in Whistler with some
rich lady named Beauregard.

260
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,312
Now-now please get off my lap.

261
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,358
You are one terrible...
"B," lady.

262
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,433
You're not so bad
yourself, Norm.

263
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,560
That's the spot.

264
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,592
I am so glad the regular guy
took the day off.

265
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,520
You are finding
every single place I hurt.

266
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,956
It's what I do.

267
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,670
Roll over.

268
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,797
So...

269
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,033
tell me more about this guy
you're seeing.

270
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,078
- Oh.
- He sounds charming.

271
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,273
He is, but that's not all.

272
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,270
I really shouldn't
tell you this,

273
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,949
but he has a secret.

274
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,914
That he's a dangerous
killer on the run?

275
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,112
You are so funny.

276
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,596
No.

277
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,071
He is a prince.

278
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,473
He doesn't want
anyone to know.

279
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,234
He's so humble.

280
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,079
- Mm.
- Finally, I have found a guy

281
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,720
who doesn't just want me
for Daddy's money.

282
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,270
Sounds... too
good to be true.

283
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,036
I know.

284
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,031
Can't wait
to see him tonight.

285
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,077
Tonight?

286
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,590
So he's here?

287
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,995
He is.

288
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,710
And he's gonna take me
to his castle this weekend.

289
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,837
Ooh.

290
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,394
How amazing is that?

291
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,713
Oh, I can't wait.

292
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,396
Um, is it normal
for you to massage my boobs?

293
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,239
I can stop if you want.

294
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,436
Didn't say that.

295
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,110
Uh, Athena Burns?

296
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,231
I'm Detective Decker.

297
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,878
So you are
Ben Rivers' attorney?

298
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,437
I was, but I haven't
heard from him

299
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,558
in two years,
since he disappeared,

300
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,955
so I'm not quite sure
how much help I'll be.

301
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,072
Hmm, that's interesting,
'cause we know

302
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,317
that you've been communicating
with him over the phone.

303
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,556
I don't know what
you're talking about.

304
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,877
And if you have been
illegally wiretapping me,

305
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,190
this'll be a fun lawsuit.

306
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,436
Nope, no wiretapping.

307
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,835
We've just been tracking him
through a friend.

308
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,679
More stalking,
if you ask me.

309
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,597
I noticed that
wherever he's been,

310
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,360
there's a corresponding
phone call to your office.

311
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,794
Look, I want
to bring him in safely,

312
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,640
and as his attorney,
you should know

313
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,030
that that's
in his best interest.

314
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,154
This conversation is over.

315
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,317
Oh, good.

316
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,038
Good?

317
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,953
Yes. Well, the longer it takes,

318
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,992
the angrier
Maze is going to get.

319
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,519
Who or what is Maze?

320
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,071
Maze is the bounty hunter
that's about to catch Rivers.

321
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,391
Yes, and when she finally
catches up with the poor fellow,

322
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,235
she is going to tear him
limb from bloody limb.

323
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,511
- It'll be fantastic.
- She can't do that.

324
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,757
- Well...
- Oh, no, she definitely has the strength for it, doesn't she?

325
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,440
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I mean...

326
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,313
Actually, do you have to
bring a bounty back alive?

327
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,318
Would just the head suffice?
'Cause that is her thing.

328
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,749
- Mm.
- Maybe we could just

329
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,275
super glue him back
together on delivery.

330
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,675
You can't hurt him.

331
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,393
You seem to care
about him quite a bit.

332
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,840
Of course.
He is my client.

333
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,440
Mm-hmm.

334
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,358
But...

335
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,080
- Mm.
- Marvelous.

336
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,596
So, tell me, Ms. Burns,

337
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,917
why is his safety
so important to you, eh?

338
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,230
Hmm?

339
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,480
I... I don't...

340
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,552
Oh.

341
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,831
You're as formidable as your
power suit suggests, aren't you?

342
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,838
But don't worry,
you can tell me.

343
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,235
I know you want to.

344
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,271
I love him.

345
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,311
Oh.

346
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,674
I helped him
elude the police,

347
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,156
and I have been
sending him money ever since.

348
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,516
Have you now?

349
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,320
He's a cold-blooded murderer.

350
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,920
How could he get you
to do all this?

351
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,034
Obviously, you've never met him.

352
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,910
He's not what
you'd expect.

353
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,630
He's charming.

354
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,753
<i>And handsome and...</i>

355
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,433
<i>when he looks zou
in the eyes,</i>

356
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,071
I don't care who you are.

357
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,272
You are defenseless against him.

358
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,039
Oh. I'm sorry.

359
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,557
I thought you were
somebody else.

360
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,672
Yeah, that's kind of the point.

361
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,476
Whiskey, splash of water.

362
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,592
Right away.

363
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,797
And for the lady?

364
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,076
We don't have time for a drink.

365
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,839
Well, there's always
time for a drink.

366
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,957
Make mine a double.

367
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,071
My pleasure.

368
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,877
That's more like it.
I mean, you should celebrate.

369
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,560
After all, you did just catch

370
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,479
one of the greatest fugitives
in the world.

371
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,670
Did I?

372
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,751
'Cause I kind of expected
a little more killing

373
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,076
with my dangerous killer.

374
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,436
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you.

375
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,471
Oh, don't get me wrong.

376
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,239
Tracking you down wasn't easy,

377
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,070
but I thought you'd at least
put up a fight, or run.

378
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,477
Still holding out hope
you know some kung fu.

379
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,671
Hey...

380
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,920
I know when I've been beat.

381
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,076
You don't seem worried,

382
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,915
for a guy who just got caught
after two years on the run.

383
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,832
Oh, well, I knew
it would happen eventually.

384
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,800
Always wondered who'd get me.

385
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,831
I got to say,

386
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,915
I wasn't expecting someone so...

387
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,713
- Crazy hot?
- Familiar.

388
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,112
- We haven't met.
- No, I don't mean like that.

389
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,958
I mean, I recognize
that look in your eye.

390
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,031
You're a runner.

391
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,676
Just like me.

392
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,112
Is that your end game?
Try and get into my head?

393
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,350
Trust me, it
ain't gonna work.

394
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,960
- What's your name?
- Mazikeen Smith.

395
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,230
What's your real name?

396
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,717
Fake name. Which means
you're running from something.

397
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,036
Is that so?

398
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,192
Best way to pretend you're not
running away from something

399
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,715
is to run towards
something else.

400
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,876
Take it from
a guy who knows.

401
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,230
Is that what you do?

402
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,240
Run into the arms
of wealthy women?

403
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,073
It is not
a bad way to live.

404
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,270
You didn't hurt Muffy,
did you?

405
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,711
I assume that's
how you found me.

406
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,876
Ah, she's fine.

407
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,033
She means well,
poor thing.

408
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,437
And she's great
in the sack.

409
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,557
That she is.

410
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,551
Well...

411
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,030
It's been fun.

412
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,433
But now it's time
to bring you in.

413
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,480
Or fight.

414
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,631
Please... fight.

415
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,590
You're right.

416
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,151
Time to go.

417
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,950
Oh, wait.

418
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,516
There's a problem.

419
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,150
How are you gonna get
out of those cuffs?

420
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,640
I don't know who punched a hole
in the bathroom wall.

421
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,431
That's not why I'm calling,
but good to know.

422
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,830
What, you're checking up on me?

423
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,475
Uh, I was just calling to see
if you're okay, that's all.

424
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,115
Mm. I'm fine, okay?

425
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,510
In fact, I'm great.

426
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,916
This Rivers guy is a lot harder
to catch than I thought.

427
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,395
Ah, so you haven't
found him yet?

428
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,478
Oh, I found him.
And he got away.

429
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,877
And that's a good thing?
What if he comes after you now?

430
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,271
You think he would?

431
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,039
Maze...

432
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,191
Rivers is dangerous in ways

433
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,238
that I don't think
you're prepared for.

434
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,199
He's emotionally dangerous.

435
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,477
I don't even know
what that means.

436
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,160
I know, and that's the problem.

437
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,517
If...

438
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,557
<i>What the hell are you doing?</i>

439
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,757
Reminding you that you
are not Maze's mother.

440
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,191
She's got her big-girl
pants on. She's fine.

441
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,710
Really? Because she caught
Rivers, and he got away.

442
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,718
Oh, I doubt that.

443
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,832
Don't touch my nose.
It's true.

444
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,360
Lucifer, if he already
got in her head...

445
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,836
He hasn't. He probably just
came at her with a flamethrower

446
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,191
or something, which'll just
piss Maze off even more.

447
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,358
Now, did you tell her

448
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,914
we found out where
Rivers has been staying?

449
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,958
I didn't.
I don't know if I'm going to.

450
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,554
I'm worried about her.

451
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,036
Clearly, you're not.

452
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,674
No, I'm not.

453
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,360
I just sent her
the address.

454
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,880
- Lucifer...
- A flamethrower, Detective.

455
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,400
Or maybe even an Uzi.

456
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,557
Either way, it's nothing
Maze can't handle.

457
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,595
I'm sure.

458
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,754
Nice place.

459
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,717
Wish you had
some rock and roll, though.

460
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,630
Well, I'll
tell you what.

461
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,797
I'll run down to the store,
pick up a couple records,

462
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,190
- be right back.
- Stay.

463
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,993
There's always time
for a drink.

464
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,357
Wha...?

465
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,870
Come on.
Didn't we do this already?

466
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,356
It's not going to be
so easy this time.

467
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,950
That's a new one.

468
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,634
Look, I really don't
want to fight you.

469
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,594
Mm, I really do.

470
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,831
Okay.

471
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,030
Play time's over.

472
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,476
I don't think so.

473
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,638
I get it now. The
handcuffs, the music.

474
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,394
You wanted to
dance with me.

475
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,350
Or I wanted to cover
the sounds of screaming.

476
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,551
I know a little kung fu.

477
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,111
I'm beginning to think you
wanted me to escape that bar.

478
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,356
You like chasing me, don't you?

479
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,670
I like a challenge.

480
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,189
Shame it's not you.

481
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,040
I don't want to shoot you.

482
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,590
Yeah, well, you had no problem

483
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,757
killing those two people
in cold blood.

484
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,559
Look, I've done a lot
of terrible things in my life.

485
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,796
That's not one of them.

486
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,235
I was framed.

487
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,280
I don't care.

488
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,436
Yeah, well, you should.

489
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,679
'Cause Herrera's
gonna betray you next.

490
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,956
<i>Lieutenant Herrera?</i>

491
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,436
- And you must be Detective Decker.
- Uh, yes.

492
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,591
- Pleasure.
- Pleasure.

493
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,911
I know what this is about,
and I-I didn't mean

494
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,839
to stick my nose
in another cop's case.

495
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,554
Wait, wait.
You think I'm mad?

496
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,831
Are you kidding me?

497
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,235
You got me a new lead.

498
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,470
I'm here to thank you.

499
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,032
Oh.

500
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,071
Uh, you know,

501
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,157
but now that you
cracked it open...

502
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,119
- Mm-hmm?
- ...if you don't mind,

503
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,113
I want to carry this one
across the finish line.

504
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,555
Are you sure?
I'm happy to help.

505
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,637
Don't worry,

506
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,876
I'll give you all the credit.

507
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,471
It's just that
this one means a lot to me.

508
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,557
The one that got away, you know?

509
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,591
Right.

510
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,753
Yeah, of course. Absolutely.

511
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,117
Oh.

512
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,117
Yeah.

513
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,472
Yeah.

514
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,431
Thanks, Detective.

515
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,557
Yeah, I used to work
for Herrera, just like you.

516
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,077
He sent me to track
people down, or worse.

517
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,432
Then, one day, I quit.
He didn't like that.

518
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,956
That's a really nice story,
but like I said...

519
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,560
- You don't care.
- I don't.

520
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,877
Room service.

521
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,830
Never run on an empty stomach.

522
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,396
Say one word
and I'll break your arm.

523
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,674
Ah! Okay, all right.

524
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,031
Whatever you say.
We're just a happy couple.

525
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,033
Mr. and Mrs.
Mazikeen Smith.

526
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,070
I've seen you before.

527
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,157
Hi.

528
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,916
All right.

529
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,630
Come on, Maze, pick up.
Pick up.

530
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,519
Huh, not a good time, Decker.

531
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,671
Hey, it's me again.

532
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,599
I-I know you think
I'm just being a worrier,

533
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,315
but there is something strange
going on with this case,

534
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,954
so call me back ASAP.

535
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,197
Hey.

536
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,399
Look, I have a favor to ask you.

537
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,037
Hello?

538
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,720
Hello?

539
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,753
Everyone in here dead?

540
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,796
No? Didn't think so.

541
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,479
All right, we got to get
the hell out of here.

542
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,080
We can't just wait
for her to mow us down.

543
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,030
Oh, I'm not waiting.

544
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,758
Seriously? Knives
to a gunfight?

545
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,312
What the hell was that suppo...

546
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,392
Ow.

547
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,750
And you're welcome.

548
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,792
See?

549
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,190
I don't need a gun
to save your ass.

550
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,356
Come on.

551
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,029
Well, define
"saved," exactly.

552
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,199
<i>I've never seen
the detective quite like it.</i>

553
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,000
She's afraid that
Maze will get bamboozled

554
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,078
into helping
this handsome con man.

555
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,515
It's preposterous.

556
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,712
And you're
not concerned?

557
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,910
Oh, please.

558
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,152
Maze and I have been
through the plagues, the floods,

559
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,919
the Dave Matthews Band.

560
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,800
She can handle
a measly bounty, I'm sure.

561
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,077
What if it's not a
bounty she's after?

562
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,118
What if she's trying
to prove something?

563
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,993
What, that she can
scare an entire country?

564
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,355
Or that her life has meaning.

565
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,070
With or without a soul.

566
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,436
Every one of us

567
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,751
wants to connect
to something, Lucifer.

568
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,078
- Or someone.
- Oh, come on.

569
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,634
She's a demon.

570
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,150
Oh. Apologies. One sec.

571
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,874
Uh, I-I can't
talk right now, Maze.

572
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,677
I'm with a patient.

573
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,109
Yeah, well, so am I.

574
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,554
Is that a gunshot wound?

575
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,240
Oh, Mazikeen,
you little rascal.

576
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,079
Did you shoot the fellow?
Well done.

577
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,396
No, I didn't shoot him.

578
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,512
Some psycho from
room service did.

579
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,712
Well, so much for
Canadian hospitality.

580
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,033
Look, I don't have time
to explain, okay?

581
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,038
How do I stop this human
from dying?

582
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,517
Take him to a hospital,
that's how.

583
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,036
I mean, how many times
do I have to tell you

584
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,720
I'm not that
kind of doctor?

585
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,915
Whoa. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

586
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,110
First things first,

587
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,954
did the bullet go
all the way through?

588
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:29,831
I don't know.

589
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,429
Ow! What are you doing?!

590
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,074
Get... Stop it!

591
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,515
Get... Will you s...

592
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,631
Oh, no, it's
still in there.

593
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,037
- Good.
- Okay, all right.

594
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,600
Well, in order to
stop the bleeding,

595
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,871
you're going to have
to remove the bullet

596
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,992
- and stitch up the wound.
- Oh.

597
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,674
Oh, yeah, you know what,
I'm good.

598
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,554
Relax, okay?

599
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,830
I'm great at
dismembering humans.

600
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,434
How hard can it be
to fix one?

601
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,120
Maybe you should
listen to him, Maze.

602
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,232
I mean, it's everyone's right
to refuse treatment.

603
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,477
He is my bounty and I am
taking him in one piece.

604
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,909
Just tell me what to do,
Doc.

605
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,236
Uh, okay.

606
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,557
Uh, find the hotel sewing kit.

607
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,758
You can stitch him up
with that, and you'll need

608
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,440
alcohol for the wound.

609
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,237
What?

610
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,436
Well, you're not
<i>that</i> handsome.

611
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,916
That's helpful. Thank you.

612
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,832
You're welcome.

613
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,996
Got everything.

614
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,231
What...

615
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,598
Next.

616
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,234
Well, you'll have to...

617
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,678
fish out the bullet.

618
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,076
Oh, you know what, I've grown
kind of attached to it.

619
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,839
I think I'm gonna keep it.
Thank you, though.

620
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,957
And if you have
any sedatives,

621
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,514
I highly recommend
he takes them.

622
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,111
You got any drugs?

623
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,515
- What?
- Too bad.

624
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,831
Sorry.

625
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,795
You know, I-I got this.
I'll let you know if he dies.

626
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,238
Is it me, or did
the most skilled torturer

627
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,909
Hell's ever known
just fluff that man's pillow?

628
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,156
It's not you.

629
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,430
Right.

630
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,591
Then it's true.

631
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,912
He broke my Maze.

632
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,674
Well, this is different.

633
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,040
That's Miss Alien.

634
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,270
Nothing weird happened,
if that's what you're wondering.

635
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,390
I-I wasn't.

636
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,670
But thank you.

637
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,996
Oh.

638
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,396
Oh, my head hurts.

639
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,273
Yeah, pre-surgical knockout.

640
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,795
Least I got
the bullet out, though.

641
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,070
Oh.

642
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,430
Is that a button?

643
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:52,752
Sure.

644
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,594
Come on. Get ready.

645
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,154
We're leaving in five.

646
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,953
You take me back,
I'm a dead man.

647
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,389
Not my problem.

648
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,149
You still think I'm guilty.

649
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,830
Even after
they tried to kill me.

650
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,157
Fugitives get shot at.
Occupational hazard.

651
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,717
I'm telling you, Herrera
paid the security guard to lie.

652
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,077
It doesn't matter.

653
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,350
Yeah, it does.

654
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,035
I didn't kill those kids.

655
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,718
They were teenagers.
That's why I refused.

656
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,840
Why? No challenge?

657
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,791
No.

658
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,632
'Cause when you kill,
you lose a piece of your soul.

659
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,238
I'm trying to hold on
to what I got left of mine.

660
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,389
I get the feeling
you understand that.

661
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,478
Sorry. No soul here.

662
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,511
Really?

663
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,990
That's not what I see.

664
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,717
Let me guess.

665
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,470
More room service?

666
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,480
Whoa! Whoa!

667
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,040
Seriously!

668
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,150
You don't look before you throw?

669
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,158
What are you doing here, Dan?

670
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,116
I don't know, Maze, you tell me.

671
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,156
I should be drinking
a mai tai right now,

672
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,033
but instead, I'm getting worried
phone calls from Chloe

673
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,316
asking me to check up on you.

674
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,630
And you did it?

675
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,595
I was on a layover
in Vancouver, okay?

676
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,396
It was a miles flight.

677
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,590
I just...

678
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,157
I shouldn't have come here.

679
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,192
What is Decker
so worried about anyway?

680
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,080
Something about
this Rivers case.

681
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,913
She thinks that something weird
might be going on with...

682
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,713
- With the lieutenant?
- Yeah.

683
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,715
Uh-huh. How'd you know?

684
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,032
'Cause my bounty
just said the same thing.

685
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,516
River...

686
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,837
<i>Okay.</i>

687
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,871
Thanks.

688
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,557
I filled Chloe in
on Rivers' story.

689
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,679
Lying security guard?

690
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,510
I don't know, Maze.

691
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,950
Sounds like a long shot.

692
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,516
You think I got played.

693
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,117
I think...

694
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,236
Rivers is a con man.

695
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,159
I'm not an idiot, Dan.

696
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,874
- I know.
- You said it yourself:

697
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,396
there's something weird going on
with this Herrera guy.

698
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,270
If Rivers is so innocent,
why the hell did he run?

699
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,314
'Cause who would
believe him?

700
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,596
Even I didn't.

701
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,430
Either way, psycho room service
chick is out there.

702
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,637
We need to get to him
before she does.

703
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,591
How?

704
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,639
What, with my knives
and your gun?

705
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:18,957
Piece a cake.

706
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,511
One small problem.

707
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,154
I don't actually
have my gun.

708
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,914
You're a cop
and you don't have your gun?

709
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,440
I'm supposed to
be on vacation.

710
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,790
A boring one, apparently.

711
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,831
You want to
help this guy?

712
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,072
The best thing to do

713
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,879
is to turn this case
over to the Canadians.

714
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,236
Let the Mounties
handle it.

715
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,557
Why? So they can
nice the bad guys to death?

716
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,195
We don't have
any jurisdiction here, Maze.

717
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,471
This whole thing can get
real messy real fast.

718
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,392
Fine. Have it your way.

719
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,672
Really?

720
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,031
Yeah.

721
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,355
Well, I'm just, uh, I'm
surprised you actually agreed.

722
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,596
It...

723
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,720
shows growth.

724
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,356
It's healthy.

725
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,717
Nice.

726
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,073
Uh, yeah, this is
Detective Espinoza

727
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,760
from the Los Angeles
Police Department.

728
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,834
I need to report a fugitive.

729
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,470
Yeah. Uh, yeah, one second.

730
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,909
Hey, what was Rivers...

731
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,630
...wearing?

732
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,876
All right.

733
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,274
Ah! There you are.

734
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,076
Okay, you were right.

735
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,795
It seems this Rivers fellow
may have indeed hoodwinked Maze.

736
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,397
Or maybe I was wrong.

737
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,149
Okay, who are you and what have
you done with the detective?

738
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,278
Turns out Maze
spoke to Rivers.

739
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,758
He claims the security
guard was lying,

740
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,679
that he was forced to
pin the murder on him.

741
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,030
That's why Rivers is on the run.

742
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,152
And you believe
that preposterous story?

743
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,039
An innocent man
wrongly accused?

744
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,310
I mean, where did
he escape from, Shawshank?

745
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,914
- Did he crawl through a mile of sh...
- Hey!

746
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,033
It's not like Maze
to reach out with a lead.

747
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,435
I know. This is much worse
than I thought.

748
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,916
I mean, first she fluffs
the man's pillow,

749
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,759
and now she's trying
to clear his name.

750
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,599
Do you know, I never thought
I'd say this, Detective,

751
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,029
but we need to go to Canada.

752
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,192
- Now.
- Wait. Hold on! Hold on.

753
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,629
I can tell
you're worried...

754
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,479
and that's actually
really endearing...

755
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,392
but Dan's there.

756
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,080
- That's worse.
- Right now,

757
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,509
Maze needs
a different kind of help.

758
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,074
What, some strong drugs
and a lobotomy?

759
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,317
She needs us to trust her.

760
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,033
You're actually serious,
aren't you?

761
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,238
You're the one who said
Maze can handle herself,

762
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,436
and I think you're right.

763
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,836
She trusts us enough
to ask for help.

764
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,673
We owe it to her
to follow her lead.

765
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,718
Oh, boy.

766
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,912
Unless this is about you
being the overprotective mother.

767
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,199
Oh. Low blow, Detective.

768
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,277
Well...

769
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,034
Fine. Let's speak
to the security guard,

770
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,196
if only to prove
that this Rivers

771
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,909
is indeed a con man so I can
freely punch him in his smug,

772
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,839
mildly handsome face.

773
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,717
Thanks for coming in, Pete.

774
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,952
We just have some questions
about the Rivers case

775
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,271
and to clarify some things
about your testimony.

776
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,559
I.e., tell us
what we all already know.

777
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,836
Guilty.

778
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,757
Anything I can do.

779
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,394
Thanks. Is it true

780
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,156
that you saw Rivers shoot those
two kids at point-blank range?

781
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,360
- Sadly, yes.
- See?

782
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,630
What did I tell you? Guilty.

783
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,036
Now can I go to Canada?

784
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,316
Not yet.

785
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,112
Uh...

786
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,556
How many times
did you see him fire, exactly?

787
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,753
Oh. Uh, it was a few years ago.

788
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,916
Hard to remember now.

789
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,310
Oh, come now, Peter.

790
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,239
Think about it. I mean,
a rotten apple like Rivers

791
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,755
would shoot every bullet he had,
wouldn't he?

792
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,514
Lucifer.
How many's in a clip? 12?

793
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,598
- 15? 20?
- Please...

794
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,510
Yeah. That sounds about right.

795
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,154
He's a vile predator,

796
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,874
- that one, isn't he?
- The worst.

797
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,958
Bet he shot those poor kids
right in the back, didn't he?

798
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,636
He totally did.

799
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,638
Really?

800
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,069
'Cause in your testimony,

801
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,069
you said it was
the other way around.

802
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,320
Oh. Uh...

803
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,835
You know, I...

804
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,671
By... I assume by "back,"
you meant, like...

805
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,752
the opposite.

806
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,837
Oh, so you're just telling us

807
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,633
what you think
we want to hear, huh?

808
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,836
I thought
that's what you wanted.

809
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,917
- Aren't you working with...
- Herrera?

810
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,397
Not exactly.

811
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,278
Wait.

812
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,630
What just happened?

813
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,596
Maze is right.
Rivers is innocent.

814
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,272
Which means she's in
more trouble than she knows.

815
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,554
Hey! Room Service!

816
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,797
That's my bounty, bitch.

817
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,278
Well, well, if it isn't
our clever little friend

818
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,800
with the knives.

819
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,236
- So nice of you to join us.
- Back off.

820
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,471
He's mine.

821
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,795
Okay, first off,

822
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,231
ladies, I don't
belong to anyone.

823
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,676
And, secondly,

824
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,236
I got these guys
exactly where I want them.

825
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,234
This gun to my head?

826
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,871
I like it there.

827
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,755
And these big
scowly dudes,

828
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,951
harmless.

829
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,159
So you should go
before you get in the way.

830
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,949
What part of "you're my bounty"

831
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,720
do you not get?

832
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,396
I'm not going anywhere.

833
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,591
Actually,

834
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,200
that part's true.

835
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:33,038
See, you saved us a trip.

836
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,358
After all, we weren't about
to let you live after you threw

837
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,710
a damn knife at me.

838
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,519
Oh, well,
thanks for bringing backup.

839
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,189
More fun for me.

840
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,435
Oh, and he's cute, too.

841
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,237
Bonus.

842
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,790
Kill her first.

843
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:04,997
Oh, crap.

844
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,231
Well, well, well.

845
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,356
Look who saved who.

846
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,596
I told you I had 'em.

847
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,794
You opened your stitch,
didn't you?

848
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,237
I hope I didn't lose the button.

849
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,077
I'll handle this.

850
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,191
Go.

851
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,156
Come on.

852
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,393
Okay, seriously,
this is getting old.

853
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,400
Why are you in my office now?

854
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,157
Uh, correction,
it <i>was</i> your office.

855
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,672
Turns out murderers
aren't allowed to masquerade

856
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,996
as lieutenants anymore.

857
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,390
What are you
talking about?

858
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,838
He's talking about how you had

859
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,077
those kids killed,
how you framed Rivers,

860
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,475
and you almost killed our friend

861
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,114
who was trying
to clean up your mess.

862
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,312
Okay, wait a
minute, all right? Wait.

863
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,192
This is absurd.

864
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,869
You can't possibly believe
a-a con man's story.

865
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,509
We don't have to.

866
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,155
We have testimony from the guard
you forced to lie.

867
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,999
Uh, and the hit man
you hired

868
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,680
is currently
in Canadian custody.

869
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,077
But don't worry,
they gave you all the credit.

870
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,669
You're under arrest.

871
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,870
Oh, come on. Really?

872
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,275
Yes. Really.

873
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,710
And if it's
any consolation,

874
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,877
I suggested we beat you to death
with our bare hands,

875
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,958
but the detective insisted
we do it by the book.

876
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,073
And considering I know where
you're eventually going to go,

877
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,760
that's fine by me.

878
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,190
Thanks, Decker.

879
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,193
Well, looks like all
your whining finally paid off.

880
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,680
Herrera just got arrested for
the murder of those two kids.

881
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,200
So...

882
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,197
So...

883
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,994
so I'm not a fugitive anymore.

884
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,600
Yeah, which kind of screws me,

885
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,598
'cause you're also
not my bounty anymore either.

886
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,756
Mm.

887
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,920
No good deed.

888
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,910
Did you hear
what I just said?

889
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,674
You don't have to run anymore.

890
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,999
You can... come home.

891
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,154
Yeah, you don't get it.

892
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,680
This doesn't end with Herrera.

893
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,760
He's just a cog
in the machine.

894
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,719
The people he works for,
they'll never stop chasing me.

895
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,710
Okay.

896
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,957
Dramatic much?

897
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,198
If you worked for Herrera,
they know about you, too.

898
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,557
Everything about you.

899
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,240
I sincerely doubt that.

900
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,956
Yeah, well,
you don't know them like I do.

901
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,194
I can never stop running, Maze.

902
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,596
But what if...

903
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,390
what if you came with me?

904
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,193
We can do this, Maze.

905
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,189
You and me,
we're the same.

906
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,631
No roots. No family.

907
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,795
We can...
hit a new city every week,

908
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,349
<i>see the most beautiful places,</i>

909
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,472
<i>live every day
like it's our last.</i>

910
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,879
<i>And all you got to do is...</i>

911
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,996
join me.

912
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,951
Welcome back, Maze.

913
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,195
Welcome home, lady.

914
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,276
Missed you, Maze.

915
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,394
Didn't doubt you for a minute.

916
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,350
Forgetting something?

917
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,117
Oh.

918
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,634
I, uh, can get you a new one.

919
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,434
She kind of got a little...

920
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,031
dirty.

921
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,117
Is that... blood?

922
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,757
Oh, yeah.

923
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,076
Awesome!

924
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,589
No, why don't we put
Miss Alien in the wash.

925
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,553
You won't
change her, right?

926
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,595
Maze.

927
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,472
Hmm?

928
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,757
You all right?

929
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,111
I'm exactly where I want to be.

930
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,350
You're not coming, are you?

931
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,720
You may not have roots, but...

932
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,834
turns out I do.

933
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,833
And I may even...

934
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:28,712
...miss them.

935
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,714
And here you thought
you didn't have a soul.

936
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,319
Remember what I said, Maze.

937
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,597
Be careful.

938
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,276
They know more than you think.
