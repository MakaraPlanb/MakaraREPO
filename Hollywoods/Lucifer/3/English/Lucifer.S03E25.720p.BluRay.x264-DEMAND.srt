1
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,911
Hey.

2
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,431
How's it going, Frank?

3
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,313
You still kicking
that hernia's butt?

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,510
Nice.

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,071
Morning, Jane.

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,237
Talk about a buzzer-beater
last night, am I right?

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,191
Bam!

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,437
Hey, guys.

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,551
Morning.

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,434
- Oh, I like your hair today.
- Thank you.

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,800
Tough break, Beth.

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,637
But we're gonna figure out
what happened to you.

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,310
Hey, little brother.

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,276
You did what?

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,676
They said that?

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,635
Well, that's never gonna happen.

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,830
Seriously?

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,040
Fine, okay.

19
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,870
Dude.

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,236
What are you doing?

21
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,113
Well, this macro lens
gets so much more detail

22
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,436
- than my phone camera does.
- Gross.

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,518
Oh, someone's
a crabby-pants today.

24
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,836
How's it going, Ella?

25
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,951
Couldn't be better.

26
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,477
Really?

27
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,712
Sorry, my brother just called.

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,752
Ah, right.
Well, family are the worst.

29
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,793
- Crab away.
- Well, apparently,

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,038
uh, my brother moved back
to Detroit a week ago.

31
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,039
And did he bother to
give me a heads-up?

32
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,151
Uh, no, <i>se√±or.</i>

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,595
Not to mention
that he's the reason

34
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,359
I moved out to L.A.
in the first place.

35
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,473
And now my whole family wants me
to move back home, too.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,719
Are you considering
moving back home?

37
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,719
Well, I mean, you guys know
how much I love it here, but...

38
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,356
they're my family.

39
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,392
So, you know, yeah.

40
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,831
Well, Ella, you know, I'm... I'm
trying to be supportive, but...

41
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,032
Well, I'm not.
Don't you dare go.

42
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,031
I may not have a choice.

43
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,674
Everyone has a choice, Ms. Lo...

44
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,600
Anyhoo, um,
so much going on here.

45
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,950
- Let me show you.
- Mm-hmm.

46
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,119
This right here is Dr. Beth
Daly, child psychiatrist.

47
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,470
Looks like blunt force trauma.

48
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,636
Someone hit her over the head?

49
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,436
Yes, and yes, but there's
so much more to it than that.

50
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,880
From what I can tell,
the killer was standing here

51
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,680
when they grabbed
their murder weapon.

52
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,633
You see this spot in the dust,
right here?

53
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,991
Fallen books,
and only one bookend.

54
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,390
So she was killed with
the missing bookend?

55
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,354
Mm, yes and no.
So the bookend...

56
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,279
made her woozy, right?

57
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,269
And then, she stumbled,
slipped on this toy train,

58
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,678
grabbed this chair, fell back,

59
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,357
hit her head on this table and
bang, that's what killed her.

60
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,119
Oh, bravo, Ms. Lopez.
See, that's another reason

61
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,390
why you shouldn't leave.

62
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,040
Crime scenes would be
so dull without you.

63
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,118
Thank you.
But wait, there's more.

64
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,232
- There always is.
- I found

65
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,234
a weird clump of hair
under Beth's nails.

66
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,275
- It's all gunky, too.
- Is that blood?

67
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,194
Mm, I can't really tell yet,
there's not enough of it.

68
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,794
I got to get it
back to the lab.

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,276
Hmm. Oh.

70
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,432
Well, looks like there's a smear
here, like somebody tried

71
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,279
to wipe away some blood.

72
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,871
Good eye.

73
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,474
I'm thinking maybe the
girl who called it in?

74
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,751
Yeah.
Beckett Wilson.

75
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,434
She was the doctor's
next patient.

76
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,911
She found the body,
she was pretty shaken up.

77
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,715
Talk about shock therapy.

78
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,078
Well, I mean, wiping
blood off the wound

79
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,476
is consistent with someone
who cares about the victim.

80
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,189
Well, Dan took Beckett to
the precinct to calm her down,

81
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,117
so I'll go check in with them.

82
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,595
Okay, and I'll check
in with the lab,

83
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,029
- see if they can rush this hair.
- Great.

84
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,390
All right.

85
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,438
I will check in
with the nearest pharmacy.

86
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,273
No, she still
isn't talking.

87
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,393
Poor kid's pretty traumatized.

88
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,592
No, I don't see any blood
on her hands or her clothes.

89
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,356
I'll ask her.

90
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,676
Bye.

91
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,676
Hey, Beckett?

92
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,831
When you found the body,

93
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,152
did you maybe try to
wipe up any blood?

94
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,919
I don't think I did.

95
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,158
But it's all so fuzzy.

96
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,677
Hey, it's okay.

97
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,876
We'll just talk later.

98
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,879
Is there anything
I can do now?

99
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,958
A Slurpee would be nice.

100
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,960
A Slurpee it is.

101
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,279
- See you, Frank.
- You, too.

102
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,040
What's this?

103
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,836
<i>You don't possibly
think my son could've done this.</i>

104
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,589
No, Mr. Rodriguez,
Felix is not a suspect.

105
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,632
He doesn't fit the
forensic's profile.

106
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,197
However, we did look
at Beth's appointment book,

107
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,830
and he was scheduled
for much earlier this morning.

108
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,759
So do you have any idea
why he was still here?

109
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,394
Of course I do.

110
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,239
He brought his violin
to his appointment this morning,

111
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,556
and he left it there.

112
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,274
The office isn't far
from our house,

113
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,472
so I let him ride his bike
back to get it.

114
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,959
Well, we think Felix got here
shortly after Beth was killed.

115
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,231
So we'd like to speak to him,
see if he saw anything.

116
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,719
Well, that might be tough.

117
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,591
Uh, Felix is... shy.

118
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,039
He struggles
with communication,

119
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,515
social skills.

120
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,639
That's why he was
seeing Dr. Beth.

121
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,432
Mm.

122
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,080
I don't know
what we're gonna do without her.

123
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,237
I mean, she's helped
Felix so much.

124
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,274
He's thriving
in school,

125
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,152
he's got all kinds of new
friends and-and interests.

126
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,112
He's like a totally
different kid.

127
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,513
He's just still not
very open with strangers.

128
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,272
I see.

129
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,230
Hey, buddy.

130
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,599
Can I help you get that off?

131
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,912
You know, when I
was about your age,

132
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,274
I was in a car accident.

133
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,475
It was pretty bad.

134
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,238
I saw lots and
lots of blood.

135
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,951
I know how scary
it can be.

136
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,113
But you're gonna be okay.

137
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,150
I promise.

138
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,473
I didn't see who did it.

139
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,309
Okay. Thanks for telling me.

140
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,670
Oh, my gosh, <i>mijito,</i>
are you okay?

141
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,349
- What happened?
- Hey, let's just get Felix home right now.

142
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,677
I'll explain everything
when we've all calmed down.

143
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,511
Here's my card.

144
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,196
If Felix thinks of anything
else, or mentions anything,

145
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,834
please, feel free to call me.

146
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,030
- All right.
- Thank you.

147
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,711
Well, aren't you
a little strange one?

148
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,912
I know you are, but what am I?

149
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,116
Ray-Ray?

150
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,720
What are you doing here?

151
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,480
Now, is that any way to greet
one of your oldest friends?

152
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,354
Okay, hi.

153
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,153
We kind of sort of
agreed to never

154
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,794
- see each other again.
- Did we?

155
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,997
I don't remember putting
such a fine point on it.

156
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,156
We did, we did. Super fine.

157
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,396
Five years ago, in Detroit?

158
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,397
I know you remember.

159
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,150
Look, I'm sorry.

160
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,559
I just... I miss you.

161
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,514
Okay, it's not that I don't
miss you, too, okay?

162
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,672
I just thought that
this part of my life was over.

163
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,315
The part with you in it.

164
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,239
It's just...
it's a little too weird.

165
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,750
Okay? So please,
just go away. Just...

166
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,316
Hey, sorry, uh,
should I come back another time?

167
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,631
No.

168
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,871
Good.

169
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,440
I'm all good.

170
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,437
Are you sure?

171
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,077
Yeah. Yeah, I'm-I'm fantastic,
actually, just, you know,

172
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,199
talking to myself.

173
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,831
Mm-hmm.

174
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,438
- You sure you're fine?
- Fantastic, actually,

175
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,075
you know,
just talking to myself.

176
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,119
Uh, uh, to this evidence.

177
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,312
Wish it would just
go away.

178
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,874
Wish it would go away, why?

179
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,912
Because it just showed
up out of nowhere.

180
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,952
Just... poof.

181
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,117
- What?
- Yeah, so, you remember that,

182
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,030
um, weird clump of hair
that I found on the vic?

183
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,637
Well, it turns out

184
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,719
that it's a synthetic fur,
used to make anything

185
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,310
from carpets to,
uh, plush toys.

186
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,473
Okay, but it was found
under Beth's nails, right?

187
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,511
Which still implies a struggle.

188
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,597
And there was blood on it?

189
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,634
Nope. Turns out
that it was ketchup.

190
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,752
Even though there wasn't a
scrap of food in the joint.

191
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,754
So, uh, like I said, it
just came out of nowhere.

192
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,912
Do you see why
it's so annoying?

193
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,270
Okay, I'm gonna go
search Beth's house.

194
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,960
Maybe I'll find a match
to the fur there.

195
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,435
Great. Uh,
I'll join you.

196
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,800
You're trying to
avoid me, aren't you?

197
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,037
Nope. No, I am not.

198
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,471
- La, la, la, la...
- Come on, Ellz, let's just hang for a little bit.

199
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,878
No. You're a ghost.

200
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,917
Not to be biased,

201
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,430
but ghosts
are pretty frickin' cool,

202
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,994
and you being able to see them

203
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,317
makes you extra
frickin' special.

204
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,877
Okay, first of all,
I see <i>a</i> ghost... <i>a</i> ghost... you.

205
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,515
And yes, as a kid,
I did feel special, okay?

206
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,632
But special or not,
it's not normal.

207
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,240
And since when
do you care about that?

208
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,999
Normal is boring.

209
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,316
Since Detroit.

210
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,000
We agreed, both of us,

211
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,510
that this wasn't good
for me anymore, okay?

212
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,511
I really like who I am in L.A.

213
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,559
I'm just this super happy
open book.

214
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,880
It feels really, really good
to have no secrets.

215
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,032
Okay, then,
tell everyone about me.

216
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,755
Don't hide your Ray-Ray of light
under a bushel, baby.

217
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,633
Yeah, I tried that, remember?

218
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,155
Remember Laurie Dupont's
slumber party,

219
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,516
when they wrote "weirdo" on me

220
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,756
in shaving cream?

221
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,713
Remember that time that
that shrink thought

222
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,719
that I was legitimately crazy
and put me on all those meds?

223
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,192
We can't be friends, okay?

224
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,710
It's just... it's too hard.

225
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,079
Anyway, I have to
get back to work.

226
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,830
Wait. I... okay, uh, I
didn't want to say this,

227
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,311
but the reason why I'm here

228
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,558
is to help you with,
you know, work stuff.

229
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,560
Why would a ghost want
to help me with work stuff?

230
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,912
Ooh.

231
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,277
Do you know the victim?

232
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,712
Like-like, from the ghost world?

233
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,229
Yeah, I do.

234
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,710
Okay, so why didn't you
lead with that?

235
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,276
Uh, ghost rules.

236
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,476
Um, can't share stuff

237
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,512
that you don't already know
from the living world.

238
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,918
Ghost rules? You've never
mentioned "ghost rules" before.

239
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,554
Well, you know,
I-I never had to.

240
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,717
Okay, fine, so when this case
is over, you will go away again?

241
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,879
Fine, you can come with, okay?
But just lay low.

242
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,632
Cool, man, you won't
even notice I'm here.

243
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,397
Okay.

244
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,080
I looked away
for one second, man.

245
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,680
How could I possibly
know what she was planning?

246
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,514
Uh, let me get this straight,

247
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,552
you were tasked with escorting
the young lady to the precinct

248
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,837
and she ran away
with your phone.

249
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,236
- Yes, with my phone.
- Ooh!

250
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,510
Clearly, Beckett manipulated me,

251
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,910
which means she wasn't
really upset

252
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,552
and could actually know more

253
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,796
about this murder
than we thought.

254
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,673
Daniel, this is
monumentally asinine,

255
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,631
even for you.

256
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,752
Oh, thanks, man.
I appreciate that.

257
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,159
And yes, I know, it's bad,
it's really bad.

258
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,040
I got to find
that girl, Lucifer.

259
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,590
And I-I wouldn't be here
if I wasn't desperate, so...

260
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,960
you gonna help me or not?

261
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,594
Of course, Daniel.

262
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,679
- You gonna make fun of me all day?
- Of course, Daniel.

263
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,431
Great.

264
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,230
Dang.

265
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,514
Crown molding, open floor plans.
I mean...

266
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,717
L.A. architecture is amazing.

267
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,116
Shh!

268
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,111
I didn't say anything.

269
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,473
Oh, um, no, no, no,
I-I stubbed my toe. Shh-ouch.

270
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,195
Okay. I'll-I'll take upstairs,
you take down here.

271
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,794
- Okay.
- All right.

272
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,792
Okay, ground rules.

273
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,157
No speaking
unless spoken to.

274
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,720
And in general,
just don't be creepy.

275
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,354
So no more watching you shower?

276
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,431
Okay, geez, I was kidding.

277
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,756
Holy crap. Look.

278
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,074
Dude, weren't you into that?

279
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,272
I was into
cosplay, actually.

280
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,120
Right. Hard to keep track
of all your hobbies.

281
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,756
Uh, yeah, I had all those
hobbies to distract myself

282
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,156
from the voice in my head,
aka you.

283
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,873
Can you please just
give me some space?

284
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,595
- Geez, no Ella love today.
- Oh, no.

285
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,032
I-I was just...
Look what I found.

286
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,351
Uh...

287
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,113
What is that?
Like, a mascot?

288
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,879
No, it's a furry suit.

289
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,797
I know, furries get a bad rap,
but they're almost never sexual.

290
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,997
I mean, most of the time,
totally wholesome.

291
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,995
If that's what
you were thinking.

292
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,872
- I'm thinking that's a big stain.
- A hundred bucks it's ketchup.

293
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,639
Which means Beth
was wearing this

294
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,672
probably shortly
before she died.

295
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,475
Also means that that fur clue
doesn't lead to a suspect.

296
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,758
I found something that might.
Listen to this.

297
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,679
That's it, Beth.

298
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,351
I'm gonna be the only one with
Wesley tomorrow night at SCC.

299
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,035
He's mine. This ends now.

300
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,475
Geez, threaten much?

301
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,080
Yeah, Beth and this woman
were fighting

302
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,310
over some guy named Wesley.

303
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,195
That's a solid motive,
but I checked the number,

304
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,356
it's blocked.

305
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,315
No worries. She said SCC.

306
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,518
I know exactly
where to find her.

307
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,592
I don't think this
is gonna work, guys.

308
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,393
Just ask someone
if they know Wesley.

309
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,232
Pardon me.

310
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,200
Do you know anyone named Wesley?

311
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,231
Yeah, definitely not sure
this is gonna work.

312
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,152
Hey.

313
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,350
Could you ask Beth

314
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,519
to describe this Wesley dude
that she was trying to steal?

315
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,997
Um, I think that actually falls
under ghost rule no-nos.

316
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,951
Ray-Ray, come on.
This is important.

317
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,992
And you said that you wanted
to help your friend.

318
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,954
Yeah, okay.

319
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,437
Let me see if I can, uh,
communicate with her.

320
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,916
Yeah. Dang. Ugh.
I can't seem to get through.

321
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,792
What do you mean?

322
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,960
Uh, there must be some kind of,

323
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,192
like, a cell phone tower
or something.

324
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,277
Seriously?

325
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,999
You don't know Beth
at all, do you?

326
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,440
How could you lie to me,
Ray-Ray?

327
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,189
Okay, the reason
why I'm here is...

328
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,389
- personal.
- Personal how?

329
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,717
Let's just say I have
some unfinished business.

330
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,150
Wait a second.

331
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,600
Does Beth's death
have something to do

332
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,916
with why you're
still roaming the earth?

333
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,315
Yes, actually.

334
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,511
If solving this case
will somehow help you finally

335
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,433
cross over to
the other side,

336
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,040
then let's do this.

337
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,196
You'll be at peace,

338
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,430
and so will I.

339
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,598
Excuse me.
Do you know anyone named Wesley?

340
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,314
Oh, no, I ain't getting
anywhere near that drama.

341
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,795
This is the last time!

342
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,550
Hey, what are you doing?

343
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,596
Oh, snap!

344
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,312
Chloe!

345
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,590
Get off of me!

346
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,591
LAPD. You're under arrest.

347
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,756
Look, we get it.

348
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,673
Jealousy can make people
do crazy things.

349
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,674
Whoever this Wesley is,
he's obviously important to you.

350
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,752
Important enough to leave
threatening messages

351
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,076
and who knows what else.

352
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,433
Wesley isn't a guy.
He's my fursona.

353
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,477
Huh?

354
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,320
Wesley Wolf is my O.C.

355
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,916
Original character.

356
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,038
And Beth completely copied it.

357
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,072
That is a major transgression
in our community.

358
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,556
So Beth stole from you.
That's still motive for murder.

359
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,797
No. I tried reasoning with Beth

360
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,753
the very first night
of the convention,

361
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,759
but she denied stealing Wesley.

362
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,436
It was infuriating.

363
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,909
I was upset, yes.

364
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,755
I even threw ketchup on her.

365
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,554
But I realized there was
no point in arguing.

366
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,114
She wasn't listening.

367
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,994
I just think that Beth
was addicted to conflict.

368
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,237
- Why do you say that?
- When I talked to her,

369
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,353
she mentioned that she had
just gotten into a fight

370
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,756
- with some other guy in her office.
- Did she mention who?

371
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,437
- Mm-mm.
- Okay.

372
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,759
Well, where were you
this morning at 10:00 a.m.?

373
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,269
I was at the convention,

374
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,591
leading a seminar on building
your fursona's backstory.

375
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,190
Is that a thing?

376
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,115
How would I know?
I'm a normie... normal person.

377
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,476
- Totally normal.
- Mm-hmm. Right.

378
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,717
Boo normal.
Hey, Ellz, check it out.

379
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,033
It's amazing this
modern technology.

380
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,232
Who'd have thought I could track
your phone using my phone.

381
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,637
Oh, by the way, J-2, Daniel.

382
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,395
- J... What is that?
- It's where we parked the car.

383
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,319
I thought I'd remind you 'cause
I know you like to lose things.

384
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,749
- You're hilarious.
- I know.

385
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,037
Let's just find the girl and
get the hell out of here, okay?

386
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,276
I hate these places.

387
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,120
What? Women on
adrenaline highs,

388
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,198
massive potential for
wardrobe malfunctions.

389
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,715
Please tell me you're
not that boring.

390
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,149
I'm not boring.

391
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,518
Look, I used to love
roller coasters, okay?

392
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,949
Until I was 12.

393
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,040
I took Suzy Jeffreys
to our park back home.

394
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,873
- She was the prettiest girl in town.
- Oh.

395
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,231
Took her to the Cyclone,
wanted to impress her.

396
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,831
I have no idea why I decided to
eat all those damn chili dogs.

397
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,637
Well, looks like you
might be able to relive

398
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,718
that lovely experience
today, Daniel.

399
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,757
What do you mean?

400
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,554
Beckett's on that?

401
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,395
- Of course.
- Hmm, it's high, isn't it?

402
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,511
Beckett?
You having fun?

403
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,757
On the, uh, scariest
ride in the park?

404
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,150
I just needed to calm down
after everything I saw.

405
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,670
Do you think I'm stupid?

406
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,276
Kind of.

407
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,918
Stop her!
Somebody stop her!

408
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,753
Ah. Where do you
think you're going?

409
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,312
Don't worry, Daniel.
I've got her.

410
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,800
Uh, wait.

411
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,150
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait!

412
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,352
Oh, no. Oh, no. Ah!

413
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,151
Here we go.

414
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,755
Oh, boy.

415
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,112
- So, uh, what you doing here?
- Well...

416
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,109
With new information, like
this supposed fight Beth had,

417
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,400
I often come back to the
crime scene with fresh eyes.

418
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,910
Man, you must love
going to the beach.

419
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,471
We should, uh,
hit the old sandbox

420
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,670
after we crush this case.

421
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,351
Uh, once we crush this case,
you're crossing over. Right?

422
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,316
You're still lying.

423
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,919
You don't care about
this case, do you?

424
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,273
Well, you know what?
I care. I care a lot.

425
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,756
And I don't know why
you're here, Ray-Ray.

426
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,633
All right? I-I think it's time
that you leave.

427
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,550
I'm not lying. I-I am here for
personal, unfinished business.

428
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,912
It's just not about the case.
It's about you.

429
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,157
Really?

430
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,634
I know I agreed to stay away,

431
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,153
but, you know, sometimes I, uh,
sort of check up on you.

432
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,800
So much for boundaries.

433
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,236
And I heard you talking

434
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,590
to your brother on the phone.

435
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,719
I know you're thinking
about moving back to Detroit.

436
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,953
I knew it. You're here
to convince me

437
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,316
to move back home, aren't you?

438
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,159
No, actually, the exact opposite

439
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,478
because moving back to Detroit
is a terrible idea.

440
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,034
Okay.

441
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,756
That explains all the talk about
how great L.A. is, but why?

442
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,520
Because your freaking
leech brothers live there.

443
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,151
Hey. No one insults
my family, except for me.

444
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,594
- And they need me.
- They don't need you. They use you.

445
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,076
And the people out here,
they see how kind you are,

446
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,192
but they don't take
advantage of you.

447
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,671
The people out here don't know
everything about me, okay?

448
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,315
They don't know about you,
but my family does.

449
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,034
They know
and they still love me.

450
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,680
You know, the way
I look at it

451
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,076
is you've always looked out
for everybody,

452
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,313
but I think you deserve someone
looking out for you for once.

453
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,556
Well, that is a very
sweet thing to say.

454
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,830
And I guess I'm 10% less
irritated that you lied.

455
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,752
So is that the real reason
you're here?

456
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,952
To tell me not
to move back home?

457
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,635
Okay, that was not me.

458
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,316
Uh...

459
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,953
Why are you
hiding? Nobody can see you.

460
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,716
Nice one.

461
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,397
Okay.

462
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,960
Now kick him in the nards!

463
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,310
You let him get away.

464
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,311
Nope.

465
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,315
I got him right here.

466
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,549
Lovely, I love the, uh...
it really accentuates your...

467
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,194
Oh, my.

468
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,476
Daniel. Did you have fun?

469
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,473
Chili dog or not,
I hate roller coasters,

470
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,750
so thank you.

471
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,639
Oh, no. No, no, no.

472
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,270
Thank you.

473
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,840
Yes, Gemma here gave
me a great deal.

474
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,157
200 for the price of 200.

475
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,113
So there's enough for
everyone at the precinct.

476
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,993
Where's...
where's Beckett?

477
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,078
Oh, that little girl
is so helpful.

478
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,033
- She's the one who introduced me to Gemma, actually.
- Hmm.

479
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,391
Yeah, she just ran off to get
us a couple of churro...

480
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,671
Oh.

481
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,637
In your face.

482
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,876
She read you like a book.

483
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,675
All day long you're making fun
of me for getting duped by a kid

484
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,274
and you lost her, too.

485
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,154
You lost her.

486
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,671
Oh, that's bad.

487
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,075
This is really bad.

488
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,995
Daniel, you don't happen to have
my car keys on you, do you?

489
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,798
What?

490
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,634
She took my badge.

491
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,714
Oh. Well...

492
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,912
good news is at least
I got your phone back.

493
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,871
That little bitch.

494
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,155
Fingerprints on the broom
are too smudged to I.D.

495
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,471
All I got were traces
of chalk and rosin.

496
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,272
- Rosin?
- Yeah, a substance with, like, a gajillion uses:

497
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,791
adhesives, soap, chewing gum,
hard to narrow down.

498
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,990
I think I got something.

499
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,155
This is surveillance footage

500
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,238
from the traffic light
near Beth's office.

501
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,916
This car sped away
after your tussle with that man

502
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,635
and was there during the fight
that Iris told us about.

503
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,836
- Sweet.
- Sweet.

504
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,157
Who is it?

505
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,431
Well, the license plate
and the driver aren't visible,

506
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,120
but we do have this.

507
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,356
It's a bumper sticker

508
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,880
from Rancho Middle School

509
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,639
where Felix and
Beckett attend.

510
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,559
Chalk on the broom.
I-It could be a teacher.

511
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,240
- I know.
- Hmm?

512
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,920
We know that there was chalk
on the broom, right?

513
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,915
Could be a teacher.

514
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,520
Mm, maybe, but which one?

515
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,593
Well, you know what else
rosin is used for?

516
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,950
A violin bow.

517
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,199
Didn't Felix leave his violin
in Beth's office?

518
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,716
Look up the music teacher.

519
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,795
There he is, Jonathan Burke.

520
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,997
You're good.

521
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,031
Okay. Yes, I-I was
in Beth's office,

522
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,640
but I'm really sorry
I scared you.

523
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,109
What were you trying to do?

524
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,118
Destroy evidence that
you murdered Beth?!

525
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,280
No, no. I was, um, I was going
to retrieve this.

526
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,439
A check for five grand.

527
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,956
I was worried that it would
lead the police to me.

528
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,471
What was the money for?

529
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,950
Felix is my best student.

530
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,913
He's the best student
I've ever seen.

531
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,870
The kid is destined
for stardom.

532
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,072
I was hoping that
he'd take me with him.

533
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,039
So, what? You were trying
to bribe Beth

534
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,398
because she was helping him
to spend less time on violin

535
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,590
and be more social?

536
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,156
The opposite. Beth recommended
that he play more.

537
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,399
Start homeschooling
and take private lessons,

538
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,034
leaving me behind.

539
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,199
So you were trying to bribe her
to change that recommendation.

540
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,516
It still sounds
like motive.

541
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,792
- Well, I have an alibi.
- Mm.

542
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,716
I was teaching ninth grade
chamber class

543
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,036
when Beth was murdered.

544
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,469
You-you can call the school.

545
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,912
If that's actually true,
then we're back to bupkes.

546
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,993
Unless Dan got a lead
from Beckett.

547
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,516
Beckett Wilson?

548
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,795
Well, it figures that
she'd be involved.

549
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,195
She a student of yours?

550
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,233
Was. The kid's a nightmare.

551
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,397
I nearly ran her over
this morning on her scooter.

552
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,080
She was ditching first period.

553
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,557
Where are Beckett
and Dan, anyhow?

554
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,556
What, Beckett?

555
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,592
Yup. I'm looking right at her.

556
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,000
Dan, where are you?

557
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,873
You were supposed to be
at the precinct hours ago.

558
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,873
I... uh, yeah.

559
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,480
Sorry. Battery.

560
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,439
What,
you couldn't run?

561
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,916
I mean, it is your car.

562
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,635
Oh, I'll get it back,
unlike your dignity.

563
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,833
I make mistakes, man.

564
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,995
But guess what?

565
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,317
So do you.
You're not perfect, you know.

566
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,233
You know what, man?

567
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,872
It's a big deal now.
All right?

568
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,036
I just talked to Chloe.

569
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,509
Beckett, she's a suspect.

570
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,950
So we got to call in
some backup.

571
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,192
Agreed. Agreed.

572
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,110
And I think we both know who's
best at hunting down humans.

573
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,714
No. No.

574
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,032
What'd you two idiots do now?

575
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,760
Um...

576
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,152
Let me
get this straight.

577
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,640
So, you lost a 14-year-old kid
and she stole your badge

578
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,312
and your car?

579
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,870
It's annoying, isn't it?

580
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,834
Well, it is
when she does it.

581
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,236
Listen, Maze,
I know torture's your thing,

582
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,874
but are you gonna
help us or not?

583
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,554
Oh, yeah.

584
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,390
Yeah, I have got
to meet this kid.

585
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,070
Excellent.

586
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,359
Lucifer said to
put it on his tab.

587
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,597
How old are you?

588
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,150
This old.

589
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,075
Maze.

590
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,316
- Stop!
- Easy, easy.

591
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,796
- She's a minor.
- No, no, not easy, Daniel.

592
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,753
This little hellion
deserves to be punished.

593
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,156
Okay, now I'm seriously
traumatized. Ow!

594
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,670
Maze, let-let her go.
Come here.

595
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,112
Do you have any idea how
much trouble you're in?

596
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,870
This is serious, Beckett.

597
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,276
You're a murder suspect.

598
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,470
What?

599
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,000
I-I didn't kill anyone.

600
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,392
Truth is, I didn't really
see much, either.

601
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,193
I just said I did
so I could skip class.

602
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,193
I'm in major trouble, huh?

603
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,637
Look, Beckett...
everyone makes mistakes.

604
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,750
As long as we learn from them
and we try hard to fix them.

605
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,119
Now tell me the truth
from the beginning.

606
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,991
- So Beckett was lying?
- Yes, ma'am.

607
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,270
At the time of the murder,

608
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,035
she was hustling some guy
named Rocco at a pool hall.

609
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,191
It checks out.

610
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,796
That's quite an act she was
putting on at the crime scene.

611
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,116
Right. That's the other thing.

612
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,876
Turns out Beckett's tears
weren't entirely fake.

613
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,796
I guess she's, uh, allergic
to fragrance, freesia?

614
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,116
She said Beth's office reeked of
perfume when she found her dead.

615
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,670
Perfume.

616
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,910
All right. Thanks, Dan.

617
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,671
So, I didn't exactly tell
Chloe the whole story.

618
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,999
Ah, no need.
We all make mistakes.

619
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,073
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

620
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,716
- Hey, Ella.
- Oh!

621
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,760
Sorry. I'm a little
jumpy today.

622
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,039
I noticed.
What's going on?

623
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,440
What would you say

624
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,756
if I told you that I...

625
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,678
am thinking of,
um, new hobby.

626
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,998
Collecting protractors
or <i>Star Trek</i> phasers.

627
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,316
Which do you
think is cooler?

628
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,429
Um, well, I think
they're both really cool,

629
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,190
but... I know that
it's probably really hard

630
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,393
thinking about moving home
and I don't know.

631
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,353
Do you-you want
to talk about it?

632
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,750
Okay, well, I'm here if you do
and I completely understand

633
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,440
if you need to be
around your family.

634
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,715
Absolutely. But, Ella,
this place, all of us,

635
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,230
we won't be the same
if you leave.

636
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,794
I mean, I know I won't be.

637
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,351
Thanks.

638
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,191
Uh, so, what's up?

639
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,912
Okay, so I just got
off the phone with Dan

640
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,198
and I think I know
who our next suspect is.

641
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,840
Um, I'll catch up with you
in a minute.

642
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:41,877
Okay.

643
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,111
Just say it.

644
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,870
I understand why you
chickened out.

645
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,434
It was too risky, okay?

646
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,751
You do?

647
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,192
Yeah. You're afraid that
people, even nice people,

648
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,360
wouldn't accept people
who talk to dead people.

649
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,796
- But...
- No but. Okay?

650
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,430
You don't know what it's like
to tell someone the truth

651
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,030
and have them look at you
with pity in their eyes

652
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,516
like you're crazy.

653
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,480
And if my friends here
ever looked at me like that,

654
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,035
it would break my heart.

655
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,594
I think your
coworkers here

656
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,393
are real friends, like Chloe...

657
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,677
Chloe is the nicest person ever.

658
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,349
Okay? But she's all about things

659
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,319
that she can see
and prove

660
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,153
and I don't think
that she'd get it.

661
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:29,793
And the truth is, I don't want
to give her the chance not to.

662
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,396
Ray-Ray.

663
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,193
The neighbors have
a construction dumpster.

664
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,080
Holy smokes.

665
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,640
You know, I love
your perfume.

666
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,836
What is that? Freesia?

667
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,955
- Yes. Thank you.
- That music,

668
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,230
it's beautiful.

669
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,590
You must be so
proud of Felix.

670
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,120
He's so talented.

671
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,789
- Well, he never puts that violin down.
- Really?

672
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,071
My daughter, she goes through
interests like candy.

673
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,994
I can't get her to
commit to anything.

674
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,396
Commitment has never
been Felix's problem.

675
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,000
He loves his violin.

676
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,157
Once, he walked out the door
without pants,

677
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,073
but he still
had his violin.

678
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,713
So, he would never
leave it behind,

679
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,434
like at a therapist's office?

680
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,438
Oh, God no.
He sleeps with the thing.

681
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,075
Hmm. And how
did you feel

682
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,079
when Beth recommended that
Felix do homeschooling

683
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,112
so he could play
violin full-time?

684
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,835
I'm sorry,
but that's not right.

685
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,555
Um, Beth recommended that
Felix stay in his school.

686
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,154
In fact,
she was encouraging him

687
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,591
to branch out
with new activities.

688
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,194
At least,
that's what Anthony told me.

689
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,158
And where is Anthony now?

690
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,712
What the heck
are you doing?

691
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,115
Where would you hide
a murder weapon?

692
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,233
Not in your trash.
That is way too easy.

693
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,715
Your neighbor's trash, maybe.

694
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,877
But a construction dumpster?
Perfect.

695
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,156
You're really good
at this stuff, you know.

696
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,920
Even though it is, um, gross.

697
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,873
Yeah. I mean,
this is my <i>thang!</i>

698
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,520
And you know what they say.

699
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,714
One man's trash is
a forensic scientist's treasure.

700
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,837
One murder weapon,

701
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,359
with dried blood
from the victim to boot.

702
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,914
Duck!

703
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,918
I really wish
you hadn't found that.

704
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,437
Freeze!

705
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,472
Lower the bat, Anthony.
It's over.

706
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,196
We know Felix didn't leave
his violin at Beth's.

707
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,595
He followed you there,

708
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,474
and has been covering
for you ever since.

709
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,160
You don't understand.

710
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,871
I sent Felix to Beth
to help him,

711
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,709
not make him worse.

712
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,596
He doesn't have any friends.

713
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,433
He doesn't have a life.

714
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,799
"Play the violin more."

715
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,520
That's not normal.

716
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,832
You're right,
that's not normal.

717
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,599
It's amazing.

718
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,432
And that's what
makes him special.

719
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,954
Put your hands
behind your back.

720
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,551
Thanks.

721
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,400
I see ghosts.

722
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,193
Well, more like "ghost."

723
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,672
I see one ghost.

724
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,520
Okay, um...

725
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,720
I think I'm gonna need
a bit more.

726
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,200
Okay, so...

727
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,350
when I was eight years old,

728
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,511
I was in a really,
really bad car wreck.

729
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,875
And-and that's when I
saw her for the first time.

730
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,877
And at first, I thought
she was just a figment

731
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,720
of my imagination,
from the trauma.

732
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,355
But she kept coming back.

733
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,871
And-and-and then I thought

734
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,237
she was just an
imaginary friend.

735
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,111
But as I got older,
I realized

736
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,994
that she wasn't imaginary,
she was real,

737
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:15,036
because she felt so...
so real to me.

738
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,230
And that's when she
told me she was a ghost.

739
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,990
So I have a friend
who's a ghost.

740
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,632
Or at least... at least
I hope that's what she is,

741
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,071
'cause if it really is
just all in my head,

742
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,749
then I'm legit crazy.

743
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,470
Do you think I'm crazy?

744
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,791
No.

745
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,753
It-It's...

746
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,470
definitely
a-a lot to process...

747
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,470
but no, Ella,
I don't think you're crazy.

748
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,030
Honestly, I have seen

749
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,754
a lot crazier things.

750
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,351
Like, a lot.

751
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,959
And besides,
there is nothing that...

752
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,594
that you could tell me
that would change

753
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,479
they way I feel about you.

754
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,670
Come here.

755
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,437
You okay?

756
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,873
I've never been better.

757
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,156
Oh, and any news
on the move to Detroit?

758
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,272
Detroit <i>schmetroit.</i>

759
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,790
- I ain't moving back there.
- Oh...

760
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,878
Hell no.

761
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,190
Yeah, girl!

762
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,677
- Makes me so happy.
- Thanks.

763
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,599
- Good job tonight.
- Thanks.

764
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,950
Told ya.

765
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,310
See? I told you
your friends are great.

766
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,879
The best.

767
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,674
So... a deal's a deal.

768
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,520
I said I would leave after,
uh, this case was closed,

769
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,394
so I guess this is <i>adios.</i>

770
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,718
Uh, wait...
question.

771
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,597
If you say you're here
to look out for me,

772
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,631
is that what you've been doing
since the car wreck?

773
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,949
Sort of like a...
I don't know,

774
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,919
ghost guardian angel?

775
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,472
You could say I'm just a
friend who's got your back.

776
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,593
Well, I suppose you can
check on my back,

777
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,798
you know, once in a while.

778
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,630
But, seriously, don't
spy on me in the shower.

779
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,191
Deal.

780
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,356
Well, smell you later, Lopez.

781
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,997
Uh, what is that?

782
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,112
Well, I think
it speaks for itself,

783
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,034
but unfortunately,
I'm sworn to secrecy.

784
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,512
Hmm.

785
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,233
Well, you do you.

786
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,874
Oh, I always do.

787
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,313
Smell you later,
Lucifer.

788
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:53,997
Uh, Ms. Lopez?

789
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,510
Hmm?

790
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,235
Since when do you use
that particular turn of phrase,

791
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,677
"Smell you later"?

792
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,270
I've never heard you
say that before.

793
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,118
Oh, it's just something
my friend Ray-Ray says.

794
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,599
I know you're here.

795
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,192
Come on,
time to show yourself.

796
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,398
Well, hello, Azrael.

797
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,957
What, too cool to
call me Ray-Ray anymore?

798
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,038
Well, endearing nicknames
are reserved for siblings

799
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,596
who didn't abandon me
for millennia, so...

800
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,873
I didn't abandon you.
I've been busy.

801
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:51,718
Oh.

802
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,752
I mean, you try being
the Angel of Death.

803
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,839
- A lot of people die, Lu.
- You're telling me.

804
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,520
Okay, I get it, you're pissed.

805
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,631
I should have
reached out to you

806
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,559
when Dad kicked your butt
down to Hell.

807
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,439
And I was going to,
but, you know,

808
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,836
a day turned into a week,
which turned to, you know,

809
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,996
a thousand years,

810
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,471
and then it just seemed weird.

811
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,434
Well, congratulations.
Weirdness averted.

812
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,036
Uh, you weren't there, Lu.
You don't know.

813
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,430
When Dad kicked you out,

814
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,189
the whole family was rocked,
me especially.

815
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,199
- Oh, really? Why is that?
- Because,

816
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,234
I lost my favorite
big brother, you dope.

817
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,310
Come on, Lu.

818
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,239
Remember when we
used to prank Amenadiel?

819
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,834
Please tell me he still has
that hilarious angry face.

820
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,037
Still angry.
Still hilarious.

821
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,631
Mostly, I just missed you
listening to me

822
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,230
drone on about whatever
was on my mind.

823
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,474
I know it may have not
meant much to you,

824
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,956
but it mattered
a lot to me.

825
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,353
Look, I-I'm sorry.
I-I made a mistake.

826
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,912
But you started
a freaking rebellion, Lucifer.

827
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,596
Nobody's perfect.

828
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,076
I suppose you're
right about that.

829
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,394
But why are you here now,

830
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,239
and how does Ms. Lopez
know of you?

831
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,476
Oh, that.

832
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,074
Oh, don't worry,
I'm not Dad.

833
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,476
I have no qualms with you
interacting with humans.

834
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,959
Well, come on.

835
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,877
Ella was in a gnarly car wreck

836
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,833
when she was young,
and I showed up to,

837
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,679
you know, do my
Angel of Death thing.

838
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,111
But what, false alarm?

839
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,680
It happens.

840
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,157
This time, I don't know,
I-I didn't want to leave.

841
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,316
I mean, you know Ella.

842
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,840
There's just
something about her.

843
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,515
She's so positive.
She makes you feel like...

844
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,789
Good about yourself.

845
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,269
Yeah! Exactly!

846
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,472
I only ever get to
talk to <i>dead</i> humans.

847
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,037
I mean, they're so morose.

848
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,199
Anyway, whenever I was
in the neighborhood,

849
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,869
I'd stop by, see
how she was doing,

850
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,230
and we became friends.

851
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,114
But apparently,
it's weird

852
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,437
if people talk to
invisible angels.

853
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,437
So I told her I was a ghost,
which didn't help.

854
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,192
So I sent her to be
out here with you.

855
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,600
You did what?

856
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,153
First, Dad puts
the detective here,

857
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,915
and now you're trying
to manipulate me with Ms. Lopez.

858
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,880
Why does everyone think
I need help meeting women?

859
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,630
Relax.
I-I didn't do it for you,

860
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,194
I did it for her.

861
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,359
Well, both of you, I guess.

862
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,035
See, since I couldn't really
be with her,

863
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,634
and I couldn't be with you,

864
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,395
I thought at least
two of my favorite people

865
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,671
could be together.

866
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,678
And that's the only reason
that you're here?

867
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,956
Pretty much.

868
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,630
Listen, Azrael...

869
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,315
- Uh, everything okay?
- Yes.

870
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,954
Yes. I was just wondering
how it's going

871
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,231
with my good friend,
Ms. Lopez,

872
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,752
as I just heard you'll be
staying with us a while longer.

873
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,116
Excellent choice,
by the way.

874
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,516
Yeah, I mean,
I was just, you know,

875
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,394
comparing DNA on a block
of regular wood

876
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,397
versus synthetic wood.

877
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,193
- Oh.
- So, the cells in the synthetic...

878
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,000
Sorry, you were probably
just being polite.

879
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,356
No, no, no, no.
Not at all.

880
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,631
Please, tell me more.
I'm all ears.

881
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,710
Oh, well, it's fascinating.

882
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,156
See, the plastic
preserves the DNA.

883
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,635
Right? But with
the regular wood,

884
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,792
the cells get soaked up,
kind of like, um,

885
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,957
like a parasite
fusing with its host, right?
