1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,680
<i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,473
The reason I started
granting favors again

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,160
- was because of the Sinnerman.
<i>- Do you think this is</i>

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,357
<i>the same guy that kidnapped zou
and dumped you in the desert?</i>

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,472
- I may need proof that this guy is real.
- He is real.

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,557
And very dangerous.

7
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,353
I quit my job.
Today is my first day

8
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,517
in the district attorney's
office. Surprise.

9
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,189
So why is your
gift desire?

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,437
Desire is the ultimate
expression of free will.

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,439
I help people do whatever
or whomever they want.

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,472
- Hello.
- I thought you were looking for me.

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,558
Come on. Let's talk.

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,877
In here!

15
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,470
You want to do
your little desire shtick?

16
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,751
When I find out
what someone truly desires,

17
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,031
I find out
their greatest weakness.

18
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,799
Why is this case
so important to you?

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,434
The Sinnerman killed my brother.

20
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,160
- I need to make him pay.
- That's him.

21
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,032
You're under arrest.

22
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,675
Look into my eyes!

23
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,714
Now you will never
know what I want.

24
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,238
911. What is your emergency?

25
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,035
Please, I need help!
He's gonna kill me! Please!

26
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,635
Ah-ha!

27
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,317
Nothing screams weekend like
tequila and scantily-clad women.

28
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,194
And tequila. Cheers.

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,834
- It's Wednesday.
- Mmm.

30
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,630
Exactly. The party's just begun.

31
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,990
Why are we celebrating again?

32
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,873
Well, isn't it obvious?

33
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,914
We apprehended the cad who
arranged for my kidnapping,

34
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,071
gave me wings,

35
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,316
took away my devil face.

36
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,955
Finally, Maze,
answers will be mine.

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,270
Right.

38
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,954
If you could say that
with less sarcasm, I'd appreciate it.

39
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,634
No, no, I'm sure you're right.

40
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,470
I'm sure a human jail
will stop a soldier of God.

41
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,440
That's actually <i>more</i> sarcasm.

42
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,630
I'm just saying,

43
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,240
devil face, wings... big deal.

44
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,194
If he wanted to hit you
where it really hurts,

45
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,039
there are other things
he could do to you,

46
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,358
<i>or</i> take away.

47
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,076
- Oh.
- I'm talking about your life in L.A., Lucifer.

48
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,079
The club, your job.

49
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,591
- Chloe.
- I know what you're talking about!

50
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,636
But I won't allow it.

51
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,036
I can assure you,
the only threat

52
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,994
the Sinnerman poses from now on
is that ridiculous name.

53
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,836
Mmm.

54
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,997
They're bringing him in for
questioning in the morning,

55
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,112
so I'll get what I need
to break him then.

56
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,519
Good luck mojoing a blind guy.

57
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,393
I don't need eyes

58
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,832
to find out the Sinnerman's
desire, ergo his weakness.

59
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,549
There are other ways
to learn what someone wants.

60
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,671
What ways?

61
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,080
Just... ways.

62
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,078
Oh!

63
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,270
Hello.

64
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,870
It's so hard.

65
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,199
Yes, always, but why don't I
help you with your stick first?

66
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,594
Go on!

67
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,076
- Oh, condoms!
- I'm gonna enjoy every condom!

68
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,509
They're the ribbed kind!

69
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,829
T minus ten, people.

70
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,397
Yes, sir.

71
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,829
The prisoner is in the house.

72
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,912
Eye on the prize, no screwups,
and no one talks to him alone.

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,118
Man, I just love
watching Pierce work.

74
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,074
It's like a master
class in ass-whoop

75
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,476
with a minor in whatevs.

76
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,351
Yeah.

77
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,999
I'm just surprised
at how well he's holding up.

78
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,998
Well, it is his job.

79
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,390
No. I mean, it's just,

80
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,597
there's no way
I could be that stoic

81
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,439
if the Sinnerman
had killed my brother.

82
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,153
Wait, what?

83
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,360
I knew the case was personal,
but his own flesh and blood?

84
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,478
Holy bananas, he must
totally need a hug.

85
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,511
Ella, wait.

86
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,473
But Pierce needs our
support right now.

87
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,558
I didn't know
it wasn't common knowledge.

88
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,712
All right, this isn't even
my secret to share.

89
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,435
Right, of course,
'cause he's so private

90
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,190
and brooding and... hot.

91
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,958
Not that that is
at all relevant.

92
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,640
Look, he's on edge.

93
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,036
Just don't bring it up, okay?

94
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,117
Okay.

95
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,754
Right.
Through this way. Come on.

96
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,074
Keep going this way.

97
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,438
Nice to see you all again.

98
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,993
- What. Too soon?
- Come on.

99
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,396
Yeah, yeah.

100
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,638
He's certainly
oozing remorse.

101
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,392
Pierce.

102
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,080
We know
he kidnapped Lucifer,

103
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,919
we have physical evidence
tying him to the hair salon,

104
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,315
the kid with broken legs.

105
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,113
I saw him with a gun,

106
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,551
standing over the guy
he shot. Don't worry.

107
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,792
At this point, a confession's
just icing on the cake.

108
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,036
It's over.

109
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,991
Is it?

110
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,237
Ah, good.

111
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,511
Just in time for the main event.

112
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,518
Right. Why don't you two
make yourselves comfortable,

113
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,713
and I'll take first crack
at Helen Killer here.

114
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,757
What? I thought he deserved

115
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,394
a new nickname
now that he's blind.

116
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,796
I mean, you have to admit, the
Sinnerman has become a tad old.

117
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,070
Not happening.

118
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,398
Last time you
talked to him,

119
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,590
he gouged
his own eyes out.

120
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,998
Yes, a minor inconvenience,
especially for him.

121
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,151
I mean,
can you imagine living in L.A.

122
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,238
and not being able
to enjoy the sunset?

123
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,874
Yeah, there's not much of a view
from prison.

124
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,110
That's not the point.

125
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,118
- No one's talking to him but me.
- What?

126
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,879
You can't seriously
be suggesting

127
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,992
that you're the impartial party
here.

128
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,919
I mean, he's clearly
your Moby Dick,

129
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,634
and we all know
what happened to Captain Ahab.

130
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,836
Felled by savage revenge,

131
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,440
dragged to the bottom
of the sea?

132
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,872
Gosh, did they teach you nothing
at cop school?

133
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,474
I've read <i>Moby Dick</i> six times.

134
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,916
Oh, really. What
happened on page 83?

135
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,551
So, what should I call you?

136
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,160
- Sinner, is it?
- Ah.

137
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,629
Mr. Man?

138
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,920
A census taker once tried
to test me.

139
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,911
- Excuse me?
- I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti.

140
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,117
Ah. No. I'm-I'm sorry.

141
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,079
Always wanted to do that.

142
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,078
I mean...

143
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,920
Do love that film, though.

144
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,436
Interesting time to make jokes
when two people are dead.

145
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,517
Mm.

146
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,036
Whatever
your name is,

147
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,550
this insanity plea...
it's not gonna fly.

148
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,514
You may be sick,
but I know you're not crazy.

149
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,591
Nope.

150
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,556
There's a definite method
to my non-madness.

151
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,479
- Care to elaborate?
- No.

152
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,314
No, you'll figure it out.

153
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,910
Eventually.

154
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,031
Doesn't matter.

155
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,876
We've got enough to put you
away for a long, long time.

156
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,877
Oh, speaking of,

157
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,116
what time is it?

158
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,279
I can't see my watch.

159
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,716
- Ella.
- The Sinnerman's phone from evidence.

160
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,434
I'd pick up if I were you.

161
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,512
Oops.

162
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,517
Too late.

163
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,994
Or you better hope it's not.

164
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,440
No! Please! Please!
Will you please help me?!

165
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,511
What is that?

166
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,878
A woman
trapped in a reservoir

167
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,275
that will fill with water,

168
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,636
oh,

169
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,672
pretty soon, I'd say.

170
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,199
Another victim?
How is that possible?

171
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,760
Always keep 'em guessing.

172
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,872
Where is she?!
Who else are you working with?

173
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,233
Well, I <i>could</i> tell you,
but what fun would that be?

174
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,635
Please help!

175
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,758
The only way she'll survive

176
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,360
is if I take you to her.

177
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,070
Right.

178
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,639
Who's up for a field trip?

179
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,875
911. What is your emergency?

180
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,992
Please. Please, I need help!

181
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,357
Please. He's gonna kill me!
Please!

182
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,072
This is her
initial 911 call.

183
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,156
The Sinnerman was in custody
when this woman was abducted,

184
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,551
which means he's working
with someone on the outside,

185
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:49,998
an accomplice.

186
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,117
Right.

187
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,840
Find the accomplice,
find the girl.

188
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,996
Ella, what do we know about her?

189
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,551
Uh, yeah. Maggie Cole,
26, lives in Echo Park.

190
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,679
Tech tried pinging her cell,
but the battery's gone dead.

191
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,951
What about tracing the call
from the Sinnerman's phone?

192
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,675
Blocked and rerouted
through a server in Delhi,

193
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,912
so, like, zilch way
to track her, which is...

194
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,554
Wonderful news!

195
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,150
Means we can
save the life

196
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,352
of poor, doomed Maggie
the far more expedient way.

197
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,234
We are not letting the Sinnerman
out of here.

198
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,920
He clearly desires freedom,
which means

199
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,873
he's motivated and likely
telling the truth.

200
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,992
Following his lead
will be much faster

201
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,556
than running down clues,
dodging red herrings

202
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,752
and following up on
random tips from every

203
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,155
Tom, Dick and Dullard.

204
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,231
Hey, guys.

205
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,436
Uh, unis... they checked out
the parking lot

206
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,471
at Maggie's apartment.

207
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,909
No sign of her or her car.

208
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,719
Ah. See? I'm telling you.

209
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,230
Obi Wan Can't-See-Me
is Maggie's only hope.

210
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,954
This is an obvious escape plan.

211
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,397
Find another way.

212
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,511
Fine.

213
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,151
Fine. If you insist on doing it
the long way and investigate,

214
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,875
we may as well hurry up and
inevitably get back to my idea.

215
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,390
Okay. What is Trixie doing

216
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,080
coloring crime scene photos
at a desk

217
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,715
when we have a psychotic killer
in custody?

218
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,633
Well, she's done wonders with
that mangled corpse, though.

219
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,274
Very artistic.

220
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,160
Didn't you book Mrs. Baczynski?

221
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,477
Look, I meant to, Chloe,
but I totally spaced

222
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,239
on this random
day off school.

223
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,800
But don't worry.

224
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,436
I'm handling it,
'cause I'm Super Dad.

225
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,957
Chloe, come look at this.

226
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,037
Wait.

227
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,836
Zoom in.

228
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,198
Got a pretty good idea
where Maggie spends her time.

229
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,199
Thanks. Come on.

230
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,032
And there
they are on the first course...

231
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,995
the bombastic Blazing Banshees!

232
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,399
And their decidedly devious
opponents, the Derby Divas!

233
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,196
They're all out there fighting,
ladies and gentlemen.

234
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,960
So, Derby Divas
versus the Blazing Banshees.

235
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,516
It's derby's most
notorious rivalry.

236
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,712
Oh, ladies to go.
I'll take two.

237
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,036
- Wow.
- Whoa!

238
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,634
Nice sausage.

239
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,399
What? So, those
<i>aren't</i> ladies?

240
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,031
No. Sausage.
It's an offensive maneuver.

241
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,754
When Trixie started
roller-skating,

242
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,397
- I took her to the derby, and it was love at first sausage.
- Ah.

243
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,193
Right, well, as much
as I'd love a bite,

244
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,231
how about we get
back to proving

245
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,040
that your method of finding
Maggie isn't as good as mine?

246
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,879
Score is now two to two.

247
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,877
Hello there.

248
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,958
We're looking for some
misleading information

249
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,436
on a missing person...
Maggie Cole.

250
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,997
The Slayer is missing?

251
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,680
When's the last time
you saw her?

252
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,758
Uh, she ditched practice
yesterday,

253
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,679
and she hasn't returned
my calls since...

254
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,791
Since what?

255
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,717
Since she got
into one doozy of a booby brawl

256
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,440
with our blocker,
Helena Handbasket.

257
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,757
Helena Handbasket.
Very clever.

258
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,437
Took both our pivots
to break it up.

259
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,952
Oh, right. Let me guess. Helena?

260
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,873
And there's Helena Handbasket.

261
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,270
Y'all didn't hear it from me.

262
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,794
Right.

263
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,111
Helena, can we...

264
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,197
Busy!

265
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,316
...ask you a few...

266
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,715
No way!

267
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,836
...questions?

268
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,837
Eat me!

269
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,714
Yes, please.

270
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,799
LAPD! Stop skating now!

271
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,672
What on...
Oh! Sorry! Sorry.

272
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,192
She's gonna
rack up some more points.

273
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,030
Whoa!

274
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,515
Has to be a foul.

275
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,398
The Banshees and the Divas
are fighting it out.

276
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,960
One beer, please.

277
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,676
Is this really the time?

278
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,950
Always.

279
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,230
Cheers.

280
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,680
Well, get the cuffs out.

281
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,553
Two more, two more points.

282
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,513
The Banshees pull ahead.

283
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,957
Well, I've no idea
what the Sin Bin is,

284
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,072
- but I approve.
- It's the penalty box.

285
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:14,918
Oh.

286
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,679
- Right.
- Want to explain why you ran?

287
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,479
Because you were chasing me.

288
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,234
See?
No harm, no foul.

289
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,194
No, you ran because you
realized we're cops.

290
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,720
This is all Maggie's fault.

291
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,400
Typical, she ratted me out.

292
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,434
So, hold on, you're saying
you <i>did</i> abduct Maggie?

293
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,599
Abduct? What? No. I just
roughed her up a bit.

294
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,756
Roughed her up, why?

295
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,714
Because she stole my spot
as lead jammer.

296
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,593
- Ah.
- You know, after Faith Kill

297
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,120
had that car accident?

298
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,960
Maggie didn't
deserve that position.

299
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,470
She can't even snowplow.

300
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,080
Oh, wheels turning,

301
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,720
old theory crumbling,
and the only way

302
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,355
- to discard this witness...
- Where were you last night, Helena?

303
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,550
...a plausible alibi.

304
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,274
I was on fresh meat patrol.

305
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,756
Ooh, good for you, Helena.

306
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,957
No, it means
training a new crew.

307
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,316
- Oh.
- Shocker...

308
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,830
they sucked.
I was here all night.

309
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,190
I didn't abduct no one.

310
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,198
What about Maggie's car...
did she park here at the rink?

311
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,876
Nah.
Free lot over on 6th.

312
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,112
Maggie isn't just
a job-hogging bitch,

313
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,516
she's a cheap
job-hogging bitch.

314
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,756
Right.

315
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,477
Well, come on,
Detective, chop-chop.

316
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,036
More dead-end clues
aren't gonna find themselves.

317
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,033
Uh, hi, Mrs. Baczynski?

318
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,312
Wow. Um...

319
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,276
my-my deepest condolences.

320
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,559
Well, sweetheart,
you won't be staying

321
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,519
with Mrs. Baczynski today.

322
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,271
Or ever again.

323
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,709
Great parenting, Dan.

324
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,400
Good to know
that I'm not the only

325
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,710
questionable parent these days.

326
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,920
Uh, Charlotte.
Hey. Hi. Yeah.

327
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,352
Yeah, not my finest moment.

328
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,596
You're pretty.

329
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,076
How do you know Daddy?

330
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,554
She's my, uh,

331
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,796
work colleague.

332
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,038
Sometimes, uh, friend.

333
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,396
S-Sometimes...

334
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,351
Um...

335
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,676
how's the new job at
the, uh, the DA's office?

336
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,236
Dull. What's a girl got to do
to get a nice, grisly murder

337
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,033
or a few underage drug mules?

338
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,397
I like you.
You're funny.

339
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,433
And you're... short.

340
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,710
Hey,

341
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,150
what can I get you, sweetie?

342
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,756
Mocha whip with
a shot of "expresso."

343
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,949
Ye... Wh... No.
No, not gonna happen.

344
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,356
Mommy lets me.

345
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,991
That statement would never
hold up in court.

346
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,000
Decent poker face, though.

347
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,558
Bye.

348
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,711
Bye.

349
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,709
Daddy, I have an idea.

350
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,033
If we can find Maggie's car,

351
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,873
it may lead us
to the Sinnerman's accomplice.

352
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,715
Or be a shameful waste of the
poor girl's precious time.

353
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,833
What about wasting my time?

354
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,753
What happened
to being on the same page?

355
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,798
You know, partners?
Being a team?

356
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,713
Detective, I can assure
you this is all about

357
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,555
me making sure you
and I remain a team.

358
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,234
You know...

359
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,590
Maggie's car.

360
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,632
Plates match.

361
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,672
- Right.
- Lucifer, we have to call forensics

362
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,677
before we taint
the evidence.

363
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,633
What, and waste more
of poor Maggie's precious time?

364
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,637
Lucifer, no.

365
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,311
Oops.

366
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,996
<i>Whoever rigged that grenade</i>

367
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,113
wanted that car to explode
the instant someone touched it.

368
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,152
No trace evidence
means we still have

369
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,675
no way of tracking Maggie.

370
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,509
I can't believe
I'm suggesting this, but...

371
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,955
Okay, fine, perhaps I shouldn't
have touched the car.

372
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,197
...we need to bust out
the Sinnerman.

373
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,359
Uh... not what I was
expecting, but...

374
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,273
thank you, Detective, for
finally seeing things my way.

375
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,512
Well, you clearly
feel strongly about this.

376
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,439
For better or worse,
you are my partner,

377
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,915
so I need
to have your back on this.

378
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,636
Just one question, though.

379
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,320
How do you suggest we
get him out of here?

380
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,594
I actually have a plan.

381
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,635
But in order for it to work, you
need to do <i>exactly</i> what I say.

382
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,274
No more going off grid,

383
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,834
no more destroying
trace evidence,

384
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,110
no more Luciferness.

385
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,198
Is that clear?

386
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,840
As a chilled vodka martini.

387
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,480
Served neat, of course.

388
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,439
First we need the keys
to holding.

389
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,632
What, the same keys
old stiff-as-a-board Pierce

390
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,200
has locked away in his office?

391
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,993
Guess we'll need a distraction.

392
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,677
About that Pierce thing
this morning...

393
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,075
I cannot

394
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,437
- stop thinking about that poor man.
- Me, too.

395
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,239
He's really going through a lot.

396
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,470
Maybe a little Ella

397
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,911
is exactly
what the doctor ordered.

398
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,675
Crafty maneuver, Detective.
But do you really think

399
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,270
Ms. Lopez will fall
for such a blatant manipulation?

400
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,800
Uh...

401
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,715
Oh, my God, I'm so in.

402
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,356
But here's the thing.

403
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,835
I don't want it to seem
like I'm blabbing

404
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,151
Pierce's personal business
all over the precinct.

405
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,680
Totes understood.

406
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,839
All over it.

407
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,839
I did not hear it from you.

408
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,153
I'm going to let him...

409
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,437
tell me.

410
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,509
Is everything all right, Lopez?

411
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,194
We lost Buttons when I was nine.

412
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,039
That was our pet Corgi.
Buttons, I mean.

413
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,636
Sorry for your loss.

414
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,470
I mean, once I understood
how Buttons got out,

415
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,832
I was able to talk about it,
and the healing process

416
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,156
could really begin, you know?

417
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,040
I'll never,
ever forget that day.

418
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,672
How hard can it be
to find one tiny key?

419
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,951
Or for a tiny lab tech
to trap a hardened

420
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,799
six-foot-four lieutenant
against his will?

421
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,477
For the longest time,

422
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,957
I just wanted to find
whoever was driving that evil,

423
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,516
champagne-colored hatchback
with the custom spoilers.

424
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,432
Uh-huh.

425
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,038
But then I realized...

426
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,352
it wasn't about the hatchback.

427
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,875
It wasn't. And...

428
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,397
Where could they be?

429
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,631
Okay, assuming we do manage
to swipe the keys

430
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,150
to the holding cell,
how do we get him out of here?

431
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,397
I mean, our sightless scoundrel
doesn't exactly blend.

432
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,796
All you have to do is
go up to that bomb tech

433
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,159
and hand her this.

434
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,239
Consider it handled.

435
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,909
Seriously?
This is what you want?

436
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,160
what do you want in return?

437
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,075
Even if my charm
does work on the bomb tech,

438
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,953
and who are we kidding,
course it will, we still

439
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,152
need someone
to sell the big finish.

440
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,278
Someone deserving

441
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,637
of a very special gift.

442
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,911
Aw.

443
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,755
What's this?

444
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,837
It's too nicely wrapped

445
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,719
to be another severed head.

446
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,755
Seriously?

447
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,475
Call the bomb squad!

448
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,276
Everyone evacuate now!

449
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,800
Eat your heart out,
George Clooney.

450
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,791
Not literally.

451
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:40,958
Understood.

452
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,237
I cannot believe
that actually worked.

453
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,432
Well, it almost worked.

454
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,875
Did you really think I was gonna
let you bust him out...

455
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,271
without me?

456
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,316
Oh, put that down, please.

457
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,512
That was given to me
by the ambassador of Sweden.

458
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,557
It's very...

459
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,678
- Ugly?
- Valuable.

460
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,433
There's nothing fun to do here.

461
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,434
I can't touch anything
or jump on anything.

462
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,471
And you don't have
any toys to play with.

463
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,433
I thought you'd
be more exciting.

464
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,678
Well, you could
alphabetize

465
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,951
these case files.

466
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,993
You don't have kids, do you?

467
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,913
Actually, I do.
Two.

468
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,037
They live with their father.

469
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,390
That makes sense.

470
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,352
Um, well, it's for the best

471
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,512
since I'm so busy at work,
and if you don't mind,

472
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,871
I'd like to get back to it,
if I'm ever gonna catch a case.

473
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,833
And that makes no sense.

474
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,959
Well, if the department sees
that I'm working hard...

475
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,719
No, about your kids.

476
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,154
My mom and dad work,

477
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,919
and they still hang out with me,

478
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,196
together and apart.

479
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,439
- Good for them.
- Monopoly,

480
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,155
roller derby,
climbing the wall at the Y.

481
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,877
You could do stuff
with your kids, too.

482
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,718
Well, the truth is...

483
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,990
they don't want to see me.

484
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,789
You're the mom.

485
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,199
You make the rules.

486
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,072
Are you and my dad having sex?

487
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,076
Uh...

488
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,919
It really is true,
how the other senses kick in

489
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,960
once one is removed.

490
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,514
I can remove a few
others if you'd like.

491
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,712
Shut up and walk.
Both of you.

492
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,395
A hundred more yards,
then we have to turn east.

493
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,752
So, why did Mr. By the Book
change his mind?

494
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,916
Why are you helping us?

495
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,395
Because you were right.

496
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,034
It's the best way
to find the girl.

497
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,317
The Sinnerman
desires freedom.

498
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,677
He wants to escape.

499
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,200
I'm here to make
sure he doesn't.

500
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,993
Oh, so you really think
this is a trap,

501
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,634
that this accomplice
is laying in wait?

502
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,832
Why else would he lead us
to the middle of nowhere?

503
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,560
Right. Ambush.

504
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,880
Well, I guess we'll
just have to go nut to butt,

505
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,440
have Charlie do
the foxtrot,

506
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,114
cover each other's
sixes and all that.

507
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,874
You know? Hooah!

508
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,758
Military terms.
Weren't you a serviceman?

509
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,193
Yeah. We don't talk like that.

510
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,150
I can't breathe!

511
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,271
I hear something.

512
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,912
Help! Aah!

513
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,076
I can't breathe!

514
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,720
Maggie, hang on!

515
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,071
Come on.

516
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,199
Come on.
I got you.

517
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,795
Come on.

518
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,511
You're safe now, Maggie.

519
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,631
You're gonna be okay.

520
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,156
Where's Lucifer?

521
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,235
Where's the Sinnerman?

522
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,833
His accomplice
<i>was</i> here. Damn it!

523
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,517
They've got Lucifer, too.

524
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,192
Come on.
Pick up. Pick up.

525
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,800
Hello. This is Lucifer.

526
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,195
You know what to do...

527
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,800
preferably in the nude.

528
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,831
Damn it.

529
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,150
How could I be so stupid?
I knew this was a setup.

530
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,920
No. Breaking the Sinnerman
out was my idea.

531
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,032
- This is my fault.
- It's my watch.

532
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,836
This is on me.

533
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,875
We're already canvassing.

534
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,639
Let's put in an APB
for three men.

535
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,071
We may not need an APB.
We have Maggie.

536
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,833
I was leaving the rink,
and he chased me.

537
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,313
I made it to my car, but...

538
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,115
he was too strong.

539
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,470
He grabbed me,

540
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,036
threw me in a van,
and then I woke up here.

541
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,470
Did you see his face?

542
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,154
He was wearing a mask.

543
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,473
Sounds like it happened fast.

544
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:10,998
How would he
have had

545
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,112
enough time to rig the car
with explosives?

546
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,871
Um...

547
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,595
he must have gone back
and put the grenade in later.

548
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,636
We didn't mention... a grenade.

549
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,157
Okay...

550
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,551
Okay, I made it all up.

551
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,994
I wasn't attacked... I...

552
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,675
I abducted myself.

553
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,234
- Why?
- All I wanted

554
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,272
was to be my team's lead jammer.

555
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,630
But I could never compete

556
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,674
with that spotlight-stealing
bitch, Faith Kill.

557
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,357
So... I went to this guy
who grants people favors.

558
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,596
We need a name.

559
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,197
He just goes by the Sinnerman.

560
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,956
I asked him
to get rid

561
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,958
of Faith,
and the next thing I know,

562
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,640
she's in a car accident.

563
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,150
- I never wanted anyone to die.
- So he took out

564
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,829
your competition,
then demanded you repay him

565
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,997
by faking your own kidnapping?

566
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,713
And the 911 call...

567
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,755
the explosion.

568
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,712
He was going to kill me, too,
if I didn't do it.

569
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,635
There was never
an accomplice.

570
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,194
Then who kidnapped Lucifer?

571
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,153
No one. He wanted
to be alone with him,

572
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,840
so he kidnapped the Sinnerman.

573
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,997
Oh, good!
You're awake.

574
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,718
Just in time
for the fun to begin.

575
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,112
But, uh...

576
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,755
before we start,
one tiny adjustment.

577
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,556
There we go.

578
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,319
Much less creepy.

579
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,436
Where...

580
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,951
where am I?

581
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,192
Well, I thought we'd extend
our little field trip.

582
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,235
I save my Hills estate for...
only very special occasions.

583
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,511
My very own "sin bin,"
if you will.

584
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,710
Gosh, it's poetic, isn't it?

585
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,397
The man who desired freedom
fell into his very own trap.

586
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,554
Is that what you want?

587
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,591
To be my warden?

588
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,991
Oh, no.

589
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,273
No, the only thing
I desire is answers.

590
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:24,952
So...

591
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,076
it's time to make
a deal with the Devil.

592
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,038
You give me what I want,

593
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,637
and I might give you
what <i>you</i> want.

594
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,837
I'm not gonna
tell you anything.

595
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,277
Oh, yes...

596
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,114
you are.

597
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,794
You had me kidnapped,

598
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,390
dumped in the desert,

599
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,876
somehow made my feathery
burdens grow back,

600
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,918
and then took away
my devil face.

601
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,597
Why?

602
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,039
You will talk.

603
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,553
And you will give me
what I want: wings off,

604
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,280
devil face back!

605
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,712
Because no one decides
who I am but me!

606
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,189
Ooh...

607
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,917
I'm sensing this is the part
where the said devil face

608
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,520
would kick in, right?

609
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,155
Okay. Okay.

610
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,675
I'll tell you what
you need to do.

611
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,470
But it's not gonna
be easy. First...

612
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,678
you have to draw
a pentagram,

613
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,395
sprinkle some
powdered eye of newt,

614
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,117
and then wait
for a full moon.

615
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,076
How's your howl?

616
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,877
Freaking impossible

617
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,753
to make it through that
with a straight face.

618
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,680
Tragic error, my sinful thug.

619
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,951
Oh. What are you gonna do?

620
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,273
Punish a feeble, blind man?

621
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,234
Oh, no, no.
<i>I</i> wouldn't dream of it.

622
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,994
Oh, right, you can't see.

623
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,431
Allow me to paint you a picture.

624
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,679
Meet Hell's
most brutal torturer.

625
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,915
The pleasure's all mine.

626
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,589
Are we sure he's not celestial?

627
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,473
Are you questioning
my expertise?

628
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,239
He's definitely human.

629
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,791
- And you tried waterboarding?
- Twice.

630
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,917
Bamboo under the nails?

631
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,839
Do I look like
an amateur?

632
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,480
Nickelback on repeat?

633
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,797
- That's where I started.
- Well, what kind of demon

634
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,231
can't procure answers
from one puny human?!

635
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,318
You want to give it a try?
Be my guest.

636
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,791
Gladly. Hand it over.

637
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,559
No. I've pushed
that guy to his limit.

638
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,274
Anything else might kill him.

639
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,516
You and I both know...

640
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,758
Angels aren't allowed
to kill humans, yes.

641
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,236
Or are they?

642
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,471
Lucifer...

643
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,560
- don't be an idiot.
- No, no, no, no.

644
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,116
This is the answer
to all my problems, Maze.

645
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,038
Killing the Sinnerman
is exactly what I need to do.

646
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,359
We need to find out
where Lucifer took him.

647
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,438
Unis checked Lux
and the penthouse,

648
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,433
but no sign of Lucifer
or the Sinnerman.

649
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,273
And, of course,
his cell's still off.

650
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,278
- Any hits on the van they took off in?
- Nada.

651
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,556
He must have had a car stashed

652
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,114
and then ditched the van
on the way.

653
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,114
This may help.

654
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,432
What is this?

655
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,677
High-end real estate?

656
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,314
It's every place
Lucifer owns

657
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,239
- in Southern California.
- Part of Espinoza's

658
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,317
Lucifer files.

659
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,160
Um, why do you have
files on Lucifer?

660
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,430
Chloe and I were married.

661
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,279
So what if I did
some due diligence

662
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,312
on my wife's new
partner? Call it...

663
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,357
being protective.

664
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,836
- Not the word I had in mind.
- Stalker.

665
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,230
But... whatevs.

666
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,994
Lucifer plants a bomb
at my desk,

667
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,310
and I'm the creepy one?

668
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,594
Um... actually...

669
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,435
that was me. Sorry.

670
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,994
The bomb was fake.

671
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,520
Wow. Okay.

672
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,759
Human heads.
Explosives.

673
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,871
Can someone send me,
I don't know,

674
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,151
a muffin basket next time?
That'd be nice.

675
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,159
There's over
a dozen properties here.

676
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,272
Oh, and some are,
like, an hour away.

677
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,716
- I guess we have to check each one?
- Maybe not.

678
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,070
I think I know
where they are.

679
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,316
I'm a demon.

680
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,155
Big fan of death
and destruction.

681
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,999
But killing a human

682
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,317
is Angel No-No's 101.

683
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,557
Look at your brother...
total power loss,

684
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,274
and he only got murder adjacent.

685
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,073
Precisely my point.

686
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,590
If I kill a human,
then I lose my wings!

687
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,036
And, because I've been
such a naughty angel,

688
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,232
I get my devil face back,
and... bonus!

689
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,832
I rid humanity
of our sightless psychopath.

690
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,793
Three birds, one Sinnerman.

691
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,391
Mm-hmm. In theory, except your
Father is going to be pissed.

692
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,034
You kill a human,

693
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,754
one that He sent to do
His bidding...

694
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,280
Exactly!

695
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,718
Look, you said it
yourself, Maze.

696
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,636
If I don't stop this now, who
knows what else he'll do, or...

697
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,233
...who he might take from me?

698
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,996
Okay.

699
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,511
Wait!

700
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,431
Where are you going?

701
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,909
Happy hour at the Chateau.

702
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,356
Text me when
you've done the deed.

703
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,557
What...

704
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,035
Actually...

705
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,630
I'll be able to tell
by the plague of locusts.

706
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,834
You're sure that
they're in the Hills?

707
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,360
I mean, pretty sure.

708
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,273
He said, "Imagine
living in L.A.

709
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,392
and not being able
to enjoy the sunset."

710
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,751
I mean, just like Lucifer
to bring a blind man

711
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,400
to the place with the best view.

712
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,199
And you know him that well?

713
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,830
Thought I did.

714
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,111
Just... hope we can get there

715
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,232
before he does something
he can't take back.

716
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,709
That is an embarrassment
of riches, really.

717
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,152
So many delicious ways
to kill a human.

718
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,116
Let me see.

719
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,318
Starving rats.
No.

720
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,676
Too time-consuming.

721
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:06,837
Gunshot?

722
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:07,958
Banal.

723
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,833
Oh, I know... oldie but a goody.

724
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,520
Beheading.

725
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,633
Honestly!

726
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,674
Can you at least <i>try</i> to look threatening?

727
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:27,997
All right.

728
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,157
Well, slight improvement.

729
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,319
And I can't kill you
sitting down.

730
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,677
You need to stand up
and face me like a man.

731
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,996
Well, come on!

732
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,750
I'm to your left.

733
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,794
Your other left...

734
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,630
I'm right here!

735
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,838
Hello?! Marco!

736
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,470
I...

737
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,433
Well, there's no glory
in wrestling a starving bear.

738
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,159
Perhaps a last meal of some kind
to perk you up.

739
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,156
Hello.

740
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,830
Caviar.

741
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,839
You're going to... feed me?

742
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,874
Well, just because I'm about
to slaughter a man in cold blood

743
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,157
doesn't mean I'm not civilized.

744
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,956
No. Just means
you're stalling.

745
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,640
Don't be preposterous.

746
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,194
I've waited a long time
for revenge.

747
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,874
I'm simply savoring the moment.

748
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,357
I want you to feel your failure.

749
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,438
The knowledge that,
long after you're gone,

750
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,600
I shall continue to live here
however

751
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,999
and with whomever I choose.

752
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,072
Or...

753
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,236
you don't have what it takes
to kill a man.

754
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,760
Not many people do.

755
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,794
Perhaps you're a coward.

756
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,716
He's here.

757
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,955
Evil, smug, homely.

758
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:13,552
Bingo! You win the grand prize
at the Painful Death Raffle.

759
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,231
So, unless you want a bonus
round for being a loudmouth,

760
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,794
- I suggest that...
- Me?

761
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,593
You're the one doing
all the talking.

762
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,915
Actually, you know what,
I'll boil you alive.

763
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,719
Yeah. Top most painful way

764
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,394
to die, according to BuzzFeed.

765
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,398
Right. I'll need a pot.

766
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,437
A big one.

767
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,120
How about drown me
with a flood?

768
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,312
Or strike me with lightning?

769
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,438
What cheesy metaphor

770
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,080
would you prefer?

771
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,952
Apple, tree?

772
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,318
A chip off the old block?

773
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,071
Like Father,

774
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,794
- like Son?
- Enough!

775
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,789
Pull the string,
puppet master.

776
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,872
Damn it. Where are they?

777
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,560
Take the upstairs.

778
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,916
You're right.

779
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,550
I don't have it in me
to kill a human.

780
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,553
Uh, no. No, wait.

781
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,874
You have to do it.

782
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,111
Hold on.

783
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,794
I wondered why you,

784
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,595
the evil genius, hadn't sprung
a more clever trap.

785
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,274
It has to be you.

786
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,312
Because I was the trap.

787
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,354
You never wanted freedom.

788
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,149
Your true desire was to die.

789
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,999
And for some reason,
you need me to do it.

790
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,151
Yes.

791
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,558
Yes. You supposedly believe
in free will.

792
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,876
Then honor mine.

793
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,992
- Why do you need me to do it?
- Free will.

794
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:39,832
Why?!

795
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:40,996
Why?!

796
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,756
No.

797
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,160
No!

798
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,476
No.

799
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,116
He's gone.

800
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,115
Pierce, I'm sorry.

801
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,438
I know you didn't want it
to end this way.

802
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,916
It's the only way
it could end.

803
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,319
You have clearance...

804
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,150
You wanted to see me?

805
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,471
Yes.

806
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,238
Something very strange
just happened here.

807
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,035
Um, a "thank you for saving
my life" might be appropriate.

808
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,038
I actually wasn't
the one in danger.

809
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,197
I figured out that you're the
one who grabbed the Sinnerman.

810
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,357
Clearly, things
went south.

811
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,319
No. Let me explain
what happened.

812
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,120
What happened
was you didn't follow my lead.

813
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,630
And, as usual, you did
whatever the hell you wanted.

814
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,957
Detective, I understand
that my interest in getting

815
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,595
our blind barbarian alone
may have been a tad selfish,

816
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,190
but it turns out I was the pawn.

817
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,510
I don't have time for this.

818
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,710
It was the Sinnerman's plan to
be snatched by me all along.

819
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,354
He wanted to die.

820
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,996
Pierce smoothed things over,

821
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,270
if that's what
you're worried about.

822
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,153
The official statement says
that you were grabbed

823
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,316
in an escape attempt.

824
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,193
You think I care
what Pierce thinks?

825
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,517
No. I don't think you care
what anyone thinks.

826
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,040
That's not true.

827
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,833
I told you, I did this for us.

828
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,394
For us? For the team?

829
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,353
I had your back on this,
Lucifer,

830
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,835
and, for whatever reason,

831
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,111
you still felt the need
to go behind mine.

832
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,032
Daddy!

833
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,270
Hey.

834
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,280
So, the afternoon went well?

835
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,074
Hey, uh, as a thank you
for watching Trixie,

836
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,192
maybe we can go grab
that coffee sometime?

837
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,232
Uh, we got coffee this morning.

838
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:02,992
Yeah.

839
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,431
I'm kidding, Dan.

840
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,916
Whew.

841
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,279
Dinner would be
more romantic.

842
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,350
- Dinner it is.
- It's okay by me.

843
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,040
- Bye.
- Bye.

844
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,714
You are the best wingman ever.

845
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,398
Yes, it's me again.

846
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,230
I don't care what they
or you say.

847
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,240
I want to see my kids.

848
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,080
I'm their mother.

849
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,551
What are you
looking for?

850
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,513
Answers.

851
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,833
I mean,
there has to be something

852
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,076
in Sinnerman's
personal belongings.

853
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,477
I'll be right back.

854
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,750
I just want to say,

855
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,077
oh, my God, you killed it.

856
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,640
I mean, killed him.

857
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,593
I mean, I obvi
wasn't there-there,

858
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,031
but I just read
the crime scene report,

859
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,560
and... holy burrito bowl...

860
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,433
with your "take down
the bad dude" heroics

861
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,394
- and...
- Lopez, just stop talking!

862
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,555
What on earth?

863
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,034
Well, I'm here.

864
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,913
This couldn't
have waited till morning?

865
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,151
Time-sensitive, I'm afraid.

866
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,670
Or, in a way, the opposite.

867
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,999
Just tell me
what you want.

868
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,797
Right. Well...

869
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,316
we're both familiar
with the accomplice theory...

870
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,196
that our blind barbarian
had someone working for him.

871
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,038
Yeah.

872
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:21,878
Right, well, then

873
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,152
it occurred to me that,
what if the Sinnerman

874
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,198
was the one working
for someone else?

875
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,998
What if <i>he</i> was the accomplice?

876
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,590
Exhibit A.

877
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,393
Here is Mr. Sinnerman
as a child.

878
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,317
With a man

879
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,637
that he seems very close to.

880
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,959
Interesting birthmark.

881
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,118
It's a very similar shape
to your military tattoo,

882
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,476
actually, wouldn't you agree?

883
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,309
So?

884
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,874
Well, so it stands to reason

885
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,914
that this man would be
very, very old by now.

886
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,437
Or, if he isn't,
he'd have to be...

887
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,558
...immortal.

888
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,955
An immortal crime boss.

889
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,317
Just like you're the Devil.

890
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,630
Yes, I know,

891
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,433
it does sound absurd,
doesn't it?

892
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,360
So, as such, there's really only

893
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,553
one way to prove my theory.

894
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,035
Where did I...

895
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,509
Ah, there it is.

896
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,600
Aah!

897
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,511
I wonder why I didn't
figure it out sooner.

898
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,711
"The world's first murderer,

899
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,236
"marked by God

900
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,079
"and doomed
to walk the earth alone

901
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,760
for a tortured eternity."

902
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,440
It's quite the moniker.

903
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,200
Yet, still,

904
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,433
nowhere near as ridiculous
as the Sinnerman.

905
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,875
Wouldn't you agree...

906
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,596
Cain?

907
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,793
You may as well
pour me one, too.
