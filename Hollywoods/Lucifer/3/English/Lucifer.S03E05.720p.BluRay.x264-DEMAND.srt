1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,153
<i>- Previouslz on</i> Lucifer...
- Someone's escaped from Hell.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,675
- Who has escaped Hell?
<i>- Mum.</i>

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,997
All I've wanted is to
reunite our family.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,395
<i>I don't understand you.</i>

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,034
All right, whatever
this is between us.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,112
- I like you.
- What is she doing here?

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,352
<i>Charlotte Richards,
the defense attorney.</i>

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,914
It appears you've been busy.

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,117
I thought I'd dive
into my employment.

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,039
<i>It's not that hard
once you read the law books.</i>

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:21,878
So, what happened?

12
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,998
Well, I cut a hole in space and time,

13
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,429
<i>Mum's light flooded through it,
then it closed up</i>

14
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,710
behind her. All good.

15
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,677
Mom is gone?

16
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,717
<i>Yes.</i>

17
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,599
What is going on?
Who are you?

18
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,793
Detective, are you okay?

19
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,151
Yeah, I'm fine. I mean,
thanks to Lieutenant Pierce.

20
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,111
<i>He saved my life.</i>

21
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,276
<i>But don't worry, pal.</i>

22
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,436
<i>Luckily, Pierce was with her.</i>

23
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,477
But I wasn't.

24
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,600
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

25
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,797
Mmm!

26
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,240
Mmm, mmm. Mmm? Mmm!

27
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,431
Simon.

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,512
Working late, huh?

29
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,197
Orders went up again.

30
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,470
Got to make another batch.

31
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,431
Hmm.

32
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,757
If you don't
eat it all first, Lalo.

33
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,557
Have fun cooking.

34
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,231
Hello?

35
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,796
Somebody there?

36
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,351
Oh, hell.

37
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,437
Trixie.

38
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,394
But, Mom, I lost
Wonder Woman's lasso!

39
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,837
No excuses.

40
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,476
You know the rules.

41
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,311
Ah, good morning,

42
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,432
Detective. Child.

43
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,310
Your text said
to meet you here.

44
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,671
Yeah, I don't think it said to
barge in like you own the place.

45
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,990
Anyhow,

46
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,475
Pierce called from the hospital.

47
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,194
Because apparently
he never stops working.

48
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,311
But we have a new case.

49
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,318
What, "The Case of
the Missing Bedpan"? Riveting.

50
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,636
No, an actual case.

51
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,314
So, let's get moving.

52
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,318
Ah. Well, hello.

53
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,556
"Swear Jar"?

54
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,711
Oh, yes.

55
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,876
Trixie's...

56
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,035
You give your child money
every time she swears?

57
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,959
Oh, bravo, Detective.

58
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,560
No, no, no.
She pays

59
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,955
for every bad word she says.

60
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,799
Ah, well, then
I'm even more impressed.

61
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,153
Really? Thank you, Lucifer.

62
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,517
Impressed that you extort money
from your offspring.

63
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,949
I mean,
what a ridiculous idea.

64
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,350
"Bad" words.

65
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,640
Determined by a set
of arbitrary rules.

66
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,160
Just like my Father's.

67
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,717
Here, child.

68
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,520
This should buy you
plenty of juicy words.

69
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,040
- You swear away.
- Here, Trixie.

70
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,271
I am trying to get her
to stop swearing

71
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,391
and teach her
accountability.

72
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,193
- Ever heard of it?
- Yes,

73
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,720
I have, actually,
and I happen to think

74
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,230
accountability is overrated.

75
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,397
I mean, take your almost
getting shot at the ranch.

76
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,391
At first, I felt bad

77
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,960
I wasn't there
to protect you.

78
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,793
Eh, what?

79
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,517
You shouldn't have
felt bad.

80
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,631
Exactly.

81
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,194
Because accountability
is overrated.

82
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,397
No, because you don't
need to protect me.

83
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,000
And it wasn't your fault
to begin with.

84
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,872
You're right.

85
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,031
It was my Dad's fault.

86
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,794
- Oh... what?
- I mean, I'm sure

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,276
it was Him manipulating things
like He always does.

88
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,392
Try to teach me a lesson
about responsibility

89
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,829
or some nonsense like that.

90
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,317
Right, because that
makes more sense than someone

91
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,352
shooting at me because
I was about to arrest him.

92
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,232
I know!

93
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,432
And I am so over Him
getting in my head,

94
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,359
so, as of today, I have decided

95
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,280
I shall no longer be affected
by my Father's shenanigans.

96
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,392
Really?
Why do I doubt that?

97
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,431
But...

98
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,070
Trixie, money in the jar,
then off to school.

99
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,516
Uh, child,

100
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,800
before you do that...

101
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,789
Oy vey.

102
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,157
Someone forgot to exfoliate.

103
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,878
Victim's name
is Simon Fisher, 42.

104
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,439
Senior food chemist for
Performance Pudding Plus.

105
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,357
And apparently

106
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,596
a very clumsy one.

107
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,589
This wasn't an accident.

108
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,877
The irregular scuff marks,
those indicate a struggle.

109
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,594
Ella's working on
cause of death.

110
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,559
Well, he obviously drowned
in this vat of semen.

111
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,234
It's pudding, Lucifer.

112
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,438
Sure, I've heard it
called that, too.

113
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,280
Poor dude didn't drown.

114
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,552
And, aside from his
Freddy Krueger makeover,

115
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,560
no other wounds, so,

116
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,993
my money's on death by scalding.

117
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,395
- Oh.
- Can't be sure, though,

118
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,398
until we get him cleaned up
and autopsied.

119
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,752
Well, I'm sure our resident
pudding fan must be loving this.

120
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,111
Don't even joke, man.

121
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,319
Pudding Plus
is my favorite, okay?

122
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,790
Twice as much protein
as all the other brands.

123
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,879
Now with twice
as much dead guy.

124
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,317
Who found the body?

125
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,510
<i>I feel terrible.</i>

126
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:17,952
If only I hadn't been

127
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,957
in the bathroom so long,

128
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,230
maybe I would have
heard something,

129
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,351
seen something.

130
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,120
Maybe I could have
prevented this.

131
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,596
Quite a lot of security
just for pudding.

132
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,160
It's big business.

133
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,716
Thanks to the secret
recipe that Simon created.

134
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,470
Can't just let anyone peek
behind the curtain.

135
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,160
- Right.
- Well, we need to.

136
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,556
So, can you give us the access
to your security footage?

137
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,240
That's above my pay grade.

138
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,153
You'd have to talk to
the big man upstairs.

139
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,471
God?

140
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,793
Uh, no. The company's owner.

141
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,434
Oh. Right.

142
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,151
His boss.

143
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,757
How can I even eat this
after what I've seen?

144
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,433
Is someone trying
to tell me something?

145
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,280
Well, if He is, don't let
Him inside your head.

146
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,273
Learn from my
mistakes, Daniel.

147
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,752
Lucifer.

148
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,317
- Yeah?
- Adrian Yates,

149
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,556
the CEO of Pudding Plus,

150
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,790
is in the
conference room.

151
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,036
He brought his
security tapes.

152
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,196
Oh, excellent.

153
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,392
Who says solving murders
can't be easy?

154
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,037
Mr. Yates, thank
you for coming.

155
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,997
Your security footage will
be incredibly helpful.

156
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,431
Did you bring the tapes?

157
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,994
Sorry, but no.

158
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,554
What? Why not?

159
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,833
Because I told him not to.

160
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,270
I'm Mr. Yates' attorney

161
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,598
and the LAPD isn't laying
a finger on those tapes.

162
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,997
Mum?

163
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,833
You are not crazy.

164
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,236
No one knows you can't remember
the last few months.

165
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,799
<i>You will pretend that zou do.</i>

166
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,597
<i>Own it.</i>

167
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,480
You will not...

168
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,753
not give them a reason to
put you in a padded cell.

169
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,639
You look surprised to see me.

170
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,750
Charlotte,

171
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,196
we... just didn't expect
to see you so soon.

172
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,751
Thought your brush with death
might have changed you.

173
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,237
It has.

174
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,117
Hasn't it?

175
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,800
Back to being
Charlotte Richards?

176
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,192
Right?

177
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,752
- Why are you here?
- Apparently,

178
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,873
someone was trying to speak
to my client without counsel.

179
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,840
I am here to inform you that
a stunt like that won't stand,

180
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,912
nor will your request
for any security footage.

181
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,840
We just wanted Mr. Yates' help.

182
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,230
A friendly conversation,

183
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,597
but this makes it seem
like you're hiding something.

184
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,631
Yes.

185
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,071
An ulterior motive for
being here, perhaps?

186
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,117
Excuse me?

187
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,352
It's awfully curious timing,
you back in my life

188
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,914
with everything
that's happening.

189
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,033
This is about me, isn't it?

190
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,992
If this was a social visit,
you would most certainly know.

191
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,873
And what we're hiding
is Pudding Plus'

192
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,514
proprietary recipe.

193
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,120
Releasing those tapes
would reveal

194
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,276
how their pudding is made,

195
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,279
committing their secret formula
to public record,

196
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,278
which could cost the company
millions.

197
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,278
Besides, the killer's not
on any of the footage anyway.

198
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,914
Mr. Yates, it's best
if I do the talking.

199
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,237
But all that you can see is that
there's some sort of scuffle

200
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,596
out of frame.
The killer's

201
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,234
not visible from
any of the angles.

202
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,709
Okay, so, see,
that there.

203
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,838
That's a clue.
That means the killer

204
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,918
knew how to avoid
the cameras.

205
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,356
This could be an inside job.

206
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,835
Who-who has access to the lab?

207
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,269
I'm assuming you're
at the top of that list.

208
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,398
All right, Detective,
you can stop right there.

209
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,829
Mr. Yates, not a word.

210
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,711
We're done here.

211
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,515
But,
I'm not done with you.

212
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,796
Which part of my briefcase
closing do you not understand?

213
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,030
Uh...

214
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,994
Still waiting
for Pudding Man's autopsy.

215
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,797
Cleaning that tasty treat
off a boiled corpse...

216
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,270
tougher than you'd imagine.

217
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,358
I'd rather not imagine,
actually.

218
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,920
Adrian, I'm telling...

219
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,236
Oh, hey,

220
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,352
let's go somewhere
that's not here,

221
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,557
like... over there.

222
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,433
I hear over there
is really nice.

223
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,557
Hi.

224
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,752
Hello.

225
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,390
Did you see that?

226
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,715
She barely even looked at me.

227
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,234
It's like she's a completely
different person.

228
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,238
Yes, very perceptive,
Daniel.

229
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,557
why is she here?

230
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,836
What's her angle?

231
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,994
Dude, I cannot deal
with your weirdness right now.

232
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,031
Yeah.

233
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,116
First A.D.!

234
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,994
So,
I found seven Pudding Plus employees

235
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,351
with keycard access
to the lab.

236
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,240
Unfortunately, all seven,
including Adrian Yates,

237
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,113
- have solid alibis.
- You don't say.

238
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,631
But I did find one other person
with a keycard,

239
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,151
an old one... Adrian's former
business partner, Grace Foley.

240
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,840
She left the company
two years ago

241
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,635
to start her own
rival pudding company,

242
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,633
- Heavenly Pudding.
- Fascinating.

243
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,236
Yeah, they're shooting their
ad campaign here on Stage 69.

244
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,078
Mm-hmm.

245
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,636
Should be just past
the creepy flasher.

246
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,910
That's nice.

247
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,197
Lucifer, I know you're not
listening to me.

248
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,119
Creepy flasher? Stage 69?

249
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,073
69? What... where?

250
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,433
I reversed the numbers
to get your attention.

251
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,353
And what is so important
on your phone?

252
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,317
I'm trying to reach

253
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,552
Charlotte Richards.
She won't answer my calls

254
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,637
or respond to my texts.

255
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,433
Why are you so obsessed
with your stepmom?

256
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,233
I need to talk to her,
get to the bottom

257
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,311
of why she's returned.

258
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,034
Well, to represent her client.
That's why.

259
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,634
No, no.

260
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,910
It has to be more than that.

261
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,674
I mean, right when
I'm dealing with...

262
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,475
...with complications
my Father's thrown my way?

263
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,478
No, her return has to be
another one of His grenades.

264
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,313
Well, I thought you were done
being affected

265
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,556
by your father's "shenanigans,"

266
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,796
over him
"getting in your head."

267
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,599
You're right.
I did say that, didn't I?

268
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,439
- Yes.
- Okay.

269
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,517
Okay, fine.

270
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,114
I am not thinking about Dad.

271
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,834
Not thinking about Charlotte.

272
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,034
It's not working.
Why is it not working?

273
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,635
Maybe you need a distraction.

274
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,069
Something else
to focus on.

275
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,040
Detective.

276
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,999
You have never been more right.

277
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,519
But... No, I meant the ca...

278
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,870
To focus on the case.

279
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,356
That's it.

280
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,916
What the...?

281
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,075
Not at all accurate, but...

282
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,318
I approve.

283
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,316
Unless Dad has something
to do with this as well.

284
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,437
Ugh!

285
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,510
So conflicted,
but... can't look away.

286
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,276
No! No, no, no, no!

287
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,675
More! More!

288
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,558
Oh, come on.

289
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,274
I need more pudding!
More.

290
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,516
I want pudding everywhere.

291
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,513
This is a pudding commercial.

292
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,355
I can't sell the pudding
if I can't see the pudding.

293
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,311
And I want more pudding

294
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,000
in... what's her name...
blondie's mouth.

295
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,590
I don't care if she can't
breathe. Go, now.

296
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,711
- Excuse me.
- Geez.

297
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,640
- Grace Foley?
- Wha... why are your clothes still on?

298
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,479
I ask myself that all the time.

299
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,716
LAPD. We have some
questions for you.

300
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,360
How well
did you know Mr. Fisher?

301
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,631
Simon?

302
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,035
I'd been trying
to poach that genius

303
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,720
ever since I started
my own company.

304
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,671
Then what?

305
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,916
You got tired of him
rejecting you,

306
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,879
so you snuck into his lab and...

307
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,558
licked the pudding off every
inch of his beautiful...

308
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,398
Please.

309
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,557
You... sorry.

310
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,235
You think I killed him?

311
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,511
Vengeance, corporate sabotage,
all in one fell swoop?

312
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,194
- It makes sense.
- Okay.

313
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,518
Even if I did kill him,
which I did not,

314
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,910
you really think

315
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,759
I'm dumb enough
to admit it?

316
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,031
Especially without
my lawyer present?

317
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,313
Speaking of, let's get her
down here, shall we?

318
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,398
What?

319
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,750
She wants her lawyer here.

320
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,394
- So?
- So,

321
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,751
maybe you should find out
what she desires more?

322
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,037
Oh, you want me to...

323
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,276
- Just, yes.
- Okay, then.

324
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,596
Why didn't you just ask?

325
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,950
Ms. Foley.

326
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,598
Personal space.
Ever heard of it?

327
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,753
You don't want to call
your lawyer, do you?

328
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,756
What are you doing?

329
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,195
Come on, tell me
what you really want.

330
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,834
What's your greatest desire?

331
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,110
My greatest desire...

332
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,117
is to...

333
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,435
stop shooting
this exploitative garbage.

334
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,791
Garbage?

335
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,514
What are you talking about?

336
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,876
What you're doing is art.

337
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,752
Is it, though?

338
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,950
Well, despite
the unwelcome reminder

339
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,435
of Dad and my wings,

340
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,114
I've never wanted pudding
more in my life.

341
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,316
Exactly.

342
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,076
Because we're selling sex...

343
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,840
which has absolutely nothing

344
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,030
to do with pudding...

345
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,720
to distract people
from the fact

346
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,316
that my pudding
tastes like crap.

347
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,954
Ooh, that's an odd choice
of flavors.

348
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,156
Well, even
more motive for you

349
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,271
to sneak into the lab,

350
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,550
steal the secret recipe.

351
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,433
What? Did Simon just get
in your way?

352
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,754
I didn't need
to steal their recipe.

353
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,591
Simon offered to sell it
to me three days ago.

354
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,552
What?

355
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,513
But then, before I could agree
to his terms,

356
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,999
he was murdered and not by me.

357
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,789
More than anyone,
I needed Simon alive.

358
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,716
If Simon was selling
the secret recipe,

359
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,116
then this may not be
about corporate sabotage

360
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,556
as much as
corporate espionage.

361
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,832
If Adrian found out, he'd
want to stop Simon and...

362
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,397
Hello.

363
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,678
- Hi again.
- What's your name?

364
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,075
Ugh.

365
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,475
- Really?
- Good to see you.

366
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,834
It suits you,
that name, doesn't it?

367
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,034
Really? Can I?

368
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:53,991
Lucifer.

369
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,034
- Can you come here?
- One moment.

370
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,237
Yes?

371
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,432
So, I'm gonna ask
Grace a follow-up.

372
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,196
Why don't you

373
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,871
take your new friend and escort
her back to her trailer?

374
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,117
Her trailer?
Are you suggesting...?

375
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,033
Who are you and what have you
done with the detective?

376
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,873
Put this on her. She looks cold.

377
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,349
Copy that.

378
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,677
Darling, would you like
to take five in the trailers?

379
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,035
And that's really why I just
need to speak to the woman

380
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,232
whose body once housed
my mother's soul.

381
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,079
I don't believe it.
He's doing it again, isn't He?

382
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,680
- Who?
- Dad.

383
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,797
He's in my head,

384
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,078
ruining this moment that
you and I could be having.

385
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,760
I do apologize.

386
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,554
LAPD. Don't move.

387
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,873
Let me guess. You work
for Adrian Yates.

388
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,799
Think you've got me confused
with somebody else, lady.

389
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,110
I don't think I do.

390
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,035
Saw you watching us earlier.

391
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,310
Detective,
what's happening?

392
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,313
Sometimes big
corporations, they have

393
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,519
fixers on their payroll to
prevent corporate espionage.

394
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,915
Or clever detectives

395
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,191
from learning
about said espionage.

396
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,278
I'm not saying anything
more without my lawyer.

397
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,709
Ah, wonderful.

398
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,436
Well, if he works for Yates,

399
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,393
that means his lawyer is
Charlotte Richards, right?

400
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,920
You said there was
someone to see me.

401
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,472
Oh.

402
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,070
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

403
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,158
Is there something
I can help you with?

404
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,711
Yeah.

405
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,591
Answers.

406
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,554
What's with the cold shoulder,
Charlotte?

407
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,793
Not just back at the
precinct, but my calls...

408
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,920
you haven't returned
any of them.

409
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,237
I'm sorry.
I've been incredibly busy.

410
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,030
All that time,

411
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,470
what did you think we were?

412
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,316
What did you think we were?

413
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,560
I have no freakin' clue.

414
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,552
I...

415
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,716
You seduce me.

416
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,476
You hack into my phone.

417
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,717
You become a suspect in a case.

418
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,350
You tell me I'm
your-your favorite human,

419
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,835
whatever that means.

420
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,352
You almost die,

421
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,789
and then you ghost me for weeks.

422
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,992
Nothing about any of that
makes any sense to me.

423
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,157
I'm sorry, Detective Espinoza.

424
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,511
Dan.

425
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,275
It doesn't make
any sense to me either.

426
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,111
Whether you understand it
or not,

427
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,235
you don't just pretend
like it... never happened.

428
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:19,952
You know what,

429
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,600
I'm just... I'm
gonna let it go.

430
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,470
I'm gonna let Lucifer
deal with you,

431
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,433
because he's the only
one who ever really...

432
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,351
I guess, understood what
you were up to anyways.

433
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,909
So, Lucifer and I were close?

434
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,158
Oh, in ways that
I'll never understand.

435
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,558
Yes, I-I completely understand,
and I will

436
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,160
definitely talk to Trixie.

437
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,680
This won't happen again.

438
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,917
Thanks.

439
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,872
That was Trixie's school
calling.

440
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,077
Apparently, she's been using

441
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,113
some very creative language
today.

442
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,396
Oh. Do tell.

443
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,435
Well, she called her math
homework a "cluster duck"

444
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,233
and her teacher
a "mother flunker."

445
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,272
Did she not call anyone a
"sock sucker"?

446
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,472
What? It's just someone
who sucks socks.

447
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,239
I can't believe
you're teaching my daughter

448
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,510
loophole swear words.

449
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,074
In my defense,

450
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,397
"mother flunker" was entirely
the little deviant's creation.

451
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,920
And very clever
of her, I might add.

452
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,997
That's not the point.

453
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,032
I'm trying to teach my child
a lesson,

454
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,192
and you just made my job
that much more difficult.

455
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,631
You parents,
always with your lessons.

456
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,877
Or as I like to call
them, mind games.

457
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,637
Well, I'm about to get to the
bottom of my Father's latest.

458
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,239
It's Charlotte time!

459
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,831
You're not Charlotte.

460
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,352
And yet people get us
confused, like, all the time.

461
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,358
Hi. Larry.

462
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,396
Charlotte is busy at the moment,
so Richards and Wheeler sent me.

463
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,395
Mother flunker.

464
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,757
Where are you going?

465
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,354
Well, I only came
to see Charlotte.

466
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,199
Besides, having me here
would just make your job

467
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,119
"that much more difficult,"
wouldn't it?

468
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,750
Well, hello.

469
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,110
What...

470
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,395
what are you doing here?

471
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,071
I knew it. You <i>are</i> back
for a reason, aren't you?

472
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,598
Hmm? Hey?

473
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,314
Come on, tell me.
Why are you here?

474
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,717
Mm! Mm!

475
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,151
What in Dad's name
are you doing?!

476
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,829
Don't pretend
you didn't like that.

477
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,793
- Well, I most certainly did not.
- Lucifer,

478
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,559
I know we were close.

479
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,031
- Not that close.
- Oh, no sense in being coy.

480
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,674
- We're all alone here.
- Mm!

481
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,239
No, no, no, no, no!

482
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,430
No!

483
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,514
I...

484
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,313
I don't understand.

485
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,111
You couldn't keep your eyes
off me at the precinct.

486
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,439
Your desperate messages,
needing to see me.

487
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,157
D-Detective Espinoza...

488
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,472
heartbroken
because we were close.

489
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,752
For the f...
first time

490
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,440
since I woke up on that beach,
I thought,

491
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,279
"Finally,
something that makes sense.

492
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,234
Of course I'm sleeping with
Mr. Tall, Dark and Handsome."

493
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,200
- Uh... uh...
- But now you're saying

494
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,312
that's not...
not even that's the case?

495
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,914
Look, I can assure you
that you and I have not

496
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,079
or will not ever,
ever, <i>ever...</i>

497
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,030
sleep together.

498
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,472
Well, if not lovers,
then what were we, friends?

499
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,477
More like...

500
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,351
...family.

501
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,349
I can't ta...

502
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,355
can't take this anymore.

503
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,475
I'm...

504
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,839
I'm missing time.

505
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,750
Months...

506
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,270
and months of time.

507
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,751
It's like...

508
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,315
someone else was living my life.

509
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,715
Ruining it.

510
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,914
My work...

511
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,634
my relationships, my...

512
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,994
my family.

513
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,160
I have no idea...

514
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,438
why my husband got custody
of the kids.

515
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,270
Or why I've been...

516
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,157
denied visitation rights.

517
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,470
But ever since I woke up
on that beach...

518
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,319
I've been pretending...

519
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,716
like I remember it all,

520
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,560
Because otherwise
everyone would think that...

521
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,035
that I'm crazy.

522
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,349
Maybe I am.

523
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,710
You're not crazy.

524
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,792
You're just an innocent,
aren't you?

525
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,151
Caught up in a game
not of your own.

526
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,150
Oh, believe me,
I'm not innocent.

527
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,718
But I don't think I deserve...

528
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,597
What?

529
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,071
In my m...

530
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,593
my missing time...

531
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,874
it feels like I was...

532
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,630
trapped...

533
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,711
in some...

534
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,153
horrible nightmare,

535
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,917
reliving it over and over and...

536
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,389
over again.

537
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,269
It feels almost like I was in...

538
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,477
Hell?

539
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,955
Now you probably think
I'm crazy, too.

540
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,110
Do you realize
who you're talking to?

541
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,397
Right. Lucifer.

542
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,156
The Devil.

543
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,516
Yeah, well, if you believe me,

544
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,234
then you're
just as crazy as I am.

545
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,439
Or perhaps you knew
exactly where you were.

546
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,636
Why would I go to Hell?

547
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,639
It's not like I'm a bad person.

548
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,550
I work hard.

549
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,036
Pay my taxes.
Don't hurt anyone.

550
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,114
Well, perhaps you feel
more guilt than you realize.

551
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,120
Well, on the ridiculous...

552
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,080
off chance that Hell
actually is possible...

553
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,880
how do I make sure
I never go back?

554
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,991
Well, uh, this is
your second chance, correct?

555
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,479
So perhaps
avoid doing

556
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,871
devious and dastardly things
from now on.

557
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,594
I mean, it's boring, I know.

558
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,152
Does...

559
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,197
knowingly impeding
a homicide investigation count?

560
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,231
Uh...

561
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,515
- Why does stuff like this always happen to me?
- Because you are

562
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,872
a softy, Dan...
it's one of the many things I love about you.

563
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,639
No, what I am is a dummy.

564
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,311
She acts like I barely exist,
so what do <i>I</i> do?

565
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,357
I go to her office

566
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,517
to get rejected again.

567
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,353
You're being too hard
on yourself.

568
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,799
And eating your emotions?
I thought you were

569
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,116
giving that stuff up.

570
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,951
I can't just quit
cold turkey, Ella.

571
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,955
Not at a time like this.

572
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,272
Hey, it could
always be worse.

573
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,840
You could end up
like our vic here.

574
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,275
Guess what his autopsy found.

575
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,956
Couple of kidney stones
the size of golf balls.

576
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,837
Ouch.

577
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,350
Dude was suffering
from intense renal failure.

578
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,597
I mean, even he hadn't
been pudding'd alive,

579
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,599
he would have died within days
from urinary sepsis.

580
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,796
What are the odds,

581
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,351
two horrible ways of dying
hitting the same person

582
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,755
around the same time?

583
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,069
That's a good point.

584
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,475
What <i>are</i> the odds?

585
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,676
It says here that Pudding Plus
employs you to handle

586
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,036
their corporate security.

587
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,357
And I know that
Simon Fisher

588
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,398
compromised that security
by trying to sell

589
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,274
your company's
most valuable secret

590
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,556
to the other side.

591
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,035
- So?
- So...

592
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,550
would you consider
Mr. Fisher "handled"?

593
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,036
My client doesn't need
to respond to that.

594
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,472
You're right.

595
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,080
I guess we'll just leave it
to a jury.

596
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,352
There is no "other side."

597
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,631
Excuse me?

598
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,629
I guess Grace
forgot to mention,

599
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,513
as of a month ago,
Pudding Plus

600
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,996
and Heavenly Pudding
decided to merge.

601
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,712
Tell her.

602
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,679
It's true.
And also

603
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,276
not illegal...
last time I checked.

604
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,837
Richards and Wheeler
are representing

605
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,190
the merged company.

606
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,914
So whatever threat
Fisher posed by selling

607
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,840
his recipe
to the "other side," gone.

608
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,560
No motive for murder.

609
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,035
Then why were you following me?

610
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,798
I didn't know where
your investigation was going.

611
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,117
Couldn't let Fisher's death
threaten the merger.

612
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,870
Do you know how much money
is in pudding?

613
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,833
Detective.

614
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,554
You're needed
in the conference room.

615
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,552
<i>Ah.</i>

616
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,399
Detective, look who I found.

617
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,040
And she comes
bearing gifts.

618
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,356
The security footage

619
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,710
you requested.

620
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,475
Why are you handing
this over now?

621
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,036
- You seemed so opposed to it earlier.
- Well, it's recently come

622
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,471
to my attention that
I need to make a change.

623
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,599
So I'm trying to do
what's right.

624
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,560
If I can prove
my client is innocent

625
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,359
and help you find
your killer...

626
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,634
clean conscience,
here I come.

627
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,671
Huh.

628
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,516
You can't see
the killer here.

629
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,915
Just as my client said.

630
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,437
All this video shows
is what we already know...

631
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,519
that someone familiar with the
cameras went into this room

632
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,074
and pushed Simon
into the vat.

633
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,192
Yeah, but everyone
with access had alibis.

634
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,880
Oh,
you're not suggesting a murderer

635
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,400
actually lied about
where they were?

636
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,238
Daniel.

637
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,790
We double-checked them, okay?

638
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,679
They're all
pretty ironclad.

639
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,797
Hmm.

640
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,630
Oh, my gosh.

641
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,396
Of course.

642
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:37,998
What?

643
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,156
What the hell, Ella?

644
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,277
You're <i>welcome.</i>

645
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,676
I just saved your life.

646
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,757
Check it out.

647
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,713
Two of their
secret ingredients, right?

648
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,639
Melamine and cyanuric acid.

649
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,115
Separate,
both are harmless.

650
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,194
But when combined, they create
a hard-to-detect toxin

651
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,551
that, over time, can cause...
drumroll, please...

652
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,796
renal failure.

653
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,190
The kidney stones you found.

654
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,075
Yeah. Looks like the "plus"
in Pudding Plus...

655
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,351
is poison.

656
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,711
<i>Poisonous pudding?
Are you kidding me?</i>

657
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,070
So, Simon must have gotten sick

658
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,634
from his constant
exposure to it?

659
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,991
Well, what kind of idiot would
intentionally put poison

660
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,635
- in their own product?
- These two chemicals have been known

661
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,832
to fake the appearance
of a higher protein content.

662
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,430
- Which is Pudding Plus' biggest selling point.
- But wouldn't people

663
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,313
eventually realize
that it's poisonous?

664
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,200
- I mean, the company would lose everything.
- Not necessarily.

665
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,840
If you have hundreds
of millions of dollars,

666
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,150
and you get sued
for a couple of million,

667
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,192
you still have hundreds
of millions of dollars.

668
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,671
- But people die.
- Yeah, well,

669
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,270
it's the same calculation
the car manufacturers make

670
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,039
when they find out
they have faulty airbags.

671
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,949
Which costs them less,
recalling the car

672
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,789
or enduring the lawsuits?

673
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,229
Yeah,
but why would Simon

674
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,750
try to sell the formula to Grace
if it was killing him?

675
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,116
Unless he didn't.

676
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,549
Maybe when he found out
what he created,

677
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,876
he was just trying to stop it.

678
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,356
And who better to expose

679
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,875
Pudding Plus' dirty secret

680
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,230
than their biggest
competitor?

681
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,158
But Simon
didn't know

682
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,390
the two companies <i>were</i> merging.

683
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,159
Soon they won't be
in competition.

684
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,516
Suddenly,
everyone has motive

685
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,631
to keep Simon quiet.

686
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,433
Adrian, Grace <i>and</i> the fixer.

687
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,796
Three potential killers.

688
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,037
And as the merged
company's counsel...

689
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,313
you represent all of them.

690
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,430
Charlotte,
where are you going?

691
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,552
To join the Peace Corps
or donate my entire savings

692
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,832
to an orphanage or build a shelter for blind,
one-legged puppies.

693
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,599
Well, as long as you're
not being overdramatic.

694
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,309
I thought delivering those tapes
would help <i>clear</i> my ledger.

695
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,911
But instead, it just revealed
that I've been defending

696
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,315
<i>three</i> guilty people?

697
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,636
- Uh...
- If that's true,

698
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,274
how guilty does that make me?

699
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,350
This isn't a good time.

700
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,914
I know how you've
been treating Dan.

701
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,271
Okay? And I want you to know
that I got his back.

702
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,553
- What's that mean?
- I used to see

703
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,955
a light in you.

704
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,152
But now, I don't know,
something's different.

705
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,560
All I see now...

706
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,589
is darkness.

707
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,118
Oh, there you are.
Where'd you run off to?

708
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,999
Just needed to
clear my head.

709
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,118
- Do you think Charlotte will be all right?
- Yeah.

710
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,397
Why wouldn't she be?
That woman's like a rock.

711
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,480
Like a very mean, scary, hot,

712
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,870
well-dressed rock.

713
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,993
Yes, well...
you'd be surprised, Detective.

714
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,796
Okay.

715
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,072
Well, now that we know
all three suspects

716
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,959
have the same motive... money...

717
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,157
I looked into
the company's financials

718
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,319
to see who had the most to lose
if the merger failed.

719
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,115
And get this...
it's none of our three.

720
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,800
You really think I killed Simon?

721
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,759
Lalo, we know you stood
to gain hundreds

722
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,151
of thousands of dollars
in vested stock options

723
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,273
- once those two pudding companies merged.
- That's a lot of money.

724
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,080
For you. Obviously.

725
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,273
But, uh, it all
would have disappeared

726
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,915
had Simon revealed the truth
behind his illness.

727
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,839
You... you mean Simon
really was sick?

728
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,111
You knew about that?

729
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,194
Sure. He said
he was gonna die.

730
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,520
But I didn't take it seriously.

731
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,832
- He said a lot of things that night.
- What night?

732
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,037
About a month ago,
we went out drinking.

733
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,675
Simon got wasted.

734
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,997
He started going off
about how Mr. Yates

735
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,469
wasn't listening to him,

736
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,633
and that people were
gonna suffer for it.

737
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,192
He said something about
how it was his own fault.

738
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,794
Simon said that...

739
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,511
maybe he should just end it.

740
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,040
End what?

741
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,196
His life.

742
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,072
Huh.

743
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,953
I had no idea
what he was talking about.

744
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,516
And you didn't think
to tell us this sooner?

745
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,519
Like when he
showed up dead?

746
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,239
A bunch of drunken nonsense?

747
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,034
It's not like he jumped

748
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,469
into that vat.

749
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,556
I mean...

750
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,240
boiling pudding?

751
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,797
There's easier ways to go.

752
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,594
But none so revealing.

753
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,392
What?

754
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,114
What if this was
Simon's Hail Mary?

755
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,950
A way to expose the truth
that he felt so guilty about.

756
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,759
Oh, so you think
the man actually killed himself

757
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,440
to lead us to the toxin?

758
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,273
Well, if he did, it worked.

759
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,560
The suicide version's
looking more and more likely.

760
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,991
Day before his death,
Simon changed his will.

761
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,077
He donated

762
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,475
all his possessions to charity.

763
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,798
He even gave away
his pet turtle.

764
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,797
Huh.

765
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,837
And the scuff marks
on the platform...

766
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,999
He must have faked a struggle
to make it look like a homicide.

767
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,840
- To keep us investigating the companies.
- Huh.

768
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,790
<i>Hello,
Charlotte Richards' office.</i>

769
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,400
Charlotte, good news.

770
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,670
It was a suicide.

771
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,594
So no need to worry.

772
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,274
You won't be representing
any murderers.

773
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,797
<i>Charlotte just left.</i>

774
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,593
<i>She went to meet some clients.</i>

775
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,751
Why do I get the feeling

776
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,077
Charlotte's about
to do something very stupid?

777
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,757
So, what's this about?
Why the last-minute meeting?

778
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,036
Yeah, and why here?

779
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,913
Didn't we agree
to delay merger talk

780
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,589
until after the LAPD ends
their investigation?

781
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,154
We did. This meeting
is about other business.

782
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,834
Personal business.

783
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,555
What the hell does that mean?

784
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,274
No one's leaving here
until I figure out

785
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,432
which one of you
murdered Simon Fisher.

786
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,517
Um...

787
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,880
So, a funny thing happened

788
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,635
a couple of months ago.

789
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,196
I sort of died.

790
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,310
And apparently
there's a chance I went to Hell.

791
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,790
Oh, I know. I was...

792
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,640
I was as shocked as you are.

793
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,839
I'm feeling much better now.

794
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,232
Thanks for asking.

795
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,510
Though there might be

796
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,033
a slight chance

797
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,516
that I'm having
a nervous breakdown

798
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,320
as we speak.

799
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,511
Anyhow...

800
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,234
I've had some time to think,

801
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:54,111
and I'm pretty sure that my sin

802
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,874
was a lifetime of defending

803
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,992
known criminals and murderers.

804
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,993
Apparently
nobody bothered to tell me

805
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,720
that all the blood
that they shed

806
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,594
is on my hands, too.

807
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,111
Now, here I am

808
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,152
with a second chance,

809
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,352
and one of you...

810
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,431
is screwing it up.

811
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,839
So, speak.

812
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,680
Which one of you killed Simon?

813
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,349
- Charlotte, none of us did it.
- He's right.

814
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,399
No, I know that Simon
was about to blow the whistle

815
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,040
on your little secret.

816
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,432
So one of you

817
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,994
must have done it.

818
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,474
Why are we still sitting here?

819
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,039
I'm done
listening to this crazy bitch.

820
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,760
Sit down!

821
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,110
Why don't you make me?

822
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,470
That can't be good.

823
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,555
What the hell? You
could have shot me.

824
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,360
Very easily.

825
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,910
Now sit.

826
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,351
Look, lady, all I did
was intimidate Simon.

827
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,880
And I stopped as soon as Adrian

828
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,390
called me off. I was just
doing what he paid me to do.

829
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,194
W-We didn't need to kill Simon.

830
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,835
- We kept him quiet.
- A-And just sped up the merger.

831
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,191
We were all set to
make record profits

832
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,551
despite Simon's
nitpicky safety concerns.

833
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,355
Yeah. Why would we go kill him
after all of that?

834
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,750
Well, I don't know.

835
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,429
Loose ends, maybe?

836
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,075
I'm gonna make this right
one way

837
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,033
- or another.
- Charlotte.

838
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,551
Wait.

839
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,917
- Lucifer?
- They're telling the truth.

840
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,755
None of these scoundrels
killed Simon.

841
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,314
He killed himself.

842
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,432
A dying man's plan
to expose the company

843
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,869
and its crimes.

844
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,715
That doesn't make any sense.

845
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,036
Charlotte...

846
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,316
they're innocent.

847
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,837
No.

848
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,630
No, they're not.

849
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,354
Did you not hear
what I just said?

850
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,957
Oh, I heard.
So they didn't kill Simon.

851
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,629
What about everybody
who eats their stupid pudding?

852
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,480
They all knew
their product was poisonous.

853
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,591
Innocent people are gonna die
because of them.

854
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,031
I've lived my life

855
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,475
finding loopholes,

856
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,474
ways of evading responsibility
for my clients.

857
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,155
Myself.

858
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,750
Turns out...

859
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,913
there are no loopholes.

860
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,193
If you're guilty,

861
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,397
you're guilty.

862
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,512
I understand that you want

863
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,830
to clear the red
from your ledger.

864
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,556
But believe me, Charlotte,
this is not the way to do it.

865
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,672
Then what am I supposed to do?

866
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,909
I can't go...

867
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,113
I can't go back there.

868
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,516
Can't.

869
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,592
Then here's what you need to do,
Charlotte.

870
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,795
Trust me.

871
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,355
Thank you.

872
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,954
What about them?

873
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,550
Well...

874
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,360
whilst I was lurking
in the shadows,

875
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,836
they said quite a few
incriminating things.

876
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,431
Detective, was that enough
for a proper perp walk of shame?

877
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,150
<i>Yep, plenty.</i>

878
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,916
FBI's gonna have a field day
with these recorded confessions.

879
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,918
You may not have pushed Simon
to his death,

880
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,873
but you'll pay for your role
in poisoning him.

881
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,200
- Nice win, partner.
- Thank you very much.

882
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,392
I'm just surprised you let me
enter the factory first.

883
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,432
Oh, I figured it was your turn
to get shot at.

884
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,071
Oh.
- You know, you were right about Charlotte.

885
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,075
There's more to her
than I thought.

886
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,912
- The things she said...
- Sounded loony?

887
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,833
No. Sounded like
somebody wrestling

888
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,110
with their demons.

889
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,351
I couldn't help but overhear
what you said back there.

890
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,831
Sounds like you're...

891
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,110
going through a lot.

892
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,636
I'm sorry you're struggling.

893
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:00,991
You're right.

894
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,552
I am going through a lot.

895
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,351
But that's no excuse
for how I've treated you.

896
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,470
Well, I appreciate that.

897
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,920
Maybe we could meet
for coffee sometime.

898
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,317
Maybe.

899
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,034
Hope I'm not interrupting
anything, Daniel.

900
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,391
Charlotte, ready
for that ride home?

901
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,039
<i>Trixie, can you come out here?</i>

902
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,836
Hi, Mommy.

903
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,471
Monkey, I want to talk to you

904
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,955
about what happened today
at school.

905
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,111
Did you tell Miss Morgan

906
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,436
to "go to shell"?

907
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,350
I didn't technically
break any rules.

908
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,310
You know what?

909
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,476
Lucifer was right.

910
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,560
The swear jar, it's...
it's a dumb idea.

911
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,673
Mommy gave you a bunch of rules

912
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,630
without explaining things.

913
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,235
The real reason

914
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,760
that we shouldn't swear

915
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,839
is that bad words
make people feel bad.

916
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,716
And I know you don't want
to make people feel bad, right?

917
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,997
'Cause the truth is
if you go looking for loopholes,

918
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,634
you'll always find them.

919
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,398
And I can't force you
to do the right thing.

920
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,633
You'll just have to
learn that on your own.

921
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,594
So no more swear jar. Okay?

922
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,717
So does that mean
I get my money back?

923
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,751
Nice try.

924
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,636
Would you like to come in?

925
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,479
You're not gonna pounce
on me again, are you?

926
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,876
Because that was
a smashing success last time.

927
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,680
Come in, scaredy-cat.

928
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,229
After today, I need wine stat.

929
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,874
This whole "being good" thing?

930
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,960
Tougher than I thought.

931
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,560
It's a nice place you've got.

932
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,200
Though, uh, could stand
to nest a bit more.

933
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,640
I don't even remember
getting this place.

934
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,400
I hope you like red.

935
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,717
I'm a rosé girl, myself.

936
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,957
Apparently while I was away,

937
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,520
I bought 30 cases of Merlot.

938
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,956
Yes.
Sorry about that.

939
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,077
Why would you be sorry?

940
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,873
You're not responsible
for my lost time.

941
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,196
No.

942
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,560
Yet I can't help but feel...

943
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,160
...somewhat accountable.

944
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,354
Is that why you're here?

945
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,273
Well, this strange,
inexplicable compulsion

946
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,920
to make sure you're okay?

947
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,514
Very possibly.

948
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,070
Dad be damned.

949
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,198
You spent time with me when I...

950
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,038
wasn't me.

951
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,270
What was I like?

952
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,320
Well, you were...

953
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,156
quite the handful, actually.

954
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,271
Intense.

955
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,551
Jealous.

956
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,829
Hair-trigger emotions.

957
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,720
Prone to making
cosmically epic mistakes.

958
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,196
But everything that you did...

959
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,631
the other you did, I...

960
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,872
I know that it came
from a place...

961
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,115
...of love.

962
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,800
I will miss her.

963
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,594
More than she'll ever know.

964
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,952
But that isn't you, is it?

965
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,794
- No. No, it's not.
- No.

966
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,320
Right. Well, then...

967
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,232
I look forward

968
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,999
to getting to know the real you.

969
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,430
And I you.

970
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,557
Welcome back,
Charlotte Richards.
